Been playing since Beta and just met him last night North of vault 76. He makes a weird noise (I thought it was a machine/generator) which is how I found him.
---
Stash is server side. 
---
The FO4 assault rifle was pretty damn underwhelming too.
---
I agree with everything. As far as I know only the Austin studio is working on Fallout 76. The damage this game does is on Bethesda as a whole and I don‚Äôt understand why they aren‚Äôt pulling resources from other studios to salvage the little respect they have left from the community.
---
Just stating a fact.  
---
&gt;**SNALLYGASTER:** A swarm of these can be terrible in a good way. I like them.
---

---
If you could point me to where you find swarms of snallygasters, I need that in my life for the waste acid they drop.
---
Nice! I get legendary drops from non-legendary some of the time (maybe a dozen or two times, but I play with Unyielding Armor and luck at 20), not not all rise!
---
I wants birds and pet cats 
---
Why not just pit yourself on pacific? 
---
Nope, better to compain on Reddit.
---
Yeah the fact that it's taking so long to just change a few loot tables and a sonic blast counter, leaves me to believe it's been abandoned and only like 3 people are still working on 76. That and the fact it looks like they didnt have any plans to add new stuff to the game. Makes it look like it was pretty much abandoned by whole teams after dev
---
This. THIS is the ONLY reason I pre-ordered last June.
---
I had faith in BGS (mistakenly as it turns out) as a owner of all FO's and many ES's.
---
Lesson learned.
---
I‚Äôd rather see them just cave on their ‚Äúno NPC‚Äù thing and add them in. As much as I like seeing other players, I‚Äôd rather not complicate my login/logout process with additional bugs. Adding NPC‚Äôs is easy, creating an *APC* as you call it sounds significantly more complex for little actual payoff. I like the idea, but I would rather see more effort put into new content that expounds on my gaming experience in a more profound way than 8 more Grahms wandering about.

the 'diseased' prefix overwrites the legendary prefix.  this why you n ever see 'diseased legendary ...'  or 'legendary diseased ...'
---
it was legendary, and diseased.

enjoy your all rise.

So you paid either $90 or $180 depending on which Costco membership you bought? Plus tax.

You got more ripped than me even...

Sorry my dude I'm on PS4
---
Oh rip
---
My wife was suprised when I came home from work and didn't fire up FO76.  She didn't say anything, but I know she understood my dejection. 
---
You got killed by a rabid dog? Damn git gud

u/LadyDevann,
---
I've not submitted this one yet, but there is a finite number of items the vendors can display, the way the leveled lists were changed, the vendors cannot show all the plans they have, which I'm pretty sure is why people can no longer find BOS plans (and other plans) on the vendors.
---
It fell off the truck.
---
We don‚Äôt speak of BOS we just write it in the title üòÖ
---
Yeah,because your opinion on my satisfaction based on playing time is a valid argument.
---
Lazy, ineffectual,canned responses generally indicate a person's logic,reasoning and intelligence pretty clearly....
---
Power armor in Fallout has never made sense, not just in Fallout 76 but down through the Fallout games. In non-legendary pocket and deep pocket armor I can carry more then when I jump into a suit of non calibrated armor powered by a mini fusion reactor? When my normal strength of 19 drops to 15 in PA, huh, this thing need oil or something? We don‚Äôt need legendary power armor what we really need is power armor that does what power armor should do, enhance the performance of the person wearing it. I don‚Äôt know about having your regular armor legendaries effective while in power armor, that might get way to OP, but at least let power armor be what it was meant to be, cause right now it‚Äôs simply an armored hazmat suit.
---
I haven't even heard of that bug, that'd be infuriating. Sorry dude. 
---
A level 50 rabid dog, I‚Äôm currently level 15.
---
Commented above, the vendors can only pick and displays a finite number of plans, as I understand it, they way they reconfigured the lists, the vendors have more plans then they can display.
---
Nice comments about the Queen fight; people overstate how difficult she is in my opinion. 
---
Using any combination of Adrenal Reaction, Prime Receivers, % Damage perks, 1 relevant Bobblehead, Nerd Rage, Adrenaline and decent legendaries (people sleep on Zealot's weapons, they damage the Queen more too!) you can rip her apart without needing to exploit in any way. If you manage to stack all/most of these, you can pull some insane numbers. 
---
However even without some/most of these strong damage buffs, she is still manageable, provided you bring enough ammo/weapons. 
---

Yes, the logic is hard to follow but check it out:
---
1) haven't played in weeks. 2) needed hd space 3) looked at f76 4) went to see if there were any actual enhancements or changes that have happened 5) realized it's still a rotten ship slowly sinking 6) deleted from hd 7) came in here, made this thread 8) heard a lot of babycrying.mp3
---
My luck is only 11 lol I thought the all rise was only obtainable by doing the mayor quest. Which is why I‚Äôm so confused but yet happy lol
---
Yep, I have 2 copies myself.
---
Because it means you're playing FO76?
---
BL2 reference.  Must upvote.
---
I can see it now. Every 76 player split up into different private servers. Each with like two players. That's going to really take the game places. 
---
If it's a simulation then the BoS being there is even MORE stupid. Like the simulation designers either predicted a faction would emerge from the wasteland naming themselves after knights and stuff OR the simulation takes place after the real Brotherhood was formed and the simulation somehow collects and integrates real world data into the simulation.
---
Honestly thought it was 50/50. When I first started getting bored I came in here and saw a few threads that seem to say the same thing, or at least made comments I agreed with. All that's left is those ready to sink with the ship I guess. 
---
I think it would have been much more interesting to have some giant mutated hawk or something to fight endgame rather than a Skyrim dragon. 
---
Awesome post I'll be doing some exploring on my next play through
---
I know right? Only thing worse is if I played f76. 
---
Right?! If this were me, if I was some Bethesda suit, or better yet, a Zenimax suit, I would send out an effing mass-email titled "ALL HANDS ON DECK". The office in Austin would be filled with personnel from Rockville, Montreal, Arkane, and ID Software - even just for a month, to salvage the name.
---
Can you pass THAT on to the team?
---
To be honest, i do not mind if they add anything at all. The thing is, we are both discussing such a wide range change that I hardly believe Bethesda would implement, due to their laziness. Not that your suggestion isn't proper or anything, but they  take alot of time to address simple stuff. Even, if it was their own mistakes. For example the bobby pin changes with patch 5 which was unintentional. It took em a good while before they threw in a hotfix and even then, they destroyed a whole category of explosive weapons and grenades, cuz they couldn't differentiate between their own legendary perk explosive and basic explosives.
---
At this point, anything at all would be gr8, for better or worse. As long as we get something.
---
But you did. That‚Äôs the best part.
---
You
---
Did.

Legendary armors. That's all I've got. Freaking legendary armors.

I'm sorry,but how do I 'deserve it for pre- ordering'? Care to elaborate?

Thanks for doing that! I have submitted 0, but most of my glitches were hardware related.

Thanks

There's a terminal that controls all the functions to make it haunted in a shack somewhere. 
---
Why? They aren't ready to be released.  When they get ready to be released they will drop a preview of update.
---
Fact is we only know about these because they specifically told us about the fact they are working on them.  We know what is on the developers plate and back logs because they were being transparent. 
---
We had those in nuka world. They're literally the same as the institute gorilla, except they supposedly live much longer. 
---
Where did I say I was angry exactly?
---
Sure, like everyone else in here I wasted a bunch of time. But unlike most others, I'm cutting my losses and not throwing more time into the hole. 
---
??
---
I've seen a few games updated to death Diablo 2 and the Division. And now fo76
---
The thing is. You don‚Äôt know what criticism is. You bash. 
---
YouTube is full of videos of cats and dogs opening doors.
---
Also what was a level 5 doing in an area that could spawn level 50 dogs?
---
Well stated Ron.
---
It's funny until you see it in every comment thread about FNV. Then it gets boring

Bleached dog wood go to the Pioneer Scout Camp, look for the trees with leaves that are black and white

That is so sad...
---
Alexa play despacito

Did you have pacifist mode on?

Still funny to me.
---
Trying to find glowing resin, don‚Äôt judge me lol.
---
This is an invalid bs arguement. Are we supposed to know it's broken after a few hours,is that your point?
---
Laat time it only took me three months to get into shape because I was pretty relentless doing the home exercises as well as keeping every appointment. These last two surgeries were a lot bigger though.
---
If you're barely getting into it, sure. You'll probably get a a good solid week of content or much much more if you really get into something (lore seeking, collecting random stuff, discovering every location, having a solid build). I've been playing since the beta and I've only just now started taking a break to play Apex Legends. Don't feel pressured to play, and just keep it around if new content releases. Cheers.
---
Usually you‚Äôre right, but holy shit is it funny to basically see every post be complaints about this game.
---
Adding you in a few!
---
Because they know fuckwits will buy any old shit based on the brand, so half arse the games.
---
There's a questline called Tracking Unknowns, if I remember correctly, that reveals what happened to the sentient ghouls.
---
It would have to be the latter. In every sense. 
---
If Vault-Tec didn't have intelligence from the reality of what was happening outside the vault, there would be any number of plot holes.
---
They'd have to know what's happening outside the vault. And couldn't there be a chance it's not 25 years after, but many years later after that? If you recall, Vault-Tec kept you frozen for a couple hundred years in Fallout 4. 
---
In this fictional world that we are withholding disbelief, couldn't they have frozen people, then placed us in the simulation of the post-apocolyptic world they had been studying in order to prepare everyone?
---
I've seen it consistently (pre-patch at least) at both of the raiderbot vendors at The Top Of The World. I got mine from the railroad vendor but Resin inside the ski resort has it occasionally as well. 
---
That's a good news actually, soon enough the company(s) will to fold due to bad sales.
---
Best thing is they'll have to put those IPs on sale.
---
Yeah I keep hearing that, I was just hoping for more
---
They don't have to all be human. There could be like one or two ghouls too. I think it's crap that there aren't any non ferral ghouls.
---
So it might be fun without anyone to play with? Don‚Äôt have many (if any) gaming friends.
---
Earlier you whined how terrible everyone is got how they were treating you.  Boo hoo you.
---
But your the one who can‚Äôt handle that people like something you don‚Äôt. Because you think you opinion is the only right one.
---
Now you just wasted your time and life with someone that baited you and you fell for it do easy. 
---
And you want yo be considered smart and intelligent? 
---
Good luck.
---
There are no X01 plans for mods. Only place to get them is buy them from armory terminal in enclave bunker or through another player who bought them there. Scrapping PA does not yield mod knowledge 
---
Instigating is very good on a high damage weapon, like a gauss rifle, super sledge, or harpoon gun, as with the way armor is calculated you can instantly kill many weaker enemies. With my instigating death claw gauntlet, I can kill the bloated glowing ones at white springs in one power attack.
---
I was in a car accident. They went into the steering wheel. I've now had both wrists reconstructed and a couple of minor surgeries on top of that.
---
This is the content I keep playing for
---
I mean, technically, this is no secret. Fallout 76 purportedly was a joint effort from numerous studio hands within Bethesda. The documentary mentions this, and the plan was always after release, the rest of those studios would go onto working on other more prominent projects while the studio at Austin would continue working on the game.
---
You managed to get it at actual MSRP. I‚Äôm shocked
---
Youre still here crying for attention. Yes I did a mistake in Hasta so I will say it in french, bon d√©barras!
---
Enclave Event: A Real Blast by Bog Town has spawned all Snallygasters last 3 times I did it.
---
Fair enough. I can't say I don't get a kick out of checking out reddits for games that I've bailed on after bad decisions. A bit of a difference between lurking for shits and giggles and being condescending though.
---
&gt; We're seeing months of "work" go into changing the weight of bobby pins  to .001lbs... then back to .1lbs... then back to .001lbs. 
---
The  whole version merger kerfuffle that led to this shows that there was NO testing done before roll-out. This is something that should have been caught immediately upon logging into a test account. That to me is a pretty good indication that OP is right. I think Bethesda right now are trying to keep the game alive until the planned DLCs are released and private servers/mod support are out, while also putting as few resources as possible into maintenance.  Basically milk it for everything they can and then drop it. Its probably the most sensible thing to do financially. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Reminds me of a little MMO I used to play, Dofus - when you sign out you have the option to leave your character on the server in shop mode.
---
With the current track record of this game, I'd be afraid of people buying things I didn't want to sell ;)
---
How are you spending that much ammo to kill level 20 super mutants? My level 30 hunting rifle can 2 hit kill level 15 ones.
---
Ouch, sorry to hear that. Best of luck with your recovery man! 
---
If you are looking for a less mobility-intensive game to play, civilization 6 is releasing a big expansion on valentines day, it's turn based and only uses the mouse so it's a good game to kill time with if you're stuck at home and not very flexible.
---
I'm the same way. It's like Stockholm syndrome or something.
---
The devs are awesome, the ingame models, environments, weapons and characters are for the most part detailed and great looking, in most of Bethesdas games, plus the games run smooth most of the time in the engine. I'm still amazed at the detail on some of the models that appear on the loading screen one can turn around with the mouse.
---
I had three of them spawn over me last night, no chance of winning that one.....
---
Have you tried the 1/3 size walls under "defenses"? I use them on my deck and I think they look pretty good. 
---
Absolutely. I've played solo 98% of the time with the rest of the time occasionally helping random people, and trading with others on Reddit. 
---
That comment was put on a thread argument with someone calling me a hater 
---
I would love to see centaurs, and i hope a higher up in Bethesda sees this.
---
Awesome, thanks a lot! I might consider holding off a bit and consider opening it up and giving it a go. 
---
Yeah. Apparently there's a secret, in Fallout 4, that no one has discovered yet. I don't know what it is. But I bet it has to do with something like this
---
I like the game, there just isn't anything to do at endgame besides daily/weekly challenges for atom points. I hope they open the Vaults soon.
---
That, or double the area and budget for camps so that we can really go wild! 
---
Toxic Larry's Meat 'n Go always spawns 3, the lakebed near Hemlock Holes has a guaranteed Grafton Monster (also drops some acid) as well as a frequent spawn point for Snallygasters near the Vertibird.
---
Oh no shit really? Thanks for the update. 
---
But drop pipe rifles when killed.
---
Sooooo you put a 15$ bid on an item you didn't want or ever intend to buy? Darwinism at it's finest right here folks.
---
Not if I can sell for more. 
---
just make a foundation the entrance and store it and replace it going inside, then it's truly indestructible with no entrances
---
So now,in your view,I'm not only an idiot but a fuckwit for preordering a game from a company I've purchased from a dozen times without major disappointment?
---
Yeah,that seems like sounds reasoning...... Wait,no it doesn't.....
---
&gt;true Fallout fan
---
Some ignorant shit right there.
---
No problem, if you ever need to ask more questions it's probably better to ask it at r/fo76FilhtyCasuals for a less biased/intense answer. Enjoy your game.
---
Move your junk to your stash and try again - known bug.
---
It is super realistic! After the apocalypse I expect to spend a lot of time struggling to feed myself, stay safe from marauding bands of ... marauders (we call them griefers) .
---
Bethesda's servers should shit themselves if they tried to do two mods on power armor
---
Good luck with that, regardless of what everyone says on this sub, this game is getting trashed by game critics, youtubers, etc. You'll probably get 9 bucks off it.
---
I tried that. Then I tried restarting the game. Didnt work. 
---
I had to drop one of them and get my friend to repair it for me. The other wouldn't repair for either of us
---
That makes sense.  What I didn‚Äôt like was being actively attacked and then having to go completely motionless and defenseless for 20+ seconds digging through a laggy menu to switch a setting so I could fight back.
---
Do you remember where?
---
Btw,basing purchases off of a brand's reputation is generally how logical people procede....
---
&gt; Todd is in trouble with the numerous mistakes his company has made under his leadership. He destroyed the Mass effect franchise with Andromeda, and has FO on life support thanks to this mess.
---
Wtf lol. What does Bethesda have to do with EA and Bioware??!
---
I feel it's a lot less than it was a few months ago. I used to be able to server hop, and itd be a sure thing that I would rejoin a different server. The last few weeks I've found that when trying to server hop I'd be put back in the same server more often than a different one.
---
I think the thing that was most jarring for me was literally that power armour reveal. 
---
Pre release i was like ‚Äúwow, power armour is going to be rare as hell, you‚Äôre literally gonna have to keep your eyes on the dirt to find partially buried sets from pre war soldiers‚Äù
---
Then you get in game, my first player encounter is with a guy looting the mothman museum in full x01 with an atom store skin, when I‚Äôm level 5, and there‚Äôs a frame every 300 yards, and that‚Äôs pretty much the only way you ever find pa except one shoulder on a table outside thunder.
---
Bit of a letdown there.
---
Ah,ok.
---
I play mostly solo and have found about 200 hours worth of stuff to do.  It‚Äôs plenty fun for $15.
---
Its the people who spent $60+ and expected a flawless AAA game that have had a really negative experience.
---
Git gudder
---
Lmao!
---
Awesome post! Thanks for taking the time to share (:
---
Just a side note to your comment about super mutants suiciders, here's my head canon for why they exist: it's not that they're actively trying to kill themselves when they run at you with a mini-nuke, but their goal is to prove that they're the toughest among their species. Super mutants are always making comments about how they're the best and the strongest, so maybe there's this culture of thinking that only the best of the best can survive a mini-nuke. Maybe one mythical mutie actually *did* survive so that's been the ceiling to break ever since. 
---
TLDR; super mutants suiciders are just muties engaging in a dick measuring contest. The only kind they can have since they don't actually have any dicks.
---
This, and you are both fucking crazy. I love it!
---
Will try
---
&gt;  Todd is in trouble with the numerous mistakes his company has made under his leadership. He destroyed the Mass effect franchise with Andromeda, 
---
How was he able to do that? He don't even work for the same company. 
---
Great list, well said.
---
I‚Äôm sending that Radscorpion line to everyone I play 76 with.
---
I‚Äôm not worried, I see the price trending around 20 or so on eBay and a coworker of mine offered to buy it if I decide to sell. 
---
yes any animal can open any unlocked door. Which is why putting a level 0 lock on your camp door keeps them out. 
---
I got the power armor edition, and to be honest it was worth the amount of playtime I got plus a sweet helmet.
---
I bit the bullet and bought em. But regret it since they dont snap together properly.
---
There's a quest that explains what happened to the sentient ghouls and, sadly, it actually makes sense.
---
the one time I've had a bounty (picking a supply crate for a Miscellaneous quest "get the supply drop" hilariously). I server hopped twice while in Flatwoods, the second time I loaded in I had the wanted icon in the bottom of screen then -10 caps showed up on screen, I died and it said my bounty had been collected. did the server claim my bounty OP?
---
Well thank you for the insightful comment, unlike some of these other people.
---
Eh honestly I'd say give it a try if you don't like it you can still sell it. It's honestly not a bad game. I've been playing since the beta on ps4 and I've only disconnected a handful of times, and I've never had my game freeze. If you don't get a lot of bugs, or if bugs don't ruin your experience, you might just enjoy this game.
---
Take them OUT of stash and break them into their basic parts. Break anything bulked and have it on hand. Try again
---
It's in game.  Just called 308.
---
Sure sounds that way, but who knows with this frickin‚Äô game? With the loading delays maybe someone killed you before you fully loaded...
---
Beautiful! 
---
Full Reset
---
Another sad break up post...
---
Yeah I‚Äôve enjoyed the majority of Bethesda titles, I usually stay away from online play for the most part.
---
Gud
---
no like, it did the same animation that it does when you stumble into an area with old mobs spawned. you know how they just like snap in half and ragdoll/fall over themselves backwards? thats what it did. and it usually tells you who claimed the bounty, it just took my caps and sent me on my way 
---
In FO3 and New Vegas, you could find yourself in a situation where you have to fight two or more deathclaw's at once. Which can be scary considered how fast they were in those games. Where as in FO4, your best chance to find a good number of them was in the Glowing Sea and even then they were kinda spread out. Also, I feel like FO4, having access to Legendary weapons as well as power armor right off the bat made encounters easier.
---
Oh and make sure you have at least +1 to all parts the bare minimum is required 
---
Don't bother trying to farm that place, they've nerfed it to oblivion. 
---
Do ANY event on the map, no matter what event, no matter how far away, just join.
---
You won't be worse off for caps from fast travelling because each event rewards more caps than it takes to get there if you complete it. 
---
You'll see many many 3* Legends spawning and increase your chance of good loot. 
---
I just got a nice explosive .50cal from a Sgt. Gutsy event just outside Robco.
---
See Ya ricky rescue!
---
I like the area boss idea, but do they all need to be triggered with a nuke?  What about killing a certain number of creatures in an area triggers a boss.  You could have a meter to see how close an area was to triggering that would encourage others to come and then there could be cool down timer before it can be summoned again.
---
When I see someone in PA I don't think OP I think easy pickings.
---
The camp space allows for expansion. Eventually camps will be bigger
---
Gonna add to this that you gotta be ready to spend *quite* some time server hopping the enclave to get all the mods you want since it‚Äôs RNG
---
Never noticed tbh
---
:( that's no fun, sorry 
---
Nope
---
Awww did it hurt your feelings?
---
That sounds like the most fun I haven't had in this game in weeks. 
---
I also like it when people relentless attack my base, so... I might not be the norm.
---
I want Fallout! Nothing says fallout like an overpowered stalker...
---
I paid 300 and got a FO76 douchebag and a kick to the nuts
---
You mean...Fallout 4...go play it
---
I've played solo from the start, level 80 and I've only added a single person to my friends list. It's not that I don't find people to play with, it's just that I get disconnected from the server before I can even remember their name.
---
yeah, I had it with the others too, but i switched to the minimal looking one. It stays in place now. Now I wish I hadn't bothered spending points to get the atomic shop one
---
I'll try it again later tonight when I get back on, but I generally have multiple bulk of repair parts and at least a few dozen of each loose when I repair my gear at the end of each session. Just was frustrating as hell. Have an insane lever action that does a lot extra to robots, plus extra armor penetration, and its clutch sometimes in watoga. 
---
Had to break away and recard for my mele gear. 
---
Is this the new reply stupid people use because they can‚Äôt actually come up with something of their own? Lol
---
&gt; Though I think the reason for microtransactions, DLC sales and other stuff, is to help offset the continuing budgetary needs that accompany an online-only game. You know, servers and stability, continued development, new content.
---
Oh yes, I'm sure all those juicy microtransactions and/or DLC content that all these other businesses seem to be trending towards is all for the sake of barely scraping enough green from the bottom of the dev blood, sweat, and tears distiller to cover operating costs I'm sure.
---
Really? Come on thats an easy question. by selling the game for $60 dollars, or make it free to play with micro, not both. Seriously, there are MMOs that survive off of base price models and free to play models.
---
At this point, Atomic shop is the only thing funding the bandwidth and server uptime. Typically you would expect new sales to trickle down over the course of a year, not a few months. I doubt they are breaking even on upkeep and uptime. 
---
Darn right they have pulled resources from the game. Gotta stop the bleeding somewhere.
---
So, either they have pulled the team from the patches to rework FO76 into a marketable product, Like what happened with Final Fantasy Online for example, or the team has been moved to speed up another title that was already in the pipeline.
---
Keep defending a company that continues to screw over its loyal fan base. A couple thousand loyal fans wont be enough to prop the company up in the end.
---
PC player with a PS4 collector's edition because Bethesda limited releases are such a clusterfuck.
---
You either had pacifist mode on or you had a workshop that got conquered. I heard about an exploit if a group of friends hunt you down while one of them captures your workshop you cannot damage his friends but they can damage you. I only heard this once so i can't validate it.
---
Yup not worth it sometimes. Most of the popular ones like jetpack and calibrated shocks hardly ever show up. I got lucky with the jetpack but had to outsource the shocks after hopping for a few days
---
I learned the hard way with mole rats. Set up a camp right on top of the spawn point.  Kept getting in till I locked the door. Since then not had one get in unless I forgot to close the door. 
---
Check out /r/SkyrimTogether ...it's pretty much what you're describing with Skyrim (on pc)
---
Lol love this post
---
That‚Äôs a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù (lol)
---
When being keylocked during server interuptions, could our characters not be taken out of sneak each time? Very frustrating when you are locked out with enemies on alert.

I m still looking for my 2nd shocks... at this point i can only get going. There s no way i m gonna buy it from someone else or wait till it‚Äôs fixed and sold at a very high price. I gotta find it before.

Make a giant Radscorpion boss and name him Otis. üëå

just in real life. cats r cancer.
---
Have you looked closely at the dart board? 20 numbers and only 18 pizza slices.  Its tough to just hit a 6 now. Need triple 2 or a double 3.
---
&gt;I miss Super Mutant Behemoths
---
they r in the game...
---
If you get pharma farms, you will get crazy amounts of all drugs, including stim packs and radaway.
---
Well she died in 5he air pretty high above us so?
---
We have a community manager but she's really all but useless.
---
Will I be needing a Holy Mini Nuke of Antirad?
---
I rarely do now, but still check the forums to see if something epic has changed. I managed to grind through 332 levels so I got my money's worth.  Glad they nerfed some things as it broke my addiction to the game. 
---
Time is a flat circle.
---
Directly under her. I've seen it in trees, and seen it in the fence around v9, but it's there.
---
i have a lvl 21 two star legenadary deathclaw lapdog. my base on the hills over whitespring and 2-3 lvl 50-80 schorcbeast spawn there daily. when they land my dog kill them really fast.
---
Clearly im bitching about getting screwed? What are you unable to comptehend?
---
Feel the same way. refund my atoms please 
---
I found one just south of Site Bravo.
---
Even if they did sell 5 million copies (unlikely based on actual sources), the game was heavily discounted by the end of the first week!  Their actual sales revenue (vs. their forecasted) will be pretty poor. 
---
Ski mask and a BB gun.....
---
Damn, that had to be it.  Thanks for saving my day. 
---
Can be leftovers from a nuke that has ended.
---
Always frustrates me especially with the barn set. 
---
We‚Äôre all vault stock geniuses who can turn melted spanner‚Äôs, dog bowls and beer bottles into state of the art pre war laser rifles. 
---
But can we make a window with intact glass? 
---
Not on your life. 
---
Yeah.  Top of thr world had rad berries all around it earlier today and the purple sap.
---
Cdkeys 10 bucks.
---
So why didn't they do that during their BETA?
---
What they are doing now, is a classic PR move. They are presenting something to occupy the community's time. By asking us to reiterate the problems, it keeps us busy and resets the clock to that point as far expectations for fixes go. They know damn well what people want, and what the problems are. They want us to focus on putting all of the rage on one place so it won't seem as wide spread.
---
It's all masturbatory and arbitrary. If they cared even the least bit, they would have done all of this during the beta test.
---
Being in pacifist wouldn't have stopped the guy. You sound like a griefer yourself mister! 
---
Thanks Bethesda
---
Roaming around Whitesprings entrances where the bots guard, occasionally 3 or so of them will spawn at once, you just gotta beat out the bots to get tags on em.
---
Gud luck
---
Wild boars, the only naturally occurring animal where I live that I'm actually scared of. 
---
All other wild animals around here, such as lynx, elk and badgers are more likely to take off before you even know they are near you, but wild boars are more likely to go "Human? Imma *fight* you!" 
---
I know, that was the most upsetting. The brick set has glass, but I dont like the interior walls of the brick.
---
 And thanks!
---
I apologise for nothing! NCR forever!
---
I have had no negative experiences. I have had a few people attack me once in awhile but With slap damage they couldn‚Äôt really kill. They either get ignored or I invite them to a match of naked fisticuffs. 
---
See I use the brick set. 
---
And I thought it had glass too. 
---
Except on closer inspection, as far as I can see, we have foregone glass in favour of just having holes.
---
" **Why does Assault Rifle even exist!** " 
---
to get 200 caps limit fast when u sale them to vendor.
---
I just pretend it is just really clear glass
---
I agree I spend a lot of time thinking about this. I think the game would be good again if you guys brought back two shot explosive to their original form buffed other weapons. It's become a pointless grind. Also the scorchbeast queen wouldn't drop any weapons for the many times I did it.if I did get something from the scorchbeast queen it was pointless. I think there should be different nuke zones with different monsters that are high-level like the scorchbeast queen. I think there should be guns that are higher than level 50. I also think if you guys want to balance PVP don't wreck PVE for it make cards be innovative. Bring back to shot explosives for the community and the game to survive. please do it now because of their games are coming out..
---
Can‚Äôt we get a little more out of camps. Not asking for a lot but it would be nice to be able to build more than a small room and four turrets.
---
Haven‚Äôt so far in  320+ hours
---
Very nice, I was worried it was going to be in the middle of the road which annoys me when people do that, but this is cool.
---
First off, *I‚Äôm in college.* I do not have $530 to drop on a PC, especially when I‚Äôm extremely happy with my thousand dollar Macbook. Second, I already don‚Äôt play with my friends online: most of them either don‚Äôt play games or have Xbox‚Äôs, and I don‚Äôt care because I prefer single player. Third, I will never switch to PC as I hate Windows: Windows machines are incredibly prone to viruses and wear out extremely quickly, while my 4 year old Mac still runs as well as the day I bought it and has never gotten a virus. So, no. I‚Äôm not a Playstation fanboy, I just prefer gaming on a console so I can sit on my couch and play it on a big screen. Yes, I could wire my computer to my TV but there‚Äôs no room. Again, you need to work on your empathy instead of pushing your preferred console as a scorched-earth solution. 
---
Counter argument for stopgaps:
---
All automatics got a 20% damage buff as a stop gap early into the game. 
---
It didn‚Äôt fix the minigun or the lmg and bugged the Gatling gun which probably didn‚Äôt need a buff ‚Äî but it shows they are perfectly fine e with stopgaps. 
---
NOOOOO, FFS don't do it!
---
Same, same.   P.s., have an upvote.
---
Fair counter...   
---
  
---
And I did list it as a stop gap in my bug submission, who knows, maybe they will..
---
Not yet give it a month or to, saying that i got 500+ hours in its fun but i would wait a little
---
This is interesting and awesome! ... wouldn't it be sweet to form a research group to explore things like this in game.. ü§î
---
No, I didnt even know that there was a pacifist mode. So is this another bug?
---
I think it was a new but okay direction to have full-time power armor builds.  
---
The problem was that normal armor is not usable in nuked zones.  So it‚Äôs power armor, or the hazmat suit you got in one of the first quest lines....
---
Combined with stealth not being reliable (at least for me) in populated or nuked areas, and it meant PA or one-punch were the only effective options 
---
If you are looking for a game like the others, with real character choices and awesome RPG experience, gripping story, then look elsewhere. But if you want to wander around a new wasteland with better game mechanics, beautiful lighting and most importantly with friends then totally get it. I love 76 but I feel like it's not really a fallout game
---
Care to elaborate? 
---
I have a problem with civ games. And that problem is once I start playing, I don't stop for about 48 hours.
---
Would I be waiting for a price drop or some sort of patch/update? 
---
100%  I'm looking at her now.  Corpse is named Rosalynn Jeffries and she has 2 Frag Grenades funny enough.  Rebar sticking through her gut.
---
It is one of the better Fallout games for different reasons. It is highly enjoyable. If you are a fan that likes the Fallout lore then you will enjoy this game. It definitely needs some work but more than worth the $30-$40 cost
---
I've been searching for a metal Picnic table since last month
---
You think this team can pull off a complicated system like that and not break the game even more?
---
I probably wouldn't use them, I mostly want them as "collectibles", so it's not worth the hassle to do that. I do wish you could get the fabricator to, well, fabricate new ones though. I'd even get the ingredients again. 
---
The birds are government surveillance equipment!
---
Unfortunately this seems to be the response to the PvP elements of workshops, more so how it's way to unfair and greifers use it to hunt and kill people. They don't even to have to claim it to kill you, just attempt to claim it.
---
Every time I play I am absolutely determined to complete some quests. End up  coming across some new structure or town along the way and I end up spending and hour searching for junk.
---
I was doing uranium fever and a guy using tse pre nerf one shot the legendaries.
---
That's my horror story
---
If you just want a new and beautiful map to explore then yes but this game needs a ton of work. I would suggest at least waiting until a good sale
---
I don't ask people if they want their bounty removed, I just remove it. If it's just 5-10 caps, I leave their junk for them to reclaim. 
---
Complaint and bashing faults in the game is not against any rule on this sub. If you are sensitive and can't browse here without being gotten to then piss off and go play your game. I probably have more hours in this game than you do and honestly you people constantly whinging like someone kicked your dog annoy me far more than anyone else.
---
Do it, quit being a bitch. 
---
If you enjoy the fallouts for the same reason I do (exploring a new map, running around finding hidden stuff) you‚Äôll get your moneys worth 
---
What‚Äôs your gamertag?
---
I don't want to come across as dismissive, but like, how?
---
Sounds awesome. Would love to try it. Just a few questions.
---
Platform?
---
Are vendors allowed?
---
PvP?
---
Are we allwed to use pre stored junk/aid?
---
Will opposing teams be in come with each other?
---
Are "bases" pre assigned or first come first serve?
---
What happens if a team loses their base due to someone else (either playing or not playing) taking over the woekshop?
---
Definitely! There's a lot of stuff to read on the terminals... I admit I don't read them like I should! =]
---
You cant be on a fallout sub and say that and not elaborate 
---
Wow you made it sound like I was contemplating suicide.
---
Once whilst exploring the intelligence agency building east of the white spring bunker, me and a friend ran into a group of three players all in full excavator armour all with all rise just camping out the building. They proceeded to dive infront of every shot we took in an attempt to engage pvp. All the while spamming melee into our backs. So we decide we will just come back later when these asshats are gone. There are other buildings to explore.
---
Unhappy with this the asshats follow us outside the building. Then continue to follow us across about a mile of terrain, all the white continuing their amateur chiropractic work. So we fast travel to base, may as well ditch these idiots and dump some scrap. Ten minutes later all three turn up at our base, and begin trying to destroy it. We server hop before they destroy so much as a fence. 
---
Not quite the same, and infact you could state it‚Äôs ‚Äúpart of the games intended pvp‚Äù but I once got a bounty for lockpocking an empty world container that I didn‚Äôt realise was part of a captured workshop, earning myself a 5cap bounty. 
---
When I was level 16.
---
A level 115 teleported straight to me minutes later and one shotted me in the back with quelle surprise, all rise, wearing full excavator.
---
Gotta get that cheevo.
---
Guess you just are not up to the challenge.
---
Amen brother the whining I‚Äôm this game is crazy!
---
ahahah thank you! It probably is just a case of seeing too much, but it's fun anyway! =]
---
Toit
---
Jump! Jump! Jump! 
---
Ooh, gotcha. Yeah we definitely need those 
---
I hope so! =]] 
---
I'd actually been wondering about the head I saw in the Lucky Hole Mine.. this is some great research, and I love when folks are interested in bits of lore like this too :)
---
Haha, yeah that's a real problem for sure.
---
&gt; TSEs where a crutch for people who didn't feel like actually learning how to set up a build and instead focused on one thing. 
---
That argument is a crutch for someone who doesn't understand that the difference between lucking out and just having your squad of optimally geared players show up for SBQ and having basically the entire server show up can mean beating SBQ in no time flat or it being mathematically impossible, i.e. doing ideal DPS values at 100% accuracy, for you to make a difference even with a TSE if you got unlucky and most players on that server are dead weight underleveled players that shouldn't even be allowed to join in on the event if all they can possibly do is hope the no rad damage bug kicks in while they watch other people actually kill the things‚Äìor even just players that don't want to expend ammo (imagine that‚Äìan endgame boss so unrewarding people would rather not even help than use ammo to do so) or simply just appropriately leveled but are under-geared with bad perk loadouts and $5 says they don't even have tenderizer to at least contribute more damage by helping the players actually doing that thing to it.
---
&gt;If you dont think they where broken before then tell me how being able to snipe enemies with a tse pump made since?
---
Because this is an RPG and god forbid people take some of the most sought after end game loot to make trash mobs actually feel true to their name. What's next? Will this game actually have something reminiscent of MMOs (as some people like to claim this to be) and have Big Anime Swords of Compensating for Something added so melee characters can also look just as truly ridiculous as they are strong?
---
Yes, that is me to a tee.
---
Thanks! Yes, and tell us if you find anything! =]]]
---
omg Bethesda plz
---
Just make all food in the stash box unspoilable or take much longer to spoil. We don‚Äôt need an actual fridge.
---
Citation needed. All I see is a game that was slammed by critics and audiences alike for being objectively broken. 
---
Put a headset on and go talk to people. Always works for me (PS4).
---
This id not an airplane, no reason to announce your departure
---
Sell? Good luck.

u/lonevaultwanderer u/ladydevann
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse: a camp in the middle of the road, or a floating monstrosity. 
---
Done. 
---
Game store, I have a coupon to get an extra $15 on a trade in over $10, and this shit is somehow worth $10 trade
---
I will try that! Thanks for the tip!
---
No.
---
Oh, man, now you're teasing! My impression is that those "alcoves" will be part of a future quest. Hopefully it will be something really crazy, like opening portals to another dimension! =]
---
F‚Äôn Monster....
---
Better do it quick cause I seen it being given away. 
---
They did. How ever the beta was limited. A week or two long event that only took into account people who preordered the game. Pre orders are always a tiny size of the population. 
---
&gt; What they are doing now, is a classic PR move.
---
Based on...?
---
&gt; They are presenting something to occupy the community's time. By asking us to reiterate the problems, it keeps us busy and resets the clock to that point as far expectations for fixes go.
---
Yes because trying to find in the ocean of feed back the specifics to build a plan for specifics is a bad thing.  When players give feed back they will complain about one or two to a dozen different points. This makes getting specifics for a specific issue difficult because they have to read though entire posts to reach the couple of lines they are interested in. Asking questions for specific problems means the replies will only be about the subject they want to build feed back on. 
---
Also way to assume everyone who plays this game is a fucking moron.  I'll have to screen cap this so next time I feel like calling someone a moron on this sub reddit I can just point to you.
---
&gt; It's all masturbatory and arbitrary.
---
Based on your years working in the support department of a video game company?
---
&gt; If they cared even the least bit, they would have done all of this during the beta test
---
Or based on assumptions from terms that you don't understand. Or more specifically have been abused by companies to hell and back so much since early release became popular on steam so that their original meaning has been lost.  Pretty sure Fortnite still calls it self in beta and RDR2 Online has been in beta for what 4 months at this point?
---
LOL
---
It is a good game.  It is not perfect, but is it still very worthwhile. 
---
Well, enjoy your shit games then. I'm not fucking arsed haha.
---
I bought another account just so I can start keeping gear there. Maybe this is thier tactic to up their sales numbers. Hahaha....sob.  But in any case I have three characters named "Armor", "Weapons", and "Junk".  My camps are right by some world containers with 0 weight capacity for infinite loading of gear between characters. Probably still gonna run out of room in a month.
---
I bet I‚Äôd never lose an Atom Store purchase. Ever. 
---
It seems like it resets at midnight. Now if that is east cost time or west cost time I don't know. 
---
It is one of my top favorite fallout games. I would say there is almost no story lol which sucks. But by far my favorite crafting, exploring, character creation experience so far. Playing with others and the online trading system is so much fun and unique. 
---
what console?
---
I‚Äôve been ill for the last month or so, so 76 has been a welcome distraction. 
---
Basically 76 is best enjoyed either with friends who enjoy the slow pace of exploration, or solo.
---
 If you take the time to read the notes, listen to the holotapes, and not necessarily run from mission to mission, but let yourself explore, it can be a worthwhile investment of time. 
---
But it is a very lonely game.  The only interaction you tend to get with players is a thumbs up, or in my experience defaulting to the eu servers, a Frenchman with area voice chat left on shouting at his mom whilst crouching in a bush. 
---
And npc‚Äôs are near to non existent. 
---
Don‚Äôt expect any meaningful relationship development with any npc‚Äôs. It won‚Äôt happen.
---
If you‚Äôre happy with your own company and enjoy walking simulators and at times truly beautiful backdrops then 76 will give you enjoyment.
---
If you are expecting an mmo, or a deep story driven experience like prior fallout games, you‚Äôll probably be left feeling a little flat.
---
What is more stranger and mysterious than a teleporting immortal in their underroos? 
---
&gt; But the pvp mode is easier to pump out
---
A pong mini-game app on the vault boy on top of the other ones would be even easier and at least just as good as that hastily thrown together mess on a game that clearly never considered such a mode as anything more than another tick on the back of the box.
---
This was the funiest thing I have read all day. Bravo, sir.
---
I have to say that I completely disagree with just about everything, but respect for the great formatting and useful CONSTRUCTIVE feedback. Love seeing posts like this. 
---
&gt;**except BOS which we do not speak of.**
---
Too late
---
As I said the problem is with the queen not the tse weapons. There nerf was necessary whether people want to admit it or not.
---
Which is worse. Killing and eating a cat or killing and eating a human?
---
So, as a native West Virginian, born and raised...I agree with the Black Beat analogy lol I‚Äôve ran into Black Bear hunting and they do run away ‚Äúfarting‚Äù. I wish they would‚Äôve replaced the wolves with mutated coyotes...in WV, Coyotes are rampant and nasty by themselves, let alone in packs....something that would‚Äôve been new and unique for 76 that would‚Äôve went with the WV theme would‚Äôve been an overgrown Copperhead or Timber RattleSnake, talk about a reason to keep your ass out of the Mire...there it is 
---
Good idea... but I gotta tell you... I didn't know there were mothman eggs! ahhah
---
Well...I‚Äôm assuming your referring to a Scorched Human, so either way...def human lol 
---
I would like to add one thing.
---
Armor of enemies in general is way to homogenous.
---
The armor system of this game is such that high health low armor enemies are vulnerable to low burst, high dps weapons, and enemies with high armor are vulnerable to high burst low dps weapons, but even the least armored enemy has a lot of armor, scorched are rolling around with 100 armor, and are the least armored enemy in the game, with enemies averaging 175 armor. This is why heavy weapons are terrible, if there was even one enemy with 5 times more health and 0 armor then they would have something to do, as they have good paper dps, but even just 20 armor cuts their damage significantly, while to cut a super sledge or other "OP melee" takes hundreds of armor, and giving enemies so much armor only serves to make them more capable compared to other weapons.
---
Enemies with 0 armor need to exist at every level, that is how the armor system is designed, but there are no such enemies.
---
And a skylight window in the slanted roof.
---
If you're on xbox I'll gladly pop in and build you the rest of the instruments if you need them.

---
Fallout Brotherhood of Steel: The Quickining
---
The game does have some problems but as an old Fallout fan it's not that bad. Lot's of whining about it. I prefer to give them a chance to work those problems out. It is a little different from previous Fallout games so be ready to adapt.
---
If ur a fan of the series how come u don‚Äôt have it.  I wouldn‚Äôt care what others say if I‚Äôm a fan.
---
Will do!! Keep up the good work
---
Pretty sure you can kill and eat human players (PvP)...
---
The heads in Lucky Hole Mine and the Dunwich Borers are the most interesting thing to me. I think something will be revealed in F76. =]
---
Lol I thought the cannibal perk was only for enemies...either way, I haven‚Äôt changed my mind 
---
Just get in a group and share rank one rad sponge. Get ghoulish for maximum effect.
---
You have to visit the Lucky Hole Mine at least once... and search every nook and cranny of the narrow corridor! =]
---
Give me your shit 
---
Ignore all the bitch made crybabies on here and try it out, form your own opinion please. I‚Äôve got over 300+ hours of fun out of the game and counting, well worth my $60 on Reclamation Day
---
Thank you!
---
Get really really lucky defending a workshop
---
For 20 maybe but don‚Äôt spend more ain‚Äôt worth it, i play it yes but a really non passionate effort  of a video game design ( technically) because tbh game looks cute sometimes 
---
Got it. I'll spread the word that "Mattbp237" would rather kill and eat humans then kill and eat cats ;-)
---
They hardly ever deviate much from the usual canned phrases and pleasantries so that makes it pretty clear indicator that how much they do or don't know doesn't even matter since they could kiss their ass goodbye if they ever did decide to turn super woke community manager version of Morpheus on us and let us in on any one of Bethesda's dark and terrible(...-y lazy) secrets.
---
Im on PC sadly. Thanks though!

I want to share the testimony of a pro hacker in town for everyone that requires the service of a C|EH his contact is [b l a c k h a t l o r d (at) p r o t o n m a i l (dot) c o m](mailto:blackhatlord@protonmail.com). He has proved his genuine and honesty to me over the course of handling many hacking job for me so I urge anyone that want the service of a pro hacker that will give values for money to contact this guy. He's fast and reliable once deal you'll testify as well..
---
Lmao it is what it is....I don‚Äôt PvP but I‚Äôd go full potato if I witnessed another dweller shotgunning those cute little kitties 
---
If your wife is noticing your upset its affecting your marriage. 
---
Fo76 is just a game, it's not worth damaging your marriage.
---
Yes. 
---
If you get beamed up, you have to escape from inside.
---
You've probably gotten 100hrs at this point. There's the vault DLC within the next few months, and the PvP server soon. Just keep it, and you'll be able to get all the DLC free. 
---
Keep coming back
---
My first camp during beta was one that goes over a road, like an upside down U, Had a stash and crafting tables for people to use underneath it.
---
Na, I‚Äôm selling
---
I was very skeptical initially, similar situation to OP. In the end I got it, have played the hell out of it and I‚Äôm enjoying it for what it is. It‚Äôs different than the previous titles, but still very good. 
---
Yes, it has bugs upon bugs, but it gets a lot more right than it gets wrong. 
---
The multiple reports of people's friends lists going totally dark says otherwise.
---
Happysunflow3r on xbox.

Doing my Enclave imepression and taking every workshop I can find. Powerplants first.

My enclave keeps it‚Äôs troops well stocked, plenty of stims/ammo to share.

If you‚Äôd like to join up, send me a message saying you‚Äôre from reddit.
---
I believe the price has dropped. I like it even with bugs and lots of hate surrounding it. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but for me, it's a new fallout in a new setting with new adventures and the ability to play with or against other players. I really enjoy it and think if you love fallout and understand that it does have some bugs, you'll love it too
---
That is really great feedback for our current discussions on improving experiences with creatures in the game. I'll share your thread with the dev team. Thank you mate!
---
His would utterly destroy the game but I wish it could happen, it sounds awesome!

It's our state fossil.

Lol yea took me 50 times to get the paint took my buddy about 15 times its   random

March 5th is Fasnacht day. There will probably be a live event for it that will let you get the masks.
---
ahahah! Actually, me too. It's tradition. =\]
---
I like the idea. Those APNPCs should be made easily recognizable as such, though, otherwise it would create *some* confusion. And some sort of sanity check should be in place, what you don't want is 10 NPC traders clustering up around Whitesprings, with their pack bahmin all over the place and on the roofs (like back in Sanctuary). :-)
---
Oh, and btw:
---
&gt;-APC's will not show up on the map. They would function like Graham, travelling a set path that meanders through the world.
---
To the best of my knowledge, this is a common misconception. Grahm is a random encounter that can spawn all over the map, but he will only follow a path if you decide to follow him around. Otherwise, he will just despawn sooner or later.
---
You can jump through the large window as well (in case of emergency)
---
A lvl 15 thinks he can get on the bitch bandwagon 
---
Lol! You literally just to use that as a proof! It‚Äôs not proof. Oh  someone said something on the internet so it must be true! 
---
So glad I bought this game with Xbox reward points...They almost got me.
---
You know how I feel? 
---
How shall I phrase it... let me see... oh yes, here it is: 
---
You people constantly WHINING like someone kicked your dog annoy me far more than anything else in the game.
---
How does that irony taste? Now go away. xD
---
Cripple could be a stacking effect. 
---
A guy had yesterday a 10 cap bounty I killed him and took his stuff and regretted afterwards because I was overecumbured and wasn‚Äôt able to fast travel ( he had over 800 steel) amongs 200 lbs of junk silver gold I sold it later on with a friend he got around 800 caps for the haul
---
This is definitely a big QOL suggestion that I know the team is aware of, but I do want to share your thread with them as well. I personally like the idea of requiring a power source for the fridge/cooler! 
---
So I shouldn't get discouraged with the water/ammo sofar? Should I be server hopping between turn ins? 
---
what level are you? i generally see players lvl 40+
---
What level are you?
---
Tell me how my comment makes me a griefer please? The game allows pvp and it makes me laugh when people come here to cry about it.
---
I totally get it was an asshole move for a lvl +100 to harass a lvl 15 but the guy could have just hopped server instead of crying on Reddit like a little girl.
---
And I repeat, he could have just block the other guy and put himself on pacifist mode but he prefferef to come cry here.
---
I am waiting for his I quit post next.
---
Yeah, except he's arguing with the OP directly, and it's a real dick move to tell somebody how they would behave with no evidence to back that up
---
Please God no spiders
---
That's a good point. I always wondered where the SB appears from. We should coordinate with someone doing the quest to see what happen! 
---
But still, we should run like it‚Äôs Godzilla!
---
Dont ask us to give you reasons not to when you clearly made your decision.
---
Fishing for attention much?
---
If you guys can‚Äôt handle the game just quit.
---
I suggest you invest in 'good with salt' if you are carrying that much raw flux. It spoils too fast
---
Games are not jobs, I work with complex stuff all day at work. It doesn't mean I want to play spreadsheets after work.
---
Woah dude, I was joking, lighten up. 
---
From what I understand he can still smash his camp to bits even though he is in pacifist. Maybe he wouldn't have been killed as often. Who knows. 
---
are u selling? it resets after 20 hours at the time you first sell to them.
---
&gt;  Todd is in trouble with the numerous mistakes his company has made under his leadership. He destroyed the Mass effect franchise with Andromeda
---
How clueless are the people in this sub really?
---
Feel like this guy is smoking something dank thinking Todd can control Bioware to sink Andromeda lol.
---
AFAIK it was designed to be huge and heavy so that power-armored soldiers could wield it, so it really should be something like the 'heavy machine gun' or something and rebalanced accordingly.
---
HAHA I was waiting for something to jump out and attack you or something
---
Todd Howard confirmed master infiltrator
---
They killed all the fun weapons from past games :( railway rifle benefits from no perks, shishkebab‚Äôs damage got porked, alien blaster is a joke...
---
Alien blaster bugs me the most. It was THE ultimate weapon in 3/NV. I made all my decisions in 3 based on getting more ammo (nuking the citadel was so worth it). Now? Total meh... what happened 
---
buy it for $10 used
---
I like that your solution to people playing the game correctly is to exploit 
---
I honestly want to abandon ship. I got the game for free ( thanks to the switching primary console thing ) so I didn‚Äôt lose any money. 
---
I like the game. I like the building aspect. Saw a few videos on how to do a round fort house. 
---
I knew TSE were going to get nerfed. So no biggie there. I played WoW since Vanilla and used to being bent over a barrel.
---
I really seems that Bethesda has relied on modders to fix everything for them, from the letters people get for them to explain how they did it and everything. 
---
It seems what was acceptable in Single Player isn‚Äôt acceptable in Multiplayer, and Bethesda can‚Äôt seem to understand that it seems. 
---
Hell even Electronic Arts boiler plate, pride accomplishment comments have more meaning then what Bethesda says. 
---
I mean I really like the game but it‚Äôs in a very bad place atm. NMS was the same way. Until recently a loud pop happen and now it‚Äôs getting improved. 
---
It seems like Bethesda doesn‚Äôt truly listen. They hear but not listen. I have read many things on how to improve the game. Hell even some modders were even giving them advice. And Bethesda was like ‚ÄúOkay. Will pass that along to nobody and hope for the best.‚Äù 
---
And it makes me worried for the future of Bethesda games. Is Elder Scrolls VI and Star Field going to be just a polished turd? 
---
I really want to delete FO76 from my console but at the same time I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm bitching and sad at the same time. It feels like the crew is trying to save a sinking ship with only prayers and thoughts. 
---
It's also so your carry weight is less. 
---
Something is definitely happening. Maybe folks are just waiting for the next content phase, I don't know. I have a large list of traders I regularly used in the past and many of them have gone dark. Also many of the large scale traders on the various discord channels have also gone dark. It seems to have coincided with the 1500lb carry limit and/or the ban wave. So I'm not certain which of these is the larger factor but it definitely seems to have impacted player population.
---
Because in real life, no dog or cat has ever figured out how to open a gate?
---
I crafted what I could and sold the inert flux....
---
Steven King approves of this story.
---
Like I said, you're not interested in a real system and if you cared about empathy you wouldn't support child labor by buying a macbook but whatever. Fun fact don't go to shady sites don't get a virus I don't run antivirus software because well, I don't need to. Have fun with your overpriced MacBook as I can see you're not good with making decisions. Hopefully college will teach you better.
---
That's a lie, if you look closely it really doesn't. At least for most of them 
---
Yes, a poll which is months overdue if they were genuinely interested in seeing problems resolved. There's no reason why a poll couldn't have been in place on January 1st
---
Oof.
---
I‚Äôve been on since right after the beta - just haven‚Äôt played much.
---
This is about logic, friend. I just crafted ammo 10 times and didn‚Äôt get banned. I suspect pretty much everybody who plays does that every day. These results you‚Äôre talking about aren‚Äôt reproducible and make no sense. 
---
FYI...slap damage applies regardless of whether or not you are Pacifist mode.
---
Can't move closer at the moment, sadly. The minimum distance you can build to another camp is something like 5x camp bubbles away
---
Well if they don‚Äôt have a log of what happened or what was lost then it is unrecoverable because they don‚Äôt know exactly what was lost. Seeing as it disappeared from your stash then I doubt they have a log of the items that disappeared. 
---
Yeah i agree with all that. Free is great. That said, yes i do feel like its a full game. Long story, tons of exploring, feeling of moving from a camp on the side of the road to a custom home. I feel goof about it. It even has a final boss (as anticlimactic as she is).
---
That said i do feel like it only reaches that margin by the slimmest of measures. Its "finished" but not really because they plan on expanding it.
---
The bugs never interrupted my gameplay truly and i love the finished product. Part of the problem with this game is the lack of finality in it. We don't feel like we saved the world, because we didn't. The world is till fucked, everyone is dead or dying and we only solved 1 problem. There are no cutscenes too which sucks.
---
Because they were polling information about events. One set of data at a time. 
---
And by ‚Äúthat much‚Äù it must be less than 5 hrs to be at lvl 15....all I‚Äôm saying is, put down the koolaid and form your own opinions. Oof is right.
---
Already addressed this.
---
Because nobodies gonna buy it
---
24 hrs from the first trade you do with them on a reset I believe. 
---
I don‚Äôt know for certain but I normally do my vendor run after work between 7-8 and occasionally I‚Äôll buy up a partial amount of caps from either the watoga or white spring vendor, farm legendaries and sell those for the remaining caps and they‚Äôve reset at about the same time as the vendors I get all 200 from at once. 
---
Like I get 100 caps at 7pm then get the other 100 around 9 or so and it‚Äôs back at 200 the next day around 7
---
Good Luck playing an anazing Series, just stay clear of this one. 
---
That's the bs
---
I am just tired of all the complaining, people sound like crying babies, it‚Äôs insane, I get it‚Äôs not the best Fallout, far from it. But it‚Äôs still fun to some extend. It‚Äôs a game with pvp aspect. Some like to play predator from what I understand, the game allows it, if they don‚Äôt like that aspect, well then they can just stop playing, with the mandatory crying reddit post of course
---
I formed my own opinions a long time ago, I like fallout 76, it‚Äôs just a little... special.
---
Just one time in 6 weeks, one group of 3.
---
A couple weeks ago I found a lovely 3 story enclosed camp with a decon shower (costs 1 of each flux to repair) and everything.
---
As I was walking away, another player passed me walking towards it. They shot the ground a couple times to show off that they had an exploding shotgun. Then they went on blasting away the camp. 
---
I didn't stick around to watch, but I could see their bounty go up to 4 digits on the map, just from one camp, and a couple more dots showed up and accumulated bounties as well. Then their bounties all went away. They must have killed each other so no one else could claim it.
---
I rechecked the map periodically and saw the pattern repeat itself in a few other locations (camp after camp), and eventually my own camp while I was busy with uranium fever. Each time they erased their own bounties. It was just pointless.
---
They're the only players I've blocked so far, but it's caused me to check the map more often to search for others like them.
---
I think it's a fallout game. The plot requires you to search it out, but it's satisfying. Launching nukes is awesome, and assuming a player base exists, will have new content for a decade. There are several very funny and clever quests, but I stress you have to put in the work. There's little no player choice in quests, I say little because if you wander around ignoring the main story, it forces itself on you by lieu of how society died. 
---
Take it slowly though. If you rush through the main quest to launch a nuke, you'll miss most of the finer details, and enjoy it less.

I just tested this; doesn't become permanent; I took 1 point in the card, killed 6 enemies, had +36%, removed the perk card, damage went down to +1% and then disappeared after 30s.

I came across a circle of dead brahin in the road approaching Summerville, figured it was the Flatwoods monster but maybe it's that

Chances are someone dropped all junk legendary items in some container and that super mutant picked it up
---
Honestly we should all be ready for some news regrading Bethesda stopping development on this game. I‚Äôve seen and been part of a game that failed. Honestly I remember playing Paragon which was a moba that epic games had before fortnite at the end of its life Epic games promised many things and asked the community here on reddit for suggestions and it blindly gave it to them but after two weeks they announced that they where shutting it down. We as a community should be preparing for the worst. 
---
Stand fast or something? There's a mod that makes you harder to detect...but if you take 75% from perks...and do we have diminishing returns? Or max value...
---
Wat
---
Now I think of it, there was also a large face on the [Enclave Oil Rig](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/6/62/Loading02.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111103001212). Perhaps it really is just an art deco trope, perhaps Bethesda decided to run with it and made it so the Enclave is in the middle of it all.
---
I‚Äôve dropped turrets from my camp altogether since they never fire anyway. 
---
I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve stood there watching three mole rats chew at my crops and foundations while the turrets sit three meters away scanning back and forth. 
---
Or running back to camp chased by a pick rabid dogs expecting the turrets to help me take them down, and the turrets just sit on the sidelines and watch.
---
Communism 
---
I really like it, even with is flaws. Totally worth the $35 that I paid for it (300 hrs in). People say the the are no NPC but the vendor bots and super mutants are hilarious! You run into players roll playing as raiders and running into them is much like random raider encounters from fo2, but most are chill. I find it to be an emersive playing experience, when it is not bugging/glitching out.
---
The only thing that i got is the bomber outfit

 Just go in the door. 
---
 Are you trying to farm the place 'cause its a bit tough for low levels.
---
how do you have 20 quests? i don't think i ever had more than 4 or 5 at a time
---
Some vats pistol build dropped the all rise cuz it's junk for them, and a super mutant who was using a board picked it up cuz it's better. Mobs can access world containers.
---
Sorry to be hard on you lol it has issues but I love it 
---
Yikes.
---
Fix the games Stability First 
---
Without doing that you can't fire one bullet at anything 
---
Correct. There are no birds, because the Institute has not made any new ones yet. 
---
All I was trying to say was a free game with no hype is still way better than this trash heap I payed good money for .. no disconnects no gunplay issues and no money spent 
---
I'd wait until the end of March. The roadmap for DLC should be released within a fortnight, and it'll probably be substantive enough that you'll get a few dozen more hours
---
?Can only get better from here?
---
I picked up a bunch of inert flux and I have no idea what it‚Äôs for 
---
Oh it‚Äôs fine. Yeah I like it too.
---
Oh so that's why I had 700 carry weight. I also noticed that it's buffing the positive effects of my mutations
---
If you don't need a physical copy and want to play with a friend then go for it, don't think there's any good reason not to give it.
---
[This wiki](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Forbidden_Knowledge_\(Fallout_76\)) says you get a bigger reward if you're carrying 2 technical data instead of 1, though I don't know if that also affects the chance of getting plans.
---
I can usually find 2 really fast checking the desks in the command center of the Whitespring Bunker.
---
It still took me like 30 tries (didn't keep track) to get the shielded underlay plan that I wanted. I don't remember what other plans I got.
---
I have run into many, but now they remind me of random raider encounters from fo2... I think that it is a valid way to roll-play, but annoying AF.

Bugs were never an issue for me. I've just always loved the experience of playing Fallout games. Not sure how the multiplayer will sit with me, but I'll give it a shot in a week or 2 to see for myself. I like the idea of building my own homestead and venturing out for supplies and experience.

Server shouldn't matter it's just a really low chance. Just keep grinding and it'll happen eventually.

Never had that problen in hundreds of hours that I've played. Sucks for people who have though.

My love was for the traditional post-apocalyptic single player games and it's lore, experiences, quests, etc. I'll give it a try soon but the online aspect is what discouraged me for the longest time. 
---
People who have played all the games in the series are emotionally invested into the series, if they are posting that they don't like this game it's most likely because they wanted to be better. However, it won't improve unless negative feedback is loud enough to influence management decisions.
---
Im kind of tired of seeing people complain already. I get it the game has flaws but always a new post with someone super venting each time. 
---
If you pay under $30 and know the shitshow you‚Äôre getting into. Sure.
---
The most annoying are tse, and people baiting you into pvp so that their buddies can snipe you. The best thing to do is to not engage (or be better at pvp).
---
20 hours per vendor from wherever time you sell something. I sell daily at 7pm or so

Great post loved it, every time I've been in Watoga those "clusters" stand out to me and wonder wtf is up with them and the faces.
---
NPC will take different actions and engage differently with other NPC depending on how you complete a quest or even how you talk to them.
---
Nice!! Why can't I have neighbours like you.  I guess this guy will get the point when he's repaired things a few times.
---
Overpowered ! 
---
Hmm. 
---
My sense has. Been that after bulking, I was less encumbered, but l haven't looked at the actual weights. 
---
I was ready to bash your post but even though this game isn't fortnite, you're 100% correct I can't believe how many updates and changes and modes I've seen fortnite drop since October when this came out in Beta.
---
Not my point. The point is why do you stay subscribed to THIS sub about fo76 when you already stopped playing, quit the game entirely or just came here to bitch and complain. There already is a subreddit for people who are emotionally invested in the all the other games of the series, its called r/fallout 
---
I logged on and saw post after post saying thinking of selling fo76 give me a reason not to. Horrible attention seeking players. 
---
As someone who now wants to get this game, the picture you posted intrigues the hell out of me. I want to build a unique camp! 
---
Yeah lots of people think it weighs less but in actuality you just lose plastic weight 
---
I skimmed through the comments and didn't see anyone check out that fourth cluster in Watoga so I went up to have a look. [https://i.imgur.com/0nk5tTZ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0nk5tTZ.jpg) Seems to be the same as the rest like you expected. It's covered in vines but it's all solid underneath. One thing that's a little different about this cluster is that there's a staircase directly below it, so it can't really extend straight down like the other you had a photo of.
---
You can make it shrouded.  I think it's like shadowed in some respects. 
---
Lol... What?! They're way to easy
---
No, I haven't played Minecraft. But Minecraft has a robust, supportive playerbase and a robust, dyamic engine. Fallout 76 has had nothing but criticism and laughing from the gaming community, and the playerbase that is left is small and constantly dwindling. The lack of communication with the Fo76 community, the incredibly slow pace of their progress and patching, and the recent ITV makes me believe that even the devs are giving up on this. And when the impressive lineup of 2019 games come knocking (Anthem arrives in less than 2 weeks), I think you have to be naive and stubborn to think that 6 months from now, it will be financially worth it for BGS to add as much content and updates and changes as Minecraft has seen. From what I know about Minecraft it is infinitely much easier to change and patch and rework, because that is essentially what it is: a game that is an engine. It's not hard to change it or add to it. It is abundantly clear that even the smallest changes with the current Fo76 engine take weeks or months to do, and consoles are still downloading, what, 4GB of game files per patch? It's not going to happen. Again, BGS hasn't even figured out how to make it so you don't leak ammo when you pick up a damn flower. And when you look at their **realistic** sales numbers, which real [estimates show to be under 1 million](https://www.altchar.com/games-news/583928/sonys-feature-shows-fallout-76-doesnt-have-millions-of-players) (they claim they have sold "millions" of copies and that "millions of people are still playing, which is a lie), it would make zero sense for them to support this game and add content and features a fraction as much as Minecraft has, which has sold **100 million copies**.  
---
You can say it's not Bethesda's job to "hold my hand" to entertain me and all the players who have quit all you want (even though that's really exactly what their job is); I think the sales numbers suggest otherwise. Strongly. The fact that there is nothing to do, no NPCs, and no story, is exactly why this game has been a disaster for them (well that and the novel-sized list of bugs), that's why under 1 million people bought their game, that's why they have a 2.3 Metacritic rating, that's why the current playerbase is minuscule for a Bethesda title, and that is why this game is hemmorhaging money. The game will continue hemorrhaging money for them to even consider adding DLC, or even patch and maintain the game with the miniscule microtransaction profits they are making, and the money they will lose on pre-sales and even sales on future titles. It's been a PR disaster. It's been a CS disaster. It's been a sales disaster.  I didn't pay $60 for this game to "create my own story" and play pretend in the virtual wilderness, whether they were honest in their marketing claims or not, and neither did anyone else. I would be seriously surprised if there were 10,000 people playing this game in 6 months.  
---
To the rest of your points, even though I think you are being stubborn and living in a dream world (I'm sorry to be rude, I don't know how else to word it), let's assume you are right. It is not BGS's job to "hold my hand" (i.e. provide features and content), and it is entirely our responsibility to find things to do, or find outlets to "roleplay", or "make our own story". What does that look like to you? Assume I have already reached end-game, I've downed the SBQ, I've done all the main quests, and I've explored the map already. Give me an example of how I can use the game the way it was "intended" and "create my own story." Give me an example or scenario where I can make this game fun and relevant and immersive, assuming I've completed all the main quests and "faction" quests already. One that requires or adds hours to the game that will make all the disillusioned (and, quite frankly, bored) players want to continue playing this game over just uninstalling and picking up Anthem or Apex Predator or The Division 2 or Days Gone or Rage 2. Because that is what it will require for your last point to support your first one: a playerbase that sticks with and supports the game enough for BGS to continue throwing money and time and DLC at it. And please don't tell me "I don't know, I'm not going to hold your hand, you figure it out" because I think I'm being pretty damn reasonable here.

I have to say this is one of the best posts I have read here. Awesome that your friend is getting so much pleasure out of the game. 
---
The sarcasm is strong with this one.

Yes, yes and yes. To this day I still know the Capital Wasteland, Mojave Wasteland and Commonwealth like the back of my hand. Exploring for the first time is incredible with the mindset that it's post-apocalyptic and you never know what you'll come across.

They know it's over for redemption so they don't even try to put a ton of effort in, so they go as slow and lazy as possible on this hunk of shit. Maybe one day they will make this a good game with more content and bug fixes but with all the hate this game got I'm sure they dont give a fuck because it's simply too late. The damage is done
---
Or you know just fast travel to the vault more often than not someone will be with you in a second.

Then you will like this game. The multiplayer honestly isn't a big issue. 90% of the people I've run into and just trying to play the game and adventure too. I've joined up with a few and I've fought a few too but mostly everyone is chill. Plus it's a big map. And if you do get killed, you can just go back and get your junk unless they take it. It's gets a lot of shit bc of the mountain of issue but the concept and core of the game is very good. In short, if you're a fallout die hard fan, you're gonna enjoy
---
You mean... you're level 320??? Really? That's impressive! =]
---
People would buy shit if there was lots of it for cheap.  A few expensive things don't sell.
---
No one on the team took economics.
---
If you notice the quitting posts started to pick up speed after the failed patch. The next few weeks will reflect the results of the confidence that was lost.
---
If you don't want people making negative posts, ban emotionally driven posting, positive posts too. Keep everything factual and neutral.
---
From a game design perspective they explained the decision a while back as well. Something along the the lines of essential human NPCs being a distraction from the plots' various ways of explaining how each faction was wiped out. If there was a toon to talk to, you could just walk up to them and ask what happened to everyone. It detracts from the deliberate feeling of desolation and despair that is so prevalent and well crafted. With Rose being the only NPC you could actually do that with and her not giving half a crap about any of that, it still works. A real human would have gone nuts by the years of watching everyone else die or get turned - by all accounts its been almost a decade since any significant group of people lived here.

Sounds similar to the Giant Pigeons from Khorgoth of Barbaria? The ones they needed to use to go to the wizards floating castle?

Just to not pick your list a bit; wolves are native to the area, we just hunted them to extinction around here, and near extinction elsewhere. Idk if it's happen over 25 years, but without human intervention they'd return eventually.

Adding to the 1950s themes - some boss fights could include creatures like the Blob ([https://www.doublefeaturepreachers.com/shannons-reviews/the-blob-liked-it](https://www.doublefeaturepreachers.com/shannons-reviews/the-blob-liked-it))

Adding to the 50s alien boss themes, the Thing ([https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044121/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044121/))
---
Yes! In F1 and F2 (and even F3) there's a lot of that style, with faces everywhere. What caught my interest was discovering that the face in Dunwich borers is the same on the Lucky Hole Mine. I mean, to me it looks the same, I'm not 100% sure.
---
It's one of the vendors at the Whitesprings - Pendleton.
---
I love this post.
---
Thanks. What with the circlejerk surrounding it, I thought it might be nice to tell people that what matters in  a game is that you find it fun. Maybe The Witcher 3 is a better game, but I'm sure as hell my friend wouldn't have "clicked" the same way with it,.
---
Some of these are clearly intentional decorations. The style isn't consistent and imo none of the faces trulyatch each other. Still intriguing though.
---
Indeed. Clint Eastwood is perfect in the role. 
---
I don't give a fuck what people have to say on here, negative or positive. The question was "why do you stay subscribed to this specific subreddit, if you are 100% done with the game"? It doesn't make any logical sense unless of course they aren't really done with game. Example post: "THATS IT BETHESDA IM DONE WITH YOUR STUPID GAME, HAVE FUN WITH A FAILED GAME LOSERS." Skip ahead to a few days later and the same person is still making posts on this sub.
---
I feel like people will be to dumb to get what your actually saying judging by some comments already lol
---
That sub isn't active at all
---
That...makes no sense. Game theory is a major academic concept utilized in political science and economics. It has nothing to do with video games.
---
&gt;Why are you still playing?
---
Lol I gave up in December you guys are troopers thank you for your service
---
This gives me quantifiable numbers I can can work with related to the total build budget and the 'cost' of two 'yardstick' items.
---
I'll have to do some experiments after that to see if my data from the workshops extrapolates into CAMP build budgets.
---
But it's a place to start.
---
That gave a good lol. Thanks.
---
Clever girl. 
---
I could have sworn I had a rad roach open a door before. I had to kill it before it procreated further. 
---
Seriously. u/JustAnAce believes this is satirical. Let‚Äôs point and laugh
---
People checking back to see if anything has changed are not done with the game, They still have hope for it or they would not be checking if it has improved.
---
 Chad ... you don't know Chad? He is cool! 
---
 I may have farmed the network for too long. ;)
---
I never knew anyone thought puns were funny until I started coming to reddit.
---
And then EA or Activision will buy FO and ES. Even with the mistakes of FO76, it's still better than anything that would happen if the IP's got sold. 
---
Possible lag, or just pissed off at how broken the game is
---
You guys get it 
---
i feel like this particular mystery was meant to culminate with the lucky hole mine and it was just found/connected out of order :/.  environmental hints in cool unique looking/important places that indicate that those particular vines can be entered and that there is a secret somewhere.  then eventually the player notices those vines in lucky hole and find you-know-what there.  i do hope there is more to it though, its easily the most interesting thing about the game imo.
---
Sbq drops are glitched 
---
Bethesda: were aware and are fixing it on a particular date
---
You:Let me to a run anyways and then bitch about it
---
I‚Äôve seen muties had over to a corpse to pick up a better weapon. I would be surprised if they went to a world container. 
---
Try Sons of Dane Compound and the Ammo Dump across the street. Two very close PA spawns that I always farm for 51 and 60.
---
 ROTFLMFAO!
---
If you finish ‚ÄúMayor for a Day‚Äù, they won‚Äôt come after you until you shoot first.  Does not apply inside buildings
---
Their beta wasn't about collecting data and fixing problems. They were too arrogant for that. In their eyes, the game was done. This was a beta in name only. They told us, if we had feedback to leave it on social media. They had no plan to collect data. No official channels. No in game bug report UI. It was on us to write it all up on Reddit, or Twitter or the forums and hope it got noticed. They never were interested in what had to say.
---
when I say they are doing something. I mean they are filling a void. They talking just to take up space. They don't need anyone to write down what is wrong. They are professional developers. The entire goal here is to keep people busy. To give the illusion of accessibility.
---
 &gt; Also way to assume everyone who plays this game is a fucking moron. I'll have to screen cap this so next time I feel like calling someone a moron on this sub reddit I can just point to you.
---
That's cute.
---
 &gt; Based on your years working in the support department of a video game company?
---
So you're saying the developers are morons and can't figure out what's wrong with their game based on two months worth of forum posts and constant Youtube videos? You're saying they need to have written for the 150th time in a special location for it to count?
---
 &gt; Or based on assumptions from terms that you don't understand. Or more specifically have been abused by companies to hell and back so much since early release became popular on steam so that their original meaning has been lost. Pretty sure Fortnite still calls it self in beta and RDR2 Online has been in beta for what 4 months at this point?
---
I stand by my assertion. And my grasp of definitions. You've merely identified a few examples of companies that *also* abuse the term.
---
I miss NPCs... It would be nice to see a squadron of vertibirds landing at the Morgantown airport and lay claim to the area and make it an Enclave quest hub sort of like this mod from Fallout New Vegas:
---

---
*shrug*  
---
I'm really good at grinding, lol
---
‚ÄúOnly the strongest will survive‚Äù - Breaking Benjamin - Halo 2 
---
I mean, a giant man-eating bat that screams green donuts is pretty terrifying. Makes sense.
---
That's a good guess. The placement of the vines are very curious, imo. They're used to hide things, so why are they there? =]]
---
I think the plans died along with the BoS plans. However you can still find the flechette mods at vendors.
---
 Its why I need my Jet Pack before I do this seriously. ;)
---
And now I'm SCARRED
---
hahaha I see... well, that's a talent, for sure! =]
---
Ok then. The problem is alot of those people aren't here to just check if anything has changed, they're also here to insert their shitty low effort posts and comments about a game they haven't played since the beta, and they will openly admit to just flippantly shitting on the game having no knowledge of the past patches, bug fixes etc. 
---
Hes having fun 
---
What? 
---
Raiders 
---
They have spawned in and attacked me every time I have logged in for the last few days..  
---
Griefing us Redditors? ;)
---
I think critters aren't common enough.
---
Yeah, I see where this is going... 
---
Any theories on who is paying the mods and shills?
---
Sounds like you‚Äôve got a prolapsed rectum. I‚Äôd see a doctor 
---
Very nice base! Nice change up instead of seeing a boring giant tower or rickety skybase.
---
Law of unintended consequences...   
---
The vendors can't display all the plans the Dev's shoehorned into their inventories...
---
I'll settle with just the mod, do you know which vendors specifically?
---
Yes, we need Dog meat companions!
---
Did anyone actually confirm is scales with level or was that all anecdotal?
---
If you were serious you'd threaten to leave mean comments on all the Fallout tweets too. 
---
The Game needs a major rebalance, it's not about nerfing melee, but bringing ranged builds to par
---
Wait Pabelo lost Jennifer to Antonio?! 
---
(throws chair out window)
---
**FUCK! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGH!**
---
&gt;Mega Sloth
---
Yep checks out 
---
This face is also connected to a cult from point lookout cult
---
 My hemorrhoids are my business. Kudos.
---
I'd be lagging or just extremely pissed off because the game is broken
---
do you not use the junk extractor just down the hill? My camp is in the same place but I'm built up on the monorail track &amp; more towards the junk node.
---
No they haven't moved on. This sub needs to stop being so stupid over every little thing.
---
I got them off a scorched beast lvl 80, yesterday. 
---
This is... just wow... 
---
Gotta say, I came here expecting a PornVault link based on that title...
---
Yea I cant believe you pre ordered this game. Yikes
---
I see you left out the ‚Äúand business is good‚Äù part. 
---
How‚Äôs your first quarter coming along?
---
The use of the sword to UPGRADE itself was totally not made clear.  
---
I assumed we'd be able to craft or, back at base, resource one.  
---
Horrible mistake by Bethesda not to make the methodology CLEAR for the MoM weaponry.
---
A main quest line for the Enclave &amp; MODUS could be getting another sample of the Scorch Serum / vaccination so the Enclave could come to WV and finish what the Brotherhood could not. This could open the door for Human NPCs to make their way back into WV.
---
Thanks for the input.
---
Is it attached to any quests, or is it just a random tag? 
---
Shit üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
 Do I know you? You seem familiar. 
---
Possibly one of the Pleasant Valley vendors.
---
Lights.
---
Todd Howard doesn‚Äôt need me to remind him he‚Äôs a stinky pants, he‚Äôs in wafting distance 
---
I‚Äôm level 63 and just saw them in Harper‚Äôs Feery today. Specifically went looking for them for my sister-in-law; I can definitely still buy them. You‚Äôll be fine! üëç
---
I'd love them to tie damage to a stat for *all* weapons, like:
---
S melee, heavy
---
P rifles, shotgun
---
I energy
---
A pistol
---
Honestly I think you should give it six months and see how everything turns out. The game hasn‚Äôt been in an overly stable state since release and not much is certain about its future at the moment. If you wait you will either experience a much better version of the game or you will have avoided a fairly disappointing time sink. 
---
You know you can unlock all the mods just by scrapping arms, right?
---
You dont wanna farm for more legendaries? Maybe you can grind for more levels which means nothing. Your really missing out on fun gameplay and a rewarding grind system. Also the Atom store prices are totally fair and not a jew like system
---
 I had 3 level 80s there just a few days ago. They are so decorative lying on the ground. ;)
---
I have yet to play it... is the face similar or, like, identical?
---
If I remember correctly they said the amount of data to play this game was supposed to be low, so no excuses on cheap internet
---
I think I heard that one if the two Grafton bots also sell excavator plans 
---
Almost identical, as much as fallout 3 graphics shows it
---
Penitentiary Escort mission is where I got mine. Heard everyone say you can get it there so went and checked it out and got it my first try. Apparently that was super lucky to get it first try?? Lol. I‚Äôd just go that route instead of buying the plans. 
---
Friends list desyncs after roughly 5 minutes, cannot see invites to groups or send invites, if in a party already, cannot change party leadership or leave/rejoin the party
---
Sometimes loading into the game, friends list has wrong player names playing
---
Both can be fixed by exiting game and closing the launcher completely and starting the game again
---
For legs???
---
Mate this game was made for people like us. I remember traveling the Mojave with binoculars in my hand just because I loved sightseeing. I‚Äôd pick a spot on the map and just go for it. This game has about 5 or 6 big areas for exploration and you can find holotapes of previous survivors among the rubble. 
---
If anything do what I did and rent it from redbox for a day or two. I rented the game for three days and I was absolutely hooked. I‚Äôm just now reaching almost 150hours and I haven‚Äôt even touched the main quests or side quests, I‚Äôve been exploring and talking to people from all over the world. 
---
It‚Äôs actually incredible when you have a chance to talk to someone. If you get griefed don‚Äôt be discouraged since they‚Äôre few and far between. It‚Äôs buggy sometimes but I find myself enjoying it more than hating it. 
---
Wow a single player community doesnt like it when their game becomes a shitty rushed trashy multiplayer game. Im so shocked
---
If you betray someone's trust don't be surprised if they treat you in a negative way.
---
Bethesda did that, someone playing since beta may have paid 200 dollars, gotten a very short beta, and been lied to about a canvas bag of all things to lie about.
---
People still want fo76 to succeed but they don't trust Bethesda. 
---
Cool, I'll look into it!!! Thanks a lot! =]]
---
Wow.  I'm going to have to keep an eye out.  I like those details.
---
Jokes on you they added more items to the Atom shop 
---
Good to know they're still attainable in some form or another!
---
It only appears for the point you're picking for level 42 and up. I'm not sure I'm phrasing that right, but basically if you have 4 points saved up from levels 40 to 43, you'll only be able to pick things level 40 and below, then 41 and below, *then* your Bloody Mess 42, 43.
---
If you're on xbox and on layer tonight, if I still have it the plan is yours. I've already read them.
---
Nice.  Why the extra gennies with a fusion generator?  Convenience?
---
I don't actually mind the new system personally, server hopping wasn't fun at all. But it'd certainly help if the new system worked haha
---
For the torso too, and helmet paints. Technically you can scrap any piece of that armor type, but arms are the cheapest to craft.
---
I think that is just the cutthroats tag. 
---
Also this face is connected to the dunwich inc. 
---
, Because both of the ur structures in both games we meet them in have some kind of ritual romm in it. (Fallout 4: Dunwich borers and Fallout 3: Dunwich building fallout 3)
---
did that last night. sat my butt on the ground till someone came and shot them a message "thank you" 
---
No1 cares
---
Good to know. Thanks! 
---
It's just like a bad relationship. I deleted the game once, then reinstalled it after patches. Then I decided not to play it for a while, later changed my mind.
---
This, seriously. The art asset is out there; why does every CAMP need to either use an outhouse, or a busted piece of crap?
---
For godssake - I managed to build a **fusion generator** out of garbage. You're saying I can't jack a clean john out of the Whitespring?
---
Elder scrolls is way better, whether you mean the mmo or even Skyrim. Apparently those studios don‚Äôt share on how they make games good, the fallout studios don‚Äôt seem to get it heh
---
If youre on ps4, i can sell for 800 caps the plan
---
The pvp is like the pvp in rdr2 online. Its pretty fucking boring and will put you to sleep in a good hour maybe more if you had a drink or two
---
Oneshooting everything is no fun.
---
Why are you here
---
Canvas bag has nothing to do with the actual gameplay though and almost all of the hate has been towards the game itself and the players that remain. If people are so infuriated with bethesda then maybe they should call their support line and give them their two cents. This sub isn't a bethesda hotline. If you don't trust bethesda, then don't trust them, don't buy their games anymore, and unsubscribe from this sub... simple.
---
Tried. You can‚Äôt destroy them 
---
Thanks, I'll check them
---
Yep, the one not in the train station
---
Somerset at higher than level 5 would be a game changer.
---
Hop in!
---
*shrug* disagree, but to each his own 
---
Ive always been a range build and they need to make it a viable build ingame
---
To keep myself updated about the game. If they fix what's broken, I'll buy it
---
\&gt;  Their beta wasn't about collecting data and fixing problems. They were  too arrogant for that. In their eyes, the game was done. This was a beta  in name only. 
---
What is this based on? Because so far you have done nothing but project your opinions on their actions without anything to support your statements other then wanting it to be true. 
---
\&gt;  They told us, if we had feedback to leave it on social media. They had  no plan to collect data. No official channels. No in game bug report UI.  It was on us to write it all up on Reddit, or Twitter or the forums and  hope it got noticed. They never were interested in what had to say. 
---
And they have been listening to feed back about bug fixes and other issues. How do you think the TSE nerf happened? Literally reading social media posts about how bullshit over powered it is. And tracking how it was the only gun really being used. What they are doing now is branching out beyond just basic game bug fixes and trying to improve or over haul entire sections of content to improve the over all game.  An over haul to events or new mobs with new mechanics is that content so many people complain the game lacks any to do.   
---
\&gt;  That's cute. 
---
Your words dude. Your entire logic relies on everyone having the memory of a gold fish and not remembering all previous complaints because Bethesda started asking specific questions to deal with specific issues. 
---
\&gt;  So you're saying the developers are morons and can't figure out what's  wrong with their game based on two months worth of forum posts and  constant Youtube videos? You're saying they need to have each point  written for the 150th time in a special location for it to count? No, I  base it on 40 years of life, and being reasonably intelligent. 
---
So you don't even read my  responds do you? Or are you so annoyed I'm talking sense your ego jumps in to purposefully misrepresent everything I said to make you look less silly?  
---
They have asked for specific feed back about events and now mobs. As well as announcing looking into adjusting stuff like durability levels on energy weapons and reducing heavy weapon ammo to make the guns more viable because of feed back.  How ever when you want specific questions like how to improve on events or what kind of mobs do you like and what kind of mobs do you see in the future. Asking questions for content over hauls is how they get detailed information without needing to swim though all the posts to find the few tid bits. You are ignoring these questions come about because of player feed back. One leads to the other not the other way around as you keep trying to insist.  
---
This is way Jagex the creators of Runescape held no less then 4 in game polls and 3 e-mail polls as well as created an entire sub forum to talk about the mining and smithing rework before they put the resources in to over haul the out dated system the game has.  Getting detailed ideas on what players wanted and what they should aim for before devoting resources and man hours to bring the system more up to date.  
---
\&gt;  I stand by my assertion. And my grasp of definitions. You've merely identified a few examples of companies that *also* abuse the term. 
---
But you don't because there are two kinds of betas. Ones that are early builds of the game which is basically what early release is on steam and X box. And B.E.T.A that is basically a server stress test.  How ever there was far more wrong with it during that and they were not set up to handle the sheer number of problems that ended up happening.  Launch didn't help much either so they had to catch up on a lot of back logged issues. 
---
No, he really isn‚Äôt. Unless this game goes free to play or is made a free game of the month on consoles then it has already seen the majority of its players. The hype has already come and gone.
---
The first thing I will figure out, very quickly, is if there is a delta in build budget based on anything about characters. 
---
If every response for a specific workshop is identical; at least I can say workshop numbers have nothing to do with character *anything*.
---
Doesn't mean CAMP budgets definitely don't, but it does supply something valuable - constants that can be referenced against - if nothing else I can build an index of CAMP item 'cost' for each workshop. 
---
That will allow me to start gathering data to see if there is some kind of match or ratio between the workshop item cost and the item cost in CAMPs. Once I have that, I should be able to begin 'calculating' build budgets and combinations of items to build them. Then I can test those predictions in the game to refine my data.
---
This is really not much more than application of the scientific method to the FO76 game world. 
---
I'm RPing a scientist. ;)
---
About time someone posted something positive instead of coming here to cry like a little girl.
---
I was killed by one in FO4 in survival mode near the first satelitte station you encounter...I still remember the bip bip coming at me without figuring what was happening.
---
Just give it to him, maybe he will enjoy the game.
---
This feels like such easy end game content. Make a quest line out of it, and an achievement, and a new set of armor. Honestly sometimes it feels like Bethesda made this game in a vacuum where no other MMO‚Äôs existed. 
---
Beth, if you‚Äôre listening, for fucks sake copy some of what WoW/Guild Wars/Final Fantasy and countless others have implemented! Ffs WoW had multiple world dragons in Vanilla, 15 years ago.
---
ooohh ok, thx
---
The main mystery is not this faces, it's more a meaning and a cult they represent, because we can meet this faces even in museum of technology in fallout 3 and couple of places in lonesome road. 
---
Almost every video game location is doing sales. Steam has a lunar new year sale and a bunch of Blizzard games have the same. 
---
 Almost bought that one. I need my X0-1 camo though. ;)
---
for real? this would explain all the non legendary in white springs dropping them maybe. ill have to pay more attention to that.
---
You can also jump on the terminal then jump on the roof
---
I'm saving for cool armour paint.  But I mostly use Excavator and Ultracite, so... no luck?
---
Because you havnt played it. Dont sub to a reddit on a game you dont play and then bitch about. Crybaby
---
This feedback would be GOLD to any sane company. Too bad Bethesda will something do the exact opposite of what what suggested here
---
GT: Driveinkiller
---
Add me up! I've got a lvl 12 guy I'd be happy to run around with. A pretty dope Cliffside CAMP in the works too!
---
I've done it myself a few times. It's a free fast travel spot, what do they have to lose most of the time after all? I'm sure they'll probably just fast travel back to there camp after all and go back to whatever they were doing. 
---
When I lose a PvP encounter, whether I was into it or not, I make my way back to the aggressor and tell them good game and that they won decisively. I ask for advice.
---
I've never been disappointed. Always ends amicably. 
---
People are okay in this game, even the griefers. They're just bored.
---
Have a conversation!
---
Okay thanks :)
---
   
---
they helped me after 24 days 
---
It's Great Fun blowing these well made camps up 
---
 I play a rarity ... a balanced build. For solo play its good to be able to do it all and I run 15 Strength. Its kinda necessary to have that just to carry stuff, and use the melee aspect, the game makes so strong.
---
I am excited to put this in my camp it will go great in my mess hall
---
Can it withstand a nuke? What system you on?
---
Hey thanks a lot, that was what I was going for! Getting the slabs in place so everything fit definitely took the longest.
---
That's cute, i remember my first beer.
---
That may seem to indicate that the Scorch Beasts aren't the big bad of the story.  We know what when folks get scorched that they seems to be controlled by a hive mind.  It's always been thought the Scorch Queen was the cause but really couldn't they just be carriers like for rabies?  Those annoying bats could just be victims.
---
He's the only cool Chad. Pretty funny too. 
---
My new broken game is to get the highest bounty I can everyday.
---
It's Super Fun watching noobs leave after 
---
Thanks! :)
---
There are chickens though
---
Yeah, whats up with that? I can get Ultracite but the X0-1 is pretty good. I do love the Glass Cavern though. That really is well done. ;)
---
Beth fixed FO:NV?  No.  More like, small studio Obsidian requested a time extension so they wouldn't release a buggy, partially complete, broken game and Bethesda vetoed that so they would get the game out on schedule.  Broken game gets lauded for excellent writing, murdered for the many game breaking bugs.
---
Sound familiar?
---
Thanks brother, I really appreciate it!  Stay safe in the wastes!
---
I'm not sure why you think a banjo with spikes wouldn't be more dangerous than a .50 cal sniper rifle if the dude wielding the banjo had level 10 strength arm canons on him.
---
Get real bro. 
---
ü§£
---
Got an over 2k bounty right now, you can have it if you can kill me. GT:Rocky Two Milli
---
My crits tickled her. Absolutely unreal.
---
It took me and some rando about 7 minutes of running (and dying). 
---
I'm on PS4 but I appreciate the generous offer!
---
My character is level 70, right now so I think I have the max budget for building, but I'm not sure. This build had no turrets which take up huge chunks of the budget.
---
Ah darn! Np, even though I'm a raider i still like to help out! 
---
God I hope it is sarcasm. The way people mourn their tse around here I'm still not entirely sure.
---
Someone please help me:
---
Sound issue:
---
I can‚Äôt hear gunshots or footsteps.
---
I‚Äôm using Steelseries Arctic 7. Is anyone else experiencing this issue? It was working then it stopped and I haven‚Äôt been able to resolve.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
 ROTFLMFAO again. They are downvoting you!
---
Excuse the noob question, but how do you get a bounty?
---
Destroy camps
---
I played it and enjoyed it to be honest but i do also agree with ya on some of it and def can see your opinion. 
---
I still didnt finish it completely but will eventually. Got bored and bugs were wearing me down.  I got my moneys worth so far.  Least ya tried man.  
---
1.- I really only expect two things, to have a better game for the 60 bucks I paid. And(or) to Bethesda to realize they fucked up, so starfield or TESVI isn't as shitty as this. 
---
2. If I can't enjoy my game be sure I'll be at least take some pleasure disliking it.
---
3.they can make the game enjoyable, it has potential, they can make a good dlc or revamp the game entirely no man's sky style, they can own their failures. 
---
I'm interested but that's a little steep, how about 600?
---
Oh never knew that. That's cool though.
---
Dude, you've done a man's work.  UPPED
---
Oh god, this is hilarious. I literally laughed out loud at the Mass Effect line. So many delusional people around here.
---
I got a bounty from something, I think I took from a extractor at a claimed workshop and it netted me a 10 cap bounty or something tiny.  Dropped off all my junk, fast traveled to the church in Flatwoods, took off my armor, and kneeled down in the middle of the room.  Literally three people all under lvl 20 were there within 30 seconds.  All paused and just looked at me for 10 - 15 seconds like "Is this a trap?".  I gave a thumbs up and two of the three rushed in to melee me while the third just sat there.
---
Jesus, stalking past posts? Psychoooo. Blocking you, psycho stalker troll. 
---
Thank you! =]]]
---
Go luck.
---
Also, this sub needs to have flairs for system.
---
I've heard it does and heard it doesn't. Never confirmed either way :(
---
Only in sale
---
Xbox, the base is at Whitesprings, yes it can withstand a direct Nuclear Strike because it's structure is indestructable
---
Enemy diversity? They completely removed all potential human faction enemies making the diversity in enemies miniscule compared to any fallout gamr
---
I need to know how to build this.  
---
Nice theory, I haven't thought about that! =]
---
Freemasons are Illuminati.
---
Praise the Sloth
---
Nah sorry fallen for stuff like that before
---
But if u want to straight up hand it 2 me I‚Äôll take it
---
Shoot, I forgot to put it in- I'm on Xbox.
---
Someone mentioned that they believed that vendors had a max amount of plans they could display (which I mentioned to LadyDevann the other day). That could explain why people aren't seeing all the plans available. Not sure why it wouldn't show the same plans for everyone. Leftover code maybe?
---
Yes, it could be that the faces are just a representation of some entity... still a good mystery, I think. 
---

Eh. I got a happy 100 hours out of it. It would have been worth $60, but I paid $35. Pretty dissatisfied compared to the replayability of other fallout games, but still worth $60.
---
$85? Sorry bro, you got had.
---
üòÜ

You can‚Äôt explain that! 
---
Another shit post with dumb upvotes nice
---
The damage Mr Gutsy line does with energy weapons makes player weapons feel like flashlights. 
---
ah ok im ps4 
---
It does not scale with level. This is a myth. 
---
It's in your flair jackass. Anybody can see you pre ordered the game by just at your flair
---
Exactly! Like I said, there's a connection between Lucky Hole Mine and Dunwich Borers, since the faces are the same! =]]]

I'm a noob.  Lately I've been having problems respawning.  When it takes me to the respawn map now, it gives me an option to place my marker instead of respawn.  And the place marker doesn't even work.  I've been just turning it off and playing a different game.   If I restart can I still at least get my materials back?
---
Back flip!
---
Strength boosts melee damage, so Perception should boost ranged damage. 
---
i thought those things in watoga were like ‚Äúnests‚Äù for scorchbeasts
---
Yeah, I use it. I just didnt feel like showcasing it.
---
Problem is that the last time I played fallout 3 was on Russian so now I am trying to find and translate some info for you.
---
There‚Äôs no excuse for energy damage other than laziness or incompetence.
---
Just resell it like others have said 
---
If not then make a little lottery and have the winner pay for the shipping! 
---
Then I spend another hour or so repairing armor/weapons, bulking, selling etc and it is time to go to sleep or work. This game is taking me fucking ages to get through. I honestly don't know how all these people are complaining about lack of end game content. I am only just exploring through the middle of the map now in the areas that radiate out from the top of the world questline.
---
Yeah - but I killed the 3 of them ...  so rude these stupid bats with wings ...
---
There really seems to be a lack of a single coherant vision for this game.
---
I don't get why people are downvoting the most logical explanation posted in this thread. HAve an upvote.
---
Wait can you pick up more then 1 tech data at a time? I'm on xb1 and if I pick up a 2nd it deletes the other. Was this patched?
---
I like the compactness. One Fusion generator can power my whole place without the need of multiple large ones. Besides the lights I'm running 3 turrets and a junk extractor off of it. Which would need two large generators to power. 
---
More the. Likely they have already moved most of the crew over to those games, giving up on this but they still have a small crew working on it. There goal right now is probably to get es6 out faster so they can recover from the financial losses from fallout 76.
---
I played Skyrim and liked it. I was more referring to the MMO. If there was a similar situation when it launched. But apparently not as I don‚Äôt recall hearing this much negative stuff about it.
---
If you're getting the game, prepare for an possibly long install time, I've been waiting for about 14 hours now to play the game. 
---
Yup. Studio 58.
---
When I feel grief-y I take a orbital strikebeacon, find a camp, toss, and run. Doesnt do major damage to walls, but will break generators, water pumps, and crops. 
---
.50 cents
---
Putting all the bitching and complaining from the casuals aside, this is what fallout is really about. Discovering the lore, putting the pieces of a giant puzzle together that is only possible in the aftermath of a nuclear Armageddon because of the access it gives you to places you otherwise wouldn't have.
---
They need to double down on 76
---
Oh man, that was beautiful... *wipes tear from eye*
---
Sure! Let me check for sure if i still have me
---
Em
---
Nice, I was about to say, that‚Äôs the whole draw of that location! Cool camp, I like the open idea. I used to get a lot of traffic through my open camp on the junk extractor by the satellite facility, met some cool people and only a handful of greifers. 
---
A kind soul gave me a tse lvl 45 handmade when I was like lvl 15. Just got to use it finally and it is simply awesome. I couldn't imagine what it was like pre nerf because it still packs a punch.  Best thing about having the plans is being able to craft and scrap for mods.
---
All Hive Minds in fiction tend to have a hierarchy of control. The Zerg from Starcraft, the Tyranids of Warhammer 40k, the Flood from Halo etc. Even the examples in reality like Bees and Ants, which Hive Minds are likely inspired by or derived from have a hierarchy. 
---
For the Scorched, I'd imagine it goes the Queen &gt; Scorchbeasts &gt; the rest of the affected. Considering the life span of a scorched Human results in petrification, which looks identical to how they are prior to it, there is obviously no evolution or divergence in looks for a human controller. If Humans are used as controllers/leaders/whatever, there would be no way to determine their role with the exception of observation of their behaviour and the behaviour of the scorched around them.
---
I'm not sure if Bethesda's writers/lore team really think of this stuff though. Considering all enemies have levels displayed, it does make me wonder why they didn't go with the naming system you suggest. There are ten different scorched, we'll keep Warrior, Scorched and Wanderer, cause they can be used. So seven words relating to plague and a hive mind... Afflicted, Plaguebearer, Infected, Infested, Diseased, Blighted, Enslaved, Oppressed, Enthralled. There's nine, pick up your game Bethesda. 
---
I used to have a sybase, I just got so tired of not being able to place my camp anywhere I wanted due to uneven ground when travelling. So i just used one foundation and then stairs up to the main base. It got me through the main storyline. Now that I'm done moving around I can have a normal one.
---
I wish I was that eloquent...
---
I think if your adding all this you should add skyrim aswell as there are so many things ported from there aswell.
---
In the famous words of Meat Loaf - "Two out of hree ain't bad"
---
There was that lighthouse location in the north that had 2+ death laws. 
---
Exactly, the lore is what makes me love this series. I hope they'll dig deeper into it in the future of 76. 
---
I just found hubba hubba written in the Outhouse at Lakeside Cabins.
---
I can only take so many game crashes before my frustration turns to camp anger.

It's not their fault, it's Bethesda's

Do you want Final Pam? This is how you get Final Pam.

We live in hope.
---
It's a gray area.
---
Yeah, that seems no more selfish than turrets, with all those sirens.
---
The player who wants to use his turret camp, will never see and not likely much listen that thing. He will not stay there. 
---
Their camp is already blocked by any other turret camp.

LVL 92 3 STAR LEGENDARY JETPACK SCORCHED LEADER, BRING IT ON

do not forget to visit the store

those are the ones I have but the rough wood on an astroturf deck does not look pleasing at all, I'd like something the same size but more like a real deck railing.
---
The area nearby the Salem Witchcraft Museum?
---
Ok...I'm late on this thread, but how about adding a randomly spawning, high-leveled scorched wandering beast thing? Something like Phylakes in Assassin's Creed, but a lot harder, and a better random spawn point and patching.  They spawn in a random location (pipboy gives spawn alert, but no location is given...maybe give a Geiger counter tick as you get close).  This enemy requires ultracite-based weapon damage (weapon or bullet), and can create on-the-spot fissures that will spawn a lot of scorched enemies and/or scorchbeasts. 
---
This event should not be a solo event, but require some coordination on ad control and boss damage.  This promotes team coordination, or telling lower levels to help handle the ads.  
---
In the end, **The loot must be good**.

You might want to go back and read what you first typed to me, Mr. Criticizer. also /r/PCMR is not what you think it is, if you believe me to be an "elitist" for which you criticize me for. Anyway if you feel like being even more wrong please respond back, I look forward to our talks.

The silos were fun. But after 50 run thrus, they become quite monotonous.

The recent patch made these plans appear on the regular at watoga and Harper's ferry

I didn't read everything, so it may already say this, but maybe make it slot based. Like certain effects take up a certain amount of slots and you have to actually grind to add slots to a weapon of your choice, so you can add more effects. Similar to Disgaea evilities.
---
Give us a fridge as a common plan and a working freezer as a rare one. The fridge should slow spoilage and the freezer should stop it outright as long as the food says in it.

because clearly the people posting here have anything to do with your little temper tantrum

What game are you talking about when you mention *BOS*?

I'm betting Microsoft would buy up Fallout at Light Speed. Dont forget, they bought Obsidian. Getting their hands on the Fallout IP would be a dream.
---
If i did not loose my caps and junk that i work for so hard
---
I believe the Garrahan estate had pet sloths in a small zoo of sorts. At least, the box labeled ‚Äúsloth food‚Äù leads me to believe that. It seems a stretch that a few caged animals mutated and spread all over West Virginia, but crazier things have happened. 
---
Honestly, if they had sloths in cages, maybe they had other exotic animals? *insert new mutant enemy here*
---
" Level 135 to make it even worse, he knows better. So I kept closing the doors. He would open then. I would close them. When the doors are closed they get nada. This went on for a good 15 minutes until he finally left the server.
---
That doesn't sound good turret camp. Good one has turrets to the level to the windows.
---
Closing the door doesn't block much, the ones that turret shoot, get aggroed and drag most of others from basement floor to the camp anyway, if no player is there to stop them.
---
Oh really? I haven't played it huh?
---
Ask me anything about any mission. Anything. I beat the entire game ages ago. 
---
Love the last line of defense 'you've never played this  game'.
---
Might want to check my post history genius...
---
My account isn't new either.
---
Looks like I got em! Xcarlagunodx, my place?
---
If they really end up letting people bring their characters over from Adventure mode it's going to be a huge mess of dupers and people who farmed or bought the best legendaries just running around killing everyone. Once those guys get their jollies they'll move on to whatever new free to play flavor-of-the-month competitive game is out and the game will be even more barren.
---
I've been to White springs a total of five times, trying to complete the federal golfers quest. Two out of the five there were scorchbeasts. I just assumed that was normal for that area.
---
Lmao all Bethesda does is abandon their games and leave it to modders to fix them. And thank god too since every time Bethesda tries to fix them they just make it worse. Bethesda is completely just sitting waiting for the few fanboys left to jump off 76 so they can let it die. 
---
When did we get to kiddy hour
---
Fix the fucking game First
---
Yup.
---
The only problem with power armor is the fact theres so much Armor Penetration in this game. Anyone in power armor is like a walking 1 shot since i know you dont have assassin sentinel/cavalier to protect you.

Most people who PVP on here are killing players with Zealots or Vanguard armour geared towards PVE. ..they won't last 5 minutes in PVP with people READY to fight so they will continue to attack unprepared players and claim VICTORY.

Before release, I said the decision to not have any human NPCs was going to make the world boring and I always got flak for it.
---
Yeah, it would be the willful murder of the Fallout franchise.

Btw,before you call me a liar (again),I'll tell you I have plenty of time in game and can ss proof (my gt is same so will leave no doubt),not that I HAVE to prove myself to you.

I put a prime receiver on mine, and want to take it back to a standard two shot.

You don‚Äôt double down on a bad hand. Why reinforce failure when you can commit resources to something else you can profit from. 
---
I‚Äôd like a better game, sure... but they don‚Äôt need to double down... we just want them to. 
---
Schorched? Fellow german spotted
---
it may be one small step, but its one giant leap to get there.
---
What do you need a few thousand caps for?
---
Xbox servers are empty.
---
That's why you here asking. 2 weeks ago I had 222 friends who played it. Now they've all given up. I will soon. Just need to hunt down some more noobs. See you around the empty Xbox servers haha
---
bye
---
false. Once the capture begins, it triggers pvp for the whole team against the owner.
---
Sentinel armor
---
Thank you sir!
---
the restriction on MODUS was to stop a buyback dupe cheat, 2 players could buy back the same weapon/armour at the same time so the fix was to limit him to one player at a time.
---
Nope.
---
So your friend is exploting and should be banned
---
I had to scroll down. The watoga vendor has a ton
---
I agree with statement 100% - do not reinvent the wheel - there are tons of things you could look at in other MMOs and follow their examples and pulling them into fallout 76 - give us Dancing! I want to celebrate - Sell us new dances in the ATOM shop - whatever .. do it!
---
Hey, I'm not available till next week but I'm a decent tank on xbox
---
Completely agree. In survival mode nothing should be safe, you have 3 minutes to get out......that's plenty of time.
---
Oh ok, I wish I had some armor I could donate actually
---
I routinely get lower level gear from nuke zones. I got a level 15 from whitesprings today. 
---
I‚Äôd like to try it out.  500 caps?
---
Blob is freaking perfect, what an amazing enemy to fight,!
---
Gotta call in my friend with the flamethrower ! 
---
The last time I played was the session where I realized I had spent considerably more time managing the incredibly limited inventory than I was playing. It sent me down a spiral where I realized that any additional time investment was pointless because I'm not able to actually keep more rewards once I've gotten to the point where I don't want to get rid of anything.
---
Turned the game off and haven't started it since.
---
Everything started before the war, in 2058. That year the woman named Constance moves from Dunwich to Point Lookout, because in a "New Plague". Apparently she then becomes  the leader of a cult the worships the god, who's name I can't pronounce. But before that she meets a man named Mr.Blackhole. Constance somehow knew that he has a book that helps controlling people, this book name was Krivbeknin. After Constance finally gets her hands on this book her husband "mysteriously" dies. Then we find out that the main reason she came to point lookout was to collect people for her cult, and not a Plague. Some legends are saying that she died only when the book was stolen from her, and she lived unnaturally long life. Here we get our first time to Dunwich inc. After the death of a husband Constance became very rich, apperently she had a brother, with his sister's money he builds Dunwich building in a capital wasteland, and in this location we can find a mysterious totem where cult was praying to their god. Also the fact that Krivbeknin enlarges your life is proven by the Mr. Blackhole, because his house is built in Victorian style,  which means it was built before the civil war, and the point lookout was the Confederate port back that, from journal entries we can find out that he was a Confederate himself, and that he is the only one from his genus! Also gases on the island are formed because during the civil war Confederates were burying soldiers bodies in the tunnels underground, and in the Blackhole house we can find a Confederate soldier uniform. Why does he need Krivbeknin?, easy Confederates were for slavery and he needed this book to controlling slaves. Also after expanding her cult Constance is ordering to start the project in the Commonwealth, which is later will be called Dunwich Borers.
---
This is what I have wright now, hope it will help you in your search for the truth :)
---
That you chose to pay actual money for a gun is your own problem; that‚Äôs just a silly thing to do, and I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs frowned upon from a legal standpoint as well. Not sure what you‚Äôre expecting to gain from this post, other than a handful of negative karma. Bethesda isn‚Äôt going to gasp and decide ‚Äúoh no, this guy paid $30 for his TSE, we should un-nerf them!‚Äù
---
Some of us do great without TSEs. The fact that some people are so reliant on them is ridiculous. Besides, you are still doing plenty of damage even with the nerf, from the sounds of it. 
---
Do you happen to have pack rat on? Because 587 accumulating to almost 200 pounds sounds like pack rat
---
A true politician sir.  Attack the definition  of a thing.
---
You make it sound like finding bugs is hard.  
---
All one has to do is play the game.  The bugs are right in your face.
---
But I agree with the gist of your post.
---
Only ~94% wrong
---
Yeah, that's why I'm trying to get rid of mine as well, the ammo for it is just a bitch to farm for, can maybe get enough to make 3 batches of ultracite .50 in the cranberry bog at a time during a nuke but that's it. Can't understand why we can't put the standard receiver back.
---
None of the weight perks carry over to your stash, they only work for items on your person. Which really sucks for junk but all makes sense if you think about it. 
---
Yups, just seen the plan there right now üòä
---
Because they have their place? because they _are_ viable for specific rolls? Because their ammo is light and can be used for minor pests you don't want to waste more expensive ammo on? 
---
Higher damage ammo weighs more and is more expensive. I run around with a thousand .44 and use my revolver to take out a lot of minor enemies, bugs, dogs, etc. 
---
And you're..flat out wrong? "side arms" do damage. Soldiers carry them in the real world. But they also carry rifles, because rifles are more accurate and do more damage, more reliably. 
---
Yeah, I didn't pay attention to the ammo type.
---
Once I realized what I did I was pretty bummed.
---
I don't get why guns do not give you the standard plans as default. I just make 10k rounds for the 50 cal before I upgraded too. Oh well.
---
Well shoot that makes the whole perk worthless to me
---
I retracted my earlier question about having pack rat on to say that perks on affect you.
---
You can have pack rat on, but that‚Äôll show you the weight AFTER being affected both in your inv and the stash. The stash only takes note of base stats, regardless of perks.
---
Say you had the ballistic ammo weight perk, and mini nukes. The perk may lower them to 3lbs, and the stash may show that too, but the stash will recognize it as 6lbs, and always that.
---
Is BGSAustin working on the game right now? I though normal BGS was doing support for now and content updates initially then shift it over to BGSAustin for long term support.
---
That's awesome dude. I'm glad it's still being appreciated fully by someone. :)
---
Well I politely disagree.. Make fallout great again
---
Instructions not clear. Shotgun got lost in river.
---
I've been locked for as long as a minute then DC'd only to log back in and find out I was killed during the "Server not responding", everything should be locked up not just the player.
---
Was a pleasure, thank you!
---
Have you found a Confederate kepi, yet?
---
Lack of patches? 5 in the past 2 months is a lack of patches?
---
As far as I can tell, the reduced-weight perks only change the weight of items you're carrying, not the items in your stash. However, when you look at your stash, it shows you the reduced weights, even though those don't apply to stashed items. So, something that weighs 2 lbs. in your stash might appear to weigh only 0.5 lbs., even though it's taking up 2 lbs. out of your stash's 600-lb. capacity.
---
If you want to see what the items in your stash *really* weigh--which can help you decide what needs to be dropped or sold--you have to temporarily disable your weight-reduction perks. I don't know if this is what was intended or not, but that's the way it works.
---
This!
---
I enjoy working Whitesprings as a team with others who are in the area. I am happy to just tag if there are more powerful players to take the ghouls out, or if I‚Äôm the stronger player, I‚Äôll kite the ghouls out to others and let them tag before finishing them off. I happily show the lower levels where they can stand and snipe from without getting hit. 
---
And I have no problem getting on the mic to warn turret campers that Whitesprings is no place for that nonsense. Everyone deserves the chance to tag, and turrets don‚Äôt allow that. 
---
I‚Äôd give it a go if they would clarify that I won‚Äôt lose my weapons....they were extremely vague on the stakes of that mode, something to the effect of ‚Äúcaps, junk, etc‚Äù. I won‚Äôt even log onto that server without knowing what I‚Äôm gonna drop when j get sniped by a Sneak Perk TSE Gauss Rifle hiding behind a tree outside my camp. 
---
A very country roads thing to say.
---
I tried crafting a couple dozen .50 and scrapping them and didn't get a single plan, i don't think it has anything more then the heavy barrel.
---
This is awesome!!! Thanks so much!!! I'll definitely look more into it!  =]]]
---
U got caps lmao
---
Good luck, wright if find something interesting.
---
The metal faces in your first link arent the same though, look at the robco one and the one right next to it. The nose is shaped different and the eyelids are at a different angle
---
Very few
---
Based on the state of the game and the mechanics changes in the recent updates, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that they've shifted all work on this turd to an offshore team of unpaid volunteer high school interns.
---
Yes it is when the game launched in this state
---
That's the thing. There's a time and a place for marketing (I was a business major, we had to study this stuff). 
---
Right now they are in trouble. They're losing users, and every bit of news about the game is bad. Normally games sell once and that's that, but this is an online only game so their expected revenue also includes microtransactions via that Atom Store. So losing people now is even worse. 
---
They need to fix this asap and that means hyping new content and fixes asap. They announced PVP and bungled a patch and that set off this exodus. So if they had ANYTHING lined up, they'd announce it. 
---
Also remember, this isn't the Fallout 4 or Skyrim dev team. This is Bethesda Austin. The main team developed both of those games and planned out the DLC in advance. 
---
Bethesda Austin didn't think far enough ahead to put a text chat feature in an online game. 
---
I think you are right. I must have made 30 or 40 by now.
---
From what I read there are no mods to get except the ultracite the the barrel. 
---
That's why i'm looking for a new 50 cal.
---
I think they are old mutants looking for a ticket in the Falhalla
---
Patch every glitch that made playable then leave. Shouldv just left carry weight and stash glitch alone. Everyone I know that played left after that was fixed cas game is boring now
---
And there patches caused more problems than they fixed....so how many patches have actually helped
---
I think that the scorchbeast are attracted to them, but did not make them. They mutated from bats, and they still exhibit some bat like qualities. Mainly they like to stay in underground caverns until forced out by overpopulation. Most bat species that the scorchbeasts could've mutated from are cave dwellers. So while we see scorchbeasts out and about, we never see where they go while they are either not screeching at us or underground. I think that the they are being attracted to these alcoves because they emit something related to that old god horror, who is supposed to be locked away. In lovecraftin mythos some old gods have relations to the "deep places" as they are imprisoned underground. I think the scorchbeasts are being attracted to these places and nesting there because of Ug-Qualoth. 
---
&gt;  use the assets of Fo76 to get a running start of FO5 and pretend Fo76 never happened.  
---
After this disaster, I'll be surprised if we see a FO5. At least from this company.
---
Well hang tight, unfortunately it sounds like all we‚Äôre gonna yet from the DLC Vaults all over the map are dungeons....I mean, I‚Äôll still play the shit out of them but I was hoping for more impact out of them opening 
---
Wait... you... you didn‚Äôt seriously *pay* for a TSE did you...?
---
slow clap
---
Agreed, even on my 2nd Nuke Launch....the silo was just flat out tedious 
---
We'll see
---
The *country* roads*
---
It sure as hell scales with something.
---
I was three percent short of putting up all of the neon letters I desired. I waited several more levels and changed nothing else. The space slowly appeared.
---
I wonder if this could have anything to do with the cult of the Mothman. I don't know his mythos in the game as well, but in folklore he is supposed to show up as an omen to warn of a great disaster. I read that the cult summoned him to warn people of the Great War. Mothman is still around 25 years after the war, which begs the question. Is there another disaster waiting for us?
---
Offer 750 caps. GT GrumpyDude 
---
You're cracking me up with these posts.
---
Thanks, everyone! Appreciated!
---
In a sense, we're introducing a new mechanic to mob/monster behavior by suggesting this. Glowing-mutant mobs will need some rules to how mutations should be distributed per mob family or even by region, but let's see where we can go with this.
---
Introducing regional mutations for where said mobs are can make for some interesting encounters (and maybe a more efficient means of hunting mutations or serum components down the road). For example, a glowing mutant hound from the Savage Divide has an increased chance of having damage reflection and resistance mutations versus a glowing mutant hound from Cranberry Bog who has a higher chance of damage buffing mutations. 
---
On top of that, giving legendary glowing mobs an additional mutation on top of it with a higher chance of having more mutations the more stars the legendary has. Should make for some really challenging, fun and oddball encounters. Marsupial/speed-demon/unstable-isotope/plague-walker ghouls inside a nuke zone anyone?
---
Ultimately, I would like to see something like these implemented. It would make for more varried and interesting encounters with patrolling packs of mobs for one. But its also a good method for introducing old and new mutations to the community in the wilds and nuke zones of Appalachia rather than waiting to get something by sitting in a pool of toxic water.
---
That was great. I actually took mine off. Never thought of posting. Well done my friend. 
---
Yes, I completely agree. I have effectively stopped playing for the same reason. Sometimes I think "wow, I'd love to play Fallout 76" but then I remember that my stash box is full and I absolutely do not feel like spending most of the game continually trying to figure out what I need to drop.
---
What platform? I have a T60 paint.
---
&gt; At this point, Atomic shop is the only thing funding the bandwidth and server uptime.  
---
Is it though? I can't imagine *anybody* actually spending money to purchase anything offered in the Atomic shop. 
---
Really now...? I was confused why I was able to find more than one. I had always assumed you grabbed one and went. 
---
That makes me feel like an informant who gave away a government secret for a candy bar.
---
Great post im layed up with a neck injury from work and I love poping in some times and just walk around looking for cool stuff.  Great post.
---
That's a strange way of saying "Yes, please."
---
"it's random" are the only true words I've seen on this topic.
---
I got my shielded plan and one of the T60 paints on the same turn-in of a single tech data, not more than my tenth or so.
---
I agree that the game plays much better on a new character than it did when I leveled my first. I'm still much more attached to my first character though. 
---
It could actually be a good sign. With all the bad press around 76, perhaps they didn‚Äôt want to take any chances with Blades and chose to take some more time to clean up any issues. 
---
No, make him huge and have him ridden by the meatlump king - sorry for the SWG ref there

20 hours from the most recent trade...though it could be from the most recent time you sell, because I very rarely buy without selling to get some of my caps back.
---
Personaly I think its fun.  Ya it has bugs but lately don't most games.  If you play with the right mind set its alot of fun and ive meet some really cool people its defiantly the least toxic online game ive played in a long time.  Glad your buddy is haveing fun with it.
---
Walk right through the foundations?
---
I started with a few people after convincing them and they just fell away. This was a week ago as I started then. But I found the Casual subreddit and there are tons of people to play with on their. 
---
u have my upvote kind soul. 
---
Watch no clip documentary. Why do people bother wasting their time speculating when they have access to factual information? 
---
Exactly how the game should be played. I destroyed a player canp cause he made his camp right next to the back of a building killing all the ghouls. I have mine at whitespring also but not interfering with players killing ghouls. I always see people using my camp for the benches, beds or even bringing ghouls and using my turrets to finish them off.

Fiddy cent.

Yeah I can also confirm it works like this.

Don't forget the adrenal reaction mutation, it stacks with bloodied weapons

Minecraft was not some huge megalithic game when it started. but the "best game of lego you will ever play" word of mouth spread and it eventually sparked off. (and is arguably responsible for early access like bethesda is arguably responsible for dlc) it ran on java for crying out load! I dont know if microsoft changed that or not after buying it up. I having played it in quite sometime.
---
just because we know somewhat reliably how many people owned it on ps4 at that point in time does not mean we can guess how many own it on pc or xbox1. while I would expect far more people to own it on PC it seems like (at least on this reddit) more people own the xbox version. unless you have hard numbers you are just guessing and your guesses will be colored by what you expect. you expect the game to fail so you believe it has sold less than 1,000,000 copies and everything that stems from that number. just on the name alone it would have sold more than that. Even without digital sales data fallout 76 [was the 4th highest selling game in November](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-first-month-sales-heres-how-the-game-d/1100-6464002/)
---
console patches work differently than pc patches. on pc if you need to change a bit of code you change the code, on console you have the change more than just that little bit. which is why pc updates are about 500MB while consoles are larger. that is with any game.
---
as for how to create your own story, you already said you don't want to but [here](https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/18/18146133/fallout-76-player-satellitejedi-raid-boss-pvp) is an example.
---
as for the game keeping an audience, that is something we can only wait and see if it can do. WoW has been losing steam since WotLK but it is still there. Minecraft is not a huge as it was. all games lose their audience. the real question is can it last long enough to pull in a new one. if enough fresh blood is circulating in there isnt much worry about retention.
---
Can we let them fix some damn bugs first before we have them spend their time programming human/npc hybrids?!  G‚Äôdamn! :p
---
Damn!  My PC level 104 character would throw a few down with ya!  My XB1 character is only level 5.  Fuck it. Im coming for a drink!
---

---
It could work wonderfully and perfectly as you said since it only has one option for progression! Though in all seriousness they could make it to where the party could argue over plot choices. Fallout 76 isn‚Äôt a terrible game it just isn‚Äôt a good game either. It sits right there in the middle.
---
I know this is a month old, but I came here just to make sure I wasn't going crazy. After about 3 hours of roaming and looting, I guess I didn't see any warning or anything on my screen, and when I finally went to go and fast travel home, a quest marker told me that my camp was under attack (I had never seen this pop up before, so I was a bit confused.) When I came home, every goddamn purifier was broken, every wall had a hole bust into it, and it was just a huge ruin. Luckily, that farming came in handy with the repairs lmao. I'm pretty sure that it was a player, but I really don't know for certain.
---
Be around tomorrow afternoon to make the exchange?
---
Take pacifist off.
---
r/whoosh
---
 &gt; What is this based on? Because so far you have done nothing but project your opinions on their actions without anything to support your statements other then wanting it to be true.
---
I've never made any claims that these were anything more than my opinions.
---
 &gt; And they have been listening to feed back about bug fixes and other issues. How do you think the TSE nerf happened? Literally reading social media posts about how bullshit over powered it is. And tracking how it was the only gun really being used. What they are doing now is branching out beyond just basic game bug fixes and trying to improve or over haul entire sections of content to improve the over all game. An over haul to events or new mobs with new mechanics is that content so many people complain the game lacks any to do.
---
Well yeah, I mean now they are. Now that their game tanked and they have to. And their fixes are poor at best, and more often than not require their own fixing. My entire point is that they don't need it reiterated again. If they've been listening as you put it, we don't need them to ask again. Their TSE gun fix was myopic and fails to address the root issues. Which has been explained ad nauseam.
---
 &gt; So you don't even read my responds do you? Or are you so annoyed I'm talking sense your ego jumps in to purposefully misrepresent everything I said to make you look less silly?
---
I read what you said.
---
 &gt; Your words dude. Your entire logic relies on everyone having the memory of a gold fish and not remembering all previous complaints because Bethesda started asking specific questions to deal with specific issues.
---
No, my words are indicating the intention. And if you think Bethesda thinks highly of your intelligence, you haven't been paying attention.
---
 &gt; They have asked for specific feed back about events and now mobs. As well as announcing looking into adjusting stuff like durability levels on energy weapons and reducing heavy weapon ammo to make the guns more viable because of feed back. How ever when you want specific questions like how to improve on events or what kind of mobs do you like and what kind of mobs do you see in the future. Asking questions for content over hauls is how they get detailed information without needing to swim though all the posts to find the few tid bits. You are ignoring these questions come about because of player feed back. One leads to the other not the other way around as you keep trying to insist.
---
Again, would have been awesome if they did that before launch. Apparently now we need to help them fix their mess.
---
 &gt; Runescape stuff 
---
Don't care.
---
 &gt; But you don't because there are two kinds of betas. Ones that are early builds of the game which is basically what early release is on steam and X box. And B.E.T.A that is basically a server stress test. How ever there was far more wrong with it during that and they were not set up to handle the sheer number of problems that ended up happening. Launch didn't help much either so they had to catch up on a lot of back logged issues.
---
Don't what? There is one kind of beta test. A beta test. Just because you bought into their marketing spin doesn't make it any less of a waste of time. It was a demo for preorders. Heck, there wasn't even a wipe. It was a glorified early access.
---
Only now that their game has the lowest score the company has ever experienced, are they putting forth a fraction of the effort they should have back when they had time to make a better first impression. Their ship is sinking and only now are they asking for advice on how to avoid icebergs.
---
There is no such thing as a "B.E.T.A.". It's just the lame marketing they gave their demo. It tested nothing but server capability. They knew their games was an unfinished, broken mess. Only now, two months after launch are they asking for things that people have been screaming in their collective face since their "beta".
---
My regret has always been getting the All Rise at level 40 and realizing its one of the best weapons. Redoing another character now. It‚Äôs actually nice as a more stuff makes sense and I didn‚Äôt connect those dots before in the storyline 
---
Mostly in the Mire.
---
Someone did a survey about this and a good majority stated that they wouldn't play it at all.
---
Might still be fine in terms of player base but still.

Hey can you check out my slideshow? I have been trying to reach you guys for awhile.

That's part of the reason I do so many Enclave quests; I can at least pretend I'm rebuilding the Enclave with MODUS.

I made a cheap trouble shooter set of equipment.  Walks you right through the silos.  Leather works well too

Hello, I have been trying to reach out to the bethesda team, but I have just not been able to. I have complied a plethora of creatures and ideas.  
---
I have found the plans to build one but they are glitched and you are not able to learn it.
---
Agreeeed dude
---
I lost a Unyielding weightless +strength bos combat chest piece due to the Feed the people glitched :( submitted a ticket and got nothing back.
---
Same my game crashed. R.I.P
---
You are so right, I mean ridiculously right but the people living on sad hopes are obviously gonna disagree. The down votes comes from those that are desperately clinging on to something that will never see the sights they dreamed of. I‚Äôm a fan of gaming first and fallout second. If they think this is a AAA game then we are on a very very slippery slope. Its sad but ignorance is utter bliss.
---
After level 50, there aren't a massive amount of things that challenge you. Aside from SBQ, it becomes pretty by-the-numbers.
---
I use to remember when I was real fearful of regular SBs where I would run and hide to try and avoid them. Now they're just annoying.
---
I love how so many of these posts are almost copy paste. Like a template is going around.
---
You do realize the inside the vaults are cumulative updates. As in one adds to the next to keep players informed about the goings on in the support team.
---
I don't know how or why people get the idea the updates some how represent the only thing being worked on.
---
Floating camps are worse, hands down. I'll be honest, it's a challenge not to turn ~~greifer~~ raider and break out the TSEs when I see one.
---
This is where they disappeared to
---
If you use recon scope corpses will be tagged 
---
Why can't I upvote this twice? Or even three times, because of the BOS mention but not true acknowledgement of such things...
---
You could at least attack one of those floating eye sores then. 
---
Got em.
---
Well, if they listened to everyone about the pricing, maybe they would make something from it. /shrug. They are not really paying much attention to the players now.
---
But what about mothman and the alien?
---
I legitimately can not tell if you are serious.  It seems over the top parody. Yet I've seen people legitimately use this logic before on here and r/fallout.
---
I've had a similar thought too. I want camps to be like camps - small, impromptu and mobile. I don't want to have to uproot my main base just to benefit from the camp's supposed mobility.
---
If they had C.A.M.P.s that had a much smaller budget but no cost to set (but auto packs away when you walk away from it like power armour) and H.O.M.E.s that have more budget but are considerably more costly to move, I'd be into that.
---
First map I've seen to have the workbenches. Thank you!!!
---
Bar would be perfect using sentinel armor just stand there serving drinks have a shotgun behind the bar
---
Legendary armor already leaves power armor in the dust, please don't nerf power armor.
---
It does have a large patch first update.
---
Which was my biggest concern when 76 was announced. 
---
A lot of the mob AI needs to be fixed up with fo76. With deathclaws specifically, I would like to see some more animations in addition to those AI tweaks so it can defend itself from attackers more effectively. The AI should mimic predatory habits of big cats (lions, tigers, jaguars, etc), which doesn't seem to be the case right now.
---
Tail swipes and body checks with high stagger chances for anyone in melee range will make them less prone to being damage sponges and force players to think on their feet (lets be honest, that's what a melee player is supposed to do). 
---
For ranged combat, deathclaws would have to be more aggressive head on and retreat if they can't close the distance. With some new animations you can have them climb up buildings (not crazy high, 3-6m should be enough to get the job done) to drop down on prey or even have them prone in high brush/grass and pounce on whatever dares to get close enough. 
---
Don‚Äôt drag them into this. What did they ever do to you?
---
I hit 100 and got it immediately.
---
I'd play it only if i get to steal people's stuff. I love stealing and being a raider
---
This is such winning advice. You‚Äôd be surprised.
---
I got it at exactly 100 on Xbox.
---
Was going to say, weeelll if that's what you're into okay? 
---
I started to write out a counterpoint, but this would actually make perception useful outside of rifle builds. I'm a heavy weapons user with 1 perception, so I'd have to really think about what I wanted to lose...
---
The sloths make me stupidly happy because our state fossil is the Jefferson's ground sloth.

As someone who is always ~500kg overweight I would love something like this as a way to travel anywhere while I am inactive 
---
It's a sight to behold but not one to use. 
---
Hum, i think they are the same. Look at the "circle" below. And that metal plate, with the bolts. The angle on the photo might be misleading, but I do think they are the same.
---
Bloodied Explosive 99% weight handmade just disappeared from inventory... didnt drop it, literally was inventory and then its gone...
---
I haven't been able to add anything to my camp in quite a while, nothing stored. It did seem like it increased early on, so maybe it stops increasing at level 50 or something. Though I did build a ton of stuff at a friend's camp who was level 5 and they still have some budget left, so I don't know. One way to test would be to build a bunch of turrets and store them. Then level up. If your budget goes up, then your stored percentage should go down. Alternatively, you cold have a low level character store a few turrets and a higher level character store the same amount and see if their stored percentages are the same. If the higher level character has a higher budget, then the same amount of turrets should take up less percentage for them.
---
When you equip it the accuracy of the gun goes up
---
Literally the only reason I currently play fo76 is because it's a fallout game and I like the world it's set in and all that stuff, but I'm a *huge* hoarder so that's my main gripe
---
Well honestly people have the right to be annoyed with everything. Frankly it never stops, they keep messing up the game. People could never get refunds. That plus the never ending perpetual state of broken really well doesn't work these days.
---
Fans of series also hate to see something get dragged through the mud, beaten and lit on fire. It's kinda what it feels like is happening. 
---
Am I the only one who clicked this thread expecting a timeline of what happened with the BoS, raiders, free states, etc etc as to when they fell apart based upon data compiled from terminals and holotapes, up to the opening of 76?
---
Damn xbox achievements seem like they work a little better than trophies do in other games as well
---
Odd given the name huh? You'd expect a daily to be around for 24 hours, regardless of how many times you log in.
---
Most people think it‚Äôs a bad game. Live with it, sad but true. Just Google. Ignorance is bliss. Opinions are like arseholes but even the arseholes know this game is bad. Good luck you deluded fool lol.
---
Were you on Xbox, PS4, or pc
---
From a base of 52 ish to 70 something
---
Why does everyone act like Anthem strongholds are the only endgame? It is more like Diablo.... Do anything you want and get rewarded... Strongholds don't even seem like the focus of the endgame at all.
---
That was well worth the time it took to read it. 
---
Im coming with another dude
---
Awesome I‚Äôm at my camp now
---
The cult of the mothman has everything to do with it! I actually think it's the same cult, or the same entity. The mothman shrines can also be found inside the cavern of the Interloper, so I guess they are pretty much the same! =]
---
Not surprised. I played the game basically three times through and was bored out of my mind from how little content there was. Even now people are dropping like flies because of such little content.
---
You've finished the main quest and all of the 3-4 side quests, what now? Well we could launch a nuke ~again~, or raid the mines ~again~, or go do these dailies I've done numerous times ~again~...see the pattern?
---
You guys are gods
---
What's ur PSN?
---
Maybe your the pied piper of mole rats.  Lol.  Known bug.  I‚Äôve seen it in some bug list post.   
---
Between the suits of power armour, fusion generators, sentry bots and power plants, there really isn't much need to extend their life. You're better off getting something that'll reduce their weight and carry more of them.
---
I've had a armor piece that was -20% on weapon weights. I don't really know where it was lost. 
---
Mama dolce eats probably many things, but I have been always aware of that and careful, not spamming the food parts into it.
---
Never later I've found a second weapon weight armor. I've brought few others but most other weight effects are also created by perks and they don't fully stack. While there is no generic weapon weight reduction perk.
---
In crafting I once accidentally recycled my responder police uniform. I really loved it and have not used anything past it. I do have one on my second char so I might be able to transfer it, but as I don't really have any e-friends so I've passed it so far.
---
But the biggest and most common thing to lose, is all your junk you are carrying. Ignoring PvPs coming for easy kills, you can also lose it to server when you die several times, the marker is only showing your last place, and you can lose the initial first death stash by either timer or possbly it may despawn when you collect your last death junk. Just on my last session, I lost a great deal of adrehesive and steel. It wasn't much, maybe 30&amp;100, but it's much when you have none, as I just few days ago brought my first ever TSE and I need to craft them to unlock better receivers and silencer for it.
---
Another thing that was really bad, I lost maybe 50, probably 60-80 of techncal data due to the way the quest allows you only to carry one. I still lose few of them as the game still don't allow to carry more than one. But that's okay compared to the one time loss of all I've collected.
---
Imahlum123
---
this game is dead and has been since its arrival if you guys pay attention. Sorry for your wasted $100
---
I have to say, as someone who is a massive Elder Scrolls fan, the disasters around FO76 have made me *extremely* wary about ESVI.  The *last* thing I want them to do is to try to hit a "tight deadline" for ESVI...they did that with FO76 and look what happened.  For The Nine's sake, don't try to hit an arbitrary deadline for a game that's still years away from launch.  Two years, three years, four years, whatever, just work on it till the game is ready.  I'd rather do yet another playthrough of Morrowind or Oblivion to tide me over for a good game, than get excited over a game that turns out to be a rushed, half-baked mess like FO76.
---
The bases are the same for all the heads but I think there are several different heads on the plaque.  You're probably right about them all being tied to the cult, and I would assume the leaders of Dunwich and Robco are part of that cult but they might also worship different Gods (like the female one)
---
Interesting. All of the cryptids get an explanation or can be explained. The Grafton monster, Wendigo, and the Snallygaster are all FEV or mutated humans they explain. (Wendigo might not be I'll have to check) and the flatwoods looks like a Zetan or an alien. But the Mothman is such a interesting concept they should go with.
---
Stay strong pony boys ‚úä
---
Imahlum123 
---
I would love to have a base, and then a camp.
---
We have been saying this among others since the get go. I wish they would do a weapons balance pass across the board. Fun weapons are in such a wierd place.
---
Nay I am merely a melee and this fist can stagger mountains 10/10 loved it.
---
I don‚Äôt know, but the lack of drops lately, there needs to be a place. 
---
It's not a joke? I'm sorry man... Really hard to tell.
---
&gt;We're talking about Bethesda backing up their own data that saves your inventory on the cloud internet- It might not get everything but at least people wouldn't lose their entire inventory of items like the OP did. 
---
How, exactly? 
---
The server and thus CS needs to have some log, some data, about what happened. You think they could restore randomly peoples stash and inventory to state 1-2 days prior, just on request? No gaming company intentionally dupes peoples inventories on request.
---
You are definitely, for sure, scrapping and not storing?
---
poor balance?
---
Did you know that your phone is probably cheaper now then when you got it too? Fuck those guys rite?
---
A bloodied explosive 90% weight handmade rifle just disappeared from my inventory, it was in my inventory one second and then it was gone. Occurred during some server instability, nothing else gone just that one weapon... very disappointing... makes it kinda hard to play the game...
---
Fucking ridiculous.
---
It's not the devs.  It's their management, i can 100% guarantee it.  Devs and techs want to solve problems, want to balance the game, and want to make the players happy.  If this was a real issue for Bethesda they would get out of their own way and give budget to the teams that need to make the game good.  
---
Maybe if it wasn‚Äôt weightless it wouldn‚Äôt fly away
---
Love it! Now please write the ‚ÄúBallad of Cheekclapper69‚Äù
---
Is it really a problem though? I throw out my fair share of spoiled food, but I‚Äôm never short on it. Even when looting bodies, I‚Äôll occasionally see meat and think, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt need the food, don‚Äôt need the weight.‚Äù
---
So you have a *tainted* soul then eh?
---
Probably like private lobbies for teams but I doubt single player 
---
Don't know exactly what armor your looking at if its lower level but combat heavy and marine out perform in almost every aspect except energy resist.
---
Survival mode is going to be added soon 
---
Absolutely. There rare now we need to come together on here and plan for efficiency 
---
If you craft and like it, ESO will hook you for a long time gathering motifs. 
---
Sneak!
---
Well, thank you, kind sir.
---
why wouldnt they? 
---
Bruh. No. Go do work like the rest of us
---
 I'm sitting on 15k caps because I work my ass off. Go do something.
---
Can't tell if troll throw away account or serious 
---
now i know this is your first post but you have to realize you dont have to buy anything in the shop plus theres not kid stuff in there sure some cutsie stuff but some people like that 
---
I launched 3 in the last 2 days at Whitesprings and Harpers Ferry. Every time I crashed, or disconnected from server when I fast traveled to my nuke zone.  I had friends on the same server and it kicked them too. So I dunno if Im bad luck or what. Lol. 
---
did you not have a princess bed growing up, OP?
---
Deep pocket heavy leather. You get 50 extra carry weight. 
---
same but just incase a dv in order
---
More salt and tears for my favorite lays chips it seems :) 
---
i put hot sauce in mine
---
I was level 165 and still did not get it to pop. (XB1) Ended up making a second character and leveling it up to 100, popped immediately. Just another big would be my guess.
---
Have fireproof on? If not put it on.
---
Dickhead don't get smart.you know I know that and it's not my point anyway.
---
Pretty sure passive mode also disables damage to workshop items, so it's a pretty simple fix. And it's allowed to happen because you might have to destroy items to take it over, for example I've seen people stack stash boxes as an improvised wall to completely block the workshop with no gaps. 
---
&gt;Deathclaws: Perfection.
---
Aren't deathclaws supposed to be scary? They're way, way, ***way*** undertuned. 
---
Any particular reason?
---
YouTube
---
Keypad doors, are they not destructivable?
---
Record it all just in case its hacks and you want to report them.
---
Don‚Äôt even do mama dolche. I have never been able to find all the canisters solo, only when at least one other player is present and contributes. Worst quest ever
---
It will make explosives tickle. Add dense mods on armor to make it even more like a gnat in your ear.
---
Listen hear dickhead dont get smart 
---
I would love to take you up on that if the OP passes. I'm in the same situation, and I play Fashion Fallout. (PSN: femiwhat)
---
No ...did you? .sure fucking want one now though since I missed out.how about a a dollhouse and some racecars?Or maybe an oversized diaper with a pin for all you adult babies playing this shite
---
I wonder if it's not a bug but purposely tied to fall damage or sprinting. 
---
Eh if your pc could be hacks but thats everyones answer more likely an exploit or the game is just that broken atm.
---
Bethesda would probably reply with, have you checked you ears at the doctor or buy a new headset.
---
Good thing we're talking about Apex and not Anthem which are two totally different games.
---
I wouldn't mind a diaper with a pin for my Faschnacht Man mask tbh
---
Serious
---
And I'm at the edge of the workshop in the woods, watching this guy through my scope. Standing up, moving around, and he's not on the map at all.
---
Also may want to remove name as theres a no witch hunting rule just saying also I can hide off the map just crouch.
---
Because practically every melee enemy tries swiping for the legs for some reason
---
What's there to fall for? Deposit your junk beforehand and you have nothing to lose. 
---
Ok cool. Do you remember if it was in the makeshift building with all the super mutant's or not? 
---
Nevermind, just re-read your comment 
---
It was better in fo4 in fo76 addictions are temporary, harder to get and stack.
---
It‚Äôs funny that your wife realized you didn‚Äôt enjoy it before you did. 
---
And fo76 has a bunch of fo4 assets, so they'd be layering asset flips on asset flips. 
---
1. PC -- Win 7 64, powerful rig
---
2. Wrayk
---
3. NA
---
4. Every time I switch to my legendary prime gatling laser and start shooting, I get only a few shots off and then it reloads, even if it has a full core -- been happening for at least a month now
---
5. NA
---
Because mobs tendens to attack the legs.
---
How much you willing to pay I have one.
---
The tricentennial edition has been $30 at Costco for a long time. I think it was $42 before Black Friday. 
---
I bought the power armor edition, so I also have some useless shit to put in my garage. 
---
I don't remember how much they cost but it was hard work hunting down Graham to find it.
---
 I want a 'pissing in the fissure' Photo Pose. ;)
---
work shops are pvp areas. no wanted lvls between you and him.
---
people want there to be more than there is in this game. They want there to be some secret ARG real story that will unlock the real game. So it's hard to admit none of this is anything, it's just a bunch of assets that already existed that they put minimal thought into as they decorated hundreds of relatively meaningless rooms. 
---
This guy deserves some love! Thanks for the power armor, appreciate it. 
---
Yes, I know crouching hides you, even when wanted, so I assumed he was just crouching until I watched him standing up running around the workshop. Then I shot my own generator once out of curiosity, and was instantly wanted. While I had the mission "Take back your workshop" active....
---
Oi don‚Äôt fucken play games with OP, he‚Äôs not in the mood for your shit alright 
---
sorry being a dickhead and smart is under my jon description also it seems like this game bad touched you
---
I know stealth is broken atm but didn't know if it could break like that also yeah that sounds a lot like the game is severly f****** ‚òù.
---
I have the plan for table lamps how much you offering for it?
---
Fuck those lvl 52 gutsies.  They myst have been excluded from the 2 shot nerf.  They chip a shit ton of HP off me. 
---
so scary im so scared rn
---
Maybe I think if it took an approach like rust or ark... but a TON of people will disagree, or if they have factions because I want factions a lot
---
Baziiing!!!!!
---
Yes I agree 
---
Bethesda?
---
Try after 200.

 There is certainly a fair amount of that in the game, but the OP is going to have to explain theirself since other armors are better in many things than leather.
---
I need to get the plans soon, I have a lvl 25 one and it‚Äôs really good 
---
In one of the containers - Berkeley Springs.
---
Ok, I wondered about that. So I can go claim someones workshop, then kill anyone who attempts to come reclaim it with no penalty? So why did he have slap protection on then? Still doesn't explain him being hidden on the map while un-cloaked and standing. And all the other fishy shit.
---
It‚Äôs a joke 
---
Man you always have to run around looking for him. He is always going agro on the the other bots. Then the other half of the time you can't find him after running around Watoga a few times he is glitched in the wall behind his counter. I kinda wish they would also do something about the Harper Ferry vendor too, go through kill everything close and as soon as you get in the trade menu with the vendor...BOOM enemies come out of now where and start attack me. So stop trading kill them get back in the trade menu again and now more enemies attacking. It is kind of a repeating action that get s old to the point I don't even bother going to Harpers Ferry anymore.
---
Thanks! Best laugh I have had all day!
---
I've had this happen on three occasions now log in and go to grab something that I'm selling and it's gone don't know what happened. Kinda pissed me off lost out on a 3k trade because of it. 
---
why is this not explained officially???
---
I guess we make our own story with the variables given
---
I don't mind the scorchbeast, I'll take on three at once. It's the annoying scorched that I could do with out. They are worst than the mole rats and need different sounds, the noises and screams they make have me to the point I want to mod a blank audio file over theirs.
---
I‚Äôd imagine both.
---
I would presume that some were born in the vault or shortly before. 
---
Strength for melee and heavy weps, perception for rifles, agility pistols and shot guns, intelligence to boost maybe energy weapons.
---
Do you care where on the map it is? Like, do you want it in the middle or do you just want a nice water land mix?
---
Vendor bot Greg in grafton sells the plan for 5700 caps. Follow the train track from grafton train station into grafton and he is in the building behind the Mika cola billboard. I am literally there now looking for raider power armor calibrated shocks but can‚Äôt find them. 
---
So you are a smart dickhead when you see whores? What relevance has that ? ( Not so smart can't spell). Yes... you will get more bile and vitriol than you can handle trying to bait me so just agree already and be done with it or try defend babies again to an antinatalist
---
Yeah, it was my favorite weapon with the adrenal reaction mutation. Kinda contemplating quitting, its like whats the point if my equipment can just disappear 
---
Come on! Get to the choppa! Do it!
---
 I like the idea of having a base C.A.M.P. as we have it now and a mobile version that is simply a tent to sleep in, a campfire to cook at and a simple CAMP device that can repair weapons and armor (no PA stations), scrap junk and act as a stash.   No crafting or upgrading, only repairs. 
---
I feel ya maybe just take a break and come back after an update or two. 
---
&gt;You are saying that it scrapped bulk scrap that was in your stash?
---
Of course it did not. He took all of his stuff from the stash, into his inventory, and scrapped it. That scrapped all his bulked junk too.
---
The only thing that weights more in non-bulked state is lead and aluminium.(in stash, where perks don't effect)
---
Lead is best stored as ammo.
---
Hahaha TSE goodtimes....
---
The hell is wrong with you, go earn that shit yourself.  
---
You know I am all for new bosses and encounters, but I wish they would actually fix the other problems first. I have so many atom challenges that won't complete. The camp bugs that don't place things properly. Learning all these plans found on random spawn encounters then not being able to craft them because they don't show up up in the crafting menu. They broken events that either never start or start and fail no matter what. I would love to have new content just as I am sure many others would too but fixing the issues already there and the ones they rebreak or add in with every patch need to be addressed in a more timely manner. It is just frustrating. And some many repeated complaints about the same problems over and over without any real results.
---
This joke did not woosh for you. 
---
Interesting idea but this seems like an overly complex and unnessecary way to implement player markets. The benefit of this implementation over just a vendor you can place in the world or your camp seems very little
---
 
---
Yeah I dropped a hot $50 to play the BETA and boy was it a mess. But a really fun one :D my buddy paid $15 along with my $50 and we‚Äôre game sharing on Xbox. 
---
 A man with a lever action sniper and a Handmade for medium to short range can go far in the wasteland.  I love my AA handmade with a silencer and 85 rnd drum mag.  
---
Bang tango!!
---
I'm glad this post is getting attention. I've been wondering the same thing. I honestly haven't seen the vast majority of plans in the game. If this was their solution to randomized plans a vendors previously, I actually don't like it. I like the extremely random aspect, I just want to know certain plans aren't hidden to us depending on our level, and I think some plans could use a bump in their likeliness to be available.
---
Do distant thunder better off that way and line in the sand or turning in tech data.
---
hi!
---
may i ask, what containers can contain many items , so as to xfer?
---
thank you!
---
j
---
hey with modern technology, 55 isn't that old.  But as for best and brightest, interpret that how you will.
---
Some things like heavy combat are appearing but are not constant. I think I saw all three (not at the same time) in watoga's train station but not 100% certain.
---
I paid 80 CAD for the beta personally
---
I‚Äôll try doing the two events more...turned in a crashing-ass-load of tech, only BOS Shielded and t-60 paint
---
THIS, SO MUCH THIS!  
---
(Well, first I have to figure out where to get plans for a toilet. And a tub for that matter. But once I do? I NEED CLEAN!)
---
I have my camp over a stream in the Northeastern corner of the map, by some of the tree houses. Only occasionally gets attacked, and I can have a nice water purifier in the stream. Areas like that are great to check out.
---
Yeah I've heard outfits are more common with the data but almost everytime I've ever done dt I've gotten plans.
---
1. Check daily challenges
---
2. Do daily challenges
---
3. Check atomic shop
---
4. Join group doing scorchbeast queen farming 
---
5. Kill people / take care of workshop / do some events in between.
---
That's terrible sales for a triple A dev game especially one 4 months into its life span
---
Question.  If a person puts X amount of points into perk that makes cores lighter &amp; hoards a bunch..how is that a benefit over putting the same amount of points into the perk that makes them last longer &amp; carries less?  Or even goes somewhere in between w/ both cards?  If you're using about the same amount of perk points doesn't that kind of make it a wash? Am i missing something?  I've got 2 on weight reduction &amp; 1 on lifespan, am i wasting my time?
---
I could see if a person was going strong on energy weapons &amp; wanted all their ammo to be lighter that might be better for them over all, but from what I've personally seen &amp; read is that energy weapons suck &amp; nobody really wants to use them right now. 
---
But on the upside your breath is fresh right? Cured your halitosis? 
---
Ah the old switcharoo
---
That sucks. Sometimes I'm just walking around minding my own business and my character starts grunting and taking damage for no apparent reason. It drives me nuts. It's the first game I know of where bubblegum and nothing can hurt you. 
---
mistype btw i just saw it but you are serious which is funny anyway have a good day 
---
Perk that makes cores lighter also makes other energy ammo lighter. The one that makes cores last longer just affect only that.
---
They didnt make only robots around because of the  mechanics of nuking. Its been establshed by Bethseda since release that they did this solely to create an environment. An environment where every person you see is a player. Most people(including myself) see this as ineffective, as the pros of having real story NPCs far outweight the pros of creating a more "alone"atmosphere.
---
No, we're all the pretty, young twenty-somethings from the ad. Isn't it the best that we can smile and laugh in the face of all the death around us?
---
My char is about L100, I don‚Äôt have a reason to continue to level up if camp budget doesn‚Äôt increase.  Wish Betsheda would let us know how that‚Äôs calculated.
---
1. PS4
---
2. psn - hawkjrh2002
---
4. ‚ÄúFallout Forever‚Äù trophy glitched. Hit level 102 and it hasn‚Äôt popped yet. Trophy is for hitting level 100. Read online that it is a glitch for many other people and they had to make a new character to get it. 
---

---
I can kill anybody who owns workhop :) it is pvp place as guy above told you.
---
He have chameleon armor or mutation, thats why he is invisible. Everything you are talking about is legit.
---
Hey man the other day I crouched (I have chameleon mute and fear/stealth mode) to go take care of my son; came back twenty mins or so later I swear on my life I was permanently invisible for like 3 hours. I even QUIT THE GAME logged into a new server and was still invisible. I took video. No idea how it happened or how to reproduce it.
---
&gt;what I've personally seen &amp; read is that energy weapons suck &amp; nobody really wants to use them right now.
---
Now, maybe. Let's see if they actually get around to what they said and look at balancing energy weapons more.
---
The listed speed (from what I can tell) is for the animation, not the actual fire rate (at least, that's the only way it makes sense to me)
---
Yes. The concept was interesting for about a week but then I quickly realized Bethesda should've just stayed in their lane and made a proper FO5 instead.
---
SHOOT ME! RIGHT IN THE FACE!  CMON I WANT IT! SHOOT ME! BANG! Thank you!
---
Ty for the info...was I wrong that maps are a way to get pa Plans?  I did get Plans from time to time just no power armor ones
---
If only I could be so grossly incandescent. 
---
&gt;Rad Roaches: If a rad roach poses any form of threat to you something has gone terribly wrong.            
---
                  
---
Made me remember beginning FO1&amp;2, going against them with just a baseball bat.  They were scary at the time.
---
Uhm, so you think you are more adult than we are? With your childish internet attacking? Hah good one boi
---
You can I just think the chances are super small most ppl were testing hundreds of plans at a time and still got nothing or almost nothing.
---
Read my post above. I had it put me permanently stealth last weekend for 3 hours even through quitting the game and joining a new server it was insane. 
---
I always took those moments of random damage as if your dweller was "Tripping" .
---
Its determined from the number itself, send it to me and I'll tell ya 
---
Lol this is clever
---
What? Cmon leather is good only again energy. Balistic damage will wreck you like paper
---
LAMP
---
That whole railroad part over there is super high in rads 
---
Had that happen before to hemce why I said it probably was the game messing up mine only lasted bout 40mins though.
---
25 cAps
---
I have bought $20/month of Atoms to support the franchise.  
---
Something happened last patch I've had fireproof and dense since it got changed and last week I started getting one shot again like when bobbles were being duped. 
---
Bethesda‚Äôs been removing duped items from existence. You may not have been the one to dupe it, but the item still gets deleted to regulate the market
---
Haha. My dweller is an absolute clutz and a danger to herself then. She should have stayed in the vault. 
---
Hmm strange I don't put anything past this game being broke anymore haha still love it though
---
Ill give you 5 caps
---
Did u happen to go afk for a bit while crouched? This is something Bethesda needs to fix asap if it can be reproducible
---
This. 
---
I have a lvl 15 chameleon combat armor leg pice that I still use at 41. 
---
no not really, just a land and water mix. I forgot to say but I would like for it be mostly water but  a little bit of land
---
I had found him months ago when the game first came out and couldnt afford to buy anything he had.  Just found him again after server hopping for 90 minutes.  He spawned with Grahm right next to the barn by the tracks.  The first time he was in the field near by.  I did get some rare items however.  The nuka cola  and cookoo clocks and a clean version of some hat.  NO coat however.  Came back and killed one of his two eyebot guards and he then became hostile.  So dont do that.  One shot killed him and he had an interesting responder holotape.  Still trying to get that coat.  
---
Living in west virginia, i can tell you thag the ‚Äúbest and brightest‚Äù should have included at least 3 rocks and disabled cat. But i like to think our characters were born in there if you choose to make them less than 40 years old or so.
---
No I was crouching rapidly cause the effect didn't go off and then bam moved forward didn't come off removed the armor didn't come off I've submitted tickets about it since the beta.
---
So let me get this clear: If you initiate claiming another player's workbench, that automatically drops you both into PVP mode, you both lose your slap shield, and whoever kills the other claims the workshop, and can continue killing the person without them having a slap shield, but you gain one unless they get to the work bench and initiate PVP again??? Broken as all hell if that's how it works.
---
My friends bought it for 10$ on a key site. They still don't play it.
---
Whats better then, perf, stinging or the reload one? 
---
I had the same issue you as you unfortunately. It was a blessing in disguise I created a new character to go through the game and get to lvl 100 again and it was a blast. I‚Äôd recommend restarting it really makes you enjoy the game for what it is. I had tons of fun replaying the story and grind. And the best part I got the trophy when I hit lvl 100.
---
Same here I love it. There are two things that really frustrate me right now and that is every explosive encounter has been a crapshoot since last week (I PvP ALOT-as in sole source of caps and junk basically) and when you and a squaddie are wanted ND one hits or even plague walks near the other you have to quit the server and rejoin to be able to fast travel again. Even leaving team doesn't help. It just bugs out and says enemies are too close.
---
Lol go back in time and posit this to the FO4 team. Too late now.
---
  Lol I love the typo "Federal" Golfers.  It smacks of our current administration.
---
YES
---
Combined with Concentrated Fire, this Furious one is more like a 3-star.
---
I‚Äôm torn on this one too. I built a small 2x1 camp that I treat as a forward base when questing. But I also have it on a mode right now that makes me a good pile of caps....so I‚Äôm a bit torn on if I wanna even move it or not
---
Yeah I know its the damdest thing I even had a fight were I know for a fact the guy was running bloodied and unyielding tried to smack me down and did almost nothing tried to reproduce it with him but had minimal results don't really wanna post how it happened we were both very perplexed.
---
This is fascinating stuff as it's been a while since I have visited fo76 Reddit. Thanks for the update. 
---
I stopped playing a few months ago and sort of fell off this subreddit. Back then they would have downvoted your post into obscurity, and given you multiple hateful comments in the orocess. At that time the forum was filled with people literally "thanking Bethesda" and telling them to "not listen to the negative people and keep their heads up".
---
It's amazing how things have changed in just two months. It almost makes me want to reinstall the game and see what new things are screwed up! 
---
Shouldnt have ever been a thing at all. 
---
like a mini minigun for rifle builds.
---
Its the core weakness this game has now oof. Not even damn ghouls and  they wrote them all out.
---
Well i politely disagree with them being a waste of time. if you‚Äôre rich in resources then yes a fusion reactor is a fast way. I understand what you‚Äôre saying, however maybe just maybe other people aren‚Äôt And powering up a plant is a great way to save on those. Also plenty of cap stashes and junk to grab as you go. I can power up in 12 minutes which is good enough for me. I‚Äôm not playing this game for quick hoarding and server hopping like some others are. Immersion is important to me and may be for others as well. We can agree that the server stability is the biggest frustration. 
---
This is what it‚Äôs like to chew 5 gum?
---
200?
---
You want them to do all this for free? You‚Äôll be lucky if they do any of it, and if they do they‚Äôll expect you to pay a monthly subscription.
---
Ok, first of all. There‚Äôs an entire development team set aside specifically for fo76. There‚Äôs not just one Bethesda. 
---
Secondly, anyone that actually was going to get the new canvas bag was informed they‚Äôd have to wait 6 months or more for the replacement due to production. It sucks that it‚Äôs so long but it hasn‚Äôt even been 4 months yet.
---
Y‚Äôall ignorant people that have no idea how anything is actually set up are the ones ruining the community. 
---
I did the same, the second journey really helps you find yourself. Best of luck adventurer :)
---
Is there proof of this ? I find that very hard to believe 
---
Love it. I have 15 STR, 13 INT, and 8 AGI ‚Äî main heavies, secondary shotguns and energy weapons.
---
Jizzy Bois.....lol.
---
Nope, he can claim it by standing in green cicrle until he claim it.
---
From your question i can see, he just trigger claiming, this mark you both as pvp active, he kill you and becouse he left green circle, workshop is still your, so he can again trigger pvp by claiming.
---
He is using game mechanic exploiting way and griefing you probably.
---
Same, I‚Äôve only ever seen people on here sat scrapping can get you plans 
---
What a simple but ingenious solution. Take an upvote!
---
Heya! I play on PS4 and was just checking on my gun. It only goes up two points over the standard sights, from 47 to 49. Maybe our stats are different or something. 
---
My biggest problem with this sight is that it doesn‚Äôt allow us to actually aim down sights accurately. When aiming it‚Äôs pretty skewed pretty far left and that makes it impossible to aim with.
---
You can buy the Handmade plan at lvl15. And the rifle spawns near Top of the world, which is at early game progress. It feels rare because its plan didn't available for purchase when you above middle level before the patch. Now, it's easy to get for a price.
---
I see what you did! Your comment is pretty accurate.
---
The same quests events with stale rewards. I wish they would remove the missiles from the reward item for launching a nuke, I get tired of having to drop them. And the same plans and recipes over and over. They need to do a loot table that bases the rewards off of you personal Items used in the game with a lower chance of giving you something that you will have to throw on the ground. Or give each vendor their own cap limit and the ability to but plans and ammo. Also with they would give me a way to get rid of the undroppable items; I have 43 Hornwright Bunker card betas in my inventory that is a pain to scroll though to find something else plus all the multiple other key cards and what-nots you can't drop. At least make it where they either don't appear once you have one or make it where you can't pick it up again. And the nuke card weight should be less than a pound.
---
Thanks! I try to at least be entertaining!
---
How did they wrote ghouls out? I don't know if I ever saw anything about it in the game.
---
deathclaws you rate perfection!!!deathclaws are trash in this game. too easy to kill and no risk to running up to them anymore. nerfed into the ground IMO. in all other fallout games they where lizard Gods, avoid at all costs. this game there no more poweful than a stooba muutan.
---
Hey do you want to start a new story together if so add me on PSN at hawkjrh2002 anyone feel free to add me
---
Thanks! Liberal Arts education at work!
---
Xbox. I'm guessing you're on ps4.?
---
Yea
---
There seems to be just one combat armor plan available at any given time and it rotates through all three tiers.
---
There was a questline in the swamp where you find out a bunch where hunted down and the survivors ran off into the capitol wasteland to that museum.
---
Have you seen Gatling Gun Front Sight? While horribly useless it is beautiful!

Hunting rifle has armor piercing mods. Lever action doesn't. Hunting rifle is an option for Gunslinger. You don't have to invest too much on Perception to get armor piercing range attack capability. It provides versatile choices for every non rifle builds.
---
I see them all the time at the BOS vendor.
---
My theory is they moved on as soon as the game launched.  The ones we've been interacting with are bots and they report to the 3-5 people Bethesda keeps in the basement to make "changes" to this game to make it seem like they are working hard on it.  In actuality the poor patches have been their way of asking for help to escape their captivity.  The fact that a major patch was released as a previous version of the game lends credence to this...we're just not getting the message clearly.
---
Or there is a team working on this and they are purposefully doing this as an experiment to see how much they can get away with before the fans/community crucify them all.
---
it's low cap/weight. Not efficient for collecting caps.
---
Are you CheekClapper69 or the Trader?
---
Only time I wear power armor is in nuke zones, and then only for the radiation resistance. 
---
Irrelevant, I simply am.  
---
You can just buy the plans from the Phoenix bot in Watoga now
---
I always thought of the material masses in watoga as scorchbeast nests haha
---
Omg yes. I haven't bothered to buy any outfits because what's the use if I can only be in power armor?
---
I'd love to have armor that could compete with power armor.
---
these updates are already promised, they've talked about it, and if you're talking about server host, if we can do it the same way MC Servers are hosted, they wouldn't have to pay for them.
---
You should only store a little bit of lead.
---
Rest you should use for ammo, because it's significantly lighter that way.
---
Best thing is to craft only valuable ammo, and buy any non-valuable ammo from other players who hopefully aren't crafting them either, but just collecting and using it.
---
The one that describes the process of turning into scorched is in the end of the Glass Cavern fyi.
---
Don‚Äôt know about getting it to 400 RoF but I‚Äôve seen people saying that Martial Artist helps the cranking speed.
---
I‚Äôm not in power armor, I‚Äôm in the Mire, covered in strangler vines and Mire mud, it was over for you before it even began 
---
I can't answer for the damage or lack of bounty.... But if he blocked you it would hide his map presence... not sure what else it does. 
---
Game mechanics wise, it's probably intented so you can sell it. This intent is not however clearly spelled out in the game and it's easy to believe its lighter that way.
---
Lead and aluminium are probably only lighter as bulk, because of mistake.
---
Nah, in my world , Vault Tec recruited early, my character went into 76 at 15, he came out at 40
---
Hard to spectate on stuff we dont work on but id like to contribute anyway.
---
Yes, items are stored server side to a cloud DB just like all character info. MMOs have to save this info server side, saving and reading it only locally is obviously a bad idea as one can modify it even with decent encryption. You also have to save character info in a cloud database for other players to see any information about you thats persistent(level, trading, dropping, etc)
---
Most MMO support teams have their own support system that interacts with the DB. Usually a custom software that has a search bar for any username and retrieves info and allows adding/deleting of item ids..take WoW for example. WoW customer service can restore items for players. When the agent responded saying they dont have the tools, this is what they mean, even at a lower level.
---
FO76 should be running a cloud db with adequately timed transaction logs, maybe 15mins-hour. Theoretically, it should be possible to look at previous stash data if truly the table was wiped but again, this information is likely not easily accessible if at all by their customer service team. Even if it was, extra work likely needs to be done on the data end to support a customer service team manipulating data. TLDR: they dont have a system that can support the adding or deleting of items. 
---
Haven't found double barreled shotgun plan since the patch, looked at all vendors.  Anyone seen it anywhere?
---
ya .what he said . send it to us and well check it out for you
---
None of the robots can pass through the hallway with the turrets next to it so if you can stay up there and snipe it, take advantage of grenades and stuff. Go for the legs, cripple it than go for the head and and disable the laser.
---
I find that specific assaultron the worst enemy in the game.
---
All soups go bad.
---
They all went and set up at r/fallout76filthycasuals, all 40 or so of them left.
---
I‚Äôll try that thanks! 
---
Maybe all this bad rep will mean that our next fallout will be another one from obsidian. New Vegas 2 perhaps... one can dream. Anyway, I don't see what all the hate is about, I have beaten every single fallout except tactics and BOS, I've played 1,2,3,NV,4 and now I'm level 47 in FO76. I actually like this game a lot. Although my biggest gripe is the lack of NPCs as the colorful cast of characters are what really made all the previous games come alive to me, especially in the 3D entries of the series. 
---
Honestly I had a lot more hate for Fallout 4 then I do for 76, they changed the whole formula around for that game, I felt like they catered to the casual gamers, the story was boring and every faction basically felt the same, they removed skills which really bothered me, the base building aspect of it was a really dumb idea for a single player game and just felt like a time sink to flesh the very short (compared to 3 and NV) game out and worst of all that mass effect style dialog wheel can never be forgiven in my mind. Fallout 4 is the only game in the series that I never felt any urge to replay, and most likely never will, at least until the Fallout 4 New Vegas mod gets finished and I'll be able to use the nicer engine to play a better game.
---
I also want to point out the "creature" in lucky hole mine near the stone faces is alive. You can see it twitch and also the Tesla gun arcs to it if you shoot it. Whatever these people were doing succeeded
---
On it boss
---
Perk cards for reducing carry weight only apply to things you're carrying, not stash 
---
Haven‚Äôt seen them since the patch. Might be gone to the wind.
---
the dev room
---
Yes. Aim gun with sight, blast away, hit nothing.  Ignore the sight.
---
I wonder is people are going to get tired of posting the same exact post with minor detail changes over and over and over and over. Just leave quietly ffs
---
I believe I've seen them in the watoga and harpers ferry area.  
---
Most armor and weapon mods that had a random chance at showing up at vendors no longer appear since patch 5. You'll have to find them in the world from drops or static spawn locations now.
---
PSA, you can still learn it from scrapping. I dont know if/where you can still buy the Plans :-( 
---
Can't learn a mod through scrapping that has a plan. The learn chance for any mod that has a plan is zero. For BoS material mod for Combat Armor Arms, Legs, and Torso you'll have to find the plans in the wild or buy them from someone. Since patch 5 most armor and weapon mods that had a chance at showing up at vendors no longer appear there.
---
I will not even bother with dailies that require multiple steps, like the listen to the animals one or hunt these 3 types of critter, I've been burned too many times getting 2 of 3 done only to have the server dump me, tossing all that effort out the window.
---
I did 175 treasure maps this week (all of mine since BETA) and only got like 5x of each Motion-Assist Servos for T-45/T-51b/T-60, and no part plans. Treasure Maps are junk. Distant Thunder can generate some part plans.
---
*Crunch Crunch*
---
Oooh yeah I've known about that glitch it's easily reproducible if you don't have chameleon mutation (I do and would never use that glitch on purpose)
---
Seems unlikely. Can you provide a link to where they say that?
---
Its Austin (source) someone from Texas
---
https://discord.gg/6xT6aMZ
---
we might have the answer you're looking for
---
None of the vendors in the game sell the BoS plans, I checked. Grrrr...
---
Yeah I purposely don't wear my chameleon stuff cause of it as it ruins my immersion lol once I get a stealth suit then I can make it make some sense :)
---
Some people, of course not. Many people? The ‚Äúaverage‚Äù. 
---
Yes. That is very hard to believe.
---
I've scrapped over 200 pieces and I still couldn't get it.
---
I have martial artist and sadly no difference :(
---
Try going straight south of Lake Eloise there are multiple bodies of water you try there.

So we just let scorchbeast harass us until we find it?
---
from what I've been able to gather, it seems like the early alpha concepts were just fallout 4 but with a network frame, and a lotta of the systems resemble that (For example, the slap system which is just a jank version of the borderlands pvp system), and they didn't have enough time to rework the code from the ground up to actually suit what they were trying to do. 
---
It would be the Idiot Savant perk 2.0
---
Well done. I don't get it why Beth is making vendors in every station sell almost similar stuffs.
---
Except fallout 76 barely cost a buck to make since it's all just reused assets and stripped down game systems. ME:A for all the shit it gets and deserves at least was a pretty full game with lots of...npcs üôÑ
---
I wonder if people are going to get tired of commenting on people posting the exact same post with minor detail changes over and over and over and over. Just ignore the post ffs

Dude, fridge is whole new level of rocket science.

Odd, so there‚Äôs not much around it, if I start scraping stuff they‚Äôll re-spawn? Have they ever disappeared for you afterwards? It‚Äôs on a blue house, the buildings next to the flat

Learn rate is low, I'm 320, quite literally throw nothing away without scrapping it, have a 29 in when scrapping and have not learned everything yet
---
Not me
---
Because of this issue. That's apparently not actually the case.
---
I think 76 will have far less of an impact on BGS moving than people think.  
---
I'm sure BGS fully expected 76 to be a roll of the dice, it was something new. It'd be a tad foolish to think they wouldn't consider that moving a single player IP to a multiplayer game to be a risk, and was likely a risk they could absorb if it went poorly.
---
It likely won't have much impact on ES whatsoever. Positive or negative. A single player ES game? That's bread and butter. People had massive gripes with Skyrim, and it was still a significant success. There's almost no risk releasing it, and there's no need to risk doing too much differently. 
---
I don't get where this idea that Fallout 76 not being a franchise best seller is somehow going to doom BGS or it's future projects. 
---
Apparently The way the Dev's configured the leveled lists overloads the Vendors, they are not capable of displaying "everything"
---
Wait...Is President Trump playing FO76?
---
Lol. 
---
I mean I've done it plenty of times so take a wild guess if I have that problem of finding them. I think only first time I struggled a bit with time, and partially enemies, when placing the canisters and later when reading the termnal and figuring out what to do. Plus there's few extras for each type.
---
The only stupid thing about the event is the enemies are really low level if you are high level. 
---
It's okay as then low-mid levels can join and not constantly get one shotted by high level enemies, and the area is more commonly populated by lower level players anyway.
---
Been doing this for a long time. I get stoned before I build, so it can take me hours or even days before I get to the garden portion of my house. Was sick of having all my food spoil before I built my garden and one day I noticed that once they are stored, they don't spoil. 
---
I agree with you but you do realise the irony of your post, right? 
---
Yup. I spent the last thirty minutes testing this. You can in fact drag someone into PVP by attempting to claim their workshop, then leaving it claimed half-way. Whenever you come back to reclaim the workshop, you have no slap shield, and they can just sit somewhere in stealth and one-shot you while they have damage reduction. Dirty, dirty exploit. Looks like being in PVP keeps them off your map, too. This needs a patch.

I have had that happen to me. Not sure what causes it, but if you could reproduce the glitch you could abuse the hell out of it...
---
Complaining about people complaining. Yea I get it. It‚Äôs like good god. Enough already. This subreddit use to be enjoyable to read now it‚Äôs like a symphony of whiners. I just hope Bethesda releases a decent patch this next one so people snap out of it.
---
And nobody cares that you don‚Äôt care. Same logic. If you don‚Äôt want to read those posts, don‚Äôt come here. Do you really think you‚Äôre going to have an impact on it? Are people going to read your post and say, ‚ÄúOk, I won‚Äôt post‚Äù? No. You‚Äôre contributing to the problem, as well. Just from the other side. I don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs so hard for people just to ignore a post they don‚Äôt like. 
---
And I‚Äôm not even one of the ‚Äúuninstallers‚Äù
---
The rate for plans, if you have an average seed for the RNG is very low.  
---
The thing the Dev's were supposed to fix (but it feels like we were mostly ignored) was tweaking the rate plans drop at, and correct the RNG / curve table, because again for most people, you'll get "Motion Assist Servos" way way too frequently.  
---
For distant thunder, since Beta, I've gotten mountains of motion assist servos, and 4 non-motion assist servos plans, in doing it several hundred times 
---
We can already cannibalize them
---
They are also going to use that backend to create the infrastructure for private server settings.  
---
Ensuring people who maintain private servers have the correct tools for their intended demographic is not wasted work hours.
---
I said this a while ago: When Zenimax gets its hands on something, nothing ever goes right. Fuck that whore of a corporation. I'm done with this game and will be joining the class action lawsuit. I hope they get what they deserve the sniveling cunts.
---
Yeah only armor that is "heavy" is the Heavy Leathers plans. I've tried Government Reqs,treasure maps and B.O.S events and RNG Jesus had forsaken me.
---
Pffft.

It's obviously a Xenomorph Queen situation.

I mean, we're even hopping into some form of robotic exoskeleton suit thingy.

So don't think of it as playing one of the worst Fallout games, but more like playing one of the best Aliens games....

Real fuckin original, I mean fuck, how many of these karma grab posts can their be? I just really dislike it when absolutely nothing gets added to the convo. No worries though r/Fallout has crept in enough that I finally unsubbed from here. No use seeing a circle jerk every time I log in.

1. Look at Reddit Posts

They should balance it by having only one fusion core for each power armor so you can only be in it for so long before having to charge it at a station

BS, I've lost legit dropped items and PowerArmor I've crafted 
---
To the east of whitesprings and north of the behemoth in the lake is a little town around a lake. In the town are various crafting benches as well as one for power armor (as well as a power armor spawn point). Can also find various other things (shishkebab, magazines, etc) around the small town. There is also a safe  (lvl3) on the next to the bridge on the side of the lake you can camp on. Makes for a convenient spot to whitesprings/blackwater, and artillery is great for the surrounding area from this spot. Had my base there for a long time.

What's funny is the "Enclave have a huge surplus warehouse in the background and yet they have the fewest items. Gave up on Calibrated shocks for the X-01 and with the Broken Scorchbeast Queen we are f*cked till Bedthesda updates and fixes it but breaks something else in the process 
---
If you are only seeing it when you look in certain directions, it is likely a lighting bug from a source really far away. I see them too from time to time in the ash heap.

I've got it reported as a bug on the "Power Armor" page.  
---
[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup - Power Armor - Feb 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amsncf/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_power/)  
---
Still trying to run down the cause, but I assume it's a curve table that's out of wack
---
So I just want to confirm that you're openly admitting that you plan on abusing Reddit's voting systems to purposefully negatively impact a sub and the reason for the sub? 
---
I'm fairly certain that will result in a Reddit ban 
---
Also, metacritic is useless
---
I don't see much point in locking the doors anyway, anything that can be stolen from(crops, purifiers, extractors, etc.) are almost always outside anyway.
---
Good god I think the point has been made. Can we have a bit more constructive conversations. It doesn‚Äôt seem like they hate the game if they are going out of their way to make post about it. Let‚Äôs move on and if their are still people out there believing it can be salvaged then let‚Äôs try to salvage it. If you hate the game then go play something else. It‚Äôs simple. There‚Äôs is some good to the game and I personally want it continue to be developed. Can we make a subreddit of the subreddit where people can talk about it and one where people can complain?
---
Just a heads up, they are still not working for me...
---
There is a stealth glitch that's apparently still in game it doesn't work if you have chameleon mutation(which I do) so there are at least 2 ways to get permanently invisibility then.
---
The problem is they seem to have an issue in the QA process, and I'm not sure they are actively playing the game, just enacting changes.   
---
The list bit has been reported, along with other stuff, we will see what happens
---
Because it gets to the point where there is literally nothing but ‚ÄúThis sux I‚Äôm out suckas,‚Äù ‚Äúyou all wasted your money‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm leaving.‚Äù 
---
It would be nice to have a sub where people who enjoy the game still can not get bombarded with a wall of those posts. But I guess you could ignore the first 30 posts on the sub everyday?
---
Some are probably paid to be here.
---
FO76 was definitely a small side project that got way over advertised and blown out of proportion. I refuse to believe this was supposed to be a dinky little side game meant to fill time until their next big release
---
For me it‚Äôs less about the actual fact of the quests coming from dead people and bots, it‚Äôs the result of that: nothing we do has any impact on anyone, since there‚Äôs no one to be impacted. So it makes the quests kinda pointless overall. 
---
It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt enjoy them, I do. They just have hollow endings because you did all this stuff and nothing happened. 
---
You could (and maybe should) argue that they‚Äôre quests of discovery and that‚Äôs fair. I guess... there‚Äôs just something that didn‚Äôt quite click in the execution. 
---
It‚Äôs not a major thing for me but it‚Äôs noticeable. 
---
Kk good to know ty 4 the info
---
It‚Äôs not impossible. ESO does it fine and many other games 
---
That‚Äôs sad if it‚Äôs true but maybe it is. Not sure who would pay someone to go talk about what a crappy game they uninstalled non stop. Lol
---
The Ms Nanny quest is like the only one where the person might actually be alive! 
---
The gattling gun is a nail driver though. I'll keep my dry erase cross hair as long as it's the most accurate gun in the game!
---
I‚Äôd love to get a response or hear it‚Äôs something the development team is working on. Also guilds or clans of some sort would be great. I think if they add those elements right now it would bring so much to the game that‚Äôs lacking. 
---
Also equipping the short barrel makes the gun heavier and increases accuracy. In what galaxy does this make sense? 
---
That's what happens when you spam the drop button in the junk menu oddly enough lol.
---
Have the steel series as well, and ran into that problem when I un-installed the base sound card drivers.  
---
Resolved when I installed the SteelSeries software in its place, now everything is perfect.  
---
**TL:DR**

Make sure you have audio processing software installed, be it the software for the  onboard audio device or software from headset' website

There are mirelurk queens too.

I am sorry, friend, but all video games are binary and thus inherently insensitive.   This problem won‚Äôt be solved until we return to analog video games.   Or buff TSE.

The discord I'm in has completely cycled its original group of dedicated players to a new set of extremely casual players that walk around and get amazed by finding screws. Everyone just got bored and left.

Eastern Regional Penitentry has an exercise yard in the middle of it with a full set of exercise weights, but none of the exercise weights can be picked up and scrapped for lead. Really upset me too because it cost a lot of bullets to kill all the muties
---
The worst of this is that they most likely had a friend or two waiting nearby to kill you if you turned pacifist off to retaliate.
---
How does this hurt the game though 
---
Pretty much all the criticisms about BSG over 76 apply to wildcard, who are scummy as hell too.
---
There was some greatness in the concept of ark that resulted in fun moments but it was mostly an unbalanced, myopic mess - it deserved better than Wildcard. I wish both would just sell off the IP‚Äôs to better companies.
---
The only thing I think wildcard deserves credit for over 76 is ambition - ark was always that and 76, well, they think 24 player multiplayer is the height of ambition.
---
I‚Äôd love for more true ‚Äúnew enemies‚Äù but I‚Äôd really like an enemy system like borderlands where the do, aesthetics and loot are scaled for higher power players so the fun,  cost and reward were all in line. 
---
I started since launch and still only lvl40, sniper build. Looking for ammo takes forever and does not help leveling.
---
So bonus tip = go melee for fast farm
---
I would drop server if I had a giant chicken flying over my head, but not until after I blew everything up around me with a double barreled shotgun screaming "DID YOU SEE THE SIZE OF THAT CHICKEN?"
---
What makes you think people can't dupe items on pvp servers too.
---
Don't be so melodramatic, Starfield and The Elder Scrolls VI are coming after this game.
---
It'd be like 8 years before we see Fallout 5, that's plenty of time for the wounds this game caused to heal.
---
1) We don't censor people. As long as it is at least somewhat constructive, it's allowed. We aren't making this sub into certain other infamous gaming subs. 
---
2) Yes, most of our subreddits have different rulesets. If you actually looked into it, you'd see that. There's no reason to think we can't be unbiased about this whatsoever. 
---
I've seen what it looks like via the chat mod on PC. It's basically an in-game discord chat &amp; it's not pretty. I had to uninstall the mod because of how spammy and irrelevant the chat was. 
---
I'm for local chat with speech bubbles or notice boards for lfg or trading or player vendors you can visit their camp or central marketplace. Personally, not a world chat. 
---
A lot of people role play as Raiders, and the game was designed around the fact that camps are destructible.  There is even a perk card with multiple levels that solely increases damage to camp structures.  Someone could attack these, get a bounty, and have done no damage.
---
In my story its my parents that were smart when they went in. I was born in the vault and spent the next 20 odd years taking apart fans and practicing thumbs up and other emotive gestures. I was not the child my brilliant parents hoped for and they died bitter with little hope for the future.
---
Kill the scorchbeasts for their loot ...said no one ever
---
Explosions mostly.
---
All explosive attacks tend to be at ground level unless they hit you directly, this is grenades, missiles, sonic booms, molotovs, any weapon that has aoe is almost always going to damage your legs more than any other body part, 
---
this is especially true if like me you use jumping to create extra distance from explosions, or jump so the only thing the enemy can hit are your legs.
---
Do they spawn at particular factions or do you still have to check all factions?
---
I've noticed it a lot after the latest patch. Not just you. 
---
I preordered my copy: 60e.
---
One month later, I bought a copy for my cousins in one of those shady key sites: 21e.
---
I plan to buy a new copy to for mules to collect random legendaries. Atm: 16e.
---
I'm seriously considering to tell you "GO AWAY, WE DON'T CARE". Give me a reason not to.
---
Scortchbeast sonic waves only hit your Arms. So if you wanna be able to tank SB/SBQ, you need freshly repaired Arms. 
---
It‚Äôs like people blowing up YETIs and burning NFL gear, they already got your money if you really wanted to hurt them sell the it at the fraction of the cost and flood the market (see why they like digital copies) but I think part of the point, especially with gaming, is disappointment. It hurts so much worse when something you love falls short, and for the most part gamers have a tight community to express their feelings. There‚Äôs comfort in finding those of like mind, hence the success of social media. I for one enjoy the game, but it does have it‚Äôs issues. But this is a platform for people to vent and such, you may not agree with them but you can‚Äôt deny all of them. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, and you have valid points and some other do too... different points of view build knowledge, like minded views foster ignorance more often than not on both sides... to each their own, but imma keep playin the shit outta it
---
As long as the snakes aren't like in far cry, sounds good. 
---
And there's no guarantee *any* heavy combat armor plan will appear. Classic patch.
---
All I know is they are screwed if they don‚Äôt continue it in earnest.
---
Todd flat out claimed it would be running for a decade plus with constant updates.
---
They said private servers would eventually come.
---
They made a lot of video recorded promises in non-bending wordage that makes it so they can‚Äôt scrap 76 for at least 4 years without  the customer base being able to retaliate big time, and/or getting a massive additional wave of backlash that will effect Ky destroy the company.
---
Obsidian is poised to make a better game than fallout,  square is soon to drop another defining massive rpg in the coming years...again!
---
The elder scrolls is that last best hope for them now, if 6 fails, or is even lack luster, Bethesda will never recover... and 76 getting more backlash with be the FNITC
---
The loudest opinions on this sub are geared toward not enjoying the idea of the pvp mode, but I've met people in the game that are really hyped for it and working really hard on their pvp builds.
---
&gt; **MOLE MINER:** ... Other than the Rocket Launcher ones I feel like these are in an okay place myself. 
---
I have one request for mole miners. They need a higher level variant so they can drop max level loot, since they currently cap out at L40 Glowing Mole Miners and thus only drop L35-40 items. Many areas in the game seem to pick one enemy type at random from a pool of some combination of mole miners, scorched, super mutants, and ghouls (i.e. at Top of the World is either super mutants, mole miners, or scorched while in Harper's Ferry is either super mutants, scorched, or ghouls). All of those enemies have L50-60+ variants that spawn for higher level characters except mole miners. Maybe bump glowing up to L50 and add in another lower level variant?
---
P.S. I really like that glowing mole miners commonly drop glowing meat since glowing meat steaks vendor well, but that's also really creepy. We don't eat ghoul or super mutant steaks...
---
How "wee of a fee" much are we talking? Selling a kidney fee?
---
Ps4 - got it on 100 with first build. 
---
Cannot get code hacker acheivement though and have done about 75 of them
---
I think OP is right. We are talking about a game in a serious state yet if you read the credits it lists far more people in 'QA' roles than any other aspect if it's development - yet look at the state it released, and remains to be, in.
---
1) log in in front of the Enclave
---
2) get to the vendor
---
3) cry

4) log off

6) rinse and repeat

7) lose sanity

The geth do not infiltrate... intentionally
---
The problem is that it‚Äôs not just the bugs and lack of content (mmos always lack content, it‚Äôs the nature of the thing). 
---
It‚Äôs that the game and it‚Äôs systems are poorly designed and balanced. Everything from the damage/armor system that gimps most of the weapons, to pure rng legendary lotto for reward and unbalanced, wacky PvP and enemies is just poorly conceived and executed.
---
Squashing the bugs and technical limitations is just the beginning of making the game actually good - good enough to relaunch. And the progress 3 months in shows no indication that it‚Äôs on a reasonable trend line. 
---
I held out hope that BSG would dig in, really commit their resources to fixing this and in 6 months it would be a stable, balanced and mechanically interesting game.
---
But it‚Äôs pretty clear it‚Äôs not going to happen. 
---
It's sad to see people desperatly wanting to play a multiplayer game with no story and NPC solo or with just a friend or two. Grinding for weapons in a public server is like wasting months of your life just for braging rights for weapons that you can easily obtain with a inventory hack.
---
You forgot to put "repair weapons" for about a dozen gives in there.
---
Are you talking about the farm?
---
I‚Äôve seen people do complete 180‚Äôs from defending the game to hating the direction in which the game is heading. Won‚Äôt take you long to follow suit.
---
There‚Äôs an extra 0 at the end of it, it should say 40. 
---
If this is a big concern you could try the subscription option. You can sub with premier for $15/month and play a week early, or the much cheaper basic and try a 10 hour trial on the 15th. You won't own the game but if it blows you away with how good it is you could always buy it when the sub expires or re-sub and continue where you left off.
---
I found an iron deposit and built a compound around it, there's 5 structures all connected by defensive walls but you could use foundations if you want it indestructible. I have a security checkpoint, a garage with most of my crafting benches, A little guardpost, generator housing with a master kill switch for power to the compound and a living quarters with instruments, couches, beds, and the cooking station. Not as much room for decorations as I would've liked but if you find a better setup and are able to make a more compact compound you could maximise your decorum
---
They already can, just try doing the Whitespring run without Adamantium Skeleton perk. Most people retaliated by wearing power armor, though.
---
Shout out to the fanboys yelling at everyone that gave fo76 bad review following by saying: dont worry, its kind of early access, it will be better.
---
The problems are two fold
---
Enemies in general have way too much armor
---
Enemies in general have higher energy resistance than armor across the board
---
These two problems combine such that even though the Shisk has very good paper dps, and would be effective against low armor enemies or ones with weakness to one or the other type of damage, there are no enemies in this game that fall into those categories. 
---
If Beth added enemies that weapons other than the super sledge could actually kill reasonably well then more weapons could actually be usable. 
---
Currently on a level 68 Stealth build here, strength is only 4. Working well for me, I was in a SBQ fight a couple of days ago &amp; didn't  actually die when I expected I would. Didn't do much damage to the queen compared to heavy weapons guys but took down plenty of the swarming beasties.
---
Try dropping all your items till you are unencumbered and see if it let's you move
---
I'm yet to see anyone play as a raider that wasn't just out to grief someone with the aim to completely level out someone's base
---
Look at it from a different perspective to reduce frustration.
---
Treasure maps have a very low chance to spawn the plans you seek and you will find that different regions are more likely to yield different PA plans (Cranberry Bog T-60, Mire T-51b, Savage Divide Raider...) however you get a ton of weapons/armor to scrap for 'unlocks', including some that are truly expensive to craft and fairly unusual to get as mob loot like Radium, Gauss, Ultracite, Lever, Handmade etc - in my experience Mire and Cranberry Bog have the highest rate for 'rare' weapons - ammo, 'rare' chems like Calmex, Psychobuff/tats, and all this just by pointing to a mound and clicking.
---
I agree that the rate at what plans other than Ultra-Light Marine Torso/Limbs, Motion Assist Servos and Ivory Grips - depending on the region these are the lowest 'default' yield - are obtained should be tweaked not just in treasure maps but in every instance where plans are obtainable, specially now that you can just walk to a vendor and buy them instead - talk about trivialising overnight what some of us spent hundreds of hours accruing - but Treasure Maps are far from garbage, specially in a game where the toughest mob of them all for months could easily produce no loot whatsoever - either by spawning an empty container at the end of the fight or just by disconnects - and even now is significantly worse overall than the average Uranium Fever &gt; Monster Mash &gt; Census Violence &gt; AWOL Armaments loop which takes about the same time to complete on your own. 
---
Do lot for a $1000
---
You never could learn Dense from scrapping. Padded (the weaker version) you can learn though.
---
Dense does still show up at vendors as mods, although I don't think I've ever seen a dense combat armor mod. Lots of marine &amp; robot.

The one definite nice thing about broken glass is the ability to feed wires through it.

I can't pull up my pip boy to drop anything and scince my health is getting lowish my armor kicks in a boost strength and now that I am dehydrated that's stopping me from fast traveling.
---
Did you ever stop to think that is what raiders do?   This is literally an exploit that ruins the mechanics of the game for other players, if they ban for duping halloween candies but not this that is major hypocrisy 
---
Another sad wanderer missing his talk to NPC simulators not knowing how to have fun in a sandbox unless the main story spoonfeds it to him. Go away, maybe Preston needs your help.
---
The problem is the armor system is designed to have enemies at varied armor levels being vulnerable to different types of weapon, but Beth just gave all enemies the exact same degree of armor meaning there are one type of good weapon and all the rest suffer for no reason.
---
there should be enemies with 0 armor, and enemies with 50, and ones with 1000, and ones with 50,000, all having different amounts of health, making different weapons more or less powerful against different enemies, but instead we have 100-200 armor on everything, average of 175, meaning only a very narrow range of weapons are ideal.
---
Pure damage? Perf. And that‚Äôs usually all I care about. But if you feel like you need more ammo per clip, go stinging. Or if you have armor piercing perks and an anti-armor weapon, go reload or high magazine capacity (drum magazine on rifles), because at that point a perf mag is going to barely give you any more damage- damage reduction is multiplicative, meaning if you have say, -36% from Tank Killer, your enemy is reduced to 74% armor. Then do -50% from tank killer, your enemy now has 37% armor. Reduce that by 40% from a Perf mag and they‚Äôre at 22% armor. That‚Äôs only a 15% armor reduction from the total armor at that point, which gives you like 7% more damage? Not much. 
---
Waow dude.just waow ‚ù§Ô∏è

If you're on PC, I know all armor mods and can mod your chest piece to Dense if you'd like. IGN: jchamlin

Use third person and you'll see a little dot when aiming. It really sucks that we have to resort to a workaround for a $60 game from a huge company like Bethesda, but that's the workaround.
---
Sorry saw you said "can" are you in power armor? If not try "change appearance" 
---
This is an awesome theory, and it would make sense considering they are both enclave.
---
Hardly they can still try and destroy everything else in the base. Besides it's useful to make multilevel bases and it's far less game breaking than any other glitches out there 
---
They should just hire modders to fix it.

Super Mutants have West Tek.

Scorchbeasts have Glassed Caverns.
---
Mirelurks have Wendigo Cave.
---
Wendigos and Ghouls have Whitesprings.
---
Mole miners have Blackwater mine.
---
Not all "dungeons" need to have cave-like appearances, and some enemies are memorable due to their rare appearances (Flatwoods Monster and Mothmen came to mind)
---
Same. And let‚Äôs bw real, from the wonky level scaling to the stash limit to the shitty armor/damage system that makes half the weapons useless and makes melee dominate to not having a power armor alternative for non PA character types to legendary weapon lotto - it‚Äôs just a badly designed game.
---
Fixing the bugs and stability issues is only the beginning of fixing this sloppy mess. 
---
BSG would have to have pulled an all hands on deck to save this game, back burner starfield, etc... and really devote their resources to overhauling from the ground up.
---
Instead it seems like they have a skeleton crew. It‚Äôs juat not going to happen.
---
Oh that was a typo my bad sorry. I'm not in PA but I can go from 1st to 3rd person but it doesnt do anything
---
Only reason they won't do that is dupers.
---
What about the under armor liners?
---
Are you in power armor? I heard there is a glitch inside it were you can't move, so affected people have to play without it.
---
Well for my part I was under the mistaken idea that maps were how folks were getting helms n Arms etc for pa, but as far as maps themselves go I just like the fun factor...my wife‚Äôs favorite thing (not a big gamer) is to help me go on a treasure hunt, and I ve picked up quite a few armor mod plans I hadn‚Äôt learned from scrapping 
---
She's getting paid to parrot sweet nothings and placations on reddit. Multiple other users in this thread have done a perfect copy of what she does *for free*. Anyone that works in customer service ever has probably dealt with an angry customer at some point, she gets to do it behind a computer screen with plenty of time to construct a nice little PR statement. You dont envy a sweet job like that? 
---
Its been like that probably 2 patches ago its really annoying.
---
&gt; Hardly they can still try and destroy everything else in the base. Besides it's useful to make multilevel bases and it's far less game breaking than any other glitches out there
---
To you, to me it completely ruins the fun of a post apocalyptic world.  The whole PvE thing is a joke to me, and it is only on this subreddit that people think that the game should be all friendly.  
---
Oh I misunderstood what you said I'll give that a try 
---
I‚Äôll need to check what I need to do that (scrap wise)  but can do that as well
---
I mean bring up the menu from the map screen and click "change appearance"
---
Not in power armor
---
&gt; Legendary Scorched Cazador
---
[Here take this karma sir.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfwA79JwS6Q)
---
They won't be able to injure my hands to the point where I can't do damage. At the same time, I can injure them to such a state.
---
This is some revolutionary brilliant shit. I love this so much. Has any game ever made before ever had such a mechanic ? MP game I mean
---
Oh, I was thinking about them crippling your legs before ganging up on you.
---
I had a bug where when I load into the world and if I try to pull up my pipboy too fast before everything loads I can't move, but could still use the favorite wheel or the map and if I fast traveled still couldn't move. Maybe in a world you are in you could just wait for everything to load then try to move. Otherwise could try to die and respawn.
---
What if it ment that you had the same 600 lb limit to be shared between ALL characters you had? Would it be worth it then? Not trying to be a smarta**, just curious. 
---
The state it launched in isn't really relevant here. You said they couldn't care less, but cared enough to do 5 patches, and soon a 6th in  the 2 months its been out. How many patches are you expecting? Daily? Ok, so they split their patches in half. Frequenct isnt all that important either so long as the patches have substance worth while, and arguably they do. Sure they have introduced some new issues, but I think it is rather... stupid, to say they caused more problems than solved.
---
It let me go into the menu for it but when I exited I still couldn't move. I have a friend joining to try to kill me I hope it works.
---
Try killing a mob next to you then use his corpse as a container.
---
Trying to get killed right now
---
&gt;Does anyone else think the majority of the FO76 development team has already moved on to the next project, 
---
You mean voice actors arent creating new holotapes, texture artists aren't creating for new items and world objects, quest designers aren't making lots of new small events and stuff? 
---
You think this WoW in 2005??
---
&gt;just leaving a few stragglers to attempt to clean up what's left of this mess?
---
Hmm oh. Yeah, that must be the reason. Yeah totally.
---
Usually they have a consumable item to shout on the server. Could make it a atom store thing.
---
Well the Overseer was definitely a full grown adult (she broke off her engagement for Vault-Tec sometime after graduating VTU. But she also sounds quite old in her recordings... I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if all Dwellers are 50+ canonically, but my dude is pretty handsome and spry for a senior tbh 
---
Am I the only one who get pretty fast killed by Gutsy's gun? Even with PA, I spend more time spamming stimpack than firing at those ennemies... 
---
The problem is resolved!! I had a friend lead some enemies to me and they killed me because slap damage was taking to long. Thank you all for trying to help.
---
*note to self* dont get overencumbered at monster madh event. Good luck hope it works
---
From the wikis:  "The in-game given number gives the maximum cyclic number of shots/attacks per 10 seconds, without considering reloading.
---
This is internally derived from the weapons attack delay rating divided by its speed rating However, if a weapon is converted to automatic or bolt-action fire, the time between shots becomes derived purely from its speed and/or firing animation duration."
---
It did thanks for trying to help
---
Weird I remember when this noob was trying to steal my workshop he got wanted. I did have turrets so its possible he was shooting at them.
---
Ok good to know.  Guess I'll play without a torso piece.  Thanks.  
---
And if you don't like that he doesn't like what the other guy said....ah, never mind.
---
Gatling gun is so cool you gotta shoot it like a gangsta 
---
Not necessarily mistaken, just miscalculated.
---
In my case this took a couple of months and a lot of trades for maps then trading duplicated plans for the ones I was missing.
---
My main's 'seed' is meh and once again I fell prey to the 'sunk cost' fallacy.
---
Joke's on me on this one.
---
The invisible part to the map could be he blocked you. I notice some players name tags not showing and other players saying that is because they have higher perception or intelligence then me etc. One shotting you with explosive, he might have tse and every damage perk possible. If you turned passive mode on and tried recapturing and he still one shots you that would be weird. Still kinda weird he is going through your full assassin set. I have seen people take the scorchbeast queen with explosive weapons in less then 3 minutes or so, he might have similar build to them.
---
I got 98 ballistic and 277 loose screws with repairs incoming.  Hope it's enough.
---
You raise a valid point, but then where are all our children? if you read the terminals before leaving they tell of the first child being born. Alternatively if we are the children where did our parents go? It is the lack of consistency that I've come to expect from Fallout. In FO4 we are frozen for 200+ years and after a few weeks out of the cooler we can through the wasteland with impunity, with very few enemies able to do any real harm to us, we can handle and repair every type of gun and rebuild entire communities from scratch.    
---
  If you dig too deep you will fall out the bottom on this one.
---
Wow that is gross, this needs to get highlighted to the devs.
---
This game is shite
---
&gt; It hurts so much worse when something you love falls short, and for the most part gamers have a tight community to express their feelings.
---
Hard to say it fell short of expectations when people pretty much did nothing but complain from the moment the game was announced. Like, honestly, besides a few optimistic people saying "I'm going to be the merchant/raider/villain/whatever NPCs we are missing!" almost every post, tid bit, news, or piece of info about the game has been negative from the fallout subs. Hell even the beta which people loudly cried about not being a beta, rather early access (which it was) showed exactly what type of game to expect... How can people honestly say they had reason to believe the game would be something spectacular or something totally different from what BGS "promised them" (lmao) after all of that? 
---
Doesn't stealth boy let you run around stealthed?
---
Its same on normal armor for me  . Legs are halfways broken but arms &amp; chest barely scratched
---
After drinking many Nukas and collecting their CAPs, they ain't cheap!
---
Same as mine except i can disconnect and hop into different realities at will for my character
---
Probably the publisher/parent company outsourced to some PR/Marketing agency or something.
---
^ This is the answer to your issue.  Also, just for fun, the weight displayed even inside the stash is the one that factors your perk cards in (even though it doesn't apply in the stash) so it makes it crazy.
---
Good luck my friend. Don't make any mistakes
---
Yeah I'm surprised  at the downvotes.  Never thought in a primarily co-op game that so many people would be selfish.
---
I agree everything here except sloths definitely need higher spawns, I've never found one after about 75 hours
---
I almost want someone to make a mod that makes scorched cosmetically appear like raiders and enclave/bos in my client even if nobody else sees them.
---
No problem. Hopefully that is that last bug for you for awhile ü§û
---
We can make incredible armour and weapons but can't figure out how to fix a fridge or power an old one up with the fusion generators we can make from junk.    
---
Shoot his eyes, if he can't see you . . . 
---
Go for the eyes Boo!
---
Wonderful House.
---
A small price to pay for that bloody toothless smile.
---
Go to bead.
---
If you want to have a constructive conversation then have one. Not everyone is an articulate professional critic. If you don't like what somebody has to say don't read it. Stop trying to force your will on others.
---
There is a theory somewhere that the pinkish looking Miners are wearing Molerats skin and that's why they drop meat. By that logic the darker ones could just be wearing Glowing Molerats....ewwww.
---
This has been known since the NoClip Documentary. All of Bethesda Games Studios developed 76 with Austin being tasked with getting the engine online and doing post-release work. The issue is that Bethesda has poor QA/no beta testing. Once the game was technically finished they kind of ran back to their other projects, leaving Austin who was new to this to fix everything and finish up DLC content. Beyond that they also clearly haven't hired enough people to handle segments like Inside the Vault and general support for an online game.
---
Doubt that would be a thing or there would be more outcry posts from dupers and legit players that didn't know they bought duped stuff. Also, there is consumables duped and they can stack with legit stuff so that would be hard for Bethesda to delete.
---
When you lost the weapon did you try looking at the ground? Cause I remember killing a legendary ghoul in whitesprings and he had no legendary loot then I saw a handmade on the ground next to it picked it up was legendary and then the ghoul spawned the ammo for it. So, makes me wonder if people that lost stuff had it drop or go through the map lost to the void, etc.
---
Yeah the ones who say "I haven't had any issues whatsoever."
---
"White Knight is so convenient that it's almost essential, we should nerf it so people don't feel like they HAVE to use it." Yep, that's definitely the solution. I spent the entirety of levels 1-50 or so just MAKING NEW LEATHER ARMOR because I couldn't afford to fix anything, but yeah, the perk that fixed that is what needs to be nerfed. -.-
---
56 irl, 56 in the game. Got razorgrain for fiber, good to go.
---
In the meantime, I am unphased. I stopped using White Knight before the nerf and it has been a great junk sink.
---
The problem is, they won't admit to us it's all gone to shit, even if it has indeed all gone to shit.  Why would they?  The moment they made it *official* people would truly lose their minds, there would be calls for mass refunds, boycotts, maybe legal action.  We have all of that already but on a much smaller scale b/c there is always the chance that they are working on making it better (and maybe they are, who knows).  I'm just saying, telling the truth if the truth is bad, that's just not gonna happen in the gaming industry.
---
&gt; Check out the Fallout 4 calculations
---
No don't, because pretty much anyone playing both games should know they significantly improved the effect of penetration and criticals.
---
&gt;And they need to fix how explosive applies to shotguns, rather than the nerf to Two-Shot and Explosive.
---
True, it's amazing how they didn't do anything to how explosive work with shotguns, while doing their major TS and explosive nerfs. Makes me think they only listen to only some complains without looking more in-depth what's the actual cause and effect.
---
&gt; (It applies the full bonus explosive damage to EACH PELLET, rather than being divided among them.)
---
But is it significantly weaker now, because it doesn't apply the full damage of the weapon, only the explosive part. So for shotgun with like base damage of 100, that's only 20, times how many shells actually connect.
---
Also different weapons seem to have different explosive radius. My high damage revolver does barely some self-damage when fired at wall at minium range. While TSE radium rifle can severly hurt at much further range. Unless the lenght of weapon has significant portion on that. Two bullets vs. one don't explain the difference, and base damage of the revolver is quite higher.
---
make a doorway and close it with stacked metal boxes put them on a rug so you can move them all at once. better than key pads
---
Hmm Feed the People is actually feeding the people. That is obviously not working as intended. Nerf it!
---
It definitely was not duped, found it myself. Have not bought anything from anyone at all (play mostly solo)
---
Are you on xbox? This has happened to me multiple times. The only solution is fast travel or respawn by death. I once got stuck in whitesprings with this (overencumbered) so i waited for a nuke and the sweet release of nuclear death lol. I got front row seats for the nuke show tho
---
There is absolutely a difference in firing speed with and without Martial Artist.
---
It's definitely not 400+ rpm, but it is significantly different.
---
It wasn't a newly found item, it was something I've had for a bit, but no there was nothing on the ground, I stood there and searched my inventoryand all around it was at a workshop, while a server was being unstable.
---
I've got no issue with pvp it's just not for me 
---
I imagine the team doesn't have data on where players are since Events got a nerf and people rarely do them.
---
Most people roam around Whitespring Golf Course at any given time and move to SBQ once it spawns, and it isn't because Ghouls are interesting to fight: it's completely mindless, boring but guarantees Legendary equipment and Experience and that's what the rest of the map lacks. There needs to be a serious fix to the Legendary spawn rates everywhere else, especially the big Cryptids that soak bullets.
---
Yeah they aren't worth the ammo for the loot they drop. Here is a scorch lung and if ya lucky one Ultracite scrap. 
---
So that explains no pocketed combat armour mods too?
---
I somehow ended up with the PlayTime armor paint, wondering where I should turn myself in.
---
Interestingly enough people don't seem to grow bored of Whitespring's Golf Club. 
---
Yeah im on Xbox and I had to have a friend lead some robots to me to kill me
---
Well I hate listening to holotapes because I mostly play with no sound. When I am able to  play, my wife is working feom home and I am hard of hearing so I can't listen to them. The other times I am able to play she is asleep and if I turn up the volume it wakes her up. I can't play with headphones or earbuds since they seem to always be too loud and give me a migraine within minutes. Too many years of standing in front of large speakers for concerts. 
---
HA! We call it end game. That‚Äôs fucking gold
---
That's so bad it's good.
---
It's pretty easy on PS4, just open up the map and hit R1.
---
Bugthesda said reason for the price gouges was to quote "Enable more trade amongst players" guess that meant armor and anything else of worth. 
---
I know but this game is buggy just saying experience I had. Also, I did get my legendary super sledge replaced with a regular one I picked up in the favorite wheel and had to unfavorite both. But, I'm guessing you checked your inventory and your bloodied handmade is really gone.
---
I'm seeing the same thing, I had found 3 data, figured I'd 3 tries when I went, 1st try and I was done. Scratching my head I collected 2 more Data, or so I thought, I could only find 1 in my inventory and it also has the double diamond  quest item marker now, it did not before.
---
That's disappointing.  Thanks for the heads up! 
---
What I want to know is how haven't you or the other people here moved on yet? It's fucking sad that you guys are still here complaining non stop since day fucking 1. Sure in an ideal world the devs would care enough about their product to fix it, but this isn't an ideal world and this is the reality of video games in 2019 when it comes to many major companies. Push a broken game or unfinished game with features everyone hates and MAYBE fix it later. 
---
I should phrase this better. 
---
If someone reaches your workbench and pays caps to attempt claiming it, you and they are instantly considered by the game to be in PvP. If someone wants to grief you, they can abuse this to kill you without receiving a bounty. They may lose caps paying to initiate PvP this way, but they can bypass your slap shield, kill you, take your loot and mostly or more than make up for the caps loss. Then if you keep returning to try and reclaim the workshop, since you have a mini-mission to do so you have no slap shield, but they do. They can use this to one-shot farm you using Chameleon armor or the Chameleon mutation. 
---
What I am not sure about:  
---
Do they stay off your map normally after this, or was the guy using the "block" feature to hide himself on the map from me (He WAS eventually seen to be walking around un-crouched, and with no stealth field, without showing up on the map)? Before this, how was he maintaining his Chameleon while moving, or Stealth Boy for such a long period of time?
---
Only counter I can think of:
---
Encase your workbench so that it cannot be reached without someone breaking your walls or picking a lock. That will force them to be wanted, or give up when they realize they must become wanted if they try to grief you. 
---
I care. I want to see a quitting post for everyone. I want to see every person post here who has had enough and is uninstalling. At least they are contributing something. They are showing how many people are quitting. They are telling some reasons why they are quitting. What are you contributing. Absolutely nothing except "You're hurting my feelings. I want a safe space where only people who have the same opinion as me say all the things I want to hear."
---
Fallout 76 dragons are different than skyrim dragons in many ways. Yes, they obviously reused the attack script, but the scorchbeast model has a different skeleton than Skyrim dragons. They have two extra limbs. The wings do not function as legs while grounded. What does this mean? No Skyrim dragon animations could be used without heavy modifications. This is not to say that other assets weren't reused wholesale, just that the Skyrim Dragon argument isn't a good one because it is not completely accurate.
---
That‚Äôs what friends are for haha
---
Been grief'd. Hated it. Want PvE very much. 
---
Yes, because you can use a character as a mule to hold ur items which can hold up 1,750 weight plus your strength level and perk cards 
---
Best thing at this point would be them going legacy and giving the source code to modders and quit dev work, game is trash anyways.
---
Todd is also responsible for global warming.
---
Please buff DeathClaws. They are too easy to kill. Make them scary.
---
Good point. Where are all the qa people anyway?
---
They're rolling over in their graves.
---
Yes, it's a bummer with marathoner. For white knight - power patcher is the equivalent for power armor, so all good :) 
---
Most folks would've run for the hills; good on you to bear with it.
---
I do that all the time, mainly with hard bargain and lone wanderer and the ammosmith and white knight perks. 
---
The Outer Worlds! That's OUR last best hope!
---
Idk, I used only PA for nukes (because of radiation), other time I was always using regular armor and easily killing both players in PA and Monsters.
---
Hostile, but I feel your pain.
---
Not me, what?
---
But without melodrama, what would be the point of this sub?
---
Hahahaha it's only worth like 20 atoms as well, I made 40 atoms for taking a photo at night 
---
Which is why it's gotta be a skeleton crew. It's a cash grab, with the least amount of effort possible.
---
Obsidian is already making the next Fallout. The Outer Lands.
---
Silo strikes.
---
Just to prove a point, of course.
---
I play the same way but with the cannibal perk. There's food everywhere! Hate robots, can't eat 'em.
---
After 76, Starfield is literally doomed to failure. Elder Scrolls might survive, but I think 76 was a nail in the coffin for this once-great company. Why would anyone trust Bethesda with a new IP when they treated our beloved Fallout franchise like this? Having said that, I believe that 76 can still be turned around, but the damage has already been done.
---
We're the actual Vault 76.
---
And don't forget that ultracite explosive vent.
---
You're right. It makes perfect, logical sense.
---
It's not like I didn't get any enjoyment out of it. It was quite fun to about 35 or 40. So I wouldn't say "wasted".
---
It's Fallout. It's a precious commodity.
---
Yeah no npcs or any quests where choices matter and even no companions is def a bummer
---
1.9 million is very low for a Fallout game. Conan Exiles got 1.6 and that game is pretty terrible too. 
---
Lol, I wouldn't go that far, but it's a funny thought üòÜ
---
I switch traveling pharmacy for martial artist when fighting the queen. It definitely works and is a major rate of fire improvement for the gatling gun. 
---
Can't they do both?
---
I stand with you, my friend.
---
LOL tried posting the link but Reddit said no!
---
It's all over the place, right?
---
I don't need reward for 3years ingame, but i want other challenges to go for bigger counts.
---
I have most of them complete now, doing daily and weekly. 
---
terminate the experiment
---
And I seen like 5 minutes of it and it sucks. They paid all the top fortnight players to play it, and made a tournament for $50k to get people playing it. They paid to feature it. Just marketing BS same as usual.
---
It's not stupid to pay or opinions. Yours differs from mine - can't we all be brothers?
---
Too late.
---
u/Lothken get over here, you finally have someone to accurately give your word wall speech about respecting West Virginia, and the people from there, to.
---
Classic, didn't even try it and shit talking the game... You're just as bad as all the people that destroyed FO76 before the game even came out, and then Bethesda left it for dead
---
That'll be a sad day, because it COULD have been so much more.
---
Hey! Just because you primitive organisms chose to wear thin pieces of metal over your body doesn't mean you should pick on people with actual protection. So please don't do ANYTHING to my PA and just fix your own mess.
---
It's one of those games for me, I wouldn't even play it if it was free,
---
Polished turd. What exactly would that look like? üòÜ
---
Okay, so then not sure how you can just objectively say "it sucks". Whatever works for ya though. 
---
Heh, I like that theory too!
---
Thank you so much for this! 
---
Of course that is a subjective opinion.
---
Seems like they can't mentally understand this idea. Sucks that it just told off their backs.
---
&gt; Wrapped in chains and wearing only a loincloth, the suiciders appear to be disgraced members of the Commonwealth mutant community, forced to pay for their transgressions by carrying a miniature nuclear device against foes of the mutants.
---
Since you asked.
---
I want this as well
---
Sell it before it goes inert, it's worth 4-9x as much.
---
When I want my skin to have that flaking away freshness, I reach for Raditall Gum.  The gum that burns!
---
No, but for this game, I'm certain of it. They're literally giving the game away in places.
---
Yeah EA sucks with marketing. They can't do it without the "Wokeness" sleeping out like puss from a pimple. Now who do I pick black butch lesbian,black strong woman, black man or fat white guy who looks like he is a sex offender 
---
I've currently encountering the same problem. How did you mark every fallout file as "hey avast, it's not a virus you stupid super mutant!"?
---
How very level-headed of you.
---
The very first thing I bought in the atom store was the racecar bed. Clearly you are right, and no one wants anything silly, ever. :D
---
That's the hope. In practice, though? Less so.
---
To be fair, there are chickens. But I'm not sure what happened to the rest of the birds. More susceptible to the radiation, fallout, coal smoke, and chemical fumes in the area maybe?
---
This is what I don't understand. I know nothing about coding, but I still feel like I could change Sonic blast frequency on my lunch break.
---
It doesn't display as adrenaline anymore it's becoming your base DMG multiplier. Check your weapon DMG after each cycle. Enjoy üòÖ

There‚Äôs these brand new things that‚Äôve just been released called subtitles...

If Fallout, there are two categories of ghouls.  The default state is the 'ghoul', which is a ghoul with a personality. 'Feral Ghouls' are what happens when a ghoul succumbs to their condition and loses control, becoming little more than a predatory animal. The West Virginia of Fallout 76 only has Feral Ghouls. West Virginia was only lightly irradiated during the war. If there should be ghouls anywhere, it would be places like West Virginia. There are none. Feral Ghouls have become the default state of ghouls, because ghouls were 'wrote out'.
---
Lol oh my God you're right.
---
Ha there it is! "I'll share your thread with the dev team"! I love it lol that line never gets old.
---
True, but I've seen different weights when I log in, have a crash to desktop, and then log back in.
---
Your grammar 
---
Truth. Preach it, brother.
---
Way to give them a pass, buddy.
---
Maybe not a "good"one, but an "okay" one, for sure. I didn't say "copied wholesale". But reused the scripting behind it, for sure.
---
Would be nice, but I'd bet bottom dollar that we'll NEVER see mods opened up for this game.
---
You get 1 point per level for levels 2-50: 49 points.
---
You start with 1 point in each stat: 7 points.
---
Total: 56 points.
---
Talos? That sounds like something a communist would say.
---
I haven't been able to get any of them to work in fo76. 
---
Welcome to three days after launch.
---
&gt; best and brightest
---
Still, all our characters start with ‚Äû1‚Äú in INT 
---
Sweet. I'm hoping soon it gets its durability properly repaired.
---
If you want to get the Buttressed (best resists) mod for Marine armor you're gonna need a whole lot more Ballistic Fiber for crafting and scrapping.
---
I especially loved finding out that the "Execute" choice when engaging in PvP, if you have the Cannibal perk enabled, triggers the cannibalism animation instead of the normal execution animation. I don't know how I ate someone through their power armor but it sure was satisfying.
---
Go to bread
---
Yeah not sure why. I love killing time (and monsters) at the golf course.
---
Maybe because the scenery is so nice to look at while killing things.
---
Yes 1 star legendaries.
---
&gt; . Im pretty sure the main team is focused solely on that elder scrolls 6 
---
What do you mean by the "main team"?  FO76 is developped by Bethesda Austin (Battle Cry) -- nobody there works on ES6.
---
Yes, except Conan is awesome.
---
Well but if you look at the screenshot. I didn‚Äôt start with 1 point in luck so it‚Äôs complicated for me.
---
Don't go to that area. You get randomly hit with very high rads.
---
I found something similar with Nerd Rage. Not sure if I can say exactly how it works but I was messing around with Berserker legendary effect and lowering my health with rads to get Adrenal Reaction, to try and get the damage up, and then Nerd Rage if you equip the caard the damage goes up without adding to the defense lowing the Berserker, or something. Not really a noticeable difference on the Ultracite Laser I was experimenting on as it is very low damage to begin with but there is something there I think to get a little more out of it I think. But I could be wrong just something I kinda of vaguely noticed and recall.
---
Um you might want to double check the requirements there because your pc does not meet the minimum requirements
---
&gt; how much money we have spent
---
$60?  That's a meal for a couple of people.  Never paid for a meal you difdn't like?

Honestly the max lvl for weapons and armor is lvl 50, you've either built a character with perk cards spread too thin (you should focus on one or two combat styles) or you haven't collected any legendary weapons/armor that assist with your build... At lvl 50 you should be killing these enemies with 3 power melee attacks or no more than a clip of ammo
---
Doesn't sharing this transcript violate your NDA?
---
Sorry, haven't been paying attention to armor mods, only armor mod plans.
---
What specifically is not good enough?
---
It works most of the time. It might be responsible for an occasional client crash though. 
---
Same here. I looked like mad max for all those levels which is cool, but this issue needs to be addressed.
---
Yeah exit fallout and load back in.... Happens alot if you mass scrap items/turrets or duplicates that show when moving campsites
---
I'm getting this too, but only on my newest gaming machine running an i7 8700 and an M2 SSD. My i7 4770K does not freeze and my laptop I run the game sometimes with a 6440HQ and Radeon 370M running a 2017 driver (!), which is clearly way below the requirements, does not freeze. 
---
It is quite interesting how the freeze only happens when trying to consume items, but not any other times. I get this pretty rarely, maybe once per 6 hour gaming session and I was planning on limiting the CPU affinity to 4-6 threads only (the 8700 has 6 cores and 12 threads) and see if that helps.
---
I think the fundamental bug is in the scripting engine of the game, which is claimed to be multi-threaded for efficiency, but can lead to all sorts of race conditions (see the glitch about reequipping items quickly causing the calculation to become wrong) if done incorrectly and at worst, hangs.
---
Please get a copy of *The Mythical Man-Month* by Fred Brooks and *read* it before making any more project management suggestions.
---
&gt; is in financial trouble
---
You have to be fucking kidding me.
---
Yeah my after work unwind is Fallout 76 farming and The Division 1 loot farming. I came late to TD1 but catching up slowly.
---
The elusive classy gear hunt.
---
&gt; I like the game.
---
&gt; I mean I really like the gameI mean I really like the game
---
&gt; I really want to delete FO76 from my console 
---
What?  Why?
---
&gt; but at the same time I don‚Äôt.
---
I cannot see any logic in your posting.
---
Yeah great idea 
---
3 months*.  People have been racking a month onto this games lifespan since it was released jeez.
---
What I said can be read in FONV wiki(and I also remember this), where did you get your info?
---
Hey, I know the dollar is down and all bur EUR 55 is not USD 100.
---
If this works, I love you!
---
A great quote from a popular post last week:
---
 you are not the "average" player of this game. The fact is, the 170,000 people on this subreddit are not a representative sample of Fo76 players. This sub is a tiny, a teeny-tiny percent of everybody that plays the game. You all should know it. 
---
Lol nowadays when they say free dlc and updates I always suspect this . Star wars Battlefront 2, sea of thieves are few examples where content updates have been lackluster . Would pay 20$ for a proper expansion any day over these free update promises 
---
You can maybe just plant behind a locked door, kinda like a greenhouse........... It's the equivalent of not locking a water purifier or resource generator, why even have it? I 100% take all unlocked water and food because I see it as an offer, there's no perks or lvl preventing you from locking and securing your stuff. I leave one water purifier purposely unlocked for people who come across my camp.
---
I am addicted to TD1 at the moment. I played D3 quite a bit but it didn't keep me coming back for more after about 70h or so.
---
I‚Äôm bummed.  I‚Äôve gotten a ton of hours playing, so I guess I‚Äôve gotten my money‚Äôs worth.  I had fun, but the game in the end just feels like a Fallout 4 expansion that they didn‚Äôt bother doing much with the story and NPCs.
---
The game is clearly so rushed and based on my experience with other big name online games, it feels pretty dead and like very few people are working on it.  This game feels like it‚Äôs still in alpha like playing Star Citizen where there is a ton missing still.
---
I‚Äôve been pretty patient as I‚Äôve played since the ‚Äúbeta‚Äù and kept a positive outlook.  That is slipping away though.  I wish that they had just delayed the game and gotten it right.
---
If your post was sarcastic is sure was very unobviously so. I now managed to read the second paragraph and I don't think I could read the whole thing. It's not funny enough.
---
Amen. Freaking no one cares about "serious" PVP right now. When I want that I go play R6 Siege. I mean down the line, sure, could be fun. PVP survival with roleplay elements could be fun. But im much more about exploring the in-game lore and solving puzzles with other people... when I have time üò≠.
---
The fucked part for me is that by the time my current work project ends and I have some free time, no one will be playing this game. Come on BGS Austin, content before PVP!!!
---
I would guess Blades is being developed by Bethesda Montreal since that is their mobile game studio.
---
Do it, he might like it better:) Good reason not to would be the actual chance it will get better!  DONT give it away unless your buddy asks, not worth paying for a game twice like I did with No Man's Sky (which improved to the point it's a different game completely)
---
If this works I‚Äôm definitely going to kill a queen with 1 swing of a board 
---
I always just assumed we were firing the weapon "ghetto" style.  
---
Yeah that is weird. I am used to TD1 dailies and they work great.
---
I have made this point a number of times, once in my own post and commented on many others. The "Kill Players" will likely go to 760 after you get the 76 like most of the other ones do.    
---
My usual comment on the 7600 is one too many zero's on the left or a k missing from the right. I calculated at my current rate of play while unemployed it would take 6-7 years to get that 7600 hours, nearly double all other FO and Elder Scrolls games combined. If I am still playing this game it better be a 20 000 Atom reward.    
---
I played all of BETA and am just getting to 600 hrs.
---
You see how that comment is now hidden with -5 downvotes? Now, who would disagree with such a comment? Really?
---
Just make sure you don't pick them up all at once when you get the quest, or they will all become one. 
---
I suppose they might be safe in your stash.
---
Happens quite often on the cliffs facing cranberry bog. For some reason some of the lighting in this game persists through terrain.

It works, I forgot to add leaving server with remove this bonus. Yea it works as long as you stay on one server, if game crash or you get DC process need to be repeated.
---
Not my post. Yours. /S?

Just don't use it then, play the game.... Seriously get over youself, calm down and maybe take a nap

The plans for them are at the at Camden park or the respondoner in grafton

A good 1 shot switch

Cpu is 1ghz under the requirement
---
My friend and I every now and then talk about how weird it is that everyone is expecting tons of end game content for the game right now.  Literally any MMO I played at release had very little end game content.  End game content was *always* released in future patches.
---
Hell yes I want to see Wanamingo's make a return! They were really cool in Fallout 2.
---
And speaking of older Fallout games, Im going to use this opportunity to yet again ask that we bring back the Plasma Caster!
---
I‚Äôll quit this subreddit before I quit the game. All problems are conflated by the echo chamber, and if you complain they just say "ironic". I think you should do the same, and anyone else who enjoys the game. Just quit a subreddit if it‚Äôs unhealthy. 
---
My enjoyment of fallout has always been a personal thing, and the jabbering masses don‚Äôt impact that.
---
If she's still that age after all these years, there's REALLY a bigger question to be asked, especially considering how skilled she is at making an escape. Namely, is what she says actually true or is there some kind of manipulation going on here?
---
Can we have any sense of taste or aesthetic before we give suggestions?
---
Are you on PC? I'll build them for you for five violet flux per leg, its the only material for the I don't have.
---
Killed players stay on 76/76 as completed :( thats my problem
---
Or a whole lot of Treasure Maps and staring at mounds on the ground.
---
Ahh, I'm not pursuing that one so didn't realize that. Kinda sucks, maybe they will change that when the PvP specific starts.
---
Not sure I'd call it a farm but there are some veggies now that you mention it. It on top of the mountain just to the east of whitesprings station though. Look around the power station that's down at the bottom of the mountain and there should be some stairs and such that will lead you to the top of blackwater but also into the mountain area. Solomon's pond area but north
---
We need a BLOAT FLY BOSS 
---
Will it be available for xbox one someday???
---
I get a "can't find that page" from Imgur.you are *supposed* to start with 1 point in each stat. If you didn't, something is wrong.
---
Why does everyone resort to the crutch cry?
---
yeh i dont bother locking my water or junk..but i have 100+ plants and my budget is full lol
---
I thought we were the QA people.
---
I dont know about you, but I just pretend my Power Armor has a self-cleaning function..
---
Oh it works, IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM! I only run 2star Adrenaline and by the time I came out of west tek my Bloodied Lever was 1950 Damage, you sir are a genius!
---
This is misleading.
---
People like myself can fix simple things - a keyword missing here, a messed up levelled list there, a bad material path... You get the idea.
---
Talented modders can rebalance mechanics, introduce new and interesting mechanics, create new assets etc.
---
Groups of talented modders can create moderate to DLC sized content.
---
No modder can fix the network stack or improve code stability because that is not going to be exposed.
---
The latter needs quite a bit of work before it can be built upon and that Beth have to do themselves, no one else can do it. Not due to lack of knowledge - I am fairly certain the people behind the various script extenders, if they so willed, could have a good shot at it - but due to lack of access. 
---
I don‚Äôt get why you are trying to defend this so hard.  The game has a lot of great ideas and a great map.  The implementation was clearly rushed and incomplete.  The game would be a lot better with even a few actual living NPC‚Äôs.  They could be human, ghoul, super mutant, etc. but living.
---
We knew that there weren‚Äôt NPCs, but we didn‚Äôt know how much the game would be lacking.  I‚Äôll even buy into the convenient excuse of everyone being killed or scorched.  There would at least be a handful of survivors and it would make it all more interesting.
---
I found a free one at watoga :) Don't really need one since duh, but it was one of the few guns I don't have plans so I took it and dropped plenty of others from my inventory.
---
I wonder if assult rifle plans are sold anywhere because that's maybe the last normal gun I don't have, excluding big guns I haven't wanted to get.
---
Good. It'll serve them right. 
---
for me it seems to do that when i‚Äôve already harvested it on my first run around. it reappears but i think it might just be a visual bug

"hey the demolition expert is really doing its job...Lets fucking nerf it into a fissure site"

I was hoping for a buff for demolitions expert cause i recall fighting a mirelurk queen with my MIRV Daisycutter and it SURVIVED 
---
You don't learn any weapons from scrapping them, just mods.
---
Agree. 
---
5 millions sounds weak.
---
FO4 sold 12 milion copies on day 1, accord Bethesda.
---
https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-ships-12-million-copies-in-one-day-break/1100-6432277/
---
And I remember FO4 kept the high price for very long‚Ä¶ in Steam for sure.
---
Thought it shot 500 at normal?  Don‚Äôt know for sure, but good question.
---
The horrors......
---
I thought this was going to be a feature by now. Sadly they can‚Äôt even fix the weight bug. This game just doesn‚Äôt work...
---
Wow, you'd use non-legendary armor at that level?
---
You missed my point :)
---
Food supply isn't a problem. Im only talking about the opportunity to store Buff-Food for when you actually need and want to consume it. Where is a lot of fairly useable buff foods that give you a big AP boost, increased exp gain (10% from homemade cranberry sauce...), or bonus damage by increasing strength. This food is often made out of things you can't always obtain quickly (like Mirelurk Queen or Deathclaw meat) or plants you cant grown in your CAMP.
---
Ditto. I have only bought a few but can't even fit those in the budget if I want enough turrets. 
---
Kinda like stacking bobbleheads?
---
Good god that's an impressive undertaking. I hope someone implements something in there, would be awesome to see bigfoot.
---
Yeah thats fine... but is each mag mod 40% Armor Pen? 
---
I blame it more on just a rushed and unfinished product.  I think a lot would be better/different if this was actually tested and properly worked on.
---
The i7-6700HQ has Turbo Boost up to 3.5ghz, and even if it didn't it should still be more than enough for a game like this.
---
I thought about this prior to release when the backstory elements were made clear. Given that 76 hand picked the "best and brightest" that were available to them it's at least possible that there were a number of child prodigies sent into the vault.  
---
However, the game does give RPers an out with one of the Overseer's entries (which I will try to find and link to in a bit). On her terminal within the Vault there's an entry that reads as follows:
---
Reclamation day has arrived
---
"We counted down to midnight. I haven't heard everyone cheer like that since vault baby number one was born..."
---
 Therefore it is understood that there are an undisclosed number of children produced within the vault. Still, eugenics doesn't actually work, so there's no way to tell if the vault babies are going to be as smart as their parents. Which might explain my willingness to follow orders given by robots programmed by people who have been dead for at least 7 years (I'm pretty sure the latest date I've found on a terminal entry was '95).
---
Tried tweaking your settings to see if it still does it? 
---
I'm 29. To me my characters in games are an extension of who I am. So my character back story is I was 4 when she entered the vault with her parents. Those parents being brilliant people to be accepted in the vault. She then spent 25 years training to survive in a wasteland and is hence an unstoppable god among men. 
---
I am run 15 mutations so I play as if I am THE Super Mutant. Those green bastards have nothing on me.
---
Lol i suggested similar two months ago and was down voted to oblivion
---
For the hell of it i guess?
---
Yes.
---
Has always happened to me. Weird.
---
They're assumed to be rewards for an event in Helvetia that never pops, for whatever reason
---
I found both of mine for 200something, both came from Phoenix at Watoga shopping center. I world hopped 4 times before finding both.
---
No you don't need any express or duping just normal perk swapping, and by game design you swap at will.
---
Yeah. Does it to me. I have an i7 6770k , 16mb DDR4 &amp; a 1080
---
The red circle of a nuke only lasts a couple of hours. Afterwards, the plants and enemies remain irradiated, but there is no fallout radiation in the area. It will stay this way until the server crashes/closes. IMO I prefer going to nuke zones after the nuke is over. No one proactively goes there to farm so you have the place to yourself.
---
They might have to modify the barrels on it. The issue is that the plasma thrower barrel deals slightly less damage than the sniper barrel, but shoots in a continuous stream with exponentially more DPS and a clip size of 306 instead of 9.
---
Alright here‚Äôs a new pictures https://m.imgur.com/gallery/BpdQCjH
---
Sure it's not damaged beyond use??
---
Im sure its a somewhat joke. I also assume is for people to keep track of play time, i dont think you are ment to complete it.
---
I like it, i don't understand why other challenges like kill people with bounty stops at 76/76.
---
Yeah my left are aint there on the UI, but i got the piece on me not broken no problem. Just a visual glitch.
---
Wait what? I literally just learned BoS right after the patch since I was able to buy, craft and scrap a shitload of pieces. I noticed the leg stopped giving me mods, so crafted chest instead and unlocked a few more. 
---
We see the faces in the fallout 1. 
---
I've run into something similar on PS4.  If you load into the game and go into the Pip Boy before the game is done loading it will freeze you in place.  
---
Best option is not to open the PipBoy till everything loads, if you log in next to your camp that might be a second.  If you do open the Pip Boy and can, just wait a few minutes and it should pop up.  Alternatively, sign out and sign back in and don't open the pip boy this time.
---
IIRC the tape is where the bodies of Olivia and her mother are.  Maybe server jump and go back, see if that works?
---
Her DR scales with the number of people. I had my very first nuke recently, put on prime and we failed the event badly, like we needed another 15 minutes and I an additional 3k ammo on top of the 5k I already shot at her. Other times, she fells like in 5-10 minutes. Anti-armor ranged is my build but looks like other present players with bloodied/furious builds with possible mutations can appear to ease the fight considerably.
---
Nothing much, just drinking coke at my step dads grandmothers house
---
"So we should all just be negative, deconstructive and shout shit at the game and it's developers? Hell, if it somehow succeeds at some point we can always sneak back in."
---
When a company shits down your throat and calls it Christmas, you don't tell the bloody devs to "stay strong." Idiot.
---
Workshops are a pvp zone. Not an exploit. You agree to pvp within that zone when you capture the workshop for the first time.
---
I just wear my T60 calibrated legs on my X01 set instead. Personally I think the bright silver bolts on the knees of the X01 look kinda yucky.
---
+1
---
Hmm that's pretty high effort video as far as youtube videos usually go.
---
Yeah 100% cores are 500 rounds, 120% should be 650, not sure how you got 650 on 100% core, maybe some kind of glitch? 
---
I had it on my Excavator, my T51-b and my T-60. I just had to remove them in the end. Easily the best helmet mod but couldn't live with the constant blue screen crashes (PS4). Believe me It was a ridiculous amount of crashes too. It really is a shame and I hope it's something Bethesda fix sooner rather than later as it's an amazing mod but just wasn't worth the trade off of constant crashing. 
---
I'll reply to this post after taking a nap on my rocket car bed
---
If so many people hate creationism, why do y'all the troll forms just to talk acraqp about it?
---
\^ That's what you sound like.
---
You are the third person I've seen to come up with this asinine "argument." Stop it. It's fucking stupid.
---
I took the holotape of the fight from the body of the mother and I left. This was a lot of time ago. Now that I found of the final holotape, if I come back there, I will found it?
---
iv got some legendary chest and right arm but iv never found a left leg , infact i hardly ever find legendary armour any more , and even before i had the chest (all the arm does is make me go invisble ) i never noticed a need for it  
---
It is an exploit because he doesn't even fully capture it and if its a pvp zone how come I can't fight back because of passive mode. It disables passive mode shield but doesn't disable revenge or ability to damage them back. Also, its an exploit in that low level can farm higher levels to steal caps but if I kill them I barely get caps back and they were loser blocking me first to not be show on the map so they can always just run away with stolen caps.
---
Nice
---
because its a dumb joke. amazing how literally hundreds of people keep bitching about a silly joke.
---
Hehe. Exploits isn't just duping. Some people are really naive what an exploit is. Somebody the other day was saying just move your camp 2 inches and it will repair the damage to everything. They had no idea that was an exploit. It is a glitch/exploit though hehe. Not intended. Hey, everybody does some kind of glitch exploit, whether it's server hopping, or logging off and on to get extra carry weight with Excavator, and they don't even know it's actually exploiting, but it is by definition exploiting an "unintended" bug or glitch.
---
Usually a trail of dead Brahmin means a deathclaw would spawn for me
---
He can leave the capture area to kill you. You can fight back (have been on both ends of it before and can testify to that). If you dont want to pvp then dont engage in a pvp system I.e. workshops. Simple. No exploits at all, they are just doing exactly what the game allows for you and everyone else. 
---
The scene afterward was pretty grizzly.
---
Oh my god, you are fourth guy, who think i bitch about 7600hours.
---
Actualy i am sad, there is max of 76/76 killed players with bounty challenge.
---
And there is not another pvp challenge to track progress.
---
I believe so. However, he was doing it for a suspiciously long time (They have a time limit, even with the perk card that extends the time. I am also wondering why he would have used such a rare and expensive piece of equipment just for griefing.) and I watched him from long range through my scope when he was standing and walking around visible, yet he still wasn't appearing on the map. I don't think he was outright cheating, but he clearly was exploiting the game mechanics in an unfair manner.
---
I did, and it's trash, but why type it in here when every pro- is downvoted and everyone else gets easy upvotes? Too much work when nobody wants to hear your opinion :(
---
Hate to be the bearer of bad news but they patched it 
---
I see 1 in each stat.
---
IT JUST WORKS!
---
Because results.
---
I don't take workshops anymore (and before, only for the atomic challenge) for the exact same reason. You could be relatively lucky as they didn't use the "feature" of contesting your workshop, freely one-hit kill you and then cancel the contesting so you still own the workshop, then repeat the process.
---
I've encountered many slappers all around with knives. I usually lead them into mobs where they reveal their true weaponry (TSE/Bloodied) or onto tall places where I can jump off in PA and they usually can't. I once had an explosive gunner follow me around shooting at my feet in WS when he managed to almost kill himself by hitting the cars at the club.
---
now let's hope you're not one of the unlucky ones to get your equips removed for no reason at all or, god forbid, your entire stash.
---
or any of the many game-breaking bugs, really.
---
I think your being dense half capping a workshop to continuously kill someone isn't an exploit for their caps and junk lol. The system is meant to steal a workshop from other players not farm them forever. And if your passive mode you can't even damage them back and being killed right in front of turrets that won't fire back at him either.
---
Doesn't matter what part you scrap, you can get mods for any slot from any part. The Brotherhood of Steel you unlocked by scrapping was the material mod for the Combat Armor Helmet. The arms, legs, and torso BoS material mods unlock only by the corresponding plan 
---
Yeah it's not a problem, until it is. Until it happens at a moment when you just died and dropped a lot of junk, or you just did a silo and launched a nuke, or you just got the SBQ down to 20% health, etc. Then it's a big problem. Then you will care.
---
Bethesda should just remove it then it's working like that since day one
---
I was on your side until this trite post!
---
500 + 150% (30%) from level 1 power user perk.
---
So that's fine.
---
What I'm not getting is the 20% bonus from the overcharge. 
---
I was on a sever earlier today where the spawn timer seemed to be broken, nothing was respawning anywhere that I could tell, white springs included. Server hopped and Ghouls spawned normal there... 
---
500 + 150 (30%) from level 1 of power user. Level 3 actually doubles clip size on gatling lasers :)
---
Yeah, another fix for the list.  Once this info spreads it‚Äôll be like bobblehead stacking all over again.
---
I'm personally not against doing it. But in their minds you are exploiting an unintended bug/glitch/feature, etc.
---
The only thing done to ghouls in white springs was to fix the bug that was giving mondo XP, they still spawn just fine. 
---
The "big" announcement recently to fix the loot of SBQ somewhere in the future says it all. 
---
A hotfix which is implementable within a day would be the only appropriate response. Still hasn't happened for how long the community has been complaining about it?
---
Don't give me this "coming" and "we hear you" and "what do you want for future content" for the x time. It's just silly. How old are you?
---
/r/falloutfilthycasuals
---
Yep enjoying my new alt. Level 10 now.
---
Personally, I love how in fallout 4 those mutant squads with the "KILL LOOT RETURN" notes almost always consists 50% of suiciders.
---
You might not think it makes sense, but it totally makes super mutant sense.
---
Yea. My pass came in the form of a refund and making sure people know this game is shit weeks ago. Clearly that passed right through some peoples heads though. What kind of dumb shit just went through your head to make you think I was giving them a pass? Telling people who constantly cry to stop crying isn't giving a pass to anyone. My statement wasn't focused towards the company or meant to give them a pass. It was focused towards the people constantly bitching over the same fucking things for months. Sounds like insanity to me. Sorry it wasn't everything we hoped it would be. I can definitely see how someone who thinks I just gave them a pass would still be here crying the same song since day 1. Not very bright are ya? Never meant to come here and insult you, but I don't know what else there is to say other than you should use your brain a bit. Hopefully you will take that as a form of encouragement. Maybe move on yourself or if you choose to stay at least see it for what it is. 
---
I'm not dense but thankyiu for your opinion of me. 
---
It simple. If you dont want to pvp then dont capture workshops. If you want to sit in pacifist mode that's your choice, but dint complain when you get killed in a pvp zone you agreed to enter. 
---
And as for them "farming you for caps" simply dont retaliate. Leave server, leave the area. There are plenty of options to avoid this game mechanic. Complaining on reddit about a non existant exploit is not the answer. 
---
That's just my opinion though.
---
Fixed in patch 3 or 4.
---
But not in luck?
---
Haven't lost my entire stash...just an entire session of stash...even what I put in my stash box. Have gotten my equips removed, stuck in power armor, died everytime I logged in, have pieces of my camp that are not moveable, weapons that do no damage, unable to use mics, and a quite a few more in my wander through  the wasteland. I really don't care. I just love the game. 
---
Well...I'm playing again üòÜ it's a love/hate relationship. 
---
What about people that are using it without knowing about it? I discover it by accident as I'm using perk load out manager and constantly swapping for weight reduction perks to fast travel and I noticed that longer I play more DMG I do it's why I started investigating what's going on üòÖ
---
Giant... player characters? *Puts pinky on lip*
---
It's still an exploit dewd...
---
Don't worry. We paid $60 to beta test. It's all good. Enjoy the bugs and glitches.
---
This is a day one complaint. It would be much easier to just select on/off events.
---
Scorched with elements from their factions should be a thing, like wearing ragged responder clothes or ragged scribe outfit along with a weapon type that fits their faction. Lasers &amp; heavy for BoS. Pipes &amp; exotics for raider. 10mm, hunting rifle, .44 pistols and such for responders.
---
It'd be a nice touch to the otherwise pretty generic scorched, and they can even be mixed since they are a hivemind.
---
After that tip you if still need back up let us know.
---
I see 1 in all stats, luck included
---
As long as I get to tie other players to chairs and see if their blood samples react to being burned, I'm down. 
---
Just don't turn doggos into horriffic pooch spider monsters and force me to kill them!
---
But geckos were in original Fallouts too.
---
The bodies of legendary ghouls at the golf course
---
Not anymore. They go around and climb it.

I get the same thing. When I check task manager it says program not responding. Be happy you don't have my issue where an major section of the map near Charleston must be avoided or the game crashes. Lucky that I got all my Riverside stuff done during BETA cause now it's impossible to go there. Been waiting on that fix since the first patch. So sick of it. 
---
i ve got this bug on my two shot pistol powder one times, bug dissapear short time after relog...
---
was funny
---
That's a beauty.
---
don't worry, a future patch has got you covered.
---
head southwest from solomons pond and bag yourself a Behemoth while it's bugged 
---
It's the same holotape where the two bodies are found, you just have to listen to the very end of the tape.
---
There is no unused point beneath luck. I‚Äôm sorry for the misunderstanding. I meant unused points. Luck has none while the others have 1 unused points. Why? Is this correct?
---
Idk I use a AAE 50 cal for queen fights and I love it.  Your choice may be build dependent/whatever you can find to buy or trade.
---
I'm up for grouping and exploring too, I have a new character at lvl 10 who is currently still at Flatwoods. My ign's ariyx. (warning: though it's my second character, but I'm still planning to listen/read all notes and holotapes, so hope you don't mind the waiting =p)
---
you sound like a fellow [filthy casual](https://reddit.com/r/fo76Filthycasuals)
---
Abbie because she was a girl and I will finally know how it feels to sleep in a girls bed &lt;3 
---
Also I will deeply smell all of her leftover clothes.
---
Wondering this as well. I've yet to find them. And no, they're not in Lights.
---
1: Log On
---
2: Get enough stuff to sell

3: Go sell the stuff

4: Do events that are worth it

5: Log off

Coming to hold your beer.
---
I will try, maybe I miss it
---
I too haven't fought the Scorchbeast Queen properly as I don't like power armour, which seems almost mandatory to fight her.  I tried twice and it ended poorly, and ended up running away after using a ton of resources.  If you just wear a hazmat suit you just get ripped apart.  You should be able to wear it as under armour.  This also applies to nuke zones too.
---
Crybaby attention wanter
---
I guess not many people know that it's primarily Bethesda's Austin Texas studio who's working on Fallout 76? Believe it or not they don't have a whole lot of experience with a project like this. Well... I guess it does show.
---
Bethesda's other more prominent studios are working on other titles.
---
So far I have used it to extremely great effect after logging into 3 score beasts attacking at once. Spam firing vats criticals with it let me take one out of the sky in like 8 seconds. Though it has the normal durability so it breaks fairly quickly when firing so fast. 
---
Did the event Census Violence tonight, and the mobs attacking the protectron were deathclaws. Made 15 deathclaw steaks when it was over. Man, that got a lot hairy with two of us. 
---
It kind of was meant as that. They gave Fallout 76 to primarily be worked on by an inexperienced studio of theirs, where as their more prominent studios have been working on bigger titles.
---
Yah we are. Or we have the roleplay "out" of playing the first generation children of the geniuses picked for the vault. It's on the Overseer's terminal about the first vault born baby.
---
What I want to know is.... if we play as the first gen vault children, where the hell are our parents (and possible siblings)? On the flip side, if we play the middle-aged genius, where the hell is our spouse and/or child(ren)?  If we're 50-60 then we shouldve had plenty of time to find someone we fancied and optionally had a kid or had a surrogate or adopted or even lab-grown a kid w/e.
---
Well, from what I've seen the actual barrel length literally remains the same anyway, so there is that before even questioning the rest. 
---
Makes a change from your mum, I guess.
---
i herd a rumor that when pach 5 lunched x01 plan for mod were aveleble st some vendor never got info wich one 
---
There use to be exploit where you could use party boy/girl to get alcohol doubled to help with temporary carry weight to get to the next vendor in that you drink unequip the card and still keep the stats now you can't do that and need the card equipped to keep the stats. I assume Bethesda when they get time big if they might do the same with this perk being required to keep the extra damage, fixing this sounds more work then party boy/girl though.
---
nice! would 59fps cap @60hz do the same thing?  
---
fyi recent patch made me have to use lighting on low - same with a streamer who uses a gtx 1080ti, he has to use low shadows and lighting as of most recent patch. thankfully this isnt much of a loss visually  
---
1. I got the BoS combat armor plans from treasure maps,
---
2. If you need the BoS on your combat armor, I'd be more than happy to do it for you. I think I also have a lining plan for the BoS underarmor learned as well
---
Off-topic question. You say you got Leather Armor. Any chancen you got the Legendary Leather Right Leg? May be willing to trade for ALL I OWN INCLUDING MY LIFE OMG
---
Phoenix in Watgoa sells them
---
That‚Äôs amazing thanks for the time you took to write it all, these are exactly the things I was thinking about fallout 76! All of them! Nothing to add from my side here, Bethesda should have people like you in their studio. 
---
Well it is Bethesda Austin, formerly Battlecry Studios, and not the main Bethesda guys on this game.
---
As to how many no idea.
---
Probably not. When something like that happened to me, the quest started working again and the item showed up the next day.
---
It's based off your level of luck, but it does take awhile. I got all the T51b piece plans from doing maps with my friend who has their luck maxed out, it definitely takes high luck and a lot of patience as the plans the maps drop you are randomized
---
That day will be a VERY long way off.
---
My problem is the lore of monsters changed overtime. Play fallout 1,2, and tactics....the monsters were intelligent and sometimes that made them more lethal. Weaponry was more diverse and there where vehicles. 
---
Cut to the modern fallout where every monster is full of bloodlust and can barely speak or think and vehicles just don‚Äôt exist anymore.
---
You can use the extended magazine for help with aiming with the sights. It lines up in the direction of the shots.
---
Crouching.
---
I didn't even know that. Huh. I mean I'd say "just let Oblivion take over" but that's just harsh. I mean Yeah, environmental story-telling is right up their alley (what if every place Was as deep and interesting as Vault 11?) but Bethesda is doing an okay job and there's no reason to lose hope, yet. At the same time, the only friend who was willing to buy the game with me quite after one week and said he'd check back in 6 months time. At this rate, in three months, he's just gonna quit again. I'm not supporting his decision, the game's fun. But, egh, I get why people quit and call it a day (or half a year). 
---
I don't believe so, I take it that's the quest that involves the Glassed Cavern? 
---
What I would love is the main camp with all your bells and whistles, and then a CAMP just a fire with a stockpot and a toolbox I can scrap at and repair stuff (armor and weapons) and a stash along with a tent or sleeping bag. Simple and portable. 
---
Chameleon on an armor piece of the stealth boy torso nod for power armor (depending on how he was clad) will make him invisible when crouched and not moving. Crouching makes him invisible on the map.
---
This game stopped giving me wood ages ago.
---
(Congratz, you found a meth gum)[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/After_Burner_gum]
---
Really? Majority of forums don't have downvote function.
---
On PS4 only 87% of people have left Vault 76.
---
You should still be able to assign a card there though
---
Boom Tish...
---
Would be willing to buy...
---
I mean, yeah, it's ridiculous but there's always a portion of people who simply just bought the game. But yeah, that's definitely not 13%. 
---
I saw it again yesterday at R&amp;G
---
I passed 1200 screws last night but I still can't stop looting desk fans.
---
The one closest to the train station?  I have the same problem.
---
This is flat-out not true.
---
Yes what I wrote was in sarcastic manner. However being sarcastic wasn't my point.
---
This is not getting anyway.
---
I completely agree. I'm a frequent nuker and im tired of nuking fissure prime and white spring. I want reward or excitement out of nuking any area on the map. A few bosses equivalent to scorchqueen would be great. PLEASE
---
You're a pedulant child. This is the big boy's table. Go play with your toys. 
---
You can buy them for 260 in harpers ferry vendor bot . They are not hard to come by in his inventory, just server hop a few times 
---
Good to know, thanks. Ill save up some more caps and then have somebody buy it for me for their profit I guess...
---
You first.
---
I think the bigger problem with having no human npcs and living ppl is that it was just done poorly. I love being an prewar archaeologist in Fallout games, greedily eating up the lore and piecing together the lives and politics and programs and corrupt corporations of the pre-war times. It makes for great environmental storytelling. Understanding the lives and histories of the past is how we can better prevent the same pitfalls and violence and mistakes of the present and helps to make a better informed future....  
---
What I don't like is being an archaeologist for things that happened 5-25 years ago and everyone is dead and everything you do has zero impact and you are just listening to all the epic power struggles, Christmas Flood, frantic scorched defense and training and recruiting new ppl to the communities, the nail biting work on the scourge virus to try curing it or making ppl immune from it, skirmishes with the raiders, on and on, all these things that happened.  Things we could have been a part of, affecting things and helping ppl, joining and building up our chosen faction.... It just makes things seem so hollow and like missed narrative opportunity of where the game could've set itself.  
---
offer ._.
---
Its like almost no difference FPS wise between low and ultra settings. The game just runs like that.
---
I certainty couldn't go without, although the ones I use mainly help me carry more shit, which isn't a core requirement of the game, but just kinda very handy to the way how I play it.
---
Sure a majority of one stars are barely above a non-legendary, and finding 3 stars is quite more difficult, worse yet, to find decent or good 3 stars. And the better gear you have, the more difficult it becomes, to find anything better.
---
I'm going to forget to reequip Starched-Genes sooner or later on account of Super Duper. Going to be a sad day when I chug that Radaway and lose the adrenal mutation.
---
Why though? You have massive resistance in power armour compared to regular armour, almost 5x as much in all 3 resistances.
---
I‚Äôll give you:
---
- 6 loose screws
---
- 1 raw cobalt flux
---
- 3 ionized meat 
---
- 13 caps
---
Bending me over a barrel but I aim to please 
---
I didn't get the Achievement for that on the Xbox One, because I created my character during the BETA.
---
Anything achievements/trophies your character would have unlocked during the BETA do not carry over to the full version of the game.
---
Dude gets farmed but other guy is loser? Lolololol idiot. walk.... Away. Easy fix. 
---
Because of Bugthesda
---
I've also got a GTX 970 and I don't have these issues could it be ram related?
---
They nerfed something that made the game more tolerable. It'd be laughable if it wasn't so obnoxious. 
---
That would take the perk giving bonus damage from glowing enemies from useful as hell to mandatory for all high levels.
---
I personally have noticed that vendors across stations rotate plans that they seem to share, so sometimes R&amp;G Station has the letters and numbers signs plan for 9k, other times that plan will be on a different vendor somewhere else.
---
But some plans if not most seem to be static for each vendor.
---
Is this your way of saying the game is fine? Lmao
---
Yeah my Xo-1 right arm goes into my inventory EVERY SINGLE TIME I enter the PA.  Then I have to go into my pip boy and attach the arm again while in the suit.  It is fully repaired with zero dmg on any piece.  
---
16 GB DDR3? I think.
---
You do know they can just attempt to capture the workshop and go to where you are on the map with friends help etc to pvp you.
---
Well Ima need you to hop off and write a ticket request for this one.. 
---
Thing is this is the next day.
---
That's can't be it then I only run 8 GB
---
I'm on PS4 but without a doubt in my mind the infinitely spawning bots that often leave several dozen corpses outside the entrance does not help in the slightest. 
---
Lucky girl, did she keep the DNA? Just imagine what you could do with an army of Todd clones. I‚Äôd have my hands wrapped around the throat of the world with everyone lusting for a copy of Skyrim 2.
---
Plus, what would that accomplish? "Yeh, we made a lackluster game and we don't know how to fix or support it. Sorry."  
---
\*crickets\*
---
Im not 100% sure but I think I found a paper saying there were some children too. If i remember correctly it was in the questline with the boy going missing in the park
---
Why? If only because it doesn't say 'no power armor' on the perk card. Fair enough? I'm melee, this shit counts. 
---
How do we know this, again? I'm not disputing you, I simply can't Google how we know and I see this in the sub over the last few days
---
Well that explains at least some of them I guess. It was a strange thing to notice when looking through the achievements.
---
If they‚Äôve really moved on, that‚Äôs just fair. I mean, that‚Äôs exactly what the customers are doing with Anthem and Division 2 just around the corner.
---
3 ionized meat, surely you jest? I could get this for 5.
---
Maybe I need to update my driver's again *shrug*. Though I could swear I did that shortly after release.
---
Workshops are for pvp. Turn pacifist off and stop crying
---
Grahm has park bench, stone benches, and metal picnic table. His inventory is not static either. I had a friend hold him while I logged in and out of the server multiple times ( I was looking for the Super Sledge plan). These plans showed up half the time. Unsure about the others.
---
That's how you force even more people in power armor
---
Grahm
---
I wish I could plant everything from soot flowers and bloodleafs to snaptail reeds and silt beans, and various 'resource' items to spawn docile animals or to produce animal meat at a super slow rate.  Let me plant pumpkins and cranberries dang it!
---
Again Gilligan......... Walk..... Away. You don't Wana die? DONT CAP WORKSHOPS!!!! you getting farmed is not an exploit. It's just you being dumb. Either turn off pacifier and fight or leave server. 
---
Your opinion is correct. Claiming a workshop in pacifist mode is ill advised.
---
You on xbox? Which treasure maps? Mire or cranberry bog?
---
It's a few interns locked in a room with Todd Howard yelling in their ears "IT JUST WORKS" "MAKE IT WORK".
---
I thought the same thing initially. I don't believe Hardened Mass drop without the radiation though? Could be that I'm just extremely unlucky!
---
What kinda weapons/armor were you wanting to trade for it?
---
Sure, you could get 5 in auction. But you‚Äôll need the right buyer and cover the fees involved. It‚Äôs the best I can do my man. 
---
Exactly this
---
tell me about your cpu :)
---
It still adds on top of that but if you're going melee it's better to use reactive plates.
---
Gunsmith keeps the guns from breaking, and if you aren't experiencing guns breaking, you are lucky that your viddya game broke bad in your favour
---
I also am inefficient in keeping one card of Lockpick on all the time, as the majority of locks can be opened with it, so easy. I remove it if I need that slot for something but always quickly equip again, the QoL of keeping a rank there is too high! :)
---
But Gunsmith is our good friend and wants a word with you
---
1. Yeah I'm on Xbox,
---
2. Majority of the pieces were found at Savage Divide #1 &amp; #8, and others at Cranberry Bog #1
---
lol same, that Lone Wanderer perk SHOULD be slotted but hey I'm not Einstein!
---
You‚Äôre a lonely loser who won‚Äôt ever get a real word in edgewise 
---
Yea, replaying fallout 2 right now. I've always liked the geckos there :)
---
Because of the dev's hubris to think that the game will be around for 7600 hours given the state that their launched the game in.
---
I'd like to see the game just make it past 76 weeks.
---
Let me tell you all about the secret lives of teddy bears...
---
Game developers should jot down these quotes from the shills defending this game, so next time they fucked up they can just re-use these quotes as scripts and give them to their staff 
---
What CPU are you running?
---
I'd rather a Sea of Thieves style "hybrid" chat option.  You always talk with your teammates regardless of their distance away and to the randoms in the area immediately around you.
---
Oh don't get me wrong, guns do break on me sometimes. I have 2 rifles, so if my main breaks, I'll switch to the second, finish what I'm doing, and then go repair the first one (to 200% with Weapon Artisan).
---
I personally don't find it a hassle, but please understand that I'm not saying Gunsmith is useless by any means. I just don't find that I need it.
---
*plans, not pieces. You can get the plans from other spots as well, but those were the spots that we had the most luck at, plans wise
---
Throw in a 1909 us penny and I'll give it to you.
---
Thanks for clearing it up. Dont the plates only reflect melee damage? I was thinking killing stuff faster by getting my damage up would be the way to go
---
Crafting is a great source of XP. It is also a cheaper way to get the lion's share of mods.
---
Bloodied explosive shotguns, 3* unyielding armor. But I just want caps so I can buy those as I go.
---
Maybe if we could place sleeping bags down as a respawn point or something, give some extra use to all those fancy skins they get.
---
Loot from sbq is the same as any 3 star legendary (plus ultracite explosive vents)
---
I thought all rise was a quest exclusive 
---
I'm wearing L25 set someone gifted me because I haven't done the quest yet, but mine certainly deteriorates. It started at about 133%, and both of my legs are down to 90%. The rest is still close to full though, oddly enough. I've worn it 5 levels, mostly in Whitesprings.
---
There are a few slitpeas around that give cobalt. Few by entrance facing the station and along that road. Mainly near intersections. Once u see one you will know what to look for. . The jump out at ya after finding one lol
---
I'm convinced he was inside a wall the other day. The Watoga bots had surrounded a particular stretch of wall and there were no hostiles on the opposite side that were accessible. 
---
I'm forced to relog to try find him. Can't find any evidence of him the next time. Religious and... Immediately reconnect to the same server. 
---
I concur. They should just change his faction to Watoga bots and we can pretend he's still BoS.
---
I'm on a 15 int/15 luck run with an 'alt' primarily advancing solely as a crafter. No way do I want to waste screws and springs on repairs when I don't have to. You say 'they break sometimes' but for most of us, they break a few times a day, and Gunsmith 5 always equipped with Luck of the Draw one star = never repairing, ever.
---
Repairing most melee is so cheap I decided not to keep Weaponsmith constantly slotted, but Gunsmith I consider the best default 5-int slotting possible for all character types :)
---
You will notice that when you open a container it has a weight limit also. Usually this limit is 10 or 20 pounds. But some have a 0 weight limit. These are the ones people use to fill with items, either for transfer or for donation. I've found and left plenty of loaded suitcases at train stations fill with ammo and junk scrap. 
---
The one workshop that provides people with a worthwhile rewards (fusion cores) looks like it could use a good nerf. Oops, too much. That's okay, we'll fix it in a month or so.
---
Invisible one ? 
---
But was it, legendary! Lolz
---
Well, you know, since you know me so well and for so long, I will certainly hold your opinions in high esteem..
---
They don't bother me, what does bother me is the monkey toys with glowing red eyes, those bastards all have to be shot.
---
Not a bad thought really. Patches were more consistent early on. Then they release a bug riddled patch and didn‚Äôt have the decency to hotfix it by the end of the week. Heck, even the end of the next week. For the first time last weekend, I found myself in a totally empty server. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I then experienced the server not responding message cooking my normal carrot soup. I just logged and did something else. That was very depressing for me.
---
Yeah i did SBQ once just to have legendary wood pieces and plans i already own.  I didn't bother to do it again. It is not worth it.
---
I hope the next patch will make it interesting again 
---
I just wrote out a comment that i copy/pasted into word. Its 3 pages long so Im not gonna post it here. Its about how 76 has saved my life. Its kinda long and personal, but the gist is I've been off work since August with an arm injury and since 76 came out its all I have found enjoyment in.
---
Ive played Fallout 76 for 820+ hours and am level 443. I really truly don't enjoy anything in life anymore except for my dog. So for 76 to hold my attention as it has, I can't thank it more. After WoW's BFA failed hard at giving meaningful character progression I love 76. That said, it kinda sucks and I want more. 
---
Lolz, no bulking items groups them together, reduce your stash size.
---
Try it and see
---
Seems like other 3 star do at least drop a 1* wood armor lmao
---
Again, not disagreeing with you at all :)
---
I like to play with Batteries Included in power armor, simply because cores are ridiculously heavy. Using Gunsmith would be possible with some tweaks but I'd need a minimum of 8 Int and would lose the Scrapper and Hacker perks.
---
I compensate for this by obsessively picking up clipboards, typewriters, globes, desk fans etc as I adventure, and I haven't run out (yet lol).
---
Having said that, I may just try Gunsmith out for a while, because what you say makes a lot of sense too :)
---
Oh gawd another post about breaking up with Bethesda. I have new for you...Bethesda is not a girl and does not require a break up announcement.
---
I don‚Äôt know what game you are playing. I have played FO76 for a couple of months and I have had maybe four disconnects. I have okayed for several 6 hour+ sessions without a single issue.
---
Maybe Bethesda the ‚Äúgirl‚Äù doesn‚Äôt like you...
---
I've been saying since the first patch that this game is being maintained by a skeleton crew, probably just one engineer, one or two designer/scripter types, and maybe an artist who's working on stuff part-time while otherwise working on Starfield.
---
This opinion comes from two decades shipping commercial video games as a senior/lead engineer myself. I know what a typical team can do in N weeks. This team moves about as quickly as a small handful of modders working in their spare time, and I want to be clear that that is a deliberate, earnest comparison, and _not_ a sarcastic joke.
---
I use PA mostly when I'm lazy. My 3* ones are categorically stronger. 
---
The 33% is this the thin white line above the bigger yellow health bar of an armor piece? I forgot about those, some of them are away, but the yellow bar is still full on every piece.
---
this! they may be bastards but they ain't stupid. I wonder, in one year or so, when we look back if anything severe has been done. I doubt, it will change for the better. people will move on, money saved, hopes slowly dissolved. what a clusterfuck of a project, amazing.
---
Lol well i guess u were slightly more "lucky" to get at least one legendary piece haha
---
Does this mean i will be able to assign any number of points to a max of 15 S.P.E.C.I.A.L. to cater to any build i‚Äôd like? Yes i‚Äôm wble to assign a card there. But on lvl 3 luck i assign 2 lvl 1 cards but it fully fills up 3 luck. Why?
---
With assaultrons use a grenade then quickly press VATS and shoot the grenade before the AI has a chance to run.
---
Pulse grenades are devastating to them (and all robots) but plasma grenades do great damage too.
---
The SBQ should drop items you can't find anywhere else.  And also she should be without bugs
---
This explains an awful lot, good to know!
---
I honestly don't believe the dev team could create something like that, maybe if they had designed it that way from the start. But trying to add it now would take them years going by their simple patch times.
---
Wait for a couple of minutes for the game to load your pipboy in, this has happened to me, I relogged 3 times in a row before finding out its just the game standing you still for a menu that hasn't loaded yet upon spawning in.
---
Best bet is to hold off on opening the pipboy when you load in for a few minutes.  It's frustrating, I know.
---
Same
---
&gt;There are so many trolls and griefers online lately that it's not worth the small benefit they provide against mobs. 
---
Does this happen often? If they do automatically damage anyone nearby I don't ever recall other players having them, then.
---
&gt;This can happen even if you have Pacifist mode turned on. 
---
That's clearly a bug. I don't see my poison aura thing damaging other players.
---
Sometimes they drop nothing as well
---
Maybe EA paid Amazon to sabotage the servers. Ooooh corporate espionage and sabotage and intrigue.
---
Hey look it's the obsessive stalker weirdo who thinks Bethesda likes him because she looked at him.
---
I'm sure the entire team in Austin is still working on it, I mean the only reason they were purchased by Bethesda all those years ago was to make fo76, well after they scrapped the fo4 co op 
---
That's the area, not the gum.
---
Au contraire, my friend. What they should do is change it so you don't get wanted when in pacifist mode. Griefers commiting accidental suicide is a fun mechanic, please don't nerf that!
---
I7 4770k? It's been a couple years since I assembled it but that sounds right
---
I understand that it should state it but melee builds do so much better damage wise, out of the power armour but have the lack of resistances so serendipity helps that. 
---
You cant sponge damage and dodge. 
---
A scorchbeast can crawl out of a fissure and murder me before I've even loaded into the world. Pretty cheap... 
---
Met a scorchbeast that believed in nonstop blasting its attacks.
---
That bothered me.
---
An i7 4770k IIRC. One of those numbers may be different 
---
Not for everyone o:
---
Me ? naw. 
---
I learned awhile back bringing work home cost me everything.
---
We‚Äôre just like everyone else here. trying to keep a roof over our heads, food on the table. 
---
But now, Work stays at work. And, nothing is so important that it makes you table your  wife, and family over a job, a game a hobby.
---
Power armor is insanely durable, especially compared to normal armor. I haven't even had to repair all of my pieces after 60ish levels.
---
&gt;I think no one knows what those ‚Äúclusters‚Äù are. It seems like metal and dirt was attracted to a point in space, maybe sucked in. In two of them we also see bodies of animals and human skeletons, which I suspect is an indication of ritual sacrifices.
---
Uh, what? Those places are clearly SB nests.
---
&gt;Inspecting the ‚Äúclusters‚Äù, I discovered a weird common point. First, I noticed the same vines that hide the entrance to the Interloper cave in Lucky Hole Mine. Then I wondered if there was anything behind the vines in the clusters. And there is. Sort of. All four clusters have a small hidden ‚Äúalcove‚Äù.
---
Which means nothing more than they used the same cluster instead of making individual sets of different rocks.
---
I don't think there's any elaborate backstory to those faces. There would be more hints if there were anything. They are just world decorations. Fitting enough, although a bit too similiar to Dwemer.
---
Well those plants aren't really so useful.
---
I get exactly the same on PS4.  Especially at whitesprings. Frame rate drops ridiculously low
---
It's not going to stay clean if you use it.
---
I think they talk about it in the Fallout 76 NoClip documentary on YouTube. Might‚Äôve also been touched on in interviews post-E3 but I don‚Äôt have any links to that. Pretty sure Bethesda Maryland built the game and Bethesda Austin are maintaining it while Maryland focus on Starfield. 
---
Yeah I'm still playing a lot. Still enjoying it.
---
Interesting theory.  But I don‚Äôt think it is the root cause.  Just look at BOS vendor Phoenix.  He carries a lot more plans than Watoga Station with all the PA Mods.
---
If it is weird to be interested in a video game subreddit, sort by new, and either post contributing positive content or call out others for their negative band wagon bullshit.....then I am weird.
---
I think weird is not enjoying something like a video game and then hanging around that community to continually troll and try to negatively influence other players overall gaming experience.
---
If you like the game play it. If you don‚Äôt like the game then go find a game that you do like.
---
Seems like a simple enough concept
---
Occasionally!!! I got 119 game crash from the targeting HUD(PS4 pro).
---
Oh gawd, another reply complaining about someone complaining about the state of the game. I have news for you, you sound like a little sissy girl. You must lika...do da cha cha... like a sissy girl. Maybe take your tiny little nipples to France. 
---
Bethesda does like fanbois like you to keep its  game alive. 
---
And if you want to share a negative opinion beware because weirdo stalker will jump on your post and pretend like he's Bethsdas real BF.
---
Bump.
---
I‚Äôve seen them all over, like remnants of people in their former lives.
---
There‚Äôs a little open setting , north v76 where there‚Äôs a room all laid out with furniture, and mannequins 
---
Like you‚Äôre waiting for them to move and go about their lives.
---
Given the subject of the SBQ, less explosive vent that I thought it would be.
---
Woosh
---
What does reactive plates do?
---
Are you really going to the level? Is that the best that you can do? Calling someone a sissy girl over the innernets? 
---
Logging in at my camp often triggers two groups of super mutants to go berserk, so my first five minutes is often spent painting the landscape with gore. 
---
A third of the enemies at the Top of the World are dead by this point so I do a lap and loot all the goodies: plans, chems, alcohol, frag grenades and Nuka-Cola are plentiful. 
---
Back to camp to craft a few thousand more 5.56mm and Nuka/Quantum grenades. Mix up some more Pyschobuff and Bufftats.
---
Then onto the daily challenges to earn more Atoms that I'll probably never spend at this rate...
---
It probably doesn't happen at all. That's a stupid effort to go through while hoping the player stands still for them to do it. People massively overpay griefers / trolls in this game. Also a lot of people don't seem to know what griefer means and post here saying "Somebody killed a legendary before I could shoot it" or "they shot me a few times from a room trying to initiate PVP". They aren't griefers.
---
They need to play GTAO in a public lobby for a few days to understand what a griefer is.
---
Are you really going to the level? Is that the best that you can do? Getting upset over someone calling you a sissy girl because you complained about someone complaining over the innernets?
---
I got in such a habit grabbing desktop fans in fo4 that it continued into fo76. 
---
Yeah that is bs. The problem is if they base it on who did most damage then people with all damage perk cards, aid items, in a group, etc would get all the good stuff. Did you get a drill or some unique weapon that isn't legendary, because it replaces the legendary loot drop.
---
in defense of the "Feed the People" event, it used to feed everyone on the server when it was completed but that was taken away from us 
---
I thought they were purchased to make mobile games?
---
Apparently this can also happen with the Electrically Charged mutation.
---
The last time i've checked i where human...not a iguana.
---
Sir, if you wish to pray to your god, you may find the Pantheon of Tamriel prayer room more to your comfort. It's down the hall on your right.
---
Just trade it in at gamestop and you'll get $0.75 for it.
---
wow, that's so incredibly dumb. So we spend time getting all this dried food and putting it into a processor, and then we can't even use it? That sounds incredibly stupid. this is exactly why people don't play this game. Just silly design changes that are designed to drive people away
---
They dedicated pretty much an entire studio to it. Unless most of them have been fired I‚Äôm going to guess they‚Äôre still working on it. As far as we know there isn‚Äôt even a ‚Äúnext project‚Äù for Austin to work on, and it‚Äôd be hard for me to believe that Bethesda would just give them a next big project to do when their last project was struggling so much. I think this post is speculation at most.
---
He is Bethesda's real BF. Can't you tell by how they did not nerf his White Knight perk card? 
---
Perfectly stated. For the first time last weekend, I loaded into a map with no players. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I was so depressed. Even more so when I got the server not responding message while making my carrot soup. I think it‚Äôs time for me to go back to Dead by Daylight for a bit.
---
Actually, in terminals in vault you can find records about first baby born on the vault. So, I guess, some of os is younger then 25 years.
---
 People are all ages in the vault. Some went in as adults with their children. Some were born in there.
---
How would they repopulate if they were all 60??
---
I think it is a unique and interesting spin. The stories are engaging and even have easter eggs that you can discover. 
---
It does not make sense from a story perspective to ‚Äúreclaim‚Äù something that has already been claimed. NPCs would mean communities and communities would mean that similar groups are already reclaiming. Instead you as a player are launched into a lonely world that has been ravaged by an overwhelming antagonist. An antagonist that was so successful it eliminated almost everything else. You get to reexperiemce the trials and tribulations of the last few survivors as they are wiped out. Hear about their battles, their hopes, and their dreams.  
---
Those that exited the vault with you are either going to help you along your way or become your enemy. Meanwhile you have to deal with this threat before the reclamation can begin.
---
I was skeptical at first but it is A+ story telling
---
Spoiler. There was a nuclear war.
---
There were birds in NV I don‚Äôt think they were institute.
---
Unassigned means you have a card that can go into that slot, but you are not using it.  So if you have 2 1-point cards and 3 Luck "Unassigned" won't show until you have a 3rd 1-point card that can go in the slot.
---
You have to announce your break ups..?
---
Oh, they'll do that too, but if they forced people to start new characters it could be pure for at least a day. The point is whether they can dupe or not in the new servers, they've already been duping for months in the old servers, and allowing people to keep their characters is the heights of idiocy. Even if there was no duping it's dumb to let people carry over progress from an easier mode to a harder mode.
---
Yeah, my lvl 7 melee guy I rolled last night ended up with the marsupial mutation. I kept it as long as I could before using radaway. I hated to get rid of it, I was having fun jumping on buildings and such. I was going to avoid starched genes and using mutation serums, but not anymore. That was too fun. 
---
I would like to see more boss enemies in future updates, like fighting a deathclaw mother or an alpha deathclaw or even fighting a variation of a super mutant boss( like a spuer mutant that would take the whole server to eliminate, having the size of a small building for example). We overall need more boss enemies other than the SBQ to have a small bit of diversity IMO.
---
I hate PA so much. I hate the interface, I hate the aesthetic.
---
I stopped playing since the white knight nerf. Haven‚Äôt felt tempted to go back.
---
If you want to get the point across and create drama then I guess 
---
It's what I said to my friend earlier. That it feels like the devs are working on ES6 or Starfield and just have a director pulling straws like "Jimmy and Duke are the lucky ones to work on fallout 76 this week". Other games like Black Desert have been expanded to almost double size and that's because of a whole studio working on the game, I doubt Bethesda has a studio dedicated to F76 right now, unless they assign a passionate studio to work on F76 the game will never get a world update, like adding new areas. I mean, the game is supposed to be an exploring experience, if you are done with things to explore, it's gonna get boring no matter how many events they are coding in.
---
This. Sorry if I was unclear. I didn't mean there were unlimited items in the containers for me to pick up, but rather they have unlimited capacity for me to put items in.
---
Agreed!
---
Any idea why they are floating? I do have one.
---
I am not upset. I found it funny. I haven‚Äôt been called a sissy girl in decades. Kind of nostalgic for the playground experience.
---
I have a hangover btw
---
Yeah, like these "I'm out" posts after every patch are such crap. Like they want us to turn the music off so they can announce they are leaving the party.
---
Don't like the game any more? Fair enough. Just go ffs. I didn't enjoy Borderlands and gave it up after a few hours. I didn't post to their sub like I was am important loss to their gamer pool that demands acknowledgment.
---
Thank you for the update. I scrapped about 200 combat armor pieces the last days and despite the upgrade for the helmet, haven't learned anything bos related. So I think it's safe to say that you have to find the plans. 
---
Lolz then go back to the vault?
---
Awww poor baby. üò´üò´üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
What's special in that mod? Only red aura?. Why is  better than recon scope mod?
---
Soo, did u eat it?
---
And if you have the repair perk maxed, it‚Äôll stay at full strength forever - my level 45 has  some pieces that are getting closer to the 100% mark but they‚Äôre all fully charged still - can‚Äôt even remember when I repaired them last.
---
I don't wanna be the one to tell you... but look up the lore about what they are.
---
I have a 2* bloodied explosive shotgun for trade but unfortunately can‚Äôt give up my unyielding sentinels. 
---
You think handmade isn't as rare as assault rifle, srs., Have you actually played the game 
---
I would like to know where most of this was promised. Give me links!
---
Where do u farm your ballistic?
---
Oh gawd another fanboi response who takes any level of tongue in cheek criticism towards the sacred Todd way to fucking serious and decides to defend the honor of his m'lady on his white steed. 
---
Its a bit mind blowing, that, however the fuck many patches have been dropped, the player base has absolutely no way of even selecting a prefered region for whatever server selection pool the backend shits you into.  Pretty sure ultima online had that at launch. Its almost like a well worn pathway exists and all bethesda had to do was pay attention, see what hard won lessons were out there, and have a plan. Fuck that though, duct tape and staples is what shipped. It's like they went out of their way to ignore all the reams and reams and reams of data on how to handle the "multiplayer" part of a multiplayer game. 
---
I would absolutely fucking love to try and troubleshoot. if only the barest minimum of effort was placed into one of the most critical systems of any multiplayer game maybe I could. You'd think a 2.5¬†billion privately held company with a stable of multiplayer games that work just fine could scrape together something workable and stable for one of their most valuable IP's especially given the profile of the project and new the direction for said IP.
---
But whatever. Giddy up.
---
ill give you my liver for a pump shotgun plan.
---
dont ask, its personal
---
That is one of my favorite things to do.....Have to protect against Zombies
---
Exactly. No one cares if they do not enjoy the game..except maybe Bethesda. But this is a player driven forum and not Bethesda‚Äôs marketing forum. If you want to tell Bethesda that their game sucks then send them an email. 
---
Most of the ex-players that post here are trying to influence others. They want to punish Bethesda. It is a video game. If you don‚Äôt like it then vote with your dollars and your feet. Go find a game that you do like. 
---
I don't have this issue but I use the jet pack to slowly fall when I jump off high things. Maybe that.
---
I'm glad you found it funny. I also found it funny when I watched Bruce Almighty. I agree, the playground is such a wonderful place. 
---
Farming for caps is a thing though.  It requires more than 1 person to be efficient.  You look for claimed workshops on the map.  Find the person that owns them.  Have one member tp to the player.  Other member claims the workshop then cancels it.
---
The poor sap who owns the workshop will be flagged as PvP to the guy near him.  They get killed and lose caps.  Rinse and repeat on other servers.
---
500 damage?
---
Something wrong with your system, not the game, if you‚Äôre getting a disconnect - if on console (forget which one), someone has suggested checking your NAT (?) settings. Have a search, this has been mentioned before.
---
Where'd you get it? Would legitimately offer 500 caps (all I can afford to offer), but I'm on ps4.
---
Always take candy from strangers? Lolz
---
fair enough, highest bid is 18k atm, could I maybe buy that shotgun off you for caps?
---
They are in my experience quite well balanced. You can exceed the 'on paper' DPS of a two-shot explosive handmade.
---
The issue is triggering and maintaining addictions. It's not easy. I've had addictions overwrite one another and Sometimes addictions do not appear in the status screen. What we need is a perk card like Starched-Genes that makes addictions permanent. There is a perk to prevent addictions, but Starched-Genes both maintains mutations and prevents new ones. Give us that and Junkies will be very much viable. 
---
I just love when I see people like "I refunded" or "I uninstalled" like congrats you big intelligent mind, we had the chance to refund but we decided to give the game a chance instead of playing it for a week and go around telling people that the game is trash. I still hear people complaining about bugs that are not currently in game. And all that comes from people who stopped playing since month 1 and still to this day say shit like "ur camp will dissapear after you log out".
---
I'm not supporting that kind of fuckery we all went through with this game, but it annoys me when people are all like "I uninstalled" like ok congrats, is that what you wanna hear? Like the world cares that you uninstalled.
---
Instead of bitching and boasting about how you "uninstalled and refuned" what are you in here for? How about you let the game live or die without bitching about it and stop talking about it and lurking around the FO76 sub just so you can boast about how you uninstalled and refunded. No one cares.
---
Hahahahahahaha!
---
You just ruined this guys innocent apocalypse
---
Sad thing is the holotapes voice acting makes it feel like they are alive, but it all feels pointless. The enclave storyline is the only one feeling like you got something out of it.
---
Don't forget you can lose armor and weapons fast dumping into that processor, hasn't been fixed since beta smh.
---
im a 10000 year old dragon 
---
Praise the sun!
---
Or, you know, your legs are getting hit more than everything else?
---
Everyone that completes the event does get stew that gives +5% experience gain if you didn‚Äôt know, you get 5 of them but they expire pretty fast
---
If you don‚Äôt like it then go play something else. If you want Bethesda to have a record of your feedback then send them an email. 
---
This is a player driven forum. Typically ‚Äúplayers‚Äù are those people that are currently enjoying the game and actively contributing to it. Those people which include me don‚Äôt want to listen to repetitious bandwagoning bullshit. 
---
Consider your audience. We are not Bethesda, we do not care. I personally tale issue with people like you trying to overtly influence other potential player‚Äôs opinions with dramatic, anecdotal, and often false accusations. 
---
We enjoy the game and we would like other players that want to play to have the opportunity to decide fir themselves if the game has value or not. When you make a comment that you are disconnected every ten minutes I feel compelled to call bullshit. 
---
Don‚Äôt leave angry, just leave
---
ah yes, ive made the world a better place... for that guy who has 400 TSE miniguns and keeps making the universe implode somehow
---
There's talk of "unfixing" it, but yeah.
---
Welcome to F76, where broken things MIGHT get fixed, only to get re-broken, and awesome things get broken because they're too awesome.
---
Its seriously like someone high up at BGS is purposely tanking this game. The decision-making process is almost on the level of Hitler invading Russia. Visionary stupidity.
---
Yeah
---
It‚Äôs all over raider base..
---
1. Vendor run.
---
2. Check challenges (only started doing them very recently).
---
3. Take a couple of workshops and build them up for someone else.
---
4. Take tech data to BoS.
---
5. Craft ammo / craft guns and armour to scrap for mods.
---
5. Go start some shit with a scorched beast or something.
---
I concur, the Alien Blaster also really needs some love, lorewise it's supposed to be on par if not better than a plasma pistol. Even when using fusion mag.
---
I can get over 100 dmg from it in Fallout 4, but here I can't even get over 20 dmg.
---
I could see them saying - Hi we reduced the effectiveness of white knight but added the ability to get screws and ballistic cloth by scrapping items with bonuses to high int and scrapper perk.
---
See that is balancing.
---
Yes.  You don't have to have finished the quest to find what I wanted to mention, but its in the cave.  
---
Probably because of all the screws we're driving into said leather. For some reason beyond me.
---
I hope ur ing name is : 
---
# Bob Frazier
---
Quoting User ThePrawn: 
---
So Bethesda is STILL doing everything they can to get us to stop playing? 
---
lol
---
I have no friends :3
---
Leaving quietly won‚Äôt change shit. What do you think the point of social media is, anyway?
---
Go back to where the bodies exactly are?
---
Won‚Äôt that be a PITA no quest markers to tell you.
---
Had the game a couple weeks. Level 24. Barely log in anymore because the first 20 minutes of gameplay is fighting my inventory and weight.
---
Was hoping for a looter shooter. Got inventory management simulator v3.2.
---
You don't make sense. Me refunding wasn't even going to be part of the conversation that you randomly jumped in the middle of. Then you told me to stop bitching when I was telling someone else to stop bitching. Also, I lurk the sub so hopefully when/if they make some nice QoL changes I will come back. Nice to stay in the loop.
---

There is no way I will ever pre-order a Bethesda game again unless they acknowledge their mistakes. Normally an apology would be PR suicide, but I think in this case the reverse would be the case. Companies are made of people, and people make mistakes. Be honest, open and commit to making sure they never release a cash-grab again and a large part of the consumer base will be more forgiving and more open to buying future Bethesda games\*.
---
\*Assuming they don't do it again, because nobody is going to get burned a third time.
---
[Ps4 Slim] &lt;Bug&gt; Mt character got stuck while shooting a Gatling gun in silo Alpha (while fixing the reactor) he just stood there and emptied a clip into the wall 500 rounds I  could do nothing. After the gun was empty the game slowly started to give me control again. Then it was fine but for like 2 minutes I was frozen shooting a gun. 
---
I totaly spaced and didn't record it I was so confused by what was going on I didn't even think of it. I thought it was my controller. 
---
It SHOULD have been a Fallout 4 expansion, proper. New land mass, new weapons, new creatures, and co-op. They'd have made tons of money without all of the blowback. 
---
They have read it but it takes ages to get changes in for some reason. Either dev or testing phases maybe.
---
Biggest feedback on launch was people posting here about how the pacifist mode "made it impossible to be a raider" or stopped them role playing. Loads just said it was "BS" they couldn't outright kill other players.
---
So they are adding a mode to do just that.
---
I will never touch that mode myself as I have no interest in PVP in the slightest but it's not true to say people didn't ask for it (which I see a lot).
---
I've been down that rabbit hole so many times. New system. Ethernet directly to my muni gigabit. Fresh os install. updated drivers. no background anything happening which could only cause issues for a single application. Called my muni Provider and initiated support tickets out the ass until I got an answer on how my connection was being internally handled. According to them, latency FROM whatever I am connecting to when playing slowly increases until its high enough that on my end - i am assuming - the client decides something is wrong and says I have disconnected. The problem is in the client or in the back end. The latency creep screams bug and the client just responds like it should.  My brother has it on xbox and gf has it on PS4 - they have no issues. My house or theirs. I have dragged my computer over there and tried. Still have the issue. I am starting to wonder if my account name is somehow bugging part of the backend causing that latency creep. I'll wait for the next sale and find out. I just want to play. It pains me knowing there is a whole ocean of petty fucking complaints I could be shitposting about if only the boat I bought would randomly sink.
---
Happened to me today for the first time, didn't play any holotapes at the time
---
I imagined it as: I was 12 when both of my parent's were selected to enter vault 76.  As a result, I got a free pass and got to go as well.
---
Server hop if you want the workshop but not pvp!
---
Yeah, same 1 star, railroad station fodder.
---
That‚Äôs a lvl58 legendary. Can‚Äôt remember the stars count. Mean AF. 
---
I may go back and kill it when I‚Äôm atleast 80 or 100.
---
I found it the the holotape wasn't finished, maybe it stopped the first time. Now it listen it all
---
&gt; I didn't have an answer.
---
Why people stay in relationships they don't enjoy. Why people harm themselves in very direct means. Gamble fucktons of money away, taking deep debts they can't ever possibly pay.
---
Strange things people do. Luckily it mostly doesn't influence me.
---
Still? 
---
damn son. your tongue is so far up their ass you can taste what they are gonna eat for lunch before they finished breakfast.
---
yeah also fix the bug that increases ROF of gatling when you equip martial artist when we are at it.
---
It needs to be nuked.. if no ones nuking, no legendary.
---
The Vault closed after opening to prevent its population from remaining dependent on it.
---
What is it? Haha
---
I think they should have a system. I think if it was more of a widespread issue they would come up with a solution. I just feel with an online game they should have some sort of fix. 
---
I'm convinced that they're deliberately trying to kill off the game at this point, so they can write it off as a loss and move on to something else. That, or they desperately need to start firing some of the management.
---
I love the PA but I don't like playing with it. I like my games as hard as possible and somehow PA always felt a bit lit taking the easy way out haha.
---
Same. 
---
I got silenced handmade from a drop. Love it so much spent the $1500 caps to buy the plans.
---
Gonna level that and the hunting rifle.
---
I'm pretty sure I bought one from either one of the Watoga vendors or Harper's ferry vendor. 
---
They are already reduced. Have you not seen all the people posting to say Bethesda 'nerfed' power armour? They've been complaining about it since it was done.
---
I only use power armour for nukes and carry weight. When I get over 5 cores I just use use it generally to use them up though.
---
I have the torso, not sure where I got it tho. Sorry.
---
It started raining ingame for me yesterday and the rain broke, was motionless in the air. Had to do a full restart to fix that...
---
You keep what you kill. 
---
Not accurate enough XP
---
Since patch? O-o.
---
Never see them there
---
ah that one brotherhood one that ive never even gotten to the second step
---
Spoiler spoiler, all the fresh(er) corpses you find actually survived that nuclear war. They just then died to the scorched because Bethesda wanted all humans to be players (i.e. they were too lazy to make non-robotic NPCs work in a multiplayer game)
---
I'd probably rather shotguns went to Endurance then if you were going to split it up. 
---
They they need to dissolve Betheda Austin(battle cry).
---
They are not competent
---
yeah it happens sometimes, like some object a few miles off in the distance that you can always see, like through walls and stuff
---
weird
---
ahh i guess that makes sense. i view the comment as not specific to OP but to whomever it may concern.
---
I bought two premium editions. One PS4 one Xbox....... big mistake!!!
---
I think that mushroom batch came out good lol
---
They don't break every 20 seconds when fighting scorched? 
---
Not having this puts people off crafting high level foods.
---
I crafted a few, the one with blight and sugar bombs, the mixed meat stew is especially difficult to craft and even with good with salt they spoil far to quickly.
---
Just give us a fridge with say carry 20 weight.
---
They're in fo4 it wouldn't be hard to implement.
---
And while I'm here nuka cola recipies with craft able mixing machine.
---
One thing I noticed this morning, could be just coincidence, there was a wanted player in the map. I have been having this same issue with my detection meter and thought it was resolved. This morning the problem reoccurred. I poked around my area and shot off a few times to attract attention and no one came. I did notice that there was a wanted player on the map.
---
Note: I'm not trying to say that this is normal or that it had always been this way with wanted players.
---
I think it‚Äôs shorter then that.. but at times it feels longer lolz
---
Yep I actually bought the mod a few hours ago. Pretty cheap too, like sub 100 caps I think.
---
In the beginning, yeah. Because from your character's perspective it doesn't make sense that everyone is dead.  So they are holding hope that someone, somewhere must be alive. At the point they finish Rose's quests though, they are well aware of what's happened. The story shifts to preparing to defend themselves from a potentially world ending plague, and then eventually to finding and executing ways to end the plague.
---
 Because even though they never see a living soul, they are still maintaing hope that this situation is contained to the local region, and that somewhere out there, people have survived.  
---
The game's story is not about finding and protecting the people living in Appalachia. It's about saving the world, so that the survivors elsewhere can rebuild.  
---
I don't think you understand how pvp works. I don't really either, it's a botched system.
---
fuckyou
---
And a METAL floor!
---
Why is there only a transparent grate floor and a wood floor?
---
I see it as Bethesda having some problems. But they're good people, I'd hate to kick them while they're down. They can win some and they can mess up, but I'm still grateful they're here. (I rather enjoy 76 as it is though.)
---
Mod or plan? 
---
Sure, why not. I have played every Fallout game. I enjoy this Fallout game. I am a fan and I don‚Äôt care who is offended by that. 
---
So now you know why I am here. Why are you still here?
---
The mod itself, not the plan.
---
I get so frustrated with the scorched adds in the SBQ fight that it's usually just a matter of time before I can't take it anymore and relentlessly shoot the space invading bastards in the face. Even with the TSE nerf though the combination of Radicool and the Adrenal mutation means I die. Worth it. 
---
then you're a masochist. no sane person wouldn't be pissed after having their prized legendary that they farmed weeks for deleted for no reason at all.
---
OK good to know thx I will see thanks
---
Yeah, I didn't mean that they should abandon the game while releasing the CK and the option for privat servers.
---
There will be leaderboards on survival servers. Given some japanese will find a way to absurdly boost the numbers.Like killing a friend for a week to be unreachable.
---
I hate the sound. *clink clunk clink clunk rattle rattle*
---
That alone is enough to not use PA yet as a level 30 casual player I pretty much have to in order to compete with the high level enemies that always seem to spawn anywhere worth going. 
---
:D ok, are you female atleast?
---
Right, the extra is from a perk that allows one to repair up to 200%
---
Smaller side project? Bullshit. The way they hyped it up at E3 and released the thing for $60 initially with the choice of higher tiers costing even more does not say "smaller side project." 
---
I‚Äôve had scorched spawn dead. Thought it was cologne. Lolz
---
One of the dumber things is that you're doing all the Responder quests to get access to their data and you're able to do so because their automation is so self-sufficient any damn wanderer can just walk up and join them and rise through the ranks. Yeah, raiders totally couldn't take advantage of that system to kill everyone and get access to the Responder resources, no contingency plans necessary! Why would you want verification from a ranked registered Responder to let people join the Responders? That's just silly. Same goes for the BoS. What should be proud moments of ranking up are just weak little computer messages.
---
Do you use Power Patcher perk all the time or only to repair?
---
Spoiler. Same thing in every other Fallout, but wait a miminute look at all these people and characters running around. 
---
it has something to do with a quest faction, spoilers involved, dw you'll find out naturally in time
---
Also if someone makes a character and then decides not to use that character and makes. A new one I think that might count as not leaving the vault. 
---
I'm getting 200-220 with a two shot explosive hardened piercing handmade and my perk setup, without chems. Guess the TSE nerf didn't do much...
---
I agree. C.A.M.P. could and should be much better, but I feel like we, as a community, have been asking for a lot (not uncalled for..). BGS has to be swarmed by requests at this point, but we were PROMISED another stash increase, and we need it.
---
So much this. I get that the idea is there are no human NPCs and thus, a true city like Megaton would be a hard thing to put together but, that shouldn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt exist without them. Could even keep the concept of the robot vendors to make it a reality, maybe with the added fun of some sort of story to back up why the bodies of its prior residents pepper the area. By now, these sort of places would‚Äôve sprung up, even in this timeline. Moreover, the ability to build such a place would be fantastic. Have the community work together to build this sort of place. Designated spots in each server available through some sort of quest line that give the player the ability to add to existing structures other players have put in place, separate from camps, and with the opposite rules in place (specifically you can build attached to/on top of what‚Äôs already there). Sure, you may add to it and never be placed on that server again but each new login would be a new experience you could add to to make the cities unique.

Fits very well for my post-apocalyptic Ozzy Osbourne character.
---
I guess i'm never getting out of my t-60, as long as I can keep finding cores.
---
That was a bug according to Bethesda..
---
If you find something fun in the game it's a bug, of course. 
---
First Fallout game where I could not bring myself to give a single tenpenny fuck about any supposed story going on. I usually read listen to every piece of lore and story in a game, but in 76 I just mash through terminals. 
---
Bye.
---
What I don‚Äôt get is, you know it is a pvp game but you complain about the very limited pvp aspects. Did you not consider that a player looking for a fight might be better specced at pvp than you? Ignoring something like that does not seem like a good response. You had plenty of choices. Including blocking and server hoping. Or you could have stashed your junk and just used it as an opportunity to learn pvp. But ignoring it? That is not how pvp has worked in any game. Even in real life your choices are fight or flight. 
---
What you want is the ability to completely opt out of pvp. When they come out with a pvp server I will play on the pvp server. I am an older guy and not particularly good at pvp, but I like the adrenaline rush of the hunt and hunted aspect of pvp game play. I would really dislike if they eliminated or made pvp completely opt in.
---
For goodness sake it is slap damage. You literally stood there and used stimpack after stimpack....
---
Now i will have one less customer. But some fresh ingredients.
---
Maybe they outsourced capacities to Asia and they are still celebrating the new year?
---
Two places spawn plans at watoga, one in a boxcar west of the watoga station (usually on top of a crate next to a sitting skeleton), and the other is in the transit center level 3 locked room with the power armor and fusion generator.
---
There are a bunch of radioactive barrels on those tracks, rads get higher the closer you get to the tunnel
---
Going to change my name in 160years. Marketing.
---
This game sounds like it's just about grinding and nothing else. Why do people play it?
---
This PvP system is an experiment and has more to do with putting limits on PvP until they could be sure that the game would have a stable critical mass of players.  Survival mode is going to be hell on griefers. They won't be able to know where their targets are hiding their camps by just looking on a map.
---
Which is a result of spoiler a nuclear war. There's no difference between a human or a robot NPC. At least robots have a reason to repeat the same phrases and dialogue and monologues over and over again. Because they are programmed to. I like robots better than humans anyway, especially if they have some kind of sentience. Human NPCs in this game being on holotapes and terminals is fine with me. The amount of and quality of voice acting has nothing to do with lazy development. They could have easily attached those audio files to some human model. They chose not to, and I like the way they did it.
---
Power armour is very durable. Contrary to what some people say!
---
This game is like rdr online... BUT rdr 2 was on 2nd place in awards after gow... and red online Is A free exp for everyone who bought rdr2... fallout 76 in my opinion is more boring then red online which is in beta XD comedy
---
Yeah and it makes more sense to leave a vault or bunker and find everyone dead.
---
Wtf? Didn you read my post?
---
I ate like 100ppl already. Now i want to sell their tasty flesh to other human beings.
---
It's so wank, totally agree
---
A+ Story telling? This is some of Emils worst work. And I think that's really saying something. I was so off put by the way stories were delivered. You ALWAYS knew the ending. It was so predictable. The actual scripts were so bland. Not just in terms of the stories in quests but also the miscellaneous shit scattered around. 
---
Actual holotape in the game found at the mall parking lot
---
Guy one:
---
*I'm gonna get the girl I like flowers*
---
*oh no I got shot*
---
Guy two:
---
*I shot you. I'm gonna give her flowers instead. OK die now*. 
---
It's not a character achievement, it's an account achievement.
---
THE GATEKEEPING FANBOI. Your like a dark souls opener boss but with less friends, fewer sexuals prospects, more acne, and a pile of tendies to jealously guard. \*dodge rolls\*
---
I would go to r/gamingcirclejerk but its way more fun poking humorless cunts with a stick. Its especially more fun than the game I'm not currently playing.
---
Ow i‚Äôm so dumb. Thanks man!
---
This i want, order to murder my friend &lt;3
---
All other fallout games *cough cough* humans everywhere 
---
I disagree with almost all of your points. I have probably played just as long as you and I still have a ton to do. I enjoy the game on a daily basis. I didn‚Äôt rave through content. I didn‚Äôt eBay god mode. I didn‚Äôt exploit. I didn‚Äôt race through content. I didn‚Äôt farm at The Whitespring until I was a couple hundred levels. Because of that my game is not broken. I still have areas to discover on my main. I have yet to launch a nuke or enter a silo. I have other character builds that I am working on. Melee is not the only way to play the game. I enjoy my Sneak-Sniper very much. 
---
Maybe this is not the right game for you
---
This subreddit is actually filled with shills and fanboys. And they just can't take any criticism or diversity of thought. I love it when the really negative posts get hundreds of upvotes, even if I disagree mostly, I love it because I can just imagine their impotent rage.
---
I‚Äôve been paying $345 at white springs station for 1 bulk ballistic fiber just to keep repairing raider leg armor 2x a day. 
---
According to the developers, it doesn't, and never has. The nukes didn't kill the people, the Scorched did. So your argument is junk.
---
Don't report this shit, we need Bethesda to fix the real important things, the game it self us broken and u report shitty useless bugs!
---
I can't understand people like you.
---
Ah yeah you're right.
---
if you had 3 star White Knight to begin with, it went from 1 Ballistic Fiber to *2* when fixing
---
this isnt a big deal. Add Lucky Break and your armor shouldnt be breaking so quickly unless youre also not dealing any damage quickly enough to enemies. and/or youre not using Fix it Good to have 200% health on your armor as well
---
I dont use PA but the change in White Knight is not a big deal.
---
I take objection to your insinuation that aces nipple are anything thing less than dinner plates.
---
This was true for me until 3 Scorch Beasts attacked me as someone spawned in at the white springs golf course while I was inside it looting. In my sprinting, peeling run through the springs towards the station, an a assaultron stepped in front of one of my shots. It was the most fun I had in a while, total chaos and and explosions everywhere, and for the first time ever, I had to repair all my excavator armor.

HACKZ! CHEATERS! SPLOITZ!

Wow. Downvoted for pointing out a positive place. Wtf people? Let them be happy if they want, you dicks.
---
Wish it was onsale for pc.  Eur codes ate like 10 bucks on the various key sites, but US codes are still expensive.
---
r/murderedbywords
---
Interesting. How much u get out of that bulk!?
---
Oh ok...lol. That is pretty sad.
---
-Fanboi-
---
Is your health just super low when you took this, and maybe have that mutation that also increases dmg at lower health? Or any bobbleheads/chems? It‚Äôs a couple hundred higher than my tse lever action after this update (albeit at a hundred percent health and no supplements) - do you know why?
---
That‚Äôs fair. Those are just my observations. I don‚Äôt feel I rushed through either, and I certainly didn‚Äôt e-bay anything. 
---
Yup, and telephones and broken lamps I got the copper market locked down. 
---
If you just mash through terminals you might miss out on something that really captivates you!
---
They are asking what monsters we would want to fight and what kind of loot we would want to see drop. This games not even beta ready, and that tells me they had no plan going into launch on what this game should be about or how it should play out.
---
Since you go in with the knowledge that everyone is dead, its obvious that you know the ending to every story. The point is that you're discovering *why* these people aren't around any more, that is the ending to stories that you're looking for. 
---
To dance with a bear...on great time to change my underwear. Lol
---
Juicehead on YouTube. Pretty much the last reliable source of FO76 news
---
I hate PA too. Only use it to carry my fat ass during fast travel. 
---
Carnivore serum worked fine for me
---
Not to mention the containers called "scorch beast nest" all over them...
---
they were, and everyone was specifically hired for mobile games. It's the only reason I'm still being patient with them, because they're only experience is in a different engine, on a different platform, on a different scale entirely. They are out of their league, I'm not saying we should be patient with Bethesda at this point, but the people to be mad at are the higher ups not giving the team support, at least that's my opinion. 
---
Everyone is allowed to have their own opinion of course, and if you want to blame the devs, that's fair, there have been some mistakes made that just shouldn't have happened no matter what.
---
I just think, like what is the point of RDR Online? Hunt, fish or run the same missions over and over to make money to buy clothes, guns and horses? That is pretty boring.
---
I‚Äôm not BS‚Äôing you, but in that case it sounds like there‚Äôs also a bug
---
That is true. I've started playing Divinity Original Sin 2 though so that's all the captivating I need in an RPG.
---
&gt;transit center
---
Hmmm..
---
Thanks for the info, have got legs and torso, but still looking for arms, and also the wet-suit since it can be "lined".
---
But where is the  transit center ? :)
---
damn it man. I am really about to make a new account and buy this again. Maybe naming my account Johnny'); DROP TABLE activeusers; was not a bright idea.
---
It hasn‚Äôt been widespread yet, it‚Äôs only happened a few times
---
That could work, I was just thinking about some of the skeet shooting and other shot gun events I've seen where it seemed being agile was needed.
---
In that case that absolutely sucks. There‚Äôs definitely also a bug then
---
On PC? I'll sell for 3k each. I forget what the going price is.
---
Breaks the cardinal rule of film and game story telling. Show don't tell, all the cool shit happened before we got to experience it. 
---
Agree. The story is spot on and we'll acted.
---
That said it's the first act reclamation. Hopefully the second act will bring NPCs during the rebuilding phase. Communities of settlers more raiders etc.
---
Please Bethesda you can do it. The one on the harpoon gun works beautifully. (It‚Äôs the WWI style sight called ‚Äòreflex sight‚Äô, not the scope). 
---
The timeline is also much more advanced.
---
Yeah which makes total sense right?
---
Western most side of the city, busses out front its southern entrance. Benches for passengers on the right, reception desk and lockers on the left. The door is next to the lockers. Good luck and have fun.
---
Be honest, you don't just have to server hop 'a few times'. I've been there dozens and dozens of times and never seen any excavator plans/mods at that vendor. 
---
If you want them just buy the plans from Campden Park, you're guaranteed to see them there
---
Yeah nuclear wars don't kill people. You're right. Of course.
---
You didn't even read the post smh you just come here to be toxic go to bed child.
---
I miss NPCs.
---
All of you didn't read the post go home toxic noobs.
---
In the game. The nukes. Did not. Kill the people. According to. The people. Who made. The game. Idiot.
---
That makes absolutely no sense in any way imaginable. 
---
I never needed the plans, just picked up the hand mades I found and scrapped them for their mods.
---
The change in white knight REALLY wasn‚Äôt a huge deal at all. 
---
I enjoyed it way more when tse could one shot everything anything and just farm whitesprings all day
---
I only have trouble finding screws but it's not too horrible. I just make a run for 100 desk fans lol. I seem to find ammo pouches for ballistic fiber quite often. 
---
I thought it off a low level after an event for 50 caps
---
Think there is one always in a pond a bit down on the map from the solomods pond, will re check today :)
---
He is sitting straight in the middel of the pond if i remember correctly :)
---
oh right. Def not bitter over the nerf of the TSE you got through begging on the bazaar. I look forward to next weeks "this is boring &gt;:(" thread. 
---
Really?  After a short while of doing quests, it became obvious that the overseer wants us to nuke the scorched, but everyone else is dead, and my first thought was...
---
"Anyone who decides to do anything other than just go back and fix Vault 76 hasn't put even a moment's thought into it."
---
I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt actually see them saying that, any other dev company maybe but Bethesda literally has multiple SP titles with the fallout games that they could have fixed bugs and glitches in but they never really did.
---
Where are you finding cores? I've not come across one in 3 days. Every generator I come across that should have one already Seems to be removed it's driving me nuts.
---
sneak more, get hit less = problem solved
---
Yeah, the crashes are frequent. Not worth using until that is fixed.
---
"That's not how you balance a game."
---
Feels like it could be said about every attempt at "balance" they've done since the game was released.
---
backpedal harder baby
---
oh, that where it usually are two bot's coming out, think i know where you mean :) thanks...
---
Do you have the Power Patcher perk? It makes PA wear slower considerably, perhaps beyond 60% the rank 3 card says. If you also repair your PA above 100% with Fix it Good, the increased DR may elongate the wearing too as wear is applied for the damage after DR has been applied it seems. Also it is very dependent on the enemies you are fighting. Mine wears more in the Mire and Bog areas than in the Forrest.
---
Almost none in gennys. I have to do the grand tour of visiting PA spawn sites and taking the cores that way.
---
They've obviously moved on. There's no incentive for them to continue. 
---
Problem is that the recon sensors dont work either! Bought the mod...nothing..
---
I found him once in the cliff area west of Fort Defiance. He was floating there, facing the open world, looking down towards the Cranberry Bog. 
---
I like to think he was contemplating how lonely he was. Maybe contemplating how his mission wasn't worth it and how much he missed his mate. 
---
Just before I slid my combat knife into him, anyway. 
---
Just capture a power plant. That will give you all the cores you'll ever need.
---
It‚Äôs a skyrim joke 
---
Absolutely a crashing nightmare. I‚Äôve tried the targeting HUD on all power armors from Excavator to Ultracite, they all cause crashes on PS4 Pro. As soon as I removed it the crash stopped. When i put it back in it crashed again. Just horrible. Weird visual artifacts too. Mole miners are like walking in red skirts. Scorchbeasts have red wings. They should have simply used the thickened outline style of VATS instead of this faint shaded crap. 
---
And if you decide to screw me over, I string your entrails up like Christmas tinsel.
---
Well, not all the people. 
---
But yeah, most cities and population centers were attacked, but they didn't carpet bomb the whole US with nukes.  there were many pockets of survivors. 
---
most of Appalachia itself seems to have been spared from a direct hit. and as a result people pulled to gather and survived for 20 years, until the scorched appeared and killed\infected everything that was still alive.
---
But i feel like even in this case, we should still be finding pockets of people.
---
But here's the problem with that, what reason is there to maintain hope that someone, somewhere is alive? You spend the entire game getting asked to 'Help person X' and oh whoops, they died. Then at the end you get 'Now save **all** these people X'. Are they alive? Everything up until now points to no. What survivors? The only person you can infer is even still alive is the Overseer because her holotapes talk about what you are currently doing (and even then she never actually shows up).
---
Since you are talking about it from a 'what your character knows from information presented in the game' perspective are we supposed to all be roleplaying as some hopeless fanatic that is convinced despite all evidence that *someone*, *somewhere* must be alive?
---
Almost like different people have different experiences? Some people like the game and some don't. Both are fine. What OP is saying is It's bizarre people say they are quitting the game but this sub doesn't change numbers of members by much. It's nonsense.
---
I've had issues. I have stutter that's quite annoying sometimes. I crash about once every 10 hours. That's all I can think of.
---
This place is full of posts saying Bethesda messed up by reducing fusion core frequency. Next to posts saying power armour is too strong and to make there be less fusion cores. We all called for TSE to be balanced. Now it's been done people keep posting "I'm done after this patch" because they built their character around a broken weapon. People are different. You'll just have to deal with that.
---
Yeah, I forgot to add "anything but" to my second sentence, kind of entirely negating the point I was trying to make
---
Thank you for the encouragement to use the hunting rifle. Ill give it a go and save some caps.
---
Of course they have. They made astounding sales and broke player's trust, a lethal combo. This means they KNOW they won't see much more revenue later on, so they likely declared it a failure and moved on. It's not like they're obligated to pour company money into something unlikely to see much more return on their investment. 
---
Lost my large deathclaw gauntlet. FeelsBad 
---
did you died and then disconnected by the server perhapps?
---
Wait... are you arguing the Fallout universe isn‚Äôt realistic?
---
Are fucking kidding me?
---
*THIS*
---
I just want these changes. Nothing more for Enemys in F76 and Im fine with them.
---
Level 104 and Saw: 
---
3 Beehive enemys
---
2 Giant Sloths
---
1 Flatwoodmonsters
---
6 Grafton Monsters
---
around 78940 Scorched and Mutants
---
5 Gaint Hermids
---
20-40 Deathclaws and Gulpers and Wendigos
---
and 3141635 Protectrons and Sgt. Gutsys
---
I like the new Monsters like Grafton Sloth and Beehive ... but I dont want to google there fixed spawns to find them.
---
YoU dIdN'T eVeN rEaD tHe PoSt SmH yOu JuSt CoMe HeRe To Be ToXiC gO tO bEd ChIlD.
---
Considering how long it takes to add a 10 second cooldown for a monster attack, and considering that it took them two weeks, I'd say Dev Team is approximately 0.004 people.
---
I've said from day 1 that STR is objectively the best stat in the game period. Carry weight, only stat in game that directly increases damage, has perks for 4 different weapon classes. It's disproportionately good.
---
i loved that part of the camp, but cant give up my "house". great idea
---
Crossplay for the consoles would be fine but would not want it with PC because of the different input methods, different settings and hackers/cheaters.
---
Glad to hear you got it sorted friendo 
---
See, I fell bad, because I want to kill the SBQ, but I don't want to risk going over there to help and have that exact situation happen to you so I stay away and wait for the message that she is dead and go pick flowers.
---
Every time I've launched a nuke and spawned her, I have crashed. I just want to kill the stupid ****** already!!
---
Dude , you‚Äôre just unlucky , I‚Äôve buyed one yesterday from there . I‚Äôll not take my time to reply to this post one thing if didn‚Äôt tested myself . Just because you didn‚Äôt see it , doesn‚Äôt mean it don‚Äôt exist lol .
---
OP, when you catch up to the cargobot and fire a shot at it, it will stop darting and focus on you. So will the vertibirds with it so be prepared for a battle.
---
I turned footsteps audio down helped loads but it sounds off now
---
Ghouls had a specific genetic trait who after heavy radiation exposure mutated. Scorched are ghouls who were infected by the breath of the Scorchbeast.
---
I agree. That would be fun!  I find it much more entertaining to fight a big boss as a group.
---
Like a giant malformed globby blostfly boss the size of a bus.
---
Except stealth is broken at the moment.
---
probably one of the bros who tagged the queen ran up and took your loot
---
Yeah so like I said. I like that everyone is dead and the player wanders around to learn about what happened through holotapes and terminals etc. I don't want or care about human NPCs. OK?
---
Lol you‚Äôre too stupid to even say anything about all the stupidity you just spewed.
---
Only for the last kill I think? 
---
Funny how a subreddit can change. Posting criticism a month ago would have brought the fan boys rushing to defend Bethesda. Now, even the die hard fans are getting frustrated with all the shit. 
---
Bethesda should through the towel in and HIRE the Modders who fixed all their previous titles for them as staff to fix this game as well.
---
They are still in the game 
---
I have that honor. üòÅ
---
Dear scope crosshair. Why do you think being black is a good idea? I literally can‚Äôt see you 50% of the time against daytime objects and 90% of the time at night
---
Basically yeah. You can role play as anything you want, for sure. But by default, your character is either an older prewar wunderkind, or the offspring of two of them. They are the best and brightest, stored away to rebuild humanity after nuclear annihilation. And while I can't say for sure that the only mindset for someone like that is to seek out ways to help others survive, I can say that is the logical one. Finding and holding onto hope in all the hopelessness is the backbone of the story. 
---
So nuking giant bat lady to save people outside the region , that may also be dead, follows that theme. But like I said, as soon as you wake up, you control how your character acts and the decisions they make. And once you leave the vault you can retcon the entire vault expetience and be anything you want. But the world as we know it is dead, so all the stories and requests reflect that.
---
as a software developer, I'll tell you that they don't have many people working on this game at all. The simple things that they are fixing would take minutes for me alone. But they are having their entire studio fix them which is just hilarious. I'm talking about simple things like changing stats on a monster or how frequent the scorchbeast uses Sonic attacks. That's all programmed simply with a single modifier value. in other words, they probably have a skeleton crew of up to five people working on Fallout 76 at this point, and I would be amazed if they are working on it full-time with the rate that they are pushing out changes. 
---
Excactly. I don‚Äôt want to do any of these accidental quests. I‚Äôd like the immersion, though, if any is available. 
---
Look at GTA V online, that's a game with full, normal PvP on servers (with less reward for doing so) but if you opt out of it, you can't hurt others, they can't hurt you and you show up as a spectre on their end, so they know you're set to pacifist. I fail to see how this system would be bad for FO76, it can't be used in specifically PvP areas, and it can't be used while wanted, but it allows people to completely opt out of PvP
---
What resukts would that be?
---
yeah but didn't you buy two of them like most people in this thread?
---
action boy + marathoner
---
Theres honestly just one? Disappointing, I just assumed they took them out of the game because of programming issues. 
---
Yes. I have made this complaint since before the game shipped. 
---
The world Bethesda made is great, but it‚Äôs a fucking empty tomb. 
---
might be more, but that is the only one i have seen :)
---
Yes
---
the good thing is it's going to be F2P soon so people can enjoy it without even 35 or even 40
---
Its not a grind, it's a chore simulator. I spend hours and hours grinding Diablo 2 with nothing to show after and always have fun. This game need some DEVs who loves gaming.
---
I would like a world chat to inform people on my server of my wares. &gt;_&gt;
---
Good to know. I was going to replace targeting hud with recon sonsors. I would be pissed.
---
That's 1 bulk that nets you 10 ballistic fiber.
---
The subtitles are kind of shit though, because they are part of the UI... Bethesda‚Äôs weakest point. 
---
No, anyone who says they haven't had any issues is a liar or some casual that's like level 7 who played for a few hours and hasn't even played from the start. Shills are easy to spot. And if they want to wage war on their paying customers, there are a lot more of us than there are of them. And we like the David and Goliath story. The lone boy David against the giant Goliath mega corporations. 
---
We called for TSE to be balanced, and they nerfed every explosive and two shot weapon in the game into the ground, not to mention demolitions expert perk, and a few other stealth nerfs.
---
The more I play the game, the more I begin to solidly believe that ‚ÄúBethesda‚Äù has inserted several alternate carrot conspiracies to provide the illusion of depth and content. Timesinks with just enough little morsels that the OCD/Explorers/Fallout Faithful have enough ‚Äúevidence‚Äù that we in turn cling to this game until they can roll out content or release new games.
---
I say this reluctantly having spent literally hundreds of hours looking for secrets in this game, most notably evidence of SIMULATION THEORY, which I‚Äôve posted about here.
---
That said, I regretfully with your theories, my theories, and the theories of a few other posters believing there is hidden depth to the game we‚Äôre true.  I‚Äôd enjoy the game a lot more if so.  But after between 700-800 hours of hope and broken promises, I‚Äôve seen nearly all there is, and it is an illusion.  
---
Not a simulation like I‚Äôd hoped, and not a interconnected cult conspiracy, but a surface, shallow shell. 
---
Fallout is not trying to be strictly tram based pvp. It is an open world and open play style concept. If they did not include pvp aspects then the fanbase would be demanding it. I think nearly everyone agrees that the pvp can be improved
---
Wow wait... did u looked at your armor stats? did they stack??? i mean, take all off, hop in your PA, watch the stats, hop out, put on your weightless, hop in and did they stack to your PA stats??? if yes... that would be game braking XD (and another proof of the low quality programming of the FO76 team)
---
wait for your respond :))
---
I run into them occasionally at whitesprings.
---
Yeah. And where do the rewards all come from? Who gives them to you? 
---
I really don't understand this comparison mate. Like comparing fifa to battlefield.
---
Apex did pvp, anthem does the pve. Clock is ticking
---
Buff energy guns
---
It's that fence sitting.. the pvp is so nerfed it's just stupid.  There SHOULD have been multiple server types, instead of sitting on the fence, be everything at once in isolation...?
---
U answered ur own question. Make sure ur graphics card is updated, tweak settings u dont need
---
They still spawn frequently in the bog between the pylon and bog town, killed yesterday matter of fact 
---
I avoid queen fights where there are more than 8 people lining up as it makes her DR skyrocket and usually few people have ranged/anti-armor capability. Unfortunately, I had no choice for my own prime nuke where I wasted 5k regular ammo to have her down to about 45% health including the regen before running out of time with 9 other people. 
---
Honestly, I mostly fight the queen for the chance of thrill (like can she take me out while I shoot her on the ground with my vampiric gatling healing me back almost fully?) and not really for the plans or the 1 chance to get at most one legendary from the entire drop pool of 200 possible items.
---
Hopefully, they will make her drops more rewarding as indicated by the inside article.
---
Needs something wotking I really struggle to site enemies with the shitty sun glare in the cranberry bog and at night...berry mentats work so why can't they sort this out.
---
Everyone's dead Dave.  Everyone. There all dead. Everyone's dead Dave, everyone's dead!
---
not just excavator... will happen with other pa sets too
---
Yeah they fixed that one pretty damned quickly, didn't they?
---
Yes, I guess it could be. But you can see objects marked as "Scorchbeast Nest" near the "clusters", which makes me think they are two separate things. I mean, did the SB gathered all that concrete, tubes and all? Did it enter the building to make the "beehive"? Did it put the faces? The faces seem to be not part of the building. Also, don't SBs live underground?
---

WHAT fallout brotherhood of steel is the BEST fallout game of all the games
---
Funny how you expect most people to still give a shit about something that got patched in over a week ago at 8am on a Saturday. 
---
OCD/Boredom/Brand Loyalty.
---
But I cannot do so any longer without meaningful changes.
---
Yes, that style is common in Fallou in general. I find it odd that the face in Dunwich Borers also appear in the Lucky Hole Mine. Maybe it's nothing, maybe there's a connection... =]]
---
Yea Im thinking of avoiding doing the queen too. But then this means I don't have much else to do in the game other than pvp
---
Pre patch repairs with a max white knight took one ballistic fiber each. Post patch it takes two. Someone call the UN and report this human rights violation. 
---
I like to think that the sight is for *mounted* use and that's why its inaccurate for us. Its design for a shooter look straight down the barrel and not having to support the entirety of the gun.
---
No why in the world my character would custom make a sight he can't use while holding the gun against his hip, the only way in which he can use it, is beyond me. Lol
---
Break it now, piss off a few people but a lot won't even notice, and then fix it later and talk about how great you're doing addressing the issues.
---
running around with guns.
---
Everyone's dead Dave.  There is no engagement in the world.
---
Not really. I'm only still on the subreddit as I hope the game can be saved. I don't hold much hope though.
---
Exactly! It's alive and there's also a strange metallic hum... hopefully we'll see more of it! =]]
---
Good for you!   Enjoy the new game and best wishes!
---
I just played connect four. It's everything chess was trying to be.
---
Devs don‚Äôt care, they already got your money
---
I lost a swing speed boxing glove once, but I'm pretty sure that I accidentally dropped it.
---
It really is.  It's far more engaging then dead bodies.
---
I have noticed though that if there are alot of ppl in the event(as in almost 3/4 of the people on a full server), the queen may get really strong but it seems that she drops slightly better loot or at least a higher chance of getting a 3*
---
I found plans at Harper's Ferry, in the building south of the Vendorbot, on the second floor which is accessed by Traincar (or Marsupial,) next to the gate. The gate is the powered red gate nearest the spawn point.
---
Bye Felicia.
---
Go is everything chess hoped to be.
---
In Professor Farnsworth voice "I'm sad now."
---
And if you're on PS4, I can show you where I found them, however it is a "Randomized" open-world plan spawn, so success is not guaranteed.
---
People are pointing that out to me. I guess it could be. But near the clusters you can find a searchable object called "Scorchbeast Nest". This, and the faces, makes me think they are separate things.
---
&gt;But by default, your character is either an older prewar wunderkind, or the offspring of two of them. They are the best and brightest, stored away to rebuild humanity after nuclear annihilation. And while I can't say for sure that the only mindset for someone like that is to seek out ways to help others survive, I can say that is the logical one. Finding and holding onto hope in all the hopelessness is the backbone of the story.
---
This is called railroading and it is incredibly lazy in a personal-character RPG. You are 'Handyman X' and you *will* do these specific things in this specific way. Everyone gets the same story, the same forced motive, the same outcome.
---
Sounds good to me! I really enjoy Fallout lore, so I read and listen to everything as well. I'm sure we'll be doing a whole lot of standing around when we team up. It may be a couple of days before I can play again, but I'll add you as soon as I get back online.
---
That's plenty.
---
Lol but really OP, why compare these games? They have nothing in common and do not compete in any way.
---
Having said that, game looks cool
---
And fallout 2, where they got it from. 
---
I disagree completely. No comparison between the 2. 
---
I am glad you asked I didnt think to check.
---
They dont stack, but since weightless is the only buff I cant say if the buffs are active or not.
---
The people who would defend Bethesda have left for other subs because they‚Äôre tired of the constant hate on this sub. They‚Äôre not frustrated with the game, they‚Äôre frustrated with all the whining in this sub.
---
I agree, I have it and I don't have to repair my armor that often, I don't get people saying they have to repair theirs 2 or 3 times a day, I repair mine maybe once a week and I don't mind having to go collect junk to repair it when needed it's part of the game.
---
And it's free to play.
---
Something fo76 should have been.
---
Try it!
---
Does Apex legends have gouls ? If not then I hope it's in early access until then can get their shit together 
---
How about horde events have giant bosses for a group challenge 
---
&gt; That's plenty.
---
It certainly isn't plenty of engagement.  The lost boy in the park? dead. The overseer's fiance? dead, then undead, then you kill the undead.
---
DEAD.
---
Everyone's dead.
---
I like this. The idea of watching someone trying to kill me then realizing I have passive on, dying, then coming back with a wanted level makes me chuckle. Frankly, I think that's how it should work.
---
FO76 tried to be a battle royale game?
---
Meh I will eventually. Division 2 beta is what I'm playing now, and it IS what fallout 76 should have been 
---
thanks for the blogspog and making me aware that any game where you carry a gun is basically the same! #defnotsadandwantingattention
---
No doubt...crazy gun
---
that should have been bethesda's angle.  Instead it'll be some new pvp mechanic where you can drag your level 250 player in to kill fresh level 1's.
---
If you‚Äôre on ps4 and are looking for some backup, I have Saturday off and it would be fun to go through that quest again. 
---
Is it whining, or criticism? I mean, people keep pointing out things that need to be fixed, instead, they nerf another perk or mechanic. (Granted TSE was in need of some changes.)
---
I actually find the story far more interesting this way.  It's like Myst.  
---
You're not supposed to be invested because "the peepeelz needz meh!"  You're supposed to be investigating the things that went wrong so that they don't happen to you too.  
---
Each piece of the individual stories is a puzzle piece.  The Vaccination.  The Signal Repeater.  The Lures.  The Ultracite discovery.  Even the truth about AMS, the Enclave, and the Scorchbeasts.  All of these come together to create a greater whole.
---
I get mystified when people say they didn't see the same themes and elements that I have seen.  But this happens in films and tv shows too, there's just certain patterns and elements that I find are part of the human experience that should resonate as universal.   I suppose it's subjective paradigm.
---

---
I don‚Äôt know what you are taking about, but I suggest you get your meds immediately. 
---
&gt;Consider your audience. We are not Bethesda, we do not care.
---
Wow shit. Better go and let the mods know to take down the [Feedback Sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/). I mean, we aren't Bethesda so why do we care? Stick it in an e-mail right?
---
Is't it obvious? then they lost heart after killing the NPC's.  Why else is the map so big?
---
For terminal quests to find dead bodies?
---
#icaretoo
---
2 workshops. Munitions use to be 500 an hour and they nerfed it to 250 an hour. Either amount can be expended in less then 2 minutes. Unless they fixed the nerf and i missed something.
---
I learned dense from scrapping for marine and leather. Had to buy it for combat armor tho. 
---
I got the Division on the steam sale (remember steam????).  Although I only played it on the xbox and it was... boring.
---
deleting threads doesn't erase the history :(
---
Balancing an issue by removing the only solution?
---
The raiders all died too(well, got turned into Scorched most likely).
---
The best parts of the game in my opinion are when dealing with the two somewhat alive characters, Rose and Modus.  I really enjoyed the game, but there is something to be said for enhancing story telling through actual characters, not just recordings and terminals.  Imagine if there were a few that were actually alive.
---
Acting like a child is not being an adult, maybe you should take some of your own advice, sorry that actually playing the game is too much for you too handle, screws and ballistic fiber are not that hard to find, but if you never go looking because you think you shouldn't have to that's nobody's fault but your own.
---
Cool. Game went through years of changes and is nothing like when it released. Sequel improved on almost every aspect
---
They don't stack, it's just the bad engine not keeping up. It'll say that with other armors too, so there's no defense or stat stacking (my weightless armor has less item weight too, so whenever I get into PA, I'm overencumbered because those effects turn off)

Who are the 'main Bethesda guys'? Montreal? Dallas?
---
I think I've seen a CAMP built in the Pioneer Scout Camp's buses.
---
There's also a super cool crashed monorail to the south of RobCo that would be an awesome place to build, if it weren't for the fact that it's pretty far from any vendor except Harper's Ferry and Watoga.
---
Every fallout has done it. 
---
Fallout: You are a vault dweller. You need to fix the water chip. You need to end the super mutants.
---
Fallout 2: You are a pornstar. You need to seduce a dog and blow up the enclave.
---
Fallout 3: You are an immigrated vault dweller. You need to find your father. You need to filter some water.
---
Fallout New Vegas: You are a mailperson. You need to find who shot you. You need to determine the fate of the region.
---
Fallout 4: You are a prewar human. You need to find your son. You need to determine the fate of the region.
---
It's not railroading. It's setting up a story in case you don't want to role play every aspect of your character. There is nothing preventing you from following the story presented in 76. You can jump around it completing quests at random.
---
Your processor may be a bottleneck.  
---
I have it running on a w3680 (6c/12t): at 3.4Ghz I get some fps drops, but performance is nice an steady at 3.9-4.0Ghz
---
Yeah, prepatch, with white knight 3 and lucky break 1, I went 80 levels without my armor ever breaking. Post patch, I've had to repair it once so far. This is completely unreasonable in a survival game where gear maintenance is an intended mechanic!
---
Alright great, thanks. I'll go and give these a check :)
---
I'll have to see where to get a beta key, in the meantime, another 45GB to download.
---
I team up before I head to the nuke zone. It doesn‚Äôt stop server drops but at least you can get back to it yknow. 
---
They're still there - they are just rare.  I didn't see one until well past the 150 hour mark, near the Abandoned Bog Town.  I believe there's a place off the beaten path in the Savage Divide where one is either guaranteed or simply more likely to show up.
---
&gt;	with no real story behind it. 
---
No matter, people will happily provide it. 
---
Aw, man, don't give up yet! Let's see what they come up with the DLCs. I think is still early to think that way! Did you see the "emanating" shrines? https://twitter.com/ZeroFoxFK/status/1092154777352445953 I think that's something new. The "mothman cult" stuff is everywhere, I think it's the ace they have up their sleeves. They promised us a game with longevity, I think they planned a lot of stuff and had to add some hints of it since the beginning, like the terminal entry about being a simulation (which I still think is the BEST theory) and all the occult shrines. It's been what, 3 months since release? Let's be a bit more patient. If the first DLC sucks, then I'll join you! ahhaha =]]]
---
Workshops kinda do it, but it‚Äôs temporary.  
---
If you have a team, claim it, build and log out.  Next guy on your team takes over and continues.  You can do this for awhile as the budget is pretty big.
---
Agreed, the cost of ballistic fiber went from 1 to 2, and you can find loads of it in silos/Firebases. Screws are even more plentiful, yet people act like this nerf is the end of the world. 
---
In other Fallout games you had choices, or at the very least the illusion of choice. YOU need to determine the fate of the region. Do you determine it in Fallout 76? Nope. In Fallout 76 you are just a tool of the narrative. You are one of those guys that the main character assigns to a companion mission from a bounty table somewhere. You will do this thing while other stuff happens that you don't see, and when you get back things will have progressed and then you can go off and do something else.
---
Yep, and I probably dropped mine. Probably. No idea since we can't toggle items as suggested.

The CPU is around 50% load when the fps crashes. Why do you think  it's cpu related?
---
You farm it in the Cranberry bog military camps (the stars). Every military camp has ~pieces of ballistic material (duck-tape or ammo bag). 
---
Camp MCclintock is a low lvl area that also has a few ballistic ammo-bags in the locker on the right as you enter the main building, with the Mr. Gutsy on the left on a shelf next to a Overseer cache and there's duck-tape on the second floor on a small table. The final ammo bag is in the Barracks in the very back.

Look at the atom shop. Don't you just want to spend real money on that garbage? A pink suit? Paint splashed metal armor? Vault Tec BS? Yeah I just can't help myself but to get out my credit card and start buying shit. On eBay.

This is very constructive. Love it.

They're down one guy for coffee breaks, and every office has a useless person, so down to three now.

Thanks, could you give me some more details?
---
They weren't purchased to make mobile games you're thinking of Bethesda Montreal 
---
Austin used to be battlecry studios who has a few higher ups that worked on Star Wars galaxies back in the day 
---
In every video game you play as a tool of the narrative. Thats the point of playing. Your action progress the story. The difference with 76, is that it is an online game. Your experience and progress doesn't equal everyone else's experience and progress. That is why, hopefully, new content that progresses the bigger story will come along. 
---
It will be there.  Patch #5 changed it so these plans are always available at their respective vendors.  Before, you needed to be below a certain level for it to even show up, which is why many low-level players like you would make their trek to Harper's Ferry as soon as they could.
---
Hard Bargain sort of pays off in the long run, once you get to the point where you're taking in more things than you use and can resell things like chems, water, and bulked junk.
---
I'm running on an old xeon as well.... cpu usage stays at \~50% 
---
"at 3.4Ghz I get some fps drops, but performance is nice an steady at 3.9-4.0Ghz" 
---
The problem is: I‚Äôve played since beta non-stop.  There is no end-game content.  It‚Äôs nearly impossible to find people to group with.  There has been 0 content released since Beta, which includes the pre-finished vaults which are normally inaccessible.  Hell, some of the terminal entries in these locations even say, ‚Äúto be written.‚Äù
---
I wanted to believe.  But belief is not enough.  At some point, you, and I, shouldn‚Äôt have to create our own diversions and theories.  It‚Äôs fun, for a time, but there‚Äôs nothing worse than unrealized plots and inclusions,  I can‚Äôt devote more time to false promises and false content hints, without payoff.  
---
Xbox. Gave up after a while last night. Finally able to wear my 60,so figured I'd do it in style while not sinking money into the atom shop
---
that makes me smile, so much for so little. =)
---
yes! It's an excellent 1080p60fps machine!
---
Instigating Rolling Pin. &gt;8(
---
I agree with you. The reason I kept joking sbq fights was to get the mats for a decon arch. Most of the loot I get is crap or not usable for my build. If we got cap value equal to what the items were worth, I wouldn't mind picking it up to vendor but the caps we get is pitiful 
---
There is one in the mountains to the right of WhiteSpring consistent spawn I farm him often sitting in a lake or pond by some radioactive waste and a blue pipe 
---
Ummm no it wasn't actually. And I tried it. To me Apex is another wannabe fortnite. Both in which are garbage games imo.
---
My health was at 20% when I took this, and I do have adrenal reaction. no chems or bobbleheads, just perks. The fact that you can get it up to 700 means you can snipe anyone with it and one shot them. Tse are uselesss now, the fact that it turns a weapon explosive means anyone with fireproof lvl 3 will take no damage from tse.
---
36 shots. Damn!
---
I've had this bug once and I had 3 shots. I saved it for a Scorchbeast and was satisfied killing it with a 3-shot volley.
---
The bug was a result of firing, quickly switching to another weapon, firing and reloading. But I've never been able to recreate it, so I don't know how it works. 
---
My black powder weapons do tend to reload themselves sometimes, when quickswitching and reloading other weapons (I do the pirate style gunplay - fire, switch, fire, switch with flintlock guns).
---
I'm on PC and I've worn my Excavator Targeting HUD since BETA and I only get a client crash that might be related to Targeting HUD about once per four hours of play. To me, it's worth it for the ability. Since I DC or client crash about once an hour, this possible Targeting HUD related crash is only about 25% of the interruptions I experience.
---
Oh snap lol

My GT is vashgun on ps4.

Twin lakes, follow the lakes down to a small pond area with a water pump and some barrels of nuclear waste.

Yo dawg, I heard you like asset flips.

So I asset flipped your asset flip

It was a cash grab, if you keep it up to date and actively worked on then you're doing it wrong

You do just enough to keep the vocal minority optimistic and jebait them along

Damn. Why am I not surprised?
---
Run to the gazebo and they can't get in. Also a water fountain there which removed diseases.
---
The comparation isn't relative, no man's sky doesn't compare at all with the case of fo76. They lacked content but had a good start on the actual game... while fo76 had problems with glitches, textures, and the crap that the company decided to do on costumers. Even though there are no real npc's there is still content to see. Just saying you can't compare No man's sky as the reclamation day of fallout76, they both are 2 different cases. With that said have a good day/nigh.
---
At that graveyard, there are tombstones with "Activate" options that don't seem to do anything. You didn't happen to figure out what they do, if anything, have you?
---
I doubt he will miss out on anyting. I've paid uncomfortable attention to the quests and they are all incredibly fucking boring
---
In the game, causes 50% of melee damage done by the attacker to bounce back at the attacker.
---
In real life, is a series of plates on a tank with explosive charges underneath that blow the plate off against enemy shells and missiles, reducing the damage.
---
Oh, I understand the frustration and I'm there with you. It was hard for me to get past the no-NPCs thing and the unresponsiveness of everything. But eventually I did and started to study the world. I still maintain that it's too early to toss the game aside, but yeah, a little more content, and I mean story-driven content, could have helped the launch. They need to understand that Fallout fans are explorers more than fighters. We need more coop and more lore, not more PVP. But again, 3 months is very little in gaming developing, especially with a game this size, so I'm still giving them the benefit of the doubt. Hopefully, you and I will be discussing more concrete stuff after the DLCs. =]]]
---
It‚Äôs funny that you say that, because I‚Äôm not the only person to have made the comparison.
---

This article was not the basis of my post, but l believe it‚Äôs a great read.  It was written prior to the launch of Fallout76.

Yea that‚Äôs not what it said last night

remember, when using hyperthreading 50% thread load is actually more like 100% physical processor load

Well, I wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre useless - still decent pve weapons especially if you aren‚Äôt playing at low health. Usually just doing pve myself, anyway. Tse isn‚Äôt the best stats anymore, but still better than most attributes.

But thanks for responding - just curious to make sure I haven‚Äôt missed any good dmg amplifiers. 
---
Tal0nkyl0r
---
I'll add you when I get on
---
That's still quite bad price. 
---
I paid maybe 35 euros for the PC after playing for free on beta. Don't bother to check, about that much. I wonder how many played the game on beta, because it seemed to me you could play the game plenty enough, to make an informed decision about whether or not to actually pay for the game.
---
Right now it's 10 euros on the cdkeys site I brought it. Or 25 euros from Gamestop, which includes about 6 euros of VAT.
---
"the only people you see will be real"  but what about robots, ghouls, and super mutants?  it's not like there couldn't have been interesting NPCs, but no, we get one "intelligent" super mutant, like 2 interesting robots, and zero ghouls...  this game would be a million times better with just the addition of NPCs
---
The problem lies in the inability to find ballistic fiber. Had they increased the means of finding it. That nerf would be 100percent balancing
---
Ok, so I said about what my issues are above. If you're having other issues that I'm not; am I a liar because I'm saying I'm not having the same issues? You're coming accross very hard line calling anybody without problems liars.
---
Although I do kinda wonder if people are making up problems sometimes when their experience is so much worse, so perhaps I'm a bit guilty of that too but in reverse.
---
I disagree about TSE being 'Nerfed into the ground'. It's still the best weapon set in the game! I still say it should never have been a possible combo and badly needed to be balanced. The fact everybody wanted them speaks volumes.
---
My play through usually breaks before I get through Roses's quests.
---
My camp is by Fort McGlintock for this exact reason. First and last thing I do is raid this place daily for ammo bags and clipboards. Not because I want to but because I have to...
---
Ok I'd be happy to give you some pointers etc..
---
Agree with this guy... No Man‚Äôs Sky also was/is a tiny team with an ethos... FO76 coming from quite a different place...
---
That amount of ammunition can be expended in 5 seconds with heavy weapons.
---
I‚Äôve been looking for weeks, harpers sells marine which I‚Äôve bought many times can‚Äôt find combat...:(
---
This is what is happening. My hypothesis is that the client does not keep track of nodes that you harvested after the cell unloads client-side.
---
Well if you didn't write it why post it? Look I don't say that it isn't 100% a bad comparation, but no mans was a more different case (starting off that hello games was a new company) I am not defending Bethesda here either hello games, as they both are still a disappointment to me. But still
---
I meant it to be funny. But by the looks of things, considering how more awful they managed to make an already lackluster game, I've got to imagine that this reflects the work of their C or D team doing all the work at this point.
---
Again, no idea what you are talking about.  I don‚Äôt mind, per se, about being blamed for giving away TSE weapons, but you‚Äôve got the wrong guy.  I think you‚Äôre trolling. 
---
You‚Äôre using the outside evidence of someone in the real world though. In-game, there‚Äôs no way to know everyone is dead except to search for them. Like it‚Äôs literally the storyline, it‚Äôs not pretending at all. 
---
Another point to make here, is that "the illusion of choice" doesn't make it any different from "no choice". You're 100% right, every game has left the story in this way to some degree. Hell, very few games don't have a "railroaded" storyline. Hell, even Bandersnatch on Netflix had a railroaded story. It just didn't look like it did. No matter what, you always reach the same destination in the end to achieve the true ending. It honestly feels like the other guy is trying really hard to just hold onto the idea of the story making zero sense and horribly constructed. But, the problem in the end, isn't a bad story. Or a "railroaded" one. It's just as you said here, content. And definitely, hopefully they expand on the story and progress it beyond the killing of the Queen.
---
I'm not having any stealth issues but I also use a piece of chameleon armor. 
---
Because there's no guarantee you will both be logged on at the same time on the same server every time. 
---
The plans are approx  6000 - 7700 depending on your Charisma and hard bargain. I have seen them in Camden park and with Greg in Grafton. Hadn't seen the mods for sale - I'll have to watch for that now as I cant afford the plans and need them also.
---
Thanks for replying. Not sure if you're saying the cpu is or isn't the bottleneck?
---
I can't stand posts like this. The gaming Community as a whole has turned into a whiny, piss mouth bunch of entitled morons.
---
I'm over level 100 and I can count on one hand all the times that I've ever needed to repair my gear.
---
Just like TSE it was overpowered. I shouldn't be able to go 40 levels without ever repairing my gear. 
---
It is a survival game. Things shouldn't be easy. Stop relying so much on crutches. 
---
ah, thanks. did not come to mind. need to check if that socket can fit something with more frequency then, as overclocking is not an option. :/
---
I've only repaired my armor a handful of times since I started playing, I guess it's harder for melee characters because they kind of have to be up close but I truly have ballistic fibre to the brim in my stash. Never understood why people had so much trouble repairing armor.
---
I don't think fallout 76 was intended to be a PVP but more cooperative game. At least this is why I played the game. You can‚Äôt actually say that the game tried to be mainly PVP when it is actually not. Having PvP restrictions removed is easy but would it really still be the way many player want? PVP beta is coming out on March if I remembered correctly. Just hope they don‚Äôt mess it up for their sake.
---
I took a look at some of the related "faces cult conspiracy" videos, and LOL. The games have all featured a few Lovecraft references, which were nothing more than fun easter eggs. And the faces are nothing more than reused assets. It is funny and instructive to see a mythology grow up around completely meaningless and disjointed random crap.
---
Not sure why you got downvoted. This is the best way to get fully charged cores. Plus you get good loot from the powering up x power plant quest. Once you have the power plant workshop up and running it cranks out 100% cores faster than a water purifier spits out water so clean you cant cook with it.
---
I experience something like the damage bug using melee but it seems to be when stuff is lagged up, like it hasn‚Äôt registered that I hit.  However if it‚Äôs a legendary starred MOB, that‚Äôs a feature - it healing up.
---
This is the most succinct and hilarious post on this entire ludicrous thread.

I don't even care about TSE, but some people only have one of those legendary effects. Some people don't even have any of them and their damage was affected by these carpet bombing nerfs to all explosive damage. I didn't say you in particular, but some people are trying to present this image that everything is fine, when it's not. If everyone was like them then the game would just be losing players without any feedback. Every negative comment, every whine, every complaint, every rant, every post saying "I'm quitting" is valid feedback. Raph Koster writes about criticism [here](https://www.raphkoster.com/2013/10/14/on-getting-criticism/). 
---
&gt;**Everyone who dislikes your work is right.**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;This is the hardest pill to swallow. I‚Äôve never gotten a piece of feedback that was wrong. You see, you can‚Äôt deny a player their unique experience. Whatever they felt, was true. For them. And *something* in your work triggered it.  
---
&gt;It is useless, and worse, actually self-defeating, to attempt to deny the critique. Sure, there are sometimes reviews that seem spiteful, unfair, and the rest. But the vast majority of the time, people are giving their honest reaction.
---
idamnedit on ps4. I am a melee build and can assist if that is your interest. 
---
And new lamp posts!
---
We sent a team in to Bethesda to look for the developers, but only found some holotapes and a robot named Rose.
---
A. I love your name.
---
B. Most of the interesting stuff, aren't a part of any quests. They're side things hidden in holotapes or in notes and terminals. Things that tell their own story unrelated to your main objectives or even side objectives. That's how it's been since 3, I personally found. Exploring different areas, learning what happened there through notes and terminal entries. Or delving into vaults and learning about the experiments done. That was far more intriguing than any main or side questline, regardless of which fallout game is being played. A good example of this, is Oxhorn's lore videos. Shows just how much stuff there really is that is missed when all you do is focus on the quests and what not.
---
While thank you for your time, still a good post 
---
I am nearly positive that in FO4 you could get stuff like that from scrapping weapons, Alps the scrapper perk in FO4 was to get more materials out of common scrap items like phones or typewriters.
---
I'm pretty sure that the cpu is your bottle neck.
---
I can get a cpu bottleneck on my system, which at stock frequency has similar performance to yours, but when I overclock I can eliminate it.
---
Maybe upgrading to a hex-core cpu, 1650v3, would solve your issue.
---
Wow more levels that don't mean anything because you can level up infinitely
---
The ones in Maryland.
---
Also hello games cared about the backlash enough to fix it.
---
There is no PA cap, PA just buffs you to 11 if you ate below that.
---
That literally is the problem. It's bad story because it is so shallow. You say the problem is content. That content **is** the story. Go and kill the scorchbeast queen for...reasons. Oh and you don't get any options along the way about how you do it, which faction you enlist or anything.
---
Like new life after a cataclysm, realization begins to dawn in the heart of madness
---
10 piece of ballistic fiber scrap. It fixes raiders left leg and right leg. Then it‚Äôs done. 
---
Plans are also at watoga 
---
shoot, those are not exactly cheap!
---
That's why this is so frustrating. ESO has its problems sure, but things were never this bad. 
---
Whitesprings is'nt as much of a dungeon as it's just 3 open buildings crammed with ghouls. You can run past all 3 buildings, gather them in a fat pile and just blow them all up at once, that's not really a dungeon to me :/ It needs progression, ideally a puzzle or two and a few enemies at a time separated through the dungeon.
---
What is this "Skyrim," friend citizen?  
---
Than, not then. Than is used for comparison, while then is used for sequencing.
---
I've acquired Dense mods (not plans) for Robot and Marine Armor.  The former I found at Camden Park.  I think I found the latter in Harper's Ferry or one of the Watoga vendors.  They seem to be random.  I ended up buying them, even though I don't have Legendaries of either, just in case I eventually find something special.
---
I'd love to find it for Combat Armor.
---
if your on pc and dont wanna run around looknig anymore i'll sell ya a the plans for 500 each
---
^ this
---
You can downvote my comment and say it isn't true all you want, but I've spent 20+ hours and datamined the ESM with xEdit and custom scripts to get all the plans and recipies, all the weapon and armors, their mods and scrapping learn chances, and put it all together into a spreadsheet and that in a Reddit post with more than 500 upvotes. What evidence do you have to the contrary?

---
Multiplayer took two years to be added (release was August 2016, ‚ÄúNext‚Äù Patch was August 2018), which also fixed a lot of the content issues and was in essence a relaunch. 
---
Haha glad to help!
---
The thing is Im not sure if the armorer perk is bugged or not making armor unbreakable. Ive had my bos combat armor on for weeks it seems now since its first repair with a maxed armorer perk and have been through multiple scorched earth events, countless scorchbeast attacks, beat to shit by super mutants and their sledges. One would think Id have to have repaired my stuff by now but all my armor pieces are still sitting in the extra white bars.
---
since patch i hvnt seen a single dense plan, also bos combat plans seem to have gone among a few others like shadowed and deep pocketed for some armor types. i can mod all if ppl want
---
Oh ok good bye bye then 
---
I disagree. With the Atom Shop being a cash grab, the goal should be to maintain a playerbase that you can milk.
---
However, this is a failed cash grab scheme. They can‚Äôt close it now because they‚Äôd get sued, so they have a skeleton crew
---
That's not how that works. The changing loot list is just server lag populating your list wrong.
---
There's also a few military ammo bags in the live-fire range where you shoot down a bunch of commy robots at Camp McClintock. Every now and then I fast travel to Vault 76 then run over there to stock up on ballistic fiber.
---
But... why server hop when you can just buy them outright in Camden Park? What's the point?
---
&gt; I get mystified when people say they didn't see the same themes and elements that I have seen. 
---
Same. Fallout 76 isn't a drama - it's a murder mystery. Don't know why people don't seem to be able to embrace that. the whole point is to learn what happened (and prevent it from happening again) by listening to the voices of the dead.
---
The R&amp;G vendor DEFINITELY has a slightly random set of furniture plans. I was looking for the ‚ÄúPlan: Safe‚Äù and he had Cafe Tables, after a server hop he had Long Rustic Bench, another hop he had Suitcase, another hop he had Electric Chair. I‚Äôm level 209, Xbox platform.
---
If you harvest them, leave hte area and come back they will "respawn" but you can't harvest the ones you have already harvested again.
---
I remember seeing the Blackbird PA paint for the first time. 1800 (20 bucks, or 10-15 if you have some atoms saved up) limited to 1 day. It's MTX bait, plain and simple. 
---
If it were 1 week, it would be hard but not literally impossible. 
---
Just check the cpu use when standing in this corner of the bunker:
---
[https://i.imgur.com/SkrNCZj.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/SkrNCZj.jpg)
---
CPU is at 30% or under, GPU is doing ok too - but frames hit massive low and stay there until I move elsewhere. Spots like this are really everywhere.
---
Not much to wonder 
---
Montreal is working on elder scrolls blades for phones 
---
Austin is working on this game 
---
Maryland is working on elder scrolls 6 and starfield 
---
This isn't anything new and is pretty common knowledge if someone was to use google search 
---
Or some realization that no one is listening from Bethesda and they don't give a damn about our suggestions.
---
sick, is that an N64  game?!
---
I know I'm still looking for that tool chest plan.
---
thank you! have you checked the screen shot I just posted?
---
Jesus actual fuck, dude. We aren‚Äôt talking about the characteristics of mid-century vehicle design and the transition between modern and post-modern architecture. We‚Äôre talking about fucking flies on rotten meat. Making them glow isn‚Äôt going to give the art director a conniption, and if it does, they need firing. 
---
For reasons? Weren't the reasons made clear to you? You're killing it to end the source of all the other scorchbeasts. To take a huge step in stopping the aforementioned plague.
---
Content, yes. Like I said. Which, you took out of context clearly because it was also stated in that same sentence: "hopefully they do expand on it". You're literally agreeing with my statement, acknowledging the real issue being story content. Not any of the other problems you've stated. It's lacking substance. It is otherwise, a great idea. And fits the setting wonderfully.
---
Be honest with me here, are you trying to have a genuine debate on the matter or are you just trying to bash everything about the game based on some biased nonsense? If you don't like it, and don't know how to explain why it's a problem? Just say "I dislike it, and that is my opinion on the matter." You don't need a reason, and you don't need to prove yourself to anyone here. We're random strangers on the internet. But another thing you need to realize, is this game isn't Fallout. Not comparatively to the past games. It isn't meant to be looked at under the same scope as past games. It is an experiment at best, branded under the fallout name, with fallout themes. It would be like comparing two different genres of music. Like, Metallica and Our Lady Peace. You can't really compare them, because they appeal to different groups, and are composed in very different ways. And that seems like what you're doing here with fallout. Trying to compare it to the past installments. It's not a fair comparison. Just be patient, and wait. Online games always get expansions onto their story and progression. Because that is how Online RPGs work. Not like single player where what you see is what you get right off the bat. Patience is key, and not expecting immediate satisfaction.

---
‚Ç¨300 second hand :/
---
Can you take workshops and gather resources to build a base, and can you launch nukes and can you get overpowered weapons and armor that make it almost like godmode? No? Well it's not quite Fallout 76 then.
---
right right, just the middle man.
---
ITS GRAFTON DAY! 
---
Every damn time I just want to visit the train station vendor, that damn voice.
---
Every time.
---
Dead horse is a dead horse uninstall the game and just leave and don‚Äôt return here 
---
Yes, it's a win-win situation. You get plans, resources, event xp and 8 fully charged cores every hour.
---
Ohhhhh, so *that's* why they want suggestions on the forums instead of sifting through hateful drivel posing as a suggestion. 
---
Also, maybe you're playing wrong? Regular armor is ideally relegated to a stealth build, use the legendary affixes with little durability loss. Also, not wasting loads of fusion core energy while using VATS is a major plus.
---
I think Freddy is alive. I stopped at the house that is part of the quest line for finding him and there definitely wasn't a note there. Then 30 minutes later there was. I'm convinced there is a 9 year old kid running around out there just one step ahead of me. /s
---
When i think about the dev team of Fallout 76, i can only imagine one picture.
---
A flooded basement without any working power, a mess of cables that was damaged by the rats, spider webs that block the entrance of the server rooms, and one lonely guy with a torch who tries to find the sense and logic behind all that.
---
Literally the Bethesda in Bethesda :)
---
ouch! my main rig is a ryzen 2600 ($150) and it is more than capable
---
Because if you only need 1 set, a couple hundred caps is better than a couple thousand. With the 1400 caps per day limit at vendors, the plans are 2 or 3 days worth of caps. 
---
I think previous Fallouts set up this expectation that you are some kind of regional god, the Great Decider the whole world revolves around.  The fact that you're totally ordinary in 76 was refreshing to me.  It's kind of like if New Vegas left off with your decision about what to do with the Platinum Chip, rather than assigning you the task of single-handedly deciding who wins the Mojave.
---
Yes happens a lot now, missing an arm usually, sometimes also a leg. Very strange. 
---
This isn‚Äôt fortnite, it‚Äôs not going to have seasons or acts or any of that stuff. This is the game.
---
Must be a newbie software developer.
---
You assume these changes are small, what about balance? They could tweak a stat and then the mob is too easy. 
---
Also you don't know their prioritization. What if they are prioritizing new content and spending 1 day on bugs/tweaks a month?
---
And what about their QA process? Maybe these tweaks are in the codebase ready to go out but need to pass QA before getting release. Changes take time.
---
Watch out there, don't call out the whine-train, you'll get downvoted!
---
Since the game is quite boring, I usually just do nukes all day and stack up ballistic fiber since I‚Äôm constantly in Power Armor. I wouldn‚Äôt want to do Queen in my normal armor considering how much of a task it is to repair armor in general. 
---
We can‚Äôt judge the game on what it could be. With the negative press it‚Äôs entirely possible this is all we‚Äôre getting, story wise. We can‚Äôt hold out for an episode 2 that may never come.
---
This has been a consistent response. The stash is not nearly as dynamic, as opposed to nearly all of the ‚Äúwear and tear‚Äù items I carry on my character: ammo, weapons, armor, food etc. From item counts to condition, these are attributes that need to be sync‚Äôd after every player event (firing, taking damage etc), or that degrade over time, which is far more frequent than accessing my stash or crafting a couple of times during a 1 hr session.
---
Most high level players (175+) Ive encountered are carrying all of their weapons &amp; armor on their character because of the limited stash size. Constantly weighing whether engaging in a public event like SBQ vs losing your junk is somerthing Im sure most players struggle with. My character currently has ~1400 weight with all strength/weight perks applied. I would argue that is far more detrimental to server stability than increasing the stash limit.
---
It‚Äôs the apocalypse. The world has dead people out the wazoo. You can only have them die in so many different ways before it gets boring.
---
Are they more expensive in Camden park? I didn't know you could find the same plans for cheaper at random
---
The point is , not everyone has the 6/7k caps to afford the plans, and them craft a pair of mods to use on his Pw set (Cali shocks costs flux and other rare to come by stuff to craft ) This game has a lot of rng involved , and you have to farm for a lot of things if you want to have the best itens in the game unfortunately. 
---
I don't even know what that means so I'm sure I will survive.
---
&gt;All they did is they switched its model, ramp up its HP and called a day, instead of actually design fight mechanics to big as f#cking monster that needs to be taken down with group. 
---
Well, I've farmed a lot of Baals on Diable 2 and it was both singleplayer and online game. There was no more elaborate gameplay. Go in, smash down anything prior, and then just farm it for essentially meaningless exp and some minor petty rewards. I can't even remember exactly what the rewads were, runes I think. Exit and join another game to do exactly the same thing. Essentially an elaborate cookie clicker game.  I liked playing necromancer as then I didn't have to click on every damn enemy.
---
&gt; SBQ has 0 teamwork needed, because it's a dragon taken from Skyrim, what was single player game. 
---
Well technically they tried actually. But because the codes are fixed, people skip that.
---
Oh and go ahead making a post about how the codes should be server unique and how the nuke silos should be built inside acid so you can't skip them using PA glitch :)
---
That would make it quite require teamplay. And that's reasonable change to implement.
---
Getting?  Most folks have been frustrated. I haven't played in weeks and whenever I'm online the people actually playing the game keeps dropping. 
---
This kinda shit happens to me all the time on PS4. I forget to put on Weapon artisan to repair weapons and if i do, it takes me forever to realize that i didnt reequip White Knight or Marathoner(i have END 2) Same with demo expert and gunsmith. The only thing i never forget is ammo bc its so tedious to farm for it. 
---
Ignorance truly is bliss, my friend. 
---
It's still happening. The game is an utter shit show still. Potentially easy fixes just not getting sorted. I'm salty because a hermit crab smooshed me whilst this was happening.
---
Go to Brad
---
What a fucking fail this game was. And whatever number of devs in the team worked on it and still tinker with it all knew it was a trash fire long before we did. They should‚Äôve shut it down and removed the ability to buy/DL it a while back. At least the mystery and intrigue of this half-baked fallout title would then be an interesting bullet point in Fallout history.  
---
"Oh good! You're awake!"
---
You can buy the plans in Camden. The actual mods show up on the bot in Harpers Ferry. The plans are exorbitantly expensive if you only want one set of mods. 
---
The (possibly) full list of places I've found marine armor plans of some sort:
---
Harper's ferry. The bombed out building nearest the fast travel spawn. Look for the big red shipping container gate, and the building is immediately to the left. There's a spawn on the fist floor and the third in the display cases, not where the recipe spawns.
---
Drop site c2 on the big industrial shelves.
---
Drop site g3 on the big industrial shelves.
---
The train car on the track west of Watoga station. On the small stack of wood crates. Part of the plan can clip into the crates, so only ¬º of the plan is visible
---
They were never purchased and never meant to work on mobile games. BGS Austin was started by Zenimax (Bethesda's parent company) to make Battle Cry. Battle Cry was set to be a multiplayer and free to play game with microtransactions. The studio is specialized in multiplayer games. After Battle Cry got cancelled they helped other Zenimax studios and added multiplayer to Doom and now Fallout. 
---
Dude why are y‚Äôall still playing this game? 
---
Oh now I follow, you buy the plans in camden but you can get the mods themselves in Harper's Ferry, got it
---
I am a very new player(lv6) and know that bethesda made an anti griefer system where you have to both attack each other for pvp to really start. But I was at the overseer‚Äôs camp recently and a lvl50 with a bounty started shooting at me and I just ignored it, but he kept shooting and my health deteriorated down to halfway from just him shooting. I eventually changed servers bc i was kind of annoyed, but did he just have a super powerful weapon that allowed him to deal that much dmg even though i hadn‚Äôt attacked him yet? and can a player kill another player without them attacking back?
---
&gt;	We call it "end game."
---
Just a few years younger than you, and that isn‚Äôt as reassuring as it sounds -_-
---
Bye

Negative rubber duck. 
---
Tbh i never had a queen that didnt drop a legendary **but** i never ever got anything useful. Instigating flamers, stalker melees, the most stupid shit. Her loot pool needs a total revamp its ridicilous. And put her loot as reward so everybody gets the loot. 
---
Well I understand it's when people hit the little down arrow but as for what that means I honestly don't really care. lol. 
---
I just like stating my opinion.
---
Both ballistic fiber and screws are so easy to find
---
I have similar experiences. Different situations will put different stresses on the CPU/GPU/RAM: more objects to draw - GPU, more enemies moving around - CPU. There are a bunch of bots in the bunker... so maybe that is it (I know that the cpu usage is low, but because it is having to track so many things it just has more to do and has to access more memory ect, so that even though it may not be actually crunch anything it cannot draw the next frame until it knows where everything is)... this is my understanding, but idk
---
Fallout 76: A forced delusion. 
---
It‚Äôs like everyone is still hoping this will recover like No Mans Sky and they refuse to believe how terrible this game is and how bad Bethesda is alienating even their most loyal fan boys.
---
Fun fact: yesterday was a day of rememberence for NASA because Columbia, Challenger and the Apollo accident all happened this week. 
---
Just something I thought of reading your NMS/rocket analogy.
---
My problem with the timed sales is more reverse psychology than anything else.  It's the Steam sale philosophy.  If anything can potentially go on sale, and I don't care if I have it *right now*, why shouldn't I just wait until it goes on sale?  Nothing in their store is so "Gotta have it" that it can't wait.  It's all "That might be nice to have."
---
All the "Messenger" Events revolve around helping a robot mailman to reach into destroyed houses with dead

---
Starting PvP is actually quite funky in this game and it‚Äôs more ‚Äúgrey area‚Äù than ‚ÄúI shoot them they shoot me‚Äù if you had a bounty, or were in a team with somebody that already aggro‚Äôd this person then they would be doing full damage.
---
 The fact that they just chipped away at your health instead of finishing you quick tells me that you weren‚Äôt enemies with him, he may have just been shooting you long enough to deal that much damage even with the slap damage filter, if he was doing full damage you would‚Äôve died, trust me.
---
It doesn't make sense to give us half-floors but no walls to match. At best, it's an oversight. They should correct it.
---
Let's hope we get some in the next content expansion.
---
Why is everyone practicing their break up speeches on Bethesda? 
---
Just four weapons at least.   One melee one postal one long gun and one big gun(Gatling nuke etc)
---
It‚Äôs just Todd Howard in a room with a Monkey‚Äôs Paw.
---
I dunno about ballistic fiber, but you could definitely get screws and shit from guns.
---
0 fucks given. 
---
Seriously. There‚Äôs like 3 a day now. 
---
I have the evidence of my own eyes: I have learned, by scrapping, weapons and armor modifications which are also available in plans.
---
All those questions are for you to roleplay, not for Bethesda to answer for you.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_\/¬Ø 
---
The main story is about finding a way to kill the scorched to save everyone. Everyone as in the players.
---
I feel the lack of NPC‚Äôs really add to the atmosphere of the game and that sense of loneliness and emptiness is incredibly effective at reinforcing the belief that Appalachia was once a thriving community even after the bombs had dropped. The idea that the scorched plague wiped out the populace was brilliant and we who lived in the vaults were untouched. Understanding the Overseer‚Äôs role in Appalachia was very intriguing as well, following her and listening to her story alongside your own was flawless in its execution and I found the way the stories were delivered and presented to us was great compared to NPC interaction, it was different. 
---
If you‚Äôre talking *actual* armor I like Combat Armor, it provides decent energy and ballistic damage.
---
If you‚Äôre talking *legendary* armor, the meta right now is Sentinel Assassin (More damage to players, less damage taken while standing still) or Unyielding (my personal favorite (+3 to all SPECIAL stars when low health) )
---
Log out normally then back in check the progress.  Go see the Sgt Gutsy and see if it will let you complete.  
---
It‚Äôs been an odd bug for awhile.
---
I have also played most of the content in the game, though not everything as I intentionally leave myself things to do. I've bought Skyrim 5 times now and haven't completed the main story once. Yeah I know I'm weird. This game is really great I love it so much. The developers did an amazing job with almost every aspect of it. But some things just ruin it for me. From launch onwards there were a lot of disconnects and crashes. And accessing your stash and inventory lagged the game. I think they have improved those things a lot since then. Still there is no rejoin previous server. This is one of the most damning things I think, because that is what is going to make most people rage quit, after spending an hour or more working on something to lose it to some crash or disconnect. 
---
Also to me it seems like they don't know what they are doing with the atomic shop. I have spent a lot on games microtransactions. Some games I just won't spend a penny. Some companies I won't give a penny. But I would have spent money on this game, even in the poor stability and buggy state it was and still is, if they had provided stuff I wanted in the atom shop. So to me, they screwed up big time with that also. Raider stuff not preppy shit.
---
I think the game is great and I reject a lot of the criticism of it to do with human NPCs and story, even though I have poked at them with that criticism myself when stressed or annoyed. I don't really care about the TSE nerf. White Knight nerf doesn't bother me. Demo expert nerf doesn't really bother me. But I know these things do bother a lot of people. Feed the People didn't need fixed. Cap stashes are a mess now and if they want to fix them right then the respawn timer should be a few hours max.
---
This is my feedback and I'm just going to leave it here because I also love the game and I have had great experiences with it and enjoyed every minute of it when not getting disconnected or crashing or freezing or mobs being underground at workshops, or whatever. The game is great and I would say everyone should give it a chance and get as much enjoyment out of it as I have. If they could fix the stuff I mentioned here I think a lot of people could play happily for a long time.
---
Its because big bad Bethesda wont update there game everyday for an entire year to apease the masses 
---
I wouldn't worry about the negative press.
---
BGS hasalready committed to future DLCs and the updates begin to happen around the time the PvP mode drops. 
---
I look forward to rigging an election to become President.
---
All that aside if the monorail time machine doesn't factor into future PVE content drops I will be pissed off. I mean you don't dangle that and not make use of it.
---
Bye Felicia

I enjoy the PvP. Just wish more would participate. Can‚Äôt wait for the PvP servers. 
---
Waaaaaaay too emotionally involved in a video game..

Lost my Excavator PA Left Leg that way. Why it was first on the list of things to transfer I don't know.

Spot on with the gta griefing. Gta's griefing makes FO76 look like candyland.

I will have to go looking. Thanks for the heads up.
---
This is not an airplane, there is no need to announce your departure
---
Yea i like the idea that everyone gets a loot. Cant count the number of times I didnt even get to check because her body disappeared or it takes forever to load and the body disappeared with the meat pile nowhere to be found. Only problem are the leechers now. They'd just stick around to get a prize. The developers have to come up with something to counter that I guess
---
I wan't trying to insult, just liked how the phrase fit :P
---
A fetch quest to rig votes and three Vault raids does not a story extension make.
---
Also, Andromeda committed to future DLC too. We all know how that went.
---
Known issue, and has been reported here on Reddit several times (just do a search), and also there has been at least one ticket filed about it. See: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aobkwm/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_weapons/
---
Can't tell if a troll or just have a very low expectation of quality. But everything you said I disagree with. Nothing was interesting about following some dumb overseer's logs. That's not a real quest line. That's lazyness. 
---
Good fuck off
---
I know.. I wasn't trying to come off defensive either. :)
---
I‚Äôll be playing fallout 76 for hours after workü§£üòÅ
---
Pve only. Not in to pvp yet.  Still low level.  And yes legendary perks but again, the type is important.   Is it worth it to carry more than one set?  Robot, ghoul, scorched type sets.  For the instance you are doing? And the mods you put on.  Also.  I die alot with unyielding,  is there a trick to running that setup?
---
Have some patience. It is better that they spend time fixing it, than to hurry up for the sake of hurrying up. Why be in such a hurry?
---
Anyone else feel like bsd expected us to create our own factions, fighting (raiders very everybody) and bickering (FS v Bos) between the groups, just like the dead we're "helping"? And that's why they are seemingly shoving pvp down our throats? Kind of like the are trying to force the outcome they wanted since most people seem more interested in cooperative gaming than killing everyone they meet. Since they can't turn us into to scorched or super mutants...
---
Thanks bro üëçüèª I searched but the app gave me a bunch of random topics for some reason. Good to know I‚Äôm not the only one frustrated by this. 
---
Bethesda have 0 idea how to balance a fallout game. They always have had incredibly many ways to break their games and a ton of way to deal way more damage than you should be able to.
---
They are completely new to this and instead of asking for help by some more experienced developers they screw up everything they could.
---
I‚Äôve seen it too. Probably a misplaced bit of lens flare graphics. 
---
Because this company deserves the backlash, we‚Äôre all angry at this shit game and how Bethesda falsely advertised everything about it. This sub doesn‚Äôt deserve an ounce of delusion that this game is good. Especially the fact that there are Bethesda PR shill accounts posting in this sub making the game seem like it‚Äôs something it really isn‚Äôt 
---
Yeah it has nothing to do with them only being capable of fixing one attack on one monster after a two week period.
---
LUL this game can be 10 years old and in the same state it's in now and people will still whiteknight Bethesda. It's so clear the people that whiteknight this game generally play 10x less than the people criticisizing it so it'll improve.
---
But fuck it. This corporation is the corporation you love, so you stop that reddit teenager who saved up 60$ to buy this terrible excuse for a "Bethesda" game from bullying the poor little defenseless megacorp. 
---
I remember how bad Resident Evil 6 was, and how many fans hated Capcom for that, how they trashed one of the best Survival Horror games, by moving too far away from the original concept.
---
But after the bad sells, they returned with a stronger game, that was closer to the originals with 7 and made one of the best remakes ever made with the recent RE2.
---
Companies are lead by humans, humans can make mistakes and learn from it, and be smarter and better next time.
---
I dont think Fallout 76 would make a comeback, but Bethesda have good IPs and still many talented devs, they just need to focus more what they can best, single player.
---
Well said, whenever I disconnect I just rejoin a server, usually through friends but if I‚Äôm playing solo (or we all disconnect) that still really irks me.
---
Regarding the Atomic Shop, I haven‚Äôt spent ANY money on it but still have most things I want. This is because Bethesda loads me up with atoms for leveling up, completing quests, etc. I have more atoms than I know what to do with ( my personal theory (and one I hope NEVER happens) is that they‚Äôll try to tie mods in to atoms, so I‚Äôm saving them up just in case)
---
I like how you touched on the NPC thing, the game *has* NPC‚Äôs. The game *does not have* human NPC‚Äôs. Most of the roles are still filled and fairly well, realistically the only things missing are the dialogue system
---
On to the nerfs, I‚Äôm in mostly the same boat as you, but I personally think they should take the ‚Äúbuff other things‚Äù route instead of the ‚Äúnerf the good things‚Äù one they‚Äôve been taking. That being said, Bethesda CANNOT have the cesspool of a PvP system that they had on launch, everyone was getting one shot and it ruined the fights. For the most part that‚Äôs ‚Äúfixed-ish‚Äù now.
---
Thank you for your thoughts!
---
&gt; You‚Äôve paid for it probably by now. Stop comparing the price you paid to others. 
---
Perhaps. But a person can be genuinely very dissatisfied with Fallout 76.
---
&gt;someone else paid less for it somewhere else. Don‚Äôt let it beat you up.
---
So in theory when you see someone stealing from the said grocery store, you don't go waaah?
---
Swear to god I knew what the picture was before I clicked it. 
---
They are trying to play on people's FOMO with timed sales. But Riomaki makes a good point in that they dont bother to give even the slightest discount. That fear of not buying it on sale over weighs the fear of missing out entirely. Atleast for me. And even then these "sales" are a complete joke. 
---
They don't realize the true pricing model of 3-10 is the better pricing range than 6-20. I can't fathom dropping $18 for a repainted power armor AT ALL. Heck I won't bother spending my atom points on anything until they fix this pricing model, I don't care what I miss out on. I'm going to stick to my virtual wallet and just boycott this junk until they change it or I quit and never spend it anways.
---
Add TheMesierVader
---
This was all very well reasoned and written and I liked it, except the part about immediate satisfaction. It should have been held till it was functional, that‚Äôs not really negotiable imho, huge, glaring screw up. 
---
That sort of standard is missing from lots of titles but the standard hasn‚Äôt moved, early access and ‚Äúbetas‚Äù have made what we got less of an immediate project killer.
---
I dont think youll find any static spawns of legendary weapons.
---
Generals steakhouse either has a minigun or the dragon on a table upstairs in the main dining hall.
---
Sons of dane one violent night *usually* rewards the unique bloodied sacrificial blade called the nailer.
---
You can find an alien blaster near the crashed space station, I believe its further east, in the rubble of a house with an open safe (theres a key in the safe or in the water beside it, for freddy fears)
---
Minigun behind a 3* lockpick door in camp venture. 
---
They did this TES Legends, too. Dragged their feet. That game is alive now due to the sheer tenacity of its few remaining players refusing to let Zenimax kill it. And it's still woefully behind in content.
---
Iguana bob strikes again.
---
why can we not have a timer like the daily challenges?  I COULD CODE IT!!  lmfao
---
I like it dont get me wrong theres issues but ill gladly play till new stuff is out i love fallout games and there other stuff but people who shit on this one game have there own problems since we all know fallout has issues and people were chill with those issues and now since the game is online it's all of a sudden the end of the gaming industry like the release of E.T. years ago
---
So it's not just me. Cant stand PA and would hate to see the late game require it.
---
I live in NOVA, want me to go knock on Bethesda's door and ask what's up?
---
Battlecry really needs to get their shit together. I took a break from the game after playing for the first week or two. There's still NOTHING to do. Where's the goddamn content? I thought live service and microtransactions meant we'd be getting sizable updates bi-monthly? That's generally how this works. I'd be fine with it if the game was stable and less buggy now, but it really isn't that much of improvement. Still a shit ton of broken events and dailies, still crashes and server crashes, I still lose items randomly at times.
---
Rip that large deathclaw gauntlet that did 230dmg per hit.
---
I was a bit pissed they failed on the RPG and story front, but they did just as bad at the action, survival, and MMO-lite elements.
---
I'm hoping they're just planning a huge update/overhaul and that's why we haven't seen much.
---
We need a roadmap. 
---
And flux 
---
But..it's purified......
---
This is exactly what Bethesda just asked everyone..... 
---
You keep the extra charge in the core. The Gatling Laser's magazine only "sees" the first 100% of the core charge, so when you eject the "empty" core you'll have one with 20% charge left in your inventory.
---
In all seriousness, a top-tier developer is asking their audience who already bought the game "how can we make this game fun?" sounds a lot like "how can I make a fun game people want to buy?"  
---
These are questions that should have been figured out internally prior to launch.  Ongoing tweaks should be made for any long-term game, but this is a bit to he extreme.
---
3 months in isn't a hurry for ANY new content when it comes to live services. Despite that, we haven't even seen a roadmap yet. 
---
I die a lot with Unyielding as well but I think it‚Äôs a problem with the enemies (almost all of them are ‚Äúrun up I your face and hit you‚Äù instead of ‚Äútake cover and shoot you‚Äù baddies)
---
If you‚Äôre talking about having more than one set of ‚ÄúX Slayers‚Äù armor, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it because of stash space but if you can manage it that may be the way to go!!
---
The real truck with Unyielding is to sort of pick your fights, I can take *ANYTHING* on in a 1v1, but even feral ghouls give me trouble in a 10v1
---
Regarding mods, for the material of your armor (top slot) id go for whichever one produces the best bonus numerically, for the misc (second slot) take whatever you feel you need, examples being ultra light build or dense, if you‚Äôre low on carry weight or dying to explosives respectively
---
I'll check it out thanks :)
---
Easy caps! I do it every time I can. 
---
The Bus Hermit Crabs. They are funny and surprising when you first come across them.
---
I don‚Äôt care Mole Rats. They are annoying with the digging and popping up.
---
The best encounters are surprise encounters or encounters with multiple types of enemies. It is interesting when a Super Mutant patrol gets hit by a Scorchbeast. 
---
I would like to see Raiders added. I like sniping raiders in the face.
---
I just like seeing ammo drop as loot. As kong as there is at least ammo I am happy. 
---
I would like to see harder multiplayer encounters. Mainly because they cannot be soloed and encourage teamwork.
---
Man I must be missing something. I have a two shot hunting rifle with the same 10%+ while aiming - with maxed out rifleman it only does 191 damage. 
---
Picked up marine arms finally in that boxcar a couple days ago myself. A fair number of plans spawn in various locations around the Mire, I make a loop looking for legendaries and plans, usually get at least one new-to-me plan per trip.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just Myron in the basement now. 
---
I should just copy and paste what this guy said
---
Had that too. I‚Äôve read it could be an enemy model that just didn‚Äôt load.
---
Either or, there were canonically kids born in the Vault so it‚Äôs really just up to your own interpretation of your character.
---
Nothing goes over your head, you're too fast, you'd catch it.  Just like Drax.
---
I hope that your hopes get real, but i would not count on that.
---
I think Bethesda giving up on Fallout 76, moving away silently to avoid any backlash.
---
You are not an airplane, there is no reason to announce your departure.
---
I came across two wetsuit plans in the Mire on the same day. Make a circuit of locations in the Mire - the boxcar mentioned above is great, as are several of the firebases, sometimes the antique store (also look for Brotherhood Fatigues here) and its shed, sometimes some of the ruined buildings that don't actually show as significant locations on the map.
---
What more do you want them to do in terms of communication?
---
There‚Äôs literally employees of Bethesda replying to threads on this very subreddit and on their forums daily , they ask for community feedback and what the community want to see in the future of their game in their inside the vaults.
---
They actively fix glitches and patch certain things which have been reported to them in the Glitch megathread.
---
They actively respond to people tweeting them on twitter.
---
What other major game company do you see doing that on a consistent basis.
---
This + better anti spam filters than WoW. 
---
head to a train station 
---
Exactly.
---
There's a glowing meat pile mod on nexusmods.
---
I identify as an airplane. Don't transport shame me.
---
This old post made me cry a little :'((
---
That doesn‚Äôt even make any sense. The worst retort ever. I‚Äôm sure all those ‚ÄúGame of the Year‚Äù awards are in the post then. IGN ‚Äì 5/10, Attack of the Fanboy ‚Äì 2.5/5, The Guardian ‚Äì 2/5, GameSpot ‚Äì 4/10, USgamer‚Äì 2/5, I could go on and on. Denial is an awful thing...
---
Oh yeah, 100% should have been held off until it was more functional. Huge fuck up there, but the matter was around story and even if it were functional? Story would still be lacking substance, since they planned to release more in the form of content updates from the start.
---
The immediate satisfaction thing, was mostly targeted at the content updates in the end though. Not at the state of the game itself. But here's hoping they don't rush the content updates before the game is truly functional enough to call itself a launched title.
---
As for the betas and early access thing.. Yeah.. :/ I can say, at first? The Early Access thing wasn't that bad, though. Like 7DaysToDie, it functioned just fine for the most part. Far better than 76 has been, even. The idea behind that went down hill fast though, and yeah. Early Access likely did bring down the bar of what is an acceptable launch day level in this case. Lol.
---
"take your time and do it right, HURRY UP, DAILY UPDATES YOU MFERS" 
---
The only mistake about TSE it was so obscenely powerful at start. That's always bad as then the evitable nerf is going to feel bad to so many.
---
I brought my first one few days ago. Still need to farm lots of adrehesive and steel to fully mod it. If they would have mostly left TS and explosives alone and just nerfed the combination, some mechanics and particularly shotgun explosvies, I probably would be still happy with my looted "inferior" guns and to play and wait for genuine TSE drop.
---
&gt;Also you don't know their prioritization. What if they are prioritizing new content and spending 1 day on bugs/tweaks a month?
---
They could tell us that in their silly monthly newsletter... But they haven't said anything of the sort because they would probably be liable for a lawsuit for lying if they promised something they are obviously not working on. They tell us nothing at all so it's not our fault we have no idea wtf they're doing. 
---
SBQ support type camp.
---
&gt; You're killing it to end the source of all the other scorchbeasts.
---
For who? Everyone is dead. Does Fallout 76 address the folloowing question: 'If I wasn't here would it matter?'
---
I also disagree with this notion of 'patience'. The game should be three DLCs deep before the story comes alive. Fallout 76 has no emotional hook for the character. You aren't chasing your dad. You aren't saving your loved ones. You aren't slogging through for the betterment of humanity because everything presented within the game suggests humanity is gone. It's the difference between:
---
* Quest: Save the children from the burning orphanage.
---
* Quest: Put out the orphanage fire, don't mind the charred corpses.
---
They're usually in wide open spaces surrounded by their mammoths. 
---
Possibly with some turrets though too, as a firebase.
---
That‚Äôs even stupider than the last thing you tried to pull off as facts.
---
Just...go away. You‚Äôre boring and stupid.
---
You know, all these comments complaining about complaining about complaining posts are getting old.
---
I loved the game but refusal from Bethesda to actually do something about bad things is what made me despise FO76
---
Server disconnects are really frustrating! Hope that you get some rest and feel better!
---
Is there anything in that tunnel??
---
Thanks.
---
Nukes are the only late game we have and they require it 
---
Now imagine I'm a developer and I read this as feedback:
---
* dont get me wrong theres issues but ill gladly play till new stuff is out
---
Cool. This person will play without me having to do anything. Enjoy your zero-update sandbox.
---
I just do not understand the point of this.
---
Thanks! Let me check that. Also, seems I'm losing a core everytime I logout? Had 17 yesterday before logging off. Login today - says 16... Game crashed, login again and I'm at 15... 
---
Make her loot only available to players with certain amounts of hit and make that number high. Then calculate in bullet weight so snipers will also reach their required shots. Then make the queen only get higher ressistance when players hit her and not when they come near her. Now only players hitting her make her stronger and if they want loot they actually have to contribute to the fight. And instead of her getting higher ressistance, split that between more health and more ressistance. 
---
See the problem with this kind of thing isn‚Äôt the price: It doesn‚Äôt matter that it‚Äôs 20 bucks. What matters is that 1) I never got the choice in the first place because I wasn‚Äôt logged in when BB paint was available. 2) I wouldn‚Äôt want to incentivize Bethesda to add more cosmetics to the ATOM store instead of fixing core functionality. 
---
So? 
---
Nice venture brother's reference you got there for a name. The last season ending with Hank walking away from it all to start his new life as " The Bat" was so perfect, had me dying.
---
35$? In germany you get the game for free from some stores when you buy an used PS4 Controller for 20‚Ç¨ lol.
---
Completely agree
---
One thing to keep in mind with "x" slayer armor is that it's a straight damage reduction as opposed to improved damage resistance, which can be truly powerful when stacked with things like sentinel's legendary perks. I have a few zealot's sentinel pieces that I run and I actually take more damage in power armor against the queen than I do without.
---
Non-legendary, the best straight up armor is going to the the heavy combat armor with the BOS mods. With max level gear, you can run a damage resistance only slightly less than power armor (not counting the rad resistance) and if you have either Vanguard's or Bolstering (high vs. Low hp builds), your resistances can actually beat power armor. Add the grounded mutation if you aren't using energy weapons and your energy resistance increases even further
---
Here's mine, since we're sharing.
---

---
I feel like youre missing the big picture i will play other games and i will play this game even if there is no big update for a while they know people want content they wont just read this one post and go god dman this man is our man he is the guy we need he'll keep playing no thats not how devs look at this shit 
---
Yes but I don't think we've seen a big sale or anything. Maybe once there are like a hundred or two items. 
---
Marine? I dont think so. It only stands out because of the rad resistance. But its worse in terms of ballistic/energy res than leather and metal ones which supposed to be the weakest. It dont makes sense. I'm talking bout limbs tho, dont know about the chest.
---
Up in the northeast corner of the map is a little gem called Feddy''s house of scares. That place generally spawns a wending which drop those wonderful screws. U can also hit wending cave.
---
There is NO reason to include world chat. But why would a single player game with no NPCs need that? Makes no sense. Best nerf that idea by 50%. Single chat, you can only talk to yourself. /sarcasm
---
If you're still playing this game post launch week, it's because you enjoy pain and suffering. 
---
5 times in one hour ya say!? Thos are rookie numbers, WE GOT TO PUMP THOSE NUMBERS UP!
---
Plans sometimes spawn at the top of Grafton Steel, climb to the highest point by the entrance. That‚Äôs somewhat cheaper ;)
---
Those ARE facts captain denial lol. You sad and deluded. I literally hopped on google and typed ‚ÄúFallout76 Reviews‚Äù and a whole list of REAL review scores appeared. 
---
https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fallout-76.
---
Yea I've missed out on a few things literally just because I had to work. It's annoying. I already play constantly
---
Granted, but everything he does doesn't work. 
---
Clearly you haven't read anything in the replies made to you. The answer to that question has been covered at least 3 times now. 
---
For the sake of humanity as a whole. For the sake of those in the vaults who will one day emerge (we know they won't, but the dweller does not). 
---
For the sake of the potential survivors in other regions. Hope for humanity, the entire theme of this story discussion. 
---
The entire theme of the story itself. 
---
I'm over this debate now, though. You obviously have no intention of actually absorbing any information that you feel doesn't agree with your idea on this debate.
---
Quite honestly, it is going in circles. So to any reply you might have to this? Or any other story or lore based matter? Simply reread what has already been posted, all your answers are in there. Either from me, or Emu.
---
&gt; i will play this game even if there is no big update for a while
---
Ok, so enjoy not having big updates.
---
&gt;they wont just read this one post and go god dman this man is our man he is the guy we need he'll keep playing no thats not how devs look at this shit
---
They will if enough people say it. You want a game that has no updates? Best way to do it is to head to the feedback forums and say 'I will play this game the way it is for &lt;undefined length of time&gt;'. And that is exactly what you are saying.
---
You had to take multiple points in scrapper to get anything other than steel and wood it really isn't that different.
---
I appreciate this so much. I can't even to being to describe how literal I was about the desk fans mate.
---
I could be wrong but u believe there is a cryprid that drops ballistic fiber. Fog crawler I think? The big preying mantis guys
---
Seen one attack Whitesprings recently. Also had to kill one before i could take Bog Town workshop.
---
Lol, &lt;insert Captain Picard facepalm pic&gt;
---
Do I have to provide screenshots showing that leather limb has more ballistic res than the marine limb?
---
I‚Äôve seen a glowing behemoth once at a nuked whitesprings
---
That's what's up! 
---
"Yes, yes. You're THE BAT! And THE BAT is the reason why we didn't take Best Group Costume... again! Last year, it was Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, and THE BAT! Oh, and how about the time we were the hard-rocking quartet of Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Ace Frehley, and THE BAT?"
---
"The night is mine." 
---
Comedy Gold.
---
What type of audience do you think will have more fun out of this game? I know pvp'ers will only have their pvp servers in march but do you think this game was built to serve a more fun experience for a smaller community that seek pvp action rather then a bigger community who only want a story and pve?
---
What ranged weapon is the best stats? I was / remain a TSE Lever Action because it still out-damages everything else I have. I mostly PVE, so it‚Äôs still my go to against hard enemies. I found an Instigating hunting that is effective and can one shot most enemies, but not sure it‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù I run low-ish health and have adrenal reaction. When people say ‚ÄúTSE is trash now‚Äù what am I missing? I know it‚Äôs effectiveness is reduced, but what is better. I‚Äôve heard people say AAE is underwhelming. I refuse to go Melee... so it‚Äôs rifles or nothing. 
---
You are an idiot. Your mindset is exactly why this game will never fixed. 
---
Especially when it's clear they're sitting in dozens of items. We get new stuff constantly. Charging that much also make me wait a week to see if anything is better. 
---
I'd be much more likely to impulse buy something for a dollar than five. Like those fucking hats. They all should be 250 max 
---
The difference is that in 76, no amount of points in scrapper get you screws or springs or gears.
---
No, PA is very durable. I've had mine for 25 levels and only repaired it now because I got the 200% repair perk. 
---
Once repaired you cannot do anything to it (I don't think there are any mods) and that is why it disappears, I think.
---
&gt; For the sake of humanity as a whole. For the sake of those in the vaults who will one day emerge (we know they won't, but the dweller does not).
---
Humanity that is (for all presented evidence to the vault dweller) already dead?
---
&gt;For the sake of the potential survivors in other regions.
---
Based on what?
---
Your story hinges on 'The character must believe other people are alive somewhere even though every single encounter is with a corpse'. Why? It is completely circular. The story requires you to believe it so your character believes it because it makes the story work. What *reason* do they have to believe it? Blind faith? Is every player character doomed to be a hopeless idealist bordering on religious conviction that someone else is alive?
---
I kind of disagree, I mean it's not a fantastic story mostly in how shallow it is right now and how quickly you can run through it. But on my first play-through, at least until I was lvl 40-ish it really worked well with the lonely feeling the game kind of gives. In a way it dangles this bit of hope that you are following a signal that could lead you to some sort of bastion of humanity only to find that the world is actually as desolate, destroyed and lonely as when you walked out of the vault. 
---
In terms of the quest I wouldn't read in to the small events too much in terms of story line. They're there so you can "farm" something and have something else to do other than schlep through the wasteland. I thought the side quests were pretty interesting the women of mystery, finding Freddy  (yeah I'm getting all the actual names wrong) they do kind of add to the fact that other stuff was going on in the world and all of those interesting things either started or ended with the bombs falling.
---
That being said: my second character I just focused on what I need an the world felt much less alive (or dead/desolate) and dangerous as my first character up to a certain point. That's where I think the shallowness of the story really starts to hit the game imho. It's taking far too long for there to be a follow up: new vaults opening, BoS flying in and starting to establish a new foothold or \*whatever\*. There's tons of factions that could be interesting to expand on (Sons of Dane for example), so there's potential from those silly side quests and events.
---
Dumbkoff. You started this by saying people posting that their friends list are dark is all the evidence you need.
---
They don‚Äôt even post screenshots, and you‚Äôre all quick to call that evidence and facts.
---
Why? Because you are so ducked up twisted with rage hate over a game. Over a video game.
---
There‚Äôs a fact for you. And it‚Äôs also evidence your stupid.
---
I want content but ill keep playing its not hard to understand and sure call me an idiot for playing a game and accepting the shit show that has happened so far it wasn't perfect and won't be for a while 
---
I also don't play with PA. I dunno if it's just my horde of junk I sit upon or the "fix it good" perks but I never have any issues repairing my armor. I also somehow have a fat stack of ballistic fiber. I think I got it from cryptids
---
I‚Äôve got Ultracite I‚Äôm scared to wear and get broken, won‚Äôt be able to afford to fix. I wear excavator everywhere because 100lbs increase to haul junk back to camp and scrap. 
---
I walk around in the woods collecting junk, to scrap. For me the game is Homeless Can-Man simulator, where weight management is the most exciting part. 
---
Holy shit! You can actually find something useful with them
---
That should be a sign that the game is loosing more players than it‚Äôs attracting. Of course people are posting. They are pissed they got jipped. 
---
You really can creat some truly broken builds in this game using armor
---
Why don‚Äôt you post or copy/paste whatever you are talking about. 
---
That part is true, without question.  
---
With the FO4 engine, what this is based on, a similar set up results in cap on the total items displayed, with the "use all" flags
---
Yeah, fixing Fallout 76 would eat tons of budget (bugs, stability, servers, balance, new content, marketing) and they know that.
---
So they try to sell the last of it, get as much money as possible with the Atomic Shop and close the doors to save future costs.
---
If you think shills are easy to spot you must've taken off your special glasses because there are corporate shills from companies like Rockstar EA etc. That have been here since launch
---
That could have been lessened by not making all three of them identical layouts.
---
I get that. I was referring to the idea suggested about adding them to 76. Its basically how it was done in 4.
---
When I spent an entire session fighting Supermutants,
---
Scorch beasts and deathclaws my left leg should not be getting hit x10 more often.   
---
Ghouls and mole rats, sure,'legs would get a beating
---
Where do you go to have your finishing officiated?
---
You crash that often?!?
---
Honestly, I use T60 armor and have it fully modded. Takes literally nothing to repair it and I have the legs calibrated which increases weight capacity. I wish Power Armor wasn‚Äôt needed for nukes because I love my armor and worked hard in obtaining it however I haven‚Äôt used it much since I obtained it because there‚Äôs literally no content to utilize it right now. 
---
Go up the stairs to the command room and snipe at it through the window.
---
Don‚Äôt let the idiots discourage you. The game has lost most of its fans and the only people hanging on and defending this flaming pile of shit are the idiots in denial and the simple minds who are easily amused. 
---
Yep, excellent point. At least with everything with the Enclave you could pretend they send you a cargo bot.
---
Bethesda's more or less admitted they can't track the items duper, and the identical ID theory is flawed, when an item is duplicated it gets assigned a new, unique ID 
---
Adding real NPCs = Animating, doing lip sync creating small cities that look alive.
---
Not having NPCs and using some dumb excuse for that = a lot less work for bethesda; Now they're paying for it; as they should.
---
Are you excited for foldable phones?
---
Do you like pineapple on pizza?
---
It is faction based, but as of right now even with 30+ server hops it's hard to conclude for sure.
---
Everyday is Grafton day :)
---
Dude this is 2019 you gotta understand meme warfare is a thing. Corporations hire people and buy Reddit and other sites accounts for this stuff. Read this when you get a sec: just 1 example https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html?_r=1
---
Just had the same thing happen a few hours ago, there was only 3 of us me being the lowest level 112 the other 2 were over level 250+, all i got was the some junk and 5 stimpaks. Thats after using up 1k of 556 and 500 2mm ec. And 4 broken guns that cost way too much material farming to fix. Out of frustration i decided to look for some other legendaries to farm and sure enough i found me a 3 star legendary fog crawler after beating it with its buddies with my all rise almost broken all i got was some fog crawler meat and an empty nuka cola bottle. That is when i asked myself why am i even bothering with this game of chores? Logged off and played FO4 im done being Bethesda's chore boy. 
---
I‚Äôve read probably 50 mags and still no trophy. I gave up after reading 17 last night. Screw this game...
---
Fallout 76 have tons of potential, but to fix it you need to invest as much like for a new game.
---
Without considering reloading.
---
Are we saying that each ‚Äúcrank‚Äù of the handle is similar to the animation of a bolt action pin being pulled back?

Sorry you ran into this one it sucks.

Reported as an exploit earlier this week, when a  Lvl 313 tool ran around using the exploit to repeatedly flag and alt of mine using it so his teammates could try and murder it.

Ella Ames wasn‚Äôt even rotten yet if I hadn‚Äôt screwed around changing my nose shape in 76 I coulda got to her in time.

This makes the most sense out of all of these comments haha

Each power plant has a map in the control room.

Have to agree there, I did get a chuckle when a Lvl 313 hit my Lvl 34 alt and one shot himself

Hey man psst. Sugar grove. And if you need spings....yea man, check the shelves at the bottom of the computer room. Thank me later.

And even the holotape bug ruined the impact the first month, lol
---
I think PvP was something that wasn‚Äôt quite *intended* but nevertheless a side effect of multiplayer games, in a perfect world everybody would be teamed up not shooting at each other.
---
I have fun (this sounds like a cop-out but it isn‚Äôt) with my friends, we take pride in our accomplishments and laugh at our glitches. The game caters to somebody that is cool with slow progression and honestly hard choices. ‚ÄúShould I make a New right arm or repair my chest piece, I only have 8 ballistic fiber‚Äù then when you farm enough to do both you feel really good about yourself
---
My camp is another area of progression I‚Äôm looking forward to finishing. I always enjoy finding new plans and where to place them. 
---
Otherwise if you liked Fallout 4 you‚Äôll like this game.
---
There is also a disconnect between the player characters. I mean we supposedly have lived together for years in the vault and yet we all have separate C.A.M.P.S. ? It seems like in reality we would form group settlements and there would be no P.V.P. without strict consequences. 
---
Plus everytime I die its literaly a 5 minute loading screen on a ps4 pro, ammo is impossible to find and I cant pause, and I have to worry about food and water besides my health. Literaly antifun and I die in half the bullets my enemies do
---
Are we talking about the same Supermutants that I know that have terrible aim yet have an innate need to shoot at you from looooooong range? No way they are hitting center mass. 
---
You missed the point and it‚Äôs hilarious.

I‚Äôm getting sick of this damn land line and I don‚Äôt eat pizza only car batteries

You've never watched The Mist have you? Or I am Legend, or any of the other multitudes of movies that involve characters HAVING to hope there is life elsewhere, because they can't live without it.

It would probably slow them down to have multiple people working on such a small feature at once. Not to mention they wouldn't instantly release an update for something that small.

Pretty sure its linked to the other guns you are carrying. You have another weapon with a 36 round mag? Because you should start carrying a minigun &gt;:D
---
God it‚Äôs desperately sad how much you are in denial. Not even making much sense there are ya. Metacritic is a hub that collects all critic and user reviews. 52 average from critics and a user score of 2.6. That‚Äôs desperate by any standards. All your doing is putting your fingers in your ears and making noise to actual problems. That‚Äôs pathetic really. Oh and if it‚Äôs just a video game why are you so butt hurt you need to reply. F76 was a scam and it sets a horrible precedent for the gaming industry as a whole. You help to propagate that which is the saddest thing about you. Utterly delusional.
---
Since the latest patch, every time I join a team my quest markers disappear forcing me to deactivate the quests and follow my team mates markers to find out where I‚Äôm going. Leaving the team doesn‚Äôt help either - I have to fully reset and play solo for them to work properly.
---
Right? I've personally only ever completed one playthrough but I have countless hours logged on 3, 4, and especially NV, just from exploring on new characters and finding new lore things I missed on a previous.
---
Yeah... I'm so pissed about the 0 updates so far
---
The reason it's more expensive is because they are no longer random. It will be there next time. Grahm also sells them. You can stumble upon him randomly wandering low level areas. Vault 76, Tyler County Fairground, Welch, Top of the World, etc.
---
Thanks for sharing, more people reading, more people reporting issues I hope
---
I strongly agree with all of his points, and I believe the things he listed is why this game has seen a reduced player base (and reddit/discord activity), as well as scored an abysmal 50% on all aggregates.
---
Are they going to No Man's Sky this and dump a lot of resources over the next year or two to make it the game it should have been? Or are they going to Mass Effect: Andromeda this and move on as quickly as they can, leaving behind a game as broken as their promises?
---
Thx so much! Very appreciated! Take care!

As far I can tell there's only one plan, combat armor, and it's bought in Harpers ferry. Any other torso has a mod, your best bet is to find a mod spawn and server hop.

They need to get the bugs first
---
And what did you say to Bethesda's QA team when you found them?
---
At this point it's just Josh the intern, sitting in his computer closet and crying.
---
Last patch brought a "few" bugs back
---
 thats more effort than you are worth.
---
That's basically what it is now. Just replace TSE with Bloody. Not much nothing to do. Buggy as fuck.
---
All of us ‚Äúwant‚Äù to keep playing. The sad fact is that most of us are serious fans of fallout and this game is absolutely destroying the community. 
---
The devs are not actively reading these subs, and the basic responses they have given the community are absolutely trash. They make one post in the sub and all the gushing idiots rush to take up defense. 
---
Those of you who are accepting of the game in its current state are a detriment to this community.  
---
You're a moron.

This limited fisherman gear ain‚Äôt worth shit if you ask me 300 atoms maybe 500 for skins sounds reasonable, you should be able to make those atoms on the week given if you played and beat the daily challenges much like a season pass that we already paid ( some over 200 dollars ) 
---
Not make you cough 10 dollars weekly for some random ‚Äúlimited ‚Äú item that you can‚Äôt even wear armor in top ....
---
10X52= 5200 plus base game price plus membership for online etc it stacks and if you based the performance and the promises given it‚Äôs normal to be upset and try to rattle the cage until somebody finally notices
---
But as long as we have suckers paying for shit like that we are constantly going to get our money taken by privately own companies that only see number they don‚Äôt care if jack or Jill are having a safe fun time.
---
They care about the money and to move on and take as much money as they can before they ‚Äúkill‚Äù the service online in a forseable future and move on with out money but as consumers / gamers it won‚Äôt matter since it‚Äôs on their terms of service their game and they could do whatever they want anytime.

You have tokens that do nothing for amusement machines that do nothing. You have Commie Whackers but you can't use them in whack-a-mole like in Fallout 4 even though the whack-a-mole machines are right there. You have an elaborately made fourtune teller machine that is just background decoration. All of these things should be able to be interacted with.

If I had more strength of will I would never buy another TakeTwo or EA or Ubisoft game. The only reason EA still gets some is because a family member loves the Sims so I buy every damn expansion and pack, when they are on sale mostly. I got RDR2 because I don't know I guess I have a soft spot for Rockstar, even though I detest their whole GTA Online microtransaction model that preys on kids begging their parents for Shark Cards. I can't say I have noticed many "Professional" shills from other companies, but definitely seen a few people shilling different games that they are interested in or playing and enjoying in a casual manner. I can usually spot marketers and shills though if I pay enough attention to a particular venue, as I have spent a lot of time on this subreddit for a while. Maybe I get my wires crossed and maybe I do forget my med-X sometimes. I just want organic discussions and criticisms to be aired and regular votes or no votes because that is BS that these systems can be manipulated so easily.
---
Definitely not a troll and I understand the need for quality and I expect good quality products. I‚Äôll happily admit that FO76 is a broken mess, I won‚Äôt disagree there. Of course it‚Äôs a real quest line, if it wasn‚Äôt real then it wouldn‚Äôt be in the game. In my opinion the writing, the voice acting and the pacing of the quests are spot on, and the immersion I feel is genuine. Playing through the Overseer‚Äôs Journey &amp; Mission storyline was amazing storytelling. A lack of NPC‚Äôs isn‚Äôt laziness at all, it‚Äôs different, it‚Äôs a change of pace. You obviously hate the direction the storytelling was taken and you hate the choices were made. If I am the only person who genuinely adores everything about the story, then that‚Äôs cool too. I‚Äôm not here to piss on you while you‚Äôre on fire, I‚Äôm simply here with a differing opinion to you. Personally I wish Bethesda had gotten rid of all the robot NPC‚Äôs as well as not having humanoid NPC‚Äôs as it would have added to the atmosphere. The ability to use your imagination and wonder what it was like prior to everyone turning into a scorched is superb, because we as players are given the tools to interpret what it was like. Take DayZ for example where there was little to no storytelling devices whatsoever and players are left to their own devices and come up with their own stories, that‚Äôs going to the extreme and people enjoy that. I feel Bethesda has given us a sandbox with which to play in, gave us the tools we need to stay immersed and involved and basically said, go roleplay by rebuilding Appalachia together. In conclusion, I feel that NPC‚Äôs would detract from the loneliness and emptiness we as players were intended to feel, but the way Bethesda has chosen to deliver their story in this particular case works well. Do I think it‚Äôs perfect? Hell no, for instance why are there no more quests or activities that help us to truly rebuild and reshape Appalachia? Yes we can build CAMPS, but that‚Äôs it and 9 times out of 10 we have to relocate them which is piss poor in my opinion. I could go on and on about what is wrong with this game but I truly believe the storytelling devices in Fallout 76 are a positive, not a negative 
---
I can‚Äôt believe you would buy not one but two copies of this shit game. People like you are the reason Fallout sucks as bad as it does nowadays.
---
When I get disconnects usually it occurs a few times in a row and then works well. 
---
After I collected all 20 mags for myself I tried to pass them off to a friend so he wouldn't have to go looking too and it didn't work. I believe you have to find and pick them up yourself. Same goes for bobbleheads.

Is there a specific aid item that is causing it?

I'll read whatever I want to read and I'll say whatever I feel like saying, kid.

As far as #2, some mods exist that cannot be attached because the mod exists but the modcol for the attachment slot is missing the mod, I am unable to identify either. I guess the ones I remembered could have been patched. But I also cannot find the original Reddit/Wiki article links either.

Don't use the targetting HUD!

Well ill just stop commenting since apperantly im the plague that keeps terrible games alive i want it to be far better yes but i guess throwing it in a fire like most people is the right thing to do only seems logical i guess

If you run into the specific mod or find it let me know, as j keep checking the files I'll keep my eyes open

Is there any evidence that Obsidian could do better though? New Vegas came out 8 years ago now, and much of the team who worked on it have long since left. Also, New Vegas was far buggier than FO3, Skyrim and FO4 at release, and it's post release patching was worse than FO4's or Skyrim's.
---
Yeah, the Obsidian that made New Vegas did a fantastic job with quest design, but they released a far buggier mess than anything Bethesda have done (sans FO76).
---
It would be different if Obsidian had been releasing a steady stream of games in the eight years since, all of which matching the quality and scale of New Vegas in some way. But that hasn't been the case. Hopefully Outer Worlds is good, and hopefully Obsidian prove they are still the same studio who made New Vegas, but there's no evidence that this will be the case - only hope.
---
And you're not a passenger, no reason to always get mad about it and post angry letters.
---
You again... Please go back to duping
---
\[T]/
---
you could check your own comment history (that you didnt remember to scrub) and come to the same conclusion. Asking me to screen shot it is trolling in itself.
---
Why are people still playing this game though? I‚Äôm actually interested in a response
---
What do you think can stop this game from dying? It's massively bleeding at the moment and no one seems to really be working on it anymore. I've seen Korean F2p Cashgrabs that weren't this bad. What can they do to turn it around?
---
I can confirm. I'm playing FO4 right now and scrapper is almost a necessity early on.
---
Not even hardcore cave crickets :(
---
If you just drop your camp in a new location it will bluprint the whole thing for you.  I dont even know why blue print is a manual option.  I have a massive building with a maxed out budget and if i find a clear area i can drop camp and place the whole 4 story building.

When you have nothing else to say- resort to bringing up duping

There are owls in game... naked ones like the chickens. I have seen one in the toxic valley... just one though.

At this point a lot of us don‚Äôt.

Seriously! A lot of the issues are basic things that any medium level modder could make in xEdit in a few minutes.

I think you know how to make this automatically.

ESO isn't nearly this bad. Not even at launch. And now it's extremely superior to FO76.

Yeah they are I said NV since most people in this reddit are familiar with that game.
---
What other sub? 
---
There‚Äôs a bunker close to vault 76 with a cryo chamber and some alien rounds 
---
That was a huge surprise running into one there.
---
It‚Äôs possible but there are also other items that you can‚Äôt mod, they won‚Äôt disappear from the list, just the modify/repair buttons greyed out. So it‚Äôs likely still a glitch. Once you quit the workbench and go back in, the axe will show up again. 
---
76 is the creature of corporate gaming - it‚Äôs a money grab 
---
What does that accomplish? Lmao you know how many people have used exploits to enjoy FO76? More than you‚Äôd imagine apparently 
---
probably 1-2 interns.

The Nuka Quantum Grenade's blast radius is about as big around as the grenade is itself. Basically, you have to throw the grenade and hope the enemy catches it and holds onto it for it to do any damage. This is despite being crafted from a more expensive/rare Nuka Cola than the Nuka Grenade which has a huge huge blast radius.

Why do constantly bith about a game that you claim to not play, just go!

The main problem for me is the disconnects/very very minor bugs that add up (loot loading etc) if they fix that I feel like more people would give the game a shot

I‚Äôve ever needed to repair my 45 power armor and I‚Äôve even upgraded some pieces as I started with 35s just to finish the damn quest and it still never needs repair. Love it! Power cores are a different story though now that they seem to get slurped up faster and are harder to find.

No, there are more. I run into one frequently at the Bog Town (I think that‚Äôs the name) workshop in Cranberry Bog, where the mutants like to hang out. He isn‚Äôt always there, but I‚Äôve had him there a couple times, and have also had a hermit crab spawn there.

Will do!

It‚Äôs actually really entertaining talking to delusional fanboys in this sub
---
Bloodied with only 20% health is decent damage, but you are running around with only 40ish hit points. Op's damage also includes adrenal reactions mutation, so he's effectively getting the bloodied effect twice. You can also get the nerd rage perk, and get further damage bonus for low health.
---
Bloodied isn't just a weapon effect, it's a way of life (way of death, pretty frequently, also).
---
Mags have to be used
---
Or maybe this dude just liked the story? Its mind blowing when I see every day someone make basically this same exact thread said slighty differently from the last, then they're unable to process when people who liked the story reply to it with their opinion. Did you make this thread because you just wanted a typical echo chamber in here? 
---
The 4 people still working on 76: shit time to nerf reactive plates
---
I got my vampire shishkebab at 144 combine damage, same as ski sword, but thats as high i can get it...sad i love using it. Its actually still ok to use, if i prep... good armor/power, food and water good, as least radiation as possible, then i can take on a hoard of enemys and as long as i dont get too much radiation from any, my health slowly goes up as i furiously chop away. without that perk though (vampire) prob would not use it.
---
This was noticed (and reported) right after big patch. It was recognized as having returned but was not addressed in the last patch which patched the big patch. Now, if we could just patch what the big patch returned we'd could positively say that we received one working patch even though they've released multiple patches. mAke SeNsE?
---
It‚Äôs actually really entertaining talking to delusional fanboys in this sub though 
---
&gt; In what galaxy does this make sense?

The same one where a .308 does more damage than a .50
---
The atom store itself makes no bones about the fact it‚Äôs a premium storefront. 
---
You CAN earn atoms in game, yes, but you can‚Äôt buy everything through this method. The timed sales are the perfect example of this. Their current monetisation model is, release new store content, have players ditch their surplus of atoms on new content. Then a day later release a timed cosmetic that you now must buy premium currency to acquire as there‚Äôs no possible way to earn in game, in under 24 hours The number of atoms needed to buy said timed item when you‚Äôve already spent your surplus. But technically, If you didn‚Äôt buy everything, and hoarded atoms just for the occasional timed cosmetic, you COULD buy it without spending a penny.
---
At least we aren‚Äôt getting loot boxes containing rng cosmetics that you have to buy a friggin key for a la literally every FPS since team fortress 2.
---
I get that you like to troll people who enjoy the game... Maybe you should get some help
---
Hey man, changing a single value is REALLY tough and should be treated like a MAJOR part of an update instead of the 2 second job it actually is 
---
I agree RDR2 is boring af. At least there is interesting stuff to do in fo76, mechanics to mess with, upgrading weapons, pa, armour etc among many other things to do 
---
If you are truly wanting to see the game improve then at this point the best thing to do is probably take a break. Developers ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to server counts. 
---
&gt;15 mutations
---
Those are rookie numbers.
---
It‚Äôs still fucked
---
I'd suggest trying out previous Fallout titles before this one. Previous titles do have their faults, but they are currently more polished than 76 and have mods available to fix bugs. You could get lucky and be one of the ones that have hardly any problems, but I wouldn't want 76 to turn you off from all Fallout games. 
---
The worst part is that they literally made scrapper useless so it‚Äôs not even something that should need balancing if they‚Äôd just copy pasted the perk into the game. 
---
If this was a brand new never before seen perk, and they were just being Bethesda and never bothered to fix the awfulness, then I‚Äôd understand it‚Äôs suckiness. But these dudes went out of their way to make the perk useless and literally took a useful perk that already existed and was regarded as pretty good, put it in a **more** junk intensive game, and then nerfed the shit out of it. Why even include it in the game? To teach players to not pick bad perks? I know they said this was an experiment, but it‚Äôs like they actively went out to make certain parts of it infuriating rather than challenging. 
---
I swear this feels like deja vu watching this unfold after watching stuff unfold on r/starwarsbattlefront the past year (obviously much different case at the start but went through a similar phase it feels like). You‚Äôd think someone at Bethesda  would‚Äôve watched how they handled the post launch support and take notes on what not to do, obviously not. It‚Äôs possible for this game to come back if they buckle down, release fixes quicker and actually take community feedback seriously. 
---
&gt; I've never made any claims that these were anything more than my opinions.
---
And yet you are declaring theses opinions as if they are cold hard facts. 
---
&gt; Well yeah, I mean now they are. Now that their game tanked and they have to. And their fixes are poor at best, and more often than not require their own fixing. My entire point is that they don't need it reiterated again. If they've been listening as you put it, we don't need them to ask again. Their TSE gun fix was myopic and fails to address the root issues. Which has been explained ad nauseam.
---
They were always going to do that for content that needed improvement. The funny part is people legitimately thinking they will scrap whole game and start over from scratch. 
---
And no the TSE gun fix was the correct way with long term thinking in mind. The gun was massively over powered compared to other legendary weapons. And it so massively over powered all normal non legendary guns to the point it was like trying to compare a BB gun to a battleship cannon.  Increasing all weapons damage only creates power creep which causes problems. GTA Online is a great example of how power creep can fuck up any game balance there is. Destiny 2 even has it's examples of power creep in weapons when dealing with PvP in the Crucible. 
---
When you combine all the perks a TSE gun could do 5x base damage of weapon which was so fucking OP as shit. And as much as people want PvP to become a thing on this game. When you have a weapon that is literally capable of one hit killing a player across the map. PvP will never properly take off with that kind of unbalanced bullshit. 
---
Now people complain about melee being OP. Save for the fact melee has a very limited range of attack. There are literally hundreds of encounters that if I had to melee mobs to death I would have died. I survived because my range weapons allowed me to avoid taking damage while taking cheap shots at the mobs.  And as one very annoying player learned it doesn't matter if you have a super sledge. If you can't get close to me you can't hit me with it. I how ever can hit you with a .44 magnum.  
---
&gt; I read what you said. What do you want me to do, a goddamn cartwheel?
---
Yes please do a cart wheel.
---
&gt; No, my words are indicating the intention. And if you think Bethesda thinks highly of your intelligence, you haven't been paying attention.
---
I think Bethesda doesn't care about my intelligence only about my attitude towards them. Shitting on people who are only doing their jobs is something ass holes do and is the bane of any service industry.
---
&gt; Again, would have been awesome if they did that before launch. Apparently now we need to help them fix their mess.
---
Once again why? The amount of people on the game before launch was a fraction of the total people on the game now.   What makes the couple thousand people who preordered the game better at giving feed back then the hundreds of thousands now playing the game? How do you know their feed back is correct?
---
You never address this point at all. 
---
&gt; Don't what? There is one kind of beta test. A beta test. Just because you bought into their marketing spin doesn't make it any less of a waste of time. It was a demo for preorders. Heck, there wasn't even a wipe. It was a glorified early access.
---
And early access gets wiped. The whole thing was a server stress test.  I've been a part of a couple of game betas in my time. Each time it was primarily to test the servers out. Because there have been many high profile examples of games coming out and servers being over loaded and people being unable to play. The latest Sim City for example with it's required online internet connection.  The few that were not just server stress test were when they were actively trying to over haul combat system or some other system in the game. So they opened up a beta for people to try and give feed back on before they released the massive game system over haul. 
---
The betas you are talking about last months not a couple of weeks.  Ark Survival Evolved for example was a beta that lasted months while they ironed out the issues before it was officially released on all consoles. 
---
&gt; Only now that their game has the lowest score the company has ever experienced, are they putting forth a fraction of the effort they should have back when they had time to make a better first impression.
---
You drastically underestimate how petty people are. The second it wasn't perfect nothing would ever change the screams and screeches of how much they messed up. Just look at FO4.  Guy was complaining about the weak story and degrading quality so asked for specifics. After a little back and forth he posted several videos of you tubers complaining about the game. Which ironically is what I mocked them for in the first place because their frist responds was to watch oxhorn rather then give me specifics.  Those videos complained about such grand problems as not being able to drink out of toilets. The continuation of the constantly conflicting story of how ghouls work.  That the X-01 Power armor was a pre war prototype that the Enclave would create the advanced power armor out of as a production model.  And the grand shining example of lore break that a terminal says that Jet was being delivered to a vault. Which would imply that Jet was a pre war chem rather then a post war chem.  That tiny insignificant lore break is apparently the smoking gun of degrading story and lore. Never mind that FO2 already did a similar bit that when called out the game lead had to issue a correction about it.
---
&gt; It tested nothing but server capability. They knew their games was an unfinished, broken mess.
---
Based on? You do realize that how a game performs in ideal test conditions isn't how it works outside of it right?
---
I have recently travelled to my camp and one of the in-world suitcases had almost 100 pieces of ballistic fiber, over 400 pieces of black titanium, over 200 of ultracite, fiberglass and fiber optics. That was a good day ;)
---
Can confirm. Husband and I are suckers and wanted to be able to play together. I got the collectors edition for him for our anniversary and we got another copy for me.
---
Now we definitely learned our lesson though. I've been looking forward to the next TES game for years (logged over 1000 hrs on skyrim and more than I know on Oblivion) but it wont be a buy-at-release game for us now. Hopefully if its good we won't get spoilers.
---
Wrong! This game was and is not marketed as PvP. It is marketed as a co-op fallout which is a PVE game. Here's the exact wording from Bethesda's Amazon description 
---
" Reclamation Day, 2102. Twenty-five years after the bombs fall, you and your fellow Vault Dwellers‚Äîchosen from the nation‚Äôs best and brightest ‚Äì emerge into post-nuclear America. Play solo or join together as you explore, quest, build, and triumph against the wasteland‚Äôs greatest threats." 
---
Most people who play PvP are young adults whose hormones are out of whack, the crave for violence and destruction simmers down as a person matures.  Which in your case is yet to occur. Are you that pathetic IRL that you need to fight somebody in a virtual setting to make yourself feel empowered? Real men who have any sort of self confidence would rather put their time and effort on constructive/productive things be it in real life or in a virtual setting. 
---
Sounds good! 
---
Chill
---
You start off apologizing for sounding like one of those people.
---
And then you sound just like one of those people. So not really an apology. More like, you are giving yourself an excuse for doing something that you know makes you sound like a jerk. 
---
Second, you sound like a jerk  talking about getting slapped in the face with a dick. Much experience having that happen by the way? 
---
Here's the thing. They can do hotfixes whenever they want for PCs. not for console games. Xbox and PS are not very keen on letting companies hotfix games. Everytime Bethesda has an update, they have to pay for that. And just because they may want to do a hotfix, Xbox and PS may not let them. Those companies have some say in that.
---
Not to mention, everytime they have to update the game, there's all these steps they have to do. So having them do that more frequently just means more work. And the more times they do it, the more chances of introducing new mistakes. 
---
As for the patch notes being week. I'm guessing your talking about this weeks, Inside the vault. True, it was skimpy. But it's not patch notes. it's just a peek into something we should see soon, with patch 6. It is not a full comprehensive list of everything. It's never been meant to be. The patches always include way more than what we see in talked about with ITV.   
---
Saying they don't listen is complete crap. They started posting weekly ITV because people demanded they have some sort of update, even if it was just, this is what we are currently looking/working on. 
---
Second, one of the things in the last ITV, was a subject that has been big on the reddit for a long time. The sonic attack of the scorchbeast. They said there will be 10 seconds between sonic attacks. I mean, if that's not listening to the players, then maybe you don't understand what the word means. 
---
You are the ones that are too impatient. You demand now, without ever realizing what now means. 
---
So, I don't accept your apology for sound like one of those guys, when you were meaning to sound like one of those guys all along. 
---
I know they do it sad i love the game but seeing people actually breaking their copies or uninstalling sucks and then when the time comes the game has god tier update people who did all that will still shit on Bethesda for "making them lose there copy" idk man ive taken breaks but we all know no knew games for another week or two cause everyone decided to release in Feb or even later on
---
I like that idea I would love yelling mr gutsy lines at people while shooting a gun on an arm
---
Actually. I don‚Äôt think they have a very big crew to start with. Beta was basically fallout 4 hosted on the internet with other people on it.
---
Pretty everything was working before last patch
---
I liked all the fallouts except this one. After 20 hours I looked down at my controller, then up at my screen, and couldn‚Äôt figure out why I was doing what I was doing. There was no reason to play. The pvp in the game is atrocious, and the enemies in game come in two varieties. The ‚ÄòI die in one hit‚Äô enemies, and the ‚Äòhahaha I am immortal‚Äô enemies. Bugs rampant. Haven‚Äôt picked it up again.
---
This is true. I have encountered him in several locations such as near Morganown. 
---
The location in Charleston is a spawn point, but just like any spawn location that has a camp on it, the camp stops the spawn in that location only.
---
My first camp was located just between flatwoods and overseers camp. Right on the flat bit of land where you can find random spawns such as crashed vertibot or the grave etc. While I was there, they wont spawn. But they can spawn elsewhere. Same thing with the vendor spawn.
---
Should there not be a camp there, then he could spawn. Or not. Its random. 
---
Godly power
---
&gt;Bethesda's name has already been sullied in thousands... even millions of people's minds.
---
To be fair, this won't affect them at all. Look at what happened to Bioware after Andromeda, and look at how many people are hyped for Anthem.
---
No matter how bad FO76 is, or how much worse it gets, TES:VI is still going to make bank.
---
Yup, everyone is dead or at least long gone.  Or maybe not long gone as their bodies are just sitting there to decompose but aren't really in any state of decay - I mean, you have packs of wild dogs wandering around but nothing has decided to go chomp on the corpses sitting in a church.  
---
I felt so disconnected with the quests that I agree, I didn't see a purpose. I cannot feel a connection to the robots.  I normally can't stand raiders, but I would have at least felt a connection to Rosie had she been alive, even a ghoul, but nope.  '
---
And since, as I expected, the vast majority of people don't want to roleplay, the whole "Other players are the NPCs" just falls flat.  
---
Even the Overseer is just a faceless character you chase endlessly.  
---
Funny, that‚Äôs also my same run for lead. Hit or miss I usually run into somebody whose doing the same thing. 
---
Well thats it for me pals, i hear nothing but negative shit on this sub and the worst part is that i think its all true even though ive never played the game. Good fucking chance you missed with this one bethesda, goodbye
---
Okay,I guess I‚Äôll try fallout 3 first because it‚Äôs in the game pass for free at the moment.
---
These days I just claim the munitions workshop.
---
I don‚Äôt know but protest march never fucking works
---
Yeah I figured a lot of people do this. But it's not just these 3 locations its every damn place I go to. Empty!!!! Its frustrating I've dealt with a lot of bugs here but this seals the deal
---
That, and it was too hard to get NPCs to work with more than 1 hero character in their spaghetti code. So they just scrapped NPCs altogether.
---
Your vault is open, you and your colleagues are alive so its nit just for you but for me and your neighbor and the other vaults that haven't opened yet.
---
Thank you 
---
Wow, what a bunch of entitled crap. 
---
My character has a wife and a few buddies. They are characters played by my wife and a couple of buddies. I can't answer where *your* character's spouse/children/parents/friends are.
---
You can probably find it cheaper elsewhere. My friends got it for around 10$ on PC. I'd say 20$ is a fair price, but it'll be more fun with 2 friends. 
---
Does this really work now? Are the "items are floating" errors gone?
---
Bloodied.
---
Personally, I‚Äôm waiting for dlc and mods. 
---
Once you‚Äôve done what little there is, there‚Äôs no reason to continue playing. 
---
I have high hopes that mod authors will run with some fun game fix ideas. 
---
And those other vault dwellers are doing it themselves. So if my character wasn't there what would change?
---
In terms of frame rate, that feels better to me.
---
It has FOV slider and PTT now. 
---
Other than that it's 99% the same as it was on day 10. Still fun for a few days. I had fun for 2 or 3 days atleast. 
---
I gave it a shot. Got up to L5, I think and the game is like, "So, you understand all the myriad mechanics we've run you through on this tutorial, so we're going to dump 6 more layers of mechanics on you all at the same time!"  
---
I instantly NOPEd out and uninstalled it.
---
It's kind of heartwarming to see this sub used to discuss something like this. I like it.
---
You‚Äôd get screws, copper, and a few other uncommon mats from just one rank in scrapper in fallout four. The second would get you more rare materials like fiber optics and the last one just increased the amount you got from rank one and two. It‚Äôs pretty different from 76.
---
So that's not a "Hurry" 
---
I'm pretty sure they know, they're in touch with the teams anyways. Likely they're told not to tell us, because if we found out that they've basically given up on this game then we'd stop playing and they don't want that
---
Your last sentence epitomizes my point and is exactly why it happens. People in general are easy to influence. I completely understand where you're coming from I myself was very disappointed in the latest inside the vault, and much more of this and Bethesda enters the "new" Bioware territory in my mind.
---
Yeah, not quite. There are plenty of people who know the game isn't good, but still have fun playing it (mostly with friends probably), but whatever, just continue insulting people who don't have the same views as you, they are definitely not the simple minded ones here.
---
Also, rule 4.
---
Ps4 - when first loading into the world there is a bug where if you press the pip boy button too early, your character becomes frozen indefinitely. The only way for me to fix this several times has been to leave the server. Also if you press 'play' on the main menu before the 'Atomic Shop' option appears, the player will spawn in with a blank emote wheel.
---
fallout 3 is epic :) enjoy 
---
So what kind of super special snowflake are you?
---
Ty I added you so did my gf
---
I get the appeal of it... The whole game is built around buffing different stats. 
---
You can play how you want, but if you did not enjoy it it is pretty much your own fault: you choose to play that way.
---
Are you gonna follow all of my posts now?
---
It's funny how *I'm* the one with the wasted life, acoodding to you. Mind your manners, now. 
---
I added you so did my gf
---
I agree, Fallout 76 should be a film not a game.
---
You should not only uninstall 76, but feel free to uninstall Reddit so we don‚Äôt have to hear about it 
---
Inb4 some loser whines about entitlem- Woops too late.
---
They didn't learn when they killed Mass Effect and they probably won't learn now. People are dumb what can we do my man.
---
.....and decorating packs so we can put pans on our stoves, food plates and cutlery on our tables, cuddly toys on our shelves, clean brick wall interiors, teapots, etc (I need clutter lol)
---
Each of my friends when they fast travel, spawn in my camp.  I either have to destroy my house or they have to waste Caps to spawn nearby.  This is a must!
---
You got lvl 15 loot from a lvl 68 bloated glowing ghoul?
---
While we're at it, a Gutsy chest armor would be cool. Those Gutsy's can really take a beating. Or a Gutsy mod to power armor that makes you round LOL!
---
Melee radiation children of atom build was my favorite in fallout 4
---
Every time somebody says '*when in pacifist novody should be able to damage my camp*' I think they have no idea how exploitable that is for *somebody else* griefing.
---
Imagine a try hard from GTA with no cool down on passive mode. Sheeeeeeeeeet.
---
I saw it for 26‚Ç¨ on cd keys but I don‚Äôt like buying at 3rd party sites or having it as a disc
---
Eh it's just one dude who started following me around. I don't really mind.
---
Most of the people like that have moved on. The way I see it, they were never REALLY interested in the game. They just wanted defend the corporation. 
---
I think the explosion radius of the Nuka Quantum grenade looks like an oversight or bug. The current radius makes them useless. I included the suggestion for changing the way grenades/explosions work, not to get it included in the official list and get a ticket created, but rather, to just to put the suggestion out there for people to think about.
---
Hey, let's make Fallout like Fortnight! For realz! We could make bank! Dis good idea. I get paid big bucks. - Bethesda Exec
---
Shouldn't you be able to discover that along with your character then? Bethesda kinda screwed us over by telling us. 
---
I know the game alternates spawning mutants and scorched. Good luck 
---
I play in PA because its almost mandatory. If you choose not to, you gotta spend so many perk points
---
Wasn't made by the same developers. Zenimax made eso
---
I don‚Äôt think too many people actually had physical copies to break. The digital Versions can be reinstalled at a later date.  Most of the anger you are seeing is just a bit of a fit, and rightfully so, from folks that are pissed at the games state.  I have quit logging in, I did so the day after-ish the mega nerf update. I still own the game  yet I have chosen not to log in until the devs actually make some effort. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty confident that most people that have quit, have quit in hopes of getting the devs attention and getting them to move. If the devs move quick enough then I‚Äôd imagine a lot of the players will return. I‚Äôd the devs wait too long then the sad fact is that another game will come along and absorb the players that have quit. At this point the only people who can save the game are the devs. 
---
This community has done more than enough to help
---
the game with user created content. We have set up markets, Discord‚Äôs, Clans, Vaults, etc...  No other game has had so much from a community in such a short time. We have done our part, Plus. 
---
It‚Äôs time for the folks who gladly took our money to live up to the hype we were promised. 
---
What makes you think they aren't? Because of one skimpy Inside the Vault?
---
The fact that we get anything every week is pretty amazing from a company this big. I've worked on big projects for big companies. Nothing moves fast enough for the audience. Nothing. 
---
Sorry, but the impatience is your own doing. We had a patch on the 29th. It's 10 days later. They had a hotfix two days later. 
---
if timer is at 29 something when u find it. go to roof and stand at corner where it blinks for 10sec and it updates
---
I have over 100 extra plans only plans left to are 5000 cap plans
---
I hate people down playing actual characters in a  mp setting.  Having them helps the player feel attached to the world and actually want to be there. I wouldnt be playing eso if not for alot of engaging stories and interesting characters to interact with.
---
You‚Äôre right of course. Being slapped with a dick is s bit much, but the rest of your post is accurate. 
---
Frustrating event where the SB sometimes never come or you the button doesn't activate. It's very buggy, along with The Messenger, Swarm of Suitors, Protest March, and some of the Horde Events. Dont even get me started with dailies
---
Bump
---
Its the dumbest thing to not have people alive and actively help them fight off the virus as part of the launch story.
---
Not new but I have a question.... do scorchbeast bones have a purpose because they do not auto scrap, are they needed for something you craft that I just haven‚Äôt crafted yet or part of a side quest I‚Äôve missed along the way? Just curious
---
He/she is part of a group of about 5-10 of the same names I see downvoted into oblivion, who endlessly post variants of "lol u mad bro" and "fine, leave already".
---
Yes, all ye toxic white knights... you absolutely want all of us who WANT to love the game, despite Bethesda's "best" efforts, to leave. Then you can enjoy deserted servers to yourself right until the final death knell all too soon.
---
You can obviously see how many people agree with you by the amount of upvotes your getting.  
---
Im glad i got it with a bundle so i got the console and game for cheaper but like most people i would never preorder no matter the company its a practice that i do belive is not very good free betas are rad but paid eh
---
I COULD hoard them but what about those sweet sweet neon signs 
---
Personally I‚Äôm not sure but now I‚Äôve gotta check if I have any scorchbeast bones laying around my stash!!
---
This was the one time everything seemed to be going well until the server decided to screw with me üòÇ 
---
Here's a protip, if *you* uninstall reddit, you'll never see it. The only downside is you can't go your entire life without differing opinions.
---
To be serious, though. You guys really shouldn't be worried about criticism this late. It's pretty much been killed in the mainstream. If you're going to tell the 5 people who actually still play not to criticize, then you might aswell just put the bullet in the game yourself. 
---
Ill be on today and tomorrow, send me your gamertag (by message is fine)
---
The thing is, NV is what allows the hipsters (‚ÄúI was into Fallout before it was popular!‚Äù) to play a modern Fallout while still claiming to hate Bethesda. 
---
Mega Sloth I agree with everything in your post, a french Youtuber should read  this post....(Lusty very good by the way)
---
Love this game do not care about the explo nerf even if I passed 50level more or less to get mine.
---
I have big hope for patch 6.
---
 For me this game is a kind of new ¬´¬†concept¬†¬ª in videogame industrie. 
---
And I‚Äôm happy that it‚Äôs a Fallout franchise.
---
This game is in advance of 5 or 10 years !
---
EA never changes. Apparently, neither does Bethesda... it was just the incredible work of dedicated modders keeping their games going.
---
The absolute laundry list of mods I'll be installing when I stay playing FO4 soon (I was stuck in an endless loop of replaying Mass Effect and clinging to WoW) is almost daunting.
---
Idk the documentary has em saying everyone at Beth worked on the game but that could been a lie lol.
---
It's pretty simple left side is posiden, middle is mohoan and far right is thunder mountain, just look at the map it's.pretty easy to figure out.
---
&gt;Where are the birds?
---
What about the elusive rad chicken?
---
Fair enough, I hope it goes on a more reasonable sale on the store 
---
He's like Grahm, he has several locations where he spawns. However, I'm going to provide a counter argument: the Camps do block the random event trigger from occurring. The location you have provided is actually less convenient than Charleston Station since it doesn't have a vendor and stash. You can incorporate the hunt for the wandering vendor in your normal vendor run. 
---
I camp near one of these spots, but I don't place my camp in a position that blocks the event from occurring.  It seems rude to place your camp in such away that blocks other people from enjoying the game. There are plenty of places that have water in the area, or just use the campfire method of placing water purifiers. I can understand a level 15 setting up the camp there while they are working their way through the missions, but there's zero reason for a level 188 to be doing it. It's actually more frustrating than people who put booby-traps on the main roads. Camp responsibly. 
---
Looks like they wont even no man sky it. Going on 5 months soon without anything major added.
---
I‚Äôm really hoping they at least bring back raiders.  Could justify it as the result of a vault opening or an invading force from neighboring regions. 
---
If they increase stash size I might throw a couple in there in case they‚Äôre related to future content in anyway
---
The entire game is a colony of bugs
---
No it isn't. It's about helping people who aren't alive who couldn't finish their work to prevent the scorched plague. You're continuing their work.
---
True, I suppose it's just a matter of opinion in that case
---
What's a negweg?
---
there's usually one laying next to the fusion core generator at Poseidon. I find at least one on ghouls after doing the rounds at WS. Then before I log off I kill a sentry bot at WS , they give a core. I dunno, I travel around a LOT and find them all over the place, just laying around and the more enemies you kill the more you get. I have 11 in my inventory right now, after having 3 when I started last night; it's just about going all over the place, opening all the containers and killing a lot of enemies I guess. Not so easy for low levels -- if you are low level, I recommend taking Poseidon and holding it for as long as you can. It's not hard to take. 
---
I recommend waiting until you see "powering up Poseidon" and do that quest, to power it up 100 percent. Then use the 1000 energy to power up at least the fusion core genny. Set up some defenses, defend the workshop when the quest comes up, hold it as long as you can and you'll have cores for days
---
*furiously stashing 64 "free watoga" fliers* don't judge 
---
Are they because im pretty sure they are busy at the Whitesprings.
---
The game has NPCs though
---
If it's so easy to figure out, how do you know which ones don't have a box?
---
Agree on the radius, and the stagger should be a no-brainer,'I mean it's an explosion!  
---
Knock down would be an awesome add,'but that would be more QoL personally, but would also be easy enough to test and then add
---
Paying full price for something that barely works and was sold on false pretenses means you are absolutely entitled to complain. We all PURCHASED a consumer product. We are literally supposed to be entitled to a functioning product because that is what we paid for. Thats how transactions work. If the game was free the entitlement would be unjustified, but it wasn't.
---
I didn't realize that. Thanks! 
---
Me too. I have 32 bulk springs. and 500 screws, I just gave away 200 in a cash register somewhere
---
Base RadResist of Power Armor is ~500.  Someone else had suggested a compromise that we be able to wear the Damaged Hazmat Suit(500RR) over regular armor.  I thought it was a good idea.
---
Thanks for anther bandwagon post
---
https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-76/Treasure_Maps Here ya go. Makes it a bit easier for those not good at deciphering vague clues on legal pads 
---
Wait. Where does he keep the third one? He only has two hands.
---
Do you see how fast all other games update their games? Why is Bethesda exempt from criticism?
---
They literally forked an old build and made a patch on it
---
I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that they release ‚ÄúScorchbone Heavy Armor‚Äù at some point
---
I‚Äôve just recently started playing a different game, and they were able to hotfix the game twice in the same day while AAA Bethesda needs an announcement, a week to prepare, a week to hotfix, and a week to hotfix the hotfix. If indie companies can do it TWICE IN A DAY why can‚Äôt triple A companies?
---
Well, either crash or DC, yes. I don't keep track of which is which. I use the Perk Loadout Manager mod, and that's responsible for about 50% of my client crashes since I crash when I bring up the perk screen sometimes (maybe 1 in 100 times). But that mod is so worth it, I'll keep the functionality and live with the client crashes.
---
The Targeting HUD has a specific type of client crash you can recognize. Basically, you fast travel to an area or you get someplace just before a random set of mobs would spawn, and before they do spawn, you CTD. I think that's almost assuredly the Targeting HUD.
---
Server DCs and server crashes, I have no idea if I cause any of those. I know if I craft too fast (like boiling water) I can cause server unresponsive messages for everyone on the server (and I know because I plan on a team of 4 and my other 3 teammates always experience the server unresponsive messages at the same time I do when I bulk craft too fast). Sad to know that I, as a single player, can do denial of service attacks on everyone on the server just by doing my normal daily routine of crafting water and food. But the server always recovers after that, and then I go on about my business and just try to craft slower as to not interfere with everyone else on the server. But I do see pretty frequent server DCs or crashes.
---
All in all, I think I get about 1 client crash, server DC, or server crash (where my entire team DCs) about once an hour. And the mix is about 50/50. About once an hour I get a client crash, and about once an hour I get a DC. And about once a night (about 4 hours play) we get a server crash and we all DC.
---
I agree there should not be paid BETA. Unfortunately Bethesda chose to take the scummiest possible route with this game.  I remember how big Turd (Todd) was focused so much on the map being 4X larger, and the game always evolving, ‚ÄúGod lighting‚Äù, blah, blah, blah. When we look back upon all of those promises it‚Äôs clear it was nothing but propaganda used to sell the game in an incomplete state. 
---
The map is 4X larger than Fallout 4, However nearly half of the map is inaccessible!  The game has not evolved even the slightest, and the devs still can‚Äôt address the issue of how to allow time to pass in game.  We are stuck in a short time cycle in game of what 48 hours, then it resets!  Like WTF? I‚Äôm sure we were all
---
Impressed by the ‚ÄúGod Lighting‚Äù Shining through rocks and up out of the ground. Let‚Äôs face it they can‚Äôt even get the mood lighting correct. 
---
Scumthesda took the good faith of the gaming community and abused it to con us out of money. It‚Äôs hard to face but it‚Äôs true!  Can you say you would purchase this game in its current state?  
---
My PSN is Blade_Fighter101 if you want to squad up! 
---
The dev team currently assigned to to updates is not a whole person, but actually just two of Jim's fingers. It's one guy, forced to code with huntpeck typing, so that's why it has taken weeks to address things nexus modders would've fixed twice over by day two.
---
&gt;	I don't get where this idea that Fallout 76 not being a franchise best seller is somehow going to doom BGS or it's future projects.
---
People love drama. 
---
Haven't been to a workshop that doesn't have one, they are hidden well some times though. Wasn't until my 5th take of the munitions plant that I found the box hidden between two yellow panels.
---
Nah. They don't say anything because nothing would acceptable for everyone. You might be ok with 10% bug fixes but someone else wants 90%.
---
Omg hilarious. So your saying other games update every week? 
---
Who said that they were? I said your criticisms are founded on your ignorance.
---
Yes and yes it is.  There's no option to swap it back to a normal one. 
---
No they don‚Äôt.
---
1) the problem is a slot usage conflict, it could be resolved fairly easily, but needs some open mindedness on Bethesda's part.  
---
2) Ummm Stealth Boy mod? The stealth in game is more or less broken as is, and just does not function properly.
---
3) Nice idea... Marine Armor is supposed to be "the best non power armor armor), needs a buff as well IMHO.
---
4) would be great if it was changed to an pure "outfit" rather than armor blocking mess... Or give us a Underarmor version, that would work the same
---
Jesus, do people ever stop complaining? It's not a ridiculous requirement.
---
 I wear t60 exclusively. I have X01 but never wear it, too expensive to repair. But T60 is just plastic and metal and something else easy to get. and with the right perks you RARELY have to repair it. I got calibrated shocks-- I can carry up to 415 pounds if necessary using whiskey, bufftats and grilled radstag. 
---
Great idea
---
No have to find them yourself in world. "Reading" is the initial pop up on your screen when you pick it up. Check the bed and breakfast by Silo Charlie for lots of spawns. 
---
I think there are a bunch of people working on the game. Otherwise there wouldn't be those atomic shop updates and minor buffs per week. But I think the team responsible for the main game (engine, programming, etc.) y are not experienced with games. The other fields like design, storytelling, music, are fine. There are just a lot of bugs and balancing problems.
---
I stumbled over [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios_Austin) enty on wikipedia. BattleCry Studios, now known as Bethesda Game Studios Austin, **has never released a single game.** They developed BattleCry, which developement was halted, worked a little bit on Doom and (co-)developed Fallout 76. In 2017 the (former) president (of BattleCry Studios) left. In March 2018 the studio was rebranded to BGS Austin. And the studio in Austin was the main contributer to the engine and how things work within the game.

&gt;In conjunction with [id Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software) (like Bethesda Softworks a [ZeniMax Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeniMax_Media) subsidiary), BattleCry attempted to integrate id's [*Quake*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(series)) [netcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcode) into *Fallout 4'*s  engine, considered a challenge even by experts in the online game  industry. A primary issue facing the developers was that components of  the core engine (dating back to Gamebryo used in *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind*) such as quests or world loading were designed centering on a single player, a paradigm that would need to fundamentally change to allow multiple players spanning multiple worlds.
---
An inexperienced team works on the core of a AAA multiplayer game?! And merged multiple different parts of different engines/codes together?! Maybe they have really created a mutant (and don't really know how it works)?!
---
So it might take a while till the team is experienced enough to work with the game. We can only hope that they do not seriously break the game, because this is not B.E.T.A. anymore.
---
Nope just picked up
---
Right.  The Enclave is the only faction that seems like it is still around and where your progress feels meaningful.  Everything else is basically grave robbing and trying to continue the work of people who aren't around anymore.
---
&gt;	Unassigned means you have a card that can go into that slot, but you are not using it. So if you have 2 1-point cards and 3 Luck "Unassigned" won't show until you have a 3rd 1-point card that can go in the slot.
---
I was also confused about this, and I must be nearing the 300h mark. Thanks!
---
I‚Äôm about to start enclave and this makes me not even want to try.... ugh. 
---
Find the one at Hemlock. I dare you...
---
Thanks for clarifying! I've come across a few bloodied weapons in my time but never gave them much thought, as the idea of running around with so little help is unappealing to my play style. That nurf didn't help my situation much either. 
---
I don't work about picking up scrap for lead. Camps sitting on a lead node 30 to 60 per hour. Have over 1400 scraps of lead in stash. Moving tomorrow to a acid node. Great way of keeping stock.
---
I‚Äôm fairly sure the only reason this is an issue for people is they‚Äôve been frustrated hunting for this spawn for a prolonged time, and player camps are an easy target to vent that frustration. 
---
Destroying the camp won‚Äôt spawn the vendor, nor will it send the message that this is a place that should not be camped. Unless you have a conversation and explain the situation, they might not even know about the random spawn mechanic in this game, let alone that they built on a highly trafficked farming spawn point. 
---
Level 15 or level 188, not everyone is part of an online community that highlights these locations.
---
I dont get these posts. Seriously. I played 12 hours yesterday didnt repair a thing. About an hour in today i had to repair 2 guns and 3 pieces of armor. I dont use white knight . Whoopppee doodaaa. The mats were so inconsequential i dont even know what it took to repair them. 
---
If its ballistic fiber, there are like 20 military camps. 100 caps and 30 minutes and you can get like 40 scraps. Thats weeks worth if repairs. 
---
You can go into nuke zones to fight the SBQ without PA. Just need to have 'rad sponge' equipped and be on a team that also has people sharing that perk. If you have a team of four and two are sharing rad sponge and two are sharing ghoulish, you never get rads and take little damage as long as your teammates are NEAR you. I've seen someone in the nuke zone totally naked just proving their point about rad sponge heh heh 
---
He hasn't found the long coat vendor yet because someone's camp was by the lake
---
U guys still try to play this ?
---
That Bobby pin reference made me do an actual LOL
---
That‚Äôs assuming I didn‚Äôt play through the game first. I duped after the fact.
---
It's an RPG, the end game is finding role for yourself: raider, traider, merc... complainer
---
Just started yesterday and I have a couple of questions.
---
-What weapons are the best weapons?
---
-Are military supply drops rare?
---
-What perk cards help out the most?
---
A lot of live-service games do actually update every week, even if it's something small, like changing the attack delay time on an ability. 
---
Didn't matter, you got out what you put in.
---
It‚Äôs not even trolling, and I‚Äôve never attacked people who say they enjoy the game. If you say you enjoy the game I never attack that statement. Cmon you should know this by now
---
Seems they intended the multiplayer element to carry the game, but few people even bother.  You barely run into people anyways because of the map size vs number of people individual servers can handle (and they can't handle the people already on them.  They crash and lag constantly)
---
Isn't that ONLY thing that you doing
---
I have no idea what it's worth but someone offered it for 5k last night and I didn't even dignify them with an answer, so that's way too much!
---
Aight so here is the screenshot comparison for all the smart ass people that are not owning actual armor parts but still smart enough to comment&amp;complain and downvote: -[https://imgur.com/MEyvcVg](https://imgur.com/MEyvcVg) marine
---
\-[https://imgur.com/23MWf5J](https://imgur.com/23MWf5J) leather
---
Now, I know that marine aint 200% but I cant repair it at this point (it can be only repaired while below 100%) BUT even on 200% it wouldnt have 50 ballistic dmg res. Not even talking bout almost 80 energy res. Get your facts straight.
---
More like marketing to make players think they will support the game for a long time.  I'm just wondering when they will start.
---
You have to go to your notes and read the plans to learn them. Maybe that's the issue. 
---
I really only play to explore the map and build up my camp. The really nice visuals (most of the time) coupled with great music makes it really pleasant and peaceful... Unless a scorchbeast comes out of nowhere and spams its sonic attack over and over. I just really enjoy customizing my camp and the option of placing it wherever I want, as well as customizing my weapons and armor too.
---
Let me help you:. They all died, very sad.  Don't have to read anything now.
---
Try moving your C.A.M.P unit into different locations within your camp. This might help with where you spawn
---
The best regular weapons are stuff Ike lever actions, handmades, Gatling guns
---
The best legendary weapons change from update to update
---
Military supply drops are actually called in by players so if you find one that‚Äôs pretty cool!
---
Perk cards that involve crafting are very helpful long term, combat ones are necessary all the time though, don‚Äôt be afraid to switch out cards in certain situations (lockpicking, crafting, even *eating*)
---
 I see you have not figured out what happened and why the people are all dead. 
---
Yoo, give me all that talk under my other comment with the screenshots on this post. 
---
&gt; Must be a newbie software developer.
---
I've been a developer for almost 2 decades. It is quite obvious they don't have many people working on this.
---
&gt; And what about their QA process?
---
What QA? They aren't even making unit tests for previously fixed bugs. Not only do they not have a lot of people working on it, they have serious structural issues in their process. 
---
I did I think it only gave me foundations? I thought o would just have a building? Or is it piece by piece?
---
And nuclear material and energy weapon stuff if you had scrapper
---
That's what Todd wants you to think.
---
Actually, when the vaults open  all their NPC residents will appear with a real kick ass storyline, ton of side quests, complex moral dilemmas and all that is due in a Fallout game. Bethesda's plan all the time was subverting expectations!
---
yes because 5 months is the same as 2 years.
---
I hope you're not suggesting that as an excuse. I don't believe people are going to give Bethesda 2 years to make 76 a good value.
---
In Fallout 76 it's all about knowing where to go on the map for a resource.  Then you end up with tons of it.
---
Your comments are not constructive, you are not helping anyone, and just baiting people, imho
---
I ran into this bullshit as well dude was hitting way to hard and to fast, the slap damage was like 15 how but his attack rate was so fast he was eating though my HP like a fat kid with potato chips.
---
Well then my seed is bad (lol, only barely aware of what I‚Äôm talking about) b/c my base luck is 14 and w/ unyielding it was 30 for 1/2 my maps...that‚Äôs why I listed my intelligence, figured that was why my drops were what they were
---
I found a bunch of good loot in one of the train station cigarette dispensers. I'm glad people leave their unwanted or unneeded goods for other people to use
---
30/45 in fo4 is pretty bad too, slow internet speed shouldn't effect your fps.  What's your CPU? Ram etc?
---
ESO was surprisingly good. Quite a bit of content. Seemed to be well supported. Obviously doesn‚Äôt feel exactly like the TES we were used to but it seemed like a good fit for the mmo vibe they were going for.
---
I guess the complexity of this game is tremendous. Balancing everything from gameplay to scrapping must be a champions challenge. Bethesda aimed high and wanted to create an epic game , kudos for their intentions, but the tweaking and balancing is ofc crucial and we've not yet played the final game. I've a lot of fun playing it as it is, looking forwards to future optimizations.
---
 Any time you clean a place out it takes a while for the stuff to reappear. This prevents server hopping for mass farming.
---
 You need a wider variety of sources you can farm so there's a decent amount time between visits.
---
woosh!
---
I won't be on for a few hours but would you pay 900 caps I believe that is a fair price considering the rarity.
---
I'm currently only about rank 32. I kinda feel like imat a stand still on my current missions. I have found that going to whitesprings means I get quickly destroyed by multiple creatures. I went by top of the world, and the scorched and mutants in that area were  ranked 40 and I couldn't kill them. I'm currently carrying a nice 44 with 50 damage and a shotgun with 106 damage. I can't seem to get better weapons to kill these beasts without... Well.. Killing these beasts.. (enemies) So I guess my question is, how can I get better weapons before I get to these areas,.. And which weapons do you think are best (so I know what to hang on to) any advise on this would be helpful. I feel kinda stuck at this point.. Too low ranked?? 
---
lol.  I'm glad it's not just me.
---
Be sure when you go to get the quest that you aren't wearing the armor. Toss it in the stash before you go in. The quest will just bug out and skip the part where it gives you the plans to make it.
---
People have been asking for this (among many other things) since the November BETA, don't expect this to get added any time soon.
---
I like how you realize that this may be the case yet you still whinged for a thousand words, and now you have started a trend of people exclaiming as if fact that there are only a handful of people working on the game
---
It's not a mystery.  Popping out of the vault, one of your first encounters are the Scorched at the farmstead close to the lumberyard - and then a town full of corpses.  Change the scorched to mutants, feral ghouls or robots - everything else is the same in every location.  Your only question from the beginning is:  Are they ghouls?  Why does everyone else look like they died a week ago?  
---
I'm picturing a skeleton crew where some members are actual interns. 
---
Where's the box at the junk yard? Charleston landfill
---
This makes no sense dude 
---
Well..... its obviously a trap. 
---
 You are burned out. Go ahead blame Bethesda, everyone does. ;)
---
Not on a rifle build. My shotgunner stays in PA
---
The hazmat suit would be way too OP if it were able to be worn with armor. Youd need a third option to make it viable. You have to give players a choice between what armor they need.
---
Example:
---
Hazmat has 1000 resistance to rads but gives no protection.
---
Power armor has protection from everything but with a cost with an always draining power supply.
---
The third option would be like a helmet or armor that would give unarmed players the freedom of the hazmat suit but you would need to have a cost at doing so, like -3 strength and -3 agility while wearing. So it would tone down your armor from barbarian and you would have less action points.
---
I believe you mean ‚Äúin a content expansion‚Äù. Unless I‚Äôm mistaken, nothing new besides nerfs has been introduced.
---
In agreement with others...the perks for armor and PA involving endurance, repair endurance, repair to 200%, repair with less materials etc....all encompassing, equals incredibly good effects. 
---
It's mind boggling that they didn't just port over the stairs from FO 4.
---
oh wow i didn't know that thanks
---
How is that pirate gameplay working out? I've looked at making a variant of that, but haven't tried it.
---
Yeah, it seems like scrapping is only for things that have no plans. I can back this up by poking around the esm file.
---
But not on Xbox and Ps. Just on PCs because they can.
---
You know, like I already explained. But when someone lets hate and rage guide them, reading comprehension is pretty crappy.
---
The only thing you seem able to hear is your own anger and ranting. 
---
I have seen them post-patch at SuperDuper and Grafton vendors.  It's purely RNG chance.  
---
the game of trolling is tough because as long as you keep responding I keep winning
---
IMO, Scrapper should *always* yield a new mod plan if one is available.  It seems to make so little difference otherwise.
---
Lvl 80+ here and J haven't struggled to find ballistic fiber in 20-30 levels....
---
I see your point. It would make more sense if we could only access this stuff because if our pipboys or something. But too little too late...
---
Actually I said in my post the reason for announcing is in Hope's Bethesda reads it and takes heed.  I didnt post so you your majesty can approve
---
We already have half walls, what we need are quarter walls. 
---
I think level advantages are also tied to your guns, for example if that shotgun you told me about is only level 5, it may be doing less damage than is listed to higher level enemies (DO NOT QUOTE ME ON THIS, ITS ONLY A HUNCH) focus on your perks too, my damage goes to shit when I forget to swap out my perk cards too. For shotguns I like the combat shotgun, for rifles I like the lever action, handmade if you want faster fire rate, lower damage. Everything is completely your preference though!
---
I hate it.
---
I'm of the opinion that they are trying to lose players now, they realized they fucked up and are trying to dwindle the player base down to a point where they can stop losing money on the servers and development team. 
---
What's your CPU/GPU usage look like?  Your pretty much using recommended specs aren't you?  Internet speed shouldn't effect fps.  FO76 actually runs slightly better than fo4 (if I uncap fps in it) for me.  Do other games perform as expected?
---
So make your own game and show them how to do it. 
---
There is no narrative.  The game is a honey-do list from the Overseer.  You can do sidequests for dead people and you read or listen to how they died.  You can do the quests or not, because nothing changes.
---
&gt; So tell me, what is the 'true' ending for Fallout 4?
---
I'd say the canon ending was likely joining the institute
---
I hate any Aoe mod or mutation. If you are near a friendly Robot and a mob hits you the Robots will all aggro you.
---
WS is the worst for that could not figure out why the robot kept going after me, then I realized it was the Grounded mutation.
---
If you‚Äôd like to level up more though, try events, especially ones you haven‚Äôt done before!
---
Randomly lost a deathclaw gauntlet today 
---
&gt; Edit 6: 3 silver and 2 gold? Really? Ok... *blush* Senpai's noticed me...
---
OP wtf. You type out this element post and cap it with *this*?
---
And a functional engaging game
---
If you're on XBox I can do all 5 BOS mods as well as 1 Enclave(better for Melee) or 1 BOS Underarmor(better for Gunner) Shielded lining for 1000caps+the requisite rare mats(the flux I dont have time to farm.)  
---
Sharing is just something else to do while we wait for content.
---
Other triple A companies do this too. It is just Bethesda that keeps disappointing.
---
I'm pretty sure I've played all the Events at this point, and I can honestly say that It's a Trap is the one Event I've *never* been able to finish.
---
The bigger question is, why do people that despise this game so much care if other people play it? Is your life so sad that you can‚Äôt play a different game, you have to spend you time telling people they shouldn‚Äôt be enjoying something they like to play? 
---
While I agree with all your points I still think dungeon raids can breathe life into this game. It could be a lot of fun. 
---
Why do you care? 
---
So clean you can't cook with it gave me a hearty chuckle.  +1
---
The post is old. The spreadsheet is current. The datamined ESM from patch 5 (and patch hotfix) shows no new plans or recipes added to the game, no new weapons, armors, weapon mods, or armor mods added, and the learn chances haven't changed.
---
The only think I can think of that might be confusing to some players is sometimes a player will be scrapping Combat Armor and learn "Brotherhood of Steel" (doesn't tell you which slot it applies to). That's actually the Combat Armor Helmet material mod. The Arms/Legs/Torso Brotherhood of Steel material mods can only be learned by plans. And now the plans no longer appear randomly at the Grafton Rail vendor.
---
All Deep Pocketed mods are Plan only with learn chance None, and all but one Pocketed are Plan only with learn chance none (you learn Marine Pocketed Arm/Leg/Torso from scrapping).
---
I'm not contesting your account / story, but what you saw/remember isn't really evidence. A video showing someone learning a learn chance "None" mod via scrapping would be good evidence. Who knows, maybe you aren't remembering quite right which armor type or mod it was, or maybe you hit some kind of really nice defect where you were able to learn something from scrapping that's not supposed to be possible. This is the only report I've ever seen of this happening, and we all know that the game has a huge amount of bugs, so who knows, you could have just hit a friendly bug.
---
In the future, I would suggest you choose your words more carefully. Declaring something "is flat-out not true" without and supporting text and especially without evidence on a public forum, is just unwise and potentially spreading misinformation. Here is a proposed alternative to what you originally posted: "I know it is not supposed to be possible, but I think this just happened to me (and share your story, and share that you have no other evidence)." I think that would have been much more constructive than your original reply. Agree?
---
&gt;I'll share your thread with the dev team
---
All four of them?
---
My go-to for hard enemies is still my semi-auto tse handmade - does about a hundred less dmg per bullet but so much faster fire rate. I usually just use my lever action for sniping and medium enemies at this point. 
---
As popular as it is, I really would still say the handmade is the best general gun for a rifleman build. Optimally, I would love to find an anti-armor explosive handmade with +50 dmg reduction while aiming. Sacrifice a bit of dmg over my current one but the armor penetration is great for higher tier enemies. Explosive still ignores armor quite a bit too, so outside of pvp I generally still like it across the board if using the explosive perks (+32% explosive dmg when it‚Äôs maxed out still, and don‚Äôt see much better). 
---
An instigating explosive 90%reduced weight lever action/hunting rifle would be great for sniping.  I like using my 10mm smg  and .38 auto combat rifle for variety and ammo‚Äôs sake too, so optimally an anti-armor - increased fire rate - faster reload for them would be good. Maybe explosive for the smg just because the recoil would be worse with the increased fire rate than it is already. 
---
Though really, a bloodied first attribute is probably better with all the guns if running a low health/nerd rage build (except maybe snipe where instigating nights still be better). I just usually don‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt want to be killed in a few shots by a band of mr. gutsys, but it would be effective. I‚Äôm tempted with the furious attribute as well, especially with the auto guns, but I just haven‚Äôt seen that much of a dmg increase with them. 
---
My two cents I guess - make sure you‚Äôre using bloodied mess and the perks for your weapon class (you probably are already, but why not mention it) and as much explosive perks as possible if using explosive (60% isn‚Äôt what it was, but still decent and grenades can be pretty deadly). I also pretty much never use vats and have low agi, but if that‚Äôs your thing you‚Äôd want to look into other stats instead. It can definitely be effective. 
---
I suppose I don‚Äôt have an answer for the best build ever, but it‚Äôs more fun to optimize whatever viable build you like the most anyway :). 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
I said this at launch and was told to just player Hunter/Hunted
---
Those are movies with scripts - if there was any semblance of a game mechanic that addressed the depressing situation other that chronic overeating, you might have a leg to stand on.
---
Thanks. I think the focus will be to rank up more via some events. I did powering up poseidon yesterday by myself and felt pretty accomplished. Lol thanks for the advice. 
---
Yeah its...not a great game. The two lanes are pointless and were probably tacked on because lanes added another google search keyword or some such. Unless someone is playing a deck based around moving between lanes - those decks arent good for the most part - most games take place entirely within one lane.
---
All the other mechanics were lazy copy/paste from hearthstone, including the idiocy of a 50 card deck (or now, optionally, 75) but with still only 3 card openers. It was a quick cash grab, proven when the contract with the original dev team literally ran out in year two and they spent 6 months changing developers. 
---
I've exited many times and I am certain my Stored is empty.
---
I have not yet tried moving my camp. I may just scout for a better location and try that. I really don't get the blueprint thing so I may just scrap the whole camp and start anew elsewhere.
---
fuck, i would have much rather preferred it was another DLC for FO4.
---
I love the map, and exploring everything and finding out what happened. but the MMO BS has killed it for me. 
---
It cant be that tough. Modders fixed many of the same bugs (which are carried over from previous games ex. Lever action rifle reload animation has been a bug since 4 and I heard NV) in only a little bit of time, if not within a few days and they aren't getting paid. 
---
saw one a month ago at a Nuked WS.
---
havent bothered with a nuke zone in weeks so not sure 100% if they still spawn, but they should.
---
Yeah just using Bethesda cause this is a fallout sub. Makes no sense how indie companies can be on top of their shit but billion dollar companies are full of excuses.
---
No problemo
---
The story is about finding out what happened to those that survived the bombs, discovering their attempt to create a vaccine and detecting/killing the scorched, and discovering where they came from and how/why it all failed and how you can be part of something bigger than yourself.  For me it is a compelling narrative and I like it that it is different from the usual game where you run to this or that quest giver and once you are done with them they have no further impact on the game.  There are a few characters in each in BGS gam ethat are more well developed and you can have more memorable interactions with, and in this game other players take on that role, at least for now.  My suspicion is may change at some point, but I don't really know.
---
Robot Armor that is 50% less dorky looking!
---
Lots of things need buffs. If they just buff that, then everyone needs to get a two shot explosive to kill quickly. 
---
‚ÄúBut my build is for the drill and it‚Äôs not good in pvp. I need guns nerfed down to drill strength so I can be best‚Äù
---

Near every single one is.

1) Corporate/Government/Head of the gang/head of the post apocalyptic hero group; has has ordered either automation or the destruction of the environment or other some dumb ass thing.
---
2) Either the info is someone doing that order or on the receiving end of that order.
---
3) They are all dead. Some died recently but that doesn't fucking matter.
---
The side things are all repeats of each other and aren't actually interesting at all.

Thanks! That was very helpful.

&gt;Consider your audience

Dude, no one likes you

I‚Äôve done 4 missile silos and 3 nuke zones without having to repair my x-01, PA is just hella durable in this game

&gt; *I have to say this is one of the best posts I have read here. Awesome that your friend is getting so much pleasure out of the game.*
---
How do you get that to 572 damage?
---
r/gamingcirclejerk is full of whiteknighting now tbh. 
---
I don't think I believe that the reason plans are missing from vendors is because they can't display everything. Watoga Phoenix has 3-4 times as many plans as any other vendor (because he has all the same CAMP plans and all the T-45/T-51b/T-60 power armor mod plans) and they ALL display. I don't know how to read vendor's levelled lists in xEdit, but someone that can should be able to easily confirm if the vendor's levelled lists post patch 5 are just missing these plans.
---
Map is definitely what‚Äôs keeping it going for me along with all the stories and lore there is to find. But yeah I would‚Äôve much preferred a new single player game centered around the responder brotherhood raider and enclave conflict.
---
I haven't played around too much with blue printing. But cant you make more than one blue print. Say have what you got there now in one print and then have the roof in a second print.? I believe you can have 5 or more blue prints. But I dont know if they each have their own budget or if its combined.
---
This is similar to an idea I posted about yesterday, where I suggested basically removing legendary drops from the game entirely and having legendary items all be player-crafted through Unique Mods.  Your take on it feels even more "lore friendly", I think.  Either way, I firming believe the legendary drop system needs to be thrown out and rebuilt. Not tweaked, not improved; *completely redesigned.*

I had this glitch happen with my sniper. It was great.

That's basically what was being proposed no?

Pfft..  welp. XD
---
Wow I was genuinely curious as I have no draw to the game and wanted to know somebody else‚Äôs opinion, wasn‚Äôt trying to be bm about it at all but I guess it poked you in the wrong place.
---
It‚Äôs very frustrating that one popped at 56 for me
---
Like before. I'm a melee build and I do good damage but I liked my tse weapons too. Now not so much. Maybe for swatting flies though
---
Ahhhh, the old "MoviePass tactic". Makes sense all things considering
---
Idk why you're getting downvotes, your concerns seem legitimate to me. I'm an application developer in healthcare. I also have friends I met back in college who are developers in other fields. I have never met a developer in person who would confidently claim the quickness of any change without real analysis. It's always tempting to say a simple integer change would be quick and easy, but you can never rely on that the code isn't a shit show. 
---
Just my humble two cents. 
---
You should read more books if you think this is good storytelling.  If the punchline is always: they died - no real need to worry.  System Shock 2 - now that was storytelling of a lonely wanderer - because people were alive - and then died before you could help them, but you really felt like you could have made a difference.  They had holotapes too, and it was way better.
---
Soooo human bits
---
Hilariously, they're actually in Rockville.
---
&gt;I intentionally leave myself things to do. I've bought Skyrim 5 times now and haven't completed the main story once. Yeah I know I'm weird. 
---
I actually do the same thing.  It's the whole reason I Lv. 103 and haven't even met MODUS.  It's not just that I have no interest in launching a nuke.  It's also because I want to leave some things unfinished.

Dear 10mm SMG front sight,

I appreciate your kind words.  I'm already feeling better after being away for a few hours.  I think I'll probably take some more time off and wait to see what they do with Adventure and Survival.  
---
Stupidest response to date.....
---
Just cause someone wants to criticize a game...
---
Doesn't mean they need to be a developer.
---
I agree....Make TSE Great Again!
---
The real question is, how come I can only do 500 damage, when my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet can do in excess of 5000 damage per hit.
---
I have mine on the island just south. Two industrial purifiers always unlocked, a food/adhesive farm open to all, a spare bedroom in the back, stash box, and all but a tinker's workbench. I wanted to create a safe place for wanderers in game. GT is the same as my username, so feel free to stop by anytime. :)
---
I reckon a couple of hundred thousand players already did it before me though.
---
I don't understand why this feature was removed from the game. Fast travel mats were a plan you could learn in the earliest BETA sessions, and they remain buildable in Workshops, but we can't have them in our camps anymore?  This is, IMO, one of *thee biggest* quality-of-life improvements that could make to the game.
---
Yeah, moving your CAMP module *kind of* helps if you're having issues spawning inside objects or the world, but it's not a real solution and it's guesswork at best.
---
Collect screws, build guns and scrap. There are a few that you can get RNG. 
---
Good luck, I just got the suppressor after my 40th scrap (400 screws)
---
Happened to me; i got griefed didn't know why. But i'm a role player not a munchkin so i won't whine to Beth.
---
Forgot to mention you can sometimes find the NV scopes at watoga
---
It's pretty clear after the first two towns:Everyone is dead - you're given no reason to think otherwise.
---
Aight, did it 2 minutes ago, [objectives never updated.](https://imgur.com/a/rXK4pF6)
---
You joke but they really should add NPC factions with each vault. Raiders, Gunners, etc. Not just for NPCs but new enemy types and AI. The game would be a lot better with enemy AI that uses tactics and is somewhat intelligeng. 
---
You're not ordinary though, you are still the one thats saves everyone else you just don't get to decide anything.
---
I'm a melee build and I can do good damage. They can just learn how to build up a character.  I did lol
---
On PS4 yesterday randomly found plans for marine torso armor near watoga at the NAR repair yard. They were sitting on the table in the shed with the armor bench. First time I ever saw them drop there. 
---
I have been really happy with their stuff to this point. 76 is meh and disappointment though.
---
My post was sarcastic my man, I know for a fact it's not tough to make changes like attack speeds, damage thresholds, durability rates etc. Anyone that thinks it is coming from a point of view where they have no programming experience of a larger system. Which isn't an issue until some of the people in this sub are being told by programmers that it's easy, and you see modders, as you say, fixing what we as players see as major issues in a matter of days for free, yet many of this subs users still deny the ease of fixing some of these issues.
---
I get my commie whacker buff before they can unnerf tse.
---
Everything in the atom shop is lacklustre. It would be cool if they put cosmetics in there that tied into the game world, but it‚Äôs kind of just random clothes. As for weapon skins, that would be cool. Maybe they could change the weapon models entirely, like changing the newer model of the assault rifle to something similar to the fallout 3 model.
---
Stimulate your Geiger counter.
---
5k?! how!?
---
It would probably be cheaper for Bethesda to negotiate with modders and pay them per-project for fixes/enhancements and then have their own programmers incorporate those into the game. The Bethesda Austin guys are new to the Creation Engine and it shows: they seem to be making only very slow progress and that comes at a cost of regressions and new defects. I think a significant portion of the Fallout modding community has substantially more experience and skill than the developers at Bethesda Austin, and it would probably be far cheaper and faster to get FO76 into a usable state by contracting with the top Fallout 4 modders to get things done quickly (and most likely more cheaply than having their own full-time employees plug away week after week making slow progress).
---
Polar bear.
---
I wouldn't yet. By summer it might be worthwhile.
---
The main studio did work on the game up until launch, where it was immediately handed over in full to the Austin studio, bugs and all.
---
I have like 120 cores from characters I made early in the game. I haven‚Äôt seen a single core in the wild in like 2 weeks
---
um ok.
---
oh, huh, my bad
---
I solo him with melee every time it pops up since level 37 (i think was the first time I tried).
---
All the players are vaccinated - they don't need to be saved.
---
No, I'm in at the moment.
---
ok there was a old bug that maybe back (thx Beth). Sometimes if a character gets the Carnivore or herbivore mutation, you could not get any other mutations.
---
Game is designed to make them mutually exclusive, so you cannot have both C and H, but the code was bad and they sometimes on some characters results in preventing ANY other mutations. even serums wont work.
---
I recommend you cure the carnivore and then try farming the mutations again.  Just my thoughts.
---
Everyones saying that, but I don't like that people are hyping it as the next fallout. It's not, its a new separate game, and I don't want it to get over hyped and cause mass dissapointment that it doesnt live up to fallout and have an amazing looking game get torn apart in reviews do to it not living up to the comparison with reviews like 'The outer lands is not the new fallout we were promised' ect. Everyone needs to manage there expectations for this game.
---
Hey and while we're at it, how about when ranged weapons fire passes through enemies without dealing any damage?
---
The disease that turns them into scorched still exists. Diseases spread and it would destroy the wasteland if not stopped.
---
Honestly bro don‚Äôt. Unless you get a dirt cheap one, you‚Äôll regret any amount you spend. Try apex legends out tho it‚Äôs f2p and is actually fun 
---
I disagree.  What do you save?  A person?  Everyone is dead.  Appalachia?  No, because there's always another Scorchbeast Queen where the last one came from.  At best, you're fighting to contain a problem, not stopping it outright like you would in any other Fallout.
---
This is the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever read
---
Found marine armor arms plan at Fort Defiance 4th floor, in the room with PA stations.
---
I was thinking of that but man its takes so many screws and that's the one item that I always seem to be in short supply of.  
---
I swear I scrapped hundreds of hunting rifles but still cant get the .38 receiver. only one I have left to unlock.
---
This really needs more attention. I was having the most random crashes in the game. I had forgotten I turned off my page file a while back, but I didn't even stop to think an engine as old as Fallout 76's would require the page file.
---
Setting the page file back on and double my physical RAM fixed my crashes. Thank you so much!
---
So you have to shoot something 2 or 3 times instead of 1 shotting everything. The game is unplayable !!!!
---
If I'm hungry, and you sling me a shit sandwich - I'm not going to eat it - and I shouldn't be grateful you offered it.  You don't help dead people, they're dead - you bury them, loot them, and move-on.  Oh wait, after all th see heartbreaking stories, I'm just going to leave them to rot, after I rifle through their homes and pants.
---
Feel better? Good. Have a cookie. 
---
Awesome idea. Hopefully u/Ladydevann, u/LoneValutWanderer, or u/kindofsquishy can pass this on to the dev team for a future update.
---
I was able to connect with my secondary character but my main character was getting a server timing out error. 
---
This was patched back on Jan10th patch I believe.  My fusion cores do not refill when logging out anymore. 
---
That's what happens about 80% of the time I'd say. I think I'm super lucky even to get to the point I killed the SB, just not lucky enough to stay in server üôÑ
---
&gt; I fail to see how this system would be bad for FO76
---
PVE is analogue and so is PVP. PVX is next level gaming. You're supposed to step up your game; care about potential, new things, novelty. 
---
Complex = fun?
---
Why is basic, simple, analogue, and to me boring fun to you?
---
This explains so much
---
Guys, keep it down!! Bethesda might take note and ‚Äúbalance‚Äù it.
---
Am I crazy or did one of you really just delete the reply I wrote? 
---
Wow.
---
When there are 4 posts in under 24 hours saying the same thing, all on the front page of the subreddit, that‚Äôs whining to me.
---
Ah, see I'm not attuned to catching sarcasm through text, and legitimately see those kinds of arguments. Its just idiotic. 
---
We need this on the front page. This is one of the best and fresh ideas I've seen in a while!
---
We also need a (legal) way to consent to Bethesda using our ideas. Like a little contract or phrase you can add to each "please do this" post.
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but in theory every time someone suggests an idea publicly BEFORE a game studio ever puts it on paper themselves... you could technically sue the develper for using your intellectual property (IP) without your consent. Is that then, why more of our ideas are not used?
---
I posted one of my own ideas not long ago and included a little "I give BGS my consent to use this intellectual property". Half serious, half as a joke. But would that make your IP fair game?
---
Well, I was meaning in general, across the entire franchise for the terminal and notes thing. As mentioned in the other comment. FO4 was especially interesting on the exploration lore. It does apply to 76 as well, but yeah. As you said, majority of it follows that same theme. With a few exceptions, like some stuff about the bombs dropping and it appearing like neither the USA or Chinese dropped the first one.
---
I love the game
---
They only get to work on the game after they get off work at McDonald‚Äôs ü§ó
---
It doesn't just plonk down a warehouse. You now have the additional wall building options etc, just like building with wooden walls
---
I deleted the game. No fux given
---
Were they standing still while you were shooting them?
---
It was in the BETA,  it sure why they didn‚Äôt keep it. 
---
Absolutely.  We need a static environment because a dynamic one is too hard: it requires hardwork, planning, and effort!  Kill'em all, let the holotapes sort it out.
---
üëç
---
Ive seen maybe one or two at bog workshop. Well near it.
---
If I told everyone my secrets it would probably get nerfed ._.
---
So you‚Äôre a melee build and complaining that you can‚Äôt do crazy damage with a gun? If you specced for the gun that had TSE, maybe it wouldn‚Äôt suck so bad for you. 
---
I‚Äôd rather they buff all guns‚Äô base damage, not just the TSE stat.
---
I've known plenty of Dark Souls streamers who don't know it's 6 player. To me when i pick up a video game case it's the 3rd thing i notice - how many players. You seriously didn't know PVP was a thing, now you're mad? LOL
---
I was confused about Anthem, still am - how does it NOT have PVP? Madness.
---
Anyways mature role players organize on reddit rather than grief randoms. I organize workshop PVP on PS4 every sunday you should give it a chance. It's 100X more fun than mindless grinding.
---
&gt;That's fucking gold.
---
Well you do have the tools to make it so...
---
Agreed.  There is no binding gameplay that unites the dwellers in any fashion whatsoever.  So many wasted opportunities.
---
Peices. 
---
Yes providing different models for each weapon would be great (again like what cod wwii offers), but that could be a lot of work. Simply changing the skin/texture map is really minimum amount work for great rewards. Someone starts fresh might want to dress up his beloved pipe pistol, and later on when he levels up he will personalize his revolver and 10mm. The personality will follow the player and so will the game economy. Right now i have thousands of atoms at level 200+, I don‚Äôt even know where to spend them. The only two skins for weapons are minigun and fatman, I hardly ever use those so why bother. 
---
[No.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=10&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiyhMCYlq_gAhXPHjQIHc2HCREQFjAJegQIBxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamerevolution.com%2Ffeatures%2F349361-toxic-gamer-culture-causes-game-developers-stay-quiet-says-dev&amp;usg=AOvVaw1XeHR-G0uvBRkKdGdnbKHW)
---
I am enjoying the game for what it is aside from the exploiters and the odd cheater/griefer asshole.
---
Oh, so we‚Äôre doing a circle-jerk thread?  Good to know.
---
I already played a lot of apex legends,almost lvl 30 there but it‚Äôs a complete different genre
---
they were moving around the claiming circle of my workshop.
---
&gt;I'm not posting for attention or to complain. I sincerely want you (bethesda) to either get your asses in gear and fix the game and commit to it, or abandon it,
---
Sure mate !!
---
The Grounded mutation is not affected by the Class Freak perk. It shows the proper 12% energy damage reduction with rank 3 but applies the full 50% damage reduction to energy weapons.
---
Don't attribute to laziness which can adequately be explained by intentional corporate cost-cutting.  Like the patch notes and patch team.
---
I have only seen 1. And he was already dead.
---
Of course; that's why you use reddit to organize next level gaming. Do you really not have any imagination for what you'd do with 25 players?
---
It could be Dead By Daylight or Dark Souls. Step up if you play it like F04 of course you'll be bored.
---
I paid 35 dollars for this game like 2 weeks after it came out... And I regret my decision still
---
Could of had sentinel armour which reduces the affect of player attacks. 
---
Because I'd like the choice to be either PvE or PvPvE (which is kinda common at the moment, and really doesn't change a whole lot)
---
And I don't care for PvP, so why force me and others like me to participate in that part of the game, when it's only going to be fun for the people who decide to force us into it?
---
It's not any more complex when you add enemy players in, it's just another potential target. I'm sorry if I don't want to min-max for PvP, or use the meta builds, just so I stand a chance in a mode I don't want to play, but I'd rather have fun with my freedom.
---
Totally agree with you. I don‚Äôt think the game can‚Äôt be turned around. I really hope they make it the success the franchise deserves. 
---
Apparently the roadmap does exist and the art and dev team are still working on it. Got a few small details out of one of the other CMs in a thread i posted yesterday, check my post history
---
20 duped melee bobbleheads lol
---
Categoricshoe47 
---
Thanks. 
---
I have been noticing my damage dropping alot for no apparent reason. Ill try uninstall and reinstall perk cards see if that helps.
---
Woah, hey, the French robot wanted to know Hugo's fate and make sure she didn't fuck up real huge. She does say "he may still be out there", but the point was you bring his nanny not peace of mind that the kid made it into a vault after all.
---
Otherwise a lot of the quests are completing research to help **you** in your fight against the scorched, so that perhaps one day everyone's not always dead in Appalachia
---
Thanks for your input! Unfortunately, this can't be it either because I have tried this. I've been free of any mutations every time I've tried something new. 
---
Funny thing is when you go and meet Rose and she says something like "I bet you didn't expect this did you"... Um yeh I did haha
---
I'm really pissed off about the queen dropping rusty knuckles and explosive vents all the time. I killed her 10 times then lost count after that.  She is the only way to get ultracite calibrated shocks and she has never once dropped them for me. 
---
This type of  RNG bullshit shouldn't apply to the queen.  Not saying you have to get calibrated shocks on your first try. but 20 times without seeing them once is ridiculous. 
---
Don't lecture me about how you can pay someone else who has plans   to build them for you.
---
Is this an RPG or not? 
---
What if I want to role play as a power armor craftsman? 
---
Is role playing dictating by RNG too? 
---
 Role playing opportunities in this game are limited at best, but things like this make them literally non-existent. 
---
I would say either the whitespring train vendor or the resort vendors. Possibly Watoga but I'm not 100% sure
---
I read this forum daily and this is the one of the few well thought out critiques. Not like they'd change this but it shows how petty the other QoL stuff is.
---
I do a lot of solo exploration. So a good go to for me was Rifleman and melee build. Except I didn‚Äôt put any points into melee damage perks, focusing on weight reduction instead. Gotta get that aluminum.
---
‚Ä¶..his health didn't budge...and then he one shots me I am in a upgrade T-51 power armor suit.....
---
FO4 didn‚Äôt have every item and enemy infinitely respawn.  There was built-in scarcity since it would take a very long time, unlike FO76 where you‚Äôre swimming in weapons to scrap.
---
[Yep.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-l6tHeseDY)
---
I thought cards dont stack... i.e. you can only have one active card of the same type?
---
I‚Äôve got a couple. 
---
My main is a survivalist build that takes minimal rads and collects as much extra meat/vegetables as possible. Weapons are pretty much whatever he can get. He was a history professor that advised the military prior to the war, and saw everything coming so became a survivalist. He used his time in the vault to improve all the relevant skills, and is living high on the hog in the wasteland. 
---
My alt is someone who was born in the vault, and never took seriously the fact that one day he would be forced to leave. He is completely naive about how to survive, so is constantly taking rads from eating uncooked food and drinking creek water. (In a few more levels, he‚Äôs going to discover chems and become addicted so as to escape this new reality). 
---
I pick up cores off the power armor spawns in the world, the chassis has a core, but I just loot it I don't claim it.  If you are in Watoga there are a couple PA spawns that aren't too far from pheonix, just go north the is one on the ground, then one on top of a building where a vertibird is crashed. 
---
You can think that if you want, but my goal here is prevent you from trolling others
---
I can one shot anything with my melee why can't they one shot with a gun?
---
Could be lag. I have this happen and have to use VATS to hit anything sometimes.
---
&gt;Because I'd like the choice to be either PvE or PvPvE
---
You did when you bought the 76 instead of Fo4. Why should i bother to read the rest of your post when you're this intensely literal. Welcome to reality.
---
under the bed
---
lol, they don't stack, at least not anymore. The explosive perk was the last to be unstacked, in the latest patch. Now you can only have one bobblehead and one mag active at any one time.
---
Just wondering if you ever got it because I just got in the same situation and I‚Äôm at level 102 and it‚Äôs my last trophy
---
That's a relief.
---
I use blueprints for things that I build in workshops I take. Tower with turrets.  Extractor and generator and walls. Things like that you wanna not have to do manually over and over.
---
Was built for it. Could one shot anything. Now I can one hit anything with melee. My melee does more damage now then a tse could ever do currently. It's a two shot explosive weapon. It's supposed to do insane damage. 
---
Or I‚Äôll just wear t60 power armor and not do all of that
---
Congrats, my level 100 trophy is glitched I‚Äôm at level 101 and it hasn‚Äôt popped what level were you when it popped
---
Kind of the same with getting fusion cores... Don't want to power up a power plant? Take the workshop and drop in a fusion generator next to the fusion core generator.... Works like a champ. 
---
Finally this subs posts about this game have caught up to r/fallout
---
‚Ä¶.that was insane tho 250 rounds and half a handmade drum mag later and nothing and then I die with one hit from a sledgehammer in a fully upgraded T-51 suit....jesus 
---
Remove all legendary drops. Remove game from servers. Remake game in Unreal Engine. Re-upload game to servers. Make money
---
Prevent it from happening again to who?
---
Can we mount one of its arms to my power armor, the cod piece maybe? That would make my day, pew pew.
---
You are a Bethesda Employee. That's obvious from your post.
---
Burned out ? 
---
That's You 
---
I've said it before but there is no story. Just a bunch of lore laying around that you can follow.
---
I think he's refrencing a joke from "The Office" about declaring bankruptcy.
---
My character is an extremely confused Raider suffering from extreme radiation exposure, who likes to shoot peoples turrets then give them materials to repair them. Likes to get a bounty and kill bounty hunters. Likes to give low levels with bounties weapons and armor. She wants to destroy everything and kill everyone, but when it comes to it she just wants to be nice to them, unless they try to kill her, then she flips psycho in a heartbeat and eats them.
---
We need NPCs! 
---
Same and it's really frustrating when its an ammo sponge like a SB and everything I shoot misses.  
---
Hahaha commie whacker is just for fun. Do a one handed weapons build and there ya go
---
Well, there USED to be a point to "feeding the people".
---
This question seemed more about the value of his money. I think apex is better value for free than 76 is for any price 
---
thx. almost wasted 3k caps on plan. to check if I can swap back from prime receiver on my .50 cal MG
---
I hope so.  It's so frustrating because it's a legitimately simple addition. They have so many variants of other items, yet variants that make sense got overlooked entirely. Even the Red Rocket Garage door they *sold* in the Atom shop only has the one Warehouse variant.  
---
Rather than spending 2 weeks doing this why not go about adventuring, sell crap and buy ballistic fibre
---
Because I wanted to play a fallout game with friends? Or meet new friends with similar interests?
---
Why should I give any thought at all to your argument if you refuse to even read mine? 
---
Clearly you're too set in your ways to ever change your mind, but may I ask how any of my suggestion actually affects your gameplay experience?
---
100% agree. This, or some sort of system that lets us strip the modifiers from Legendaries and apply them to other weapons/armour. I wouldn't be able to put this game down, the grind would be so rewarding!
---
There is a 1-hour cool time after getting a mutation for another to occur. I would try server hopping.
---
A lot of people have left the game because they can't one shot every enemy? Don't people like a challenge anymore? 
---
The easiest i have found is to drink dirty water.
---
Note that you can only get 1 per server secession, so after you get 1 log out to the desktop and log back in.
---
Ah yes aluminium the pain to my mains existence  lol
---
Damn right! Always consider your options!!
---
My first lever action that I found is a level 50 suppressed hardened rifle it's one of my main guns still
---
I‚Äôve been saying this since the beta. The day Fo76 launched, the majority of the team moved on to Elder Scrolls V and StarField. They might have planned to move some resources back on Fo76 for future updates and content drops, but I think after all they‚Äôve been through, Bethesda is just going to let this one die quietly.
---
...So no, you didn't pay any attention to the story.
---
I find it depends on how my gameplay is going at the time. If I‚Äôm just ‚Äúplaying‚Äù then I get to the point where I actually start selling screws as I have too many.
---
As soon as I start helping out other people and crafting weapons/ armor for them, plus modding, they seem to disappear almost instantly.
---
I have carnivore and added more mutations with serums.
---
I've tried that, I moved in inside and in different spots 6/10 times I somehow spawn glitched. 
---
The pipe rifles are about at marine corps specs. IRL anyway
---
No. Playing F76 atm 
---
Bro this is awesome.
---
I almost exploded someone's base yesterday with one of those satellites. I was debating for a good 5 min.
---
If I do shoot turrets I'll give some supplies, like of it's at whitesprings. Blah stupid whitesprings houses.
---
Ahhh cannabalism  one of the best perks.
---
They are looking into that. How ever issue is more the lack of ability to farm those items.  More of those items in a container or faster respawns on over world would allow easier farming. 
---
Have Bethesda every considered the solution might be adding rather than taking away? 
---
Like if I thought my wife was cheating on my the solution wouldn‚Äôt be, maybe she should spend more time with the suspiciously well hung pool boy.
---
Play something else until there‚Äôs an actual effort made, on the devs part, to fix this flaming turd. 
---
i'm now using 
---
iLargeTextureArrayMipSkip=1
---
iTextureMipSkipBC1UNormSrgb=1
---
iTextureMipSkipBC3UNormSrgb=1
---
iTextureMipSkipBC1UNorm=1

iLargeTextureArrayDim=1024
---

---
and insteadd of RivaTuner fps cap i remove ALL vsync then just use s-sync in rivatuner with a value = "-180 "
---
ridiculously smooth everywhere now
---
I saw your post and I chuckled to myself. You don't need an art department to get this done it's just more stalling for time. Sure, it might look neat and Fallout-like but the community is crying out for something, anything, and instead Bethesda are having an art department come up with something. There was nothing new in the response with it being a slightly expanded version of "they're working on it". I'll believe the roadmap exists when I see it, not before.
---
so how tf then lmao
---
They were in the BETA...
---
Right, but those are drive by script and character motivations.
---
Games are driven by script, character, and player motivation. What's the point in taking the most interactive story medium and turning into ,"go do that thing because we decided you should". It's lazy and uses arbitrary objective fulfilment rather than plothooks and story beats to build the story.
---
Soon to be followed by legendary pumpkin pie. Always looks pretty but never gets old. Still tastes like crap.
---
Haha, glad you had a chuckle ü§™
---
I've looked and they are still in the list, I don't mean to suggests it's the only factor, but when replicating the effect in FO4 they vendors hit a cap
---
‚ÄúCould one shot anything‚Äù. And you don‚Äôt see a problem with that? Not everything should be killed in one shot.
---
And ya it should do good damage, but it shouldn‚Äôt do so much that it outranks any other weapon so much. Why should a TSE rifle do more damage than a fat man? Or even a middle launcher?
---
To any that stumble upon this thread later: the Church in Sutton, VERY close to the Overseer's camp, is the best place immediately outside the vault to snag these.
---
Constant +45% aoe damage, seems pretty good to me.
---

---
I'm a paladin, heavy weapons (energy mostly they will be good one day!... I hope) and teamedic support. Just wish there was more team driven content so I can help a team.
---
Love the backstory, I should do this.
---
My main is a solo gal that helps when she can. She wants to be sneaky but can make noise when she wants.
---
My alt likes to talk and takes things close range.
---
What can I say? ü§™
---
And then legendary perks become useless and there is literally no reason to play the game after you beat the story mode. 
---
At the end of the day some people just need something to bitch about lol. I agree with you that people seem to be like ‚Äúeveryone says this game has issues but surely this copy won‚Äôt have this issues...‚Äù then act surprised when it does. It‚Äôs like watching someone getting electrocuted pissing on an electric fence laughing at them then pissing on the same fence and getting pissed off when it electrocutes you. But if I‚Äôve learned anything in life it‚Äôs that people are generally masochists and intentionally make it hard on themselves for the purpose to bitch about it. Trying to find sense in it will make you go just as bat shit crazy as them. Lmao

"Hereditary Addiction Predisposition" is the most depressing "Perk" i can imagine but there you go for brainstorming.
---
Maybe it should be a mutation instead "Slow Metabolism."
---
Drugs should balance mutations - might be funny to do junkies vs muties. Chameleon - use purple mentats to see them, lots of psycho for damage resist, share perks to run fast, only need 1 chemist in the group handing out candy.
---
A perk to share drug effects would be amazing too but you can get some distance out of sharing group medikits. So more like Lucky muties vs Charismatic junkies.
---
I've been struggling with making my gunslinger strong but i think opting out of mutations might be the trick. Go herbivore and you can get +20% crit off of firecracker berry juice, add bio-comm mesh, get a system together for best drugs to take and a timer to monitor them.
---
That's a lot of work and just running fast Speed Demon is probably more efficient in the.... long run.
---
For my armor, for instance, it is taking 6 ballistic fiber and 6 screws to repair each piece. I've read some comments saying it only takes 2 ballistic fiber. That isnt my experience, and I have white knight maxed out of course.
---
Lolol ok thank u at least I kno I didn't just waste 460 caps
---
Excellent idea. The top modders have proven time and time again that they are more than competent and in some respects even more competent than certain sections of the dev team when it comes to fixing issues and implementing solutions to problems the community bring up. It took a modder barely a week of work to create a fully functioning in game text chat overlay. This is a person sitting in the room of their home doing this in a minimal amount of time. So one has to ask why Bethesda/Austin is seemingly incapable of doing the same. Has to be inexperience with the engine because surely the workload is not that absurd given the tentative nature and minimal content of the updates we've had so far. A dev studio like CD Projekt Red and even "indie" studios like Larian have put out more work in a two week update for games such as Witcher 3 and Divinity OS 2 than Bethesda has managed in over 3 months so there really is no excuse. What is going on with the development of this game? And if modders have proven to be able to put out fixes and improvements faster and more efficiently than the devs themselves of course it makes more sense for Bethesda to involve them like you said. It might even be necessary to do so. But of course they won't. 
---
This this this this THIS!
---
I really like the idea of heavy weapons. They are really cool but not exceptional here.
---
Yeah I'm hoping charisma is going to get better since that's what I'm hoping on.
---
I haven't put a sight on mine yet, just the large bayonet. I turned it into a big-ass drill.
---
I like this idea, they could be new events. On the map the orange hexagon could start empty and fill in with colour as it got closer to triggering the boss. Would definitely help in bringing players together.
---
Missed the boat, buddy, it's already considered the great savior of open world rpg's everywhere (and it's not even open world!)
---
holy shit, i thought my tse lever action that does 268 that i got recently was good...
---
I know what you mean.  I experimented with a large viewing area in my camp using a garage door and it just looked awful from the outside with the metal walls that I use.
---
Never rand into invisible enemies. Had a team mate go invisible once or twice but never enemies. 
---
\&gt;  Hey and while we're at it, how about when ranged weapons fire passes through enemies without dealing any damage? 
---
That is server lag. Something that will always happen with online games unfortunately. 
---
I‚Äôd like my camp to have a bomb shelter.. 
---
Do you have the exact number of materials? Like if you need 5 springs do you have exactly 5 springs. Also try putting all your junk or those items in your stash. I run into this problem with everything. Its usually because i have the exact amount of an item but when i get 1 more of that item i can craft/repair.
---
the abandoned waste dump so i could make friends with the deathclaws
---
they might but given the lack of dedicated servers and player limit per server, they're doing a pretty shit job of it.
---
Because Bethesda thought they would have an easier time making their first ever multiplayer game with a shared world if there were no real NPCs, so they thought up some shitty excuse about about nuclear zomies as to why everyone's dead?
---
Purified water too good for my corn soup
---
I know how dare the game not allow me to be a walking god that wipes everything in 1 shot. Then I run to the forums and claim I'm bored and it is all Bethesda's fault they can't keep me interested in it. 
---
nope, only the throwing knifes.
---
But on that note, Tomahawks can only be found.
---
Apparently a pack of five will rarely spawn in Clarksburg. I‚Äôve never seen it myself but others have posted video here. 
---
I never got this, even high level legendary gutsys never bothered me. L
---
More like 3 hours over 2 weeks of playtime. Which is maybe 25 minutes per play session. Almost as much time as I spent trying to find the perfect place for that portable toilet, or all the times I mined Lucky Hole and then stared into the abyss of the dead cultists‚Äô eye-holes.
---
I was thinking about it after posting, what do you think about an egghead perk, one int at the expense of -1 in everything else to a max of 10. That gives you 25 base in INT and 5 max in everything else making you super squishy but you can then build anything and over repair everything.
---
I do kind of like the idea of like Krang from TMNT, we have a special suit of PA that makes us near invincible for exploring but limited offensively.
---
My wife and I are on XBOX and have the same thing happening, I just posted about it a few minutes ago. Fast travel doesn't cure it and sometimes one person quitting and coming back doesn't fix it. Very frustrating especially when you are playing with 6 to 8 people. 
---
I would like to know a certain area, or a certain event, or a certain enemy, that will have a high chance of dropping a certain item. So for instance I don't care that loot is total RNG. I just need to know if I kill legendary enemies in this particular area, or particular specific legendary enemy type anywhere, or a certain event, then I have a high chance of getting Heavy Combat Armor up to 3 stars with the change to get the RNG I want to find. Or maybe I want Heavy Raider armor. Or maybe I want Marine. Etc. 
---
So for example I want 3 star Heavy Combat Armor with my specific favored RNG stats, so I can kill legendary mobs in Watoga for an increased chance, or I can kill legendary super mutants, or I can farm a specific event, etc. We need to have some way to get the exact type of items we want, so it's not all completely RNG. So maybe Legendary Super Mutants in Watoga have a high chance of dropping 3 star Heavy Combat Armor, for example. 
---
Maybe this kind of system already exists but nobody knows about it. I don't know. But I need to know what to farm to get the things I want. The whole thing being a complete RNG lottery is very detrimental to me.
---
Who would buy that, marketing boi, it is from iguana, mutated tasty iguana.
---
god a video proof of you one shot killing a Mirelurk Queen (level 50) with melee?
---
I've always moved my camp module away from my camp then never had issues.
---
 I was close myself. Endless farming and I decided to change my play-style. Now I walk everywhere and its really a much better game like that.
---
 From your post you are obviously burned out.
---
Why does this feel like a way to try and play up Fallout 76?
---
Cannabls  lol
---
Same here
---
If you‚Äôre really interested, it‚Äôs easy enough to find.
---
Pretty much agree.  Bethesda has moved into the "EA" bucket when it comes to me buying products they sell now.  As a consumer I've moved on to something better for my money.  Too many options to remain loyal to a publisher that pulls this kind of crap.
---
I would be happy with 4-6 shots honestly right now it's like 10-12 head shots or even worse my minigun that's like 750 rounds. Sigh I hope heavy weapons get fixed soon.
---
Well, not or maybe could, related. 
---
Just on last session, on end parts of  it, I noticed how my weapon damage, all of them, were closer to pre nerf. (TS and explosive weapons, only had TSE post nerf so I don't know about that) Some enemies also seemed to not take all damage.
---
I think somehow my mutation that increases damage when Im lower health, glitched, and it's effect became permanent. Probably rad worms were involved as it's glitched too.
---
&gt;dirty and unfair exploit.
---
Unfair to whom? Anyway it's not exploit if server does something. Exploit is abusing a glitch, making it happen.
---
If that is the reason then if they played an actual survival game their heads would explode from rage. I honestly want to force every player who left because they can't one shot every enemy to be forced to play 3 hours of Ark Survival Evolved.   
---
I want to watch their heads explode as raptors kill them for the 12th time because all they have are pointy sticks. 
---
I just closed my eyes and tried to pretend rosie was a real, interesting person instead of yet another goddamn Mr. Handy. Her voice acting is great, it's a real shame.
---
They are great.  I'm only lvl 42 and picked up a lvl 35 one a while back has a medium scope and long barrel. I like it so much that I went out and bought the plans. Just need mod plans now to go with the gun. 
---
Didn't they "fix" the core generation recently tho? Thunder Mountain generates cores much more slowly for me 
---
Are those the nice clean red ones? If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can build you some
---
I can 1 shot stuff in the forest region. Its pretty fun but the loot stinks. They should have low levels drop high lvl gear. Problem solved!
---
This. I keep being fast travelled into water, taking rads while I wait for assets to load. I built a new platform above the water level where I though I‚Äôd spawn but now I‚Äôm dropped further away, in deeper water ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
However star field turns out.. whoever gets it, I hope they enjoy everything that comes with it. They deserve it. 
---
Never good enough news with 76. It‚Äôs never good news. You spend hours or supposed to and it‚Äôs empty there is nothing in this. 
---
I hope the game about space has more content going on for those who purchase I can‚Äôt see myself after this and fo4. Fo4 I only got cus of New Vegas and 3. Bethesda blew all their credibility. There is no one looking at star field if it‚Äôs all going to be the same. 
---
Going on 26 turn ins, both single, double and 3+ and still nothing but the caps, water and ammo. This is getting more tedious than belly of the beast when I kept dying. Lol
---
Adding a second perk level would be nice to get more items like screws and springs and ballistic fiber from armors that would require it to be build. 
---
And the solution is to nuke everything, which would realistically do what?
---
Everyone guess.
---
Destroy the wasteland. Hell, half the country, probably.
---
Negative. It's not passive mode it's being on a team, or picking up the mic. 99% of the stuff you guys post about can be fixed with a team; like perk cards.
---
One in the same. We're talking about the same containers. 
---
I only use it when I'm out of steel to.keep feeding my ammo crafting.
---
My bloodied built. I could do that. Not worth proving. It's a discussion. Not a show and tell
---
Food +60%, bobblehead and mag +40%, mutations +70% and adrenal reaction buff, perks +60% to +100% depending on weapon and +8 to 10 str, bloodied with adrenal reaction massive increase in which all buff effects add up to ten fold damage at low health, unyielding armor set +15 to str, alcohol +6 str or so, psychotats/buff +25% and +3 str.
---
Not if they don't fix the graphics engine and upgrade it properly.  If they go the "cheap and easy" route they will totally screw up TES:VI big time.  Not holding my breath at this point and will never pre-order from them again.  (Common theme with most publishers now for me)
---
&gt;Why should I give any thought at all to your argument if you refuse to even read mine? 
---
Because i'm a philosopher who can tell you being as literal as a Creationist is a dead end.
---
I really wish they didn't tell us.
---
Story wise, you only nuke the fissure sites. Game wise, yes players nuke everything.
---
Can we please address the fact that I cannot scrap ammo... 
---
That's not fair - they did grab some code from Skyrim for the "Dragon"..  I mean Scorchbeast.  So they used at least one other person in another studio.  :)
---
Yes, yes you do.
---
And it would likely be better than anything they could come up with. By that I mean that the mystery itself is more exciting that knowing the story. I'm reminded of the lore of Five Nights at Freddy's and Binding of Issac where there are loose clues but nothing definitive (at least last I heard) and the fans went nuts with all kinds of speculation that was fun and creative. Sometimes not knowing is better.
---
just curious i'm old and outta the loop who is this felicia i see everyone saying bye to
---
Find someone you can dunk on in pvp. Down them, revive them, down them, revive them, accidentally kill them then consume their flesh you cannibal
---
Nah bro they are vaccinated. That is what stops diseases.
---
No. It's arguably worse than at release.
---
I don‚Äôt know. What is a negweg? I can tell you what Newegg is. It‚Äôs a popular online retailer. 
---
It stops the players from being infected but not the entire wasteland
---
Can i get a couple flechette mods, please? PSNid Enterres
---
Seems pretty strange that all of your friends had at least a two shot explosive weapons... i think a lot of you don't even gained those weapons
---
Welcome to Bethesda. 
---
I have 15 charisma, I should be able to share multiple cards if I have the charisma for it. Rad sponge and goulish for example level 3 ghoulish is 9 points of charisma and a level 1 rad sponge for another 3 points for total of 12 or a few smaller card.
---
I'm not trying to brag or come off like a douche but I've been playing since launch and haven't experienced (knock on wood) a fraction of the problems people complain about. I play on a PC so maybe that's the difference. I honestly feel bad for people who have these struggles and can't enjoy the game. 
---
This will work? 
---
What level we're you when you first took down a sbq? Also how many people were in the battle? I'm a level 45 and just got recently got the quest "I am become death". I ask the first question b/c I don't want to be that guy who pops off a few shots and let's everyone else take her down while I stand back. I am also curious if this is something I could I complete with a couple other people rather than the suggested 8+.
---
You are absolutely right about that! Building and exploring other camps (including the infamous Death Church) kept me playing for quite a while! 
---
I usually can loot the Flatwoods hotel but have never gotten any from the prison. I can see the weights there, they just don't register as anything.
---
I‚Äôve been revived by the person who downed me before
---
Sounds like deep rock, is it deep rock?
---
Now there's a guy who can count to 21!
---
I had this bug on mg Dragon as well nuke zone white springs was a joke. It disapeared shortly.  
---
I too have serious doubts. PVP and Survival mode wont keep people playing IMO
---
The games whole premise is that you are americas savior.
---
Cool thanks I'll give it a try 
---
 OK. Its not the Scorched. They are just Scorched humans and Scorched come in all flavors. 
---
 I spent a pleasant 5 minutes yesterday watching the South Cutthroat Camp get attacked by a Scorchbeast. I could have killed her, a level 50 easily, but watching her work out was great. One particular part I found amusing as the Molemen there had to fight Scorched Molemen.
---
 Its the Scorch and the Scorchbeast is just a manifestation of that in a mutated bat. The Scroch killed everyone. We are all that's left.
---
Of course but people that were running around 1 shotting have most likely spent hundreds of hours in game already. They did the challenging stuff ad nauseam. TSEs werent being used straight out the vault and by brand new players. It made the grind funner thats why everyone has OP melee builds...so no i guess people dont like a challenge they just want to Rambo everything cause its funner.
---
Not that he needed your acceptance anyways 
---
Yeah i had to make a new character to get achievements for things i had originally done during beta.
---
I was lvl 21 or 22 when beta ended so everything up to that point i had to replay on an alt since none of it got counted.. i would bet any beta player is the same way and doesnt even realize it unless they start digging into their achievements like i did at lvl80 and was like well shit.
---
Absolutely. 
---
Dweller 1 :"When the vault opens let's work together to build a settlement and clear the wasteland!"
---
Dweller 2: "I'm sorry I'm only able to communicate via an emote wheel so.... finger guns."
---
Link to 6 redddit posts?
---
The whole reason i bought 76 was because it's next level gaming. It's weird talking to you literal-heads who only want it to be more basic, analogue and grindey boring.
---
Sounds like you bearly made it! 
---
No you may not. But now that you mention it, we will now make it cost 20 screws to craft.
---
Sounds like he bearly made it 
---
I should be able to 1 shot a level 5 super mutant with my tse pump in close range. 
---
I can actually count to 22, thank you very much.
---
 I was only about level 30-35 because I was *that guy* lol, we had a big team of about 10+ with us though, later on when I was able to contribute I was 50-55, and we only needed around 6, be warned though, not every queen fight is finished, she has a 30 minute timer
---
Well, thing is. There are what, five or six of those? And given the way nukes work, honestly even just nuking the Prime is basically going to destroy the entirety of Appalaccia.
---
Game wise, they don't nuke everything. Just Whitesprings, lol.
---
impressive
---
Yeah I agree that's exactly what should happen. I dont think it would be OP. Heck if you have 15 in one it should be strong. 
---
I know you see this a lot, and many of them are probably full of shit (they never quit and keep laying, or they never did play and ‚Äúquit‚Äù to add negative fuel to a game they already hated), but....the white knight nerf and requiring ballistic fiber for everything literally made my husband and I quit. We literally walked away and gave up on the game.
---
He completely abandoned it. I still watch the forums in morbid curiosity now and then. I haven‚Äôt seen a dumpster fire of a game go up in flames this bad since Defiance. Curious how it will end. I‚Äôm guessing neglect and gradual starvation to death by the devs.
---
I mock conspiracy theories, but at this point it actually does look like they‚Äôre deliberately trying to kill the game. At a minimum, those in charge do not play it meaningfully, or have any kind of clue.
---
Add me ollyvass and I'll put the mods on for you, just give me the materials 
---
Does it require a membership?
---
On behalf of the guy trying to keep up with you who you refused to team up with or share.... no.
---
The most fun and heart warming is when you see multiple squads sharing legendaries.
---
 Just get rid of the whole thing. The loot whores would leave and we could get on with the game.
---
Yes it is worth providing. Your entire counter argument is literally 
---
\&gt;  I can one shot anything with my melee why can't they one shot with a gun? 
---
I demand proof of this ability. 
---

---
Someone using a level 45 TSE gauss rifle killing a Mirelurk Queen in 1 shot pre patch. 
---
Imo the people being dead in this region makes sense due to scorched. There are actual notes left by NPCs still alive who flee the area such as the guy who founds the undercity in fo3
---
I'm still hoping the blackbird paintjob comes back eventually.
---
The machine eating people's gear though, that's cool, leave that!
---
Yes but then people whined about pvp and they neutered it without adding other ways for players to really split and coop.
---
I don't know, Even though it's the beasts that cause the scorched, I've seen plenty of notes and holotapes (particularly at the airport, iirc) saying that it's the scorched specifically that are attacking the most and killing lots of people. And those soft wussies taking out people like the Enclave or BoS is a bunch of crap and is definitely just Bethesda trying to find an excuse to not have NPCs.
---
No
---
I got it at Level 100.
---
That's part of the "luck" I mentioned. I got lucky and didn't get any glitched trophies.
---
I don't know if that trophy will pop once you're past 100. None of the reports I've seen of it end with "it unlocked when I hit a certain level!" The census was that it needs to be patched.
---
Nuke hole, kill bat.  Celebrate with repairs and paltry loot.
---
Hardly, I'm just as pissed off as you. 
---
Zero feedback where as, we used to get something from other Fallouts
---
I've been trying to organize similar stuff on sundays PST afternoon PS4 for a few weeks now - more like 2 teams, 2 workshops, all out war. PSNid Enterres
---
If you have to tell people how they are supposed to be invested, then the story telling has failed.
---
Was it PC or console? If 76 was just PC the fixes could come faster, but console has hoops to jump through to push a patch out.
---
Protest March and Its a trap have worked fine for me since the last patch. Swarm of suitors only works half the time for me.
---
This is why cheating happened.
---
Never seen one in fo76, seen every thing else tho, even a mega sloth in the forest and I didn't even know they could spawn there lol
---
I want an eyepatch already!
---
I have served hopped this vendor for dozens and dozens of hours over the past couple months for the outfits to sell. I can for a fact tell you that if someone has their camp on his spawn point he spawns on the other side of the road on the side of the station by the bridge. 
---
I'm not. I have no reason to believe it will get better. All we get are empty words with everything being intentionally vague - "upcoming content", "future updates" etc. 
---
I've been hypothesizing as to why they would be actively trying to tank their own game but I haven't really come up with anything solid. The best I got is that they never intended to support the game and just wanted to get a quick bit of money from the initial sales.
---
I believe this was originally fixed with patch 3 or 4 , patch 5 brought it back and I guess it didn‚Äôt go away with the hot fix 
---
Stacking armor effects
---
5 x 15% reduced while standing still
---
5 x 15% reduced while sprinting
---
5 x 15% reduced while blocking
---
Any of those can appear with
---
5 x 8% reduced from other players
---
Throw in some medX, and damage reducing perks and they won't take any damage.
---
Will hopefully be the next big nerf
---
So... I shouldn't because you've claimed you're something on the Internet, and are completely refusing to actually argue the point (just saying "I'm right because of things totally unrelated to the argument")
---
And again, I ask if this system would have negative effects on your gameplay, and ask what they may be?
---
They have started spreading variety for the servers I've been on
---
People looking into the source code see evidence of vault quests like fixing a reactor so those should be coming eventually
---
Remember the interview where they were excited about the pvp encounter? 
---
I forgot who was talking... but he just summed it as he saw someone wanted on the map. He fast traveled to their location. He took out his sniper rifle and head shotted him. He then logged off. 
---
The logged off part I didn‚Äôt pay attention to but that I believe is the most important part. What makes this game unpleasant is the fact your actions don‚Äôt have any weight compared to any and every fallout. 
---
If you shot an npc that town they lived in was your enemy. That makes sense to some degree. Even without laws in a post apocalyptic world actions had consequences. In 76 nothing has any meaning whatsoever. And whoever got angrier is the loser. That‚Äôs the only game you can play in 76. 
---
If you do the cranberry bog sites to get cores you also net a bunch of military ammo bags...
---
So he still spawns even if someone has a camp placed on his spawn point?
---

Thanks for the info on that encounter point though!

Adrenal reaction, psychobuff, whiskey, a ton of different food items, high rads and radicool, herd mentality with strange in numbers turned on. All of these offer equal or better strength/damage. Trust me two points isn't anything. Really it's only useful if you have a set just for carrying stuff.
---
i farmed scorched earth on xbox's LFG.  i just run around reviving low levels
---
Did you hold up signs or anything ?
---
I'm just tired.....
---
Nothing Bethesda has done in last few months to make my game more enjoyable. 
---
 And I like many have played through unstable servers. Etc etc etc etc etc Give up ? Getting close ? Just had enough of the game I have loved since the Original :(
---
I will see Prime nuked every so often, which is nice because I've only done it once, but other than that it's still always Whitesprings. People just want to farm the ghouls.
---
There is no fuel to be used. And they have never allowed us to rebuild cars. 
---
I've been playing since beta but im finally taking a break; I'll still be checking patch updates see if it gets any better. Then I'll come back.
---
I pre-ordered. I don't regret it, even though it's broken as hell and I'll probably not touch it again. I did have a good 3 weeks with 3 friends all playing
---
Good catch on that typo, thanks! Have edited the post.
---
You mean a future notification that they are looking into it for a future patch, in the meantime buy something from the shop
---
Ugh, no, that sounds boring.  If I can chart out what equipment I will get and when, I‚Äôd lose all interest.
---
The way to fix the game's legendary drops is to basically rip off Diablo's gem system. Let players scrap legendary drops to gather legendary mods which fit into legendary sockets. Mods come in degrees of potency, like for example an "Irradiator" mod that fits a semi-automatic weapon's slots and adds 2/4/8/16/32 radiation damage depending on how high you've upgraded your mod.
---
Give players a way to craft their "dream" weapon.
---
A better response would be " if you don't like them don't support them in the future. " Letting your wallet speak will work wonders if everyone jumps on board
---
It takes 5 minutes to read the suggestions and then 100 man hours to implement them, hours that aren't going into content.
---
You guys repost the same petty crap daily.
---
F03 had a broken walking animation so i consider everything we got to be gravy and consistent with the quality of the other Fo games.
---
A fridge would be nice but between the programmer, the play testers Q&amp;A and then certification that's a $20,000 patch they're putting out monthly.
---
Your criticism should be put into asking for player freedom to create mods that can be officially implemented.
---
Yes. I have severe hopped Charleston station hundreds of times. I can say it is purely random how often he spawns. I've had days where he's spawned over a dozen times and days where he never spawns. But I can say for certain he does spawn even with camps there. His trigger is at the other end of the bridge. If someone's camp is on his spawn point it seems the game engine just drops him on the other side of the road if someone's camp is there. The same goes for all the other events that trigger there as well. Scorched, super mutants and the like will spawn on the tracks of just off the tracks on the other side if a camp is in the way. 
---
I've only seen prime nuked once that was when the TSE was still able to one shot it using bobbleheads and what not. Dead within seconds
---
Worked on me. I refuse to do this needless grind and store spam. Ill just sit back and watch what happens next
---
:(
---
You‚Äôve never seen the red cans that say Handy fuel? Lolz
---
There was one in the beta and they removed it for some reason 
---
Simple, buy another game that works. Flawlessly. 
---
Been years since I've encountered a game so broken as this one. I'm still playing. Don't get me wrong, but OMFG Fix The Fucking thing as I'm not avoiding playing with my Friends who are playing other Flawless Games Forever. I miss the banter and Fun 
---
Exactly how I got mine.
---
Just curious, had anything happened that might have caused this? Such as rapidly dropping junk (not the wep), or scrapping, or a disconnect? None of these should apply, but in one of my cases an equipped outfit went into the junk bag while rapidly emptying the Junk tab. 
---
They‚Äôve never allowed us to play with other players...until now, so why notü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This!!

It kinda sounds like the game is not using the radeon, but instead your intergrated card. Check your control settings for the radeon.
---
 The airport. ;) OK you will not get a good understanding anywhere on the west side of the map.
---
 Its the Scorch that wants humans all dead. Not any particular creature infected by it.

In all seriousness- I‚Äôm not always trolling. Most of the time I‚Äôm making accurate points that nobody can debate other than saying ‚ÄúI enjoy the game‚Äù which is never my issue 
---
Hey if you want to put some kerosene into your car to use that in place of gasoline feel free to. 
---
Yeah you already told me you didn't pay any attention
---
Ah yes. 
---
That‚Äôs the point of my post..
---
Because those games were all single player games. This one is multiplayer. As well as most of the map will not be able to use a car to get to. 
---
Why are you on a message board for a game you have no interest in playing?
---
Do you realize just how fucking stupid you sound when you say things like this? 
---
I mean really really ducking stupid.
---
That‚Äôs you. Really fucking stupid.
---
Thank you for reiterating that, I wanted to make sure there was no ambiguity in what you were saying. Will reference this is in the post.
---
Exactly this.
---
You can remove EVERY SINGLE note, terminal and holotape from 76 and it would still be the exact same game from start to finish. You'd do the exact same things for the exact same results and explore the exact same places. There is no narrative.
---
Take the characters out of Fallout 4, which starts and ends with character driven narrative, and the game changes completely.
---
I have found a key card for it and it is a random encounter. There was a dead body and a doctor's bag with the key card in it and a holotape. Hope this helps you guys.
---
&gt;And again, I ask if this system would have negative effects on your gameplay, and ask what they may be?
---
PVP was decided in development; Beth will release a survival mode. I want content instead of changing the entire premise. You don't understand how business, management, or programming works.
---
The way you play is boring.
---
Only other than asking for it.
---
Shut up.
---
In 150 hours I've repaired 1 piece of armor and it was a low level piece that I should have just dumped. I assume this is only a problem for melee players and thus don't have to farm ammo. 
---
As with pretty much every other "this mechanic is too hard" complaint, git gud.
---
Welcome to our world, must be so trying for you. üòï
---
Still on the subreddit, given out fux
---
Didn't the cars run off nuclear power? So, fusion cores maybe?
---
I‚Äôve only ever seen one.  Never seen a sloth.
---
Tell me squire, how did the dead people thank you?  Or are you referring to your empty box victory of saving the world from Skyrim dragons?  You didn't wipe off your chin and your breath stinks.
---
For potential he means why don't you post your schedule / contact info / fun ideas instead of whining @ Beth? How do you make this MMO fun?
---
Seems like this reddit is 99% munchkin grinders who do nothing except nerdy math on damage #'s and endless farming. What would you do with 25 players? Get them to upvote your post?
---
Nobody has ever posted this!  Certainly not multiple times a day for months!
---
TEY BROAK NEW GROUUUND!!1!
---
Yeah, but I think it was only in one of the first few beta sessions, because after I made my first one, I could never find it again.
---
I agree, being able to just make exact what you want with no challenge sounds horribly boring. But I'm not sure that's what anyone is suggesting here (so far). The idea is to have more control over builds, because the current RNG on legendary drops makes it exceedingly difficult to get gear that you want, even if you're grinding every single day.  That's not fun for any casual player, and it's not even all that fun for the more devoted players. 
---
Wished I could get support on this like I thought I would :(
---
Console. And naw realm Royale.
---
well I mean it's only a west virginia problem so...
---
Realm Royale but deep rock also does this!
---
WHAT AN ASTOUNDING REVELATION! GOLD STAR FOR OP
---
People still play the game? 
---
maybe it's way of saying, while annoying, it's not as frustrating to him as some people make it out to be.
---
Is this your way of getting your hate rage on? How sad. you go around attacking a game. I mean, really? Pathetic. 
---
That would spread throughout the wasteland
---
Because Bethesda needs to be held accountable. 
---
Because you are a dick, clearly. 
---
&gt;f I headshot an unarmored creature it should be dead, not slightly irritated
---
Why?
---
I've been saying this. I can craft laser weapons and power my CAMP using fusion power but I cant get car or motorbike to run. It's not like there's no tools or workshops. I thought about this too during Abbie's quest as I walk past that upright, intact blue bike...
---
Bruh I commented the same thing and I saw urs right after
---
Unfortunately more common that not. 
---
Totally.  IMO, they could learn a lot from the Loot 2.0 system in Diablo 3 as well. 
---
I just learned the plan for legs from scrapping, same with helmet and torso, only plan I ever bought was for arms.
---
Depends on what they choose to shoot you with üòÇ I always take out the left gun arm through VATS so they don't even have a chance to do DMG while I Grognak their asses
---
&gt;  We don't censor people
---
Except shadow banning anyone who posts with negative karma. They think their posts are going through, but they're not.
---
I‚Äôm rarely on a server myself, and it seems like there are plenty of other people from the vault out there. 
---
Haha yeah, I got downvoted so often for giving the game fair criticism despite having fun, and stopped posting when the fun stopped and the community remained an echo chamber. I've had guys tell me not to worry cause in a year there'll be faction pvp and private servers so everything will be sunshine and rainbows, but clearly Bethesda is abandoning ship.
---
 Steel! What a score. The 3 stars are rare. ;)
---
To everyone that says the story sucks in this game.....listen and read the damn holo's its actually interesting and well fleshed out nd who saud thats the ending? It's just what we have so far.
---
I saw an upright intact and perfectly staged bike in the mire.
---
Graft on train station used to spawn them before patch 5 , I haven‚Äôt logged in since the hot fix so not sure anymore 
---
It just dropped on completing ‚ÄúAn Organic Solution‚Äù and got the recipe for Rad Shield
---
Uh? It's the place that welcomes you to watoga transit center. I suppose it's a fair question if you are deaf, but othervise a bit odd.
---
At least he had the decency to give you ammo too.
---
Gotcha 
---
I don't play a video game to read.
---
&gt; TEY BROAK NEW GROUUUND!!1! 
---
They **broke** new ground alright. 
---
‚ÄúYou are one of those too impatient‚Äù
---
They released this game as a AAA $60 game and falsely advertised everything about his game since launch.  It‚Äôs not even about ‚Äúdemanding now‚Äù it‚Äôs about having standards as a consumer and to not be taken advantage of.  You‚Äôre defending a game company that doesn‚Äôt give a shit about you.  FO76 is equal to the shit EA pulled back with BF and loot boxes. I applaud you for sinking with the ship buddy.
---
I agree. I used the hunting rifle from as soon as I could get it til around level 30. The only complaint I have is fire rate but that's the trade off for DMG I suppose.
---
We shall see when outer worlds releases
---
As someone that played the game it is all true.
---
You have got to be shitting me then why complain about a game that you knew wouldn't have the spoon fed story you seem to want?
---
I'd even go for the heavy RNG and grinding fest that Bethesda wants and take a system where you can farm specific areas for the plans to craft a legendary mod that requires farming for specific mats.
---
These drop locations could be heavily hinted at in holos and notes along the lines of "Hey, come to my place later. I was fighting off some Anglers in the Mire when I was harvesting strangler pods and I got a great idea on how I could modify your hunting rifle to fire incendiary rounds. Bring some of those firecracker berries that grow out behind your house. I got the rest of the stuff already."
---
That‚Äôs my one problem with FO76
---
There‚Äôs no human NPC‚Äôs
---
No lively cities.
---
No safe areas.
---
Nothing.
---
Unfortunate after effect of Bethesda clearing not giving a shit about their player base. 
---
I'm complaining about the ending. And how bad it is
---
That didn't answer the question at all. And I'm glad you are of the opinion other people shouldn't play the game a certain way because you think it's boring, very telling that a philosopher cannot understand or look at things from other points of view.
---
I fully understand how programming works too, though the engine they use is potentially very complicated due to its age.
---
What affects would my suggestion have on YOUR gameplay experience?
---
What a lore-friendly way to approach it, I could totally get behind this
---
.....wow.
---
Once again who said that was the ending? 
---
Dont matter, just re-instance when it runs low, itll recharge to full and youll never run out
---
Unfortunate after effect of nothing ventured nothing gained. FO single player base too loud and ungrateful 
---
The game did. The game ends, no more main quests. Sure there will be DLC but that doesn't matter because that isn't out yet so we don't know what it is 
---
Any chance you are on PS4, if so I can make you one so you can try it out b4 you buy the plans. Personally I am not fond of it as a rifleman player and largely prefer the Lever Action Rifle especially after the reload change
---
I just dropped a 3-star super mutant out of watoga and he dropped a non legendary pistol.
---
Apparently not. 
---
I think the other studios helped create some new assets and the world itself but Bethesda Austin are the ones who are supposed to make it work in an online multiplayer environment. 
---
How do you get a good collection of mutations?
---
It must be difficult to get one or even two you like without getting ones you don‚Äôt want.
---
Is there a good/easy method of collecting 1-3 desired mutations while not receiving counter-active ones?
---
I run a melee (tank) build focusing on high damage resistance/ high STR/ while my gf plays a ranged hunting rifle build. I‚Äôm thinking for my level 40 melee build something like:
---
- marsupial 
---
- grounded
---
- herd mentality (I only play co-op)
---
- twisted muscles
---
What would be the best way to only receive these mutations?
---
Look, you can't just say you declare transparency and expect something to happen.
---
No, someone has to kill you.
---
Great post; every time a gamer posts a Pepe face or tells me how literal he is i'm reminded the philosophy of neo-cons isn't so disparate. 
---
My big civil question is simply: what would you do with 25 players in the existing frame work? Without a good answer they're simply not qualified to critique this MMO. They just don't get social gaming or how to use reddit as a hub.
---
I have a similar problem cause I‚Äôm right next to a pond and I either spawn in a rock or in my pond and if my water purifier don‚Äôt spawn in I‚Äôm royally fucked
---
I can one head shot a level 68 super mutant with my normal lever rifle
---
Yeah he's in the back of a truck not too far from Big Bend Tunnel West. 
---
Ending implys theres nothing left no more to do ever this is not the case and yes dlc does matter why wouldn't it fallout4 was hot garbage until dlc like far harbor and nuka world.
---
On low health I've randomly died several times when I tried to unequipt two perks in luck tree, one giving random repairs into weapon health, one into armor, when shooting or taking damage, to try to equip streched genes to heal the radiation.
---
I don't really get the connection between taking damage to die, and unequiping two perk cards that don't affect my health or rads in any manner.
---
They weren‚Äôt criticizing, they were telling them how to update and progress their game. Downvote this üñïüèº
---
I don‚Äôt know wtf you are talking about.
---
It shoots missiles at you. If you kill it from far away, you can loot of its ammo. 500+ bullets and 60+ missiles. 
---
No never got it, I quited the game because of that. Maybe when some dlc drops of they fix the trophy I will be playing again. 
---
&gt; That didn't answer the question at all.
---
Because you're being obstinate and literal. PVP is here deal with it or go play Anthem.
---
I‚Äôve found the plans for both out in the world in random places. I‚Äôve bought the mods for both at harpers and Phoenix 
---
For the atom store?
---
No, at the moment DLC doesn't matter. We dont know what the hell it is so we cant say anything. The vaults probably are dlc but exploring a small vault doesnt add shit to the main story
---
It‚Äôs kinda silly because, let‚Äôs face it, how many of us have cliff or riverside houses? Every single time we port in we land deep in the water or far below our houses.
---
But maybe it‚Äôs getting better.  Last night at Harpers Ferry I targeted a 62lvl super mutant but he was listed as a dissected mouth breathing ghoul or some such.  Maybe the land be changing ... or maybe we laugh at the bugs because at least it wasn‚Äôt a server disconnect.  
---
There are no small bugs it‚Äôs all ‚Äòas designed‚Äô. 
---
You kinda answered your own question. It‚Äôll take many levels to get the shotgun cards and more to shift SPECIAL to strength to use them. How do you feel about 15 - 20 levels of shifting? Obviously less if you already have any cards from random packs. 
---
I see it a lot after a nuke. After all the glowing guys are dead, you either get scorched or bots it seems. 
---
Don‚Äôt forget Dodgy/Serendipity/Evasive.  Essentially they become unkillable. But don‚Äôt worry, you can just port over into the new PvP server. What could be wrong with that?
---
‚ÄúMichael, breaking your disc in half and cutting up the pieces doesn‚Äôt change anything. Your character is still on the server.‚Äù
---
Oki thx, I found the mod for the marine not for the combat for now
---
This is such a hilarious post. While I‚Äôm happy for your friend finding some enjoyment in this shit game, it just shows how repetitive and innane everything about it is when the only ones finding enjoyment are on the spectrum. 
---
PVX is totally my thing i organize workshop PVP - PS4. sundays, PST afternoon PSNid Enterres
---
The time is now Beth doesn't need to spoon feed us anything.
---
Well there's two entrances and stuff in between? It's not a huge-ass place to go check out. 
---
Also, while a lot of places are bigger from inside, the tunnel is much bigger on the outside.
---
1 steel for each star... seems legit.
---
I got 2 missiles, some circuits and steel, and a minigun with 100 ammo. It is very deadly at any range also.
---
There were allot of player tag parts selling them. We ventured. I did grid lots of levels to get some though
---
Nope. Because I do a job like that, just in a different industry.  Reading the visceral reactions every day takes its toll. And worse, when you care about the community yet know you are just pasting company approved crap, it leads to stress that bleeds into the personal life.
---
We can judge that once The Outer Worlds is 5 months old. 
---
Get off the high horse...
---
Cause all in smelling is shit from you.
---
For real. I‚Äôve always thought it would be cool from a story perspective if after the SBQ is killed we get a handle on the Scorched, things chill out and bands of settlers and roving raider parties etc. start wandering back into the area. I mean, if we deal with the Scorched and the area becomes considerably safer why would people resettle Appalachia? Add to that potential vaults opening and dwellers emerging. I don‚Äôt see why we couldn‚Äôt get some real NPCs. 
---
The legendary ones will run and hide. There are lots of them, but it‚Äôs typically only a one star item. 
---
&gt; And yet you are declaring theses opinions as if they are cold hard facts.
---
No, I'm not. You're presenting my opinions as facts, simply to argue. Which I'm done doing with you.
---
Absolutely.
---
No effendi but I don't believe that for a second.  Todd said multiple studios were working on the game,  which I think is BS too.  Fact is till I see proof, I assume based on my 400 hrs in game that monkeys are working on it.  
---
Make it available for atoms. I'd buy atoms. 
---
Player owned posts selling them. Gor others into it. 
---
yeah, they are just a cleaner version of the normal metal ones 
---
If you can get up in it's face, it won't be able to do much besides try to punch you, which are a lot safer than it's ranged attacks.
---
I usually just go smack it a couple times with my sledge and it goes down pretty quick
---
This is the shit show sub for Fallout 76 the invested players are on other subs
---
Yea I‚Äôm about to quit as well, I‚Äôll keep reading the patch notes to see if they ever patch it
---
Rule number one
---
hUh
---
The say what now? This some time of rare enemy?
---
Try r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
I was half way through a long explaination/rant but decided fuck this I'm gonna go enjoy the game. Adios!
---
Amen to that. I‚Äôm getting really tired of spawning under my friend‚Äôs CAMPs and under the ground and into water when I first load into my own. 
---
Well it‚Äôs going to pain you that they‚Äôve already made at least 100 million in revenue. Hopefully they fix the game. Things were going good until this last patch hopefully the next one is better 
---
[lmfao](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=irony)
---
It does what it advertises...
---
And also causes memory problems that crash your game, and potentially the games of players around you.
---
Why not just answer the question instead of being obtuse and vague, guessing you are just making this all up anyway.
---
She then made you do a hundred fetch quests, which, because they were so boring, made you just quit and restart with a different character... I'm a bit angry about her quests if you can't tell 
---
This sub is full of cry babies that blame Bethesda for ruining their lives
---
A repeat suggestion? In this sub?! My god this is a first. It‚Äôs also the first time someone has commented about it being a repeat! 
---
Check /u/Aten_Ra post history
---
Fucking. Shut. Up.
---
I can't watch any of my gaming related YouTube channels without cringing because *everyone* has to include some kind of memey dig at 76.
---
I can't visit my regular gaming related subreddits without cringing because "lolol this is what would happen if Bethesda designed this scene/game/world".
---
My coworkers talk shit about 76 when discussing other games entirely.
---
Every other god damn article I scroll by when looking for gaming news is "Why Fallout 76 is a Bad Game".
---
EVERY top ten worst games list has Fallout 76 at the top, along with a diatribe that just says it's a bad game without going into why it's a bad game, even if other games on the list were objectively *worse*.
---
**It's exhausting.** Even with the problems it had at launch, even with the weird anti consumer BS Bethesda shat out with the canvas bags, even the most rattled person alive has to see how exhausting this is.
---
And it's not exhausting just because hating the game has become a meme. You could argue that every bad game gets some kind of meme around it.
---
But holy fuck, guys. Even No Man's Sky didn't get *this* much obnoxious noise. Most bad games get a "wtf is this they could have done better" and then everyone fucks off to play better games. Nope. People seem obsessed with saying "76 sucks" and buying a game they KNOW they won't like just to get a spot in the echo chamber.
---
Being angry about a game's state is one thing. But when the devs are actively making changes, are listening to our feedback, and are giving updates (yes, after we made noise, I admit), why are we still hating on it?
---
We *get it*. The game was not released in the best state. It was released far too early, was not tested the way it should have been, and yes, we deserve better for our $60/$30/$0 we spent for it. And yes, the canvas thing was asinine.
---
I'm sorry for the high and mighty soapbox rant, but this shit is what I wake up to when I went to check the news or to see any videos I missed, like I always do. I've unsubbed from a lot of things, but even then, I can't really escape it. Why are we bitching about 76 still? You think RDR2 did better? GO PLAY THAT. WHY THE DAMN HELL ELSE ARE YOU HERE.
---
I just want to see one video where Bethesda is actually being acknowledged for making changes to the game. ONE. Because everyone is acting like the game is in the exact same state it was on the day of launch and it's almost maddening.
---
Just *stop* with the cringey videos and clickbait and inserting this shit into conversations it doesn't belong in. I'm one of the most cynical pieces of shit alive, but even I need a breather fucking once in awhile.
---
Truly a thing of legend! This story will be spread far and wide and resonate through centuries to come!
---
Can confirm it was after a nuke. The nuke zone was gone, but there were still nuked flora.
---
 Late at night the kids are in bed. Its quite a bit better then. ;)
---
Fax lol
---
Can you give us some more details on what happened, was it advertised, did Bethesda know what was going on? 
---
Using your money to excuse that your a shitty person doesn't mean anything.
---
LOL. I applaud nothing about you and your stupidity. 
---
I'm being obstinate?
---
Pot. Kettle. Black.
---
You still haven't answered the question, and are under the impression that PvP would be removed, it wouldn't, it just means that people who don't want to participate don't have to (an idea that was in the game from the very beginning of it) 
---
That's actually a really badass idea. Bravo. I would be shit if they actually did this.
---
Just lost all my ammo to it yesterday!!!
---
I'll be honest, I didn't even bother looking for people when the team went in. I just started grabbing every fan, pen, pencil and desk toy in sight.
---
Yeah downvote me becouse i want bugs fixed, lmaaooo this sub.
---
That‚Äôs not irony. But what do I expect from someone so stupid.
---
The comparison between fo76 and MA:A needs to stop. 
---
Fo76 is not gonna have the plug pulled, and they pretty much said that free content rollouts are on the way. 
---
You can sit there and not trust them, that‚Äôs on you, but don‚Äôt be surprised if you are proven wrong. 
---
It‚Äôs obvious they want those pvp players to enjoy their full pvp experience by the survival mode implementation soon. Be certain pve servers will be better due to those moving. 
---
Again: you arnt owed anything by Beth. 
---
 He dead on the ground somewhere in the Savage Divide. Silly Flatwoods Monster. ;)
---
You are confused on what type of game this is
---
Half my games on Steam haven't been played at all.
---
You on Xbox? 
---
I don't have a spare currently but if I find one I can hook you up.
---
Don‚Äôt you have to do them either way? Like, all roads lead to Rosie. 
---
Just to check, nukes didn't exist in this game pre-war, right? They didn't use nuclear power *at all* in their societies right? There's just *no way* anybody could have irradiated plants *before* the war. Let's just gloss over the fact that there are lists in the Whitesprings bunker showing a good deal of research has been performed on nuked flora (canonically *before* we launched any nukes on WV). 
---
So, I ask again, why?
---
You can shoot between the openings of the train carts and use them as a barrier, so it doesn't slaughter you. 
---
If Bethesda saw the original post on here, then Yes. 
---
It was advertised.
---
What happened, read above, it was a Silent Demonstration from members of the Fallout Facebook Group. 
---
Not talking about the game in general. I'm referring to all the posts about in game adjustments/balances. The tse guns were far too overpowered. The white knight was also very overpowered. They both needed balancing. The game was never intended to be as easy as those two examples made it.
---
I am not happy about the state of the game either. Patches break more things than they fix.
---
It is getting better but at a snail's pace. I doubt they have more than a small handful of developers left working on it still. There are far better games in the works to put too many resources back into this game.
---
That being said I paid full price for this game too, but I've gotten far more than my 60$ worth out of it.
---
He is clearly on the Bethesda‚Äòs payroll to do the opinion control like some parties still in the world nowadays.
---
So he is not the one who wastes life.
---
Protips: doing cancer job makes you have one eventually.
---
Is the responder bot an eyebot? ?
---
They really aren't that hard to come by so quit complaining it's getting old. White night is still highly effective, but apparently this sub is filled with whining cry babies.  
---
Who is Betheada? What are you talking about?
---
Exquisite quote, I tip my hat to you sir.
---
Maybe I'm the only one on this, but when Radroaches are chosen as the enemy to attach either junkyard, sometimes there are issues with them blending into the floor of a trailer. I'll see the diamond, but no roach. I can see something "skipping" in and out. Shooting, hitting no effect, same trying to get to it under the trailer.
---
Hmm, there's a workshop that makes automatic/heavy weapons viable.  Nerf it!
---
I would love that, but I want walls that don‚Äôt have shit smeared on them first. We have floors, but why no clean walls?
---
What are you expecting them to be grateful for?
---
Great reply, you don't look at this page much. But Thankyou for taking the time to type that. Must of felt so much Fun 
---
&gt; Why not just answer the question...
---
Because I don‚Äôt want the sub to be brigaded by haters.
---
Technically they invaded well before winter and Hitler‚Äôs mistake was in arrogantly believing the Soviets would crumble before winter and so not properly supplying the troops. 
---
Don't worry. Eventually it will be back to just bootlickers thanking the corporations for selling them things.
---
&gt; It seems rude to place your camp in such away that blocks other people from enjoying the game... there's zero reason for a level 188 to be doing it. 
---
Well, that's a bit presumptuous. I didn't even know the responder bot ***existed*** until I was 250+ hours into the game.  Does that make me "irresponsible"?
---
I could copy-paste this comment into about half the threads on this sub and it would make sense. Sad.
---
My anti-armor multipurpose axe does the same thing.
---
No, the one [half-buried in a truck](https://i.imgur.com/HFJitQ2.jpg) is just an [animatronic robot from Nuka-World](https://imgur.com/J2fopqo.jpg).  [It seems](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afu598/flatwood_monster_mystery_revealed/) the Flatwoods Monster is one tho.
---
*you‚Äôre. If you‚Äôre going to be belittling at least do it with good grammar. 
---
You do know why ppl don't bother with workshop?
---
Disconnection, then lost everything. if you actually played this game for few days
---
I may get brave and try at some point, just haven't felt like it yet.
---
Very well said.
---
I'll give that a try. I do have the exact number the mats on me. Thanks.
---
You can collect Suppy Drop Holotapes.  They're not too rare. I've played for 80 hours and collected 20+
---
Lol yeah but it's true
---
Removing pre defined legendary weapon and armor from game is the way to go. Or we should be able to salvage them for legendary crafting materials.
---
Enemies should drop a legendary crafting material of any form, as junk materials.
---
Player should be able to craft the desired set at will. You want to make players play longer? Just make stuff like explosive-twoshot-bloody junk even more rare. But with this way, we won't be sad for getting a vampiric ripper.
---
This seems good
---
yes!
---
Wtf 
---
Ok remove the $60. And then address everything I said. You have nothing lol
---
For some reason she kept asking me to find an ultra-lightweight mod for bobby pins.
---
I have similar problems.  I have task manager running on my second monitor, and I notice that the GPU "3D" percentage (I assume this means the processes it's handling to draw 3D graphics) hits 100%, and my frame rate starts dropping to an unplayable level.  This happens if I go to large areas with lots of enemies (mostly Whitesprings), but not always.  Sometimes it just sort of fixes itself (like if I go away from Whitesprings, and stay away from there for a while) and other times it never remedies and I close and re-open the game.
---
I'm fairly certain it has to do with rendering lots of enemies that aren't in your area, because I've noticed it mostly around Whitesprings (my CAMP is in that area, but far enough away to not get nuked).
---
Autocorrect on a phone. Did you know that people who point out grammar as a way to belittle people suffer from immaturity? 
---
Scientifically proven. 
---
Why in Mothman's name would a wasteland wanderer want to *scrape* their ammo, I wonder? Does it get more speed that way? Will it kill more cleanly? Does the op want more junk?
---
Demonstrating what? How poor the game still is? Or lack of transparency and communication from the dev team? Or was it to say you guys are happy with the game? 
---
I'm curious what the demonstrating's group opinion of the game is. 
---
It's done by their Austin Texas studio.
---
I built at the pond/lake across from the Top of the World Station. There‚Äôs a natural entrance just before the highway bridges the lake and the entrance to my CAMP faces away from the water. I spawn the other side of the building every time, the wall between the lake bed and the highway is too tall to jump and I had to build a set of stairs connected to my roof just to get safely out of the water and to my front door üôÑ
---
Good. I‚Äôll stay young forever then. 
---
That‚Äôs how stupid you are. 
---
No, there are 3 responder bots I am aware of. 
---
Responder eyebot  
---
Responder protectron  
---
Responder Vendor bot protectron.
---
The latter is labelled as a vendor, and can trade with you. Is usually accompanied by a Brahmin and 2 eyebots.
---
FO4 is an rpg, FO76 is an rpg mmo. There is supposed to be a difference in grinding.
---
I feel sorry for you if spending $40 on a video game means that much to you. 
---
 There is armor in the game.
---
Yup. Trying to catch up to you. 
---
Report him for threatening/harassment/whatever. Contact Xbox support ...
---
Seriously, how many of these posts are we going to see today? 
---
You ask too much.  I just want a right handed rifle
---
Already did. I just wanted this sub to know about him
---
Lvl 97 here...
---
I have 400+ screws and 200+ fiber, for the past month all I do in game is clear the crazy house and sell the weapons and bulked items to the 7 vendors, takes me an hour...
---
Farming is not that time consuming or that hard to do...
---
There's a couple of It's a Trap locations that have buggy SB spawns.  Especially the one closest to the NAR Railyard near Watoga.  If you start the Lure and then run to the Railyard to the NW you'll often find it on the ground either fighting in the yard or to the NW of it.  This does mean you'll exit the event.  Tag it and run back into the event area and it should follow you on the ground.
---
Same for the one that's up on the cliff in the Mire.  I forget the exact location. I've seen the SB on the ground below the cliff fighting, I usually tag it from a far, but more frequently see it to the NW on the ground somewhere outside the event area.
---
Showing up at their work because you don't like their game?
---
Get a grip, fellas.
---
Plaese share whatever you are smoking/ingesting, I ran out in November.
---
100 hours of programming vs you just skipping servers. You hate content.
---
So where was the flux in Fo4? You know, to build that decontamination arch?
---
The economics of this game reflect the unimaginative, game-hating mental abilities of the devs. You can suck their clocks all you want, but nothing good will come of it.
---
Almost every single terminal, document etc in Nuka World in FO4 had the same shit in it just written differently. 
---
Given the quality of writing it's absolutely histerical that Bethesda thought they can make a game of it. 
---
Altough considering standards of avarage gamers, they perhaps weren't wrong.
---
There are a few quests like that but not most.
---
Sure, just sent a request. Join me at my house and trade me the gun and resources
---
Sounds like playing Fallout 76 is really fun..................
---
Looking for someone to do this on PC. He has the last two furniture plans I need. 
---
I actually tried a Gunslinger Build.
---
Thought of it being VATS Crit Hesdshots based. Since it halfway works at low level ima not seeing it being viable in late to Endgame 
---
Lol just another muscle bound moron. Not even that good of a muscle bound moron. You need to work on your definition. Cause you‚Äôre brain is a lost cause. 
---
Nice tattoos. Did you just ask for all of page five? Is Adam Levine who you take inspiration from on tattoos?
---
Lol! What a goon!
---
I destroy camps because this is a post apocalyptic wasteland and it is an insult to my raider sensibilities to let other people live in the false comfort of a "home"
---
Can I ask what system your on?
---
Most ppl bought it from dupers.
---
Lol, ok
---
Or go to the BOS HQ and loot the 10+ ammo bags that are there, server hop, repeat. Also the 10 or so plastic plates. Easiest waybive found to get plastic and ballistic fiber in one run. Plusbyoubget straight jackets for caps and the weapons/PA for scrap metal.
---
I feel sorry for people that will throw away their principles just because of a price tag.
---
I spawn to under toxic water when traveling to my C.AM.P. I had to place stairs down there to get out.        This is my life now.
---
Like i said, anyone who works customer service ever deals with it, usually face to face rather than comfortably behind a computer screen with plenty of time to craft a response. 
---
And the reactions are justified. Id imagine the CMs can understand why people are upset with a broken product, no real news on the future besides PVP and Survival mode. 
---
Id take that job in a heartbeat as someone that has dealt with angry people face to face in customer service.  People are imitating it for free all over this subreddit
---
I believe you have to kill 3* legendary enemies and pray you get one. I‚Äôve heard a good way to do this is to do the hoard events in higher level areas. The scorchbeast queen might be good as well, but farming her is a lot more difficult(at least for me) so I would recommend the previous strategy.
---
That makes sense and would be a huge improvement, ergo, it won't happen.
---
The very first quest I did had me taking 'water samples'.
---
After getting all the water samples I turned them into a robot . . . who did nothing with them.  Nobody will ever see them and the reason for taking them is 20 years obsolete anyway.
---
The Overseer tells you to do these things, that its important - but not *why* you should do them.  
---
&gt; **The reason why I hate the story is that it's built up around helping people who aren't even alive anymore and pretending like they are! Seriously???** 
---
Yes, this is also a big problem for me. You know that there are no human NPCs and still, they do those quests. Find human NPC XY. Oh, he is dead... who would have thought that!? Specially when you do such quests over and over again. You already know, you follow the tracks and then you find a dead NPC. This already turns me off to do such quests.
---
Your actions dictate that you sir, are the moron tho xD
---
You hear bed springs creaking so you go to the bedroom and find mothman jumping on the bed. He gives you this look after he notices you...
---
You should delete his name as there is no witch-hunting on this sub. You‚Äôll be banned.
---
Its two guys, an intern, and a dog named 'Benji'.  He's one of those Jack Russel Terriers.  Smartest dogs alive.
---
Ok thanks for this. 
---
So you slowly back up and after you are out of sight the creaking starts again.
---
First you're assuming they are the overpowered machines of death that were before the patch. They are not. Just keep that in mind when they don't kill everything in one shot. And to answer your original question r/market76
---
Uniyielding armor gives +15str at low hp and if you get good rolls you can have 15 (perk ) 15 (uniyielding) 6 (weapon + armor 3rd rolls) bloody mess, adrenaline, slugger, nerd rage, twisted muscles, adrenal reaction mutation thats like 245% damage increase and 20% from strength alone i think, then you get party boy with whiskey thats another 9 strength and food .. yeah..
---
Lol I'm so glad I didnt buy this game
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie my first time getting chased out of white springs by a horde was one of the better memories... up until the disconnect at least
---
And those are the ones that are crying for the nerf.
---
I dig that, keep being you.
---
The issue I‚Äôm addressing is people destroying people‚Äôs camps, and blaming it on the victim. If people were just honest and said "I‚Äôm f**king this dudes s**t up because f**k him", I can actually get behind that as a raider mentality. Though I think ultimately if the victim calls it griefing, then sadly griefing it is.
---
I only captured Poseidon Energy (3x) after the most recent patch. I always had 3 cores in the generator after ~20 minutes. I'm on PC, a few people who reported the dropped rate are on console, so maybe there is a disparity?
---
Watch Juicehead's video called 'Why did fallout 76 have so many problems' he explains it pretty well (with a pinch of salt that kind of annoyed me, but he still told the truth) and he touches on how bethesda's future plans are fucking everything up for fo76
---
I seriously doubt it'd take anywhere near that long.
---
Also, strawman. I don't and never said I did hate content, I was suggesting a QoL improvement to the game that at least a few players would benefit from, given the frequency of posts about people being griefed for not wanting to engage in PvP, and you STILL haven't answered my question.
---
I had one drop in my 70's. Someone bought it on the market for 8k I remember. It was a tse ultracite pistol. Since then I've got a lot of two shot and exploding weapons, but no two shot exploding. I did get a stalkers exploding dragon to drop recently. That is a awesome gun for my build.
---
You're missing the whole point. It's not about keeping the workshop. It's about the claimed rewards. Now if you can claim multiple rewards from the same workshop over time then that's just a plus.
---
2 star ones I find randomly. In a 4 hour run I will hit an AWOL ARMAMENTS event and 2 Whitesprings golf club runs. There is also random Legendary spawns at Robco that I usually find when I do the AWOL event as well. 
---
No offense but if fallout has to rely on writting pages for computer terminals to captivate you, then they really should have just made a book instead
---
I spend $40 on lunch...literally stuff that I end up shitting out. Hours of enjoyment on a video game...no problem
---
They can also easily make specific skins rewards for killing certain number of bosses such as scorchbeast and the queen. People will play HARD to earn them. There are many ways to get people motivated to play and spend. Please Bethesda the various outfits and the ability to mismatch armors are great but you‚Äôve ignored the most important personalization components in a shooting game, the weapons. 
---
I thought that Bethesda stated in the last patch involving the nerf with TSE that two shot and explosive as a combined modifier will now be unobtainable? Can a community manager confirm? Cause that‚Äôs how I interpreted it.
---
Take Aqua boy off and sit in a puddle in the Toxic Valley
---
Check your INT stat - maybe your character isn't smart enough to breathe and chew bubblegum at the same time.
---
These little 'QOL' things were added in the last 'content update'.
---
You probably see a lot of those weapons only because of duping.
---
I'm lvl 117 and only found some TS and 2/3 explosives. But never a TSE
---
You and the rest of Vault 76. The other vaults that haven't yet opened. Everyone who comes after you, like your kids.
---
It is - *literally* - the reason we left the vault. To "begin anew", and rebuild/repopulate Appalachia.
---
Lvl 144 here and never found one, I'll find one or the other but never together.
---
The vendor I'm talking about does not sell furniture plans. He only has two plans and they are ALWAYS the same two plans everytime. Nuka cola clock and cuckoo clock
---
You are blocking one of X spawns, increasing the difficulty for me to find this vendor.  I will destroy your base.
---
Someone's already offered on PS4, but if by chance you're on PC I have the plans and would be happy to make you a modded up one. 
---
I think I've done every event at this point.  But it would give more variety in my daily play if 2 big ones like Queen of the Hunt and Heart of the Enemy would ever appear.  Last time I saw them was early/mid December.
---
I also like this. I appreciate games where you're just some schmuck, rather than The Chosen One. It make the arc of the character that much more satisfying when you reach that end-game God of All Things state.
---
I have had users confirm that this doesn‚Äôt block random spawns. Read the post fully.
---
I have 20 bulk ballistic fiber bundles and nothing to use them on
---
Please, bitch some more why don‚Äôt you? It‚Äôs called sourcing items
---
This.. this is exactly my view on the game. I‚Äôve got a collective 800 hours on fallout 3 NV and 4 yet I have about 15 on 76 and I havnt picked it up since
---
How does that happen? Do you accidentally deposit the wrong items in there or does the hopper literally take random items from you when depositing the food?
---
So 481 people just showed up at their office and stared at them as they left work? Is this a British thing? It is kinda... creepy...
---
/u/Ladydevann , /u/LoneVaultWanderer, and the like won't respond to things like this. They've got to keep up the illusion things are being worked on at a normal AAA pace. 
---
I can't even blame you though, it's mental that people defend it
---
Pm me the name 
---
I don't care what you spend your $40 on but you seem to be concerned that I place too much value on my $40. I'm just saying if you don't care about your money then be prepared to get taken for a ride. Are companies going to make something for $50 that needs to be good or are they going to push out some mediocre junk for $40 because people will just go 'lel that's not much money who cares?'
---
Why would I not place value on my money? Why would I not expect a certain standard in return for my money? Because you think that money is worthless?
---
Not all tse weapons one shotted. And you did have to habe perks invested to get damage. Not saying they need to be like they used to be. But they could be better
---
[Here](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
Queen has awesome drops right now if you know what you're doing. Whitesprings is still a lot of 3 star stuff but we know why that's not as good as the queen. My comp been locking up a lot though, not good for queen until I can get it sorted out. I lost 1k lead there already xD
---
And get flagged for pvp, which puts a giant neon ‚Äúgrief me‚Äù sign on your head.
---
No thanks
---
I think they patched that. You can find a friend and jump off of the Ranger watch towers. 
---
I had a similar thought and each 3 points you have into any tree grants a passive 3 rank perk card no more than 3 cause we know some op 5 star cards
---
Not all tse weapons one shotted. And you did have to habe perks invested to get damage. Not saying they need to be like they used to be. But they could be better. And and yeah the Fat man should do more along with the missile launcher and 40mm  launchers. But they nerfed all explosive/ everything
---
1. Who are you siding with? Hello no one is around....
---
2. Your companions are the other vault dwellers. You potentially have over twenty companions available to you every time you login
---
This is not Fallout 4. The PVP could be improved. As far as content goes some of us are still making our way through it. I don‚Äôt understand the logic of rushing to the end to only be bored and then complaining about being bored.
---
We always have this issue with our team on PC.
---
One man disappeared from time to time, he can saw us but we can't see him.
---
Now we don't have this issue anymore since I am the only one still playing
---
NO
---
All I've wanted since fallout 3 is a post apocalyptic mmo where I can walk the wasteland with my friends and family. Fallout 76 I thought would fulfil that dream. However my brother stopped playing first, then my two sisters, theb my partner, then my mam,and now finally I've stopped playing. The reason is bugs upon bugs, hackers, glitches and a complete mess of a game. I'm gutted to the point I wish Zenimax ran with this game instead of Bethesda. 
---
If you would have read my post properly I clearly stated my purpose was not to garner your precious attention but in hopes bethesda can see that things are deteriorating and maybe fix it.  If no one spoke up we would have battlefront 2 pay 2 win practices without hassle and bullshit that companies get away with.  Silence doesnt help
---
You could actually take 30 minutes, play for yourself, and make a decision if the game is fun to you.
---
Coming here and posting this is bait to lure out all of the negative posters who will post garbage about the game.  Only you will know if the game is fun for you.  Stop letting others tell you if something is fun, and use your own opinions.
---
That's the best place for him to spawn. Right on your bed. 
---
Oh without armor on?
---
Ok, so if **I** don't do it then what happens? Literally nothing. You said it yourself, the rest of Vault 76 is there. What is *my* motivation? I am not saving the rest of Vault 76, they are quite happy doing that themselves. I am not saving my children because there are none, which feeds back into the whole circular disaster which is that the narrative hook only exists because the player character has been created. If there was no player character there would be no impact to the wider story. Compare that to if there was no Dragonborn in Skyrim, no Hero of Time in Zelda, no Geralt in the Witcher.
---
Yeah same here.. Got so much excess
---
It would be kinda stupid if everyone was running around with the same companion. But Maybe we could have a pet companion, or maybe a Miss Nanny or Mr Handy that we can reprogram and paint and upgrade etc. That would be cool.
---
Without power armor for sure. 
---
I disagree. I think that legendary items should be things obtained as is otherwise, what you're describing is really just a rare mod effect. Not against the idea but for me doesn't sell that fantasy of some lost unique item like the sceptre of blah blah blah that's only obtainable by defeating a legendary level creature.
---
The thing that bothers me and I think the thing that'll go a long way to fixing things is that more stars doesn't necessarily mean better legendary item.
---
I'm fine with the legendary effects on the table. Some should be really good, others not so. However, I wished that the legendary effects were tiered and applied as such for the number of stars the item is. 
---
For instance, if you have a 3 star legendary effect, you're guaranteed at least 1 top tier effect (explosive, two shot, bloodied etc.), 2 star guaranteed at least 1 top or mid tier legendary effect and 1 star it can be any effect. Much the same with loot boxes or card packs, there's at least 1 guaranteed thing that's at least a decent tier or above.
---
Great catch on that pic!!!
---
I saw s diseased chameleon Deathclaw in the big last night wrecking ghouls.
---
It‚Äôs a thing for everything now.
---
My level 70, pacifist definitely on was taking an unclaimed workshop.  Some 100 player ran up and one shotted me.  I didn't know that was possible.
---
Anyone know how he was able to one shot me?  
---
Anyway corpse lay there while bozo shot at me and the surroundings.   I went and got myself a coffee - he got bored and left.  
---
*Then* I respawned, picked up my loot - and server hopped. 
---
Big Fallout fans don't buy the game months after release ! Downvote me all the way but i think the most amazing days were the first ones when nobody was high level and we all had same gear.Now you just need to make a new character and somebody will wait at the vault exit to throw stuff at you.
---
Anyone who has nodded fo4 knows the technical details, and OOP design makes things like that a breeze.
---
In any sane class based architecture you have an attack class, you create individual attacks with that using instance variables to specify details like attack animations, frequency, damage.
---
Makes that change 1 line of code. Heck you can even read all the common stuff from ini files, so no need to make code changes for simple attack parameter changes.
---
&gt; Especially the fact that there are Bethesda PR shill accounts posting in this sub making the game seem like it‚Äôs something it really isn‚Äôt
---
So, do you have even the thinnest shread of evidence to suggest this? Because IMO this is the funniest and most illogical thing ever and keep seeing it brought up in a serious context. I feel that that is an unreasonably huge stretch and you are just slapping a shill label on anyone with opinions that contradict what you think about the game and bethesda... It really just reads as a scapegoat to further vilify both the company and the people who don't share your outrage without any sort of actual context besides the fact that it was relevant and a problem in the election cycle so it is also bad when involved with something you don't like. 
---
I got a toothbrush
---
If you can‚Äôt defend your workshop from a scorchbeast then how the hell are you gonna defend it when I come through at lvl 240 with full pvp gear and blow a hole in you with my bloodied handmade?
---
Just move your CAMP stash/module(the item you place down when you decide where you want your CAMP) and it will change the CAMP's spawn location. 
---
Now before people say it doesnt help, from my personal testing, its more about where you fast travel FROM. So for example: if you fast travel to your camp from whitesprings you will be sonwhere different than if you fast travel from watoga. Again though, these are just my personal findings. Theres a few other variables im working out, and am even considering doing an in depth write up over everything ive found if anyone might be interested in it. If you guys are interested, just comment and let me know and ill get working on it. Otherwise, ill just base it off my karma from this post lol. 
---
Nah there was a sneaky nerd in a early patch that made cores from their original 12/hr to 1/hr. So it was not worth it to go through the trouble and easier to farm bots. But now they boosted the rate back up.
---
Damn it. HOW do I get the last bench variant that looks like an old park bench and the metal picnic table. I have been to every vendor except that one. I am desperate to get those last two plans. Will pay good caps, chems, mags, mats, whatever is needed. PC here. 
---
They "fixed" this weeks ago.  :(
---
Where is the second entrance? Further east? Is it worth looking through or no? I‚Äôve only been over there once and that‚Äôs when I got distracted by Tanagra town. 
---
Definitely serums, you can buy them from players for ~200 caps, or you can buy the serums or the recipes from the modus vendor in the Whitesprings Bunker
---
Don't link that sub willy nilly otherwise the negative nancies will start posting there instead of here, just like how they migrated from the main fallout sub to this one. 
---
This is how they should've started it. it would've been easier to maintain, duppers wouldn't have been half as much trouble considering, they also would've had more time to create content instead of fighting to force so much on an engine that wasnt designed to handle it. I wouldn't have even minded a smaller map if it meant stability and quality. 
---
From a Legendary creature
---
And what makes it worse for me, there‚Äôs some other quest that does the same, it results in everyone getting the ‚Äúcorpse flower stamen‚Äù I think it is, they didn‚Äôt fix that shit, cause nobody fucking cared nobody does that mission, nobody cares about the result, so it‚Äôs still there.   But the feeding the people mission, the one way you can actually help other people in game they kill that dead 
---
All it needed was ‚Äú&lt;player name&gt; has fed the people, enjoy the canned meat stew‚Äù message when everyone got the rewards, and then it was an ok mission that put your name up as a good guy, exactly what I wanted out of this game and can not get.  
---
Once again the sub running wild with unsubstantiated info like the "trading bug".
---
&gt; Though I think ultimately if the victim calls it griefing, then sadly griefing it is.
---
No, that is just people being whiners.  Griefing isn't even possible in a game like this, it is naive to think that way.  The best experience I had in the game so far was my first nuke launch.  Two other people went in to the silo right after me and we kind of silently agreed to do it together since they were partied and couldn't talk to me, all of us around the same level.  When we were about 3/4s of the way through, I killed them both so I could do the nuke myself (they had both already accidentally hit me clearing out the bots because I was melee'ing the bots.) They kept coming back the whole time for revenge, I ended up killing them both maybe 5 times and felt like I really earned that nuke by the end
---
Well to be honest I despise how much thought and time that needs to go into food and water. That specific aspect of the game is not enjoyable for me. I understand the idea of realism, I also would rather not ever have to give it a thought or a single ounce of my storage space.
---
Yes, are you American ? You voted in Mr Creepy and you can say that ? Perhaps you can do better ? But I know you won't as your living the dream, being a keyboard warrior. As in your eyes, Trolling is the thing that brings you the most pleasure, rather than actually doing something 
---
I traded my first one, then found a exp radium at a vendor only paid 170 caps for it, got a explosive gauss from *** nuke zone, got a explosive pipe gun from sbq yesterday and somehow dropped it, was upset so i spent all my caps and bought a instigating shotgun  
---
You just moan on here, when your Mum is dying of Cancer, you send emails ? 
---
Awesome drops such as 1* lead pipes and drills.
---
Is it possible their coding is really unoptimized and hard to dig through and the team working on it now is unfamiliar (because I think it‚Äôs a different team than that made the game that‚Äôs working on bugs)?  Making what should be easy harder. This is not snarky sarcasm I‚Äôm genuinely curious because I don‚Äôt know much about programming 
---
Ever heard of google. Lazy ass
---
95,000 posts and you've actually posted another. Did you get up in the last hour ? Or did Mummy get your dinner ? 
---
The green colored bench?
---
I fully agree with this it sucks having to choose between gunsmith,Armorer, Hacking, Locksmith, etc. 
---
I rushed and accidentally deposited all my 305 ammo and it magically disappeared :(
---
You angry bro?
---
I hear ya.  I understand the idea but the implementation is tedious at times.  My character should be one fat cunt the amount they eat. 
---
I've gotten two, one being a Gatling plasma and the other being a lever action. The Gatling was in the Watoga bot and the lever action was in the Harper's ferry bot
---
Some do. It was a challenge for me. I didn't have all that on start. But if they have the set up to do it, Doesn't bother me
---
Nobody cares, please stop. It‚Äôs not a great game, but a lot of time and effort was put in.You aren‚Äôt going to get your money back or make the game better by making this post. I understand you don‚Äôt like it but still.
---
Yes please.
---
Anyone that needs a few steaks an hour is one beefy dude for sure. They going to have to add insulin soon.
---
Dudes into floppy grandma titties. No surprise here
---
Radios were removed too. I had one in my shack during the beta, but after release I couldn't find it in the menus anywhere.
---
Where the fuck are we? Who are you?
---
I think you misunderstand what I meant, my apologies. 
---
What I meant is not based on intention, it‚Äôs based on reception and interpretation. 
---
If you do that to someone, and they take it as griefing, then they may report you for griefing. If it is then interpreted as griefing by the admin reviewing the report, you may be penalised for griefing. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs how it works in Fallout 76 pvp, as I tend to avoid pvp. It is not naive of me to say what I said, it is naive of you to think that your intentions would be considered as evidence in this sort of hypothetical situation. It‚Äôs a coin toss these days with radicalised social justice encroaching on behavioural policy.
---
I've never traded with anyone and have no desire to, but I was given one for free by a friend of a friend.
---
Gave it away after a few days.
---
You dont have to cross the bridge just step on it and look to the shed you see the random spawn
---
No, you just have to have played older fallouts. Got some awesome stuff off queen, like serum recipes and exploding weapons.
---
What? You're a character that is claiming stupidity but is "really ducking stupid" themselves. How is that NOT irony?
---
That‚Äôs what you want anyway for it to die 
---
Avoid any area on Xbox that has more than you in it. Servers go in to meltdown. Lag is sadly here to stay on Xbox if you love playing with your friends or going in to zones where there are others.

 It's why I play alone now. But that's getting so boring 
---
yea back at about lvl 70 i found a tse western revolver  then later i found a mutants explosive pump shotgun but the revolver is only tse i have found at lvl 275 and now they are both pretty much useless went back to melee like i started with before i found the pistol

Hmmm calls people poor then talks about wishing he could have gotten a deduction for buying game interesting. Personally clicked to see how you were trying to commit tax fraud üòÑ

I was thinking the same thing.

  Camps as a mobile working base is great idea, until you begin to feel like your camp is 'home' and you don't want to uproot yourself.

My camp is in a safe, scenic area, it's furnished and cozy -  and at the end of the day,  I want to go home and relax.

Three games later I'm still never quite sure whether the beginning beats of "Mr. Sandman" isn't something approaching me from behind (I'm a stealther nowadays, so that's usually the only possibility). That's the one song that ALMOST annoys me as much as "Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition." As there's STILL a perk named for it, I wasn't surprised to hear it in this game too.
---
The game has been out for like 3 months. It's not a rush to be at the end by now
---
Called rage quitting

It started with a monthly "round up" of bugs and QoL issues / suggestions but quickly hit the character limited.   
---
Then started posting more issues people mentioned, and I figured while I posted them, the least I could do is see if I could find a fix or two, and well, for some issues I have.   
---
Some are 100% concrete (missing keywords, broken leveled lists).  
---
Some are theoretical, I can replicate the condition, and the solution in FO4 (core part of '76's foundation) but need to be replicated in the '76 sandbox by the Dev's.  
---
It's gotten larger enough I'm making separate pages for each group of issues, both due to character limitations but also for easier reading 
---
Every time walking through or near Morgantown.
---
"Calling all responders it's Sanjay here!"
---
Gets on my nerves lol
---
Still works for me bahaha
---
Since you apparently don't know what a cash grab actually is, the cash grab was the $60 price tag for a game that would be a hard argue was even in alpha phase levels of development, which was 100% a successful cash grab 
---
The garbage atom shop is merely enough to pay for the servers and keep a couple people for the mentioned skeleton crew
---
F76 was a success and they made money
---
Then why not say those all need to be buffed instead of just complaining about TSE only?
---
I found mine at a legendary Death Claw some time ago. I had no idea how powerful it was until much later I just knew it was my "oh shit" weapon. Then the TSE thing became more and more and realized I had an amazing find. Damn I with my harpoon gun still actually killed stuff.
---
Like many large companies, each part of the company is atleast partially walled off from the other parts...  
---
The community managers can pass information up, but don't really have a direct line to the Dev's like use to exist... No more walking over to someone's desk and having a chat, as I understand it
---
I could provide further insight- bear with me but definitely open for discussion.  Advertising and public relations companies are very popular for doing this, hiring people as brand ambassadors to promote their brand through various social media platforms. public relations companies do this to promote, save, defend a brands image. Obviously FO76 has been in a bad state since launch and it would make sense for Bethesda PR to salivate, save, and defend their image. Why this tactic is good? Because you can create numerous accounts and to save your companies image but they‚Äôre hard to decipher from regular people most of the time. 
---
The screen shots I have are account like 30 days old, their only posts are in FO76 and miraculously positive with 1,000-2,000 upvotes. If you follow this sub enough you can pick up the trends. Of course it could just happen to be a person that only posted in FO76 and only comments positive things in FO76. But the chances of these posts are not being shill accounts are unlikely. A lot of the posts are crafted in a way that‚Äôs out of the ordinary for posting in this thread, and then it just takes off with upvotes for visibility. 
---
Why are people still asking questions here???
---
You realize after a while that all the CMs are ignoring or at least don't post in threads like these and focus more on the happy positive ones.
---
You're part of the problem if you think stuff like this helps. 
---
I once got a Screwdriver from the Queen
---
Go to westec and collect lots of toxic goo under the contamination shower, then go back to your camp and drink, you have to remove starched genes 
---
It's a feature ü§£
---
That's where i keep my camp usually at since it's a nice spot
---
&gt; button doesn't activate
---
I was trying to complete every event in the game, and this one was last for me, it seems incredibly rare to trigger (at least for me).  I finally see it, fast travel with only 10 seconds to start the event.  Sprint to the pole, start spamming the button on the pole...  nothing happens.  Event disappears :'(  Turns out the speaker on the other side of the pole from the button is what you press to 'activate the lure'.  Not that which is clearly a switch for turning things on or off.   nice.
---
I usually start with MODUS, then the Whitespring, after that I go to Watoga, Harpers Ferry, across to Pleasant Valley(top of the world) and then Flatwoods or Morgantown.
---
Did you have a pet that died?
---
If you're playing on PC, I wouldn't mind letting go of my Critical .38 Receiver plan for, say, 750 caps? I also have a Precise .50 cal plan if you missed that one, as well.
---
Are you referring to Rose's quest line? I'm level 69, and completed her quests during beta, but sped through them. I don't remember the signs for the different raiders, so didn't recognize this one. 
---
The system in itself is completly retardo. I played to level 60 and saw 3-4 legendaries and I wholeheartedly refuse to "farm" whitespring because its really not fun at all.
---
I have no idea why they didn't introduce new mechanics or even crafting/crafting components in this game. 
---
This would do a lot to reduce loot disappointment, for sure. If they fixed what you mentioned about the tiers, as well as removed certain items from the legendary loot table, *and* made items drop at your level (or just always drop at max level if you're over level 50).... that would be a huge improvement.
---
On top of that, if legendary enemies were more "spread out" and spawned more reliably throughout the world, it could reduce zone farming substantially.  For example, what if every Event and every Workshop defense was guaranteed to spawn a legendary foe? Always at least a 1\*, occasionally a 2\*, and rarely a 3\*.  
---
You touched on something else I hadn't really considered; the difference between "legendary" and "rare" effects.  I think I'm used to other RPG style games where "legendary" are named and have fixed stats.  That's true of some of the legendary weapons in FO76 as well, such as All Rise or Somerset Special. It would be interesting to see what happened if they added more of these "Named Legendaries" to the game.  I think that would help with "selling" the fantasy of finding some lost unique item, as you aptly put it.
---
Yep, this is all correct.
---
&gt;A week to reroll the last 3 patches and fix one issue with reintroducing all the old ones
---
ftfy.
---
I just did the same recently, I got rid of 3 turrets to make my farm bigger and could only add around  12 plants. So I scrapped the plants and could only rebuild 2 turrets and I was full
---
This this this, Just hand over the damn game to the fans and let them fix it like every other FO game you ever released Beth
---
Oh yeah. I never said they thought it through. 
---
If you search through the camp related posts there are a number of outstanding issues, especially linked to storing and placing a camp.  
---
Sometimes the only fix is scrapping everything, placed or in storage, logging out, back in and moving the camp
---
Okay
---
yup, just keep shrugging off criticism as bandwagoning. see how far that gets ya.
---
That's probably not a bad guess.
---
Since we know that there were multiple studios involved, there might been many of whom have moved on to other stuff in their own studio.
---
It‚Äôs not a static spawn that I have seen.
---
Charlosten Station, Sutton Station, White Spring Station + Bunker, Harpers Ferry, Watoga Shopping Center, Watoga Station that one i got from a Youtube video and is quite nice.
---
Only to repair.
---
Refreshing positivity for once. I want to see more posts like this 
---
In a game this poorly designed and thought out, are you really looking at story continuity?
---
I mean, they can‚Äôt even figure out that a .50 caliber does more damage than a .308 .
---
If you want to scratch your head your about something, start there.
---
If I start the game at my CAMP I fall through the world, and occasionally take the falling damage from it and die.
---
I honestly cant belive people are still playing this garbage.
---
The jump scares from the actual creatures or the bugs and game breaking glitches? The glitches never cease to amaze me haha always something new to find.
---
Nope just everyone jumping ship

It‚Äôs kinda like when you‚Äôre depositing stuff in your stash or at a trade window and after you click one item suddenly the list starts shifting around in inexpected ways and you end up clicking another item that you didn‚Äôt mean to click. As I was clicking to quickly deposit all the vegetable mix stuff suddenly the list rearranged and for some reason .308 ammo was at the top the list! Before I even knew what happened I had clicked it and boom, it was all gone forever.
---
In a successful online game, the ‚Äúmicro‚Äù-transactions are supposed to bring in way more money than the upfront cost. It‚Äôs more miney for less work if people are willing to buy a single skin for 18$
---
If this was meant to be shoved out and forgotten, they would have made it an offline game. But no, this was supposed to be a perpetual money machine, but it has failed because their customer-base (f76 players) is too small because of the game‚Äôs many issues.
---
Having played older fallouts has nothing to do with it. You sound like a complete moron.
---
P.S I have thousands of hours in the older fallouts
---
Yeah I've had this problem it's like the game can't count initially have to get 6 more than what it says it need to do the thing.
---
I always end up on a cliff above my camp, right on the edge which I sometimes fall off and die on or below the cliff my camp is located and I have run a lot to reach my camp because I need to run around the mountain. 
---
That one really blew me away.   With a title of "Feed the People," it made sense for everyone on the server to get a reward.  It was a fun little thing about that quest.  Now?  Meh.   Just like any of the other boring ass events.   
---
I can give you one if your on PC 
---
It would be pretty easy to allow crafting to proc legendaries, as the laziest approach to this (grind for material, grind for the proc when crafting). Even better would be to allow you to socket items with specific modifiers. And a gold star if you can balance that against DPS. Maybe you want a weapon that has no extra mods but 3x the DPS instead. Then you can fix the economy with real crafting if they ever stop the duping.
---
The state of the game pretty well forces you to either melee or snipe now thanks to the nerf they gave zero thought to, prior to implementing.  If they can't even figure out how to balance the weapons in this game, the state of legendaries is kind of meaningless in my opinion. I'm checking in vain for some indication that they are going to enhance ranged weapons and explosives or acknowledge their mistake. Stupid, I know.
---
Mmmmm cornsoup and dogfood. A perfect meal.
---
Are you wanted? I've full servers for days.
---
Thx I‚Äôm on Xbox tho :/
---
Same thing happened to me last night. Couldn't damage that griefer even in vats critical until I switch to a differnt gun. Not sure what happens there. 
---
That was my primary source of screws in FO4...
---
Ouch! Double whammy.
---
It does though. If you've played you'd know how to do it.
---
Yep, 900 is fine! PM me when you're on.
---
Maybe some will emerge from a vault.
---
What ending? Derp.
---
Things aren't always as simple to add as they seem to be, even if they added in the ability to set your own spawn there would still be issues.  
---
When you log in at your camp the fast travel point is used as your spawn point. But your camp doesn't start loading in until after you, so even if you were able to set your own fast travel point depending on where you place it you can still end up where you don't want to, i.e. if you place it over water, off the ground, on a platform over a cliff etc you're still going to end up inside a structure, in the water or falling to the ground.  I haven't fast traveled since the beta so I don't know if this also applies to when an exterior cell loads each time someone gets close enough to it or anything.
---
To get this to really work they'd have to redesign how you and you camp load into a world so that your camp always loads first which is a lot more complicated than "just put the rug back in".
---
Since there isn't a mechanic to prevent you from accidentally selling prized items, I use skins to ensure they don't get sold by my own fat fingering or server lag. Sad to have to pay atoms for a simple feature they left out. 
---
We appreciate the suggestion and will pass this along to the dev team
---
aka no
---
Oh wow people still play this? :'(
---
this post wins
---
 Port to the Vault. Start at Grafton Station and do Grafton and others south as needed. Then Sutton Station has the first Raider vendor, there are more to the east. South continues the Responder network mostly.
---
 Now it depends what you are doing at this point. If all you want is to make caps then you should have 400 now. If you are looking for stuff continue south, If just caps go to The Whitespring for 200 more and the Enclave bunker for another 200. We have 800 caps now.
---
 There are 3 more. The Watoga Station guy. Phoenix in Watoga and Wallace in Harper's Ferry. ;) The last 2 are BOS and Free States.
---
The whole premise is helping fellow Vault 76 dwellers as you all go out into the wasteland.  The intent was that we would all team up, choose a faction and role play it.  *WE* the players were/are supposed to be those people.  But if you play in a single player mindset, of course you feel like there is no people.
---
On the downside of the game, the assumption/gamble that Bethesda made was that the players would see it that way.  Some of them did, most of them are still treating 76 like a single player game and refusing to interact with other players who are "in their way."
---
I'm not discounting the fact that the story is weak.  It is.  But, it's also not as bad as people make it.
---
&gt;  I still watch the forums in morbid curiosity now and then. 
---
You and me both!  I haven't played since that shitty Dec patch.   I guess I mainly keep coming around here to see a "They finally fixed it!" type of post.   I hear Conan Exiles has turned around dramatically since release, and I keep hoping these devs can do that.  I mean, THEY SHOULD be able to, considering the backing this game has, but it's not looking like it.  Each patch just reads worse and worse.  Nothing I read makes me go "Oh, I should log in and check this out!"   Nothing.   
---
Awesome!!
---
I end up in the middle of a nearby pond collecting RADs. Lately, I'll still be in the middle of the pond, but standing on the water as if I'm Jesus.

---
 Don't think you even realise what  u sound like. People are just asking you genuine questions 
---
Shit, I'd love to read a fallout book, haha but I get your point.
---
Send him to my camp, my mothman sleeping bag should calm him down.
---
I had an empty server last night. To be fair I was playing at 3am though 
---
Ah ok
---
Well I could just tell you but I don't think it'd help you to be honest. First you lie if you say you've played older fallouts. Well I gouess you could be telling the truth, but that'd mean you were probably a cheater xD How did you get those awesome weapons to drop in even fo4? Think about it.
---
It's alright though because they never existed anyway. 76 is just another vault running an experiment where the dwellers are in virtual reality to simulate what they would do if they finally left the vault ‚óâ_‚óâ
---
And for the Powered Doors, how about just make them be *doors,* not walls*.*  Get rid of the wall part and let us place them in whatever doorway wall we want.  
---
Hell, that could work for the Garage doors too; just widen them so they take up the full width of 2 foundations and don't have any visible "wall" texture on them at all.
---
Oh, and add doorway wall variants that have the door opening on the left sides and right sides.
---
People already shit themselves with rage each time the Atom Shop updates and that's just with the stuff they've likely had done since before launch that has been releasing on schedule.  Even if the team that works on Atom Shop assets had absolutely nothing to do with producing the patches people would start a lynch mob if Bethesda even suggested they were working on new things to add to the shop even if it's at player request.
---
You sound like the keyboard warrior here dude. 
---
Only time I jumped was two days ago when a mute Scorchbeast slammed into the ground right in front of me. At level 27 that's a big no-no.
---
Grafton Station can sell it, along with a whole bunch of other plans
---
Msg one of the rage quitters on Reddit and offer 5 bucks plus postage for the disc.
---
It‚Äôs 5 more than they have right now, so should work in theory.
---
&gt; But now they boosted the rate back up.
---
Still below that of the original value, iirc.
---
Because we were shown in fallout 3 and 4 that virtual reality was totally a thing before the war, I am not convinced that everyone and everything in 76 is real. How do we know we are not sitting in the vault, hooked up to a virtual reality machine and really, this is all just another Vault experiment
---
&gt; What I meant is not based on intention, it‚Äôs based on reception and interpretation.
---
It is though, you can't just claim someone was trying to grief if their intent was to roleplay as a raider that is idiotic.
---
Picking up weights is a terrible way to get lead. Put on excavator armour and go to lucky hole mine. One run will get you about 450 lead in less than 1/2 hour.
---
I made an alt character specifically to buy the plans when appropriately low-leveled. Grinded through the first 10-15 levels, and I was just on the verge of hiking across to the Mire when they updated how/where plans were available.  Ah damn. 
---
Used my main to buy the plans right away, and now I gotta figure out how I want to use my alt now. Maybe he‚Äôll be a shopkeeper specializing in death tambos and nuka grapes?
---
Nice to see some actual history. Interesting read, thanks!
---
And now I just realized, it's JuiceHead! I hope you include more gaming and games industry history lessons in your videos. :)
---
Yes. All of this.
---
F for respect
---
Lol wood armor nation lets goooo
---
We don't want you anyway, so don't start playing again please.
---
There are a few safe areas: Whitespring Resort, Enclave Bunker, the HQ of the BoS,HQ of the Mistress of Mysteries, and maybe more I have yet to find
---
No not really, its just changing a value, if that sort of data wasn't moved "server side" a mod would be out for it already.  They would have had to go through a lot of trouble to make it so complicated someone unfamiliar couldn't figure it out in a very short time.
---
Not gone, unfortunately. I get these even with single foundation CAMPs
---
A refund
---
Well I'm 300hrs in and still finding new locations. 
---
Not everyone is required to like/not like the same things. If you didn't like it before you won't like it now
---
I started playing 3 weeks ago &amp; it has never synched my friends list I can join invites if I look at map for name
---
The idiots who played over $100 for a bag are the biggest vocal critics of the game. Dont get me wrong some elements of the game are buggy and sometimes you get ejected from the server for no reason but holy fuck is this game ever addicting. 
---
I have a 1GB by 1GB fiber optic internet there is no EXCUSE for this to happen.
---
Why do you assume this isn't intended? It's a mechanically operated gun. MA makes you swing your limbs faster. Makes sense to me.

I see you to are a scholar and gentleman üòÜ hurr hurr
---
I personally never have an issue with mats for guns and armour I don‚Äôt even use white knight just one luck of the draw and one luck break keeps me doing one or two repairs a week
---
I will fiddle with your new settings the next time I'll play!
---
So this sub has gotten to the point that a post telling devs to go fuck themselves sits on the homepage? Brutal.
---
I acknowledge the shitty parts of the game, vigorously complain about them at hope the dev's are doing something, and enjoy the good parts
---
Playing with my friends helps tremendously 
---
\^Take their advice
---
‚Ä¶..I have the Daisy cutter next time I think I will just stand back a bit and start flinging nukes around.
---
This happened to me once but I was able to re-equip it. Ymmv. Best of luck
---
How about a legendary fridge?
---
This is the most helpful post ever. Thank you!!!
---
When they included the Beach Boys' "Wouldn't It Be Nice?" they really should've added "Sweet Janet" by the Velvet Underground.
---
Some people prefer to play solo, there's absolutely no problem with that and it's literally a recognized playstyle by the devs. There's even a perk for it, Line Wanderer. Saying "just play in a team" is an absolutely horrible answer for this game. Co-op should be optional, not mandatory, and if it becomes mandatory everyone who prefers to play solo deserves a full refund.
---
According to data mining, they could drop from deathclaws, or randomly in Ash Heap. Take that with a grain of salt, I've been looking and haven't had any luck yet.
---
It‚Äôs not a too-mah 
---
Good answer
---
BGSA is not an inexperienced team.  Before BGSA and BattleCry, a lot of their team worked on other multiplayer online games like Star Wars Galaxies, SWTOR, etc.  They definitely have what it takes to make 76 great.
---
I love finding weird legendary enemies. Killed a legendary mole rat- was hoping for some legendary mole rat teeth I could maybe add as a mod to a melee weapon or something :p
---
Anything.ingame to suggest anyone in ‚Äòthe wasteland‚Äô is alive to be saved from infection?
---
I just ‚Äúdug them up‚Äù in one of the treasures

Was the Mire treasure map #5
---
Probably nothing, not unless the prices become more reasonable. Nothing is worth what they're asking. If I can't earn it I'm probably not paying for it. 
---
Personally I always wanted to fight large boss versions of the cryptids in the game with their own special attacks. I feel like they really missed out on a cool opportunity here with all the ones involved with West Virginia.
---
The flatwoods monster could summon a UFO or maybe open a portal for little alien bois to come out? Mothman could  be much larger and spawn eggs you had to kill quickly or would hatch other tiny mothmen? Etc
---
I feel like theres just so much they could do and add a couple flavored mechanics to each of them and it would go such a long way. 
---
Maybe I'm alone here but my absolute favorite thing in games is boss fights with a specific mechanic that you can't ignore - I find the scorchbeast queen very annoying because she's very bland in terms of her abilities. 
---
I think I am going to start making it not so fun for people to do this I am going to stack items around the workbench so that they have to get a bounty to claim it.
---
If vaults open and the first thing they encountered was the disease, they would die
---
Damn. I'm on ps4 but thanks. 
---
The thing is, Bethesda (and most big companies, I think) can act as a part of the community which cares about gamers and games, but it's just words. 
---
The bitter truth is, they are a huge corporation, hundreds of employees and billions of dollars. There might be some devs there, who are truly passionate about games, but they are not making decisions. Big bosses do, and big bosses don't give a shit about how much you love Fallout franchise or what this game means to you. They do not see it as a piece of art, or as a game, or as a community. For them it's just a product which can be sold, nothing more. In there eyes you are not a veteran who remembers every bloody NPC in Fallout 1, you're just another customer, just another $60 income. 
---
You know when I fully realized it? When some another company announced price changing for some in-game goods. They clearly rised the prices, yet they never used the word. Prices were "changed". And they only included new prices in the blog post, not the old ones. Community managers can talk all they want about relationships and fanbase and communication, but this one ugly post crossed all of it. In the end, we are just customers who can be manipulatred and who are stupid enough to be fooled by this "changing" of prices. 
---
Thus said, it's pointless to plea, or demand, or ask for anything. They make you think they care about you, but they really don't. 
---
*They speak about trust*  
---
*But make no mistake*  
---
*They're shaking your hand*  
---
*But they spit in your face*
---
On a slightly related note:
---
I'm level 69, haven't killed the Scorched Beast Queen yet, the main quest sucks and haven't reached that point yet. Had no clue i can join the fight before finishing the quest...
---
Currently i can deal with regular Scorched Beasts without any problems, it just feels like a waste of time since they don't drop anything nice otherwise i would grind the stupid things.
---
Anyway my question is how's the Scorched Beast Queen experience as a rifle user? I got all the nice rifle damage/anti armor/crits/vats perks. Is the ammo drain as bad as it is for automatic rifles users? Do i need to be prepared with chems and all of that stuff? Or anything i should be aware of? 
---
Based on LinkedIn, looks like at least 79 in BGSA.
---
I would agree, but from my perspective I want new content, not improvements. 
---
Stopped playing on thursday and have nothing to go back for. I'm not in any way special, so if I feel that way, I imagine a load of others will too, especially as I didn't put a huge amount of hours in. There might be a few interesting locations I haven't seen (and almost certainly some less interesting ones) but there's nothing (either story-wise or gameplay wise) driving me to see them.
---
First insult everyone and then ask them for their opinion. What a great way open up a conversation.
---
You're not satisfied with this game? Totally fine, go play something that suits you more, but for f\*cks sake, don't throw up your frustration on us.
---
&gt;The idiots who played over $100 for a bag are the biggest vocal critics of the game. 
---
Nobody paid $100 for a bag, it was $200 and part of a larger package. The issue is less the bag and more the complete disregard for fans on Bethesda's part. It was false advertising, plain and simple. They swapped to a cheaper material without changing advertising or notifying anyone. If you seriously think this is in any way acceptable you are an blind fanboy and your opinion is completely invalid. In no way were their actions even remotely excusable.
---
I do enjoy the game but Bethesda has not been transparent at all, even now they make secret changes in patches that continue to cause controversy.
---
Honest mistake. I've committed new code to the wrong branch before. The bad part is how it made it past whatever QA process they have.
---
You're right, things are never as simple as they seem like they should be. Thank you for pointing that out, it's easy to forget.  
---
The problem you outlined applies if you load into a world for the first time at your CAMP, but not if you spawn in anywhere else in the world.  Perhaps the workaround then is, if you spawn in at your camp upon joining a server, it uses the nearest location marker to determine your spawn location.  But, after that, it uses your Fast Travel Target.  That's how Workshops work; if you don't built a Fast Travel Target, it uses the location fast travel point.
---
Found my 3* anti armor one on the deathclaw at the whitespring
---
Yes, it is idiotic. I wouldn‚Äôt personally do that, but never the less it is important to remember that possibility whilst playing a raider. 
---
Or don‚Äôt, and write an angry post on reddit about how *some little bitch who reported you for playing as a raider*, and *Bethesda banned you*, and *you‚Äôre not playing anymore and getting a refund and starfield is going to suck*.
---
Had mine get stuck multiple times for 5 minutes before loading into worlds
---
I got the game on the first day...?
---
Leech off some high levels
---
They need to stop making their games shallower and shallower. That's the real problem. Each iteration that's come out since Morrowind has been LESS filled with choice, more streamlined and less complex than the last.
---
Ive found a few at the golf club. 
---
It's only good for a short burst of high damage. You still have to rely on other weapons after. Whether it's multiple scorch or a scorchbeast. But I'm only swapping between 3 flintlock weapons.
---
I mean a robot companions 
---
You were trying to cross the border, right?
---
I'm the same, but just wanted to kinda do a straw poll and see what others thought. I have given all the cash I ever will give at this point after 20 years of buying BGS's games and DLC.
---
No Idea, I have a level 35 two shot rifle that does a base of 71 damage, two of the rifle perks with a point, the third with two, Tank Killer maxed, and Bloody Mess with two points in it. Any help would be appreciated.  
---
It's hard to imagine a more useless type of post
---
Use a perk to cripple, and equip the concentrated fire VATS skill, and target their wings. That should help them to land sooner. Then when they land headshot them with VATS or power attacks with melee. Also get Dense chest mod as it will make their sonic attacks barely tickle.
---
I agree, fool me once, shame on you, fool me...uh three times, shame on me.
---
You are correct i am wanted think i looted something that was owned by someone,but i wasnt wanted for so long now i think i could see people on the map before when i had the "wanted"sign,did they change something?or was it always like that and i didnt pay attention to it?
---
Whatttt.  I killed hundreds of glowing ones by now and have not gotten any good weapons from them.  
---
It‚Äôs a shame because the concept and actual story of the main quest is better than both 3 and 4 but like you said it falls apart without people to talk to. 
---
&gt; Or don‚Äôt, and write an angry post on reddit about how some little bitch who reported you for playing as a raider, and Bethesda banned you, and you‚Äôre not playing anymore and getting a refund and starfield is going to suck.
---
Yeah I really don't see Bethesda banning people for playing the game as intended, this sub is a vocal minority of people who think the game revolves around flowers and friendship when it is actually a nuclear wasteland and the game encourages you to nuke the shit out of each other literally.
---
 There are no companions... everyone plays for them self and not to side with anyone...
---
Reddit is using google dipshit
---
Hahaha oh man that's harsh.
---
Okay I'll revise my statement. Anyone who pays over 200 for a game is an idiot. 
---
Ya, can be a pain, and the SB bit is weird, last 4 logins I've been attacked by triple level 80 SB's inside of 5 minutes.  
---
First 2 times I'll chalk up to bad luck, last 2... Getting weird.  
---
I can kill them just fine, but it's annoying as hell until I ground them all
---
... and that's what we call a backhanded compliment
---
I think that you are giving yourself a bit too much credit.
---
'game engine is broken' is demonstrable false, where is would be more accurate to say that it is clunky and could use an update. You make many hasty generalizations that are infact debunked by a simple 'i enjoy the game'. Sorry if argumentation/logic is not your strong suit, keep studying (or lay off the 420) and maybe you will get it.
---
People don't seriously engauge with you because you are obviously trolling, seemingly on a mission to spoil people's fun. You can be how you want to be... But if your are not having fun it is on you.
---
Mine was still loading the tips at the bottom of the screen but it only loaded the tips and the other spinning thing in the bottom right.

25K a piece of its 3 star.

The story should have taken a different road. Let my explain: i am fine with people been dead when i exit the vault. Let me do generic quests to find out what happened. But then... Dont let me join all the factions at once.... After doing a couple of easy ones for every faction, the story should be divided in to different paths.. choose who you wanna be.. an enclave agent, a bos soldier or a responder ? Then give us quests specific for the path we chose. Even if the final solution is the nukes, there should be different incentives for each faction. And if you wanna try the different paths, just roll an alt. Or give us quests to betray our faction and join another. By joining a faction all the quests for that faction would have a different meaning since now you are not just helping dead people, you are promoting your faction against the others. Maybe even give benefits to the leading faction each week (not game breaking ones tho). I dont know, maybe you ll find my opinion silly but i think it would have given much depth to the story and it would be very easy to expand it to both PvP and pve content

The abandoned bog building has a floor with 10 fans and typewriters.

The Owl + X-01 combination fits pretty well in that image.
---
I supported creation club content, thought it was a little overpriced still but I bought almost everything, but $5-10 for a single cosmetic item is ridiculous. I would consider purchasing atoms if I was really close to something I really wanted. After seeing the gold .44 I'd love a silver one, but I wouldn't pay full price for it. I'd only pay for a handful of atoms if I was short.
---
Harper‚Äôs ferry bot?  As in the Free State vendor? 
---
That's what I'm saying! IF THERE WAS a full studio working on this, I'm relatively sure it wouldn't take two weeks to break stealth, and another hopefully 2 or 3 weeks to correct it. These are the things other online games handle with a horrid within hours. The whole thing screams of one or two stragglers trying to pick up the pieces in their spare time.
---
Good addition to the post mate.
---
None of us knew the demolition expert was going to get a nerf. They could have just left demolition expert alone. They don't have to be what they used to be just better than they are. Tse was just the best combo to have it with. In general yes, your right. The explosive needs the buff
---
I‚Äôm going to reiterate the word **hypothetical** and stop replying now. Talking to you has been a little like banging my head against a wall. You don‚Äôt seem to understand that I‚Äôm agreeing with you at all.
---
I would love some more transparency as well.
---
That does pain me. 
---
This game isn‚Äôt worth a fucking dime. That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt wait for it to go free to play. 
---
And given Bethesda‚Äôs track record so far, the only thing they‚Äôll put real effort in is microtransactions     Just accept it. BSG is becoming EA. 
---
I'm level 66 and I have yet to encounter any mutations. I haven't seen serums at all. I'm completely confused on the subject - is it part of the storyline at all? 
---
&gt;Farming is not that time consuming or that hard to do...
---
Not Hard to do? I agree with. Not time consuming? That's where yer wrong, bucko.
---
Ballistic fiber is easier to find than people try to make it, you're almost guaranteed to get a few at any military installation and even if that fails you can buy it in bulk from vendors.  Just from picking up the occasional junk I have over 200 of the damn things and counting taking up space in my stash and I haven't even been farming it.
---
Yeah. 
---
Agreed I don‚Äôt even wear personal armor anymore I just wear power armor at all times
---
Yeah, but we only HAVE speculation anyway. Do you really think it would take a FULL STUDIO 2 weeks just to break stealth mechanic, and then 2 (or 3 or 4) weeks to hopefully get it working again?
---
Always been like that.  Wanted players cannot see other non wanted players on the map.  
---
So make one like that. Make a fo76builds subreddit
---
I got that achievement by having a friend jump off a cliff and I would revive him. I paid him 11 magazines which he needed for his achievement. 
---
I think at first it was announced that it would no longer be dropped but later recalled that statement.  
---
D:
---
Just general fallout content, not negative feedback.
---
I quit this bullshit game long time ago now I‚Äôm just playing APEX fuk yeah
---
Lord have mercy " Loot system like Diablo" Y'all are nucking futs.  Last thing we need is Diablo anything in this game.  You wanna fix the legendary system?  How bout revert the shit changes they made to it in the first place?  And idk maybe take care of exploits like dupes before the game launches lmfao 
---
What?
---
Lucky.  
---
Not it's not.
---
Your character doesn‚Äôt know that other games exist. What is there that your character knows about that suggests anyone else is alive?
---
That was all in jest.
---
 I do get frustrated that they think this game was acceptable to make any dime off of. It still is not in a state where they should receive any revenue off of it in my opinion.
---
YES. Finally, someone who actually knows what a full team can do in N weeks. Because I sure don't, but it doesn't make sense that a full studio could take 3 months and still not have a fix for energy weapons!
---
r/Fallout76FilthyCasuals is great if you're sick of the negativity of this sub.
---
I can‚Äôt operate my garage door to close when I want it closed. It auto opens when I approach camp. And it has power. Am I missing a switch or something ?
---
You evil GENIUS.
---
Ending? Do you mean completing the Overseer's series of missions, which can't be completed? 
---
Just in general what I‚Äôm saying is I think it would be better to have fallout content instead of negative feedback.
---
Now that I'm home, often times Newegg requires you to input a sitewide coupon code to get the advertised price. Just incase you looked and were wondering. 
---
*Toxic Gamer Culture*
---
Only games journalist can think of phrases that embarrassing lmao. 
---
Agreed.
---
That doesn't go anywhere
---
If you're saying "it sounds" that means you haven't even been playing it, meaning you're getting all of your information from some idiots bitching and moaning.  The game is not about grinding, the materials they're crying about can be found all over the place and with the right skills only takes 1-2 each of even the rarest material to repair a piece of armor to 200% durability.
---
The main story
---
Okay.  I understand that.  So make a new sub that is about fallout content, and don‚Äôt allow constant negativity towards the game.
---
&gt; You don‚Äôt seem to understand that I‚Äôm agreeing with you at all.
---
You aren't though, you just directly implied I'd be banned for playing the game as intended when someone reports me, I'm saying that is impossible.  We are in disagreement
---
Really? Even with iron clad. My armor seems weak. 
---
Plans are available now, so can go crazy along the if ya want.  ;)
---
So people duped weapons that can one shot any enemy... because their armor cost two ballistic fiber to repair?
---
While that certainly is a possibility, I really *really* don't think it is likely that a company with the resources and size of Bethesda is concerned with the happenings of subreddits that have already been pretty much entirely negative towards them and their products for the past five or so years. 
---
Changing the minds of people who are already actively against your product offers extremely small rates of conversion, then add into the consideration that despite being a very loud and passionate community, the subs are only a tiny percentage of the scope of their target audience... there really isn't much to be gained in arguing or trying to convince people who are upset with your company and your previous products. Despite what angry fans think they know, any knowledgable marketing strategist knows arguing and deception will get you nowhere with them. There is far more opportunity to be found in other areas so it makes sense to invest in alternative marketing strategies that offer a higher conversion rate- and again a company as big as Bethesda who has a massive marketing department absolutely would have knowledge of things like this.
---
Again, I am not saying there aren't PR companies using fake accounts on various platforms using guerilla marketing tactics, but the payoff and minimal potential of stirring a shitpot when you already have massive marketing campaigns, TV commercials, and (albeit super cringey) collaborations with streamers, rick and morty, etc... changing the mind of an angry subreddit is small potatoes. Though that isn't to say there are die  hard fanboys making new accounts or using alts to do their own personal army shilling lol. 
---
All the same- I appreciate an actual response and discussion and not just being called a shill for disagreeing haha.
---
Reddit is not google therefore you are wrong. Clearly you are the lazy dipshit
---
I appreciate your in-depth analysis on melee being overpowered. I too have been shown a lesson in VATS melee tactics. 
---
Tbh try and sell it while you can, it's a load of shit. I've played every fallout game, and enjoyed them, but this fallout ruined any future buy from Bethesda and frankly early access money grabs from any game since it was so poorly worded, literally a scam. 
---
Reddit is a fickle thing. I think Bethesda's unstoppable onslaught of lackadaisical, extremely lethargic "updates" has finally turned the majority against them.
---
Ah, yes. You are correct, sir!
---
What system are you on?
---
Tons of people on this sub will try to claim the scorchbeasts are working as intended when half of them machine gun fire their sonic attack and it looks hilariously obviously broken
---
I agree that something like this *should* be a one line code change, and if it weren't it would be the result of a thought process that ought not have been in control of the code architecture. However, I personally have run into instances where this type of insanity has made a one line change into a near whole class refactor. Again, i'm making this point from anecdotal evidence so perhaps my lens through which i'm seeing the issue is skewed. I'm just making the claim that it might not be as safe of an assumption as we're making it out to be. 
---
Maybe I'm wrong, and maybe there's incompetent developers unable to make that one line change, but I'm inclined to give them a modicum of the benefit of the doubt here. 
---
Do you get tired of being at the bottom of every thread? How are you THIS ignorant. 
---
You use google to go on to Reddit so I‚Äôm still using google dipshit 
---
That is your opinion, and I can see that sentiment. But, It wasn't necessary at all, and the justification of it as a balance was poor.
---
Team?!  More like one poor bastard hopelessly attempting to put out brush fires in the inferno.
---
and one intern who 'posts' on public sites to make it look like Beth cares...
---
You are just bullshitting and it‚Äôs so it‚Äôs obvious. You‚Äôre not fooling anyone kiddo. Get the fuck outta here
---
I'm running a somehow balanced sneak/sniper/auto/melee-build (first and only char) and can kill almost anything with no great effort. I can even facetank a scorchbeast without PA using a maximum of 2 stimpacks.
---
Well if it will ruin your day maybe I will reinstall right now.
---
I suppose the shittiness of the game has given you a bad mood so you can only interact in a passive aggressive manner against other people? 
---
Just like in the game? 
---
There was more than one vault. Its not like Vault-Tec was hidden before the war. 
---
^hah!
---
nice one
---
It's the logical conclusion, right?
---
It takes me 6 ballistic and 6 screws to repair each piece of my armor with the WK perk. Maybe I am doing something wrong, but I dunno. Definitely doesn't take me 2 BF to repair anything that I am rocking.
---
Hmmm that is interesting.
---
So I stopped playing because it was so glitchy and unstable it was nearly unplayable. That's more my concern than the overall structure of the game. The overall structure of the game is Fallout without all the story stuff. Fine enough. 
---
But is it actually working now? 
---
I hope they go the NMS route but Hello Games had their entire reputation on that one game. Bethesda on the other hand can kind of go "oops we fucked that one up. we won't do multiplayer again (for a while) and get back to making the single player games you love" and still have a bunch solid brands that will sell regardless.
---
And what would you scrap it into?  Fractional amounts of materials?  It's the same reason they can't just add in the ability to sell ammo to vendors, they'd have to be worth fractional amounts of caps.  First they'd have to add in a system for bulking ammo at the tinker bench and they'd have to balance it against perks like Ammosmith.
---
It's even more baffling that you're still lurking around a subreddit for a game you think is garbage.
---
I typed the wrong thing first, I've since edited it. If it still doesn't work I don't know what to tell you, it goes there for me.
---
I couldn't speak on their engine, but most programming takes place nowadays in the form of Object-Oriented programming. This basically means you have classes, or 'objects' which represent actual things in the game world. So you might have a master class of Enemy, which will have some certain pre-defined things. E.g. :
---
An enemy class consists of :
---
Attack speed
---
Damage
---
Armor
---
Movement Speed
---
Attack Type
---
This means that every enemy will have all of these things, however you can make sub-classes of enemies which vary it up and add extra stuff. But kinda going into more detail than is necessary here. 
---
For Attack Type you might have a number of Attack classes to choose from, just as you would have a number of Enemy classes to choose from.
---
In this example, we'd say that the Enemy Scorchbeast would have its Attack Type for the attack they'd want to nerf. Depending on how Bethesda have their system set up, you could say that the attack speed is built into the Attack class itself, and that the Attack Speed in the Enemy class is just a multiplier, so a Scorchbeast Queen might use an attack faster than a normal Scorchbeast, as well as doing more damage etc. If you want to tone this down, all you have to do is change the multiplier of Scorchbeast Queen's attack, or change the attack speed in the Attack Type. You can go further with the fine-tuning of this, but as they're only changing it for a certain Enemy class, they can simply add in an IF statement, which says that IF the Enemy Scorchbeast uses this Attack Type, then disallow use for x seconds.
---
Sorry if this doesn't make great sense, got people shouting in my ear in the next room and I kept losing my train of thought! 
---
So? There were also people alive outside the vaults. But every single interaction with a human is ‚Äòoops they are actually dead‚Äô. Are all the best and brightest from 76 suddenly struck with irrational hope over evidence based decisions?
---
No I use the reddit app. And just because you use a car to go to the grocery store doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre buying the groceries from your car. See how stupid your logic sounds?
---
.
---
Well to me nuking the queen is the Biggest Thing you can do, but story wise the multipart Overseer's missions is the main story. And it's ridiculous that I still have all of those but they're marked incomplete. wtf.
---
I hope you can find some comfort in [Cyberppunk 2077](https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer/).
---
This industry is itching for a well-respected developer to push out a title free from EA/Activision/Greed influence. I think Cyberpunk has a good shot.
---
Nah, I'm on PC. Guess my adventure continues. 
---
It's hard to imagine a more useless human being. Yet here you are 
---
There was a big uproar of a lack of respec so they might add that later. Otherwise I'd grab the perks youd switch for first and the respec.
---
I don't know who downvoted you, but you're absolutely right.
---
Oh those are awesome fun.  If you have enforcer it's typically one shot per huge leg to disable.  At that point I like to nip off its arms to start the self destruct and just kite stuff around it to share the big boom.
---
This.
---
At least let me be able to have one perfect item per month, with a lot of work.
---
Do your stupid random system, but allow minimal control.
---
Well, I didnt buy a bag, I bought the game cause some friends were buying it (they all abandoned it too). 
---
What makes it more addicting than say just playing fallout 4? 
---
And the reason I stopped playing was it had so many bugs that I thought I had to call someome to fumigate. Like I couldn't play for 30 minutes without finding unkillable enemies that drained my health for being in their vicinity, or getting booted or any number of game breaking bugs. 
---
If its stable at least then I can see some appeal. But when I bought it the thing was unplayable. 
---
I've been thinking about writing my own personal balancing to the meta
---
No I don‚Äôt want it to die. Hell I still play it at least an hour a day but content is lacking and the patch‚Äôs they put out sometimes breaks the game even more. I have a lvl 141 and a lvl 80 who I grind shit for but I‚Äôm noticing that my attention is shifting to other games. 
---
The trick to sentry bots is to take cover until they overheat and go into their cooldown animation, during which you can shoot the exposed fusion cores on their back for massive damage.
---
No. They know there are humans and lets say there aren't. Lets say 76 was the last of them. They still have to kill the scorched so they aren't killed by them later. Its all about human survival
---
Finally some drama that is not directed at Bethesda...... Day of out Fallout.
---
Agreed, a pity that most if not all of the folks in that picture were possibly banned for possession of illicit dev room content.
---
Yeah it kinda got swarmed by the fallout sub.  The filthy casuals one is modded pretty close though.
---
The negativity is a reflection of the state of the game. And nothing is bringing the playerbase back except for fixes to things people actually want fixed, and even that is doubtful, as many who move on to other games rarely look back.
---
Nobody paid "$200 for a game" either. They paid $200 for a game, steelbook, collectable helmet, canvas bag, glow in the dark map, and figures.
---
I get value is subjective and maybe you weren't interested in all that but calling people idiots for buying it is just rude and uncalled for.
---
Do you not buy collectibles of some form or another? I think most of us have a collection of some form or another that someone else probably seems silly or a waste of money. Hell, a lot of people think that of gaming in general. 
---
It just works.
---
I mean when I got it I couldn't deny it had potential. Linking up with friends and running around always makes games better. Just I seemed to have an exceptionally bad time with all the glitches. Made the game virtually unplayable for me. 
---
To me the no NPC was the biggest mistake. Yeah in past games environmental storytelling was a nice feature, because it just a part of telling the story, along with NPC;s giving you quests. Having environmental storytelling be the ONLY way to tell the story is different.
---
He only knows him as Sal!!!!
---
How do they **know** there are humans?
---
And if there aren‚Äôt then why, specifically, Ian my character required? I‚Äôm not the ‚Äòsole survivor‚Äô I‚Äôm not the ‚Äòlone wanderer‚Äô. If I never created a character the story would progress the exact same way. There is no narrative hook.
---
I ended up putting 9 points into repair avoidance (3 White Knight, 3 Lucky Break, 3 Luck of the Draw). I go through maybe 2 ballistic fiber a day.
---
My difficulty is letting go of things. I'll log out until the next vendor reset because I don't want to throw away junk. A few days ago someone dropped about 500lbs of scrap in the artisan's corner, I picked it up, and I've hardly played since, just logging in to sell a bit each day.
---
My first character's a melee+pistol character ([perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f45549e&amp;d=s52si0sj0sg2ss2se2pa0p80p90p10ei0ep0ew0e10c72cu0i30ia0i50ad0ak0al0a00a80au2l71lu2lt2lp2l22e00i10ao0sf0&amp;w=&amp;n=Pistol%20Melee%20Mutant%20NonPA)), so everything that doesn't fly goes down really quick. I use a walking cane and that's good enough for everything.
---
I've started a second character where I've promised myself no melee perks, and to get chameleon ([tentative perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=9a3569e&amp;d=sg2p10ep0ew0e10c72cu0a00au2l71lu2lt2lp2l22i10ao0sd0sf0so0s01sp0pp2pg0ph0pi0ik0pd0pk0pl0a80as0ic3at1&amp;w=&amp;n=RifleShotgunMutantNonPA)). That'll mean weaker armor (whatever I can find in weightless) and I'll need to craft high volumes of ammo. I left no room for hacker/locksmith this time because I can't remember anywhere in the game where it was important. The stronger the lock, the weaker the loot.
---
Xbox, literally lost my eye of, voice of set and the Blade by just try taking them out of storage. The other two garments are the only things that didn‚Äôt seem effective.
---
I don‚Äôt know what to do now. Went down to the basement and had to log in and out just to get in. But could craft anything there.
---
Went back to where I found the eye on the corpse and it was not there.
---
How did I insult anyone? I called you all troopers. That's a compliment. 
---
You seem like you wanna be butthurt by the bad internet man before even reading the post. 
---
I am literally asking if it has gotten better. 
---
So maybe dont throw your frustration at random people on the internet and in fact fix whatever is so upsetting in your real life. 
---
Damn that‚Äôs cold
---
yeah, strange thing, there are a lot of players in the worlds but none seems to be interested in droping nukes anymore, think i serve hoped 20 times today, not one single nuke.. this was on xbox, but i have a pc char as well, same thing there, maybe a little bit better, but not much :/
---
And before someone says so, yes, i know i can drop them myself, is just a observersion :)
---
I'll just say this, before I accidentally deleted my fast travel mat (they were buildable in beta) it always worked for me just fine. So it should be as simple as it seems to be.
---
Well the head is where the brain is. The brain controls all of the bodies functions like breathing etc. 
---
That one‚Äôs easy... I won‚Äôt 
---
Just like the miscellaneous mission to search the East turn tunnel (or whatever it is) for survivors.... You know full well no fuckers alive and all you find is bodies with holotapes on. Have to say having no NPCs in this game is depressing as fuck, and those annoying robots that keep saying "how can I help mmmmmmmaaaaaaammmmmmm" are annoying af
---
That is so you can decide. You know there are humans because you said it yourself. You're not the sole survivor. You know others walked out and follow the same path. 
---
I mean I dontnintend any insult to the players. None at all. The game however, well that's another story. I did not feel that I was given an adequate product for my 60$.
---
I am literally just asking people who have managed to stick with it if it is better. 
---
People are so sensitive on reddit. Every post I make has a dozen people telling me I'm being mean. 
---
" If this sub could be exactly the same as the FO4  "   
---
Fallout 4 isn't a flaming trainwreck that somehow keeps getting worse with each update. It's not the subs fault Bethesda keeps screwing the game up worse with each patch. There was a time within the first few weeks when people got used to the game not being perfect, but still being playable with a potential for fun, where people actually did make posts like you wanted. But then the experience nerfs and Whitesprings nerf came, making the endgame grind even worse. With every good thing a patch does it introduces two things to make the game worse.
---
Friend and I do this at whitesprings. Not sure if it helps anyone else but it helps our game.
---
Lol. OP thinks posts only being positive would bring back the playerbase especially after the recent ITV disaster. 
---
If you follow the through line of the negative comments I think you'd see that players want content as well - in the game.
---
Wow, thanks for the very in depth explanation! It does make sense. I did take Java in high school (about 12 years ago now) and I remember we were told to leave notes with // I think to explain to other people how things work as well. 
---
So I suppose it would have to be super amateur code for things not to be easy to find and figure out for the team.
---
I guess it really just is as simple as changing a few values then huh (at least for these kind of enemy changes)?
---
Again, thanks for the explanation
---
I want to be able go find a scew mold and make screws out of steel
---
Ahh ...never saw that in patch notes as an intended change
---
I don't know exactly what you are talking about, but I have used suits of Power Armor as stepping stones to reach higher places when my Marsupial was bugged or absent.
---
Okay anyone other than angry fan bois upset that I dont like their favorite game capable of giving me a unbiased state of the game summary?
---
Has it in fact improved? Or are all the issues at launch still present? 
---
Cool wastland outfit skins, excavator paint, more gun and melee skins. 
---
Or, you could just make the attack speed  variable of scorchbeasts, not inherit from the other classes, and use it‚Äôs own value for attack speed, like anyone who has programmed in a object-oriented language for 5 minutes would do.
---
It‚Äôs not complicated even if you wanted it to be, in the worst scenario, to any decent programmer, it‚Äôs a 10 minute fix at the absolute most.
---
Yep, initial server found screen at 12am...was 30 minutes. I actually fell asleep and the next day when I logged in , I was starving and dehydrated with 1 hp. Everything was slow motion...loud heartbeat and dropped frames. So it must have eventually connected...just not in the 30+ minutes prior to passing out
---
FUN DETECTED
---
YES!!!   
---
I need to get my Snake Plissken on!
---
Well damn, you‚Äôre a lot smarter than literally dozens of people I‚Äôve encountered in this game lol.
---
But I can‚Äôt decide can I? The path is the same, and to what end? What makes my character different? What gives me a reason to go down the road most travelled? Nothing. Save an empty world so that you and everyone else who has saved it can fill it up again. Except I‚Äôm sure no one would notice if there was one less vault resident hanging around.
---
I'll bet it's a scenario where they have no documentation and the people who know where the bodies are buried have been reassigned.
---
It might be lagging. Check your inventory and storage again.
---
Why do we need to remove the .44 though?
---
The thing that was cool about the fallout series was the factions and how you could decide who to help. The game responded to your choices. Factions either liked you or didnt because of the things you did. Certain quests were only available if you chose to side with particular factions, others would be closed off. 
---
In FO76 your choices dont mean anything. You just have to unlock quests by doing thier prerequisites. Your actions dont impact the world in any way. 
---
It would.be cool if you could have certian conditions a server could be in. Where the players actions can change that condition from one state to another. You could automatically be placed on a server with the same conditions as the one you left. Other people in your game could change what condition your server would be in and you can either help them or go against them.
---
It could just be simple game states like a couple levels of rebuilding progress of a town or the agression level of rival factions. You could even have players work as raiders against people who want to build up farms and settlements. There could be resources under the control of different factions which would give a certain edge for your current team gameplay. 
---
Maybe you could integrate your own base building into the battle plans. You could have different blueprints stored for the different strategic locations important to the play between factions. That way you could integrate multiple peoples builds into one server without overlap issues. 
---
There are so many ways to build on the promise of taking Fallout online. I hope they dont kill it before we can see it become something cool. 
---
Trouble is, when they make those small changes quickly, we get fusion core processors running at 0.8 rather than 8.0. *Should* be plenty easy to implement a change like that in less than an hour all told... Alas
---
You can be a trader, farmer, mercenary, whatever you want. Hunt monsters, walk the roads in search of those to kill. Be bounty hunters, get bounties, do whatever you want. No two players experienced the same thing. Thats the whole point.
---
Just wanting to thank someone 
---
For first char I'd recommend maxing STR for melee (it's so disgustingly good you don't need the weapon specific perks).
---
Build a tiny base, I recommend a 1x1 Foundation (never put this in BP) that uses stairs to goto a 3x3 with you crafting benches and such.  The point here is to keep it simple so you can shift base when you need to scrap/craft/store and ulyour nowhere near a train station.
---
Don't repair until 40ish, just scrap and rebuild, it's typically cheaper.  Also, now that you can just buy armor plans it's even easier to craft what ya want (leather/trapper is quote fine).
---
If your facing stupidly high level stuff swap servers.  Enemy spawn is mostly based on who is I the cell when it populates.  
---
I did it‚Äôs gone.
---
Total conjecture, but I wouldn't be surprised if the number of people/man hour spent on Fallout 76 plummeted after it's essentially disastrous release.
---
Which is a shame. There's a great game here, it's just buried beneath a mountain of glitches and broken mechanics.
---
Yeah, it's far less glitchy than it was on release. There is still the server lag and disconnects for some, as well as the occasional bug. It's pretty much where it should have been for day 1. 
---
Have Atomic Shop lamps, attract radio active moths br√∂ther.
---
I'll have to get screenshots, but ‚Ä¶ the monorail line around downtown Morgantown has several bridges that lead into the city, one of which leada to "History of Morgantown" holotapes. (Part I or II. Teh other's in teh port-a-potties on the ground in the 'war camp' on the ground. Part III is in the tower/fort on the monorail path, while Part IV is tucked away in the narrator's own little rooftop alcove away from the fighting camps. 
---
She talks about her neighbor "On the next roof" but that section has several buildings that are like an island without the usual Morgantown ramps/pathways leading up to it. There's a building on the left that you can jump to, but the jump from it to a neighbor is just a smidge too high to make without Marsupial. On the right is a TALL building that could be reached with a jump, but the angle's too steep to walk over. Those are the only two paths that MIGHT lead to the island building, but danged if I can make it. Mind you, I managed the acrobat challenge obstacle course, so I'm decent enough at jumping for this game, but there's just some path I'm not seeing. 
---
I'll try and get screenshots next time I'm there.
---
Right, this sub is for whining only.
---
My camp is on a edge of a cliff between savage divide and the mire, and whenever i spawn at my camp or respawn there, it spawns me 25m below my camp. And this sucks if you're farming a nuke zone
---
Under Armor that gives 500 Rad Resist - now that would be a great compromise!
---
People aren't leaving the game, just this sub. 
---
Question. Did you walk up to their house to punch it?
---
If I recall correctly, you can changed that studded to buttressed and increase that reduction even more.
---
Just be in pacifist mode, then things like this do not happen 
---
Arnt they suppose to plan content ahead of release? Anthem already has a roadmap of the coming months with March having major content already being added. You know most online games these days.
---
Everyone has an individual loot table, exception are rare items in nukes. Hardened mass, glowing fluids and the like is first come first server.
---
Exactly. 100 ways to cut it any none of them can ever justify anything close to the time it's taken them.
---
But they did experience the same thing. Leave the vault. Follow the overseer. Do the same things for the same dead people to protect some more dead people from dead and reanimated people. And everything you do is something that every other living soul is going to do. So why bother?
---
https://m.imgur.com/5uRyniO
---
I feel your pain
---
Exactly.  We needed more NPCs.  The grafton quests, Watoga mayor, the enclave, rose the raider. At least those give you some feedback which makes sense.  The scorch detector quest is really empty. 
---
Hell, they could have added human NPCs with floating gamer tags who just don‚Äôt respond and I wouldn‚Äôt know it. At least the game would have more PEOPLE playing at a time. 
---
Happened to me at about 5 before 2, I wasn't going to wait for it to load, not dealing with it.
---
I went into some kind of bubker, and it looked like there was some sort of cryogenic chamber in there. I also found some alien blaster rounds.
---
Possibly having to do with zetas??
---
This suggestion hits too close to home
---
Well shit. If you're on PC I'll give you mine if you want. 
---
You‚Äôre right actually, I‚Äôve seen a large influx of new players coming out of the vault. Because I have so much excess shit, I‚Äôve been setting up my camp in front of the overseer‚Äôs camp and crafting the newbies full leather armour with a hardened pipe pistol and a couple hundred .38‚Äôs.
---
Nope, I was gonna trading with some randoms, when I accidentally hit R2 right as the trade ended
---
If you are just looking for an unarmed weapon, you can find a power fist in a house on top of tangra town. Otherwise you can find them for events, or as rare legendary drops.
---
Are you sure they experienced the same thing? Think about it. The story isn't the only thing that gives them experiences. Players team up and have fun with each other. Players are the NPCs. Players ask others to help out. They go on adventures and quest together. My stories of 76 are different than yours. Different experiences.
---
Lol, I can server hop and repurchase the base a LOT cheaper than blowing through stimpacks and ammo trying to defeat someone WAY outside my league. I like to win... but I know when to choose not to play lol
---
Does that mean someone sold it to the bot or is there a chance that the vendors will have a TSE as part of it‚Äôs inventory for sell?
---
You might add your platform so people will know
---
I crafted a max level power fist and it‚Äôs sad how much better it is at killing mobs than most of my legendary rifles , can‚Äôt mod it yet tho no plans 
---
honestly tho we should be able to attach mr. handy buzz saws to our power armor arm pieces and have it replace our unarmed attack with a buzzsaw. 
---
Anyone who inflicts damage gets to loot the dead thing
---
I don‚Äôt want to be in pacifist mode though, as I enjoy PvP, however, in times where I‚Äôm just trying to trade this is pretty annoying 
---
I believe it was sold by someone. 
---
Nice job on that one. I have to admit that.
---
Rad resist isn't enough, many people have tested the theory, both PA and the Hazmat suit have an effect that offsets the radiation damage significantly    
---
Bethesda Austin is the group in charge of fallout 76, I don‚Äôt think the people there had any idea what was going on.
---
Do you have a power switch attached to it?  There is a Building Plan called "Advanced Power Connectors", and it includes switches.  You build the garage door and a power source, as you have, but then you connect the power source to the switch, and then connect the switch to the door. Turning the switch off closes the door. Basically, if the door has power, it's open. It's, honestly, a little confusing.  They should have just included a power switch on the damn garage door...
---
Game has significant issues when too much is in the area, whitesprings tends to have a bunch of bots and ghouls.  It it bugs and spawns a bot army it will simply crash when ps4 tries to render the horde.
---
Also meat from the butchers bounty perk 
---
No problem. It can be very difficult to interpret someones code if they write it poorly, but the only way I can see them struggling that much with something like that is if the variables all have weird names and no // notation. I've done projects with people before who just call things something like class obj\_13 because they don't expect anyone else to have to work on it. Then he drops out of the course and me and my partners are left to figure out what does what in his jigsaw puzzle code.  To be fair to Bethesda, by the way they speak about the engine and finding stuff leftover from Morrowind in current code, I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case of what's gone on over there, and feel like that'd be more of a management issue if that's still ongoing.
---
But we are talking specifically about the story. If we have ended up at 'Ignoring the story builds the experiences' then I'd say that settles it.
---
Lol
---
I have 2 Xboxes, and when I load a character on one while standing in the area with a character on the other, I always see the camp spawn well ahead of the character.
---
When I FT to my CAMP or spawn in after quitting in my camp, the game is very inconsistent on where it places me, sometimes well away from my camp &amp; other times in one of my foundations, or in the middle of the nearby river.
---
I've tried moving the CAMP beacon to no avail, if it was just consistent based on Beacon location I could adjust for it.
---
I once got attacked by a rat near a players house and my mutation released a schockwave which has damged his house and i became wanted.
---
Already said Xbox 
---
I did a server hop on PC earlier this morning &amp; when i opened up the map I found only 1 other player.  Waited a bit figuring that things must be loading in slow...nope, no change.  Undoubtedly everyone was crouching &amp; in stealth the whole time, /s
---
It's really baffling.  If Bethesda cared at all, you'd think they would be racing to drop ***something*** to keep customers engaged.  With their fairly slow &amp; poor QC patches a person can't come to any other conclusion but that they already don't care.
---
Of course the people still playing and butthurt are too stupid to think.
---
It's called a front page boy.
---
It helps everyone, the problem is they've now made it nearly impossible to "loot everything" in a nuke zone.  
---
Dev's need to add a better "cleanup" process for meat piles, they persist forever 
---
There should also me a period of 5 seconds where after you kill someone who is wanted at their base, you can't become wanted if a stray shot hits a wall of their camp. I can't tell you how many times this has happened to me lol
---
The guy asked you a legitimate question. Get your head out of your ass and stop acting like such a butthurt millennial about it. Your original post had zero context (and was written like it came from a 4th grade emo kid‚Äôs journal) so stop acting put out when people want more information.
---
I‚Äôm honestly surprised they care about your little ‚Äúlook at me‚Äù post anyway
---
Want a post to get butthurt about? This is the one. I‚Äôm genuinely insulting you... because I find you to be genuinely insulting...
---
That guy, however, did not.
---
The Division 1 had a game breaking bug for over a month because it required a major patch to fix and Sony/MS required $$$ to do that. No hotfixes on consile is definitely a real thing. 
---
RDR2 hasnt had an update since RD:O came out AFAIK and its full of bugs and glitches. 
---
BFV doesnt get hotfixes on console either; neither does CoD. 
---
Even the F2P games on console dont get weekly, or even monthly, updates. Warframe, DD2, FN, etc...
---
The only game I play where I see regular patches, updates, and hotfixes is World of Warcraft...on PC. So as a console player, Bethesda isnt any different in how they implement changes, at least as far as regularity, than any other game Ive ever owned.
---
That other user is a bit abrasive, but he isnt entirely wrong. Its not that Bethesda is exempt, its just that theyre in line with other companies and how they do things when there is a console version of the game. People are going around in RDR subs complaining about content updates and bugs right. Ow as well (3 months since the last one someone was saying). BFV has about one a month. Acting like theyre worse than everyone else simply isnt true. 
---
When Bioware is better at this than Bethesda ugh.
---
In the known issues and feedback list t clearly says that they plan to address this issue in the next patch, making so that you only get wanted if you break a structure.
---
No you said that everyone experiences the same thing. That was to prove it doesn't. Players might hire other players to help with the story. I had someone help a nuke run. The core of the story is the same, but thats the same thing as every other game. The players are what makes it different. When I did the BoS part, there was another player there. We went through the place together. A BoS soldier helped me join their ranks.
---
Got a 2* anti-armor off a legendary protectron in Watoga. 
---
Will do next time or now if I can. New to this lol. It‚Äôs ps4 tho 
---
That sucks :/
---
I ahve it for 1000 caps
---
I would love this. Chinese assault rifle skin/variant for the handmade. Deliverer variant for the pistol. Stuff like that. 
---
I‚Äôd also like to see some throwback outfits in the atom shop. Pint sized slasher mask. Mechanist armor. Riot gear.
---
People will buy shit like that. They love customization. How Bethesda is so blind to this is beyond me. The amount of junk in the atom shop is embarrassing 
---
Did you find the place? If not I will have to go into the game again and figure out exactly where it was again and give you the location name.
---
You can get a commie whacker sand paddle ball at Camden park for Mr.Fuzzy tokens. You can also find the chainsaw at a bed and breakfast somewhere in the savage divide.
---
Shouldn't leave your lamps on.
---
People say they're still coming but also there were datamined holiday messages that imply we were to get something "on them" but those were pulled
---
My biggest issue is that out of the two or three dozen times I've triggered the spawn, he *never has that damn longcoat!*
---
Take your up-vote, and my reddit bronze, ya filthy animal.
---
The voice acting and writing really is quite good, which is why the rest is such a damn shame
---
https://assets.rbl.ms/18193124/210x.gif
---
That sucks. 
---
I like McClintock for this. Plenty of ammo pouches, military-grade duct tape, and clipboards for those sweet, sweet springs. Ironically, doing this actually got me all the springs I needed to complete my X-01 armor, so now I hardly ever wear regular armor anymore and don't need the ballistic fiber.
---
First it‚Äôs not going free today and second all the stuff can be earned free in game. I‚Äôve got all my stuff for free off the atom store. I‚Äôm sorry you dislike it and it has it problems but Bethesda has already stated it‚Äôs not going free to play and their atom store isn‚Äôt that bad. Right now it‚Äôs priced similar to other early release titles. Let‚Äôs hope they keep developing the game but looking at the sales numbers where it‚Äôs at least sold two and a half million copies it‚Äôs safe to assume that they are dedicating some resources to it also considering they don‚Äôt have much else to work on at the moment then I‚Äôd expect that they will for at least 6 months to try to get the game in a better state. It‚Äôs a good idea that way released way to early. I hope they can fix it because it has a lot of promise if they do. ESO racks in cash for them so it‚Äôs not unrealistic to think that this game can as well if property supported. 
---
I picked up the coat today, but I don‚Äôt really need it. Have literally just posted to sell on the Market sub.
---
You don't know what passive aggressive is. There was nothing passive about my comment. You won't enjoy this game. It wasn't designed for you, and you are not welcome in it.
---
This is literally a discussion thread about the story of Fallout 76.
---
&gt;The core of the story is the same, but thats the same thing as every other game.
---
No it really isn't. The core of this game's story is you are literally the same as every other living person and will do the same activities as them in order to achieve the same goal of maybe saving the lives of people that may already be dead.
---
Other games give choices. Other games have residents that are clearly not capable of doing what you are going to do. Other games have a reason that the player character **has** to exist. Fallout 67 does not.
---
I don't know how your front page works but I only get the default subreddits and the ones I'm subscribed to, so again if you're still subscribed to a game you seem to loathe so much maybe you're the one with a problem here.
---
Shit, people were warning about this back in Dec or Jan. I read about this issue over a month ago.
---
PC?
---
What's the point of the Chameleon mutation? It seems totally useless to me compared to just having a piece of chameleon armor. I have the mutation. I don't get the point of it.
---
Do you need more than one ballistic fiber to repair armor now? 
---
A true Brit wouldn‚Äôt stare, that‚Äôs rude. A true Brit would ‚Äòtut‚Äô and possibly exhale slightly more loudly than usual. That‚Äôs the British way. I should know, I am one. 
---
I haven't seen either of these quests in a *very* long time as well.
---
Yep. Ign m3diocr3 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt put much stock into people saying they‚Äôre coming, seems like they were implemented specifically for events and even the consumable lunch boxes that were found in the dev room from when that cheat/bug was a thing, probably only exist for the developers to test the event‚Äôs effects before they go live. I would say anything promoting the rumor of loot boxes doesn‚Äôt have any viable proof of it. 
---
Same happens to us on ps4. But it is a rare thing. 
---
That‚Äôs good to hear
---
Yeah, people got tired of farming ultracite explosive vents, I mean farming the SBQ. The sad part is that it took Bethesda 3 months and a lot of people's patience to realize the Queen's loot is total garbage compared to the stimpacks and ammo needed to beat her down and also to run the nuclear silo :/
---
I figured out what this is, I think. When you run up to a lock and quickly hit Unlock, the character's body is still adjusting a little bit from the motion. So I guess you have to wait a sec or two. This was not the case on the xbox version of Fallout 4.
---
I will say, I actually like the Freddy quest simply because it is the only one (correct me if I'm wrong) that the person might actually be alive. Every other one the people are definitely dead.
---
I complained about this the other day having played a lot and seen a downward trend in player counts in servers on ps4.
---
Today was different.
---
4 nukes in 4 different servers and 6 TS and 3 bloodied weapon drops later, I was pretty happy.
---
gonna join you in a bit, how long will you be on?
---
I like it, it leaves a lot of room for imagination to fill in the bits. Or did fallout players lose their imagination? 
---
No just in workshops 
---
Lets say the player in 76 didn't exist, someone else does the job. In Call Of Duty, if your character didn't exist, the military gets another recruit to take your place. In Forza Horizon, another racer takes your place. 
---
Final Fantasy is a great game series. However, your character isnt yours to make and follows a path. This game lets you make your character and follows a main quest path that can change difficulty, enemies and/or how the place looks. This game is built around seeing other players. The story reflects that 
---
I would be pissed if my full auto heavy weapons have even less condition than they do now. A gatling plasma survives about 2 cores from 200% condition. The gatling laser is about 1 full clip. The minigun is not even worth using at all since it eats ammo, breaks quickly and does almost no damage due to firing lots of small damage and how that works with the armor mechanic. 
---
The heavy guns need their durability massively increased. What they should do is balance the guns around how often you should have to repair it per damage done. So that all guns do XXX damage/repair approximately.
---
I guess the Game have bigger problems then the useless and fucked up Housing nonsense. Please, stop posting requests for trivial roleplay stuff like this when the whole Game is broke as hell, is this really your only problem in the game that bugs you? 
---
It's easy to miss, before "Black Tuesday" (trademark pending /s) the sub was flooded with new posts...   
---
And reactive plates are awesome PvE
---
No one said a "loot system like Diablo".  The suggestion was to use something like Diablo 2's gem system, which used rare materials to create a specific legendary weapon that could not be acquired from random drops. Then I suggested that they could *learn a lot* from Diablo 3's Loot 2.0 system, which, love the game or hate it, addressed and fixed most of the problems with the original D3 loot system. D3's original loot system feels *very* much like what we have right now in FO76; completely, *unapologetically*, random. Which, as many players seem to be expressing, is not very fun.
---
loot boxes turned out to be bullshit, free to play turned out to be bullshit, people who want the game to fail are back to complaining about no npcs and inside the vault not having much information.
---
That's what the Vault 76 propaganda wants you to think, but it also assumed that you'd emerge into a living world you'd help rebuild, the world that the Responders and others inhabited.
---
It didn't assume that there would be a plague that wiped them all out before you arrived.
---
I rarely get disconnected these days but I previously had the game crash at least once an hour. I still rarely take workshops if alone due to the fear of time and caps wasted.
---
Got some today from taking over a camp. If I haven't dropped them, you can have them if on ps4. 
---
That what we're calling the recent patch? I haven't actually played since I got RE2 (got collector's editions of both games and I hate having to swap discs because the XB1's disc drive SUCKS).
---
Because this is Fallout 4 but rushed to make it online, this game needed way more time or to be labeled what it is, early access.
---
The nerfs are one thing, but we‚Äôve ran out of content to do since the first month. When are we getting something else to do? Scorchbeast Queen is fucked and there‚Äôs no other end game content. So why play?
---
Unfortunately, I'm on PC...and stuck at work until at least 9 tonight.
---
Omg.. lmao!!!
---
I want to keep one of those robot figurines (example: protectron) without them being put in a paper bag or being scrapped by accident.
---
What about it are you struggling with? 
---
Great read. Perfect 5/7 Fallout story.
---
I like the idea that legendary enemies drop a one-star, two-star, or three-star "legendary mod." This should be easier for the loottables as it doesn't have to calculate "hmm lets give a wood left leg" as you will always get a "legendary mod" that matches the enemy stars, and is attachable at the respective crafting bench.   
---
That mod could then be applied to any weapon/armor you have (which encourages you to be able to craft your base item - even late game) and then it unlocks a random legendary effect.  
---
Once a legendary mod is on a weapon it cannot be removed (but maybe overridden by higher-star level mods). So there is risk in putting a mod on your decked out handmade, since if you apply a one-star mod you will have find/craft a new handmade to try another mod. (unless we allow higher stars to overwrite lower stars, that way if you want a 3 star handmade, you could apply a 3star to your AA handmade, but it will reroll the primary legendary effect)  
---
This also means the level of the legendary doesn't matter, so a level 50 player can give a level 10 a 1star legendary mod.  
---
Happen the other day
---
The late shift... laaame. Good luck my dude, hope it goes quick for you!
---
Take over a power plant .
---
Coming to an Atom shop near you! 
---
Sorry, I didn't read the other comments. 
---
The worst is when you get stuck in a foundation after fast traveling to your camp.  
---
Guest of honor! 
---
You are wrong. Everyone is dead because this is fallout76, and there are no living human NPCs. Shame on you
---
Mabey im crazy but I think having one weapon be the best for everything is not as fun as having different answers for different questions. Having a zealots be better at killing the queen than a tse makes sense. People should have to chose between 1 good all around gun like a tse or specific guns for specific battles which would need more maintaince and carry weight but be ultimately more powerful.   
---
This. I loved using a mod in fo4 that allowed me to unequip a legendary prefix/mod and transfer it to a different weapon. This randomized drop system results in me carrying around a ton of "ok" gear.
---
The firebreather perk reduces the screech attack damage and makes them much easier to deal with.
---
I know he's not in the game rn, but it is likely he made it to a vault, in which cause he may be an NPC introduced when a vault opens up.
---
Meh. I can't complain too much. OT is good money &amp; I've got the day off tomorrow.
---
They will probably come back in the atomshop i guess. 
---
Target the fusion core. Easy one shot kill. 
---
Once these changes were announced I put the game down and never picked it back up.  
---
That's what I call it...   
---
-Player count crashed (many people deny it but everyone's friends list is gutted)
---
-Nukes are very infrequent compared to before. 
---
-Reddit '76 Sub count crashed.
---
-countless "I'm quitting" after that and the Thursday Hotfix".  
---
-etc..  
---
Figured describing that day along the lines of a old school stock market crash would be fitting.
---
\* Fireproof
---
I had similar, but went off and rinsed thru the asylum and wavy willards came back with more junk than needed, checked the requirements and had plenty excess junk and it let me build so think the requirements list is in error, so even thou you meet the list requirements you are actually short so you can't build it 
---
Which terminal
---
I dont do it unless in a team that it can transfer to a friend. 
---
Very true, couldn‚Äôt agree more
---
Fixed, thanks!
---
It has something to do with how the servers are run. There can't be any change enacted upon the environment in any way. The one thing that seems to give it away for me is the date always resets, it's as if we are living in purgatory. The best way to fix this game is to somehow tie an objective in that requires somebody to take action 300 or so years in the future and have it take place as a single player DLC in the maps future, after that the skys the limit.
---
Yeah, just click the buttons. You don't have to do any of the obstacles. Just click the buttons in order.
---
&gt;In Call Of Duty, if your character didn't exist, the military gets another recruit to take your place.
---
Not really, because you are playing as a specific story-written character. You think in the Witcher if you didn't play they would just find a replacement for Geralt? Games with stories are very clear about why is has to be you. You are a decorated commander, you know the guy being chased, you have a team with a set of skills.
---
&gt;In Forza Horizon, another racer takes your place.
---
Racing games are not RPGs. You play Forza to drive, not to be told a story. Hey, in Fifa they would just get another team controller.
---
&gt;Final Fantasy is a great game series. However, your character isnt yours to make and follows a path.
---
Exactly. You are being told a narrative through defined and planned characters. If Squall didn't exist, if Zidane wasn't there, if Cloud poofed into thin air. What then? The story as written wouldn't just carry on. SeeD wouldn't be victorious, Kuja would take over the world, the planet would be destroyed by the Mako reactors. You follow a path because the story demands it of those characters *and only those characters*.
---
&gt;This game lets you make your character and follows a main quest path that can change difficulty, enemies and/or how the place looks.
---
No, it really doesn't. Nothing in the game is based on where you are on the main quest.
---
&gt; This game is built around seeing other players. The story reflects that
---
The story reflects that by being so awful that the only way to generate meaningful experiences is to throw it away and do your own sandbox thing.
---
Oh yeah forgot about that, I was surprised the first time my extra meat disappeared while with a team.
---
Hi all,
---
Is anyone getting an issue where the main menu doesn't appear? I cant get past the slideshow of music and vista, the main menu never appears.
---
This does not happen all the time.
---
Have you applied any mods to it? Can you share a screen shot of the weapon?
---
"Wow a guy never took the time to unsubscribe from this shitfest, he must really have a problem"
---
Nice try. Idiots and douches still play this game and you are both.
---
Camp size is by far the wankiest feature in the game. It has changed for me sooooo much out of nowhere that I've concluded it isn't a set value but rather tied to the server stability at the moment. Here are some tips I've found. Remove all turrets and stash boxes, sell or get rid lot of junk so that you have the lowest possible stash weight and carry weight, then server hop till no other person is even close to your camp, there isn't a nuke in the map and hopefully not many people on the server, also, if you can, try not to build too close to vendors. I built my camp and was full, and just by server hoping and getting low weight (doing the steps above) the camp size just magically increased by up to 12% which is just stupid in my opinion. Nevertheless I hope this helps :)
---
Hey bro, I never did the water chip in fo1, I delayed or opened up trade then tried to become a super mutant.
---
Fallout 2, I never became a pornstar, I never seduced a dog(wtf?) and I ended up pretty much joining the enclave. 
---
Fallout 3, I killed and ate pops and autumn at the same time thru the exploit, killed off the entire brotherhood, and dumped a fat load of rev into the purifier...

Fonv: I go straight fucking north, thru the cazadores, thru the bandits, thru the deathclaws and geckos, straight to fucking Benny up in his casino. Then I snack on the king and the old man, then I join the ncr and snack on the Caesar and the president. Delish. If I could kill yes man too I would...
---
Assuming we're talking about a CAMP, where is your CAMP?  These days, I think there are only a few places where multiple Scorchbeasts can show up.  Much of the center area of Cranberry Bog, the southeast corner of the Bog, and the extreme south of the Savage Divide.
---
Sometimes I'd get a triple Scorchbeast spawn in the middle of the Ash Heap between Welch and Lewisburg, but I haven't seen it in a long time.
---
This made me laugh. 
---
No not a camp. Just trying to quest and explore.
---
I was thinking of something along those lines also. WoW had Caverns of Time.
---
[https://wow.gamepedia.com/Caverns\_of\_Time](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Caverns_of_Time)
---
I was thinking how cool it would be to be a Raider in the party with the real Rose, to experience the story first hand. There could be some kind of DLC time travel to experience the events of the story.
---
OK but yesterday I was fighting one and my fusion core died on me. All I could do was walk towards her slowly as I was pelted with rockets and miniguns 
---
If the boxes were loot boxes won from events they'd be rad but the effects of peoples hate would still be present cause they will still shout its pay to win 
---
I don't use white knight or power armor and have literally never had a problem with repairs.  Maybe the people up in arms about this make zero attempts to avoid being hit and/or never bother to loot anywhere besides the Whitesprings golf course.
---
I think we'd all agree that certain aspects of durability and damage levels could use another look, but there is absolutely no arguing that the nerfed perks weren't unbalanced relative to their peers.
---
I got you. It is the other response..... just made me laugh
---
Unless you have IRL friends that own it or $60 to burn, I wouldn't. You can get a good 20-30 hours out of it in solo play but the game is, as my friend last night described it aptly, a "Freeroam" version of FO4. You can get a lot, if not more, satisfaction by just modding your FO4.
---
Plus, ethically, these bastards don't deserve your money.
---
I totally understand why people don't like it. It's super glitchy and there are tons of bugs and a few players that just attack on site but the whole time playing fallout 3 and 4 the main complaint I had was that it wasn't multi player. Me and my dad both played it and wanted a shared experience. 76 has given us that and I think that makes up for all the issues at least for me and my dad. We also got my sister into it and she's never played any fallout games before. I think it's a different take on fallout and I really dig it. I would recommend giving it another go. The worst thing that's gonna happen is that it's still not good and you don't play it but I think it's really taking steps in the right direction.
---
The number of times I've quested in an area that can have events, I'm like "Please don't start an Event, please don't start an Event, God damn it, I don't have time to do an event".  
---
That I hate even more, especially when the events are random things that really don't mesh well with either the quest or the game in general. Most events are a resource sink.
---
Yes, I've server hopped a few times to avoid events so I can get on with questing.
---
I hate players that don't clean up afer themselves. Always loot everything 
---
Thanks for the info. 
---
"I don't have a problem" says the guy raging over the fact people still enjoy a game he stopped playing yet refuses to let go of.
---
You need some more 'intellect' points irl apparently.
---
god no. we dont need more shit from the atom shop we need a BALANCED GAME with ACTUAL CONTENT
---
Below 50% at metacritic. Not because of a bag.
---
I seen one for sale in Whitesprings resort. The costume guy had it.
---
If this doesn't happen I'm uninstalling this garbage. I was hopeful but I am not anymore since main Bethesda studio isn't even helping to add this 
---
I definitely believe they planned to have them but then didn't. Probably way back before the battlefront shit, though. 
---
People were leaving in droves at ESO's launch, Bethesda didn't can that project. They realize how much they make with online games so they would rather fix it than scrap it. There will be an update in March, would suggest you check it out then
---
This sounds awesome
---
This game doesn't cost $60 anymore
---
They cant even fix simple bugs they aren't going to do your little pet projects. Stop. Its over. Use your head for one second. 
---
Two main chars. Both melee because I hate bullet sponge and I hate crafting ammo. 
---
Man, I'm so glad I rushed through the last couple achievements the week before RE2 came out. No real reason to boot it back up short of them making the game good or them doing an update that adds more achievements.
---
The locations with enemies change based on players. Surely you've seen that. And just saying, in the military, you start as a recruit. Even commanders start there. If a certain person didn't join, someone else can easily take their place. Forza Horizon was an example. There is a small story of a racing contest. Thats all. Final Fantasy was to show a lack of choices that changed the quest. Even Skyrim has a lack of choices for the main quest. Just because 76 doesn't have all the choices someone wants, doesn't mean the story is bad.
---
You obviously haven't looked through my post history, I absolutely did not vote for Don Cheeto. But thanks for playing. Keep stalking the poor workers at a satellite branch of a company that probably had zero say in the launch of this video game.
---
I would be happy to sell you Fallout 76. You should definitely buy my copy. 
---
Trying to find enough screws to fabricate Power Armor is taking all week. This is totally ludicrous.
---
Lol. This is being passive aggressive. You. Right now.  Unless you think this is aggression. In which case lol.  
---
But tell you what shitmatters. Ima reinstall just for you.
---
No don‚Äôt do it. I have played every fallout since the first and I‚Äôve loved everyone of them. New vegas is my fav, but this one is just horrible. I‚Äôve always wanted a fallout only or cool with friends and oh boy did I get one. This game offers a terrible story that is so dumb. 90% if the quests are fetch quests and the game play turns to bullet sponge  enemies after level 50 if u don‚Äôt have any super rare legendary items. Also there is no dlc in the near future so yeah they basically given up. And do t even get me started on the bugs. There have been so so so many. Much more than fallout 4. Even playing with best friends is only fun for a few days. The end game is boring and u just put a thousand rounds into an enemy dragon and spam stimpacks till u kill it. I got Maybe 10 or 15 hours of enjoyment out of this game so no it‚Äôs not worth it. Hope u safe your money for something else.  
---
Most of the things I've bought has been for my CAMP.  Things like the laminate floor, ceiling fans, succulents, Christmas lights, etc.  My character also has the Gridiron make-up.  I don't have much of an interest in paints since I don't use Power Armor.
---
I'd buy more outfits if they didn't consistently have some kind of visual "gotcha" I don't like.  The VTU Track Suit has that big ugly logo on the back, for example.
---
I have a build dedicated to this. I'll make a character with it when automatic weapons are buffed.
---
I love making builds and this was my favorite to make 
---
They are NOT Atomic Shop items for a simple reason, their files are not in Atomic Shop folder.
---
Plus the ones found in a dev room didn't have atom sign next to them.
---
I feel like a lot of people lost all hope in this game after the latest "Inside the Vault". A month or two ago I'm pretty sure this post would never get this many upvotes.
---
Well ... that definitely changes things. 
---
Well that‚Äôs encouraging, do you know if all of the masks were recovered from the dev room or just the owl mask?
---
Thanks I will try there.
---
You're right it's just like Todd said the other players are NPCs now applaud 
---
I feel you. Of all the things people are frustrated with it‚Äôs that damn agility course that has caused the most swearing from me. I finally got through it after taking chems to boost agility and a bobblehead too...I think. It was a while ago. Also someone told me to try it in the 3rd person view, not first and that made a difference because I could see my feet. I gave up on it for a long time I was so frustrated. So you‚Äôre not alone in your frustration. I don‚Äôt know if any of this helps, but good luck! 
---
it's not a shotgun, more like a noob tube attachment, it's a grenade launcher...  and their melee attacks are weak compared to their ranged, just get up close and melee it to death...
---
I dont dislike the base game. Or the concept or the art direction or pretty much anything but the story and the technical issues with the game. 
---
When I bought it, right after launch, it was really bad in terms of stability. Even for a Bethesda game. I like the idea of a group making their way through the wastes and such, just it's hard to enjoy when you get kicked out the game every 20 minutes. 
---
Knock, Knock.....
---
I don't know how much it changes things, but it definitely let's you skip part of it. You probably already understood that though. Good luck OP.
---
You take a workshop.
---
You build up the workshop.
---
You log out. Items you built for that workshop are stored in that workshop's "Stored" tab.
---
You log back in. You retake the workshop. The stuff you built previously is still there.
---
So far, so good.
---
Now someone takes the workshop from you and scraps the stuff you built. What happens?
---
A) Your build state is saved as soon as you lose control of the workshop. As soon as you reclaim the workshop, you can rebuild everything from the "Stored" tab. This means two things: one, **scrapping objects built by other players must not grant junk to the workshop or else you create a new dupe exploit**, and two, **workshop junk inventories must be tracked by PLAYER and not by WORKSHOP**, meaning for instance "my" Hemlock Holes has a junk inventory that's unique to me and different from "your" Hemlock Holes, and three, **objects built by other players are not added to your build state when you log out or lose control of a workshop.**
---
B) You lose your workshop progress. Sucks to be you.
---
I think A) would be possible but difficult to implement. It would inarguably make the game more fun and challenging, but I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
Woooow
---
Don't know for sure about anything from the dev room. But i doubt it, since everyone who got in it were banned, they could have passed items on different account tho
---
This is great!
---
The keyword here is "believe".
---
The people up in arms about this likely don't even give a shit about the repairs.  First this was the same patch that nerfed TSE weapons and since the majority of the community agreed that TSE weapons were too OP they needed something else to complain about the patch being unfair. Second there's just the people that like to stir up shit about the game feeding on people that don't know any better.  Even in t his thread there's a few people replying who admit to never having played the game but nonetheless agreeing with the OP about how grindy the game sounds.
---
That's cool, I don't use heavy guns in 76 because of the ammo situation, so I am not used to the condition.   But, I think we could agree they should do more damage.   I am a big fan of the laser gatling in FO4 with charging barrels. 
---
Happy to help, guess it's serving a second purpose!
---
the lunchboxes still haven't released, it is entirely likely they were meant as microtransactions (maybe still are, again, still not released), and the issue people had was some of the loot gives you a certain gameplay advantage, and if you had to buy the lunchboxes that would be pay to win, nothing about this story is bullshit... 
---
I've got quite a few more to add when I have time 
---
Def worth it
---
Yeah Gatling laser looks neat but anything over 30 they do nothing.
---
NPCs where? 
---
I usually put them in the random suitcases at whatever train station I'm headed to for selling.
---
Usually for me it's Whitesprings in the suitcase pile next to the stashbox. 
---
What's funny is that I thought that might be the case, but when I Googled it everyone was saying you had to complete the course for real.
---
Ah fuck, bed bugs again.
---
The game literally does have NPCs.
---
Thanks for the quantum, had not gotten to that one yet..  
---
Another legacy FO4 bug...   
---
I like the idea of the stagger and knockdown, but I think that's more QoL
---
Incredible dude. I hope your work and talent don't go unnoticed. 
---
I get that. I think I enjoy it more because my mom got me and my dad the game so we could get a little closer. Our relationship hasn't always been the best and this is an outlet for good conversations and team work between us. So for me it's more about that than the actual game. But it is getting better. Just give it time. Last time I played I didn't get kicked out at all and while still very laggy it was playable at least way more than in December.
---
I was wondering the same thing. I had to do it twice only because the first button didn't take my first run. 
---
Drop them in any container near the train station. People typically drop them inside. I‚Äôve gotten some new plans this way, it‚Äôs very nice when people do that
---
I have definitely shot those monkeys both on purpose and on accident when they scared tue bejeezus out of me.
---
Because Bethesda likes money and wouldn't pull that stunt. It's clear that this is their final product and the best they had to offer. As much as I'd want it all to be fake :(
---
Sorry bud, the "do nothing" option is literally built into the game. Its chosen by not playing Fallout 76, returning the game, and believeing in your head that your version of the world died completely.  
---
For everyone else, its about preventing Scorch Beasts from invading the rest of the world.  Just because they killed everyone in Virginia, you survived right? So obviously there is hope at least one other person did too and needs a vaccine.
---
Lmfao!!!
---
Suitcase at Whitespring Station with Skeleton on it has unlimited storage. I dead drop there daily for players to loot.
---
Yeah I basically got it to play with my brother who lives far away and is a huge fallout fan. Unfortunately we weren't able to find the fun in it you seem to have been able to. 
---
Good point about friends. It‚Äôs lonely out there
---
Could also be like a PvP mode. Raiders vs Responders set in the past, in it's own little instanced world.
---
*shrug*   
---
They will notice or they won't, but I can atleast claim I tried at the end of the day, when turning off the lights and locking the doors..
---
dunno, just look for me if im on!
---
I picked up the tricentennial version for $30 at Costco only because I knew how much that one reg costs, in hopes it would be fixed soon. Been too into AC to play yet though. 
---
The mannequins always freak me out.  My friend and I came upon a circle of mannequins with a supply drop in the center of them.
---
Hopefully in the future it becomes the game that it's meant to be and you can once again have fun.
---
There are sales going on, so it‚Äôs a good time. I‚Äôd recommend it if you have people to play with
---
if you don‚Äôt scrap wires before scrapping whatever is connected to them it will still read as taken budget. I think it‚Äôs the issue you can test yourself. You have to move the camp for it to get rid of the phantom wires
---
My Excavator PA Left Leg tends to "fall off" on occasion when hopping in and out of the PA.
---
Hey I'm on xbox Wildestknight18 if you want to add me
---
I've seen multiple comments saying that the stealth effect from the chameleon mutation is 5x stronger than from the armor, even though the visual's the same. I haven't seen evidence backing that claim though.
---
I also saw a comment that the mutation doesn't have the annoying beep noise that the armor effect has. That was a major reason that I abandoned chameleon on my first character.
---
But part of my 2nd character plan is to avoid a lot of the crutches that my first character had (besides repair), so using weaker, weightless armor would help reduce that god-mode feel but also give me a way out through stealth.
---
Damage avoidance, buddy. Not DR, avoidance. 
---
Take some QoL perks out and get some. 
---
There‚Äôs a big menu (with conditions)
---
- Lone Wanderer - 30% (if solo)
---
- Dodgy 30% (if you have 30AP to spare)
---
- Serendipity 45% (out of PA) / emergency protocols torso mod 50% (in PA) - if you‚Äôre at low health 
---
- Blocker 45% (From melee) 
---
- Sentinel legendary effect armor (15% apiece while standing)
---
- Cavalier legendary effect armor (15% apiece while sprinting)
---
- blocking legendary effect armor and weapons (15% apiece while blocking).
---
And except in a few places **they stack**.
---
I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I repair my armor maybe **once a week**, and I play &gt;4hrs daily. 
---
If repairing is hard, it‚Äôs probably because you‚Äôve entirely missed (or deliberately decided to sit out) the damage avoidance set of mechanics in the game. 
---
Yeah, I keep grabbing those also. I end up vendoring that junk most of the time. 
---
Michael, which designing woman did you base your accent on? 
---
Delta Burke, I do declare!
---
And OCDecorator. Please. That more than anything. 
---
OH you just reminded me that I have to go back to Lewisberg's graveyard and open all the safes now that I have lockpicking 3!
---
I didn't say it. I declared it.
---
It's nice that you found some fun \^\^ I haven't been so lucky. It's just felt very dead for me of late and I've not really found anything to do anymore.
---
Update mods if your running them.
---
These weekly events in the game give you the Exact same effects as the data mined lunch boxes. The events are tied to the atom shop, the lunch boxes are also tied to the atom shop. Seems to me, and some others here, that the story is BS because of that. Couple that with statements from people at Bethesda, mostly Pete Hines, saying there wouldn‚Äôt be loot boxes or any sort of pay to win in 76 (source: https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/damien-cox/bethesda-forgoes-loot-boxes-in-fallout-76-reiterating-that-microtransactions-arent-pay-to-win/ ) these facts alone leave the whole argument that pay to win/loot boxes are coming to 76 as nothing but unfounded speculation stemming from youtubers who have only shown that they really want the game to be bashed more than it already has.
---
I think 40. Today and yesterday I got 3* armor. 
---
Remove all your mods....    
---
**and before you claim your not using any, more than a couple people have claimed that then come back and admited they were after they finally gave up and tried removing them**.  
---
After you do, and edit your INI's to remove them from the load order edit, try and boot the game.  
---
Assuming it boots, check for updates for said mods...  
---
I know personally "show health" has been causing CTDs.  
---
After you've done that...  
---
Blow out your INI's, all of them, then do a file check, it will rebuild the needed core INI, and reconfigure your settings 
---
Two days ago i lost my shotgun, i wasnt in my pip boy and couldnt equip it from the weaponwheel, so i checked the inventory and it was gone, i instant knew it couse i had less weight in my inv then usual. Its not in the stash aswell, and not respawned after several reloggs
---
I realise you posted this a fair while ago, but you didn‚Äôt get much of a response, and I was thinking about making a post about this so...
---
I found this extremely intriguing. We naturally assume that everyone in the region died from the events prior to our release. We might wonder whether anyone got out. As far as I‚Äôm aware, this is the only snippet of lore that actually suggests a mass evacuation of sorts. Would be glad to learn of more. Nice to think that some of the ‚Äògood guys‚Äô got out.
---
That would be cool.
---
I mean: factioning your character as in other fallout games... But with other players chararacters factioned on its own. Killing someone from enemy factions would place a bounty on your head only for other players on that faction (and maybe on neutrals?)
---
"I honestly cant believe people play this game"
---
Ya so much rage there. You totally aren't grasping at straws to feels better about being an idiot lol.
---
I've heard of bed bugs but this is ridiculous
---
So if 3 people tag a mob, those 3 will see 3 different legendaries should they drop?
---
The story is in a pure Fallout fashion both desperately hopeless and plain crazy.
---
On one hand, you're chasing down leads on ways to protect yourself from and fight off this "Scorched" crisis that claimed all before you. So your leads are found in the journals and personal records of those who died fighting. Eventually you're forced into brokerage with raiders, then made to learn of the methods used to survive by various groups on the front against this terror and you find an answer in nuclear arms.
---
On the other hand you're trying to get through the DMV and participate in civil war reenactments. Alongside that, you're fighting hard against this massive Scorched threat when your character has no way of knowing that the world beyond Appalachia isn't like this, too. As far as we know in-game, the Vault 76 survivors are *all that is left of humanity. Not even MODUS can contact anyone anywhere, much to his surprise after getting Sugar Grove's comms accessed. For all intents and purposes our characters are probably feeling like none of it matters anyway, and no one's really around to judge...so fuck it. It'd be hard not to give in to the madness around them, so in a narrative sense, *they do*.
---
Now I'm doing it that way and something is not working. Gotta be a hitch here.
---
Ah same here. I'm hoping the release a lot of new content or in the next 6 months the game will die.
---
That's more or less your own fault for going into a situation unprepared
---
I have a camp equidistant between Harper's Ferry, Whitespring, and Watoga that I hop through to reduce fast travel costs. The order doesn't matter much. That''s 5 vendors.
---
Then on the west side I use the Flatwoods and Sutton Station vendors. You can get to Flatwoods cheaply by hopping to vault 76, or if you're already at the Whitespring you can go to Sutton first.
---
Yes. 3 separate but all 3 a disappointment.
---
For the gatling laser and gatling plasma with the right perks ammo is not a problem and for the 50 cal machine gun and gatling gun ammo is also not a problem. Damage is a huge problem on the energy weapons and the durability problems are terrible. 
---
One of the things I would really like to see is a high damage single shot heavy weapon. Something like an anti-material rifle, tesla cannon etc.
---
are u on rn?
---
Hoping for the best! I really am. The core concept of 76 is one I love. I badly want a good game like this. 76 just isn't that . . . yet.
---
Exactly, nothing about it is bullshit, not the complete lack of any substantial proof, not the complete denial of it from bethesda, not the repeated incorrect rumors that the people claiming it circulated before this one, absolutely nothing about it is bullshit... like at all... 
---
I'm experiencing a persistent issue on PC where picking up a weapon with the same name as one I already possess and that is bound to favourites wheel, then replaces that weapon the wheel. Meaning I can pick up a 'Marksman's Hardened Sniper Rifle' that is less damage than my favourited rifle and almost broken, and it replaces my optimised weapon on quick wheel. Attempting to re-add my good rifle to the wheel just results in the broken weapon being added instead. Issue only resolved when I scrap or transfer the broken rifle from inventory.
---
Also experienced a few occurrences of living targets being highlighted for a few mins after exiting trade screens. No PA, consumables or armour perks contributing. Not a problem as such, just odd.
---
They‚Äôre 100% suggestions. You‚Äôre losing any chance you‚Äôd have at people taking these seriously by including things that are essentially you disliking things that are by design. 
---
Westek
---
If you‚Äôve been attacking people for NOT liking it then you must be blind and incompetent because this game has been a mess since launch and continues to be a mess.
---
Nope, still no clue. My only lead is the super mutant vendor may have it.
---
Someone on here said this months ago, but it's so true.  Now, Bethesda, I repeat this quote with love, albeit the kind you might have for the odd-ball cousin in the family, but love none the less. 
---
"Fallout 76 is a pile of garbage, but it's the most fun you'll ever have with a pile of garbage."
---
OMG this happened to me the other day! I joined the event from the map and just ended up inside.  My brother was playing with me and tried to fast travel to me but arrived outside of the vault unable to get in.  
---
I didn't even know the extent was inside the vault so when I spawned i was like,  "where the fuck am i even?  Is this a vault? "
---
Like a really nice hooded assassin look, something like this but with a mask that only goes over the mouth so I can keep the patrolman sunnies and a longer coat.
---

---
The castle build set would be great too.  Just generally more "survival" feeling clothes, all the good wasteland ones are tattered rags.
---
are we gonna tell him? 
---
Finally got it. Something weird with the buttons not registering.
---
Never used white knight. Genuinely dont understand the outrage
---
Thank you this is the second time i was wanted and never payed attention to it until now,thought it was a visual bug or everyone really left lol.Im still enjoying it thou.
---
They're also joined by people who want the game to succeed.
---
This^ it‚Äôs got to be one of the dumbest, least thought through thing about this game.
---
I want new content and a quick pass on heavy energy weapons to make them something I can actually take with me and use in playing that content. The balance does not have to be perfect on them but at the very least they should last 5 to 10 clips of ammo and their damage should be a little higher.
---
More like a structured objective based PvP mode, rather than just the normal pvp that we currently have. So each team has a set of objectives to complete while killing each other. Raiders are raiding Charleston. Responders are defending it against the Raiders. There could be a bunch of structured pvp modes like capture the flag, domination, etc. like WoW battlegrounds and other FPS modes.
---
Buying them on the market 
---
Man I've played it for 2-3 hrs every night since Christmas, it's more enjoyable than the posts on here suggest.
---
Fact: Bethesda hired over 200 employees for their troll farm to combat the negative press from fallout 76.
---
They don‚Äôt care about developing the game, this is all about a quick cash grab to bolster yearly profits and its backfiring 
---
Same thing! A friend and I both joined the same event at the same time and spawned us in there. When we realised, we went exploring. 
---
Me too, and that makes me sad because I was so hype..
---
Unless the lootboxes arrive in the future.
---
I have trouble buying that someone decided every weapons get a linked weight reduction perk BUT rifles, but assuming your right...   
---
Regarding the springs / screws, How do we know, if the Dev's don't respond, if they are removed content or broken?   
---
I make the assumption CT = cut, but I don't know for sure.   
---
What armor do you have on?
---
Be careful Bethesda will bring t60 up to other power armor. Since what you said makes t60 a must PA. 
---
Wish they made you press CTRL-Attack to force an attack like they do in most pk mmos.
---
124 
---
500 hrs
---
Ps4
---
tses are shit now dont bother with them
---
Not to mention probably the worst shuffling algorithm I have ever seen. I shuffled Alduin into my deck at the start and he was the second card i drew. Like... What?
---
Mind posting a screenshot? 
---
**Without** the perk, when I go to repair something, the cost is 5 ballistic fiber and 6 screws (among other things), rank 1 of White Knight brings that down to 4 and 4, rank 2 to 3 and 3, and rank 3 drops it to 2 and 2. I find it hard to believe you're 6-6 *with* the perk, when it doesn't even cost that much without it. 
---
Here's *my* screenshots: [no White Knight](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/388410058352099329/543903491127640075/Fallout_76_Screenshot_2019.02.09_-_21.17.19.90.png) and [White Knight Rank 3](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/388410058352099329/543903504276652042/Fallout_76_Screenshot_2019.02.09_-_21.17.45.15.png)
---
you think I'm a fucking idiot?  I don't get my info from YouTube...  what effects are you referring to?  the datamined info suggest some effects you get from the lunchboxes are damage boosts and xp boosts, neither of which are rewarded from events...
---
either way here's a link to where my info is coming from...
---
[Fallout 76's lunch boxes sure sound like the loot boxes it was never going to have](https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76s-lunch-boxes-sure-sound-like-the-loot-boxes-it-was-never-going-to-have/)

Im on now if you guys wanna team up
---
Good, now I have a reason to wear my wood armor
---
It also spawns on the fork in the road right below Graphton Train Station.
---
Nope not there
---
I was trading with a player near my camp, we were attacked by super mutants, she killed one. Apparently it was ‚Äúmine‚Äù and so she was marked wanted
---
It's ok.
---
Lvl 127 - lil over 300 hours. Xb1
---
Hell i sometimes get it as a reward for taking a workshop.
---
This sub is going to tell you to stay away as its primarily filled with at launch people bitter from the sloppy release, and, bored people who are  level 100. 
---
Not exactly the most motivating of communities and definitely biased towards this games failure. 
---
That said, I think it's a good game and I'm pretty casual, bought it for 30, and started playing on pc on Jan 11th.
---
yeah. Its hard to know for sure though.
---
Lvl 111 - xb1 - hours unsure - no longer playing.
---
Lurking the sub waiting for better days
---
People can only defend the game for so long with nothing to show for it.
---
Ontop of everything else a lot of players just have had enough,the rarity of fusion cores,the absolute uselessness of energy and explosive weapons,the change to resource nodes adding another step and requiring you to farm acid,nerfs to XP,nerfs too loot,nerfs to legendary drop rate.  
---
People just saw another round of nerfs and said fuck it im out.  
---
There is no hiding or denying a lot of the nerfs have been solely to extend the game play loop.
---
Mothman asks you to tell him story. 
---
Also honestly,'even if they are suggestions, the 30+ other bugs are invalidated by those two?
---
Stupid Mothman; it's a C.A.M.P. not a L.A.M.P.
---
Not Using any! :(
---
&gt;Of course the people still playing and butthurt are too stupid to think.
---
"Of course the people still playing and butthurt are too stupid to think."
---
"Idiots and douches still play this game and you are both."
---
I was playing Warframe last night and I got a message during a mission that a Hotfix was inbound in less than 3 minutes. I was a little disappointed that I wasn‚Äôt notified earlier or I wouldn‚Äôt have gone in the mission. As the time got closer, I was fully prepared to get booted. Next thing I know, in the lower right corner is says ‚ÄòApplying Hotfix now, please don‚Äôt leave your mission.‚Äô I was floored. I‚Äôve never seen a game so that before, then afterwards it requested you restart at your earliest convenience. It was amazing. 
---
Don‚Äôt listen to these introverts telling you not to buy the game unless you have friends to play it with.... what kind of shit is that? IMO the one natural redeeming quality this game has is the forced interaction and role play. I‚Äôm not a big role player and I haven‚Äôt really interacted with other gamers outside of my group of friends since around 2010 but this game forced me to interact with people and led to very very interesting situations. I made a lot of friends and got lots of help from people and had tons of fun along the way. 
---
One thing to note: they recently nerfed a bunch of things in game and about half of the community was very upset because it apparently made the game much more tedious and annoying. I haven‚Äôt played since then but I may give it a try today. Lots of people I know quit because of this reason. The game is also still an absolute buggy mess, and there‚Äôs no denying that, regardless of what any of these people on here try to tell you. If you have never played a really bad beta / unstable game it would probably be overwhelming for you in all honesty. 
---
Enforcer is the most important and it is located in the Agility tree. 
---
The quad double barrel is fantastic if you mod it with a Hardened Reciever, you can get 214 (?) DMG per shot  it holds 8 rounds and uses the basic 2 shot reload animation. Vats/Crits this do death against mobs and SB's . Gun Fu works well too once you lock onto headshots!
---
Quest: Search for survivors
---
Me: Lol
---
I'm level 37 on PS4. There's a lot I don't know about the game but I enjoy it. I wish it were easier to find people to play with. Not sure how many hours I've put in but I got it for Christmas and started playing shortly after that. 
---
Went there today.  Got one pouch.
---
I wouldn't worry man. I had my camp build next to the gorge junkyard for weeks. Everytime I logged on the first thing I'd do is take it over and then defend it. Literally never anyone came and took it from me. 
---
&gt; complete lack of any substantial proof 
---
tf are you talking about?  literal code was datamined...
---
they haven't released (the lunchboxes) and the code is still in the game files, and the code suggests xp boosts and damage boosts, so if they released and cost atoms, they would be pay to win, so how is it bullshit?  literally the only reason you all are saying it's bullshit is because they haven't released yet, but they might still, I doubt it, I bet they were supposed to be released already but as soon as dataminers found the proof and there was an uproar they probably decided against adding them...  the *only* way they are not pay to win is if they are rewards for missions/events...
---
so again, how is this bullshit?
---
bethesda has moved on to other projects and a skeleton crew is doing the absolute bare minimum.
---
i'll wait until evidence is presented to me that says otherwise.
---
We don't even need a fast travel mat. Once you've place your CAMP, you can move the item CAMP (the box thingy) within the boundaries of your settlement like any other item. (not using MOVE CAMP, but the hold and move button, which is E on pc).
---
Just let us fast travel to this thing instead of a certaindistance away from it.
---
Thanks a lot, I‚Äôve added this to the post.
---
What does IRL friends have to do with him buying the game and playing with other people in the community? Do you follow everything your friends do?
---
Not using any mods for F76!
---
Um no. Completely different.
---
Mine's a cliffside house (shack) right next to a pond but the problem is there's random tough enemies like Mirelurk Deep Kings, Yao Guai Bastards, etc, right next to me. Whenever I fast travel home I'm outside of my walls and am sometimes attacked and killed without having control of my character. _Especially_ troubling when spawning home, because the game sometimes makes you stand still for a minute while it draws the damn map
---
Ya those were responses to stupid things said to me. You lost?
---
There's an unused in-game animation of opening a lunch box, confetti blasting and a message coming up about the reward. Also "open around friends" to share the fun.
---
Then there's also the removed Christmas and New year's presents BGS were going to give out but never did.
---
It could be lootboxes, which we know are a crazy monetised income for video games these days, but after are the bad press they stayed  their hand. Or it could be some other bonus item that was never fully developed so not implemented. In game reward with different effects.
---
Lunchboxes were definitely going to be a thing though 
---
You are proof you survived. Apart from that everyone else who leaves any breadcrumb or semblance of life actually turns up dead. What reason is there for thinking, or even hoping, that anyone else is alive? What makes that guy in Florida more resilient than the residents of Appalachia?
---
I have thousands, even after mass crafting and scrapping handmades for mods. People would have to be doing some serious crafting to be low on screws.
---
For anyone struggling, remember to equip super duper when crafting weapons and armor.
---
Main lv 194, combined lv 226 across 3 characters.  This is on Xbox.  I have a lvl 90 on PC.  Probably a combined 500 hours across both platforms.  Probably shouldn't play as much as I do.
---
that and killing the assaultrons in White springs and with luck based perks you can find them in containers   
---
Right now the best way to combat the bug is to use LT and RT as it goes by larger increments, and is also a lot quicker.
---
Both
---
&gt; The locations with enemies change based on players.
---
But not based on which quests they have completed. There is literally no world-based impact to doing anything, apart from Scorched Earth. And even that sorts itself out rather quickly.
---
&gt;Even Skyrim has a lack of choices for the main quest.
---
But it has a clearly defined reason why **you** have to do those things. In Fallout 76 you are not 'the One'.
---
&gt;Just because 76 doesn't have all the choices someone wants, doesn't mean the story is bad.
---
The story has precisely zero choices, apart from the choice between doing it or not doing it at all.
---
Nice counterargument, I completely forgot that criticism is only valid if you've done better. Please tell all the game critics, who rated this game below 50 on metacritic, as well because they and almost everyone else who played this game must be wrong that this game runs, looks and plays like shit, you dumb fanboy fuck.
---
so they are basically Hitler 
---
Only if you name your C.A.M.P. the "Titty Twister"
---
Moth man: ‚ÄúOh wow.. uhh.. okay. You‚Äôre home early.‚Äù
---
*slowly gets off bed, grabs his coat and leaves without saying anything else*
---
Maybe they thought it was funny to make the perk that affects junk, work like junk.
---
Get it?
---
Lvl 150, 300 hours, one character, haven‚Äôt played in a few days unfortunately. 
---
I‚Äôm a harsh critic of the game and I am basically done with it at this point, but I will say if you actually tried to interact with people you‚Äôd find it‚Äôs really not that lonely. 
---
I get that some of you aren‚Äôt comfortable with playing with and talking to strangers but in fairness that‚Äôs not all of us and that‚Äôs not an accurate representation of the game or community. 
---
if you are on xbox I can help you with marsupial, grounded as I can craft those. I can trade with another guy that has the other two but he wont be online until after 5pm est. I charge 200 per.
---
 Incisor and what it does to The Sword of Bastet. ;)
---
It also seems that it wasn't all written by the same people, some parts seem well written yet other parts seem like they were written by a random Intern.
---
And Don't get me started on the Overseer holotapes.
---
How about this, your next kid, the name you give is the name i wanted to give mine... i have absolutely no way of knowing what your gonna name your kid... i can look through you social media accounts and get an idea of what i think you might name it, based off family members or even just random ideas, or maybe you‚Äôve talked about it hypothetically, but i know 100% you‚Äôre gonna name your kid what i wanted to name mine, because you stole it from me... even though you don‚Äôt have that kid yet and it isn‚Äôt born, i know your gonna name it the name i wanted, so based off that fact... i‚Äôm suing you...

Why would you waste your time getting the odd used core when you can get 8 per hour per power plant? If you get all 3 plants you‚Äôll get 24 cores per hour, fully charged. That‚Äôs one every 2.5 minutes on average.
---
Probably furious with an attack speed buff.
---
Trivial roleplaying stuff ? This game is literally an ORPG. With a company as massive as BGS and the team behind, is it not alright to assume they can work on patches *and* more game relative content for the players who are enjoying the game ? Sure, the bugs and DCs are crippling as hell but there are plenty of people still playing the game but just want a little more camp stuff to help their rp experience.
---
I just stay in Power armor low repair cost and 675 carry weight 
---
Level 165, 210 hours. Stopped playing. Waiting for new content.
---
Buy them off players
---
I can craft all serums on xbox - 250c each
---
Back on in about an hour and a half
---
No, there is no urgency, and there is not going to be. For them, this is a side show, a way to make a little money in exchange for a crew getting some much needed experience. But they are not, and never will, dump money into this game to speed development. There will never be additions to the crew, unless they cycle in some folks to get more of said training.
---
The game will probably get better, but expecting it to get better any time soon is a silly notion. BGS is rarely all that fast to begin with, and as people have loudly and unceasingly pointed out, this game is not all that popular. That's why I've been advising people to wait until at least till may before reinstalling if they grow vexed, because I doubt real additions will happen before then.
---
Great solution! I‚Äôm sure Bethesda is gonna get right on this! 
---
Never knew that! Good stuff.
---
Not really. Even at 8 per hour, it‚Äôs pretty high. I guess the only reason it is so high is because there aren‚Äôt legendary power armor pieces yet.
---
With the exception of a few family members, I didn't have any real life friends that played. Now I have a very nice group of friends I play with on a daily basis. You CAN meet friends in game to play with!! I have played every fallout game from the beginning. Even with the bugs and the frustrating nerfs, I still enjoy FO76... my husband played solo until around level 35ish..maybe 40.. then he started playing with the group I played with. 
---
The game is a lot of fun if you can deal with the nerfs and bugs. 
---
Btw I'm level 119 and still play daily.. 
---
Haha epic 
---
You don't need them to craft regular stimpaks
---
Definitely, this was my main fiber run awhile back. Much less passive, much more interesting... but people keep thinking this stuff is rare?
---
 So 2 x 55 is 110. ;) Over 500 is as close as I can come. My game runs in Widows and I only go there for that reason. so I can't look right now.
---
 I have not done quests not played the game to do anything other that develop those 2 chars. They are good now, and one my a Trader Jenny Jones and the other, Nasrudin hunts Scorchbeasts for sport. 
---
Just claim a power plant. You‚Äôre wasting your time getting them from random suits.
---
157 still nothing for a couple explosive and a few two shot but never both 
---
When you can find them. I do interact, I try and make friends on the casual sub, but I hardly ever find people
---
When i need ammo i just farm the Eastern Regional Penitentiary for tincan traps. Way more effective then taking workshops.
---
They‚Äôre only for super stims 
---
I was thinking A. Yes it's somewhat immersion breaking, but it would be way more fun.
---
Yeah I dont know why. I had over 500 at one point. It's pretty easy to find if you know the spots. 
---
You‚Äôd be the only one then. It was fixed quite a while ago. I once relogged 30-40 times to fully charge all my cores, now it never works.
---
you do realize that Excavator can boost your carry weight by 300 first time log on extra 100 calibrated shocks 100 with the 600 camp storage I don't know why people are complaining is 1275 storage not enough 
---
You might want to keep this post ready to link for support in case your account is flagged for accessing an unreachable area, and perhaps submit a bug report for the event bug.
---
Absolutely understandable if that‚Äôs your view. Like I said before, I never experienced any griefers but mileage may vary
---
There's several XBox groups. You're best bet is to check one of them.
---
that analogy is so messed up, I don't even know where to begin...
---
first, there is literal data in the code, it's there, do your research, second, wtf even is this analogy!?!
---
Lvl 42. About 80 hours played. I jump on for an hour or 2 when I get the chance. I haven't even done many of the missions or side quests. Usually just hope on take a workshop and then explore a bit. Going to wait until lvl 45 and then finally finish the miners miracles quest and get some excavator power armour    (even though I hate wearing power armour)
---
and? you mentioned additions, not plans for additions.
---
Learn to use other guns.
---
I one shot any player I'm in combat with/ wanted player.
---
With Anti-armor 1 star lever action.
---
Same. I've found 4 explosive weapons and maybe 10 two shot guns. Never a tse. I'm at about lvl 125.
---
Didn't know, thanks for the heads up.
---
Im level 80. I dont know where to check for playtime tbh. 
---
There's a motherlode in the main room but you'll get twice as many more from just checking every single desk and office.
---
PS don't forget to pick up pencils 
---
If this was a thing then if you claim someone else‚Äôs workshop the parts of it shouldn‚Äôt disappear just go into the previous owners stores tab 
---
I'd venture a guess that about 95 pct of the tse's are duped. 
---
I play power armor because I need that 1275 storage I love that 300 bonus excavator gives you  
---
Definitely agree this seems to make things much better stability wise.
---
Devs should literally starve to death for being so insanely stupid. Lock them in cells to think about what they‚Äôve done.
---
I'd like to also point out its platforming, one of the original and staple genres of video games... Yeah you can take it slow and still make it with plenty of time. 
---
Getting them from plaErs who have plans. Seems the cheapest. I got mine with just standing in rads. I got 7 really useful and stopped, only bought speed serum bc i already had many mutations i didnt wanna risk getting herbivore or empath. 
---
[I genuinely don't see what the big deal is.](https://i.imgur.com/p9U4YEx.png)
---
I believe what they mean is that somewhere in the world people are still alive and if nothing is done about the scorched then that will hange.  As FO76 characters we know of at least three groups of people that are still alive.  You have the other people from
---
 Vault 76,  you have the people who are still in locked up vaults, and you have the Brotherhood of Steel in California (you learn that the BoS was in contact with the founders of the BoS in California for some time through a satelllite connection, but after sometime that satellite burned up and they lost connection)
---
5 minutes into Wasteland Survival Guide and chill and he gives you this look
---
I only log in to sell stuff and to do the odd trade so if it ever grabs my interest again I‚Äôll have caps and decent gear.
---
Wait you can buy AND craft them? 
---
Mind blown.
---
Thanks for the offer but I‚Äôm on PS4
---
thanks!
---
Buy Fallout: New Vegas with Gun Runners Arsenal DLC. That was really cool. :o)

Or at least the option to return to previous world. That would be immensely helpful. Let‚Äôs say you died and your server crashes mid world entering, you‚Äôve just lost all of your junk. Irritating af. 
---
very true, I know.
---
No, they were a plan that you could learn, and then you could build one in your CAMP.  But they took it out after like, the 3rd BETA session. I personally never even saw it on PC, only xbox
---
It is bed time Br√∂ther
---
Workshops have their own pool of resources to build things.  Building a fusion generator gather some fusion cores I only used like a dozen aluminum and nuclear waste out of my own stash to build it.
---
So I never called you stupid, no need to get all offended. As well since you have evidently not played the game recently I‚Äôll bring you up to speed, shortly after the new year bethesda started implementing weekly events (no not the public events in game that you seem to think of) these events are tied to the atom shop and use the timer that certain ‚Äúlimited time sale‚Äù items have as to measure and set when the events effects will start and last till (no purchase needed to activate them) and these events are advertised on the main menu, the first of these being ‚Äúchild‚Äôs play‚Äù outlined here, https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agfu5d/childs_play_event_tested_and_dissected/?st=JRXZY3R4&amp;sh=82d62fa6 
---
The TLDR of it is that toys in your inventory grant a radiation resistance buff to the player. There‚Äôs been others since, one gave you buff at night, I believe to either XP earned or Damage resistance (could be wrong about the effect). Most recently one Of the weekly events gave team members buffs to health for wearing similar superhero related outfits (mistress of mysteries garb type outfits). All of the effects given during these weekly events are the exact same ones given from the lunch boxes that people data mined. This led myself and others to conclude that the lunches boxes data mined and the consumable lunch boxes with animations found in the dev room people cheated into, were placed there for testing purposes to see if the effects worked. The article you‚Äôve linked is quite old and is the exact claim I‚Äôm debunking with this post. It‚Äôs speculation that‚Äôs turned into misinformation. 
---
Content wise totally not worth it. Fallout wise, yeah its pretty fun. 
---
The occasional bethesda rep on Reddit sometimes have human responses, even cute or funny, but of course nothing ever come from the "I'll pass on to dev team" etc.
---
if you have the fusion core generator you don't have that problem just claim the work shop and you will be given all the materials to build a fusion genny   
---
I rarely get disconnected.  What system are you using? Wifi or wired? Connection speed? NAT type?
---
Ohh what‚Äôs duck-tape? Is that some kind of sticky duck bill?
---
The total condition bar goes up (to a limit; currently believed to max at 25int) and that also gives you a higher overrepair limit. Unproven yet if that actually gives you a higher total overrepair armor bonus, or if it just means you lose the bonus slower due to the larger bar.
---
I would enjoy the game a thousand times more if they added npcs I understand the original design philosophy, but to see a occasional caravan or trader crew traveling through Appalachia or the factional npcs / raiders coming back vrying for territiory would open so much more possibilties with 76
---
Do you have a chameleon chest piece? 
---
&gt; literally no reason to play the game after you beat the story mode.
---
It's literally a Fallout game, not some fucking mmo? The game *should* be over after you finish the story content.
---
Ah so you need evidence for one conclusion but not another one.
---
Starting to feel like I'm in r/worldpolitics
---
its so common but than again I used to complain about Springs before I invested in Intelligence Perks now I have like a 1000 springs  
---
Is there source or proof ? Or just angry Joe's assumptions in your head ...
---
I like the idea and have had the thought myself. I see a problem with it. Players like me. I have gotten really good at making it near to, if not actually impossible to take a workshop from me. So much to the point that if I were to get kicked and log back into the server I would not be able to reclaim it while it was unowned. 
---
The best chance another player has to take a workshop from me is while I‚Äôm building it. If I‚Äôm allowed to store my creations and drop them like my camp it would put very one else at a disadvantage. Maybe if the individual pieces were stored and retained but not built structures and I was forced to re-place each individual item, then it would be fair. I like winning, but part of that sense of winning the the thrill of the rush to put up my defenses. 
---
I‚Äôm not disagreeing with that, I‚Äôm pointing out how these weekly events seem to share the effects of the lunchboxes in there. I do agree that at one point the lunch boxes were probably meant to be used as a group buff of sort that could be found or earned, but I think they were cut out and remade into the effects we see in weekly events now. I believe the footage of the lunchbox being opened in the dev room and used is probably no more than a method for developers to test the effects that events offer before they go live. 
---
And LT2 4 times to go fast to 1 unit.
---
Or just realistic...
---
Has this been confirmed to work? 
---
That‚Äôs TNT dome 2, and I think it‚Äôs (sort of) an Area 51-Esque research site on aliens. 
---
Exactly what I was thinking.
---
You can get 300-400 lbs increase from excavator armor. The normal 100 increase, the 100 increase from two calibrated shocks, the 100 glitch increase you get 98% of the time upon logging in with the power armor equipped (every now and then, very rarely, it doesn‚Äôt work so just relog again) and the other 100 glitch increase that you get seemingly randomly. If you die or exit the power armor, it goes back to normal. 
---
I have the fast travel mat stuck in my stashed objects and I can‚Äôt place it anymore. BRING IT BACK!
---
thank you for bringing receipts, you are right, I did stop playing, so I was unaware, thank you for explaining it to me.  I will grant that this probably means they repurposed their luchbox idea and we probably won't see paid for lunchboxes in the future, but that doesn't mean they didn't intend to release the lunchboxes as pay to win microtransactions, I stated elsewhere that it's likely they were planning to do just that but changed course when the dataminers blew the whistle, which in no way means the original story is bullshit...  all it means is Bethesda wisened up and decided against their initial microtransaction plan...
---
Also, Class Freak perk reduces the negative effects of mutations by 25%, 50%, 75% 
---
&gt;the game is literally nothing like fallout 4 at all besides some recycled mechanics, animations and textures
---
Because that's all they have in the game. The holotapes and whatnot make a decent story (voice acting is really good), and that's why I said OP can likely get some good hours out of it. But after that, it is *literally* just FO4 with more trees that you can play with friends (until your server crashes). They even made a mod to add mutations to FO4. 
---
Not everyone is me and my friends but every other post on this reddit for the past 2 months has shared a similar sentiment. Don't blame me for your confusion as to why you play a game you hate every day. I didn't at all claim my opinion was absolute, but it is damn well more typical of the community than yours, ya nonsensical weirdo.
---
Sugar Grove and WhiteSprings is better for springs Gouls drop allot of pocket watches and Gettyup buttercups in the houses are never looted also clipboards at sugar grove I have my house next to Harpers Ferry so I can have cheap fast travel to sugar grove and Watoga  
---
Only an hour a day! You need a YouTube channel 
---
While there are still some bugs, it's not as bad as it was. It is playable now.. 
---
My husband, 4 of our kids and I all play together along with some amazing friends I've met in game. We really enjoy it. Plus added bonus my kids like to brag to their friends that their mom plays video games WITH them!!! 
---
Grahm, Rose and MODUS, right? Because I can't think of anything else that would qualify as an NPC.
---
You might doing something wrong. Im using a standart max modded hunting rifle and i can one shot lvl 98 scorched. Sneak perks, tank killer and bloody mess included. Specialize your perks into your build and you wont have much problems except with stronger enemies. 
---
If you use the L1 button to go past 0(to the left)  and just keep clicking it like 5 times it will get to . I think it goes to 1250 and then the next click sets it to 0
---
&gt;I believe what they mean is that somewhere in the world people are still alive and if nothing is done about the scorched then that will change.
---
Is this ever shown in the story? 
---
&gt;As FO76 characters we know of at least three groups of people that are still alive. You have the other people from Vault 76
---
Who don't need your help, because they are out doing the same thing you are.
---
&gt;you have the people who are still in locked up vaults
---
With no indication they are alive
---
&gt;and you have the Brotherhood of Steel in California (you learn that the BoS was in contact with the founders of the BoS in California for some time through a satelllite connection, but after sometime that satellite burned up and they lost connection).
---
With no indication that California is still even there.
---
Is there anything that you can do in the game, or any story component, which gives any indication at all that there is someone out there to be saved?
---
Not anymore. Armor rating is bugged. One scorchbeast will drain your stims quickly but 2-3 will fucking destroy you.
---
I think that would make it an even more fun End Game thing, especially in conjunction with a faction system. It might be challenging and require multiple players to take you on. Wouldn't that be fun?
---
Gimme your stuff
---
Warframe a free to play game at that. Is very good to patch fix and balance things quickly
---
Im still having fun playing it. Havent found all locations. 
---
Define period and feel? Because if you want survival games Ark is a good one.
---
I‚Äôve always had issues with that. If I‚Äôm not selling it, I just drop it into a bag and let them pick it up.. as long as it doesn‚Äôt fall into eternity and disappear. 
---
So your mad a survival game is treating you like it is a survival game?
---
Cards don‚Äôt stack. If one person on a team is sharing ghoulish, the other person sharing that perk isn‚Äôt helping anyone.
---
Also the main reason people don‚Äôt use regular armor is because of the repair cost.
---
They don‚Äôt.
---
You should only wear this when shopping at vendors to counter those folks who are too impatient for you to finish selling. BUT don't do this in the bunker...!
---
Bought a tse dragon from a friend and tse handmade from player vendors. 
---
Does no one search the wealth of posts about these topics before posting? It was in Beta, removed cuz Bethesda has proven to not care bout this game.
---
Bye. Nobody cares

&gt;I again just barely see as an approaching Scorched is shot over my shoulder with some sort of blue beam
---
Gauss rifle?
---
I don‚Äôt sadly. Sorry 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm continually amazed that hey have such a great game and constant support and still don‚Äôt require you to spend a dime
---
If you go into the challange section in the menu you can find it there. There is one for 76000 hours played. As long as you have less than that you can see your time played. 
---
Meh the workshops are so so. If we stopped DCing so much.
---
They'd be nicer.
---
\-
---
Also why ammo plant?
---
Get grafton steel yard.
---
You get everything there to make both energy &amp; ballistic ammo. (Besides Gunpowder/ plastic)
---
((Which gunpowder is in plenty right up north of the workshop.))
---
You also get exp for crafting the ammo.
---
Bye hoe
---
Depends on your attitude.  I think it has improved.  How ever it seems many people aren't aware of what a survival game is like. Nor how babied they are in this game compared to other survival games.
---
Thanks, I'll submit a bug report just to cover my butt!
---
What a good soul, you are. 
---
"Mom says it's my turn on the xbox"
---
Thank god I have fire insurance.
---
*any* is clearly an exaggeration. there are builds, not necessarily melee, that would destroy your pea shooter.
---
not to mention your experience is not a good justification as to why tses had to be nerfed to the ground while melee can still casually hit for 10K+
---
Can confirm, I have a 3 year old that hates going to bed on time.
---
Kinda looking foward to running into a player raider, only other players I met gave me gifts. 
---
All melee.  
---
Well now I want a baby mothman that follows you around like a pet 
---
So, you were using an OP, too powerful TSE gun.  Then a patch nerfs it, and now you‚Äôre not OP anymore but bitching about a different build that is now killing you in one shot instead of you killing someone in one shot.

Was that a question???
---
They're rare, as are SM Suicider's. Seen one of each since BETA. Has a Behemoth attack the abandoned town workshop while I was trying to claim it. End up having to spam stims and a melee weapon to take it down because I was out of ammo when it arrived.
---
There have been both from the beginning.
---
No worries
---
Completely agree BUT you know how hard it is to find meat piles out in the mire... I'm lucky to find any of them after a big queen fight. It would be so nice if they would add some sort of indicator on their corpses.
---
PvP servers can‚Äôt wait I don‚Äôt want to attack people but I‚Äôd like someone to attack me raider style.
---
But it is an mmo. Why do you think you play online with people?
---
Its really not that hard to get screws and ballistic fiber. I sell excess screws all the time. You just have to tag stuff and make sure you are picking things up. 
---
I have a lot but I haven‚Äôt been able to find some lately. I‚Äôve also noticed that my cores are dying much quicker. 
---
My main is at Level 131, I've played about 300 hours.

My alt is at level 20 something.

For a native German speaker like myself, the spelling 'faschnacht' really hurts the eyes. I do accept that Bethesda put the misspelling into the game in the first place, but just so you know, the event is either spelled 'Fasnacht' or 'Fassnacht'. Although someone from the southern parts of Germany might pronounce it 'fashnakht' due to the regional dialects, no one I ever met would ever write it like Bethesda did. Even the (website)[http://helvetiawv.com/events/fasnacht/fasnacht.htm] the OP linked to doesn't.
---
But enough with the anal rant! This is what the masks are called in the game, and we'll need to stick to the spelling so that we're all on the same page. :-/
---
That's really not how it works. You're carrying on their work, they died and there's unfinished business, they were rebuilding Appalachia and you're just carrying out what they couldn't do because of the schorched.
---
Aye, that's what I meant by "Your build state is saved as soon as you lose control of the workshop": the shit you built goes into your "Stored" tab but the placed objects remain; upon retaking the workshop the game checks what's currently placed and updates your "Stored" tab accordingly.
---
It isn‚Äôt limited to showing up at the Charleston Train Station.
---
It is one of the random encounters that appears on the road between the Charleston Fire Department and Riverside Manor.  Here is a photo of me next to it there after buying the Union Hat from it.
---

And another time I found it in the same spot (but with nothing worth selling).
---
https://twitter.com/revkeithps4/status/1091211439816097792?s=21
---
I also ran into it while walking on the train tracks from the Forest to Grafton Station, but it and the Brahmin simply fell over and died when I got close to it. The two surviving eyebots simply hovered around the corpses...

I still like the game
---
Start with what is nearest to your camp. Go to the nearest option to that location. Return to camp if you have to cross the map.
---
I have my camp right outside watoga, so I hit those two, up to the ferry, across to Top of the World, down to Whitesprings/MODUS, then to (charlston? Not sure which it is) nearest responder. Then back to camp for free.
---
Camp McClintock is good for it as well. I‚Äôve learned all the points and I can run through it in about 5 minutes 
---
I've killed players in ultracite armor around lv 100.
---
It's not hard.
---
Anti-armor is superior.
---
If I have a few hours in the game I can do the power plant route, but I am usually only paying for short sessions.
---
Storm chaser.
---
Level 45 armor is even better I have all the Power Armor perks and Calibrated shocks my Excavator carry weight is 675  
---
That article was a rush of flashbacks to the excitement I had for this game pre-release. Sad it didn't add up to what it was supposed to be. 
---
If you‚Äôre bored or just want something remotely fun playing, I‚Äôd say yes. If you‚Äôre a serious player who wants a super immersive game, no. Lvl 60 and it‚Äôs getting tedious. Personally, I would have rather started now than before January. I have a shotgun build and it was all nerfed. So now I have to essentially rebuild my current character, cause I‚Äôll be damned to start over. Too much work. Regardless, it‚Äôs fun and irritating all at the same time. 
---
They need to nerf melee or buff everything else. I would suggest buffing because I'm not a jerk like the melee builds that demanded TSE get nuked.
---
Buffs could include, making perception/agility/strength scale damage to rifles/pistols/heavy weapons as they do with strength and melee. 
---
Others ideas is to remove weapon damage falloff over range or increase the effective range. 
---
Right, I'm not worthy of life for my opinion regarding intellectual real estate
---
Seek help.
---
Bethesda could release a literal turd for $60 and you would still find a way to praise them, have you no shame? 
---
It‚Äôs not the crafting stations, it‚Äôs the stash. Stuff in your stash sometimes ‚Äúcounts‚Äù but isn‚Äôt ‚Äúavailable‚Äù until you open/remove/add stuff to the stash.
---
Maybe? I've only used laser rifles on my other character so far, as I'm trying to keep him mostly shotgun. I think it a mix of four separate but tight beams, like with a splitter mod. I think I saw both blue and white in the shots.
---
I switched my build to a sniper and with AA guns, it really still works fine. I run around in no power armor and rarely get killed from a melee attack. It probably WILL get nerfed though.
---
dont do this to yourself its embarrassing 
---
The four times I‚Äôve run into the bot, it‚Äôs never had Longellow‚Äôs ‚Äúhunter‚Äôs longcoat‚Äù. I did buy a Union Hat from it once.
---
Yeah I was wondering where the 10 masks they mentioned in the doc were too, scoured Helvetia for them. 
---
Came to a similar conclusion that you did; they're probably going to be enabled on the real life date of Faschnacht. There's also a note about the Helvetia protectrons, that includes "The robots will now decide on their own how often we celebrate Faschnacht" and "Just don't come to me if the robots choose to have a party every single day until the end of the world" which might imply the event (if there is one) can happen several times, or for an extended period of time. 
---
^^^if anyone would like to see the definition of irony
---
a big thing that helped me was not repairing things until they were near broke.  i used to repair if it was close to 33% or more damaged.
---
Never said you weren't worthy of life mate just said you're useless because you spend ya days critiquing genuinely nice and wholesome posts 
---
Yea I have been doing that but yknow gotta switch it up. Make the game knamean?
---
Because they always forget their victories. TSE weapons, lever action reloads, dupe tricks, every time they actually fix a complaint, that subject suddenly vanishes in favor of whatever the next complaint is. You're think people who be pants shittingly happy they're finally gonna fix the SB Screech Spam, but no! The non-patch-note small detail ItV does not have enough! I guess this is all that's getting patched!
---
I check in here about once a week to see about the latest news, and each week I remind myself why I don't visit any other time.
---
Even with TSE before the patch it atleast took 2 to shots 3 tho. But I guess I'll be switching to melee anyway takes way less resources and always has stable damage output.
---
Remove scorchbeast lol. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll always let you choose money or your life
---
It's embarrassing to state facts?
---
Just had that happen too, on PC. it really helped me keep Adrenalin up, I like! 
---
I got the expected shit... yay for a 1* suppressor‚Äôs sickle!
---
I had to actually do the course. There‚Äôs checkpoints halfway through the courses that I had to hit and I couldn‚Äôt hit them by going around. I hate that course with a burning passion.

For sure. Ton of clipboards there too.
---
On PS4 when dropping stuff, usually excess junk, there will often be a random non-junk item in there. Notes, armour, anything. I think I lost a few decent legendaries that way before I started checking every bag I drop afterwards. Is that the same thing that you mentioned? I don't see any shuffling, but it could be what's going on unseen
---
The logic behind the TSE nerf was to bring balance. If you agreed the TSE was too powerful because it was one shotting things the same logic would dictate you should then nerf melee that is one shotting things or buff everything else to match it.
---
The PA targeting HUDs work, although not always consistently, but usually. Also they seem to crash consoles (or just PS4?) regularly, but have little/no issue on PC.
---
I know its you Todd youre not fooling anyone
---
I long for a world where we can simply stop doing something without announcing it as if it's some huge deal.
---
My "DwellerProTip" is to pick up Technical Data from the bunker every time you sell there and drop it off between your Harper's Ferry and Watoga jump. It pays you 25 caps for doing that quest plus a chance at a rare drop. (Also allows for fulfilling those daily challenges for doing a quest with a hat on or intoxicated, etc.)
---
Money every time you want it you‚Äôre going have to take it

I just annotated your post dude, the fuck is over-sensitive?

The vault people are alive for feed the people. The quests aren't for you to help someone, they are for you to understand the past and experience someones story, and to get loot rewards.

I don‚Äôt think they exist, sadly.

Anyone who inflicts *enough* damage. I‚Äôm not sure the threshold but it seems to be 1-5%.
---
You should love it. Nothing wrong with loving it. I love a bunch of dumb stuff. Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it is objectively bad and did not deliver a worthy fallout experience. 
---
See this is his stupid you are. You just said something that is completely meaningless. 
---
You have no idea what kind of games I play. I certainly don‚Äôt buy games based on the company that makes them. Bethesda has lots of games I‚Äôm not interested in playing.
---
I‚Äôm not even praising Bethesda. I‚Äôm calling out people like you and your stupidity. You guys have your blind hate rage and you say stupid things. 
---
You think your clever making up things and then pretending they are facts.
---
You‚Äôre kind is so stupid, I‚Äôve literally said things like I‚Äôm purposely baiting you hand bashers and doing exactly the same kind of stuff you guys do.
---
And you keep falling for it and taking the bait,
---
You are do filled with your own hate and need to spread your anger, you can‚Äôt even realize it.
---
You are literally that stupid. You get told what is happening and you still can‚Äôt help yourself.
---
Thank you, have added this to the post!
---
This. Just keep them tagged for search from the first time you run out. You will be amazed by how much you find. 
---
I have tested that and I don't think that's the case. I have tried it with a mini gun and Gatling gun, as well as my normal weapons. The highest I have seen it go is 60 and that was after I crafted about 200 rounds of ammo for it. If I swap away from it and back it always has a different amount. 
---
because a competent developer would definitely have let the game get to this state
---
yup
---
I‚Äôll take a look with my Strange in numbered Marsupial + jet pack 
---
I'm always spawned in the toxic water that's right outside the build radius...it's pretty unfun.
---
They did add respec. It's just not done the quick and easy way many folks wanted.
---
I actually posted much the same 78 days ago and got a bunch of ‚Äúno durr, the point is they‚Äôre dead‚Äù responses. I floated the idea of an event where the SBQ is put down lifting the issue that killed the population and the groups return from Vaults, or just the edges of the map. 
---
All those dead raider bases get re-opened and the New Responders form to create a balance.
---
-
---
It‚Äôs either that or get heavy on the persistent environment so I can set up as a trader, and IRL people can become the NPCs. 
---
theres a subreddit called falloutraiders I believe, ask there
---
My thoughts are much the same but I dont understand why they just dont reach out to the fo4 modding community and see if they would be willing to let BGS use it, paying them a reasonable amount for it. Its be cheaper than making it all in house. So it's an easy, quick and inexpensive solution that add a lot to the game.
---
I have found that if you are there right when it starts and you go straight to the spot and kill off the super mutants (if any), then it works just fine. But if the mutants kill of the scorched first then it does seem to bug out. 
---
keep  trying kid i won this argument because you responded by being a  troll    hold your L i'll take my ez win. Its obvious youre projecting to     everyone reading because you suck at live you keep doing that salty kid   it fuels me that youre so mad that you cant respond to my post because      you'll look even more salty if you do and your peers will laugh at    you failing to troll and just projecting, kid

now since i dont  need your shit trolling enjoy the BLOCK

QoL mod that would make the game actually function how it‚Äôs supposed to.
---
Nah, it's just special perks you can get from becoming irradiated or by taking a serum (you can buy them from the Enclave, or get recipes from the SB Queen).
---
Good catch! I vaguely remember reading that from a note in a small shack whilst originally scouring the town for the masks. Possibly near the post office and containing some junked protectrons?
---
Nice joke comment dude

Upvoted for 10/10 Billy Mays roleplay

The bunker belongs to Greene Defense company or something. You can also find a terminal at a cabin near top of the world that belongs to this Greene guy or one of his associates. Seems they had an interest in aliens or cryptids and we‚Äôre bringing in an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù to look at something. Not sure where the trail leads next but the note at Freddy Fear‚Äôs near the door you open with the rusty key is interesting too. I want to believe all this pieces together somehow
---
That‚Äôs nice. Enjoy the steaming pile of shit. 
---
You mean the cranberry bog? I get that, especially in the blast zone.  Queenie tends to birth maybe 1 to 3 spawns so its not as bad as other places. She's just slower because of the number of people that will participate.  
---
This is more of a where able, be responsible, 'cause pete and todd dgaf.

It‚Äôs so easy but the only time I had trouble with it was during beta when it was s complete shit show. Have done it with 3 characters since got it first got every time, what builds are people using that they struggle?
---
I could have sworn that was fixed last patch, unless it was brought back if it was 2 patches ago

I critique a post, you critique a person. You don't even know my name. You think you have the moral high ground let alone know what a day of my life is like?
---
But it's not.... The developers expressly stated they didn't want to treat this as an mmo. The game is not designed around being an mmo, it's designed around being *multiplayer Fallout*. The only thing it has in common with mmos is multiplayer. If they wanted it to be an mmo they'd make it more like ESO. But it's closer to a single player game than it is to something like that. People bitching about "end game content" want this game to be something it's not.
---
Just take a power plant. In 4 hours i had about 25
---
Did you read the original post?  It‚Äôs obvious I‚Äôm not defending Bethesda, the whole point of the original post is that I am unwilling to wait and have lost confidence in Bethesda.
---
The comment above is stating a fact: 2 years to fix promises features in No Man‚Äôs Sky.  
---
There‚Äôs no scenario where I‚Äôll be playing this game a month from now unless drastic, extensive fixes are made and content is released.
---
no problem

I have yet to finished the quest. When I finish it I‚Äôd be happy to give you mine. GT is Xwolfpackleader 
---
And people complain about hoarders, but then they complain about not having enough stuff. I play fallout, I HOARD EVERYTHING and in doing so I always have what I need, when I need it.
---
The fact of the matter is, unless you work for BGS, know someone who works for BGS (who told you directly that loot boxes are coming), or have broken in to their computer systems and have absolute evidence, you are speculating.
---
Anyone who says they are coming without a doubt, is speculating.
---
Anyone who says that this game is going free to play is speculating.
---
So, if you want to speculate, by all means.  But if you speak like it is an absolute, without CONCRETE evidence (not speculation from datamined data that is unused), then I immediately tune you out as someone looking for ePeen points, a Troll, os a clickbait Youtuber looking to try and get views.
---
You really don't understand how video games work do you? The people that make the decisions to launch games are the people so far removed from the actual development of them I doubt they even have an idea what the game is about.  If BGS Austin says the game isn't ready but Zemimax says to launch it. The game gets launched. 
---
I am ashamed to admit I have used it on another player. Though in my defense, they were like level 200, had a Tse handmade, and was intentionally jumping in front of me while I was fighting to get me to start combat with them (I had passive mode on) and when that failed, switched to just flat out trying to murder me with slap damage.
---
I took a stim to heal up, turned passive off, vatsed his head and bitch slapped him into another server. 
---
Supper dupper 
---
I hate to be the one to tell you this, but there is a 90% chance this game is dead in the eyes of Bethesda. Dropping playerbase means there microtransaction shop is useless. With so many bugs to fix at this point they probably are going to slow support for the remainder of the year than put it on life support for another (this way they don't have to do any refunds).
---
It‚Äôs shit compared to what it was but I wouldn‚Äôt consider it weak.  
---
I punched a Scortchbeast with a death tambourine, it was enough. I have no perks in punching stuff

Sure. That's why my friends list has a maximum of 2 people online. Don't kid yourself.

8 cores in an hour is a lot, I'll have to do this.  
---
The shills and fanbois can only bully with downvotes the lone posters in the depths of "New" posts. But things have a funny way of balancing out. For every action there is sometimes an overwhelmingly unequal reaction.
---
This will be a drop-and-pick-up game. Play it till you get bored, set it aside, come back when something new happens. If you can only afford one game in, say, the next three months, don't make it this one, but if you're not hurting for cash, it IS a fun game to a certain point, and if there is one thing that ESO taught us, it's that BGS will polish a turd until you forget it ever was one.
---
This game is dead
---
That's what all the PC Users say ;)
---
But did you do the rest? Blowing out the INI's and letting them rebuild?
---
I think one shots are a problem but blaming it on melee is too simplistic. There are more to melee builds than that. For example, on my melee build it is unlikely that I‚Äôll one shot you. I do not (currently, heh) use the build that enables such hitting power.
---
So, what‚Äôs the problem? Buffs. And it isn‚Äôt something melee can use, it‚Äôs just that melee is easiest to use with it so it is most common. What buffs? Bloodied, Unyielding, Adrenal Reaction. But those are low HP! You exclaim. They are glass cannons! No, oh my no they are not. There are ways to stretch out that HP. With more buffs.
---
The issue you‚Äôre seeing is melee‚Äôs natural and I say necessary edges being leveraged with crazy buffs that *any* weapon could use. If any nerf is called for it is Bethesda to make a detailed, thoughtful and close examination of all the buffs that are stackable in this game. And hope they take the time to ensure every change they make doesn‚Äôt also make cause unintended collateral nerfs to things that didn‚Äôt need it.
---
TL;DR - You‚Äôre playing with fire asking Bethesda to open this can of worms. It‚Äôs ten times bigger than the TSE problem, and the end result of it won‚Äôt be pretty. Simplistic nerf calls are only gonna make things worse.
---
So, The Matrix Online?

---
Well my opinion is that the dev team for fallout76 is too small and not used with the codes, and before they have to add trivial stuff for the gameservice they provide they should better force their recources on finaly fixing gamebreaking bugs and glitches instead adding not hardly needed stuff like an survivalmode or more housing stuff, where we all have the basic stash to build the essencially needed workbenches, light and defense. Who need more quality of life stuff when people always bug in their powearmor or get a gamecrash, disconnect, serverlag, immortal enemys, unlootable nukezones, despawning dead enemys without an chance to get loot or any Other gamebreaking bugs? 
---
I just googled "fallout76" and got an article as Top result in my language where a big gaming magazine said the Game isnt going to get fixed anymore, the last patch which took 4 weeks added alot of old bugs and glitches, the Game is getting worse and worse and all i read is shit like more useless housing crap.
---
You‚Äôre nearing r/iamverysmart levels

You don't have to participate, which ones can you not avoid?
---
I fly in top of poles in Watoga and keep garbage out others peoples eyes and reach
---
I‚Äôm a solo player. I had the same issues regarding the SBQ. I‚Äôve never done the nuke myself, but have the levels and stuff to. I just don‚Äôt bother. I‚Äôve joined a few events, and after using all my stim packs, massive amounts of rad away and ammo, breaking my Gatling plasma ( so like 10 shots ) and another gun in the process, I end up getting some nonsense loot that I could‚Äôve gained by farming white springs. Then spend Hours farming and fixing weapons afterwards. 
---
If the SBQ is the final boss in this game, her loot table and every enemy in the area should drop some serious loot to make up for using every item in your fucking inventory on top of breaking all your shit. 
---
While we are talking about legendary loot, WTF is the point of the useless legendary weapons in this game no one wants or uses. Like, why bother programming in a ‚Äúlvl 50 2* beserkers rolling pin‚Äù that does more damage the lower your health. So great, instead of 50 damage it‚Äôll do 65. Whoopdie shit. I can just punch the damn thing and make more damage. 
---
Get 4. While I am enjoying 76, 4 is to me a unarguably better place to start with if you're not familiar with the setting. 3 is okay story wise, but the gameplay can be annoying if you're not on PC (auto-missing gunshots because your skills arbitrarily tell you as much is amazingly annoying in a FPS).
---
I agree you can be dissatisfied still. I just think directly comparing what you paid for it against others is a bad path to go down. In regards to seeing something stolen, that‚Äôs obviously different since it‚Äôs theft. 
---
 I love how your response to it being a lazy reply is to literally make the same exact insult. There goes your high horse 
---
now keep   trying kid i won this argument because you responded by being a  troll     hold your L i'll take my ez win. Its obvious youre projecting to      everyone reading because you suck at live you keep doing that salty kid    it fuels me that youre so mad that you cant respond to my post  because      you'll look even more salty if you do and your peers will  laugh at    you failing to troll and just projecting, kid
---
Melee doesn't "casually" hit for 10k. That takes a lot of setting up and stacking perks and buffs and situations to get anywhere near that number.
---
Bruh everyone on this sub has complained about how shitty the holotape quest lines are... Good voice acting? Is that a joke? You think that the terribly boring quests that seemingly have no meaning behind them aside from ‚Äúfind out why this person died‚Äù are what people are enjoying most about this game? Are you sure you‚Äôre reading the same sub I am?
---
Again, not everyone is you and your friends! Stop speaking and casting your experience onto other people. Can you explain how you are telling people what aspect of the game they‚Äôre going to get their enjoyment out of??? AND on top of that, you‚Äôre telling them how many hours enjoyment their gonna get from it? Makes zero fucking sense lol i swear to god I truly question the thought process you in this sub. Think before you write something so stupid 
---
They do. I got them a long time ago from a req drop.
---
Or you found a sever with a lot of stealth builds. I've done that before, was shocked as hell when I finally saw someone.Only time I ever found an empty server was at 6am est on a weekday, and started filling up a few minutes later.
---
Ok 
---
Poopy
---
Oh for real? Looks like I just have to keep looking for technical data then... Any tips on how to get the paint other than farming data from the enclave? 
---
You do it in their memory.  You do it for the rewards.  You do it to begin rebuilding Appalachia.
---
Then what happens when you put 600/600 and remove your perks?
---
Or at least vertical half walls
---
Something that would allow for people to compete a difficult event in a town, i.e. Flatwoods, and then be able to take over the town like a workbench.  You'd have the "defend" events for the town.  Limit players to claiming only one building but it'd be tied to the player like their camp.  If someone has that building claimed on whatever server you join later you can hop to another.
---
Because there‚Äôre no people left to do the initiations.

The game is in a technical point of view very glitchy broken in certain aspect but beautiful and fun at times 
---
pm me, if you still need dense
---
Yep :/
---
You can also find the vendor not as one of the random encounters between the Charleston Fire Station and Riverside Manor. Seen it there twice, only had something worth buying there once.
---
I‚Äôve also found it on the tracks heading from the Forest to Grafton Station.
---
If you move in a circle around it while shooting, it won't be able to hit you with the missiles

i throwing away at least 4/5 core everyday took too much weight have at least 10 each time

I'll tell you why theres no transparency. It's because all these fuck ups are probably the result of idiots in upper management at Zenimax. They are probably pencil pushers with no understanding of games, gamers, or hardware. It would explain the bad servers. One of them probably thought they could run it like a mobile game like Fallout Shelter and use servers made for cheap mobile games. This person or group of people are probably the types that cant stand being wrong on anything. Despite the constant problems they are delusional enough to believe that their way will fix everything despite experts around them telling them otherwise. There is little to no transparency because these idiots and their bad leadership would be exposed to the world. Hell, they probably blame people who advised against these moves for making these moves. What's needed is for whoever the idiots who pushed for these bad decisions to be exposed and demoted or fired. New leadership is needed at Zenimax and parts of Bethesda, as they have more than proven they are not capable of leading the company in the right direction. 
---
Mate, I got some bad news. You screwed up. Even 5 minutes of research, one google search and one review website (even sodding Kotaku or Forbes) would have warned you about all but #3. I highly suggest in the future that you spend those 5 minutes next time.
---
True, that too. 
---
It's just a revolver on those damn Gutsy?!  Oh FFS...  All I knew was it sounded like an air soft, but hit me harder than my .50 cal sniper rifle hits a lvl 1 Radroach.
---
And yet it has all the hall marks of an MMO. There are multiple ways to deal with an MMO and making it a copy of existing MMO games like ESO is only one way. Destiny is an MMO as is GTA Online and there are a lot of similarities between them.
---
NPCs repopulate with responders and raiders and Bos. Also the horny teen mods where everything is a hot anime chick with a massive rack.
---
Are you constantly in PA?
---
Stash explode all overage and it's a free for all of your stash stuff.
---
Oh man I didn't know 
---
THEY SUBVERTED MY EXPECTATIONS 
---
Then you can't add any more to your stash box. Is that such a terrible thing?
---
I have updated the post in light of your suggestion, but have included a small [caveat](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al3yla/bug_my_red_x01_headlamp_has_changed_into_a/).
---
The fact that Hunter/Hunter is in game, but this kind of shit is still present to players who clearly aren't interested, is what pisses me off.
---
ah I been having this happen to me too! I'm not a PA user but I do carry around my Excavator set I made from the quest just to hop in sometimes while I'm on vendor trade runs. And I've had the left leg "fall off" all the time and kept getting so confused what was going on.
---
Go capture the big excavator in the ash heap. Tons of.ore and a fun event for 30 minutes.
---
Melee could always be stronger then TSE based on certain conditions and now it is one of the strongest builds. Stealth builds and such can make baliistics stronger, but guns are inherently weaker to melee and far less rewarding. One has you constantly scrounging for lead and ammo, one just makes it so you have to repair. In both scenarios, you need to repair either way. In the other, there's less stress and less maintenance. It's inherently at an advantage already due to that fact.
---
It's the only weapon that scales due to a SPECIAL stat, which makes inherently stronger then ballistics. It has special effects from legendaries that scale relatively stronger comparatively to gun legendaries.
---
It absolutely should be balanced. But the issue is, a lot of guns (aside from stealth builds) are just weaker. Lasers? Two-handed? Even certain classes of rifle. Automatic rifles, to a point. It's just pathetic how big the difference is. 
---
Exactly,  not a big deal.
---
I'd love to see that if you'd be willing to screenshot it!  Not that I don't believe you, I *absolutely* do, I just want some real proof that I'm not actually crazy thinking that it was in the BETA :D
---
I think that's for atom shop paints only not 
---
in game paints like the bother hood paint.
---
Getting same today.  Every time I load in, about 10 seconds later it freezes.  The current song will continue to play, and ambient noise will continue, but it's graphically frozen.
---
The way to fix the system is to stop rewarding bad game design with each log on.
---
As far as I know it‚Äôs just a reward for putting the data on the camp , but I‚Äôve been reading that since patch 5 it hardly ( if it even drops anymore )
---
If you got the flux I can do for u 
---
90% of your stash is likely junk. Pack right would make your effective weight much higher than whatever they would give us as a static jncrease.
---
Seems more reasonable for Bethesda to simply remove those items from the game after X minutes of inactivity...
---
So say I kill a ghoul and nothing is ‚Äòworth it‚Äô so I walk away. Few minutes later it becomes a meat pile and will disappear in 5 minutes.
---
3 minutes into THAT timer you search the pile and pick something or nothing up. Timer resets to 5 minutes because it was interacted with.
---
That ought to allow for enough ‚Äòbut mah LOOTS!‚Äô and let the servers spend more time doing things ‚Äòright‚Äô
---
Agreed and you have my sympathies. My post contains A LOT of the misspelled word as well, must have made your eyes bleed!
---
Okay I'm sorry I swore 
---
INVERTED ROOF CORNERS FFS PLEASE BETHESDA, EVEN SHITTY CAPCOM GOT IT RIGHT WITH CONAN EXILES
---
For the invisible enemies bug, the best way to kill them is to use melee weapons. You swing it around you a lot and once you gain some exp, that means that the invisible enemy is dead. If you're still losing HP then repeat those steps untill you don't lose HP anymore.
---
I miss my Concrete stairs from 4.
---
Or just dont allow removal of those perks if it would overcap your stash, forcing you to clean it up before you card swap.
---
The guy was an idiot in game. I made a comment similarly phrased. I lost some imaginary internet points. It‚Äôs all gravy, dude. 
---
No it hasn‚Äôt.
---
  +karma
---
I'd rather not have those piles sitting on the server. These servers can't handle much.
---
I'm still positive about the game, but i got bored from the shitshow that came after TSE nerfs. 
---
Assuming that one dude's got the stomach for an unofficial patch, that one.
---
Really though, I want the damn console back. I lost count of the number of times I've needed to tcl my way out of something because I'm stuck somewhere I can't back out of. If I could re-spawn items that vanish or get accidentally scrapped, so much the better.
---
Green thumb
---
I think the Death Blossoms quest has the same quirk that Feed the People at Mama Dolce's originally had, where its reward is randomly given to everyone on the server.
---
Oh, man, they still didn't fix this? Maybe my memory is blasted, but I thought we could do this in the BETA and then it didn't work upon release.
---
Regardless, I stopped playing FO76 when I ran out of quests and realized that PVP isn't really a thing. I'll be back next expansion! Hoping some of these issues are resolved by then though :)
---
Turns out 76 is actually a prequel game to Fallout 5. In FO5, you wake up from the VR vault experiment AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN. but of course all the changes we want are implemented then. 
---
Disconnects are my biggest gripe for this reason. 
---
Try to make sure you are only building things when the resource counts are green so it uses workshop resources instead of your own.
---
Usually all I have to invest is a bit of nuclear material for the generator.
---
There are citations you can check out on Bethesda Studios Austin Wikipedia page - insert thumbs up emote -
---
I‚Äôd like to point every one to this video: https://youtu.be/8KF87WolTRc
---
I believe that is the right one. While not everything said is necessarily true/believable, he does go over good information concerning which branch has been overseeing FO76‚Äôs development and the people who are working there.
---
Sorry if that‚Äôs the wrong video, it was lost in my history and don‚Äôt currently have the time to watch it and make sure it‚Äôs the right one.
---
Maybe tag as spoiler? I hadn't seen what mothman looked like before now and I was trying to wait until I encountered him in game :/ I thought this post was an actual warning about griefers.
---
You can sort by "condition" in your aid tab which shows the "condition" of perishables i.e., time until they spoil. The function you speak of is already in-game. (PS4 player)
---
Yeah, you can make food from it. 
---
Wow really? 
---
I need to do more research. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs worth it for these negative offsets to fully max out that perk.
---
Fair enough, I was drawing the conclusion that the effects given from weekly event were from the lunch boxes and that is speculation. Pete Hines said there wouldn‚Äôt be loot boxes or pay to win in the game too so I‚Äôm kinda going off that too 
---
Sorry man I don't even have enough flux to make me a jetpack, if you've got at least 2 cobalt flux and a couple violet I could do it though
---
I might need a better description. It‚Äôs not the building with the space helmet and telescope on it is it? I‚Äôm pretty sure you can get on that one with a vanilla character.
---
What ya on bro ?

399 hours in. Some Beta time. 
---
I thought that also. With the amount of just audio and sparse terminal info dumps and messages, they should maybe have made a Choose Your Own Adventure novel or radio drama instead. Those two genres are really trending again lately.
---
It should be common sense you‚Äôre not helping the previous residents of Appalachia, you‚Äôre helping your fellow residents of 76
---
You make radaway 
---
Im dropping the game, not getting rid of it, and picking up No mans sky with friends:) 
---
I got lots of tomahawks but no plans. If they really come from req drops..
---
 I may have to (slowly) use all these requisitions I have stored up. 
---
I can guess that this feature was removed because of the way loading world is designed. Your camp (or other camps) will start loading when you're near it. It would cause problems if let's say you put your mat on an elevation of your camp and you'd be loaded in before the camp was. They'd need to refactor the way they designed dynamic loading in the game. Again this is just a guess and certainly does not excuse the sloppy loading to memory design. 
---
Seems like this game gets the same treatment as other Beth games. At first they push it out, then the usual bugfixes that bring more bugs, then we see some more medium patches, that actually fix some stuff. After that we get only shop updates with no fixes to serious bugs.
---
After a quite long time we get DLCs. New content with more bugs... And don't forget the shop updates.
---
They care more about the shop then the game.
---
This is really pathetic Bethesda. You are pathetic. 
---
I can relate to that, having this happened to me before. But it should never have gone past the packaging stage, I guess their workflow is broken. 
---
Also water filters 
---
I went from grinding hours for materials to one shoting everything for 2 to 3 hours a day after the patch i went to about 1 to 3 hours a week
---
I'm looking for the power armor paint
---
Add me Kiwiryan just pay me what caps ya can, hows that sound
---
This. Exactly how I felt about the stories/quests. Like a detective in murder cases, when you show up, it means the people you‚Äôre going to help find justice for are already dead. But that doesn‚Äôt mean your work is meaningless or the dead people‚Äôs stories are worth knowing. The world of Fallout IS depressing, like any place in a war zone.
---
Give more info
---
Not sure you understand the word troll.
---
Level 160 feels like 500000 hours and loving it
---
I hear you, it‚Äôs just that your anecdote is meaningless. Level 50 scorchbeast? 80? How many times did you punch it? What was your listed damage?
---
I tried farming (leeching) Whitesprings during a nuke with my level 20. My 10mm pistol would not get me credit unless I dumped the whole magazine on a single ghoul. My Somerset Special and Sniper rifle both pretty reliably gave me credit. I‚Äôve also seen it with big beasts where I only manage to tag them with 1 bullet from an automatic before they go down..
---
 No credit. 
---
Fully close the launcher and try again. Happened to me before and that fixed it
---
I tested this alot today and it does not increase damage. It shows on your stats that it does but a level 68 super mutant still takes the same amount of bullets to kill with my  AAE handmade claiming 1560 dps. I really wished it did work.
---
&gt;  My game runs in Widows
---
Those poor widows.
---
THINK OF THE WIDOWS!
---
I don‚Äôt know anything like that. I‚Äôm sorry
---
There was a mod that did this in FO4
---
Technically.. You actually aren't supposed to know they're dead yet. I believe full immersion is key to enjoyment, even if that is admittedly difficult. But oh well. 
---
Fallout 76 is perhaps the only multiplayer loot game where 90% of the legendaries are completely worthless.
---
Thanks, Legendary Glowing One, for my Nocturnal Cane. Now when I swing this cane at night, I'll be able to do almost half as much damage as a level appropriate melee weapon!
---
666
---
Your all welcome...
---
 I want sim settlements for FO76, start rebuilding Appalachia.   
---
Lvl 379 and almost 500 hours. And yes i have a full time job to any haters.‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Sounds good to me, just so you know though I only have like 200 since the jet pack plans ran me almost 6k
---
They nerfed things like white knight because the game needs a certain amount of grind and time sink.
---
They want you to play more, so things that would be more fun, or more useful, cant be too useful vs the time required to use them.
---
So, white knight making things cheaper, means less time playing to grab those materials. So they had to nerf it to what they think they can get away with.
---
As long as there are no enemies attacking you you should be able to re-fast travel back to the camp. as long as you don't encounter the fast travel bug which occasionally prevent you from fast traveling to your camp. 
---
Nope. It would cause problems when you take the perk off.
---
There is a real honest to god solution to this though.
---
Wait till they raise it. They said they will. You just have to wait.
---
No. The issue is you would be well over 600 in your stash.  So it would be exploitable.  
---
Locking your perks to stash access would be any annoying addition.  Oh, sorry, cannot remove your Pack Rat cause it would put your stash which you don‚Äôt have access to up to 601 lbs.  
---
I will take a look at it.
---
When I say next or actually impossible I mean just that. IE If I have hemlock holes, no one else is getting it until the server resets. It is literally impossible to take after I get to it. With others it would require another player to get a bounty before getting a chance to TRY to start claiming it, meaning  I could kill them before they even got to the workshop. I‚Äôve held of full groups by myself multiple times, even when out geared and leveled. It could be fun if a way was found to balance it, but so far I can‚Äôt think of a way to do so and most of my 399 hours playing have been just workshopping. 
---
Believe me. I want this idea to work. I just don‚Äôt think it will. 
---
Stash needs to bump to 1,000
---
I never believed the rumors only because the documentary established that microtransactions would remain cosmetic only.  If they break on that promise, there will be hell to play all over again, but I'm aware things could change and they might very well go back on it, just really hoping they don't for the sake of the game and their integrity. 
---
If we do get lunchboxes, I figure if anything they'd probably be event rewards, or rare loot that serves a similar function to what they are in Fallout 4.  I notice a distinct lack of bottlecap mines in 76, lunchboxes would be good to add for old times sakes.
---
Find a CAMP. You can find them by looking at little white dots on the map loitering around the same area in the middle of nowhere for a while. If you find one with no one home destroy a turret or something to get their attention. Demand food, water, ammo, chems, etc. or you will destroy more. Or find an owned Workshop. Do the same thing. If they refuse to hand over the goods it's time for wrecking ball/PvP.
---
And the shitty things aren't bugs, they're features.
---
Does it look complete to you? Or are they still working on it? 
---
Demolitions and the one that gives you your throwing arc. I‚Äôm my groups demo guy.
---
Also do as many breach and clear missions as you can (I believe it requires completing mother lode)
---
No, that isn't it. Survival games are supposed to be challenging, not remove all opportunity to play and introduce things scaled beyond the content you're working on 
---
Just to deliver an electric bill thats 25 year overdue
---
I have the second man mask. I dont remember where I found it. I did not know it was anything special 
---
If you say so, bud.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Yeah I wish this was part of the hot fix the did 
---
Also if it IS that one....There‚Äôs something there, but you aren‚Äôt going to get closure ;)
---
Yea but Fallout and The Outer Worlds is a different beast. Outer World is not open world, not truly persistent, nor has the need for engine work (Unreal 4 Vs. Creation).
---
The major reason why Bethesda games are so buggy is because of True Persistence and open world to the scale that it is.
---
ITS GATLING TIME 
---
Who cares if your stash is at 1000/600? You can't add any more? You're stuck at some limit that your cards allow.
---
Don't know how much to tell you, but the layout was certainly complete. Containers were lootable, terminals were up and running (photo evidence). There was only one door we couldn't access. No reason given such as [Inaccessible]. Wasn't a major door, either. Not like Morgantown's University vault where the door to maintenance isn't accessible.
---
Also no Vault 63 jumpsuit. I was sad about that. We have our theories about what the Devs are planning but I think I've shared enough information to risk a ban lmao.
---
I do say so. A game that continues to play after you finish the main story. You have to continually up keep your gear rather then just get it once and never have to bother with it again.  Purposefully creating events and activities that are best done with a group of players to share in the difficulty and speed up the reward and reduce costs of it.   
---
If it was just a fallout game with multiplayer it wouldn't have any of those. 
---
Frankly, before they do anything to make getting the right weapon easier, they NEED to fix the fact that weapons are the only thing that matters gearwise. 
---
Since PA doesn't get legendarys, PA mods are sold on vendors and Normal Armor can't be worn with PA, there is zero reason to farm anything BUT a weapon. That means one lucky drop, and you're done. All the game will have left for you is to go farm Caps to buy recipes and mods.
---
They need to either add PA Legendary drops, or my preference, make Armor wearable under PA. Or take the mods off Vendors and put them on the queen. Something! Maybe add a couple trinket slots so they can add those to the tables too.
---
Yeah well most people are done waiting. And I'm just waiting for the Division 2 to release.
---
That was my thinking as well. 
---
They need to just allow private servers so modders can fix it like all the previous games
---
loot boxes didn't "turn out to be bullshit", they are literally still in the code and could be released any time...  as to F2P that was speculation w/o evidence, and yeah, I do want NPCs, they don't even have to be human, they can be ghoul or robot, why are there so few good non human NPCs?  as to Inside The Vault, I personally have no issue there, they didn't even need to add developer notes for all I care, most companies don't, and I do see they are attempting to patch the game, the patches for the most part have helped but it's still an unstable mess lacking in content, I would say the state it's in now is *barely* a $60 full retail release.  had they called the last 3 months a BETA or just launched the game in the state it's in now the backlash wouldn't have been nearly as bad...
---
I feel they should have at least left demolition expert alone
---
Trolling can just be general "messing" with someone. It doesn't *have* to be malicious. Indeed most decent trolling is done completely without malice. When done with malice, it goes fro "trolling" to "being a dick". 
---
My base is close to white springs and Watoga , so I fast travel to vault 76 ( it‚Äôs free !)
---
Hit flat woods run to Sutton fast travel back to base , spend 7 caps to travel to whitesprings hit the train station vendor pick a mini nuke Along the way go to the service entrance of the enclave bunker then back to base and literally jump the cliffs ( or jet pack ) to Watoga sell on those two vendors and then last harpers ferry , sometimes I like to take over berkeley springs just so I won‚Äôt have to run to harpers and instead travel to my workshop for free , all of this under maybe 20 minutes 
---
Because someone sold it to that bot. Common sense lol
---
I have no doubt they were planning the unreleased holiday stuff for this past holiday, but it is an ongoing online game, most last at least a few years, the holiday stuff may yet come this year...
---
So if it doesn‚Äôt matter if you are at 1000/600, why the convoluted process of tying it to perk cards instead of just making it 1000 limit straight up?
---
Weight reduction on the items doesn‚Äôt magically make it less ‚Äústressful‚Äù on the servers or what ever reason Bethesda claims.
---
Some system of allowing weight reduction perks with limited ability to change perk cards based on stash limits is not a real solution to stash limits.  
---
Definitely save your money and don‚Äôt buy it.  It‚Äôs still so broken, and looks/feels like it was a rushed game.  
---
*Have had it since the Beta.*
---
That was the first thing I did and the game is set to run on the discrete card. The game runs fine if I set the desktop resolution to 640x480 and run the game in borderless window at 640x400. Judging from the crash, it appears the engine bugs out when it has to change the resolution at startup. All full-screen borderless resolutions, including full hd, now crashes the game for me. It may be a badly implemented hybrid graphics detection routine that when targeting full screen, it asks for the integrated card and completely ignores the radeon settings.
---
As I said in another comment:
---
&gt;...dont allow removal of those perks if it would overcap your stash, forcing you to clean it up before you card swap.
---
 It's been over 10 Days RIP bethesda.

---
Yeah when I was actively taking shops I ended up with hundreds of it (I wear PA).
---
It's been almost over 3 months, what is the general length of time before it's not a spoiler? (Serious here where is the line, cause don't get me wrong the title was a little misleading, but I can see their intent was coming from)
---
You said you've blocked me twice now. You gonna do it already?
---
but...  the lunchboxes even have animations and confetti?  I have no doubt plans changed but I guarantee they intended to release the lunchboxes similar to the way they implemented them in FO Shelter...  and there is still the possibility they do release them, but without any gameplay effects
---
Doesn't seem worth it when you never know when it's going to happen. But it always does.
---
 No please no nothing? Just a demand. I am inclined to just say no, but you probably just have no manners.
---
 The Sword has its own AP. The 3 levels of Incisor add to it, to the point it basically ignores all armor.
---
I kind of feel like I answered your question tbh, but maybe it means separating out locations.
---
I agree with you that at this point in time there is no indication to us as players that any humans are left alive in the West Virginia area except for other Vault 76 members.
---
However, and perhaps this is where we diverge, on a national or global level your character does have information that there are other survivors.  First being that there are other vaults still across the nation.  This was common knowledge before the bombs fell, while no doubt some of those faults would end in disaster some would not.  (Unless your character is a big pessimist which is an okay route to go in RP)
---
The other part about the Brotherhood of Steel is important because it at least highlights that people survived the bombs dropping.  California was in contact with West Virginia up till a few years before we get out of fallout 76.  According to the logs the only reason they stopped talking was because the satellite decayed in orbit not because the California chapter was destroyed.  (It‚Äôs also implied that the California chapter was talking with other survivors across the US)
---
You‚Äôre right when you say they is no definitive proof that California survived after the destruction of the satellite but there is also no proof that it didn‚Äôt.
---
In this way I think the world of fallout 76 presents a situation where it may be too late for the West Virginia area but it‚Äôs not too late for the rest of the world.  Destroying the scorched threat would allow struggling survivors elsewhere to not have to deal with that problem.  (Which is great becaus then fall out 1 through 4 would never happen)
---
But I agree with you that it‚Äôs possible a 76 dweller would either not care, or be too pessimistic to think they could do anything to change the world on a personal level.
---
Either I'm carrying it about with me all the time, which I think is probably worse on the servers, or it's in my stash where it's not even having any interaction with the server 99% of the time.
---
Everyone is making jokes, but it's actually referenced and acknowledged as weird.
---
In the NW corner of the map you'll find a small overhanging building by a ledge. It has a bunch of jars for collecting bioluminescent fluid from the fireflies.
---
There's a note there from a birdwatcher who specifically mentions that for some reason all of the birds are gone. Maybe it'll be relevant in the future? Perhaps the big bad stewing in the Mire scared off the more fragile and tuned in species? Who knows.
---
Lame they're not in, but interesting that it's directly referenced in game as odd.
---
LOVE this story!! 
---
You'll have to use something like 20 of your own aluminum and nuclear material, but otherwise yes.
---
Do you rely on the sneak for your survival or do you have power armour and stuff?
---
which you get at the sight 
---
yeah, but there's a lot of evidence to suggest they were planned to be released.  plus they are literally still in the code, they may yet release.
---
Then this type of game is not for you. Not every game needs to tell a definitive hero's journey arc, wherein you are the chosen one of destiny here to save the world. Sometimes, the game just gives you a canvas upon which to paint your own picture. 
---
I'll note that almost every single MMO has the same angle; even if you're the "chosen one" nothing you do truly changes the world. And FO76 is more in the style of an MMO than a single player RPG.
---
I would want a baby deathclaw that follows me around regardless of a buff. 
---
If follower pets get introduced, I bet we will get lame in game critters as free pets, and all the cool ones will be in the Atom Shop for 800+ a pop.
---
I like this.. but to make it a bit more interesting, and give us more to farm, there should be 3 different items. One to unlock 1Star Abilitys, one to unlock 2star abilities, etc. You can only use a 2star if the weapon already has 1star, You can only use a 3star if the weapon has 2.
---
Make it so you can keep overwriting bad legendary effects by using another one.  It'd give a bit of progression as you farm the mods to keep rerolling your main weapon untill it's perfect.
---
If they really wanna push the progression angle, they could increase the effects of an ability the more times you've rerolled it. It'd also give you an interesting choice... do you keep your Two-Shot bonus you like.. or do you keep rerolling to get the upgrade?
---
And yet if you're a part of the team you have to complete quest objectives separately, don't get XP from enemies your team kills. There's no player hub anywhere to speak of on the map. The faction system is barely existent and not player focused at all. PvP is a shoehorned mess and the only "raid" event is the final boss. Player bases can't even be combined.
---
Team focused events =/= mmo. (and name some that *actually* require a team) But please tell me more about how this game "has all the hallmarks of an mmo" you fucking muppet.
---
I was picturing actual skeletons.
---
What content expansion. Nothings been announced other than a PVP mode and some vague words about new vaults 
---
No this bunker belongs to the government it says in the terminal that had a list of the bunkers 
---
All good bro I‚Äôll pop on bit later
---
Yawn.
---
Nope, I never use it.
---
I have a stock pile. Every few days a group of friends and I take a power plant, do the ‚Äústarting up X power plant‚Äù event, and hold onto it most of the night and make cores that way. 
---
Any item that applies custom paint can‚Äôt be dropped this included ( I have nuka paint can‚Äôt drop )
---
THAT's what it was, yes. I couldn't recall.
---
I made a post threatening Bethesdas incomplete game at full price with legal action. Apparently a lot of legal teams have already tried.
---
(But how many from Australia? We have very tough consumer laws here compared to the USA - I'm working on it).
---
If what you say is true op, this game is truely a disaster. If the sales are lower than any previous game, thats sad but a strong reflection on the effort made before releasing the game.
---
I think that it should be regarded as sunk and compensation should find its way to the consumer. If they ever find they have to close their servers: we the consumers will have smooth grounds to file a class action lawsuit for being sold an unusable item on a large scale.
---
Either way, hiring more people ASAP to make the game reasonably substantial for the cost, will be the cheapest way to repair their game and hold on to the community that remains, possibly seeing the return of some.
---
Or they can keep the low budget post-game like they are clearly doing, keep pissing everyone off even more while still paying wages and server costs with no rectifying result!
---
Bethesda if I get any voice in this:
---
You've been doing cheap this whole time, how about spending some money to make some money... or even just to keep you away from a major consumer class action, or a total product recall?
---
I would love to see a court order Bethesda to produce what they were paid for.
---
Sweet will give it a go
---
It's mostly a week. The spoiler tag shouldn't be needed. 
---
Which means having stash limits affected by perk cards is unnecessary and they need to just straight up raise the limit.  
---
Lucky!!!
---
A melee build can be complex. Allot of perk cards involved/armor/ chems/ bobbleheads/ alcohols/ under armour/ mutations etc. 
---
I'd say honor they're efforts
---
That happens when you use the filter category I‚Äôve noticed 
---
Why are you still in this sub? The bigger loser isn't the person playing a game you don't like; it's the person frequenting the sub of a game they don't even play.
---
 lmao thanks for pointing out the obvious. That was the fucking point 
---
Why when you could manage it using perk cards to fit even more than any proposed increase? So what if it overflows. The downside is you can't add another item. Some people might just fill their stash with junk. Others might have armor and weapons. They get to choose how they manage their stash with weight reduction.
---
Now it is barely worth taking. You'll expend more trying to fend off the 3 scorch beasts at a time defense events than you gain from it.
---
To what, in your opinion?
---
You're fine. His request was ridiculous.
---
I do think they should‚Äôve never revealed there are no living NPCs. The ongoing hope of finding someone alive would‚Äôve been neat (even though game archaeologists would‚Äôve found out in the code.)
---
I do believe we are kinda doing quests for each other in essence. Like the Feed the People event gives you boxed/preserved food for you (and presumably your team).
---
And I would argue 99% of us thought this is how it worked when we first started playing.
---
Hi, I have passed your suggestions on to the team to promptly ignore 
---
And allow underarmor to remain equipped. 
---
????
---
Are you ok?
---
Yes, but he wants the ones that will spoil soonest starting at the top, rather than the bottom, so we don't have to scroll down everytime. Makes good sense. 
---
im just actually surprised no reports on epileptic seizures reported from it..
---
lol, way to shut OP the fuck up with one post. 
---
Had to smash that upvote button. This is the type of in game experience I love to hear about with other players.
---
PS4. Level 65. My challenges says over 300 hours but for a while my brother and sister-in-law had their own characters on my account (we shared a PS4 for a while) so I have no idea how many hours I‚Äôve played... though 300 doesn‚Äôt sound far off. üòµ
---
I made a complete set of excavator armour and that chewed through my cores at an alarming rate! That was with the max level perk card too.
---
Until the Bethesda Fun Police find out and they nerf it.
---
THANK YOU. just because like 1/3 of the community consists of PC losers who don‚Äôt want to interact with ppl outside of their small ass circle of gamer friends does NOT speak for the community as a whole. There are plenty of people exploring out there and I too have made over a dozen friends out in Appalachia. 
---
 Yeah my little lead patch has been dry for an unusually long time.
---
This guy avoids damage. 
---
Upboat for taking everyone to school. 
---
Well you have to be in the very centre of the blast (indicated by a compass icon that appears) and be killed by it -- if you mean can you launch the nuke right on top of you and just stay there, then no, because you are underground in the silo and the nuke won't kill you.
---
lol why are you still commenting then you twat?
---
Sneak
---
Like how often are you repairing? I play about 2 hours a night and haven't repaired my x01 in about 2 weeks. And when I do I equip 2 perk to improve durability and reduce mat cost. 16 springs per leg, I get a minimum 18 on my vendor run from static yaugai corpses. 
---
The game has plenty of annoyances but repairing power armour isn't one for me, I even gave up using power patches, didn't need 60% reduced wear and tear over other perks
---
For real. It‚Äôs especially frustrating considering this is a very recent bug too. It didn‚Äôt always do this until the last patch, I think. 
---
lmao this isn't a front page post you liar. 
---
Just admit you're still lurking here just to post salty comments. It'll be better for your soul. 
---
Why would you want to have to juggle perk cards to access your stash and/or juggle your stash to access your perk cards?  That just adds a complete headache.
---
And if you didn't have to keep the perk card in place, then it seems kind of pointless to tie it to the perk card.
---
Either way, doing it effectively increases the stash limit for everyone, which means that they could instead just increase the limit.
---
Same, I know there's a lot of in game issues but repairs and materials? Don't get it, have loads
---
When you first took a weight reduction card, were you not surprised when you realized it wasn't applying to you stash limit?
---
My friends and I sure were.
---
Phhffttt Vault 63 is for amateurs, get in Vault 420 then we‚Äôll talk
---
lol yeah I don't get this. It's like people do nothing but run around shooting stuff until their guns and armor break and then complain on reddit that their guns and armor are breaking. 
---
Buy it. Savour the main quest, immerse yourself in the story, explore the wasteland, and have fun.
---
I'm playing 2-4 hours a day. Have been since November. It's ridiculous addictive
---
And pencils and globes and paint. And a very good source for concrete!
---
They use Amazon servers which should be pretty good as Fortnite also uses them and they can handle 60-100 players without a problem. It is probably Bethesda‚Äôs fault.
---
 I have an Instigating one. I use it all the time and its just right. ;)
---
For what? After a couple of nukes post recipes patch I have far more than I can use
---
Never once had White Knight, have also never run out of ballistic fiber. If I run out of screws it's because I've made 20-25+ guns or pieces of armor at once and burned through my entire stock on purpose. What is the problem here?
---
Also disease cures
---
Bruh people on both sides of this sub have mutually complained about how shitty the holotape quest lines are... ‚ÄúReally good‚Äù voice acting? Is that a joke? You think that the terribly boring quests that seemingly have no meaning behind them aside from ‚Äúfind out why this person died‚Äù are what people are enjoying most about this game? Are you sure you‚Äôre reading the same sub I am?
---
Again, not everyone is you and your friends! Stop speaking and casting your experience onto other people. Can you explain how you are telling people what aspect of the game they‚Äôre going to get their enjoyment out of??? AND on top of that, you‚Äôre telling them how many hours enjoyment their gonna get from it? Makes zero fucking sense lol i swear to god I truly question the thought process you in this sub. Think before you write something so stupid, and the game is nothing like fallout 4, maybe if you played more than 15 hours you‚Äôd fucking see that.
---
IIRC some of the lunchbox animations are still unused suggesting a future or scrapped update. Some people speculated that Bethesda planned to add them as a form of microtransactions but with all the negative reputation decided to hold off for a while because they wouldn‚Äôt be well received at all, which is quite plausible.
---
In the end it doesn't matter what the limit is, as long as it exists, it will be reached and will be an annoyance.  400, 600, 1000, 2000, 10,000.
---
Higher limits will just mean we can store our weapon / armor options.  Hitting the limit faster.
---
As long as the limit exists, it will be too low.  Joys of a series of games which focused on collecting and hording being moved to an online system where a server has to store and search a database for every player.
---
I think a lot of people are passed frustrated at this point. Don't get me wrong, I love this game I do. The West Virginian landscape is awesome, the camps I run across creative, and the cryptids add a new aspect to the game, not to mention the stories. But that being said this game was pushed too fast. The enemies are too bullet spongy for weapons that 
---
A. do too little damage.
---
B. Break to quickly.
---
I hope Bethesda doesn't give up this can work.
---
I actually didnt know this. Thanks for the heads up.
---
We will eventually get some content, i think devs have focused more on polishing and bug fixing the game first though. But i hope it will come.
---
Go play ESO. Its built in.
---
This.   lol 
---
It's baffling. 
---
I really think there's a lot of Call of Duty players on the sub that are really bewildered at the whole farming thing or how it's a staple in literally every MMO ever.
---
If the game didn't suck dick maybe the sub wouldn't be so negative. Also, what positive points? 
---
Level 193 about 380 hours
---
Ok.  I‚Äôm really confused why people are taming mobs. Please help me 
---
No I don't want it forcing you to keep the perk card equipped. I never mentioned that. The stash limit could be increased even more by allowing overflow when you unequip the perk card. I already have to juggle carry weight perks cards almost every time I enter and exit my power armor to fast travel. I'm carrying around almost everything, armor, weapons, chems, etc. Everything except for clothing items a few sets of PA and junk. That is causing much more strain on the server every time I log in and do any interaction with my inventory than if all of that was "overflowed" in my stash.
---
They could also make every weapon do 1000 damage flat.
---
Rewarding perk decisions and specific build is a positive in my opinion. Look at Sturdy Frame, a pretty useless perk unless you are a stealth build,  but much more viable if it applied to your stash.
---
I would... but there's too much toxic air in there and I hate having to use a gas mask.
---
So you haven't actually played any survival games have you?  
---
Let me tell you a few experiences on Ark Survival Evolved.  After spending literally a week to build a small wooden shelter and get a few low level Parasarus and Trike tames a level 80 Bronto wonders near our base. While annoying they are no direct threat as long as not attacked.  Then while we are playing it wonders to close and is burned by our camp fire as it cooks meat. This aggros it causing it to attack our base.  Since it is only wood it can be damaged by the bronto. And while they are not the strongest dino on the base game they can pack a hell of a punch.  We are killed instantly. Our dinos attack to defend us and are slowly wiped out. Brontos in that game are tanks with one of the highest HP in the game.  Our primitive bow and arrows and spears won't do jack shit against it.  We die several times in a vain attempt to defend our base. But ultimately we are forced to sit back and watch as this enraged bronto wipes out our entire base, all our food and all our resources. 
---
Our literal weeks of work destroyed in minutes before our eyes forcing us to start all over in another area.  And that is just one of a dozen examples of shit like that happening on a PvE server.  The amount of times I've died the amount of tamed dinos that took weeks to find and hours of work to tame and level up and the sheer number of resources lost.   
---
And that isn't even talking about the Alpha Raptor incident. I thoughts the stone walls would keep us safe. That metal walls were just for PvP.  Boy did that alpha raptor prove us wrong  as it broke though the wall and killed all our tames. And after several dozen deaths we were just able to lure it away from the base. 
---
Compared to Ark Survival Evolved Fallout 76 is like being flown in a private dreamliner jet with a build in hot tub, all you can eat buffet and all the video games and internet I can handle. 
---
The defend the corpse flower event still gives everyone the corpse seeds though. What gives with that?
---
Well that's terrifying. 
---
Lol soy mouth Redditor getting this offended over a comment.
---
And I‚Äôm not even trying to be a dick. I have never had issues with items. Lead? My camp is on a vein. Plastic and cloth? I go loot Camden park (also shotgun shells and steel). Black titanium? Got a source. Gunpowder? Gotta throw the shit away. Gears and screws? I can‚Äôt give them away. I‚Äôm sitting on 550 lbs constantly full of stuff 30 fusion cores cause I‚Äôm a hoarder and love my Excavator PA to help hoard
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not killing scorch beasts over and over and over. I haven‚Äôt even unlocked white springs bunker yet. Maybe I‚Äôm not at the point where I‚Äôm burning too fast. But still. 
---
Yeesh
---
Haha me too, I want to jump in eventually but this last Inside The Vault was so empty. Like, so they even care this game blows?
---
i do agree.  enclave quest felt the best because although they are all robots now, their operation feels alive and you are actively doing quests to help them out (like redeploying broken uplinks etc).  you aren't questing to a holotape of corpses
---
Wow! I really dig the atrium ceiling in that Overseer Office pic. Something about straight walls and that flat ceiling instead of the usual slanted walls up to the ceiling just looks cool and interesting to me. Almost retro-ish. Idk. Stoked to see all of this in-game when it opens!! 
---
Thanks for sharing! I hope Bethesda understands though. You‚Äôre def not the only person I‚Äôve seen mention fast traveling to an event and ending up in a Vault instead. Seems to be a somewhat known bug. 
---
I‚Äôd make a new character if you don‚Äôt fancy levelling up. If the patches have show us anything, it‚Äôs that we can‚Äôt rely on the devs. 
---
You‚Äôre helping the other residents of vault 76. 
---
That is exactly what I was thinking. If they can't give us the world, I believe perks applying to stash limits would be a larger gain than whatever minuscule increase they are considering.
---
It's over. You've won.
---
He loves lamp... 
---
Your pictures show a 5x5 pyramid, but the camp area can actually hold 7x7.  I'm trying to build a 7x7 pyramid, but opting to use regular floors instead.
---
If you claim Workshops you op in for pvp. Othee players can just attack you even with pacifist. Only fix is reloging. 
---
Why do people blueprint their base when I move mine it stores it as blueprint 
---
CREEPY AF..
---
Not sure I follow the ‚Äòpositive points‚Äô part
---
Trust me when I tell you, there'll be a fair amount to look at in that vault.
---
I hope they do, I was just so excited and surprised to find myself there. I know someone else commented the same thing happened to them, but I'm the one that blabbed over Reddit :P
---
I haven‚Äôt confirmed it since it happened. I‚Äôve only got one character but I can say that was how I got my first one. It‚Äôs got something to do with taking it off during the event. I haven‚Äôt had the chance to play  in about three or four weeks so it may have been fixed by now.  
---
Awe dang.
---
I‚Äôm level 115 or so and at this point leveling up is just an annoyance that slows me down when I want to change perks.
---
You were right. No manners!
---
That's pretty much all I do now. Takes me hours to explore, loot, repair, glitch PA for more carry weight, fast travel (sometimes), sell crap to vendor bots, rinse, repeat. I do still find new spots every once in awhile but mostly I explore more in depth now. Wait for a nuke drop, loot the hell out of nuked flora, and still not have enough to build the kick ass calibrated shocks I spent 7200 caps on to add to my well earned Nuka Armor. Also realize that I need to be more social so I can drop a nuke and end the damn game. I have a lot of time to think when I do this, I guess lol.
---
But I don't believe expanding it via perks does anything beyond adding an another annoying step for players to have to juggle their perks.
---
And if they don't have to juggle their perks/stash to keep it balanced, then it just effectively increases the stash limit, making it being tied to perks an unnecessary step.
---
I hope this isn't the case. I can't stand companies that do this, and until they are held accountable they will still do it to the consumers. 
---
I have 1 char. Sneak vats sniper build with a supressed tse handmade for heavies and a bloodied pickaxe(no perks) for low levels and nuke zones. 
---
Incoming cap nerf, each cap only worth 1/4 of a cap
---
The server disconnected on my friend and when he logged back in, he was up two levels.
---
Level 59 on Xbox, at I'd estimate around 100 hours. I only usually play for an hour or so at a time, though.
---
for those who don't want to watch the method is just "kill high level players for caps" 
---
This 100% all day every day. I know it‚Äôs not an option for everyone but it‚Äôs the best way to do it. 
---
Yep, I feel the same way. First thing I do when I log in is claim two workshops, one has a single junk pile and then Charleston. I have my C.A.M.P. on a junk pile. It takes literally minutes to set up excavators and let free scrap come rolling in. A couple hours nets you 50-60 of some prime repairing and building materials, for free. I don't get it. Some people don't want to farm, fine, you don't have to but even this is too much to ask I guess. 
---
I usually avoid SBs unless I'm farming Ultracite or I feel like it and I'm like halfway done with the main quest. I went broke a week ago buying all the new plans available and have been saving up for mutations. I don't get the complaining tbh.
---
Your ironic comments are hilarious
---
I already answered that. I said firstly people can choose how to manage their stash if they want to fill it with junk or with weapons and armor. It's their choice what perk cards they use to fill up their stash. Secondly, many people are already having a very annoying time juggling carry weight perk cards. So it won't change anything in that regard for those who actually need it.
---
I have a 2 hand melee build it‚Äôs epic because you don‚Äôt need ammo and some weapons take next to nothing to repair 
---
They are never going to give us a limitless stash.
---
I believe this solution is better than a trivial static increase and adds weight to your "always on" perk choices.
---
Better aspects of the game, sorry misquoted. 
---
Are they worth using?
---
Btw sorry did not know you were sensitive, so allot of the time someone will say something and the other will say what....  or really....  or give more info..... you know during an discussion then it might end with thats amazing thank you for that it is a life changing event you are my hero..... feel better buddy. Not taking a piss just saying please and thank you 
---
Not quite brother.  As Bonesince1997 said, the suggestion is to tweak the Sort by Spoil itemisation.  
---
I met up with a few players this morning and we swapped out ammo and other stuff - no caps w/trades.  Respect yo.  That‚Äôs what the game should be about.  Not the level 25 pissant that showed up later at WS golf club demanding trades and when rejected started griefing and he got his.  Trying to front on me and he got a tasty 1 shot samwich.   Why people try to fuck with you I have no idea. You be respectful and pay it forward and it makes the game so much more enjoyable.  
---
Oh my God. That would scare the shit out of me. I had someone fast travel right next to me with the faschnacht man mask on and I pretty much screamed. I think I'd faint if I saw Mothman in my bed.
---
Omg another drama filled I‚Äôm leaving post just stop 
---
Yes remove starched genes and rad-away (or decontamination shower)  to remove mutation, be careful because multiple can be removed at the same time
---
Oh I know. I don't attack people's camps anyways. I'm pointing out the justification for people being frustrated with them in that location. If I see someone at the camps, I give them a heads up about the spot. 
---
It is hard to find the people if they aren't in the camp though. Luckily you don't have to wait too long for someone to show up and shoot it, prompting them to TP in to defend it. 
---
It's around a 1 out of 10 roll for the vendor. It just sucks to have to sit through that loading time to find out you don't even get to roll because someone plops their camp in the middle of the pond... only to encounter it the next time... and then the next time etc. 
---
Xbox?
---
My routine. Log in. FT to Munitions/Hemlock/Poseidon. Claim. Quick Def set up. Drop quick base. See defense mission. More than one wave of something I don‚Äôt want to fight?/SB?  I fuck right off until it becomes a retake. Idk if this happens every time but when I duck out on a SB it eventually will come up for defense/retake again with some other mob and I can just got kill that instead. The I just pick up all those sweet rewards in the generators. 
---
Oh noes, we're losing a-
---
Oh, you literally never played it, so you were never a member of the community to begin with and never will be.
---
Thanks for stopping in to tell everyone how your opinion is literally meaningless bud. 
---
Do robobrains (robotrains?) not drop them anymore? 
---
The whole Abbie‚Äôs bunker quest line. She was my favorite holotape character and So far the only one I would have liked to meet in game.
---
Level 445. 825 hours played. 
---
I enjoy playing 1 character and making myself as strong as possible. I dislike pvp and can't stand battle Royale games. I'm awful at FPS games, but VATS is lovely. 
---
I've played each fallout since 3 for hundreds upon thousands of hours. Fallout 4 Frost (fan made mod, extreme survival mode) being a personal favorite of mine. 
---
The next game I'm super excited for us Borderlands 3. To me, Borderlands 2 is the closest game possible to fallout 76. Looting and shooting and getting stronger. I was a hardcore wow player for many many many years. Character progression and building strength is why I play. 
---
Add Me, "Niebauer". I play on Xbox and am very active. I think I'm level 15 now 
---
limited time limited edition nuka cola dogmeat follower
---
\#1600 atoms
---
Did the terminals actually have lore on them?
---
a very long video for "Killing people makes them drop caps!"
---
Also pretty sure those caps come from the players' inventories, so once they run out you won't be getting them.
---
Me and my friends have gotten into all the vaults using the frame glitch and haven't been banned, to get out all you have to do is fast travel somewhere else.
---
Vault 92 is 100% complete except for quests and keycards, vault 96 however not so much, there's stuff unfinished all over the place and even a terminal thats only entry is "flavour text" which when clicked reads "to be written". Hillariously there's also one right at the end of the vault that says complete mission and when you click it a text entry pops up saying "nice work assholes!".
---
This is obvious. At some point you have to acknowledge that smoky smell in your nose is going to lead to a fire.
---
I was thinking about this too as I don't PVP but want trophies.  If killing the same player over and over counts, I don't mind dumping all my junk at camp and being a pincushion for 20 kills (only level 11 as just started) if you wanna add me, CharleneC88
---
There's no way to guarantee which mutation is removed. It's a 50-50 gamble. I'd suggest buying serums now that you have one that you like. They're super cheap these days at r/market76
---
Where‚Äôs the proof? Honestly until I see that this is just reddit regurgitated bs. This sub and game has had so many issues arise and then later get debunked as flat out lies it‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
I think I bought one at whitesprings a month or 2 ago. I specifically remember it because there were 2 plans for basketball hoops at different prices so I was intrigued
---
Literally made a vid of the pictures that one guy just posted no credit to him smh
---
I‚Äôll check it out and report back momentarily!
---
Use ionized meat 
---
I kinda stopped playing about a week ago. Once Anthem is out i doubt ill play this game for a month+. They need to fix a lot of things, and updates are not really focusing on what people are saying and always include things NO ONE complained about. They need to be A.) Adding new content, and B.) Focusing on the biggest issues people have without adding in side things.
---
Honestly it feels like they wrote this game off and are waiting for people to stop playing.
---
Lol ok.  I‚Äôll add you and look for you tomorrow if you‚Äôre going to be on.  Thanks. 
---
You should see 92, 63 isn't that big in comparison and the thing is complete lore terminals and all. 63 is about 50% done and 96 is just hillariously unfinished, they used two desks to fill in a doorway where the door was too small to fit! XD
---
It‚Äôs a multiplayer game a console wouldn‚Äôt be really fair unless you are talking about your private server then it would be a cool thing 
---
Just an FYI you can tag things for search even if you didn't run out by inspecting the junk in your pipboy.
---
It depends on the person. I‚Äôve been seeing posts saying the plans are impossible to find and I just wanted to show they‚Äôre in the game. I doubt many people have tried farming req drops.
---
 Its fine. I'm old I don't care. ;)
---
 I do try to encourage civility though. It seems to be going out of fashion. 
---
It was literally the top of my front page. Not r/all. Dont call me salty when you are too mad to think clearly.
---
This so much just stop playing the game we don‚Äôt need to be a drama queen 
---
No, the ones we checked out had functions within the vault. The picture I've shared only had the fire suppression system option. Another one had a cooldown option (possibly for the maybe nuclear reactor also pictured).
---
The only thing that will bring the player base back is quality dlc, and if Fo4 is anything to go by, that likely isn‚Äôt going to happen (Far Harbor being the exception). Also, I wouldn‚Äôt call this sub negative. I‚Äôd call it brutally honest. Let‚Äôs face facts, this game is a dumpster fire at best. 
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken, Todd Howard talked about how there would never be P2W micro-transactions at the E3 reveal. He reiterated this stance at PAX Australia, after the datamined code was leaked.
---
Whilst the datamined code proved the existence of lunchboxes, there is zero evidence that they will be P2W items. Clickbait merchants have used the speculation to fuel the fire, speculation that at least has some merit, if you chose to not believe the Game Director.
---
I personally am comfortable in taking Todd Howard‚Äôs word for it, at least certainly more comfortable than I am in trusting clickbait media outlets. 
---
 Its amazing where you can put a 'nade with that arc. ;)
---
1000 caps? 
---
I think so. When I first crafted my Excavator PA it had a thin white bar that partially filled the yellow health bar of each armor piece. Once that white bar was depleted the normal yellow health bar started to deplete. 
---
I don‚Äôt have the perk that lets you over-repair so when I repair my PA it just refills that yellow bar. So I think higher INT lets you craft a piece with higher initial health/durability but you need that repair perk to maintain that level... if I understand that correctly. 
---
Me too mate sorry
---
Spoiler alert: [Your girl's cheating on you with Mothman.](/spoiler)
---
It is a power armor bug that‚Äôs been around since at least launch. It doesn‚Äôt seem to affect your armor ratings, but I HAVE noticed the unequipped piece seems to count toward your weight limit.
---
The are perk cards that make many of these issues not so bad and having a melee weapon or two can really save you ammo and weapon repairs.
---
The fuck!?
---
&gt;  Sometimes, the game just gives you a canvas upon which to paint your own picture.
---
Except this game clearly has a story. Now given that the discussion seems to have come to the 'Just ignore the story and do your own thing' angle I'd say that wraps it up nicely. The story is boring and badly written to the point that the enjoyment of the game comes from ignoring it.
---
I mean it‚Äôs a little more than that I do give ways to provoke fights and cycle them as well as how to find a player that will more likely fight back
---
Yeah we realised that. Eventually ha! It's a relief to hear other vaults have been cracked and nothing terrible has happened. May still get banned for sharing pics, tho. Jury's out on that until I try to log in tomorrow. 
---
That's hilarious! I hope they keep the complete mission text. It would make my day.
---
lol the dude typed up a post about what he'd like to see and now we're all suckers doing a highly paid dev's job for them?
---
Where do they make people as stupid as you?
---
This same thing happened to me. Joined the event and fast travelled me in. 
---
Look at these idiots downvoting you. They think you can just equip a super sledge and do 10k damage "casually". I've never even seen that damage on my melee, though I never tried because it's completely pointless 99.99% of the time, and I do a lot of min maxing and have a lot of very good gear.
---
Wow. A non hate post for fo76. Haha
---
For some reason I've seen 2/3 of mothman spawns immediately outside my camp, as well as one flatwoods monster.
---
Also a powered door with Keypad on the outside not the inside. Kind of backwards logic dont you think?
---
Hey, I'm a newbie to breaking and entering. I wouldn't know what to look for in regards to content not yet created. I was just stabbing an educated guess at what I'd seen. Seemed pretty much complete.
---
lotta grifters on this sub today it seems
---
I can ussually find one by the train pylon on the east side of cranberry bog.
---
They need to fix it for sure
---
I use scrapper all the time, it would be nice to get more rare components but I think it's fine as is. Currently I can do a 10 minute run and have nearly 400 steel for making ammo. Without it it's very tedious to maintain auto weapons.
---
I‚Äôve noticed the community trickling down on PS4 too. I used to only ever go to Whitesprings in Power Armor or a hazmat suit cuz a disconnect could almost always mean respawning into a freaking nuke zone and dying immediately. Don‚Äôt have that problem so much anymore. I‚Äôve seen maybe 2 nukes at Whitesprings the past few weeks now. Handful of players here and there... it‚Äôs kinda great cuz there are less buttmunches running around but at the same time worrisome that everyone is leaving. 
---
i think youre supposed to feel like its for your fellow vault evictees.
---
As far as I know they don't but what I did when I was low on caps was invite everyone near where I wanted to go into a team just to fast travel.
---
This is awesome
---
I experienced something similar last Saturday night for a couple of hours. I'm only lev 24 so when I saw a 116 killing everything at Whitesprings, I steered clear. Turns out she was definitely my benefactor, providing me with a fusion generator, nicer bed, industrial purifiers, and a few other nicities. She also beckoned me to move my camp to a little pond outside the Nuke zone of Whitesprings. While the new camp was beautiful and very self sufficient, the only thing I lacked was protection, as I was slightly out of range of the robo security she had a little further in.
---
Well, I had one of those lovely glitches getting stuck between a wall after I exited the power armor she'd also gifted me, so I had to leave the server. When I came back I got the error that my camp couldn't be placed, but I could move it at no cost, or it would be re-placed on my next login. I wanted my camp, so I logged out and when I logged back in, I got the same error... Almost. This time the message was that my camp couldn't be placed but I could move it at no cost... No option for a next time.
---
Guess what? When I moved at no cost, I lost the ability to build 80% of my camp, including of course the fusion generator but even my blueprint of my building because apparently none of my components were stored and even concrete was out of reach.
---
Major let down. I'm a little discouraged because I don't get to play often, and now when I do log back in I'll have to rebuild everything after lots and lots of scavenging. üòï
---
&gt; Where‚Äôs the proof? 
---
as I said, the lunchboxes are still in the code, I never said definitively, but evidence suggests they were a planned feature that either got scrapped or is going to get re-worked and then released later due to fan backlash.
---
&gt; This sub and game has had so many issues arise and then later get debunked as flat out lies it‚Äôs ridiculous. 
---
two is "so many"?  what about all the other legitimate issues?
---
Nuke whitesprings and travel to the service entrance. That's where I got it.
---
I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word 'transparency' and expect anything to happen. 
---
Eh - I like the story, and I actually like that it's told "in the voice of the dead", as it were. 
---
I also like that - if you follow the story through to the end - you get some pretty good environmental storytelling. I'm not sure why people are clamoring for NPCs; the standard "3 different voice actor" rubber-faced NPCs from past FO games are something I'm very happy to have avoided in this game.
---
Lastly, I also like not being the hero, but just some schlub who had no compelling reason to do these things. Being "the chosen one" gets a little fucking boring the nine billionth time you've done it in a game. Sometimes, it's more fun just to be some random idiot who succeeds because you *want to*, not because you're the destined hero of legend.
---
Some people fanboy Bethesda even when they know the game will be trash and give them money anyway. 
---
They weren‚Äôt BS though. Bethesda just pulled back from them.
---
Could we also be able to remove stairs regardless of wether it means the area above will be inaccessible? 
---
Seriously, this shit is really annoying especially after working on a difficult build... either I accept the stair placement I no longer want or I have to move my camp so it all breaks down and I rebuild all over again.
---
Then if you don't like it 18 levels to switch back.
---
Maybe the game shouldn't need fallout slapped in the title a should be good regardless. 
---
At level 50 you have the option to choose any card each level 
---
No need to estimate, just look at the achievement menu to see your game time 
---
Honestly the server crashes are down a lot from a month ago. 
---
Thanks! Sadly, don't have any friends who play on pc, they all play on ps4 or xbox
---
Thanks for the offer. Great responses from the sub make me feel welcome... I'll try something else for now.
---
Why low level people? Why not people your own level? Why not just claim workshops and wait for someone to come and try to take it from you then fight them? You aim at the workshop bench. They walk up to it and as soon as they hit that button you unload or VATs melee or whatever into them. I used to think they had the advantage in that situation because they get to choose, but you get to be ready for them and hit them the second the initiate.
---
This map is a good reference.

&gt; If I‚Äôm not mistaken, Todd Howard talked about how there would never be  P2W micro-transactions at the E3 reveal. He reiterated this stance at  PAX Australia, after the datamined code was leaked. 
---
devs say shit...  he also said "it just works".
---
&gt; I personally am comfortable in taking Todd Howard‚Äôs word for it
---
I'm not
---
&gt; at least certainly more comfortable than I am in trusting clickbait media outlets. 
---
I don't get my information from "clickbait media outlets"
---
&gt;However, and perhaps this is where we diverge, on a national or global level your character does have information that there are other survivors. First being that there are other vaults still across the nation. This was common knowledge before the bombs fell, while no doubt some of those vaults would end in disaster some would not. (Unless your character is a big pessimist which is an okay route to go in RP)
---
The character has information that when they went into the vault. Now they are outside the vault everything they are presented shows no people anywhere are currently alive. Imagine if you went to sleep on evening, knowing that across the world people are alive. Then you wake up the next morning, no TV, no radio, no internet, no phones and everyone you come across as you explore outside is dead. Also as soon as you get outside you find a note saying 'Do this right now or you will die'.
---
&gt; The other part about the Brotherhood of Steel is important because it at least highlights that people survived the bombs dropping. 
---
We know that from Appalachia. The responders and the raiders weren't killed by the nukes.
---
&gt;You‚Äôre right when you say they is no definitive proof that California survived after the destruction of the satellite but there is also no proof that it didn‚Äôt.
---
Proof that there is still people out there when every other aspect of human civilization within the game narrative ends with 'oops, they ded' is pretty much required. It's not just that there is no definitive proof that someone outside West Virginia is alive, it is the persistent reminder in the narrative that everyone else within the game boundary is actually dead. All it would take is one quest, one single solitary breadcrumb given by a actual person via a comm link instead of everything coming from MODUS and holotapes and robots. As you said yourself:
---
&gt;In this way I think the world of fallout 76 presents a situation where it may be too late for the West Virginia area but it‚Äôs not too late for the rest of the world.
---
So **show** us that it's not too late. They didn't write Skyrim where everything was a charred wasteland and the Dragonborn had to guess that there might be a bunch of people holed up in a Whiterun basement. And they also shouldn't rely on meta knowledge that Fallout happens so there are people in the Mojave and Capital Wasteland to save.
---
I thought it was nice at first but it's really harsh now in application. Like op he needs about 18 levels to try a new build, then 18 more if he doesn't like it. That's a massive grind, and you won't get too many respecs before you're burned out.
---
I think more people are mad about the perk nerfs. That just seems unnecessary. I've never held a TSE, but from what I hear they made ranged weapons actually viable. But if they want to nerf that, then fine. Don't nerf demolitions expert, though. Explosives were already super underpowered 
---
Have you never played an online game before? "Daily quests" are always repetitive junk. 
---
I started solo and have continued up to 140+ solo, so I know the feeling. I keep charisma on 4 for the lone wonderer and swap out travel agent and hard bargain.
---
I wished for this at one point, but then I decided to try and stop hoarding... 
---
Getting rid of 200 lbs of chems and food (sold to vendors) and 400 lbs of junk (crafted ammo and weapons to farm mods, sold 25 lbs of anaseptic... Ect) hurt, but was worth it because I could use different perk cards in the strength and agility tree
---
Are you running in true full-screen? That matters 
---
I'm glad one other person has played other games.
---
slot the half off construction perk card it makes defense much cheaper 
---
But then your forcing s player to always be stuck with those perks. That really goes against the whole idea of the perk card system. 
---
And that seems like a poor choice. 
---
More so when we already know that they fully intend to increase the stash limit. 
---
It's a great cpu for gaming. 
---
He just means random people on the map.  If there's a dot near where you want to go, send an invite, if they accept fast travel to them for free.
---
enough disappointments will do that for you, i know from experience
---
there is a bug to get your AoE mutations to hurt other players. If you've ever been in danger because someone else hit you (even if you didn't return the handshake), then you have half of how the exploit is achieved.
---
I didn't have them that high to begin with.  I had it running at 1280x720 with texture quality high but water, lighting, and shadows at low, depth of field off, and the fade sliders where they would be on medium settings (between the lowest and about a quarter of what they could be).
---
Not really, I mean I got mine off collecting some bounties and a rando or two initiating combat back before dupers and all the good builds were adknowledged.
---
Still just try and pick up a couple bounties you'll be fine. 
---
Str +3 Cha -5
---
RIGHT?!?!?
---
I‚Äôve tossed a ‚Äònade through windows taking out several inside. And those that come out usually do so limping and mostly dead. 
---
Why fuck them, all of the fallout games involve killing..... You are essentially an invincible God in the other games fighting against AI and when you die you reload a save, in this you still have the AI enemies in addition to fighting humans with actual intelligence.  The responders, raiders, BOS and US military all vacated the area or died pretty horrible deaths so the area clearly isn't meant for setting up a homestead and retiring just yet
---
I see you have done lived up to your fullest potential.  Congratulations.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4, I can confirm that the game doesn‚Äôt crash every 30 minutes now. Other than that, it‚Äôs still as shit as it was in the beta. (If not worse) 
---
It didn't do this on the MOD that they referred to as an "exploit" in patch 4
---
Are you a ranged weapon user? Ever looked at your stance when aiming with a ranged weapon?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even 
---
Nice Billy Talent reference
---
&gt;Lastly, I like not being the hero, but just some schlub who had no compelling reason to do these things. 
---
Which is fine. But it doesn't exactly mesh with the story Bethesda has written where they try to give you a compelling reason to do things. But fail at it.
---
Fallout 76 would probably be better if there was no 'You need to save...*someone*' storyline and it was just about bustling around making everything neat and tidy again. Putting down some raiders, helping people set up little encampments because they don't know how to build a generator, scooping up super mutant poop.
---
&gt;Honestly, I think the majority of people who didn't enjoy the story of this game have short attention spans.
---
But you're here saying the part you enjoy is not being the hero, not being the guy the story forces you to be.
---
184 levels across 2 characters, 417 hours, PC.
---
Used to try to at least get through the atom challenges every day, but my enthusiasm for the game is waning with the lack of new content. Playing between 2-4 days a week now.
---
Getting rid of junk you don't need and setting personal loot rules is a given.
---
My heavy gunner needs 40 steel per one craft of .50 cal. I'd rather have a substantial stock if steel than wait6until I'm completely out to gather steel again.
---
Fireproof (makes dealing with scorched beasts easier) and strong back (makes collecting junk so much easier!)
---
And and all of the melee perks (one gives 75% armor reduction at Max level)
---
