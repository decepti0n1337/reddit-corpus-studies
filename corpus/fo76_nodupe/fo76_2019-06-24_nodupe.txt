You launch a nuke for the final boss to spawn

Pretty ironic that they both come from the same quest.
---
Been waiting for it in the shop too.

Ya I’m a vats user looks like I’ll be skipping that gun then. How’s the plasma caster?

You’re welcome!

Never had a ban for actual voice chat, though I’ve not used ingame chat since the Black ops 2 days tbf. Last ban was when I had someone spamming me because they lost and I got banned for replying “stop crying like a lil bitch” lol

You will be kicked off Reddit before the actual game lol.

This one is bugged since release for everyone. Support wont help you, but you can submit a bug report if u want. (Some say you need to do last hit on SBQ to count but it's not confirmed).
---
How dare you move your tent so it's not convenient! You just wait. He's already got his friend onto you. Next his Mother, Karen, will be telling you how could you do that to her baby. You know you've ruined both his birthday *and* Christmas  for the whole family,right? Mark my words,Mister, you're in deep trouble.
---
So close to release i doubt it they will change their schedule.
---
What is sbq?
---
If you have to choose the fixer is probably better as far as dps.on another note 5.56 ammo is pretty cheap to craft.both are solid so pick the one you like or hell take both!
---
I love when I find people like that too on Xbox, especially the ones that tote the fact that they have a crew of people, “and it wouldn’t be a good idea to mess with me“, those are my favorite
---
i have done this before, was right after a queen fight i came back to my tent like 5 minutes later over, weight from gathering mats and there where 3 guys afk in the entrance to my tent in power armor. so i moved my tent lol problem solved. sorry guys
---
Someone dropped me 1500 today for teaming for free fast travel. Someone on Facebook has over 200 million
---
It just doesn't offer any benefit to a rifle build. Weapons degrade so slowly anyways, and are usually cheap to repair to begin with, devoting so many points to it is just generally wasteful. You could put those points into luck, for instance, and get "luck of the draw". It gives a chance to repair your weapon whenever you use it. Less point allocation, and it provides a better bonus.   
---
Or if you aren't using power armor, you may run into fights where you get overwhelmed, you could put some of those points into ricochet , which gives a percentage for attacks to bounce off you, which is extremely helpful, and makes you feel like a badass.  
---
Things like these would help you out a great deal more than most of those points in intelligence. If you need gunsmith, then I'd do 5 points in intelligence, and then distribute the rest of those into luck or agility. You wouldn't be getting into meta territory, but you'd have a much better time, and I love using ricochet, it's fun running through a crowd of super mutants and watching them keep missing you.
---
Well thought out. I agree with most of your post.
---
So many people asked for it.
---
It’s really a nice bundle and should be year round
---
My guess is stupid mofo
---
Ni!
---
I have called in the nuke myself and killed her solo ....that challenge is just bugged
---
You do need the perk installed.but best thing is you only need it when crafting so see if there is any perk you wouldnt mind running always like energy ammo reduction or nerd rage then swap to your craft perk when crafting and swap back.kinda sucks but nerd rage saved me alot
---
Meg takes in the outcasts that no one else will. Even though she is a sadistic bitch she is the only one looking out for the ones that are too different to live anywhere else.
---
I'm betting a Bloodied, 25ffr, 15r would be considered a god roll for a gattling laser. I know I'd do some questionable things for that.
---
I'm English, we do have the chicken royale here with or without bacon, I've seen it on a BK menu as "long chicken" before
---
Damn and I thought 300 was a lot. I definitely got enough caps to buy a few Serum plans that's for sure! Since the game is such a grind I don't feel bad either.
---
I’d like the porch posts and roof the most, sadly I blew my Atoms on the Liberty Prime skins lol.
---
Did we just become best friends?
---
You're not wrong, it adds so much functionality to house-building.
---
A lot of other games have permanently available 'upgrade' or 'quality' items like this that would still be consistent sellers without applying FOMO to them.
---
Try to get the plans from a player not WS bunker. Save a bunch of caps.
---
Theres over 300 possibly more than 400 in there, I counted to 320 and stopped lol
---
Hey way off topic but congrats and as a father of two, I wanted to say that gaming for you is not over...gaming endlessly for 6 or 8 hour spans is dead to you,  buuut your life just got upgraded to the baby DLC so you will have lots of crazy adventures ahead - eh, actually not for a while. honestly infants are cute but boring AF. Right around 18 a 24 months is where the fun kind of starts. 
---
My boys are 2.5 and 10 mo. And I manage to get in 2 or 3 hours  at night
---
There needs to be so much more of... EVERYTHING. They should start off my reworking how you change your special points. I can't even get rid of my old melee build!
---
How many matches do you play a night? Or day? I’m a fellow bush wookie. I used to play but I gave it a rest. Would ten matches a day make a difference? I’m lvl 40
---
This. If you are a gunslinger you'll want it.
---
Wasnt sure what it meant myself, googled it and it came up in urban dictionary as "sexy motherfucker" lmao
---
Fixer has slightly higher damage and the sneak buff but it has awful recoil outside of vats, whereas you can mod a handmade to have almost no recoil.
---
What's a 23th? Is that like winning a race and coming 1rdth? Asking for a friend...

the anal invader should be a skin for the regular baton.

i think we might have to mail an anal invader to todd to get them to change it.
---
Whaaaaaaat!!!! Good to know thanks!!
---
how about like an actual scrap pile?
---
just a random pile of shit for people who pile random shit in the random shit corner.
---
Pretty much everyone there was on my tent, too many up there lol while me and my friend constantly died from the other shit, so I moved it, he also called me selfish for doing it
---
I gave her an asylum uniform to wear and she's filthy

This should give you reputation for either faction.

---
THREE MINUTE WARNING!
---
Then i'm off.
---
AP refresh will continue reducing the recharge time with each piece, but once you get beyond 3 pieces the difference is less than 1 second, so it's not worth it.
---
Angry Turtle did a video testing AP refresh time using all the different perks and armor effects to find the best balance if you want to see some actual testing.
---
Bloodied, lol. I love both those guns, but fixer helps you sneak.... It's almost the "free radicals mask" of rifles. ( Extra legendary effect...)  I think without sneak, the handmade is better, imho.
---
Can I cross this name off my list or what????
---
As a huge lifetime rpg PvP'er and consider end game to be PvP... what ultimately drove me away for a year are the jacked items and extreme hacking. Duping isn't TERRIBLE (see D2) and those items can be traded for. But the hacked crap + shooting through walls across the map + flying + god mode etc... that crossed the line for me. It becomes a competition of who can hack more, with no gameplay. There are ways to counter Quantums (kill faster). Aid item stacking etc these are different metas. There are definitely some things I'd like to see changed, but I'll leave my personal opinions out because it's not about me. Again, it's about a line that no matter what shouldn't be crossed if you want some sort of semblance of PvP. No exceptions. Just stop the hardcore cheaters, get rid of the custom freak show hacked in legendaries(see fatboy minigun)... implement a flagging system and hire teams to investigate. Add logging and tag items for identification. Update your ToS and make it obvious changes are happening.
---
I call bullshit on that.  Someone always rats me out to my mom.  I need better friends.
---
run both.. they use different ammo
---
Make me a offer but dont insult me now.

I had a guy dressed in Fallout 1st ranger gear do that to me at a player vendor last night. He kept shooting me and hitting me so I put the controller down and got a snack from the kitchen while still looking in the vendor. He never stopped the entire time and it had to be about 10 minutes.
---

Monstrosities, all of them... bees, bears and especially Edna.
---
Handmade imo. 
---
If you’re a sneak build, fixer. 
---
Try to get both. More ammo usage options and you’ll have a weapon for every occasion!
---
I try to squeeze in as many as I can a night. Maybe 10? I did my best work over the double xp weekend. It did get tedious after about level 70, but I found as my familiarity with the map increased, I had more success. My one tip is to scout the map in Adventure and find places you like. I am a goat in the mountains, not a frog in the valley. Jumping off a cliff with goat legs is a great way to break contact with a frog hopper.
---
Gotta avoid that reddit coms ban.
---
I sell the mod. I didn't realize you had to be perked out to use them...never tried to mod one on a character w/o the perks I guess.

---
Had someone write what was easily a 1000 word rant a few weeks ago because he was upset my vendors were on the bottom floor of a two story camp. (You can enter from the top floor too) I even had arrows pointing to them. Tensions are high around even in the fallout universe I guess.
---
So basically fuck the people who bought the game because it was advertised as a game with pvp? If people keep leaving the game we are going to have bigger problems. If you check the playerbase on steam right now there are less than 5.000 people playing, only a few hundred more than New Vegas, that's a drop of about 20.000 people in three weeks.
---
Depends really.
---
Remember they have access to everything you send and receive on their service so maybe they didn't see it the same.
---
Also your friends could get banned for their false reports so keep that in mind too.

I’m ElectronElite on Xbox. I’m pretty high in level but can play and help you if I’m online. Usually on later at nights after 10est
---
I don't mind. My main is level 189 or so but I'm starting up new characters as well, the one I'm working on now just reached 30. So it works out even if you're lower level, I can use one of my low level characters so we're both on the same page.
---
I move my tent all the time during scorched earth. If people huddle on top, I'm moving it 20 yards away. They always go right back, which just makes me move it again.
---
You nailed it with separate servers
---
Just make adventure servers all pacifist 
---
Bring back survival servers
---
And then you can never find him, just like Grahm.
---
It gets really annoying constantly swapping the right perk cards around constantly but eventually you'll learn where they are so it's a quick process and less annoying but like he said, saving some special points for something just as important is better
---
My favorite is how I never flirted with her a single time, but she still constantly says the line about meeting someone amazing in the wasteland and how magical it is. I had to switch her out with a different follower.
---
Glad I still have some OS grenades lying around
---
Can any tell where the freedom neon star signs in the camp building menu are? I looked through all the light options and can’t find them.
---
Take a look around your server on the map.  If you see numerous high level players then definitely nuke that bitch.
---
Hah, your camp seems to be in the same spot as mine. I test my new weapons out on Frank when I can. Frank dies in the name of science.
---
Well my wife is mainland Chinese, so I do have some perspective ;) However, you are right, I shouldn't generalise.

Fixer uses same mods as Combat Rifle. Only need Fixer plan to craft non-legendary Fixers and receive Fixers for scrip from Mrghyhf.
---
Rumors have it they found a way to dupe and trade the new Wastelander weapons and amors....maybe that's why?
---
Willing to trade it? I have s 2 star instagsting gauss with trash secondary perk. This would be an upgrade.
---
I use it along with the gunslinger perk, silencer mod, and vats + 30% dmg bonus. So it's perfect for stealth builds.

To the high-level dude or lady on pc in the Santa suit last night that lured my level 41 ass in to drug me with nukashine and kill me with a tower of punji boards: I hope you step on a lego every day for a week. That was a shitty thing to do. :(
---
MINE LISTENS TOO.
---
EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT.
---
The upward inflection of every word drives me crazy.
---
Thats hilarious. I love messing with people that hop on my tent and shoot her in the air. Eventually they give up or find another tent
---
No patches yet.
---
Could you imagine if *you* ended up banned, and no one would pick up the story?
---
I mean, there has to be somebody that actually knows "someone" with the ability at least.
---
I bought one of those raider sets on Xbox last time. The under armour looks great but clips through chest pieces in a really shitty way.
---
Lol.  Why I prefer to run with 2 pieces with poison resistance. No stink bomb death for this guy! Plus mirelurk kings hardly do shit to me.
---
It is trying to scare off all those communist radroaches and bloatflies....
---
Rather disappointing considering how much better it looks than the tombstone

Personally I prefer the royale with cheese
---
^I’ll ^see ^myself ^out

Freedom isn’t optional
---
So the game is dying, &amp; only the only thing that can save it is pvp... that sounds like a reach, a really long one too.
---
How many players never came back because of the constant griefing by players &amp; the toxic environment that they created with it.
---
A declining player base is not going to be fixed by letting the toxic players come back.
---
Fuck pvp 4 life.

I'd like to point out that after almost 2 years, the Enclave has I shit you not only a SINGLE Atom shop item, being an eyepatch that's part of a bundle.

Way too chipper, wanted to feed her to the Deathclaw next door after 1 day...

Ahh the old 'My friend works at Microsoft! *Reeeee*' All because you moved your Survival Tent there? Sheesh! That guy and his friend are typical screeching nutcases 😃😃😃

I’ve heard that’s what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in France. Don’t remember where though. Big Kahuna burger is better imo
---
I miss xbox shit talking. Nobody sends salty messages on PSN. I used to treasure my Dark Souls hatemail...
---
Semiauto-bots, roll out
---
I want cross save.
---
One or two shots and then leaving is just to see if you’ll PvP, innocent enough. If they’re really going for minutes at a time it’s because if they can get you to fight back, they can destroy your CAMP. They’re trying to piss you off enough to shoot back. Just ignore them, they’ll eventually go away. Even a “No” emote gives them the attention they crave.
---
The bunnyman is here to reap your soul and chills if you want
---
My little kid plays roblox while I play fallout. I keep the volume low and she doesn’t really pay attention to it at all. Except second day with Sofia and my daughter shrieks “just why do you keep saying that! Just why is that lady so annoying!”
---
Now I have to avoid my own camp while we play our games together.
---
Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter...
---
Had this happen while visiting another players vending machine, a player sporting trapper armor and a Tesla showed up, started hitting me, I took my time and then left, saw the player later at another camp were he became the victim of a "boobie trap"... lol,  beware the vending machine with a fog machine in front of it.    Assaulting player name is "X\_3yeMerk\_X" .   this would be on the PS4.
---
I think that it would make a great backpack option. It's almost the exact same shape as the mothman backpack.
---
Yea come on the pride flag thing has been free since I bought the game over a year ago why take a spot for something new to add it in again.... and again and again
---
That’s right, it’s the hunter. No way I’d give up settler rep though!
---
I can barely stomach the dialogue it gives you for romancing her.  So cringey it hurts.  Like a 15 year old's idea of romantic dialogue.
---
I believe pvp will come back eventually since players want a challenge and the way pve content is going that will never be satisfied.
---
It really just needs a separate mode like Eso wvw.
---
Pvp only events: They already have a few pvp event in the game files well why don't they make them public events and remove pve events.
---
Like I said I bet they will re-add it eventually when the player base want a challenge right now people are still enjoying the content.
---
It's nice to have incentives to play different game modes.
---
had a couple of jerks do this today. i turned on my mic and started going "oooh yeah, do it harder Daddy!" they disappeared fast. i got a good laugh out of it and went about my business.
---
I first noticed it when the vault boy/girl pa helmet was only available if I logged in through bethesda.net instead of steam.
---
Yeah changes every week, I think I'd prefer access to time limited skins and outfits from nuclear winter but ultimately all outfits and did should be an ultra rare drop in game anyway
---
No but what op suggested would bring a lot of people who left the game back. With a playerbase so small and getting smaller how long you think they are going to support this game?
---
Cool. 
---
Trap camps are part of the game. 
---
Glitching underground has been around for a long time. I do hope that gets fixed, but even if not fixed I could not care where the camp is or how they try to murder me.
---
This is how dc should be looking around this time tbh
---
Report him? What? You entered a strange persons base in a nuclear wasteland, that sounds like peak 76 to me to be honest.
---
I don't see it mentioned but honestly the best way I found was to buy a second account when it was on sale. One on steam, one on Bethesda. You can run both .exes very easily and just alt tab between characters.
---
Not against any TOS, and cheaper than FO1. Just my opinion!
---
It was July of 2012 just did a quick google search
---
Eh I'm all for defending your camp against mobs. Can't say I like that it can be attacked  while you're not there though. So I could agree with you there. Unless they rework it to be like Workshop defending.
---
Sounds like a nice base.
---
One word:

Hahaha thank you!! Yeah I know I'll need to cut down but it's good to know I might still get some time to play. Thanks for that! FALLOUT DAD'S REPRESENT

I’d prefer it this way. I’d rather just put a skin on my godroll handmade than try to grind out a new weapon.

I feel like if they made it slighter larger and added different detailing it would make a good backpack, so it could look more.. appealing, looking like you just drop a smaller, different bag than the one you have on your back

Punch bowl?

I imitate the way he says button perfectly.

Still haven't found a vendor they has any serums. They'll has numbers under misc but it's always gunpowder. Maybe I'm just having bad luck.

---
If you're going for shotguns, I'd be willing to donate about a 1000 shotgun shells for the cause. Recently swapped from Combat Shotguns to Gauss Shotguns which use a different ammo, leaving me with an absurd excess of shells.
---
Also like...when someone you don't know says "come here" over and over again, they're usually up to no good.
---
Can I cross this name of my list or what?
---
Ah yeah, true.
---
Yup
---
I was stupid in that regard, shouldn't of drank it. Never expected the punji boards to just appear
---
I just give them the double guns taunt and ignore them
---
I lost my best gun today to this. I’m only level 60 and didn’t have anything of value except that gun (got lucky once at the rusty pick). I use displays and punch bowl but I thought they were fixed. My camp often can’t be placed.
---
I was surprisingly sad when I realized I can’t really do public events anymore because my other guns are too weak.
---
Yes there is that and there has always been room for previously released items.
---
At the same time though, a few new things wouldn't go astray. I mean properly new, not cynical reskins of existing stuff.
---
I applaud the build effort because Bethesda, but every big camp I see like this is absolutely empty inside.
---
Happened to me and immediately noped out and took off running the way I came and didn’t stop till it wore off.  Don’t know what was gonna happen and wasn’t gonna find out.
---
I got a full atom refund on that whole pack. Still have access to the items too.
---
[removed]
---
There is also the scorched killers recievrr
---
There is an underground area from a cave to be found now, but not alien, but still cool. I thought it was at first.
---
No other weapons, I tend to vendor scrip them all. Take caps?
---
...and this is why having a messaging system/notice board/etc in-game isn't the best idea.
---
Not without massive restrictions and filtering at any rate.
---
But there are people who think this game has the most wholesome community of all communities. 🙄
---
Shoot me an offer
---
The point is ‘my mom bought me this duped god roll on ebay so now I’m so badass’.
---
That is some gourme shit.
---
Handmade. Fixers are just combat rifles with an extra perk for sneaking. Essentially, a 2 star fixer is a 3 star combat rifle, a 3 star is really 4; just, that last star is always a sneaking buff. I have a jffr handmade, and it's absolutely one of the best weapons I've ever had.
---
Ps4?
---
I have my camp fairly close to the vault just so I can sell stuff cheap to newer players to help them out. I play on pacifist. I'm just trying to kill monsters &amp; play with my kid. Made me not want to play anymore for awhile. Glad you were smarter than me &amp; didn't get caught by the tower of death lol
---
\#1 was terrible, check out how many games have PVP servers that allow character traffic to PVE servers and back. It's almost unheard of, there's no integrity when someone can casually farm ammo and meds and weapons in easy mode and then swap to the PVP server to dominate. I would bet money that #1 was a huge contributor to the failure of Survival mode.
---
I can see where your desire comes from, but you could spice things up by just rolling a char on both servers and playing them as you desire.
---
Does anything make it heal more besides leveling up the perk card?
---
Talk to the runaway raider, convince him to join foundation for some precious settler rep, you still get raider rep for *taking care of it".
---
Pull my finger!
---
Somebody needs a hug. *HUG*
---
Agree to disagree. I know that’s how it’s typically done, but this game is different. And I have zero desire to “roll a new character.”  That’s way more investment than I’m willing to make.
---
2k ? Oh, I'm on PC. Might be important.
---
They need to add the 1st Label. We've been getting additional discounts this whole time but they've done a very poor job branding it.
---
I was out of town for nearly 2 months...3rd week in January to 2nd week in March...and missed out on a lot of Atomic Shop items. Glad to have an opportunity to buy the floor tiles.
---
Yeah I’m on PS4...
---
Doh. Thanks anyway.
---
They don’t give a fuck about any of us! Since the beginning they have been stringing us along to steal money out of peoples pockets, all while under developing this game, yet here I am still playing😩
---
We can disagree, but why's this game different? Open traffic helped kill Survival mode, just like it would in other games, so I think it's very much the same.
---
...you trying out for the new Crash Bandicoot game or something?
---
The only one I look to get is the under armor. Got the country girl last week and will get the stars and stripes one. Need to see more of my armor on my character.
---
What's wrong with moving your tent
---
I saw multiple people saying this in the comment sections of every recent post about Bethesda lying. The majority at that time didn't seem interested in truth, though it would have been nice if some of those folks had posted screenshots too.
---
Always an upvote from me on any adventure pvp posts👍
---
If you are looking for a group to pvp on PS4 add me. My psn is same as my name on here. Got around 6 of us that play regularly. Please send the invite with PVP in the message portion🔪🩸
---
Yea once you get used to it, it's just a few extra seconds to swap em out but I generally don't pick or hack anything unless I have to anymore
---
I had that happen recently. I fled into my camp and up the stairs. They followed me using the follow me icon like, "bring it on" and shot again. I server hopped. My camp over looks a canyon and I hope they fell to their death. Ha.

---
I just feel like Fallout is different somehow. But you’re right, I don’t have specifics. It just feels like there’s an opportunity to include occasional PvE players into the PvP world without hurting anything.
---
I'm sorry that happened to you. :(
---
Are you on PC? Maybe I have something you can use.
---
That happened to me several times today. I wish there was an essy solution. I'm on ps4 and did a full reset twice before it let me log in. I find that it crashes more of I'm idling at my camp.
---
Because the headaches were medical to the extent there was a treatment for them,
---
the Nightmares are Psychological and probably by this point its a form of PTS Disorder from having someone else basically in her mind and then walking up in mid apostcholiptia. 
---
Never mind that knowing you had someone who is basicaly in your skull watching everything you do can be nightmare inducing in and of itself.
---
Very cool! My camp was on a cliff side a while back. I recently moved due to lack of resources in that area. I’ll always remember that camp though.
---
Hold this W king.
---
Give it time. You'll hit a wall once you hit the end game.
---
The early game up until maybe level 60-80 is the best part of the game. After that, it falls off a steep cliff and becomes very unfun unless you live mindless grinding the game for weeks or months.
---
So getting shot with the syringer then getting hit with a nuke mine till you die of rads isn’t forced pvp? Or hitting someone till their electrically charge mutation triggers pvp? This is with having pacifist on. 
---
Let’s get real. Pvpers don’t want to pvp with other pvpers or the hunters/hunted mode will be full 24/7. Pvpers want to grief pve players.
---
Pvp events are called workshops. Go have at it. Or better yet nuclear winter. Or hunter/hunted.
---
it will have more melee too?
---
That is such a good idea. Thanks!
---
I did and it didn’t do anything I’m just salty about the carry weight
---
Homie equipped the "karma pharma" perk with this post
---
They have said nothing about season push back.  Seasons are a new cash cow so I’d bet money we are getting that.  150 atoms to skip one level, and there are 100 levels.
---
No snark, just asking: 
---
If there truly is this massive group of PVPers, why didn't Survival stick around? When it was around, why was it the mode to do the Vault 94 raid with the given reason being that, because there was less people in the world, it ran smoother?
---
I have zero doubt that there's a dedicated group of PVPers but, man, I don't think it's as large as the vocal members make it out to be.
---
That's awesome! I try to do that for low levels as well. The only time a high level dropped anything for me was spoiled meat. They gave a heart emote and fast traveled away. I was cracking up. I collected it and stored it in a tool box on my way to flatwoods. Ha
---
They'd have to expand the map to make "just" areas for your pvp events. If I'm doing missions and there's a pvp war going on where I need to be then that's a problem.
---
My buddy called a guy a bitch once and got banned from talking in parties and stuff for like 3 days. All you gotta do tho is like make another account and join the party w the second account

---
I don't want it to get fixed. I have a sweet basement filled with frog jars and mothman paraphernalia. It's not a trap base. Just a neat little hidden area for the intrepid explorer to discover.
---
Yup, 25% faster fire is awesome.
---
well that's bonkers
---
I doubt they broke it on purpose.  The griefing and the cheating were bigger problems than the amount of money Bethesda was willing to spend on this game post release, so they gave up on it as a feature.
---
I think playing the game makes it clear there are just a handful of devs working on the project outside of the "DLCs" like Wastelanders and the Vault Raids.  All they really have time to do is fix a portion of the bugs, and there doesn't seem to be much if any playtesting of the changes they make.
---
Ya know, funny thing, the real reason I got into Fallout was because of my first kid. I was home on paternity leave and after dusting off my wife's xbox, FO3 was strongly recommended. I don't think I would have been able to get through the first 3 months without that escape.
---
Good freaking lord.  How emotionally and morally bankrupt does one have to be to act like that?  People getting THAT angry about anything in a video game need to put down the controller or mouse &amp; keyboard, back away, wash the Cheetos dust and Monster energy drink residue off their fingertips, take off the Underoos they're spot-welded to, shower off the Axe body spray, and go the fuck outside or something.
---
And, that "pal at Microsoft" thing...like, dude, REALLY?  What are you, twelve years old?  That's something you'd expect to hear on a playground at recess.  "I'm telling, you dink!  My dad knows the principal, and he's going to get him to kick you out of school!  And then he's going to call Santa Claus and make sure you don't get anything for Christmas!"
---
"Messed with the wrong guy".  Please.  My arm isn't long enough for the jerk-off motion that is in my soul.
---
That’s cool. Like I said I really don’t care.  
---
It does not affect the game in any meaningful way. 
---
In fact I like seeing some of. The people do under the map.
---
And I don’t have any diseases that make it so my carry weight is lower and no serums that make it lower
---
Bring back 50 cal paint too.
---
Yes if you have say 2 combat shotguns and favorite them, only one will stay around.  It’s a bug that was fixed and came back.
---
I’ve had issues where Nerd Rage wasn’t worked. Unequipping and reequipping it seemed to solve it for me. If you can figure out what card involving weight isn’t working.
---
if you have speed demon serum, forget about that fixer crouch movement speed bonus , also if youre only VATS abuser then go for fixer, it has higher damage than handmande if u want aim and shoot things  go for handmade, it has almost zero recoil, fixers recoil is on the level of Fatman when u shoot more than 3bullets in a row
---
Uh my dad is the boss at xbox, you got no idea who you're messing with buddy, I get 10 guys like you banned a week.
---
It should either be in lights or will decor, if it hasn't shown up, try server hopping
---
Yeah I have the All rise and 2 other sledges, so that would be why. Hopefully it’s fixed soon
---
DM me his gamertag.
---
No it’s fine
---
Its completely useless for the ban, you just use another account to talk. Signing into 2 accounts doesnt take alot of time, long term Microsoft didnt com ban on 360, so why now? When it is so much less effective, when all your accounts share live. Also they kind of ruin that old xbox charm, where everyone would say they fucked your mom.
---
Still very alive :)
---
They should put these things in the in game menus with links that take you to atomic shop to purchase.  I see thus in camp building mode for some items.  They need to do it for more.  Maybe sell more atoms if they did, idk.
---
I don't about PC but I'm on PS4 and it's fairly active, still getting new content, plenty of people online, plenty of events
---
Damn its tempting... i wouldnt mind standing there and wating for it to load up, if they upped the budget. I had the pleasure of visiting such a glitched camp lately, and it looked freakin amazing, he got himself a god damned castle in the middle of a golf course, i mean sound like Trumps wet dream. He had towers, little square, market, shitloads of decorations, normal rooms, restaurant sections, all filled with decorations, but not like all just dropped, it all looked naturally. I was in awe, just walking around for like 20 minutes. Meanwhile i have to decide wether i have an extra water purifier, or a mask in display, sucks.
---
I'm leader/founder (General) of the Eastern Commonwealth: Brotherhood of Steel, we're a small Xbox roleplay/Milsim-lite group.
---
Our group took inspiration from u/Nymith 'BoS - Operation: h0pe4Future' PC Brotherhood group. Our background/goals are similar but we tend to use legendary weapons/armor that make sense [At least to us] (Anti armor/+50% Limb Damage, +30% damage to Scorched, Regenerating/Life Saving etc. We have it RP wise as high tech gear made by our Scribes)
---
However i can't stress this enough: The group isn't for everyone, i plan on (down the line) to start up a training regimen for new Recruits who are new to Roleplaying/acting in character/patrols etc. If anyone reading this has watched u/Nymith group videos on YouTube (If not then please do so, you won't regret it!: Type it on the YouTube search: BoS - Operation: h0pe4Future), that's what I'm planning on doing. Truly embracing the Roleplay aspects, playing Fallout 76 how it was meant to be played especially with like minded people.
---
We're going to start doing streams on Twitch of our Roleplay adventures/patrols while acting in character (Since Mixer went the way of the Dodo yesterday, thanks Microsoft...):
---
My Twitch:
---
http://Twitch.tv/PaladinKBailey
---
My Sentinel (u/emy1250) Her Twitch: http://Twitch.tv/emy1250
---
We'll be doing Roleplay streams/interact with the Xbox portion of the Fallout community a lot more, plus its something to do. The more the merrier is what i say.
---
Even the man himself 'CHAD: A Fallout 76 Podcast' likes our idea/supports us, I'm honored to have friends like that. Both him and u/Nymith truly have given me fantastic ideas on how to do things over the past 6 months.
---
If we didn't think about the true Roleplay aspects for Fallout 76/what makes Fallout well Fallout then i honestly wouldn't have stuck around for the past year and a half. There's so much potential for this game, never give up. There's always likeminded people who'd love to Roleplay it out in-game. Ask people in-game/act in character, there's always a chance you'll find someone in game chat that'll be Roleplaying it out.

I like this one, its tight but very remote

This guys penis must be huuuuuuge.
---
I heard his dad is Bill gates he might really ban you be careful
---
It doesn't matter which faction you side with, the player is the ultimate raider in West Virginia. Nothing is safe, the 76'ers roll through every location taking EVERYTHING that isn't bolted down and killing anyone and anything that stands in their way. Sure you solve some problems, but rarely with anything other maximum force!
---
I just changed session and it fixed mine, you tried that yet?
---
Okay there's a terminal in the back of the shop that refers to a Mike or something, is that who the purveyor used to be?  Anyone know if that's a correct interpretation?
---
Ya i have
---
as many others, i have one of each. both with vats crit + vats cost reduction. the handmade feels quite alot better to use - both in and out of vats. and ultracite 5.56 uses crimson which is plentiful in queen nuke zones, while .45 ultracite uses cobalt if memory serves, which you pretty much need to make your own nuke zone if you want to farm, as there's only a single plant i know of in the usual nuke zones around fissure prime.
---
There needs to be a way to lock/ unlock things in your inventory
---
Bring survival back so all the PvPers can go there and leave Adventure alone.
---
I checked it’s my backpack that adds the cat weight and that’s not working
---
I made a camp with a cliff side view, too. I love it. Mine is in the mountains between Beck with farms and middle mountain cabins.
---
Basically the energy gun equivalent of a minigun, I love it tho
---
Yes
---
How do you get the half walls back to back?
---
Is he fucking 12? I haven't heard the "Ive got connections im going to get you banned" line since MW2 😂
---
I'm PS4 and would love a solution to this as well! It's so strange.
---
Some cards add a buff to strength which adds to carry weight also. If is you backpack try scrapping and recrafting it
---
I’m not but thank you, I appreciate it. I’ll try my luck at the rusty pick tomorrow, maybe get something even better. Sorry you lost your map!
---
That way no one would make an impulsive purchase for fear of losing the skin, and Bethesda would lose money, so remember that the house never loses.
---
Beckett and his bro are standing in the room as I type this and there is no key in the crib.  Damn Bethesda and their friggin bugs smh...
---
It used to be so good but who knows how long/if it ever it gets fixed, it was like the only comparable high health PA mod to bloodied which has emergency protocols
---
I had a group of guys come in and bully me yester day for what I guess is my character being dressed like a redneck.  They asked me stuff like if I was at the Trump rally.  I took it as joking at first but they kept at it.  Made me want to not play for awhile
---
Yup, hit right after I spawned. I did already get the achievement a while back when I was screwing around and intentionally got hit by one lol
---
Seriously though, the extra loading time is a pain. I'm always just sitting there waiting for quests to update. I understand for the daily quests that have their objective set to a random location of npc(like search and destroy) but some wasted on\[\] sometimes don't even load properly for an hour at least(doesn't tell you which alcohol to drink or what you need to do while intoxicated). On top of that, I've noticed that whenever I try to check my currencies(forget the exact tab name but caps/gold/badges/etc), it is almost never correct. Half the time it shows what I had on the previous character I played on has everything except caps at 0.
---
I did that also......
---
I've got all that to look forward to... :) Thanks again mate
---
Mine has a lead node and south of Monogah mine.
---
I prefer long pork.
---
Um actually it's probably your name. I'm hoping that you are unaware that it's a derogatory name for black people from slave times. You should probably change that.
---
the game is very much alive. while endgame activities are barely a thing, you will no doubt have enough to do for several hundred hours. personally i have 684 hours on steam right now, since wastelanders, and have just been mindlessly farming for the past 100 or so.  
---
but thats still alot of hours of entertainment even for a full price game
---
KD used to Regen a static amount but it is completely broken now, no longer works whatsoever once wastelanders launched, I’ve even submitted a ticket but I’ve heard nothing about the issue from Bethesda
---
Sometimes you just need to vent.
---
Up voted for encouraging people to do Radiation Rumble.
---
It's getting pretty lonely down there.
---
How very Bethesda of them.
---
I pre-ordered it on the bethesda launcher but you are supposed to receive the copy on steam after linking accounts.
---
Flair checks out
---
DEMOCRACY WILL NEVER FAIL
---
Just imagine the amount of ammo he wasted. Even better if it's the ultracite stuff.
---
Still quite alive, as long as you have played the original fallout's I think you'll appreciate this one- fo76.
---
I'm on PC, if you need some advice or items lemme know :)
---
Level 395.
---
thats why i stopped putting it in my vendor for free. every time i did, and looked at who took it, it was ALWAYS a level 100+  
---
i love the community of this game, but greed is everywhere :)
---
Did it break after WL? Just out of curiosity, what was it like before it broke?
---
I came back just as WL and COVID lockdowns dropped so didn't get to use KD before WL.
---
Lol this sounds hilarious! I need to be in your friend group!
---
Sorry, let me clarify. The only thing that happens if your camp gets nuked is that everything except the foundation is destroyed(so you'll end up having to repair everything at the cost of materials). I just made the mistake of trying to quit at the last second to save my camp. I failed to do so and ended up leaving the server right after I died from the nuke, and therefor losing the junk I had dropped.
---
On another note, thanks to MangyMoose76 in the first comment, saved me a bunch of materials by just moving my camp an inch at the cost of 40 caps. Of course with my 10 large water purifiers, covers the cost in a few minutes lol
---
Unyielding pieces is the most difficult one get. You'll get less than 10 crafting over 100 legendary pieces.
---
Lay down 1 half wall, use a flamer trap on it to destroy it, and then place down the other, go back and repair the first one.
---
If you have a TSE with the 33vats perk which is magic, would you get double fire rate for the Two shot, the double again for the explosive? For example a handmade with 75 fire rate would be over the 200 threshold?
---
Not happy about it either, but a pretty typical business practice on digital products.
---
'Data mismatch fooooounnnddd, value unknoooooown....' 
---
Fasnacht bot rapidly climbing the annoying list.
---
Yea I think if they had released hybrid servers as another option then it would have been fine. It's just that Survival Mode was their big chance to make a persistent open world PVP experience, and taking away its balance integrity really hollowed the whole thing out. :/
---
Congrats on 100.
---
Probably because they will be adding an ammo converter.
---
I really want the Berets that were datamined! A Beret with an Eagle on it? Fuck yes! Take my Atoms, Todd!
---
Fingers crossed it becomes available on the 30th when Patch 20 launches!
---
Yes, it was working fine before the huge update
---
Basically I have 100 ap, can take 3 hits, then when I get hit again and it’s depleted my ap jumps back up to a little under half, meaning it procced almost every other shot even with a super mutant mini gunner focusing me. I assumed KD was the best combat option where assembly was the best choice if you wanted to run around, but now it’s just completely busted :(
---
I even made a post about this once WL dropped and I think so few people realized this synergy/never used the combo it went unnoticed
---
Edit : made this post 2 months ago
---

---
Fixed it for me as well but my friend had to rebuild his entire CAMP from scratch because nothing would work for him.
---
This was probably closer to when the game came out but it was absolutely hilarious. Threw one grenade and killed a few. Some other cases I remember of the whitesprings bots overloading was inside the resort buildings, there would be ton spawned behind the counters to the point they just couldn't move.
---
PC here game is very active here as well.
---
LMFAO Say what one more time...
---
Classic
---
"only recently... 1800hrs" lol i've been playing 76 since it came out and am about 1000 hrs behind you. welcome! loot laying around is first come first serve although it will respawn fairly soon if you didn't pick it up. loot in containers is per player so multiple can loot the same container. enemies are indivdually lootable by any player who significantly damaged the enemy. it is considered good etiquette to not kill legendary enemies outright; if there are other players around, allow them to damage or 'tag' the legendary so they can also loot. if you are not into PVP there is a pacifist option in the game settings that will prevent you from accidentally hurting other players (and their camps) and from being hurt by them. happy hunting!
---
What's your ign? I'll add you now.
---
I feel you bruh. Just started w SS and I blew threw 50 modules crafting chest pieces and got 3 Uny rolls, none of them perfect. I could see it taking me the rest of the year to get a full set. And even then the rolls won’t beat my matching Uny/Ap/Sent combat armor set  that I got through trading. I’ve gotten maybe 5 decent 3* armor rolls total in all my time playing (about same level as you) but again none of them are perfect. 
---
The economics of the bullion and scrip with the artificial limits suck ass, straight up.
---
Good luck!
---
I'm not concerned with the map, only posting so maybe people don't lose something more valuable (and some people assume bug reporters are just in denial about accidentally selling/dropping/scripping if they lost something valuable).
---
I hope they fix it, KD and Dodgy have to be the best sleeper combo and if it worked as you said, I will most definitely be running KD instead.
---
Thx, obviously everyone has different experience with the events and I don't think there is a way to make it all fair to everyone, but there should be some way to improve them step by step (I'm also not against to have low level players join events up until they do the best they can to contribute).
---
I'm really worried that based on some streamer I follow the new wendigo event seems fun, but since there is multiple waves of large amount of wendigos during the boss fight that ppl won't care about taking down the boss/finish the event but tagging /  killing the waves for an insane amount of xp/screws.
---
I hope I'll be wrong but I can see that ppl running around with quad rocket launchers / grenade launchers  just spamming it to get as much tags as they can.
---
I absolutely agree that PvE and PvP should be more completely separated besides maybe a duel request feature for PvE players who want to have a friendly sparring match with their friend and not drop their goodies.
---
Two easiest ways to separate it is #1 just to change settings to completely disable pvp damage/flags and then go about your business, no other person can damage you or your camp or maybe not even steal your growing veggies unless you are grouped up and similar to how Borderlands handles duels by slapping each other, getting a countdown and then the unkillable loser just revives on the spot after, no drops, no harm, no foul, but since melee weapons are a thing, this should be triggered by gun bash or heavy attack while not otherwise in combat/caution with other enemies around so nobody accidentally flags pvp on each other during combat if you accidentally shoot each other or swing your weapons around while being swarmed by PvE enemies.
---
\#2 is to completely separate PvE and PvP-enabled servers, I don't think it should require new characters or semi-permanent character transfers to opt into. Simply changing your character's PvP Opt-in setting in the menu between (PvE) and (PvPvE) should move you to a new server to match which one you are flagged for. Balancing can probably remain the same across both of these as they are both the same experience barring the threat of other players, I mean if you look at every single game that separates them, there is always a following for both pve servers and for pvp servers, neither is completely excluded nor has to be thrown in together and forced on anyone for it to work.
---
I don't think any of that has to have anything to do with Nuclear Winter, which can be it's own battle royale game-mode with it's own balancing.
---
That's my take.
---
Wait, why are you placing your tent at SBQ?
---
It prevents her from landing if she's aggrod onto someone standing on top of it
---
This game is getting more toxic than Rainbow Six Siege
---
If they don’t let people transfer their account to next gen consoles , it’ll probably only survive on pc
---
Someone brought that up several years ago.  I’ve had this login for almost 20 years on everything.  Never got flagged or anything, guess I need to figure out how to change it.  I assume since that’s the reason I should have no issue changing it.
---
Yeah, dont put it down during the fight. She cant land if too many are around or if she's aggrod onto someone standing on top of it
---
If you only care about the unyielding effect, I'd do 1* until you get a full set.  It will give you most of what you're after anyway, and you get 4 chances at it vs 1.  
---
It will still take a while though unless you get really lucky ;)
---
i thought the same but weren't sure, ty
---
I ran that for sooo long lol and I noticed literately immediately when it stopped working. But Bethesda is gonna Bethesda, so I doubt any patch will come anytime soon if at all, especially given the low amount of users who use the combo/come to Reddit to voice their concerns about it lol
---
Why just not place it down in the first place so everyone can finish the event faster?
---
imgur is trash
---
🤣🤣 OMG I know! I played my friends character for like an hour or two one day (I was helping make their house bigger, cooler, and ect.) And I swear she must have said it like 30 times. By the time I finished I wanted to kill her so bad I had to give the controller back to my friend so I wouldn't "accidentally" do it and blame it on another FO glitch if my friend asked what happened to his ally. 🤣🤣
---
I had one that spawned just as the nuke zone disapated so I fought him out of the nuke zone. Was pretty cool.
---
+karma
---
I always find it very surprising how the assholes are usually such high levels. You would think that they know the game well enough and how hard those first 30 levels can be.
---
Same here. A little bit happened to the world around that time. Good to get some tile today.
---
Is it a Ryzen?  I have 2 computers with an AMD cpu. One is a Ryzen and one is from about 2012 to 2013.  I've only ever seen it on the new one.
---
Same with crashes which don't seem to happen hardly ever anymore.  Anyone with strangler heart armor shooting the queen was almost a guaranteed crash.  Doesn't happen anymore but they nerfed the armor instead of fixing the code as far as I can tell.
---
Are you on Xbox? I just walked in and the pie was gone lol.
---
Haven't had this issue myself? Where it falls into the map or gets lost?
---
PC
---
I say between big events, like Fasnacht, it's basically boring as shit unless you consider farming gear entertainment. Once the main quests are over there's basically no content except farming and running SBQ. Currently bored shitless with the game and can't even bring myself to just log in to do the daily bullion missions, honestly.

This is mainly for if you have the bug or if you can already get a quest from them. It's both a fix and a way of guaranteeing the quest you want :)
---
Yeah! Did you get in or out of Power Armor while you were there? You might've been in there with me.

But different then the gat plasma?

It's the wrong stuff. Use the Ballistic Bock. Works better. 😂🤣🤷🏻‍♂️

This is if you already have a quest available. You can reset it to get the one you want but sometimes it can fix the weird bug

What would make you think it’s dead?
---
You'll be fine. Most I've held is like 16,000. Got a friend that has 20 million of em spread out across 5 different xbox accounts full of nothing but mules lmao
---
Yeah, sometime is frustrating that you kill the scorbeast just to get a 1 star legendary, so other players nuke whitesprings to farm legendary weapons and armor, fluxes too, ist your choice buddy! 👍🏻
---
So I can get the weapon case all the time?
---
lol you wasted your RNG on a piece of pie
---
Do other locations have more dense amounts of mobs for glowing/hardened mass?  I was having trouble finding anything to kill in a blast zone down by fissure prime.
---
I always hear people talk crap about it so I thought it might have been dead
---
Yeah how hard is it to let you build towards targets. I mean no man's sky will let you do that for a lot of things, and it's pretty bad when you're compared negatively to no man's sky.
---
I actually like that game too.
---
Like in this game I would create an item foundry item for my camp, and you could select one item with all the elements you want from all the elements you know, and then you would just have to feed it for a while and let it run for a certain amount of game time for you to get the thing you want.
---
Meanwhile if you're keeping it well fed you can be out having fun instead of grinding for a target.
---
Bethesda released a 2020 roadmap and there seems to be more content ahead. If anything, I expect to see more people coming into this game.
---
I move mine all the time if people are huddled on top or packed inside of it.
---
Not exactly. I did get a semi-decent 2-Star Legendary Armor piece afterward, so that was nice.
---
Yep. Just did it. I deleted the foragers chair and failed the quest that I already had from him, put his chair back, spoke ti hin again and got the scavenger hunt quest
---
Ah I see.
---
Lol you open to trading out that plasma ? I’ll give you basically all my stuff for a be gatling plasma
---
Me too
---
Look at steam reviews. Those are all post wastelanders (or should be at least)

Whitespring is the most common but Morgan town ain't bad.
---
And also because low level players usually dont have a ton of caps, so they rarely go vendor hopping...? lol. If you meant for that stuff to go to a lower level player you gotta find one and drop it for them.. but if you put it in your vendor for free that just means theres free stuff in the vendor for anyone to take.. You dont get to pick who takes free stuff from your vendor... 😂

I give them a heart. Completely takes the wind out of their sails.

Aren't explosive lasers a legacy weapon. I don't think it would randomly drop. That being said, my pa tank's  stash is pretty full, just from the weight of weapons and ammo. 90%reduced weight would be awesome.

The biggest threat to my CAMP is ATHENA.  They're not capable of doing something as simple as making it invulnerable.  Except by accident.  Like those mobs you sometimes see that don't react and are unkillable.

They do more damage than a handmade, the combat rifle does less.  So there is that.

Make adventure how it was in the beginning and make a server called safe space for all you Care Bears.
---
Anything other than 5.56 and .45 is less than useless to me, so I put all the ammo up for free. I don't care who takes it, because I can't use it. I don't want to spend the time hunting down lowbies to drop it for them, and it feels wasteful to just throw it out. 
---
Side Note: I don't put mini nukes on my vendor at any price because I'm paranoid that someone is gonna use them to dunk my camp. &gt;\_&gt;
---
Both work once your health is low enough
---
If I see someone go through the effort of writing out that it's for new players I leave a vendor alone though lol. Using those small letters to write out a small paragraph is hell so I honor their dedication haha
---
This kind of action has always been a dilemma for myself, on the one side I'm happy the ammo I'm not using is gone and saving me stash space but on the other side that free ammo was meant for someone who really needs and would use it and the guy with the handmade/gatplas combo isn't really going to use it I don't think.
---
Same goes for plans, they are in the vendor for new players and I don't charge for all common plans and recipes but I see a lvl 600 take all 20 table lamps and 10 mirelurk jerky etc etc and know it's not going to use like it could.
---
...but that's what you get for for putting it's price at nothing when greedy people are around, just gotta learn to let go and not worry about it, you can't change them all.
---
I imagine they hope to keep it alive until Fallout 5 comes out with an online multiplayer portion. Whether it stays alive that long probably depends on how much money it continues to bring in.
---
Democracy is non negotiable

I was rebuilding my camp the other day and really wished i had it... two days later my dream came true

You are forced to side with both of them, even though that makes no sense, because the story is as big of a pile of dog turds as Last of Us II.

Well check out the big brain on WillBrayley

Appreciate the tip

I want Captain Kells' hat from Fallout 4.

The Glowing Bulb

That stuff actually blocks damage......
---
You can add me on Xbox. I do it all the time on my fallout 1st server. We can setup a time when I leave the server on and you can do your business . And I’m not a scammer lol. I help out a lot of public players and especially new players. I have some of my best guns on loan to newer players so I have a lot of trust with different people.
---
Last time I dropped stuff for a single digit they bitched that they already had too many stimpacks.
---
I'd have dropped a nuke on him, but fast travel is a thing.
---
That’s because r/nothingeverhappens
---
I've seen people with vending machines labeled "low levels" or something like that. I leave those alone too. But otherwise if something's listed for free it's free game.  whoever wants/ needs it can take it.
---
That setup requires a daft tagging teammate. 
---
Pacifist if solo or on a team of players that don't drag you into pvp blocks all outgoing and incoming damage. 
---
What your asking for is already coming in patch 20
---
That's how I am too, of course that's if I actually want the items in the non labeled vendor. I have one of mine I just put stuff I don't want in instead of dropping it so then maybe someone will get use out of it
---
Is there a list of these anywhere?
---
Oops. Too late.
---
I’m assuming OP has it for the benefit of new players. A level 200 certainly doesn’t need .38 rounds but a new player may.
---
Lol

This went off topic in a hurry. I love it. A.D.D. anyone?

What sound does the whiffle bat skin make? Anyone have an audio of it?

Mine get swapped for other ones of the same type randomly.  My vampiric minigun kept swapping for some other minigun I was carrying, few things like that.  Only seems to happen for a couple types of guns, most of my weapons don't do that.

I don't know either.

Yeah, and I’ve had them switch around too. Most of them are plasma guns so I guess the game just gets confused? Fallout 4 doesn’t have this issue though so I don’t really understand it. It’s not too big a deal though. Usually I make sure to sign off at my camp or favourite workshop so checking my hot keys is part of my beginning prep.

Yeah I was talking overall, I think steam peaks at like 15k or something, more will come with update 20 and following updates on BoS, here's hoping for Bethesda not to blow it.
---
The way that solar and thorn armor work are so much better. I wish they had just gone with that method for all the new items. They could have even used vault steel since it's all tied to a vault anyway. Having to use two legendary modules and getting a terrible one star is so infuriating. I have all the plans for all the Wastelanders weapons and have yet to get a single one that I actually want. I have a couple that are ok, but the rest have just been scrip.

Yeah, there's this weird culture of trying to justify the "bad" factions in the Fallout fandom. You see people constantly trying to argue that the Legion's actually ~morally grey~ because sAfE rOaDs whereas [JSawyer was basically just like](https://jesawyer.tumblr.com/post/133867000061/3-disclaimers-i-love-new-vegas-love-the-legion) 'yeah they're irredeemably evil, the end'.

Check player vendors. 1* Unyielding is very popular and I see them in there a lot.
---
That'd be awesome too. Or Hell: An actual 'Brotherhood of Steel Officer Uniform' (Not the Underarmor) like a trench coat with the hat, similar to the 'Elder Battlecoat' except it's an actual uniform or even: An 'Off Duty' Underarmor would be nice too. Anything really.

Si eso fue lo que hize, gracias, si tienes xbox añademe, somos pocos los que hablamos español 😢

Oh, goodness! Glad that bug was fixed!

Had something similar happened. I was on Siege being spammed invites by this one guy. He starts messaging me asking why I won’t party up with him. I simply reply that I didn’t go into random parties because 9/10 it’s usually some dickhead yelling at you for nothing. He reported me and I got a one day comms ban. I even rang up Microsoft support where an actual person looked over my message to see he was the harasser in this situation. Although she said she couldn’t appeal or remove the comms ban but I could report him for false reporting.
---
Yeah, i will start to look more for them, ty

I don't think I've ever seen serum plans in my life at a vendor. I heard they drop from SBQ fights but have never gotten one

This is cursed knowledge. I simultaneously love and hate you for this information.

Might as well buy the bundle, you’ll have three months or more before anything cool comes out. Most of the crap they’ve been putting in is just recycled anyway. Free stuff that was already free. YAY, Pride.
---
"My Mom's an out of control Karen" would be a way more intimidating threat than "I know a guy" ever is.
---
Actually yeah, a separate server for PVP would make more sense in my opinion.
---
Does this work if you’re set to pacifist?
---
VATS is bad, but Captainoob just solo'ed the Colossus with it so there is that.  It did way better than the Gauss Minigun IMO.  If they fixed VATS, it would be the best pistol in the game hands down.  I like mine but it is collecting dust until VATS hits properly.  It is great if you aim it though.
---
As for the plasma caster, think of it as the heavy gunner's plasma alternative to the lever action rifle, but with a higher ammo capacity and faster fire rate.  The damage is similar/slightly higher than the lever.  VATS is good and sneak works well with it.
---
It is not about if you like pvp or not, you can easily avoid pvp with the current system if you don't like to pvp in games,  the main problem with pvp is that many things are broken right now like legacies weapons (those weapons are totally broken and they can insta kill you, so if you don't have any of those weapons, you are always at a disadvantage against someone who have one, also you can't get any of them now unless you pay real money to someone so...), nuka colas, magic, etc.
---
Many players are categorized like 'pve players' just because they prefer to stay away from an unfair pvp and they don't want to cheat with those things, either because  they don't have those things or they don't want to use them, so they only pvp with friends with certain rules to make it fair, like nobody can use duped items or legacies, and mostly in private servers.
---
If they fix these problems and balance things, most 'pve players' will become pvp players, because they really like pvp, what they don't like is a totally broken and unfair pvp mess.
---
Do you know how to use capital letters after put a period? Obviously not... so you can excuse this fine person for not doing so,plus nobody asked you for your input so keep it to yourself if you’ve got nothing nice to say.

handmade. It looks better
---
All five of my characters are commando. One bloodied and 4 high health. I use either a fixer of handmade on every one, cannot really tell the difference. If you get an awesome legendary drop use it....
---
They used to drop from the sbq. Way back. Now only for sale at WS bunker. Or if a player has them for sale.
---
I have no clue if there is a list in general that has datamined unused items, but there are various datamines from past patches that includes unused content. A big one I remember was the pioneer scout update datamine, a small few of the backpacks where actually used.
---
Just fyi, I played all bethesda games in spanish till now, bc there's so little info about 76 in my language. So i could never knew that, lol.

Yeah that's understandable. But if this feature could ever be implemented, it would be fantastic!

Sounds like TSE clan shenanigans again

Wait so he was upset you moved a tent to the event or away from it?

EMBRACE DEMOCRACY, OR BE ERADICATED
---
Bro he enjoys the game. You're acting like he's Todd Howard himself.
---
And some team mates are daft! But because 1 person in the squad is daft, or can't aim, or is bloodthirsty - it doesn't mean that everyone in the squad wants to be dragged into it. 
---
I have a guild and have members who won't join squads with others for this reason. Even though they always have Pacifist on. 
---
But Bethesda's way around this is that from patch 20 - each squad member is going to have to initiate PvP with each member of the opposing squad.
---
So if there are 2 squads of 4 fighting each other, each member from squad A has to tag each member from squad B in order to initiate PvP with all of them. 
---
This is what "PvP enthusiasts" are pissed about. 
---
Which brings me back to point 1. Make Pacifist actually work, completely.
---
Lo siento, estoy en la PC. Y solo hablo un poco de español. Te deseo suerte.

When I get annoyed at a weird bug I may take a trip down to watoga.

Let's hope there is a large amount of Brotherhood stuff soon.

Why, yes. Yes I do. Indeed my comment above is, as should be obvious, poking fun at OP, and demonstrating what OP did incorrectly. As OP is no stranger to posting on Reddit, they, by the process of immersion, can be expected to have acquired basic writing skills. Such skills do not exist merely to show that your brain is a functioning organ, but to communicate effectively.
---
Now, concerning your comment. It is true that no one specifically request my input. Likewise, no one specifically requested YOUR input. Yet here we are. So I will provide additional commentary around your comment: That whooshing sound above your head is the plane that carries the entire point I was making. Perhaps if you hurry, you can catch it.

FIX MY TREASURE HUNTER HAT!
---
I like it, but I feel like it needs its own roofs. For instance if your building is three "tiles" wide, you are stuck putting that peak type roof on the middle and it sticks out like a sore thumb.
---
Don't know why they couldn't reskin some of the roofs to at least have the siding where its still wall technically.
---
As someone who just came back, enjoys how much less Gankfesty the game is, but enjoys NW and wants more optional PvP - I really like how much thought you’ve put in. However I have also seen what they did and upon coming back I think at best they’ll do a Raiders vs Settlers team based PvP match games. It really looks like they’ve left open world PvP dead on the shelf at this stage.
---
How did it taste?
---
**ALSO THIS GUY’S TREASURE HUNTER HAT!**
---
Glad you asked.        
---
       
---
PVP has had 3 major attempts at development but all were too far from the point and lacked the harmony required to make something: replayable.     
---
      
---
First was basic Adventure PVP mechanism which exists today. This allowed players to be killed very slowly without consent, used a “duel” system to engage fights, plus workshops. Of the three, I think this was easily the closest to a winning outcome. The problem was there is no competitive attributes to this model, nor incentives to improve at PVP. As mentioned in my OP, Fo76 has so many variables in character build, some fights last minutes, some one second. Because this makes a “fair fight” so difficult to match players, it basically means players need to be careful who they choose to fight, as the range of combat ability spans from very weak- to end game builds that also compete.         
---
Because of the lack of competitive activities actually available (workshops+ ONE pvp event which rarely is active), this has unfortunately drawn the combatant players to HARASS OTHER USERS. This is a terrible outcome and certainly could have been avoided.        
---
If there were more PVP activities: the PVP players would be too busy fighting each other to bother anyone else.       
---
         
---
Second came Survival mode. A shadow server of adventure with higher consequences of death, un-restricted PVP and tougher survival conditions. This is perfect for players looking for a “full hardcore experience.” But for character builds that want to compete? Terrible!    
---
You would lose so many aid items and caps in under 1 hour you would be forced to return to adventure to resupply.     
---
Survival servers were also terribly lonley. Teams if any, were over powered players using tricks to climb the leaderboard and basically own a server.      
---
Survival was a good idea, but what was made from it made no sense to play.     
---
     
---
I may PVP but most of my friends are too terrified to try. And I don’t blame them. You lose more fights than you win when starting, and some players kill you so quick it looks impossible.        
---
Lastly Nuclear Winter:     
---
Imo was a disgrace. After the community rallied hard for a better PVP experience Bethesda gave us: Fortnite Fallout edition.       
---
This is not what we asked for. We asked for Fo76(adventure lets be honest) with better pvp mechanisms. Instead Bethesda used this to try to enter the Merket with a fortnite platform. Disappointing its own PVP base, and fortnite players kept playing fortnite: WOW.      
---
Bethesda has done everything but try to replace the currently TERRIBLE pvp system in adventure with a better form. This will not harm non-pvp players, in fact it will likely be enjoyed because there will be less “assholes trying to fight me.”    
---
WE NEED PVP TEAMS &amp; EVENTS
---
As someone who rarely likes anything the atomic shop has to offer, I'm disappointed at nearly every update. Its mostly a bunch of goofy stuff.
---
Same problem for me :(
---
Are mods allowed? That's one thing that's scared me about mods is the possibility of being banned. I've read very conflicting opinions on mods.
---
Pretty sure 200 messages, in which the player insults and cusses you, classifies as harassment. He needs a nice little ban to teach him some manners.  Not sure if you'd report that to Microsoft or Bethesda, but im a petty SOB so I'd report it to both.
---
Yep goes to prove that your head is far up your own arse that you making it into a joke just proves that your just a child on a keyboard that cant take a story of someone helping another and trying to correct them on their punctuation. My input is in defense of this person and attacking people obviously shows your age with a “joke”. Grow up.
---
Yes. They have pacifist off. So, when you damage them (because they triggered a mutation by attacking you) they can immediately attack you. 
---
My advice, block them and server hop. It sucks that trolls win by doing this, but Bethesda has been aware of this issue for awhile and have done nothing. 
---
Submit a ticket, maybe Bethesda will actually do something or make a statement.
---
Didn’t stick because they want to drain everyone’s money with less overhead costs, less development, and outright lies.
---
Sorry about that. Hope it's not too hard to change &amp; you find something you like even better.
---
SBQ has chance to drop more than just legendaries and you can farm that zone too. 
---
SBQ regularly gives me stable flux (no need to grind raw, HRF, and masses)
---
SBQ will drop radiation decontamination shower too, less regularly but it happens. Other good plans too.
---
White springs is not bad but I prefer SBQ for the rewards and potential to farm as well.
---
I nuked Welch in ash heap a few weeks ago and got a wendigo colossus so hey you never know.
---
There is a statement issued by Bethesda on their page regarding mods. Look it up so you know 100% that you feel comfortable doing this. 
---
Also, at one point Bethesda said they were going to do something similar in game.
---
Edit: I’ve been using this mod and a few others and everything is fine. One skips the intro Bethesda logo, the other is required for the perk manager.
---
Lol tell him ur dad works at epic games and that he'll ban him from fortnite , Shows the alpha
---
Damn aight. Gimme till tomorrow and I'll shoot a private dm
---
FO76 has a fantastic map, perhaps the best of all FPS open-world games. Combat, crafting, CAMPS and leveling/progression are really fun. If it weren't for the bugs and server instability, I'd give FO76 a 10 out of 10.
---
Why sir, your ass is uncovered.
---
I has the impression that there was a forum specifically for hyperactive twelve year olds, whatever are you doing here?
---
People seem to think that every PvPer was interested in Survival Mode. The truth is Survival Mode was more than just an open PvP mode, it had a number of other changes that many players didn't want to bother with.
---
I for one could not stand the limited fast travel. I don't always have all the time in the world to play and I usually don't want to spend it being forced to run long distances doing nothing else. Then there was dropping aid on death, which I know was a contentious change. I personally disagreed with it as well.
---
There were other issues as well, but it all boils down to there being too many changes made that didn't actually coincide with what the majority of the PvP community really wanted. It was a niche mode that was enjoyed by an even smaller minority than the PvP community as a whole.
---
No it doesn't work completely. If I can have Pacifist on and I can still get into PvP because of a squad mate then it doesn't work completely. It doesn't matter this fault it is. 
---
For me personally, I don't care if I get dragged into PvP. I'm not a junk hoarder and I enjoy it. But I know a lot of people who want to avoid it completely.
---
Yes they will be able to join the new Public Squads. But a simpler way is to just make Pacifist work completely, regardless of if you're solo, private or public squad. 
---
We'll see what happens with Patch 20, but from the way they have described the changes, it will completely destroy PvP all together. And there still are players that care about it.
---
Idky that isn't already one of the options.
---
The Devine Light or just Devine Light, The Shrine, The Altar, The Path, The Omen or just Omen, Holy Enlightenment, Holy Harbinger, or Cosmic Cocoon. What platform? I'd love to visit.
---
Not that I disagree, but literally all it takes to stop scams is a minor tweak to player trading. 
---
Player 1 puts x/caps up for trade, player 2 puts y/caps up for trade, then confirm. Trade complete. 
---
But a market system could also be quite useful if implemented correctly.
---
Never go first.
---
Looked it up, it’s been my gmail since 2004.  Bethesda was easy to change atleast.
---
I'm new to the game, but you can decorate someone's camp. Is that like, when you're on a team? I would join your party but I am unavailable to. :(
---
people suck. dont let it ruin the game for you fella. The vast majority of peeps in this game are good folk
---
Well, usually I try to do my daily’s first. Then, I either farm for more mats that I don’t need, or my favorite “ pick a random location and keep walking”. I find that last one is amazing for both killing time and keeping myself in the loop of things
---
lol I got one a while ago but have never used/modded it, can't get used to using cores for ammo and PA.

---
I know that now
---
Never trust anyone in trading unless you personally know them, and maybe be hesitant even then.
---
There are many ways different platforms that have Couriers that will do trades for you. 
---
I feel bad for you, but it's you own fault. Trading in this game is dangerous as it is such a flawed system. Never trust anyone, only do trades if they go first (and you aren't a scammer), get a courier, or just get the stuff yourself. One of the few great things of this game is *most* top tier and rare items can be obtained
---
Again I'm sorry for your loss, it's a step one, but you need to be careful and realize this game is not a friendly trading environment.
---
Warn? Sounds like a blast! Love a good trap base.
---
Just another layer to the game. Why have multiple work benches when you could one that serves all the same purposes? I know it’s not necessary by any means. Just a thought.
---
I'm pretty sure they're voiced by Wes Johnson? You can hear it sometimes when they start, um, expressing a personality. The cowboy protectron in Nuka-World screaming "Mad Mulligan's Mine!" is 100% Wes Johnson.
---
It does if you don't team with fools. Pacifist works as intended. Blaming pacifist for not working correctly because of human error is daft. 
---
If I'm solo and I have pacifist on it works fine. If I'm on a team and they don't get hotheaded I'm fine. 
---
If I'm with teammates who tag then I deserve to be shot for being unprepared. If my teammate doesn't warn me they are tagging then it's their fault not pacifists. 
---
Learn who your teaming with and if they are going to tag. Don't team with randos if you can't trust them. 
---
Once patch 20 drops anyways it won't make any difference. 
---
I'm good on this now. Only so many times I can go around this circle.
---
The other problem (other than server overload) is that perverts (like me) will use it to post porn...
---
Sounds like they want to play trios and decide to just be asshats to the unlucky soul that gets the 4th spot.
---
Best to just remember them and leave if you get them again.
---
It's pretty mind blowing that in a MORPG in 2020 we still dont have a way to safely trade items with strangers.
---
Sorry for your loss.  If i ever see that guy on xbox ill nuke his camp for ya

Hit me up if you see me &amp; want to play together. I use the same name as on here

You’ve just gotta march to your own beat...or waltz...square dance? It’s your beat.
---
Why would you build a Rad-Shower in a workshop? He didn’t jump to your base, there is a zone. If you fast travel too far away, PvP disengages.
---
Shot in the dark but does blueprinting it do anything to save the positions.
---
Wait a few years and then respond with oh ok then
---
I forget to specify that my CAMP (and therefore decontamination shower) is next to that workshop so perhaps not the most subtle of bases...
---
Tactics isn’t canon, but 1 and 2 definitely are.

They come from mire events and are very rare like .5 chance. You can try to buy but itll probably be 10k to 20k each
---
Lol just report a message with anything slightly profanity and they get a comms ban for a couple weeks
---
i think hes worked three times for me.  also my dailies only work sometimes and the ward daily is always completed so i never have to retrieve whatever equipment it is i was supposed to get.
---
Hah! Well the loading screens are photos acquired in game, what kind of porn could you be posting that's in the game?
---
Well, that thought didn't even cross my mind. I'm going to pull them from my vendors. (I have the price set to 50 caps a piece) 
---
But I also have a lot of free ammo. 10mm and I believe .308
---
It’s getting close to the 4th, enjoy the show. They paid for them, win win.
---
I believe that it does.  It's gradual and you only really notice it over 100 levels or so, but I've had points where I've maxed out my CAMP budget and then 50 levels later be able to place more items.
---
When I first started playing, about 18 months ago, my character could barely put down a shack.  Now my level 375+ can build a mansion, in comparison.  Granted, I've learned a lot of techniques to eek out more budget since and perhaps Bethesda has tweaked the budget cost of different items, plus there is always the possibility of bugs, but I'm not sure that this accounts for the difference and I have yet to see proof otherwise.
---
Here's what I will do.  I have a new character that is about to hit level 5.  I plan on leveling him up fairly quickly to level 50.  I'll build a CAMP to max budget at level 5 and not touch it all the way up to level 50.
---
I'll document the Budget usage graph every 10 levels and then again after scrapping and rebuilding the CAMP at level 50 using the same specs.

---
Well, as it is set up currently, the photos that you take in game end up in a file under 'my documents'. You can swap those files out for.... lets just say 'custom images' and end up getting 'fun' loading screens.
---
Also, with the PC version, there is actually a nude mod available for the game. So you could simply take photos of characters using the nude mod and then display it in camp...
---
Not that I would ever do such things, mind you.....
---
That’s crazy 🤦‍♂️
---
Really? Thank you that helps, now I know I should be doing more mire events instead of searching every NPC vendor. I know it’s very rare but it’s better than looking in the wrong place constantly lol.

What is that bed called, the one pictured in the contemporary camp bundle? And where can I get it? Someone please let me know, I really want that bed :&lt;

From what I saw the lack of special sales was only one of many complaints about 1st
---
I haven’t read the whole thing, and I didn’t play when survival existed but this sorta reminds me of the death of survival in Runescape. Not that I ever played that mode either but still.
---
TRRRRROOOOOLLLIIIN (Jim Jones voice)
---
When i said buy i meant from other players. You can usually find people selling it but it wont be cheap
---
Good thing I'm not wasting my Atom's on that bundle.
---
Cheers
---
Thanks man
---
I get them a lot from doing play time
---
I got lucky and got that damn pie on my second try
---
Oh I'm about to do this to this Griefer piece of shit that just stole all my stuff.
---
Haha! Fuck sake man, aye I guess there would be these kind of things on PC. Possibly could put controls in place to try and prevent these kind of things, I'm totally sure you wouldn't be against that though...
---
People get offended at the littlest things nowadays.
---
The first things you mention are exploits and need to be fixed.  The syringer has been fixed already.
---
I don't want to force pvp on someone who doesn't want it, they are not a challenge to fight and I don't like driving people away from the game.  There are griefers of all types in all games, not all pvpers are griefers and this accusation is just tiring at this point.
---
Workshops are pretty much the only places to have possible pvp and it is the reason I take them when I bother to play.  Hunter/hunted doesn't happen, especially when playing during off hours.  I won't touch nuclear winter because on pc it is filled with hackers and for me it is not real pvp of the type I bought this game for.
---
I wish there was a way to put pvp willing people on the same servers, maybe a checkbox before clicking on adventure or something.  Would honestly prefer a modified Survival mode because there is so much more they could do like new faction war quests and rebalance gear and skills just for pvp.
---
I used the claw machine there once, received the pie and thinking I was pretty lucky I went for a weapon instead of the usual legendary modules. Ended up getting a fixer with faster fire rate and I was extremely happy... Until I saw it was a medics. Still one of the best rolls I've ever gotten from mumbles
---
Make sure you go to the top of every lookout tower and survey the area. It will show locations you have not discovered grayed out on your map. To Survey, look out from the top of the tower and you should see a survey area option popup.
---
I assumed that’s what you meant, I just couldn’t find any information on the actual plans so I was scraping and searching every NPC vendor I could think of with no luck so your info helps a lot. I don’t mind paying caps, I’m lvl 300 so I don’t really need them for anything else.
---
I got a 2-star Vanguard's Robot Right Leg to replace the Nocturnal Combat Right Leg I was using after getting the pie.
---
I absolutely wish they focussed on perk load outs and making the whole perk system more user friendly before they complicate it with legendary perks
---
Usually custom for lower karma to go first and trust you, and vice versa. Xbox wasteland strangers, random trades are the most dangerous though. When I feel weird, I grab a middle man. If the person is uncomfortable with it, It's not worth the trade.
---
The claw machine reveals all through the pie in accordance with the prophecy

(Edit; holy shit is that Laura Palmers Mother?)
---
Ah, thanks!
---
The decontamination shower plan is a set drop from first kill.
---
After you have the ultriacite armor and receiver plans there's not much besides set flux drops. 
---
And quite frankly the bog sucks for flux, and fuilds and mass's, whitesprings Morgan town and elsewhwere are actually much better, and as for legendary more mobs spawn in other locations at faster rate.
---
So it breaks down to loot type your looking for is where you nuke.
---
PS4
---
In her defense, I am sending them all to Foundation behind her back...
---
Just curious, but did you check the blacklist first? Always a good idea before doing a trade...
---
I haven’t been doing many mire events because I didn’t know there was other rare drops other than the leather coat but I will definitely start now that I know
---
Am I missing something here?
---
5 years later i may get my fish mailbox
---
That could be interesting, especially with different modes.  I was working on an arena with "audience participation" at my alt's base but don't really bother to log in anymore.
---
Middle man has to be trusted by both parties otherwise I wouldn't accept this trade either. 
---
You could easily have a friend pose as the middle man and steal the item. If you're savvy enough about it, the middle man can steal both items, which gets you off the hook and that middle man can give you both items back later when no one is around.
---
keep rads til you're under 20% and you're fine
---
You’ll likely get a many different answers as there are nukes :) 
---
Toxic Valley.  
---
Tons of violet flux and a change of pace from the usual nuke zone enemies.
---
All you can really do is feel sorry for someone like that.
---
yep, I feel dumb. I just have like 4 weapons that start with A and it blended in
---
Maybe your fallout buddy isn't really your buddy...
---
So player trading like in pretty much every other multiplayer game I have played, no clue why Bethesda didn't have this at the start.  Would love a market though, could make it where you pay less if you visit the camp to buy the item so people don't cry about no one going to their camps anymore.
---
Agreed.
---
I was told I had to let ATHENA transfer to the assaultron and that would shut her up about the headaches because ATHENA is also her or something like that. Was I lied to?
---
Edit: to clarify, I've already completed her quest and didn't go the assaultron route, so I no longer have the option of trying it out myself to find out the truth unless I recruit her through my secondary character, and I'm just not really in the mood to go through that whole quest line again, so...
---
She’s trash, ugly, and won’t shut up. Livin with Gramps and it’s way, way better,
---
It's a major award!
---
I am not sure if I am remembering this right, but I think I remember having to go to a train station and basically just reading all the posters on the wall.
---
A thread about the pie? 
---
You know someone will say it.
---
What is this ambassador program?? Never heard of this... ???
---
Hmmm hmmm hmmm I JuSt LoVE SoNGs Don'T YoU
---
God I hate that so much and I don't even have it I'm glad I don't 
---
Ho ho ho Oh No ThiS Is TerAbLe ChEeR LeVels DropInG To CatAstRoPhiC LeVeLs... ReBoOtInG CoMplEtE Ho hO Ho
---
100 tries is too small of a sample. You need at least 1000 for this kind of stuff.
---
Upvoted u to,wil keep this in mind next time ✌🏻
---
I thought it was scheduled for the 24rd or maybe the 25st. 26nd even?
---
Sorry bud. What you intend and what actually happens rarely align. You might want to be helping out noobs with low prices but there's nothing stopping a high level person from nabbing them at all.
---
It's really on your to only stock a small supply at a time to minimise loses to high level players or trade directly with these low levels so you're guaranteed to get stuff to the people you want to. The market can be brutal like that, sadly.
---
I built a stage at one of my character's camps with like 7 instruments. I've only ever been able to have three going at once with a roaming trader, settler wanderer, and myself. 
---
it would be awesome to have it poppin'.

---
Dead? Not yet.
---
Honestly them fixing it sucked for me, watoga was a good source of fun, combat and scrap for me. Now I could fight them, but they one shot.
---
A friend of mine put the white “shag” in his camp and I hadn’t seen it before. I asked when the granite floors were in the atom shop.
---
If you arent on ps4 i can send you pictures
---
I really couldn't agree with all of this more. I've been trying to say a lot of the same things. 
---
What I agree with most of that the devs should stop listening to all the players that have zero stake or interest in PvP. The PvP community has far better ideas for PvP than the PvE community does (considering their only ideas seem to consist of removing PvP entirely or delegating it to a separate mode).
---
Something around the same happened to me but these group of like 6-7 dipshits mass reported my account and got my reputation to “needs work”
---
How many of those pieces were 1 2 and 3 stars and how many had ap regen?
---
Also poisoners isn’t a primary, was it hunters or zealots?
---
Just wanted to take a moment to laugh at the people who downvote and don’t comment-bitches.
---
You can find a decent black one up by Freak Show.
---
The atom shop jet packs are not skins. You will have to craft them new. You will still need to know the plans for jet packs. But you can’t craft a generic one and then apply a skin. So if you already have a jet pack you’ll have to craft a new one so save your flux.
---
Aw man, that really sucks. I hope they patch this because I did not even know that such a thing was possible. If they do, I might have to put in the Final Fantasy 6 theme song to play on repeat at my camp.
---
Ha I call her Murmur and she loves me everytime I go she gives me 3* bloodied weapons ie my BE .50 cal
---
No thats ridiculous, they didn’t have to expand the map for encrypted, vault raids or even WASTELANDERS. But adding mechanics sees to need a bigger map you think.      
---
Point dismissed.
---
I need pictures
---
I am longing for that display case.
---
Exactly. Every other well done player trading system  have that feature as standard. 
---
And I think for a market system to work, it would have to be limited to just weapons and armor. You could put your item for sell in a public vending machine for either a set price of caps or up to 3 items for trade. Although, a significant increase to the cap limit would be necessary, as most players would want to sale their high value items here and leave the rest at their camp. I feel that provides a good balance for market vs camp vending.
---
Call it what you want to call it, but I'm just telling you what players want man. 
---
Enjoy your adventures in Appalachia!
---
I think I know exactly where your base is cause that's where my base is.
---
Gotya
---
That sounds more kinky than shameful....
---
And to think I was hyped for today only to find the atomic shop was a bust 😠😡
---
OP, if you got your wish from the very beginning and were able to choose exactly the legendary effects you wanted, do you think you'd still be playing the game, rather that realising much sooner that there is no depth to the game and the end game is meaningless, especially now that you've removed the terrible grind aspect to it?
---
See, that's what Bethesda does to suck people into playing the game longer than they probably should have. It's smart that you realised (eventually) that it's just not worth it.
---
Good for you for putting your money where your mouth is and discontinuing the sub. If more people do so if they're dissatisfied with the game back like a little while ago when people were dissatisfied with the vendor/display case issue, you watch how quick and responsive Bethesda can be.
---
Bethesda is solely driven by money. Not pride in the quality of work they do. Not by their satisfaction of their vision. Not by how happy their customers are playing their game. Just straight up cash is all they care about.
---
They could have a player approval rate of less than 5% but if the money keeps coming in, that's all they care about. That's as clear as day based on what they've demonstrated to date.
---
If it's SOOOOOOO infuriating to you you always have the nuclear option....
---
Simply move your camp to a different spot and start over
---
Every single time I log in or out it's only wasterlander weps though plasma casters and guass mini s
---
Because you assume that all pvp players like survival.
---
I have one of those, I was just wanting the American flag one cause my character wears the stalker gear and it would look really good with it. I'm sure they will put it back in the store at some point, im just impatient hahaha.
---
Oh no, dismissed by an internet douche. How ever will I go on?
---
Damn no unyielding? This looks like my luck
---
Who are you kidding. We don't even get what we need.
---
perhaps the wendigo has a timer ? dataminers probably have the information ....
---
I don’t care where you go, but your point isn’t staying here.
---
I started on Xbox during the free play weekend, and did not notice any such pop up.   Maybe it depends on your platform?  Or they changed it?  Or glitch?
---
LIBERTY LIBERTY LIBERTY LIBERTY LIBERTY LIBERTY
---
 I say no, not worth it these days because crippling perks don't work on the queen which means you can't force her to land. It's one of the main reasons I have not logged on in weeks.
---
Nothing has been said one way or the other so who knows.
---
Given Bethesda's track record, it would be too much to assume that it'll be available because they didn't otherwise indicate that it won't be.
---
I know a guy.
---
Several.
---
👍
---
Also this item is free until 7/7 so maybe/probably no free item next week.
---
That makes zero sense.
---
I'd have totally bought that revolver skin for -50% off, but I don't have F1st and never have any intention of getting it.
---
Next week prob
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wes_Johnson
---
the wiki agrees with you
---
To be fair I only play PC but it'd be VERY unusual that it's not brought up.
---
It's a full screen popup as soon as you reach level 5 that you have to press a button to skip.
---
You might have skipped it without properly reading it but it's unmissable.
---
No way to know unfortunately. Just keep an eye on atom shop weekly updates.
---
Multiple workbenches makes far more sense from a gameplay perspective. 
---
First, it helps add a layer of organization. Can you imagine how clunky it would likely be trying to cram each category of item crafting and repair into one menu? Maybe a better dev team could do it but not with Bethesdas hot trash UI skills.
---
Next it makes it so the devs can place workbenches with specific functions in specific areas. This game was originally supposed to be a survival-lite game so not having everything at your fingertips at once is part of the gameplay. Seeking out specific benches while you were traveling was/is supposed to be part of the experience.
---
Your idea as presented doesn't serve any purpose that isn't already being served by another item. I'm not explicitly against your idea, I just think there needs to be more thought put in for it to make sense.
---
I have a Junkie's Fancy Revolver that's good for trash mobs, and only trash mobs.
---
It's not new stuff, but I really wanted that American flag set.
---
It's been a known issue that ballistic bock doesn't boost heavy weapons. It's a shame because my junky heavy gunner sure loves beer.
---
The bloodied builds are gonna be so pissed
---
You're right but this is left over from when Bethesda was pushing people hard into PvP before they came to their senses and realised that the majority of their player base don't ever want to engage in PvP.
---
Ok thanks
---
Done the opposite for me.   Running the same events over and over again just to get bullion and scrip for the armour is too depressing and tedious so I haven't been playing lately.  Only have the chest and the jet pack learned because of this.  Lost count of how many chest pieces I have made and only one is somewhat useful and certainly not as good as my current chest piece.  Got rid of a lot of things others might have liked though.   If we could trade only with others who have learned the plans the grinding would still be tedious and depressing for me but at least there would be a possibility of getting something decent that might keep me playing.
---
Quick question, do you know if High Voltage Heff boosts heavy weapons?
---
I imagine a dataminer might have some insight as to how the odds are handled.
---
It doesn't look great but at the same time, it's not exactly a large sample.
---
Pretty much this! I wouldn't mind if in the future they add Cross Play between PS4,XB1,PS5, and XB1SX but PC can stay away.
---
She’s a twat and a scam artist through and through. You’re objectively wrong in liking her.
---
Decent on Cobalt flux too, iirc
---
This. Honestly more excited to scrap cards than I am to get legendary perks.
---
Another thing is delayed? Wtf do they even post dates?!?!
---
The golden .50 cal doesn’t show in my atom shop. Does it rotate?
---
I know right?
---
I'm of the philosophy that if you're going to get a good piece you'll roll it after only a few rolls. When I roll something if it isn't giving me anything I at all want I stop after about six or seven tries. I'll wait a few days and collect some more modules before I try again... That is unless I get at least two good drops from the world... Then I'll give myself another couple of rolls. It actually worked once when some legendaries dropped me two bloodied weapons. I rolled a couple of plasma casters afterwards and sure enough I snagged myself a bloodied one after three rolls.
---
2-3 at most, no matter the location. 7 in one place is just insane.
---
Build a floor on the wall, connect a stair to it, and a foundation at the base of the stair. This should correct the error if it is connected to the rest of your structure. You could also try building another wall under it until it touches your foundation. The game acts funny if you take apart some structure pieces out of order.
---
*This is why Beckett is better.*
---
Well apparently you aren't on the exclusive list for the super-secret Bethesda Atom Shop schedule like the rest of us are, and you want us to give away our super-secret information. We had to do a lot of questionable things to get on this conspiratorial internal mailing list, and you expect to just get a handout 🙄
---
One does not simply *give out* the information known only to the hive mind.
---
Fair enough, it's a good set
---
Who needs their ass kicked.
---
Anti armor fire rate is your best bet. Ammo may be a bit harder to scrounge up, but the damage will be great.
---
How can we have so many power armor skins and like half a dozen skins across all weapons. Some weapons don’t even have skins but there’s a dozen power armor skins at any time. I don’t get why it is so lopsided.
---
You can. You just have to post a link to it.
---
It's probably to keep the feed as meme-free and low effort post as possible given that's what a lot of the images will be.
---
Lol there is no one more entitled and petty than a Battlefield plane main.
---
What are in the bundles?
---
*hisses in bloodied build*
---
This one??
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429
---
They say they dont support it and it can break your game but they never say if you'll get banned. They're actually pretty vague about the use of mods.
---
Not sure why you're downvoted, you're absolutely correct.
---
The AA.. It'll have better DPS and durability and you can use it in close quarters. The other one would be an alright gun to use for Encrypted and the Silo's, though you'll have to be careful in the narrow areas.
---
I grew tired this long before she became my ally by constantly hearing her say this while visiting other people's camps.
---
Well it's the 2 sides the Devs and the corp, problem is corp has final say, but dev actually do the work and would like to do a good job are hobbled by corp forcing them them use cost effective tool like the  broken buggy godmode dammge bug that's 6 month old , dupes since launch, account hacks for years 10 year old exploits and bugs still not fixed gamebro engine. 
---
But ya corp side is scum sucking fucktards who don't see the customer base as human to keep milking it the way they do.
---
We're being nice.
---
Report him so he stops doing it to others and a bit of irony
---
Survival tents probably
---
&gt;Why are people so against PVP in adventure? It has almost always been optional.
---
That's the biggest lie right there.
---
If it TRULY were optional, it'd be a non-issue. However, there are too many ways that people have been forced or exploited into PvP such that Bethesda has had to deal with the issues several times, with the most recent coming up where 1 person in a team can't force the whole team into PvP.
---
That doesn't even factor in the ways the game still to this day forces the potential of PvP onto you with workshops and the Monster Mash even being forced PvP areas.
---
Hell, once you reach level 5, you're forced into PvP mode. You have to explicitly turn it off in your settings.
---
Sorry bud. Griefers ruining PvP for everyone. Just the fact of the matter. Maybe even you're one of the griefers given how you've responded in this post.
---
With enough grinding any game like this becomes super easy eventually. I recently got a survival game of Fallout 4 on go for when I want more of a challenge.
---
If I didn't see those reduced tags, I'd probably have no cosmetics at all
---
No. They have to rebalance builds, and/or reduce hp pool of enemies in levels 25/50 first.
---
agree the game is way too easy.. even combat wise. might be a bit bulletspongy, but its entirely possible to go through the entire game without a single damage perk card equipped and not die. in the start its kinda rough because you simply havent gotten anything yet. but around already level 10-15 its a cakewalk.  
---
increasing every difficulty factor by 100% would still be easy. its always been the case with fallout though.   
---
everyone is so high on bloodied builds, but i personally find it too squishy. i have 3 different builds in 100+ and they all take care of high level enemies just fine. even the wendigo colossus solo on all of them.
---
Same with the Raider Punk tbh
---
Or go make a server where it mandatory PvP for you and you can go get your ass ganked by exploits every 2 mins. Explosive revenge God mode anybody?
---
PvP only works if you can provide a level playing feild and at no point can Bethesda do that with the current game.
---
&gt;it calls out "there are bugs with this data, especially with the drop chances"
---
That's just a message on every page on that site about event drop chances and other stuff it doesn't really matter here.
---
&gt; I looked at it and I don't see the RNG portion of the code 
---
You can see that every effect is listed equally, none of them have special conditions or differ from one another. Whatever pulls from that list does it without favoring any of the effects.
---
Your sample is nice but it's too small. When trying to match expected values with results you need a really big sample like 1000 or 10000 tries. Look up the Law of Large Numbers if you are interested in the subject.
---
Depending on the issue (I think there's at least two, since I often have to fix stuff like that and neither always works), exiting the game completely will resolve incidents where a component has been deleted well enough to be invisible and not a barrier to movement will either reappear to be properly deleted, or actually be gone.  Otherwise the trick someone else suggested with building things snapped back to it and trying to take it back apart typically works, but can feel tedious.
---
If it's really frustrating you, set your CAMP down in the same spot like you were moving.  The gliched walls/roofs/whatever will end up in blueprints/storage with everything else.
---
Hey, Tod never said people who exited Vault 76 on reclamation day would be stupid. Am I wrong? I bet Vault Tec messed up on the enrollment and put some idiots in the Vault on accident. or on purpose. Hey, that might be why we were given access to have nukes? so we can weed out the stupid and rebuild america without dumb people fucking it up again! but hey, that's just a Theory! So that guy threatening you prolly was a mistake in the enrollment. cause who is that dumb to complain about putting your camp somewhere? I have mine at Vault 51, so I don't have to deal with your problem, but I feel you fellow 76 dweller.
---
Either god tier OP builds or hacked weapons.
---
I imagine they using the excuse that you don't get a discount for bundles in real stores just because you own or have purchased one or more of the items in the bundle, even from the same store.
---
Doesn't happen then, so why should it happen here too?
---
6 @ Westek. Though mostly rubbish.
---
It's a pretty typical business practice on ANY products that are sold in a bundle.
---
...magic attributes?
---
No it's a very loud vocal minority that wouldn't want to play what they are actually crying for due to the sheer fact 5 mins after it started it'd be hacked and exploited to fuck with the holes in the game.
---
They then be bitching and crying that there precious PvP wasn't secure.
---
I’m down I’ve been looking for that which there is no of
---
JUST STOP
---
9 during Monster Mash at Watoga HS
---
So all I need to do is wait until I get a great roll of Uny, ap Regen, Cav or fall damage reduction then make myself some SS pieces. Sounds easy enough. Hopefully I have the set I want in two days doing this 😂 if only it were so easy to get those effects in a world drop lol... Oh well I just hope day in and out that I do manage it at some point in my lifetime haha
---
^^, my apologies to the OP but I can’t help it, survival tents are great for SBQ events
---
Honestly soloing that event is great, lots of free exp and legendary
---
Yeah. I started playing Fallout 4 Horizon mode last week, leaving my friends in 76.
---
The mod is amazing, I can barely survive.
---
Very true. I genuinely enjoyed the exploration and finding the little untold stories but the lack of depth became apparent pretty quickly. I just was too prideful to admit it. I should have seen it when my pre ordered, official, game guide had completely incorrect information from launch. It took me way too long but I got there. I may still play with my son from time to time, but not putting another penny into it.
---
downvotes and no comment nice
---
Yep if someone reports a message I’m guessing there’s an automated system that checks for swears and issues the ban first. 
---
Once called someone a little bitch, was com banned within the hour. That’s when I was introduced to how you’re not allowed to trash talk on Xbox anymore.
---
If anyone sees me mangaki86, I would gladly accept some items. Thank you.
---
&gt; I do believe your luck special points affect it.
---
Oh, is that what it is?
---
Got told 'Riding Shotgun' was a good quest to farm for legendaries. I played through it for the first time last night and never saw a single one.
---
Try a berzerkers hvy, pistol or melee build. Try solo the queen without exploits or dying. Good luck with that..... Lmao. Similar to junkies build dmg but way less resistance. Better have those stimpaks/nukas ready. Lol.
---
Bethesda support told me I didn't do enough damage. I guess not enough damage during the 50+ times I exhausted all of my ammo.
---
Reduce? Why?
---
Was this solo or?
---
Today I got 10 legendaries at Project Paradise, not counting the Alpha Predator.
---
It was nice since yesterday I did 4 Monster Mash and 3 of them had 0 legendaries.
---
It was quite the wild west of racism and hate.
---
Civilization has come and the cowboys are dying out for sure.
---
Solo or?
---
It can also be assassin or chameleon . Weird how this one works as I’ve seen other armors with PR but they have the correct prefix
---
This is going to be very difficult to do as you need to police it in such a way that you control EVERYTHING to make it fair.
---
Here are some very basic logically questions you need to have a proper answer for to even be a workable event:
---
* Do you have access to a private server to control access to the match? If so is your tournament suitable for a max of 8 players (including you and any support staff required)?
---
* What's your plan in terms of what weapons, armour, items, perk cards etc. that'll be allowed in the game and what's not? Will you allow for legendaries? Legacy weapons?
---
* How will you control the PvP "arena"? Where is this "arena" and how big is it? How will you know if people go out of bounds?
---
* What anti-cheat measures will you put into place to ensure people follow the rules? How will you be able to control whether or not people follow the rules (especially with restricted items not allowed either being picked up secretly from a stash or dropped in a pre-designated area?
---
* How many support staff will you need to properly run this to ensure that everything is on the level?
---
Whatever your answers, I'd do at least a few dry runs without prizes first to see how it plays out and how to avoid a lot of the issues that could allow someone to cheat their way to the prize.
---
Solo for Monster Mash. With 1 other player for PP.
---
Honestly I just wish they’d stop trying to give us the shitty suit or pyjamas variants. Still crossing my fingers for some cool ass backpack skins, just want a huge hiking bag or satchel :(
---
****Khazukan Kazakit-ha****
---
Morgantown FTW! I kill it for flux and mats every time compared to Whitesprings except one type of flux in MT isn't as common I forget which one though...
---
It's funny that you say that. While I agree with you, there are far too many players that complain about how hard this game is, which surprises me to no end.
---
The game is in desperate need of a combat balance pass, top to bottom. Given the reports to date, sadly I don't think One Appalachia will be enough.
---
I dropped the game in mid 2019 and came back to it a day after the contemporary set left the shop, and I was hoping they'd bring it back in like November or December. As soon as I heard it was back today I rushed to buy it, and I didn't even realize I'd get the brick wallpapers, curtains and cherry flooring in the process. It was a pain in the ass swapping out all my brick walls (especially the double sided interior walls that were up against a 2x1 staircase; that was a fucking battle) but man it was worth it in the end. I'm still deciding on if I want to use the porch pieces, though. I've got a custom made porch front and rear right now that I put a lot of work into designing.
---
I have to be honest, though, the curtains really disappointed me. They take up an assload of the budget and, more importantly, they're the pickiest items I've ever used when it comes to intersecting (even the rug trick doesn't work). I wish they didn't have any collision at all, because there are multiple windows on my house that I just cannot put curtains on due to preexisting furniture.
---
I like the fact that I can jump into a public event at any time and have a blast with other players then afterwards go do my own thing
---
The Atmoic Shop was and remains a total hot mess. Pushing aside complaints about the pricing or its very existence, they just don't advertize items on there with any modicum of competence. Not every bundle lists a bundle exclusive item as such, like with the new Mothman bundle. You have to suss it out yourself by cross checking it with items in the bundle that you can buy separately or it's most likely listed on their site's weekly update. In fact, there are quite a few discrepancies between what's in the store and what's listed in their updates. Like they have the littlest communication within the company even at a management level.
---
And the image examples. My God, the images. They are such trash in how they fail miserably at many times to showcase items. For example, the Floater Chimes that left earlier this month. I had assumed that they were faceless effigy like representations of the floaters. Like an old school child's doll or a something belonging to some backwater witch's hut. I had no idea of the level of detail they had. Textured bumps on its body and a face full of teeth. And yes, you can preview camp items now, but with a red hue obscuring it. And depending on where it's placed, it can be very annoying to try any get a good look at it still. I feel like there's the devs that make items and someone else takes the pics without any passion involved because they didn't make it, and then they just throw it against the wall that is the Atomic Shop.
---
Oh, and anyone else notice the pinkish-purple light casting on the first image of the Mothman Jet Pack and the returning Patriot Underarmor? Not only is it practically false advertizing for the Mothman Jet Pack since it's the cutout image that's just supposed to represent the item as is and because it looks very similar to the pink color of the new Mothman icon, but it's also the same color as the weird pinkish-purple lighting glitch that happens sometimes when you load into 76. So, to sum it up. The person taking the showcase images for the Atomic Shop encountered a lighting glitch when taking the images. Said to himself, "That looks cool!" and threw them on the Atmoic Shop as an official representation of what they're selling us.
---
*Drops the fucking mic.
---
Great questions! And a good starting point for me to brainstorm if it’s possible. Thank you! If I come up with some answers hopefully you don’t mind me getting back to you too see what you think
---
It would be 12/hr over all those purifiers. Extra purifiers simply add storage not speed
---
Edit: spelling
---
I'm literally only playing Nuclear Winter for the rewards and lore. I hate PVP. I never used the PVP servers when they were up because it wasn't my thing. I think they need to go back to PVP servers to get rid of all the PVPers...
---
Better that you learned this now than never.
---
I learned this lesson myself back with Fallout 4 and it's saved me a ton of money, disappointment and time. 
---
Bethesda is never to be trusted with your money and time upfront without clear evidence that they are able to deliver. They didn't burn me on Fallout 76 as I got the game on a massive discount and knew what I was getting myself into. It'll be exactly the same with Starfield, Elder Scrolls VI and all future BGS games.
---
Bethesda has shown who they are as a company. It's up to people like us never to forget that.
---
I miss the days when they would attack on sight.  Made Watoga a challenge...and great for farming materials.
---
This tells me, whether the chance a legendary is assigned to an enemy is based off a combination of people or off one person.
---
Assigned to a legendary- I've killed a super mutant which turned into a legendary straight after I killed it.
---
Didn't get the legendary piece but.
---
I get pretty much everything in the bog except for Raw Cobalt Flux. You can always let Scorchbeasts dunk on you to farm some Scorched for HRF, masses. Noone else mentioned the available Stable Flux from SBQ so I was trying to let OP know it's a thing. I had no idea it dropped for longest time, I used to ignore the queen.  Is there anything else in the game that drops Stable flux? You can buy Stable from vendors.  I've been getting Stable Crimson from SBQ pretty regularly which helps in crafting Marsupial and keeps me from having to hunt down more HRF, masses. As long as there are people showing up in the bog, it's paltry investment (some plasma cores) for a high return, IMO.
---
All the free stuff I've already purchased or grinded for..like every free thing. Please give us old timers new stuff, if I'm at level 200 I pretty much have everything already. Hopefully the new challenge format and upcoming summer changes will provide new stufg
---
Pandaing for support for your clan.... smh :)
---
Damn im on xbox.
---
You know the game is broken when...
---
Im not into the queen much anymore, now I'm nuking different pet spawns trying to get an OP pet.
---
If you’re on ps4 you’re welcome to join :)
---
The camera every time i log off
---
How do you manage this without it getting nuked to oblivion every time?
---
Thats because alot of weapons are broken to the point of being OP. hopefully once they fix the weapons issues and rebalance the enemies it will turn out better.
---
Same, don't understand why there are so may people saying it's too hard.
---
I can't prove it, but I'm going to do some tests over the next few days with max luck points.
---
Usually the nuke zone is a little bit further down so usually I’m safe already had it get nuked 1x today and I just moved it there today but also Thank god my house wouldn’t spawn
---
How do you not understand what I said. I told you as clear as day light that I don’t care to bicker with you, but only cared to prove your point wrong.     
---
Have a nice day.
---
Wait what does scrapping them let you do?
---
I think like 5 or so in and outside westtek. Junk tho.
---
The other places give Flux components and more legendary enemies. Personally bombing anything but prime is more lucrative in both short and long term than SBQ
---
ゴゴゴゴ
---
A lot of is now the PvP revenge God mode exploit leaked wide so every Rando is trying to start PvP to glitching God mode.
---
He was my first companion. I put him in fishing gear as it seemed fitting. Holy fuck he never shut the doors. He told the same pull my finger and tension joke. I kicked his ass out after a week. I just want weasel or the insult bot as a companion. Actually bring back codsworth.
---
It’s supposed to net you points for buying legendary perk cards, like scrapping cards in Nuclear Winter. I have so many redundant cards cluttering up my deck though that I’d be glad for any system that lets me get rid of them, regardless of what I get in exchange.
---
Not true as explained in my post, as per users choosing their fights wisely because there is huge differences between the ability of a non-pvp build and a PVP build. I HAVE to use 9 points on commando perk to have a fight, if I put my favourite crafting perks on I get killed quickly and kill slowly.      
---
And exploits are not intended to be in the game, and should always be removed.
---
Yeah. Public server, I was the only one there
---
Fill your health up. As a full hp character all i get is stupid unyielding. 🙁
---
Ive only been playing since the free weekend, so everything is pretty new to me. Also as a result I only have 1250 atoms, but I have already earned and spend quite a few.
---
Dude... this happened so many times on Battlefield lmao. Had a guy one time try to tell me I was "hacking" because he didn't know how to clear a corner and kept getting smoked on Operation Locker of all places. Says he knows Lars Whoever-The-Fuck at DICE and was gonna have my account reset. Safe to say, it never happened, but it still cracks me up to this day. 
---
That whole mentality is comical. Like I'm gonna plead with you to not report me for "hacking" on fuckin Xbox. Total troglodytes.
---
Nice to see others are building bunkers in Watoga. Just put the final touches on mine tonight, and it’s amazing.
---
I had this decision made for me as a stealth rifleman--I never even saw a worthwhile Fixer drop despite having the plans etc and landed a pretty solid Handmade from a player vendor for only 6k. It's true if you manually aim there's very little climb at all round after round.
---
Plus it comes in black (with atoms). It's slimming.
---
I had a feeling they might be like that after seeing them in other CAMPs. Seems the answer is to place them first in an empty room?
---
Besides exploits, Wanted, being on a team with a player in combat, and workshops:      
---
You can not be forced to PVP.      
---
Workshops is a fair system and so is a wanted level most agree.      
---
I agree the team combat settings are poor and need to be replaced.       
---
And exploits are not intended to be in the game.
---
i found the large green tent but all i found was the [helmet](https://imgur.com/a/y7Zr5a0)(regular fireman's helmet) but not the firebreather outfit or helmet. is this the right location?
---
I can't figure out how much of this was serious.
---
I don't mind bickering with dicks. And you proved nothing except that pvprs are indeed dicks.
---
Got a sales call from a guy in India.   I politely declined his sales pitch. But then we started talking out life in India and he asked if I knew Bill Gates since, at that time, I lived very close to Microsoft headquarters.   Nope, but his car was once parked in front of my job.   It was part luxury sedan, part tank.   It’s a small world if you stop to make friends.
---
This got the shit out of me. I’m going to bed. Well done lol.
---
Soooooo many movie/TV references in this game! I’m constantly finding new ones.
---
lol Downvotes when the game is being quoted.
---
i would really love to get that globe i have seen it in ppls camps and i thought it looked cool. but i dont want anything else in the pack, and i think i should save all my atoms for when i have to catch up on the new thing they are launching soonish. i just know im going to get really behind when i start working again and ill have to use atoms to catch up
---
1 loadouts are coming or can already be added in from nexus. It a godsend. Invalidates you load out argument. Take 5 secs to swap on the fly. 
---
2 Bethesda CAN'T PATCH THE HOLES, there base code of the engine they can't fix or they would of already. They can't provide a level playing feild for PvP as such pvp will never work. The same competive  drive for PvP make sure people will do what ever they can get away with to win. 
---
BTW I was responding to fruitfuckfaces care bear comment originally, not to your op.
---
I need to revisit- maybe it’s been changed. :(
---
lol All they have to do is leave the event.
---
Yeah, but the problem is that even once they're placed, you can't get furniture very close to them. As soon as something touches them, the game throws a fit and says an item is intersecting. I've got a chemistry workbench in the corner of my kitchen that needs to be against the walls - both for aesthetics and because it's the only way it'll fit - and no matter how hard I tried, the two just wouldn't work together. So now on that wall, I've got one window with a curtain and one without. It's driving me nuts and I'll probably end up removing the curtains altogether, especially if I think of something else to build and need to free up some budget.
---
The bundle is still 100% worth it and the curtains are still nice, but they definitely disappointed me.
---
They should slide this in the Atom shop around Christmas.
---
I’m just trying to get PVP supported for the people who want it. 
---
I don’t really know why you are here, when you can’t even give a good reason against the motion.       
---
Is this entertaining you?
---
Does that work on console?
---
2 handed is superior, and if you are not using power armor use unarmed.
---
Or, just doesn’t have any turrets. They take up way too much budget and don’t really do anything to help.
---
Most people likely have it because you could get it for free for a small period time because of a glitch. Same with the deathclaw topiary.
---
Thanks for letting us all know. I'm sure I'll sleep better tonight knowing you'll sleep better tonight.
---
Your commitment is commendable, I been trying build your my unyielding SS with WR perk. 2/5 let’s go, honestly if it wasn’t for the daily limit I would be more incentive to do more rolls per day
---
Yes. They have gone on to explain in video interviews that they intended to have mod support, but with the ‘rough’ launch, they have held off implementing it. 
---
I’ve been using this mod for awhile now, and if it was banned, I’d probably quit the game. It’s made that much of a difference. 
---
I have been trying link the roadmaps and inside the vault articles, but... typical Bethesda, it keeps freezing. 
---
No mods are allowed at all in NW.
---
:D
---
I'm a newish player who spends too much money on atoms. 
---
I disagree soo much.
---
I'm really pissed just last week the floor plans included in that bundle were advertised hard and sold separately.
---
So now I've spent 600 atoms on floors, and now they're included with this bundle?
---
I've been playing about a month now but this ain't the first shady shit I've seen.
---
Oh the space plan includes a a cute toy, the other has the alien. 
---
Nope you cant buy those separate but you sure as shit can buy any other component out of a pack like a poster separately.
---
End rant.
---
I like the content but they're ripping us off with the atom store.
---
It isn't even in the datamines...
---
My main gripe is pvp mindset when comes to balancing weapons and gear when it should have been pve balanced. Handmade magazine nerf for instance. Standard unique clothing no longer giving special stats and head wear not having armor to make it so rpers and pvpers didn't have to change their aesthetic build.
---
Days of carrying specific clothes to counter our weaknesses gone for do you like what you're wearing and are you balanced? Can it give an advantage? Instead of making hats toggle on or off visually over head armor we get no head protection.
---
Meanwhile legendaries and mutations throw all that out anyways.
---
Really???? If that actually worked...I’d be hitting the decon shower all the time before my crafting sessions!! Lol 😂😂😂
---
Well as an xbox player I’ll firstly say:      
---
PC Players are 1/3 of users on the game, with added benefits on this platform comes increased risks such as viruses and hacking, as you seem well aware.     
---
This is an Issue most games have, modding hacking and exploiting are unintended features of the game and should always be removed.    
---
You cant level the field in this game, builds are too complicated. Players who wish to PVP must choose fights carefully, a bit like IRL.     
---
    
---
So you actually hate exploiters of the game, but are attacking people who want fair PVP?
---
A display case like the Thanksgiving case should just be a normal in game plan. Maybe not as fancy, or whatever. Current display limits are weak AF. They give us a bar, but no way to put up the booze. They know what a bar looks like, as most of the code in this game was written in one.
---
And with some of the other posts I've seen with pictures of the locations in real life, makes me want to go see them in person too. Shame they canceled the mothman festival this year, I was looking forward to going.
---
Thanks, I think Ill do it! can they be installed through vortex or do I need to manually install them? Do you recommend any other mods? Specifically lighting or textures?
---
Also I messed around with my build a bit more and was wondering if you wouldnt mind taking a look at it.

I use the CSS and Escape Artist, only time I get the "Danger" is when I'm directly in front of the enemy or molerats underground.

I've literally never been able to play it because no one joins. I'll only try to join just out of curiosity if I see someone else trying to start it but it never goes anywhere.

The AA.

*Space Core loved that*
---
Did my first run a couple days ago. Respawning at the very start on death drove me insane because I kept getting lost trying to find my way back. Then the final section bugged out and I had to quit and restart. It was not a great first experience...

I guess in her case of recurring (and quite similar) nightmares she feels like it's a torment of sorts, totally uncalled for. So this "why" could mean "why is it happening to me?.. Please, stop torturing me..."

Man, don't I know it. When I played a lot AA tank is just what I did anytime it was available, I'd gotten pretty good at it and it didn't stress me out so it became my go-to. The amount of salt I got from pilot players borders on unbelievable at times. It's nuts.
---
The only thing even close is a survive with friends group on dbd who don't know how to handle a good killer. Had some colorful messages from them too.

Ahh yeas...the classic Xbox 360 go to tactic.
---
&gt;Besides exploits, Wanted, being on a team with a player in combat, and workshops:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You can not be forced to PVP.
---
So, excluding all the ways in which you can be forced into PvP, you can't be forced into PvP?
---
Umm... yeah ok bud... 
---
I also hear that excluding all the bugs in this game, the game is really bug-free.
---
I just wanna max out my stealth but not go over any cap.  Has anyone max/min’d this?  Probably, there is a video from AngryTurtle right?
---
I've been trying to power through the photo challenges for some atoms and I think I've spent more time deleting the photos from my gallery than actually playing, to keep my favourites on the loading screens.
---
Kinda yeah entertaining. I gave a good reason. Your ideas would require sections of the map to be separate from the regular map because they'd either have to code quests/missions out of those areas and into other areas, or add on new sections to keep pvp out of the non-pvp map. Not separated it'd cause issues with non-pvp players doing missions in those areas. You think it's ok for non-pvp players to be drawn in by accidentally shooting back (which is being a dick), it's not ok from the non-pvp players view.
---
In over 900 hours of play time I’ve only ever been able to do it three times. The first time I was level 32, didn’t know what it was. Got slaughtered. Second time, I was just getting into PvP, and came second place. Lost to a BE gay plas user. And the last time I did it, was when I first got a BE laser. My first ever BE laser rifle. It was a BE90 laser rifle, and some cunt ended up buying it from my vendor for zero caps because of that ridiculous glitch a while back, before the second third and fourth mass dupe waves of Dupelanders. I have another one now, but it’s only 2*.
---
Sure thing I'll add you!
---
Damn, I'm so glad I made a mod for all of them to shut up for good... It becomes pretty damn annoying after mere half an hour spent in your camp.
---
This explains why the queen keeps dying instantly when I show up within a minute of the fight lol
---
By maxed out, do you mean agility at 15?
---
I have over 3 years experience modding FoNV and Fo4. And anyone who has used the GECK would tell you haven’t by what you just said.      
---
Don’t believe me? Please explain the monster mash event. A PVP event which exists in an existing location at Watoga.      
---
Setting up the combat triggers with Quests requires NO WORLD ALTERATIONS. Noob.
---
“Noped out” def going to start using that
---
Thank God. The wasteland was getting boring.
---
My bad!! 🤣
---
Agree 100%
---
Prime it and you'll use different cores
---
I was thinking of an idea where two people fist fight after drinking vintage Nuka shine. Thought it might be an interesting thing to watch or even participate in. You can even turn your camp into a fighting arena.
---
Nope. 76 is something I play specifically because it's easier than other things I play. If I want to die I'll play monster hunter, doom, or div 2.
---
Yes please
---
Ok here’s my idea if anyone can give feedback:
---
1. Yes private server, 4 staff and 2 players at a time. 
---
2. They can only have 1 weapon, ammo, and the 5 armor pieces of their choice with no clothing over it. I need help on which “magic” weapons to ban but I’d love to keep legendary armor and weapons in. I will also provide 5 stimpacks to each contestant
---
2a. All perks and mutations are allowed, will provide any mutation combination the player wants before the match. 
---
3. The PVP arena will be an indoor room, maybe two floors high with some walls for cover, doors locked and an extra room for the fighters to wait in. I’ll use my entire camp budget on building a viable one. 
---
4. Anti cheat measures- players must share a picture with the staff using the transparent pipboy showing every section of it once when near staff so we know it’s a new picture. They will also pull out the weapon so the staff will make sure it’s not a banned one, and we’ll as double check they have no clothing on besides the 5 armor pieces. 
---
If we’re concerned about hiding something, once we know their carry weight and items, I can provide an exact amount of junk for them to be on the line of overweight and if they can’t run, they have something else on their body hidden. They can’t hide anything inside the arena because they will not be invited into the private world until we are ready for them to fight, and the indoor arena entrance will be locked. 
---
5. I think 4 is more than enough if we keep it 1v1 at a time. 2 checking the items before they’re let it and two indoors to make sure nothing fishy happens indoors.
---
The tournament will be at a specific date and have people sign up by the half hour. 
---

That joke is old lol
---
Ive learned after playing a week and browsing the subreddit that the majority of people here are toddcucks who defend this game incessantly. Pretty pathetic imo.
---
And finaly, that coal will be usefull.
---
Nice word twist. What I actually said was that besides the fair and limited options for PVP, you have only listed hacks and exploits.     
---
        
---
So if the exploits were completely removed, and team killing was disabled, does that mean you would push to remove PVP in workshops and Wanted players? Because thats all that would be left.
---
Moose are awesome, too. Maybe we need a MoosePanda clan?

Added impossible gear and mutations that I think you’d like.
---
Have you tried the shadowed combat helmet? it's a mod unlock from salvaging combat armor pieces. 
---
Here's what it looks like with the mothman gag glasses and pathfinder mask.  https://i.imgur.com/YTroVmp.png
---
Sounds good to me, we need a moose/panda alliance
---
I was about to Google how much does the average bottle cap weigh  and solve this lol
---
Idea for 4. How about just trading with them before the fight and view the inventory live. Make sure no stash boxes are on the fighting floor. Think it will be faster that way! 
---
Idea for mutations. Rad x will suppress mutations for 10 min approx if you decide later on to take them out.
---
The DMV calls people up by number. I like to think J47 waited so long to be called up he turned into a ghoul, and kept waiting. That quest is depressing but accurate.
---
Over the month I've owned 76 I've dropped 80 bucks in the atom store on cosmetics.
---
I feel like that's a huge amount of love giving it's a full price game and they want money for 1st.
---
The fact they want another 12 bucks or so on these rerelease bundles when I own half of them is a scam.
---
I'm done buying atoms. I'd like that cool lamp for for my camp but refuse to get ripped off.
---
They want me to spend money they better fix the store. (They wont)
---
Mmm, long pig.

Having flashbacks of my time in Papua New Guinea.

Supposed to represent his ticket number.
---
Dude was likely huddled on top of OP’s tent when he decided to move it. Which clearly hurt his feelings, hence the “threats”
---
It's part of a quest. J47 was the ticket that person got for the DMV but ya know....bombs fell.  At least you freed his soul so he no longer has to wait
---
I’m not sure.  I have 15 AGI. I think I mean something like this, if there is a max stealth ‘number’ (say for instance 90%) I don’t want the combo of max stealth perk and csa to be over that.  Please, excuse my ignorance on the mechanics. just trying to free up some perk points.
---
Doesn't make it ok
---
Dude was likely huddled on top of OP’s tent, being a douche, when he decided to move it.
---
I think vortex can do it, if not they are really easy. Just drop in the correct file and it’s done. 
---
Personally, I’d stay away from the luck repair and Gunsmithing. It’s not hard to have the materials available to repair. And if you have use weapon master you can repair it to 200%.
---
5.56 uses Violet flux. I do agree the with the handmade being a better weapon. I have had both also and I always go back to my handmade when fighting a queen.
---
No thanks. So they can advertise half of it the month prior, get you to buy parts of the bundle, and then ask you for full price for the cabin because it's a set?
---
I wouldn’t mind pvp if I didn’t lose all my junk. I’m thinking this is why the pvers hate pvp. I don’t mind losing some caps. Once your at endgame this game is so boring that I spend all my time hoarding junk to create weapons and armor to break them down to learn mods or so I can rebuild my camp for the millionth time. I’m not paying for 1st so I’m limited to 800lbs. Create a leader board so the pvpers can get their feels for being the bestest ever. Throw them a few caps. But leave my 20 bulks of wood alone dang it! Lol
---
I think the game is fine. Just dont be a sweaty meta build.
---
Ok
---
Oh lol, poor guy. The bureaucracy is certainly accurate. Lmao
---
I would use mine to jerk off to DUCHASS at the Wayward
---
Get a bloodied and scrip the other 3
---
It's also with the aggression and fervour that J47 rushes the booth that makes it funnier. So reminiscent of people who are pissed off and fed up waiting at the real DMV giving the tell a piece of their mind.
---
I didn't know these existed or that you cannot display them. Now that I know both I am very upset 😡😡
---
See ya next week
---
Great idea! I didn’t even think of the trading aspect. 
---
Do you think mutations should be taken out?
---
same with any hat
---
Ultimately, build and play it the way you want. You can change it later as your style settles in.
---
I NEED THIS ASAP
---
This is very true. Don't disagree with you at all.
---
I meant 15. The higher you can boost it the better, but at 15 agility plus the stealth armor you will not struggle with maintaining stealth.
---
The term your looking for is "stack"
---
I agree with this - it's like the server is on a timer where it will drop mainly a few different types of weapons/armor for a duration of time. Some times you can log in and you start getting the preferable stuff and none of the other. As stated notice what items are already dropping from enemies.
---
It's a me being lazy and copy pasting an old title and not realizing 😂
---
I would love too, but I don't remember what color it is anymore...
---
Nah i just launched it anywhere by accident lmao
---
👌
---
I don't care if you have three years experience fucking your GECK in the ass. Putting pvp events like you want in the overworled where non-pvp players do missions would fuck up the game. You'd have idiots shooting non-pvp players which would result in them shooting back, not realizing it's instigating pvp with another player and not just shooting back at an npc. Chaos ensues, people get pissed off, and even more people will quit playing.
---
Most likely everyone has the same mutations so no I don’t think it will change the fighting aspect that much but I feel like it takes it more down to your armor and build without them and not to mention you won’t have people jumping everywhere trying to run away.
---
&gt;Nice word twist. What I actually said was that besides the fair and limited options for PVP, you have only listed hacks and exploits.
---
No. What you actually said was ignoring all the things that negate your argument, your argument holds up. Let's not gaslight anyone here.
---
Im going to check those out, I had int to 5 just so I can use all the mods in the int tree for mods on weapons and armor. Nothing else seems super useful. I swapped out the lucky mods. What do you think now?
---

---
im about to go grab a beer then ill add you and check out some mods while water and ammo crafts in my camp. I dont have a mic right now but might be able to find something tomorrow when my girlfriend isnt sleeping and I can scrounge around the house. If I cant and youre ever interesting in teaming up and bullshitting ill gladly set up a google voice or some other app to talk with, or ill just buy a mic on amazon depending on pricing lol. I saw they had a text chat on nexus for fo76, any experience with it?
---
Thank you! Not at work, just lazy and don't want to walk to my PC.
---
🙃
---
I didn't know I needed that until now!
---
Lol makes sense 😂
---
Lmaoo
---
You'd think it wouldn't be hard especially since PC players have had the mod since two weeks after the game's release.
---
However, this is Bethesda we're talking about. They haven't even talked about testing it in the PTS yet. It's best not to rush these things. Their choice of priorities is curious, though.
---
Man people really like the term Gaslight this month....       
---
My post wants Bethesda to add optional PVP events and optional PVP teams. So PVP players can enjoy Fo76 w/ PVP - While not bothering anyone who does not want to participate.     
---
What part my idea don’t think will not work?      
---
Because you’re taking us in circles when you keep bringing up exploits. Exploits are not meant to be in the game, I did not put them there.
---
I'm a tiny bit disappointed that House wasn't capitalized.
---
don't let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya.
---
They could just turn team fill off if they don’t want to actually have a fourth. They should be happy they got a random that actually wants to try, and not just run off and hide someplace.
---
I'm a bethesda fan going back to fallout 3, have purchased every fallout and elderscrolls release since than.
---
I not only bought 76 when wastelanders came out but I bought 1st (for a month) when my stash became an issue. I continued spending over 80 bucks this past month to buy atoms for repair kits (bullshit paywall maneuver) and cosmetics.
---
After realizing that no matter how many parts of a bundle I own they want full price for a rerelease is BS.
---
Or the fact other bundles are peice mealed out like mothman but god forbid I want the alien or other toy in the new bundles? Nope, cant buy them.
---
Bethesda is abusing players willing to spend.
---
If they're cool with turning players off once they realize it's a scam, good for them.
---
If they weren't so shady with their barely different skins and bundle ripoffs I'd probably spend alot more.
---
But I'm done.
---
No more atoms for me.
---
Yeah you can’t be believed when you say “Adding PVP will fuck up the game...”       
---
And can not explain why 🤦‍♂️
---
They must've thought everyone will love that tedious and unfun minigame of meticulous scrapping of all your perk cards for yet another currency (totally uncalled for) desperately craving to upgrade absolutely useless and by huge margin quite unimaginatively conceived legendary perk cards. And that this will resolve people's issues with absolute tedium of build switching, when there'd be nothing to switch to after scrapping every single card.
---
Thanks to many people on PTS being vocal about plethora of this system's imperfections on so many levels, Beth decided to postpone the release of legendary perks and regular perks scrapping to the next patches. But they should've at least considered to release of perk loadouts earlier because of this. The only problem is, I presume, that they're still struggling with loadouts implementation, the system's simply not ready yet.
---
There already is....in your **imagination** ....
---
imaginaaaation laaaand come wiiiith meeee to imaginaaaaation land
---
This does not work. I encountered players who were delibatery jumping into my line of shooting. You cant do anything about that.
---
I changed my mind.  Fallout Spongebob Squarepants DLC.
---
The sooner they release it, the sooner they can disable it because it doesn't work and they didn't test it, and the sooner they can release it again! Let's get this inevitable shitshow on the road!
---
Damn gweifers.
---
shame the floor lighting is still bugged.
---
I mean the mod works great, not sure if the author would be fine with them just taking it, but I'd love a system near identical to it being implemented it is as easy as me hitting tab t # and I switch in a second now, i was thinking about setting up macros for it as well. Unfortunately for consoles I doubt there will be a wheel or item binding so it might be clunky for them with any kind of set up.
---
Degenerates like you belong on the floor as piles of ash. My Crusading rifle is ready heathen!
---
there are 3 types of curtains, iirc you can get stuff closer to the walls with the shorter curtains
---
I believe fallout 76 has a fallout 3 reference. In flatwoods you can find a holotape about aliens and the girl is named Sally. I'm really hoping they add aliens and it's the same girl. (I'm aware the flatwoods monster is an alien)
---
Obvious problems with 4
---
* High barrier of entry as it's slow and annoying to do. Might limit players from participating.
---
* Photos can be fakes pretty easily, even with the restrictions you outlined.
---
Only way you could verify items is either:
---
* Supply the items yourself
---
* If there is a working option within player-to-player trading that allows you to inspect all weapons and armour to ensure that they're clean
---
If you can't do direct inspection, I think it'll hinder your ability to get players considerably so you might want to test that out. Failing that, you could supply non-legendary weapons so there is zero chance of cheating and unlikely to have OP comp that'll 1-2 shot people.
---
Also with point 4, I presume no power armour is allowed?
---
Additional to the above, what do you do in the case that someone pulls the plug and forces a disconnect when they're close to losing and blame it on their ISP? In both the case when they're purposefully cheating and when they legitimately get disconnected, because those events both look the same.
---
Also, just a personal opinion, since you haven't even tested the ruleset yet to see if it works, possible improvements, exploits etc, I think it's a bit putting the cart before the horse to talk about tournament timings and such. That's just me though. You work out the logistics of your tournament as you see fit.
---
Players view difficulty on an inverse bell curve it seems. A lot of players find the game too challenging, and a lot of players find it too easy, with a much smaller number who actually find it sufficiently challenging. 
---
My theory based on some observations I've seen in game and on forums is that the game is just as evenly split between highly casual players and players with ample experience with this type of game. It's usually the casual players who say the games too hard and the veterans who say it's too easy. 
---
It honestly all just boils down to learning the game mechanics in depth, creating or following an effective build and participating in trade/social behavior. Players that struggle in all three of those areas seem to have the hardest time with this game while those that have a solid grasp on all three have significantly easier time.
---
I don't think those are bugs....
---
You should probably send your character through a cold decontamination shower. That should solve the randomly unequiping apparel issue.
---
submit a refund request for atoms and say the floors lighting is bugged (because it is)
---
No I am with you there.  I remember first listening to it and hoping there would be more explored in the game.  Great call out.
---
There was the black Knight paint fir the gattling gun. Made the receiver brass
---
What do you mean?  Is there some kind of scale of reputation?
---
I genuinely thought Commander Daguerres story line would involve the aliens and stuff especially since I got spoiled about the end reward weapon. I feel like they’re trying to move away from aliens because so far they’ve always been comically portrayed and they are trying to be a bit more serious with the franchise. I mean compared to FO3/New Vegas and FO4 there’s barely any fun whacky weird stuff going on. I guess there’s the insult bot and stuff but nothing truly weird, most of it is going towards cryptids it seems. I loved the alien dlc in 3 because it had clever writing and introduced a ton of fun weapons plus alien epoxy, preferred it way more than Anchorage since all I did in that one was spawn infinite ammo and guns to sneak out of the simulation.
---
Well that went from 0 to 100 real quick
---
Holy moly.. loosen your fedora and let the blood flow to your brain again, before it's too late..
---
It kinda is, if you read certain stuff and find certain areas they are already in Fallout 76, i found a holo tape suggesting Aliens cause the atomic war, and i've found a dead alien in the back of a dump truck..
---
I'm not sure but i believe our astronaut ally may have been shot down by them.
---
I understand what OP means tho, killing lvl 68 Super Mutants and the scorched queen fight is pretty much endgame. We need more Endgame events with lvl 95 enemies to fight.
---
Lol , what are they paying these devs for seriously
---
I would love to see over 200 messages from one person in a short time span. I feel like that’d be hilarious
---
Lol that sucks, literally no response probably from the fact nobody ever used it in lieu of the jetpack.
---
I had that once, man. Every day this guy would spam the same old message at me. He called himself 'the Grafton Mayor' or something. Seems to have stopped now.
---
Me, too! I was hoping it was like a start to an alien quest.
---
i guess a whole DLC would be a bit much but id love to se a questline and maybe two or three events
---
they could also introduce some alien weaponry along that questline 
---
oddly enough in the survival guide they have a beastiary and in that beastiary there are a few different zetans with all their stats so i guess bethesda at least thought about making them a bigger part of the game at some point
---
Space. Space. Space... SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE.
---
That's not a bug. She is just \*happy\* to see you.
---
The wheel is fine for
---
Me but there are 3 other directions on the xbox   d pad not used also 
---
Eso has back bar front bar 
---
Its basic stuff
---
Inb4 upskirts and bulge pictures on players walls lol
---
I'm pissed off that the Nuclear Winter paints can't be used on it. I actually made a thread about it months ago and got down voted.  I seriously don't understand why I can't use outcast paint on T-65.  I spent countless hours grinding my ass off in NW for the outcast paint and now I can't even use it on my favorite armor.
---
I agree.  I think cryptids are kinda like terrestrial aliens.  It cannot be that far of a reach for them to add some extraterrestrials.
---
I was using the 2 types that snap to window walls. I didn't try the 3rd type that seemed to hang from the ceiling, but if it's less picky about intersecting I'll definitely swap for it.
---
That's a bad ass look
---
upset much? lol
---
i've seen people say that you can ask for refund of atoms if something you buy with them is broken or bugged (water wheel etc) so i submitted a request for a refund for the contemporary bundle that i bought because of the bugged lighting on the contemporary bundle, it's been 2 months and they are still bugged.
---
mentioned in this post (shiny floors ) 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g3nxbd/list_of_visual_bugs_so_far_since_the_wastelanders/
---
So we're talking about hundreds of hours in it. 
---
I get bored of most games after a couple hours. Some 20-30. Other's a bit longer. 
---
There is no game out there that is supposed to last forever. They could, and should, do more endgame content. That is the thing with MMOs. After playing almost all of them they all fail at it eventually.
---
Or some real problems that requires a doctor 🤔
---
I've come back to laugh at OP hahaha, ok bye.
---
You seem to misunderstand (intentional or otherwise) my involvement in this treat. It's to debunk the lie and gaslighting around people not being forced into PvP. 
---
I've already outlined both legitimate and illegitimate ways people are forced into PvP against their will (and if you say workshops aren't against's someone's will, you try completing a challenge that awards precious atoms without putting yourself at risk of PvP).
---
I'm not against there being PvP in the game so long as the scenario is that someone unwilling to participate is NEVER EVER drawn into it. That includes exploits, though I understand that needs to be dealt with as they arise. 
---
All that PvP talk and ideas is fine. Just don't lie to people saying that they're not forced into PvP when it's clear that there are situations that players are forced into PvP. That's all.
---
they should all snap to window walls
---
This is my angry version. https://i.imgur.com/mxWjINQ.jpg
---
Meg's gonna get a explosive vented boot up the arse 🤣
---
Probably not we kill everything in seconds anyway.
---
Hard to fully diagnose, but it seems like the game is mixed between playing it as fullscreen at a low resolution, or is a small borderless window at that same resolution.
---
If you switch it to fullscreen, and set the resolution at your monitors resolution manually (left and right arrows next to resolution), it should go back to normal after you quit to desktop and restart the game.
---
lol
---
It’s back RIGHT NOW. I just picked it up and completely revamped my camp. In love with it
---
Thank you for heads up.
---
I refused to buy the new bundle. I want the classic house styles but refuse to pay basically 12 bucks for something I already own half of.
---
I'm just not buying anything for a long time.
---
They might get me on repair kits but that's it. 
---
Done giving them money.
---
Have you seen how poorly Bethesda sticks the landing on easy shit? Have you seen what they did with legendary perks after being more than a year late?
---
My straight up thought is delete the settings file and then have Steam verify, If its on steam.. that should default them back.
---
Ha! Whatever makes you happy dude!
---
Wrong sub this is 76.
---
Do you you think with a high enough karma player, people would feel comfortable dropping their weapons and armor for inspection? Then when they drop their items, you can check the trade screen to make sure nothing else is in their inventory at all.
---
It might be easier to just supply some non legendary weapons instead, you’re right. 
---
And no, I don’t think I’d allow power armour.
---
And I guess any disconnection, accidental or not, counts as a loss for the player. 
---
I guess I don’t have any friends online to test out these parameters with, but maybe another post finding some people is due.
---
And I’m not trying to sound too eager with the times, it was just a way for me to think about how a 2 player at a time tournament would work and if the time frame would make people less interested.
---
I really do appreciate you helping me figure all this out.
---
I mean, it is *Rose's* questline. On some level I'm not surprised.
---
The annoying thing is it seems like the explosive bait doesn't even attract enemies anymore once you finish that quest stage, so basically the only thing it's good for after that is griefing.
---
Its definitely annoying
---
I have wondered that myself.. I'm not even sure what these devs are doing, are they building other games and just touching Fallout 76 as homework.. Feels like an indie game.
---
Ironic? That could actually be the reason it works the way it does.
---
They said it was fixed but I guess not.
---
I am. That and my rifle firing on its own once in a while. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
+oh ya, and the weird damage from out of nowhere regardless what you're doing.
---
You’re an idiot if that’s the case.
---
I wish bethesda would up the camp budget so we can make sweet camps
---
Bosses mainly.
---
This. Build order is very important, so sometimes you have to "reverse" build to get everything to go away.
---
Usually never have a problem, and if I do they usually don’t go as low as attacking my camp. Thanks for being polite about it.
---
I can fix it as long as I don’t move my joystick, otherwise I’m fine.
---
Most of, if not all of, the toxic players of 76 are from the PvP crowd. What else do you expect when you beat their snotty little asses?
---
Slated for implementation sometime in Q4 2020. From the [official roadmap](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/9UGUzVftM3jzqRiEwOIVw/03407a1787fc019650cb8c2532ca46f6/F76_2020_Roadmap_in-body.png).
---
Why will it take them until near the end of the year to implement one of the most requested features that modders were able to implement themselves in less than a few weeks? No idea.
---
So if PVP was fully optional and had NO RISK of accidentally killing a non-pvp player: you would support my idea?
---
My dad owns Sony and I can get you banned on the next 7 upcoming playstations
---
I'm a level 92 Melee build. Your point distribution is similar to mine. 
---
I would suggest taking charisma lower.
---
If you play on a team 6 is a good score, you can share a 2 star card. If you're solo you can have lonewander maxed and the stimpack perk x2, Or what you prefer. 
---
If you play solo drop charisma to 4.
---
If you plan on getting mutated luck 5 is a minimum. 2 for starched Gene's, 3 for class freak. 
---
Look at your endurance perks, do y really need each one?
---
If you save perks from where I said think about boosting agility.  Lots of strong agility perks.
---
Seems like most aren’t even good at PvP either, my build isn’t even geared for PvP in any way but I guess that’s why snooty little asses are salty all the time.
---
I dont agree with a lot people when it comes to end game. I think it is fine compared to what is on the market. I would rather do sbq or blast zone runs any day compared to doing raids in Wow and wiping all the time. This game is a breathe of fresh air as far as end game to me. The only downside is the stash limit and crafting ss armor /end game legendary items because sometimes you just have to get rid of a ton of stuff just so you can turn back in your crafted legendaries for scrip. Which i feel is punishing for being in the end game. Other than that i love that my character feels powerful and plays powerful !!.
---
That is the main reason I have him those damn fart jokes get me every time.
---
Don't stress to hard man, your SPECIAL is fine. 15 STR is very idle for melee/heavy - all I can recommend is dropping PER to 3 and moving it into INT, AGI and LCK. As long as you have the core cards your build is designed around, swapping out points can come later as you passively level.
---
I am a solo player, I kinda got tricked by the game into thinking Charisma would be relevant to choose certain answers for npcs, but you don't actually need those at all...
---
Thanks for the info.  I'll be buying this within the week.  Wasn't expecting 2mm EC rounds, but at least it will make shells for my secondary gun.  At least it's something! 
---
\-Nil
---
PvP is essentially a gear check at the moment. You can have the best build for it ever but if you don’t have the stealth boys and you don’t have that JE laser rifle or JFFR Tesla rifle glitched to take 999 fusion cells, and you don’t have that ass/sent heavy combat armor then you’re fucked.
---
Edit: Missed Nuka Quantum spamming and Psycobuff spam too.
---
I had an issue in windows 10 with my headset.
---
I solved modifying the format and the exclusive mode. You need to go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Sound and then to the left you'll find a link to the audio control panel (or something like that). Select your device and click "Properties". Just try different settings in the tab "Advanced options".
---
U mean stubbing your toe out of no where.
---
Wait so the combat armor helmet has mods?  
---
I need to craft 50 to scrap to learn it.
---
Sometimes I hit 2-3k and I'm like "shit I'm op" then you have this guy.
---
How. Dare. You.
---
Is that what it is? I thought it was some weird bug.
---
Thats what i call it lol.
---
I like (and wear) the Civil War era suit. It can be found in one of the museums in Helvetia.
---
Here come the sims, enjoy your downvotes.
---
The more I think about it, it does make sense. I always thought I was running into an invisible wall.
---
I know it shows some things are overpowered but personally I hate when this happens I mean I know the only ok things you get from the queen are some ultracite plans and a range of 1 to 3 star gear but from someone who has see it happen it is just a little angering but hey at least if you got there early you still get the quest rewards. But sorry for venting on you and congrats on a big accomplishment. Just don’t let the power go to your head.
---
(This isn’t supposed to be toxic just kinda venting)
---
Yes, because you know large corporations don't track things like that... Microsoft would have that guy fired in a second. I would report him and be proactive. Report him to Bethesda as well... They will ban him for threatening behavior.
---
It has the same material mods as the rest of the items. Your best bet is to make a left or right low level light combat arm and scrap as many as them as you can.
---
There's an organised PvP group that know the ins and outs of what works with PvP and such. Maybe hit up their members to gauge interest in participating and testing. I believe it has to do with the people involved with Fed76.
---
Failing that, I'm sure that you'll find some testers that could help you out if you asked.
---
Good luck with it all!
---
Its been wild, but at least some of the Food Builds have the balls to comment and debate.    
---
But the big number is people who downvote and have no argument. Smh.
---
Me after playing Fallout 76 for hours straight: go to sleep
---
Me 5 seconds later: MISTER FIIIIIIVE BY FIVE, GOT FIFTY CHINS AND A LIIIIIINE OF JIVE
---
4 at lucky hole mine. But I was teamed up. It was a first time fluke. 
---
I've never had more than 2 there solo or teamed up since then.
---
The community is largely shit anymore TBH. People take it way too seriously, like get real world angry 😆
---
I have yet to try it. Never anyone around to try it.
---
Given how bad faith you've been in terms of whether or not people are forced into PvP (which you've yet to correct in your post in a number of places), what's the point of discussing support or a lack of support for your idea?
---
It's kind of moot when the person who wants an opinion on his idea starts from a bad faith position.
---
How about restating your case without all the bad faith aspects to it and we see what people think about it.
---
CHR is used for certain skill checks throughout the game, don't dismiss it entirely.
---
That being said, I'm using 1 CHR and relying on unyielding armor to boost it for checks.
---
But the big number is people who downvote and have no argument. Smh.      
---
They are scared because of the PVP exploits. Because if you remove the exploits theres only 3 forms of PVP left:     
---
1. Team volunteered pvp (Noone wants this).     
---
2. Workshop pvp (half the food builds agree is fair).      
---
3. Wanted PVP, most agree is fair.     
---
Until the exploits are stopped and team pvp inclusion is removed, the food builds will fight this to death.      
---
(Over a bit of junk they might accidentally lose,   
---
If killed by a player rather than a deathclaw on the rare chance after fixes, another exploit comes up: this is why there is an anti-pvp brigade I’ve noticed.)
---
As a person who just finished the grind for T-65 I love it but I agree I wish there was a paint for it but not a paint that changes the appearance of the T-65 if the same hypothetical skin was on other power armors or a T-65 exclusive skin. But don’t fret I did see a video about the up coming battle pass and I did see a leaked design of a paint for T-65 it was silver and red with a indent of the radiation symbol on the torso.
---
It's not a realistic expectation, no offense. They aren't going to go backward and add 65 versions of current paints because it's work with no return. They'll eventually make new ones they can monetize.
---
Okay, is that a reference to something in popular culture that I don't know or did you just make that comeback up?  Because is is super random and f*cking funny as hell.
---
You can give it to a trusted friend then leave the world switch characters and join back and he’ll be able to drop it to your character
---
Yeah. My main charisma perk to use on team is inspirational for xp and strange in numbers to buff mutations. If I'm solo it's lone wanderer which maxes at 4. You can invest in other attributes if u want.
---
I say this game has a good 3 years in it left but I say they keep it running as long as it makes them money.
---
I have a few pieces of weightless armor myself; one of which did replace a chameleon piece. I use them because one is lifesaving and has fall damage reduction, and the other has weapon weight reduction. So for armor, I don’t care about the first effect so much as I do the second and third.
---
Thank you will do
---
Are there any places where I can look for specific builds so I'll know which perks to choose?
---
I have a poisoners primary I just crafted tonight also.
---
It's always a party on xbox servers
---
Thanks very much that was helpful I was a bit worried that I would be locked off from getting it greatly appreciated my dude
---
Haven't seen it yet.... But I sense we are due for a bumper real soon. If it's lacklustre atm it probs is just a gap filler until the major changes kick off.
---
A primed atom store helps Bethesda too so I doubt they'll keep it bare or uninteresting by choice. 
---
As an ESO kid even the Crown Store has a bunch of shit rotations during the year as everyone likes different stuff. Plus they have to rehash old junk for the players who came late to the party.
---
Wise Man's
---
Literally
---
What in god's name does that achieve except for the loss of a whole heap of his ammo?
---
It’s always the same type of people too, people that have 1000+ hours into this game that still have no clue what they’re doing. The exploits and spamming are legitimately annoying, but the vast majority just seem to dislike dying to another player. They’ll spend 1000 hours killing the same enemies, but won’t spend 10 minutes trying to kill me. They’ll die twice, accuse anyone who can kill them of exploiting or being in god mode, and then vanish. They absolute hate anyone being “better” or something, like getting bested at this broken ass game is some sort of detrimental mark on your credit history 😆
---
Multiple people are also theorizing that in the comments
---
As someone who dosnt have Fallout 1st. I would still like to know whats available. Knowing what i could get might make me change my mind and get Fallout 1st. Not for this gun skin, but who knows what iv missed out on.
---
I’m sorry that not addressing the PVP exploits as part of my suggestion seemed rude to you.    
---
So can I just ask one more time...      
---
Please be a good person and put the hostility away for a minute:        
---
If PVP was 100% optional, to the degree. You will not accidently sign up for a pvp team or join a pvp event. Would you support the idea?
---
Lol I’ve always thought it was rolling my ankle. “Oops”
---
I can confirm.  I already have soo many legendaries at level 92, I sell unyielding as the rest are inferior.
---
I feel the same way, no insight in the situation or anything but it definitely runs me the wrong way.
---
I'm level 92. I dropped 1000 rounds of 5.56 for my level 13 bro new to the game. A scummy 150 ran up and grabbed it. Learned my lesson about dropping vs trading.
---
Yeah I’m starting to wonder if the problem is actually their game settings.
---
sooo no update? cause it’s been happening to me lately
---
leave the building and enter again or server hoping, that place is even bugged to enter, had to enter and re-enter 3 times couse the game keept throwing me back to Appalachia
---
I ran into the same Ghoul earlier as well. Took me a second to get the joke, but it was pretty obvious when I looked at it again. God that portion of the quest was too real.
---
Does blocker and Barbarian not stack?
---
Fallout1st should be getting this content free..they are pay way mord than average user..thus funding the system..30% TF.
---
Ok and hope it works I unlogged and relogged into the game hope it fixes it self and if not bye bye antimatter ammo machine
---
When ur on the main subreddit page. Click on the three dots at the top right of the screen (on mobile idk how to do it on pc). Then click change user flair
---
Ya she does that a lot. Had to hard restart my console once or twice to fix.
---
Yep and if u lose your junk to a 1 PVP round: END OF THE WORLD.           
---
Killed by a deathclaw and lose more junks frequently: all good
---
Go to sleep to get the xp bonus before doing anything. Will save u so much time on leveling
---
Thank you now I can show my responder pride.
---
Doesn't a full set of weightless armor allow you to still use your chameleon mutation? You get the benefits of being armored, plus your chameleon mutation. Sounds like a win/win.
---
Chameleon works while you're not wearing armor, weightless armor doesn't count for that mutation.
---
Where/how do you get the Chinese Stealth Armor?
---
it will, at the loading screens they say "remember when you are on a mission inside some place, the game will save your progress on specific point or will save only upon objectives complete, be awere to finish all of it before exiting" (sorry bad English here but you got the idea)
---
Its only easy because of Bloodied and Junkies.
---
I don’t even pick it up unless the person was being a dick. If I really beat on someone for a while, I even go buy a bunch of stuff out of their machines to return the caps. We’re not all assholes who want to cause misery and frustration, most of us are just bored.
---
Yeah I kinda just got sick of this ra-ra child.
---
Because 15-30 is a nightmare to level as everything is either to high or to low.
---
FRAH-GEE-LAY.... must be Italian!
---
she's annoying and slow. just go soft with her and she will help you with the last robot fight.
---
Damn! Did you placing your tent somewhere else really had to warrant** 320 messages** from that guy? Just wow! Please, i too would love to see this as well (Blur out the guys name) i imagine it would be... entertaining.
---
On a serious note: That guy needs some serious help, sounds like anger/mental problems. All because of a simple tent placement? Just... crazy.
---
If you like that, you should play New Vegas with Wild Wasteland!
---
Anything with faster fire rate destroys everything.
---
Faster fire rate is better than even bloodied..
---
Why y’all downvoting this funny ass comment lol
---
c-c-c-c-combo-breaker!
---
Nope
---
I was pretty happy. Don't care about the Americana crap, but 2 bundles I kind of wanted but didn't buy originally were on sale so I grabbed both with saved up Atoms.
---
What turrets can kill a scorchbeast, The ones I've had can't kill a mole rat
---
Yo te podia dar un set, pero estoy en el ps4😅
---
I don’t wear armour, I kill quick and I die quick, just as it should be. You’d be surprised how much strategy is involved if you can die with a single hit from a ghoul. When one see’s you, they all see you and you get ganged. If you have a build that is specifically designed to maximise damage output and protection then you’ve put yourself in that position. Change your build, you’ll have more fun.
---
It could be that every time an enemy loads for a player the 1 in 20 chance to make it legendary gets rolled.
---
But if that was the case then during Queen fights you would see a crazy amount of legendaries.
---
So maybe the chance only rolls if that creature isn't engaged in combat.
---
Best way to test this would be to sneak up to something like a Mirelurk Queen of  Behemoth and have a friend fast travel to you until the enemy becomes legendary.
---
yes, i say this as someone who doesn't have any of the new items too, they just don't appeal to me.
---
A duper is a player who uses gliches and exploits to duplicate rare or annoying items dropping the value of some of the rarest or best equipment in the game and is a massive reason that explosive flamers and energy weapons exist in the first place.
---
Be wise I have a sneak build that can’t withstand much damage. And I that event it doesn’t ,after how well you sneak, shoot one they all come barreling at you. And I also suck at run and gun type gameplay in general, hence why I enjoy sneak builds.  
---
Plus I don’t other with trying to min max, I pick my perks on what I enjoy and fuck having the best build, I play for fun. So, it may not be the most efficient build but it is designed around how I enjoy playing.
---
I feel like it's got a lot to do with what server you're on and what the health of that server happens to be at the time. There's a server I get on sometimes, and there are legendaries everywhere. Then, at times, there's hardly any of them.
---
That sucks, thanks for clearing that up
---
If you can, group up with someone (even a random) and use rank 3 Inspirational for +15%exp. Next I'd recommend crafting some cranberry juice or even better do the Feed the People event and eat the canned stew for +5%exp. You should always try to stay stocked on these so do this event often.
---
Boosting intelligence also increase exp earned so even a set of cheap crappy lv 5 1* Unyielding armor can help you earn a lot of extra exp. Otherwise any other temp buff helps like from Berry Mentats or X-Cell
---
If you're confident that you won't die while leveling up then well rested for another +5%exp is also useful, but Ill skip it if I'm having a bad day and keep getting myself killed. It's a waste of time having to get to a bed to reapply the buff if you're not staying alive.
---
At level 35 I usually farmed public events like Uranium Fever and Line in The Sand. If nothing good was going on I would server hop around Welch and and farm enemies there. If you're confident in your build you could also try West Tek, the best exp farming location in the game.
---
I am not interested in a melee build in this game. Bethesda melee in general feels like mash the buttons to win.
---
That honestly would be super hilarious to see 😃
---
I had the same issue. What worked for me was placing a Vendor at my CAMP (I didn't need to power it up), and remove it through the Vendor inventory.
---
Im an Autisric Artist
---
Kicked her out for Raider Punk
---
Soon as you shoot one ghoul in that event they all know where you are and come running for you.
---
Deathclown
---
alright, And yeah I'm confident in my build, 250 levels on another platform will make you know the meta a little two well... Maybe I should just play something else for a few weeks
---
I am 100% sure everyone who claims to work for console producers is also 100% legit
---
Jason Bourne it's Jesus Christ!

Hey dude I know a this guy that know this other guy that know this Tiger that know this dolphin that know this pigeon that lives in the roof of the Microsoft building and he Gunna get you banned 🤣🤣🤣
---
You'll find in this thread her name's Duchass. 
---
Nice illustration though OP :) Well done!
---
Your complaint is a whiney little b.
---
Thanks👍
---
Curious what % of health this took off? surely she has more than 30k total
---
You’re right, which I guess leads to a side question: what good is the Chameleon mutation? You can be invisible while standing, but it breaks when you move or even when you attack while standing still.
---
No. Get Last of us 2
---
dcg = powerfist. therefore this post makes no sense..
---
Yeah, it’s worth it. The community is pretty chill.
---
Lol I feel that. I hop on for my daily Bouillon/Scrip/Caps/Atoms and a few T. Notes and then I'm off to play Dark Souls.
---
Lmfao
---
Do you play PS4?
---
Yeah, I've been playing Escape From Tarkov, That games grind is worse than 76's
---
You either get it for free as part of the settlers quest chain leading up to before you do the vault raid or buy from them from bullion once you have gained enough reputation after you have done the vault raid.
---
I do. My PSN is WorkablePuffin.
---
Never at full price. If you see it for sale, maybe. Depends on what you want out of the game.
---
Don’t post it here, his buddy at Reddit might get you Reddit account banned.
---
Oh, cool. I'll have to find you sometime if I ever get the game.
---
I love her fucking 3 star nocturnal, vats, 90% lighter lead pipes.
---
&gt;I’m sorry that not addressing the PVP exploits as part of my suggestion seemed rude to you.
---
See what I mean about bad faith? Totally ignored the several legitimate ways you can be forced into PvP but you've proven you're not a good faith actor.
---
I think we're done here.
---
No, you can only learn those mod from plans that you get completing certain quests.
---

I'm on Xbox unfortunately. Please do send me pictures or let me know if you make a post sharing them.
---
I just want to dip my toes in and see what it's like.
---
There's no "at least" with practices like this, it should be damnable. I don't want gambling for real life money in my games, it's simple, really, nor do I want a furniture set that will cost me 3000+ atoms. The crown store has gone too far, and sadly -- I can see 76 going down that route, "one Appalachia" and Seasons made me remember ESO and what followed after. Bethesda is cutthroat when it comes to business like that, and since one system worked out for one failing game..then..
---
It's a great game, and absolutely worth playing
---
Like one of the other comments said look for a sale, or check out eBay, I've gotten two separate copies for friends for $15 Canadian each with free shipping
---
How?
---
Here’s my Junkie explosive commando build. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6e226ce&amp;d=pd2pk2pp2pl2p01ib0ic1a71c70ep0l71lt2lu2s12a04s01sb2ek0l12a32lr2sv0au1&amp;w=li2s70c51eh1c80c31i82ii0ij2i60if2ik0iq2ld2lk2i91&amp;m=a8ef9c5&amp;ad=03478
---
I might check eBay then to see how much they'd be for PS4
---
Also some you can buy from faction vendors.
---
Yep i had a similar workaround. I put them for sale in my vendor then was able to remove them that way
---
This post isn’t about fucking exploits and forced PVP for fuck sake!     
---
Everyone knows those need to be removed. I made it very clear: “not talking about forcing anyone to fight, my idea is optional.”     
---
Somehow the basis of my idea missed you, and here I was thinking you disagreed with PVP events and PVP teams....     
---
You have been arguing with me for the past 3 hours.... because you thought I was denying the current, terrible, current PVP situation.     
---
You need to re-read everything. This post is to discuss the idea of adding new features, not addressing bugs!
---
Thank you 👍
---
hopefully for a long time.
---
Would be terrific if they next gen'ned this game engine, and just focused on expanding the title with quests, lore, etc.
---
We would pay for good content.
---
Take a look at WARFRAME Bethesda...YOU can do it....BETTER!!!
---
I put that on beckett. He's my hishoric bartender now.
---
I had the restart the mission to fix it. Sadly the rest of the raider quests were bugged so I had to go with settlers.
---
I feel like it benefits somewhat from the fact that its lower weight benefits your stealth. I mean it's no Unyielding but its not too bad. I run a full set and it works "okay". But thats my 5th character and I'm just trying something new tbh
---
If that's the case, try it on sale, and that's coming from someone who would pay the $40.
---
Nah, narrative disaster. They failed to understand what made the first game great, and then turned it into a basic revenge TWD type story.
---
the Fallout multiplayer community in summation.
---
It’s the same on mobile too. Checked it and added a title too
---
OMG I love you.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Pretty thin excuse since a bundle of physical products including something you already own doesn't actually reduce the value of the bundle since you'll still get use of all the products. If I get a grooming kit including hairspray that I already have a bottle of, now I have 2 bottles of hair spray to use. With this you're just paying the same price as everyone else for much less value.
---
Sadly The Speakers + Pressure Plates are enough to go over the blueprint budget limit.
---
Bloody mess is a must for me no matter what the build
---
I rolled a really good bolstering w ap.refresh and so far havent even bought as limbs. I have 15 modules and roll about 5 every 2 days no unyielding as of yet
---
Read the comments on that website, my god people are stupid.. they honestly believe covid is a scam O.o
---
Falloutbuilds.com seems like it has what you're looking for
---
They had it on the PTS and it is ready however after player feedback they decided that they wanted to make some changes to make the perks more enjoyable. Which TBH is needed they were underwhelming and not very creative.
---
It’s sad how rare the spawn is for it.
---
Don't you mean agreed 100%?
---
Watching that koolaid drain away is both sad and exhilarating at the same time.
---
Bring me back indeed
---
Legacy Weapon? Yeah, I suppose it is.
---
Legacy Effect? Probably not.
---
Of all things bees why not sticks and rocks 
---
Man I love that event
---
I would be, getting the legendary isn't my be all end all, using said legendary is.. Hell i'm still using a lv 35 minigun because its the best thing i own.
---
I had a similar bug just yesterday but further along where I had to get the pulse grenade but none of the robots showed up.
---
Bonus points if you're at the edge of a mountsin making them fall to their deaths
---
Yes if you don't mind getting bored after about 300 hours mark.. thats not a bad time frame. The bugs and annoying mechanics are still plentiful though and Fallout 76 is a requirement really.. but get two to three months worth not a year if you do purchase it.
---
Basically what person said earlier plus current fights are not hard but obnoxious. For hard fight should not be put bullet sponge with big damage but good proggramed AI and proper equipment (something like half life's bot tactic but faster). Fighting bullet sponges is not fun.
---
For most purposes (eg. trading) I don't think so as you can in theory get a natural drop with the same effects.
---
The term 'Legacy' is typically reserved for weapons with effects  longer drop such as 'double' and explosive on energy weapons. 
---
Also, for trading, most people when they say legacy actually mean powerful legacy eg. Explosive plasmas etc. as most of the value comes from the op/broken nature of the weapon not just the fact its no longer dropped.
---
Well done!  It took me awhile to figure it out too.
---
The standard .50 is the highest Damage, if I'm remembering rightly.
---
Armour-Piercing has a cap too, so with Tank Killer (perk) and Anti-Armour (Legendary), Stinging or Swift  magazines (one of those) should be a better option than Perforating for Magazine Size and Reload Speed.
---
I liked the DLC for F3,  then again the existence of that DLC means it's already been done (and extensively, as it was a rather big DLC). So I don't expect any major Zeta stuff being added, besides perhaps a UFO crash site like in F4.
---
Cool thank you for the info it was something i would never trade for the reason stated but to me its a collection piece and i like it as a reminder of survival mode. was lookin for info on it and you told me what i wanted to know thanks friend jave a good day ;)
---
I’d certainly say so! Grabbed it a few weeks ago on Xbox during a sale and certainly have no regrets!
---
I'm fairly sure that getting wanted after attacking a peaceful player was already in the game, but for some reason they took it out.
---
It doesn't. They only work on pistols, rifles and shotguns. They don't work on any heavy guns.
---
I see what you mean but is it really a big deal of you can't be injured? Personally I just let them waste ammo and weapon condition. While sending them heart emoji. It winds them up no end and amuses me.
---
I am seriously regretting not getting it but piecing out the bits I'd wanted originally. I really cannot justify all those atoms down for...railing.
---
It's such a good set and past me should've known it.
---
my friends dads friend works at Microsoft so you better watch out
---
Yeah so you can grief with slap damage and destroying camps, all you people want is to grief, you don't want to play survival mode because then you have to try to kill people who will actually fight back.
---
Adventure is changing for the better, suck it up, this is not a PvP orientated game, never was and thankfully never will be, go play CoD.
---
One word: Skyrim
---
They still support that game... so, who knows.
---
I am convinced the devs don't *play* the game. They write it and do some testing. It's understandable that someone gets tired of the project and needs some outside opinions. That's where private playtesters come in. Those people must either not exist or must be completely ignored. Or both devs and playtesters must play the game entirely different from the rest of us.
---
It got quite better. If you like Fallout universe you will probably enjoy the story. Level design and enviroment is nice too. But lategame is still boredom. Long time grind limited by artificial caps so you have to play daily. And the worst part is the activities you need to do are super simple and not challenging at all. It feels more like doing chores than quests.
---
it's not a big deal, it's just annoying and maybe if they got the pvp they wanted by being made wanted, they'd go away after doing it a little, rather than following me around my camp the whole time I'm there as i try to fix my armor or load my machines.
---
Same.
---
Assuming an even distribution, not rolling something in 100 tries that has a 1/18 chance on each try has a probability of 0.33%. So it's rare but not outrageously so - one in every 300 players will see drops like this (and come here to complain about it).
---
This doesn't mean that assumed-to-be-random drops aren't behaving weirdly, but it also doesn't constitute damning, or even persuasive, evidence. I can assure you from personal experience that Unyielding does drop for Secret Service armor pieces including the chest, and at roughly the expected frequency, too.
---
Yeah. Sadly no upgrades or buff to Alien Blaster
---
if they kill you when you don't fight back, they become wanted. but with pacifist set they can't even damage you so they just keep shooting and shooting and nothing happens. it's so stupid, i just thought of they got wanted and got the pvp they wanted that way, they'd go away after a few shots into me.
---
The game has gotten mostly unplayable due to menu lags or action lags. 15 seconds to change weapon = I die before i can fight. lag between shooting and bullet hitting target means target moves or gets hit by many bullets at once once the lag time completes (this can be funny or tragic). Lag trying to use NPC or camp vendors means I have to spam the buttons hoping they will work. This really got bad about 2 weeks ago.
---
Please, fix the damn servers and program
---
I never tried this myself but I heard player detonate them manually by shooting the trap vis V.A.T.S.
---
It goes for $14 preowned in Australia at EBGames, depending on where you are I'm sure you can pick it up cheap from your countries equivalent.
---
I can’t lock on to them
---
At this point I'd take any new quest lines as long as they are delivered in a timely fashion.
---
Yes i know ur right
---
Block them and fast travel.
---
Lol don’t trap your vendors then, and I won’t fill it with explosive bait and nuke mines ;)
---
It's called flair and it does absolutely nothing apart from having a little title next to your name, some subs give it to you automatically, some have preset ones you can pick, and some let you set your own
---
Or the random scavengers that always seem to think it's almost time to eat
---
I think its only mobile which is weird as i can't do it on my pc.
---
Awesome work.
---
Side note: Why does your gun say "Butt Fucker" on the stock? 😂
---
Definitely doesn't seem to work as well for snipers. Can't get sneak multipliers if I have to wait for the enemy to find me and shoot me back before I can do any damage.
---
I want to say it sounds like a surround sound issue, like perhaps you're using stereo speakers but windows is trying to send audio through 6 or even 8 channels, have you had a look through your soundcard settings to ensure its all correct? Depending on your soundcard you may simply need to do it through the windows audio settings or there may be a driver based program you need to change settings in.   
---
Could also be something totally different. What sort of soundcard and speaker setup are you using?
---
Here's a Checklist Database that shows you where to get certain plans or mods for things: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
For your specific example you would get the Shielded Mod for Brother Underarmor with a 5% drop chance from the Quest Forbidden Knowledge **AFTER** you have also already learned Treated, Resistant and Protective Lining for the Brotherhood Underarmor
---
That whole quest line is buggy af, I had to glitch through the last door with the photomode glitch as it wouldn't open
---
i know that is a solution, I'm simply suggesting another option that would mitigate the nonsense. give them what they want, but in a legitimate way.
---
I agree for the most part, except for this:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;They need to learn who we are, before they trust us.
---
They don't seem to ever trust us, even with hundreds of missions done (for free), and high rep. They still 'have their eye on you'.
---
Eh, you'd occasionally have instant one shots, but I agree they were few and far between. Early on I'd hunt players with bounties on them, and with a stealth/rifleman build and a two shot black powder rifle I could one shot someone in power armor if I snuck up on them, but of course that was somewhat balanced by the need to one shot them so I wouldn't be merc'd while spending a minute reloading a musket.
---
I've been playing this game for about a month now and have yet to see anyone play that event.
---
They did yesterday when a guy was throwing them in my camp blowing up my house
---
Uhmerika photo frame. Land of the free, home of the brave.
---
First time I’ve heard of a fixer too.
---
Ty sir!
---
Or at some ones camp to destroy it (provided they don't leave the server, they most likely will.) Or to change flora and fauna to radiated versions used for crafting end game items. And finally to blow out your earbuds.
---
This, so much this!
---
If you have a bounty then it's fair game
---
Did you finish the bucket list quest? I noticed that would happen until I completed that and then it stuck.
---
I can't remove the Foundation Daily item from mine.
---
I've spent 5 years trying to get that damn pie. I finally got 1 a couple weeks ago, same place. Got another one today, same spot. I think the one in the Rusty Pick has higher chance of dropping to make people feel better when they get garbage drops from turning in scrip.
---
I'm not sure you can stack the effects and I couldn't find a definitive answer to this but IF it does stack like most things do in this game it'll probably be multiplicative, not additive so you wouldn't get that 50% Suppression.
---
There is door you can open once you have made it far enough, so of you die it's a short walk back. This same door can be used for some trickery.
---
Nicely done! Keep the good karma flowing in Appalachia! I figured I should say something relating to your content not your composition.
---
This is all much more exciting than domestic life I assure you.
---
I found it works very well as a sniper build from a distance, helped me take down really nasty stuff at around lv20-30.
---
Why not just server hop? It's part of the game, thankfully most the community isn't like that
---
I got the same remarks about the utility perks. All the food perks and 'stuff don't brake easily' perks can go if you want to optimize your build.
---
I do like to mention that it should fit your playstyle. I doubt you need so many food perks but if you run out of food a lot, some might be usefull FOR YOU. So I would slowly change these perks one by one, play and see if you can do without.   
---
Same for the repair perks. If you equip 'fix it good' level 3 during repairing, you do not need white knight. If you equip 'weapon artisan' during repairing, you do not need gunsmith.
---
The reduce weight perks under strength I would try to change after changing the other two categories above. For example if you don't have more armor than the pieces you wear, sturdy frame might not do as much for you as maybe an extra level in traveling pharmacy, or maybe a bandolier perk or a pack rat. Changing one perk for an other perk can make a huge difference. Also a word of caution: while you can completely do without weight reduction perks, the game can become unplayable (over encumbered very quickly). So here is is definitely worth trying out one perk at a time.
---
Mines yellow, but I use the overlay thing and not the actual pipboy
---
If your going to afk at a workshop do it in a private. If your in a public then your pretty much free caps and junk.
---
That would make sense.
---
I had already finished setting up a whole slew of defense and turrets, and didnt want to redo it. Thankfully he’s gone now, but I seem to see more these guys everyday. Maybe I just have bad luck idk
---
Xbox has the same features, there is also a "dont bother" option you can put on your profile which prevents any pop up messages to appear on your screen, great for when chilling on netflix or youtube
---
That name tells me everything I need to know about this player lmao
---
Was hoping to keep my vendors up so people can browse when I’m afk. Thing is I have no junk on me, and it was 20c per kill so idk. I feel like there’s a many many better ways to get 20c then to repeatedly hunt down and kill a single player
---
Oh ok so you'd get 30% then 20% remainder?  Like 30% of 100dps = 70dps then 20% = 56%?  Still not bad at all! I'd take 56% dmg reduction.
---
You can report a message with bad language and they will get a comms ban, the message will get deleted by Microsoft and they will be gone, I only do it occasionally because I’m not a prick
---
Hi, everyone! I'm new to F76, have only 100+ hours, but have an addition to your PVP vs PVE discussion. My English is not perfect, but I hope, I'll be able to be clear.
---
 I don't think splitting people into different PVP/E servers would be a good idea, because its online is not big. This move will leave more servers unpopulated and boring to play on. I believe PVE and PVP can easily exist together. 
---
First of all, we need to question, what is the player's goal in PVP and PVE mode. For PVE it's quite obvious- complete storylines, quests, farm cosmetics and plans with no one to mess with it. For PVP it may be the same, plus having fun killing those, who are weaker/competing with the same skilled player/ overtaking one, who's way stronger. To satisfy both groups there could be several things:
---
1. More optional PVP areas, like workshops. It doesn't mean to create more workshops, but maybe something different, like indoor location with a rare loot, where an amount of players can compete, and only one will get it (for sale for for their own pleasure). The thing is that it should be within the game, not the separate mode, like NW.
---
2. I believe, bethesda should rebalance "wanted" mechanics. There's absolutely no point in head hunting in F76, because the cap reward is ridiculously small. Increasing it can involve more people in PVP with not messing with PVE players activities. Everyone would be happy (except the one, who's been hunted, but they should know, what are they going for).
---
3. The last, but not least. That pacifist mode should be reworked. How I see it. It should be called "pvp ready" and turned off by default, so people won't be killed unexpectedly. If a player is not "pvp ready", then they play the game like always, meaning they're playing PVE. If a player is PVP ready, then their camp can be destroyed, they can be killed and looted, like in a PVP zone. Increasing the amount of a "cap reward for a head hunting" which I described in p.2 will result in more conscience PVP, cause now people would question themselves if they want to be just griefers. 
---
That's it, maybe I missed anything, so correct me, if I'm wrong.
---
Had a bunch at radiation rumble today. Like 7 or 8 and we only collected like 36 ore. I also went up north of Grafton by the lake and saw six bears 20 stag 5 rad scorpions and like another 15 snallys all fighting each other in a ditch lol so I threw a couple plasma grenades and laughed to myself. This game is weird sometimes.
---
If you take over a workshop you voluntarily agree to pvp. Anyone is able to go and kill you or take that workshop for themselves. And while you are right there are way better ways to make caps most people like the satisfaction of killing another player repeatedly.
---
What do you mean overlay thing?  I usually use a miners helmet just to have white light but it has two options, 1) dim or 2) surface of the sun.  The bright option for miners helmets is so bright it blinds my friends
---
I live right where you are. Frank has been a 3* to me 4 times. One time dying and his vanished, the bastard.
---
Sorry to hear big black cock 69 that actually is a pretty sad story man :/
---
Just really frustrated that he doesnt even want the workshop, just hunts me down every time I respawn to kill me. That’s why I took an obscure one. Laughing at me, dming me to mock me, destroying everything I’ve built etc that’s what really got me tbh
---
i’ve never seen it sold in vendors personally, but if you’re looking for less than 10 each, i wouldn’t mind selling them to you. i’ve been farming each nuke to create stable flux :)
---
I really don't explain things properly, so instead of looking at the pipboy on your arm, it just brings up a menu
---
[Like this](http://imgur.com/Ik0GHYW)
---
I haven't played in a long time so can't tell you exactly how to do it, but I think you bring up the pipboy then change view button, or hold it, can't remember sorry
---
Nuke some forest and pick raw flux by yourself. then stabilize it.
---
Thanks for this. Maybe when they finally remove the survival mechanics (thirst and hunger), I will feel comfortable tweaking my perks and dropping all my food so I can run around with Dodgy.
---
on wich platform do you play?
---
People who cant hold their own in matched pvp attack lower level players. They're the worst kind of scum but people defend them because you "volunteered because workshops!!!" 🙄 its the equivalent of kicking a toddler because you got your ass kicked in a bar fight. people need to grow the fuck up and learn how to aim so they can challenge people in their own level range. 
---
TLDR: git gud or get gone 🙄🙄🙄
---
While I do engage in pvp quite regularly I dont go as far as to bully the person or belittle them in any way. You just got unlucky and met a super toxic person.
---
Theres a bug where some blow up, some are delayed, and some just never go off. 🤷‍♀️
---
Bethesda has done a decent job rectifying the glitches from duping.      
---
If there were no exploits or anything, including volunteer team pvp:      
---
Would you be against the idea of optional pvp teams that can only hurt each other and not people involved?       
---
As same due with pvp events?
---
I hear that Settlers is less buggy, so that’s probably a good call. I sided Raiders and unfortunately had to start the vault raid 3 different times before I could get it to work.
---
It seems im actually lucky when it comes to RNG. I did it the same way as you did. Had around 100 modules prepared by the time i got all secret service armor plans. And i even splitted them, so 20 modules for each part. On legs and arms i got unyielding effects (with semi useful perks or 1*) on at least 2 pieces each. But the majority was chameleon. I don't get it either with this RNG, but i (as probably some of you) have a routine by now when rolling. I always do it on private and on 5% HP and I KNOW, i cannot influence RNG like that the slightest. But it always bought me luck somehow. Yesterday i did a 36 module gauss shotgun crafting spree for the first time and got a Q3325 and B50limp out.
---
Take note of the name, block. Server hop. Never have to deal with the individual again.
---
Really wish I could have done raiders. The settler outfit reward is boring and only having ward for daily quests is annoying.
---
Did this yesterday and so far so good. Thanks!
---
Thanks I guess.
---
Its the power armour pipboy screen, you press RMB on PC to swap between the standard pipboy and the power armour one (only works when not in PA though) and tbh it doesn't change the colour of the light emitted by the pipboy anyway, its still green.
---
I have learnt to adapt, ask questions and develop in PVP as I was often beaten down many times in survival and in adventure in the early days Personally, I enjoy PvP and but also understand some people’s reluctance to partake in it but I do agree there needs to be more balanced opportunities in adventure to do PVP After all it is supposed to be a post apocalyptic world where there will be hostile negotiations. I think faction based events with people able to choose to opt in would be a great angle to the wastelanders  content as there are many references by the NPC s in the game wanting to engage with each other factions. Hunter\hunted could do with a bit of love to encourage more involvement greater rewards chance to respawn into the event as opposed being quickly eliminated.
---
I’ve tried to like NW but the load times and failure to connect and lag that I get has just put me off. Survival was not really though out well enough but I did enjoy it and wished I had played it more now that I understand how to PvP better.
---
Trade on market , i have about 1000 of each lol
---
&gt;forcing pvp on someone 250 levels lower
---
&gt;I just claimed a workshop
---
😒
---
We need Mr. Pebbles flair!
---
Your suggestion is the only one that worked. I wish I can give you more upvote but I can’t 😅
---
I’m looking for bulk. But I’ll take what you’ve got. How much for what you’ve got?
---
How much you wanna sell them for? Maybe a sell and a trade combo?
---
I did tried the rug method but it seems to disconnect the wire the moment I move the conduit outside the dome. Maybe I did something wrong there.
---
If you have any friends that wouldnt mind giving a low level fixer that'll help a lot, I used one from level 20-40 on and off mixed in with melee weapons. If you can't get that I don't know how good it really was but I used a hunting rifle up to level 20, the ammo for the hunting rifle seems fairly abundant at low ranks.
---
I do that with my level 129 Heavy Gunner to high level players. I hit them and If they want to pvp they attack back (mostly they do because they think I'm an easy kill) so I only kill those at the end who attack low levels.
---
I have for this reason extra a pvp chat wich I use to attack high level players. They mostly attack back because they think I'm an easy kill. I would never pvp against someone lower then level 100, but I know technically everyone is equally strong at level 50.
---
do you play on pc? i plan on selling them for 100 caps!
---
Ps4. I won’t pay over 50 anyways. Thanks!
---
Im gonna keep em , using for all types of ultra ammo :D 
---
i have sold some for 200 each (some sell for 150 but imo its the rarest junk in the game so ) 
---
How much would you need ?
---
True but the experience you get after level 50 does count so it's not entirely fair.
---
He has turrets; and they don't take as much budget as he uses.
---
or do it like fallout would tell you how to do it , put away all sniper rifles like hunting rifle/gauss rifle and go for fully automatic weapons like fixer/handmande, they have almost same damage output but that DPS is much bigger . FO76 in nutshell
---
If you wont go over 50 you got to find someone whos duped all flux . Not easy finding someone who legit farmed and gonna sell for 50 each
---
Hunting rifle is going to be your best for semi automatic early game. They start appearing about level 5. Just go beat up on scorched and scrap the hunting  rifles you get off them to learn the mods. Your gonna want to craft a new one every ten or 15 levels but hunting rifles can be used well into late game when lever action rifles starts dropping. 
---
Scrap enough pipe action bolt guns and you can build a decent low level sniper rifle. .38 ammo is plenty early game. 
---
Shotguns are also relatively good early game.
---
It's funny seeing level 300+ people bullying low levels, then turn to me and instantly eat a salve .308 from my MG42.
---
Took me a hour to guess we’re those words were from lol
---
What enemy in this game does such dmg that supressor is needed ? Especially if running full health
---
Understand! No problem! 200!? Wow. I thought the going rate was between 50 and 75? It is indeed a tough item to farm when no nukes are falling. 
---
I’m selling serums and need it for that. So, not sure how much I need. As much as I can get I guess.
---
That’s not really the issue why I’m mad. The fact that he dmed me to laugh and mock me as well as destroyed the whole workshop was what got me
---
Yeah, I guess so. It’s definitely tough to farm it.
---
Why are all the American outfits undearmor?
---
Yes I also went to a camp the other day that had extra budget. It was designed like a elven realm with atom plants all over,warm lights and pretty much everything you could imagine.
---
They're stuck with that because of the glitch ,but it is so good you don't need much more.
---
Do you buy stable flux or farm it and then craft?
---
If you are not gonna mass produce i recommend buying a Shielded underarmor of each type . Much faster and easier 
---
I have all but the raider , its a bitch to get , and some things is still fun to grind for despite 1600h in game lol
---

SHUT UUUUUUUUUUUUUPPP
---
Player vendors. Probably get a complete 1* set for under 2k
---
I get from sbq fights a few , most i have gotten in trades , one dude gave me 150 of each for a mask
---
Try equipping a armor piece with reduced dmg while blocking ;)
---
I see player vendors selling flux from time to time. Rates from 250 to 750 that I’ve seen. I have about 20 of each saved up for things. The hardest thing for me to find is the high rad fluids. Just saw someone today selling some so I bought them all and went on a flux hunt so I could craft a bunch. Good luck on your journey!
---
Yeah. I pick some up from the sbq fight too. Not many are dropping nukes now it seems. Looking for some sellers. Wow! That’s a good deal I guess lol.
---
Good advice. I would go further, drop to 2 on charisma. Solo player here and learn to live with lone wanderer at one. Swap with travel agent while non combat. I run a 3 on luck for starch genes
---
Um, they possibly attack the lower level guy that just shot them first. It's a bit like throwing a ball past a dog and being surprised it ran after it.
---
Thank you much!
---
It was one of the more emotional quests for sure!
---
Did you end up repairing everything? If you need some materials, I'd be happy to help.
---
Only a bumass uses .38
---
Not only, often seeing people kust randomly attack low levels.
---
I used the hunting rifle for a while, then I used a marksman sniper rifle and just took the long scope off. But what you really should try to find is the lever rifles, their awesome for a rifleman build
---
An you have to be watchfull for the tiny pennis who make trap camps guy got a bit of bulked fertilizer an some glass as i was looking for flux to build my decon arch ahh well hope he enjoyed the explosive bait
---
I believe there is some bug with vats where the first shot misses. I don't recall the way to get around it. It may be to charge your shot before entering vats or something.
---
What?
---
All charge up gauss weapons are sketchy at best. They all seem to struggle with vats and I found they frequently locked up and couldn't be reloaded or fired. Top quality testing from Bethesda for their end game content . . .
---
Gatling plasma is more like a gatling
---
Yea, getting DMs is always annoying, so I'll give you that. I used to get salty messages all the time playing Battlefield 4. PS4 has the option to change DM privacy settings, so I just put receive messages from friends only
---
When you go camp to camp 
---
People are now making trapped ones to kill players shopping at their machines
---
That's a really good point and something that's being on my mind.
---
I have no idea how the survival mechanics will shape up because I feel that they will introduce something to counterbalance. Time will tell.
---
In terms of food, due to the abundance of water, carnivore mutation and generally meat being everywhere, I just never found a reason to carry too much food apart from a few inert flux.
---
Perhaps might be worth tweaking your perks so you get rid of all your food and just survive on what you find. It's actually not that bad, though having carnivore would definitely make a significant difference,
---
Oh. Idiots. Thanks for the heads up!
---
I was going to say the same thing, farming flux is a nightmare in this game so you’ll be paying a couple hundred caps a piece, and that is IF you can find it. I’ve only seen it at 1 vendor and I’m over lvl 100
---
Lots of news games always coming through... I'm now 60 and still and avid gamer albeit a lot slower 👍
---
Well that often occurs due to corrupt data and system issues. I'd suggest clearing the cache on the PS4. Look up how to do this as I don't want to risk giving wrong instructions, but hopefully it will fix your issue.
---
or the phrase, "does it stack bro?" haha
---
This guy had his vendors behind curtains which should have made me suspect something he repaired a huge stack of punji boards on top of me even with light footed on still killed me
---
I wouldn't mind if I actually did something like kill a legendary without anyone else getting a hit or something but yeah I only moved my tent lol. I'll try to put a pic up later today, every message says the same thing though
---
I get this occasionally on my ps4. Generally I will delete the game cache and reinstall... It won't take days because the DLC is still in the memory its just the start up files.
---
There are lots of posts about these and other faults on YouTube.
---
I've played since launch and imo opinion they didn't deserve all the negative press they got. It was like mob mentality too over.
---
2nd part I completely agree with you. 
---
What the comment above said is also true, the daily limits is a pain in the ass and is clearly design to boost daily logins.
---
My dad is Bill Gates..   
---
Don't worry OP.. I got you!
---
luckily someone came and built it up with me. thanks so much though :D
---
That seems to work well for lots of weapons 👍
---
This made me laugh so hard. Just the mental image 🤣🤣🤣
---
Did you go into the room behind frankie? The feels...
---
Yeah me too, brother
---
Huh. Yeah in that case, that dude is mentally insane. 320 messages of the same thing? Guy belongs in an asylum that's for sure.
---
Damn you. Now I want to do another survival playthrough on FO4.
---
What platform are you on and what level are you?
---
Are we talking crafted weapon or legendary?
---
Yep!
---
Lol they can't do anything to you for playing the game in your own way
---
Horrible voice acting of Frankie ruined it for me.
---
thanks for the good suggestions!  
---
i wear the chinese suit, it would be great if there was something stylistically appropriate
---
Yes, it’s a thrid gen ryzen.
---
It's the damn synths, something about the cache. What the others said, look up the thing about it. 
---
I found that the reinstall goes faster. You probably know about RestMode downloading, but it's worth mentioning to save time. Get the download started, then put it in RestMode in the power off option acreen. just goes faster, but you probably know it.
---
That sounds awesome. I had an idee for a horde beacon to do something similar at workshops: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gzlqbj/horde\_beacon\_request/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gzlqbj/horde_beacon_request/)
---
They need to end pvp rewards to make pvp better. I have Bush wookied many times cause I just wanted the rewards and only way to get them was. It doesn't help they made the game so much more rewarding to just hide then try and fight if your bad at it
---
I’m calling my friend who’s dads brothers wife works at Costco and she’s gonna whoop your ass how dare you move the tent
---
And if you take into consideration recourses and time to drop the nuke and run collecting stuff needed 150-200 each is not such a bad price
---
Wholeheartedly agree that legendaries have no place in PvP. It’s PvE where you get to play easy mode, tearing through everything in your path. PvP ought to carry tactical decisions and effort into a fight, not just a gear and perk optimization contest.
---

---
The wanted system is messed up anyway. Killing a wanted player allows anyone on their team to attack you. I've taken the bait too many times before realizing what they're doing
---
It’s kind of stupid he didn’t get a bounty either
---
I also avoided it at launch due to the bugs, kinda wished I hadn't now at 300 hours in, loving it.
---
No idea on the community on PS4 but the PC crowd are decent in my experience.
---
Ya it’s not super hard, but extremely time consuming. I don’t even sell mine because it takes so long to find high radiation fluids
---
This is exactly the point! I think the majority of the PvP community understands the PvE communities desire to opt out of PvP. People act as though we literally want to be able to kill anyone at anytime but that's not at all the case. We mostly just want the opportunity to PvP as other players can be far more challenging than anything else in the game. It's fun for us, just like it's fun for the PvE crowd to do nothing but kill mindless drones.
---
New PvP events and faction based PvP are the perfect ways to include PvP without forcing anyone to participate. I also agree the existing events should definitely get some better rewards too. It actually surprised me how bare bones the faction system is when Wastelanders released, but this could easily help add more depth to it.
---
The game was advertised as having PvP when it was announced. Its something that interested me since then. I understand those that don't have an interest in PvP, but I would much rather see it be improved than simply removed because some players feel it doesn't belong in the game.
---
No RNG is truly random. The algorithm needs to work off a *seemingly* random value that it's programmed to grab from *somewhere*. I have no idea where Fallout 76 grabs this value from... But, as others have suggested, if you're getting crap rolls, stop. Relog to another server or wait for another time, hopefully the game will have grabbed a more favourable *random* value to run its algorithm off. Just my opinion!
---
This sub is like dlc to the game. You get little bits of gossip, a hacked Info leak, and honestly your in this world where some of the NPCs are right here on this board.
---
Totally agree!
---
Yes, that is why I advertise working for Microsoft everyday since I live in Seattle... I must work for them.
---
And as a farming option, I like to do speed runs of West Tek.  It's full of super mutants, so it's excellent XP.  With Scrapper equipped, the guns they drop break down to 10 and 20 steel each, and 10 plastic for the laser weapons.  A quick run through there I had about 500 steel + all the xp.  There are even worktables in there to break the stuff down
---
The pathfinder mask is in the raiders-content bundle?
---
Yeah, the one you have to buy with money, not atoms.
---
Good level design and apocalyptic spirit. Some normal written quests with current political agenda. Normal perk system. In any part of the game you'll find really awfull bugs. Grindy, boring high-lvl content, total randomness of item drops. Bugs from start of the game. Bugs with perks, interface, quests. Most gone after relog, but it's quite hard to understand if it's a bug occured or you'r doing something wrong. At least 1 op build. Some more bugs within this build. Even more bugs with other builds. Cosmetics that were sold a year ago and you can't get them now.
---
Frankly it's not an AAA game, still a pretty nice (from art point of view) journey if you are tolerant to bugs and game mechanics that can be done in a better way.
---
super, thanks! i ask because the mask is not exactly specified as content in the bundle.
---
This!!! GL finding them for 50caps per OP. If you do find somebody, let me know
---
Thats hilarious. You should report them ,add a screenshot and request a temporary ban for them.
---
It's basically threats (it's bullshit anyway) plus online harassment. 
---
I would do it in a heartbeat and then let them know XD
---
I actually stopped having her in my camp and picked Beckett just because of that. It is literally every 10 seconds.... She has other dialogue, but it is like they made this her most frequently used option for no reason! At least slowly change it as you complete her quest line!
---
I would love to buy some. Last night my alt got the SS chest piece she's been hunting, so it's time to build a jetpack... But I need 5 Cobalt flux and 5 violet flux.
---
if y’all play PC, i got you!
---
I notice the difference on my main FH build and my second B build, in radiation rumble example, main get about 100xp from ghouls with Int about 10-12, B char gets 160xp with Int 31
---
The problem is most people can’t do end game without max builds. There are very few people who can do the simple events we have now. So unless they nerf the op builds the game will always be super easy for some and hard and shit for others. Cough bows
---
Actually on this point you're not telling anyone what players want. 
---
You've just reworded exactly what Patch 20 is bringing as your own idea.
---
Yes please, pretty please with sugar on top. Open a new region of the map with lvl 100+ mobs, give them really high perception and make it so they can kill me in one hit.
---
You know, a challenge. Regardless of build end game isn't all that hard if you know how to play.
---
It all gave me a feeling the beth put a lot more effort into the raiders.
---
Lol so need to name and shame. Will have a nuke waiting for him.
---
I Explained why, you're just either too stupid or pigheaded to read and comprehend. Your ideas suck. That simple enough to understand?
---
Gauss rifle gets stuck in animation and "shakes", which locks you out from running, reloading or using aid items. It's quite annoying, as only bashing or changing to other weapon and back solves it. 
---
First V.A.T.S. misses often, especialy on moving targets. Shame, as it makes Gauss weapons paired with small 2mm ammo craft yield greater ordeal than it should be...
---
Might be, for someone who needs that type of ammo. And it's a hypothetical question, right, as this is not a trading sub? ;-) Personally, I'm just using ultra 5mm and ultra 45mm, but 40k regular 5.56 would be just as fine (although considering how much duped ammo is still out there I should probably ask for 50k instead).
---
Start collecting troubleshooters armor pieces. If you get some to drop hold onto them and if you see some in vending machines buy them assuming they aren't crazy overpriced.  Doesn't even matter if all the pieces are leather or some other lower tier armor, just get a whole set.
---
Having a 75 percent reduction in damage from robots goes a really long way in silos.  Even suprise assaulttrons will not be able to take you down anymore.
---
You’re the one that said adding quest data effects world size 😂.        
---
          
---
Maybe you feel like your ‘explanations’ were valid. I think you dug this a little too deep. But I’d still have a beer with ya.
---
The 2 secret service armor pieces im wearing i got unyielding within the first 5 tries for both. But on the same hand I can't find a decent bloodied gun to save my life
---
They wanted to make caps a big thing for value in trades so they made it cap only trades but dupers ran that straight into the ground
---
Full auto, like plasma gun flamer, is affected by Commando perks. It's a fun weapon.. very powerfull, but duration is terrible.
---
AA FFR 250 DR for general use I'd say.
---
Can u do 15000 for the dinner knife I’m kinda short atm
---
I had him shot. no problem. fucking alcoholic.
---
No I'm not. My understanding of patch 20 is different to what I'm saying. 
---
Slightly different, but it will make a big difference to people who are actually keen on PvP.
---
I've played on off since launch. Last year I missed fasnacht, helloween and others. So some time last year I joined here to stay up to date. Every time we get new content I jump back in. Also factions has breath new life into the game for me for a while: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout76Factions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout76Factions/)
---
But A skin would be better overall so I don’t have to reroll for a perfect one
---
What are you playing on? I've had no issue on xbox.
---
The reason riding shotgun is good is there is a guaranteed 3* captain halfway through, the guy with the minigun, plus chances for more with all the spawns. Plus you can server hop and farm it.
---
   
---
It may be a mere coincidence, but the first days i got severals good pieces, uny or bolsteins with sentinel or hardest  to detect ect, but for sence long time I have noticed that it is very difficult to get pieces with uny.
---
he resets every week, and you can buy maximum of 300 gold per week i think.
---
If you're on pc use the perk loadout manager mod. If not, you better not hold your breath till its release
---
I would also say commando having tried both. 
---
Here's my current setup

---
Not fully optimised as I like the flexibility to switch things round.
---
Also fort defiance has a terminal out side with the brotherhood of steel rifle.
---
As far i know, the Chameleon effect is more like a cosmetic and doesn't bring up your stealth numbers at all. The maximum it maybe does is bringing a weaker kind of escape artist effect. The best way to max out stealth are, beside the obvious perks, wood armor pieces and a fixer. With 3-4 wood pieces you can already shoot a double barrle next to a ghoul without breaking stealth.
---
I was led to believe that the flamer barrel counted as a semi auto. I'll have to double check the numbers when I get on again
---
I was tearing up... until they went on and on and on and on. Then, I kinda wished I asked him to shoot his brother instead.
---
Can I join? Every day is Rex Manning Day, after all,
---
So no more, baby..
---
Dude hes some horny tard that needs to go outside
---
Id pass out before a world even loads lol
---
chamaleon mutation have secret perks increase your steal
---
It came out last year with the rest of the July 4th stuff.
---
Do you count creation club?
---
Gauss Shotgun hits for full potential:
---
 "Yes!"
---
Gauss Shotgun every other time: 
---
"...damn synths..."
---
Very intriguing
---
weighless increase your stealh and you can be invisible and benefist of sentinel perks, sentinel only works if you  standing still, so, if you have chamnaleon piece and you bend to be invisible, your sentinel pieces dont work, but with waighless set you can be invisible standing still and sentinel works,  either with the nerf sentinel work all pieces or none work,  so it is not as good an effect as at the beginning of the game
---
Same here! All I want is vanguard but I keep rolling unyielding, so annoying!
---
Which you can only get if you're a member of the military
---
That's awesome! Will save so much time and grind. When are you likely to be online?

My username is (silly because I didn't realise I'd ever need to share it with anyone) Knave_expiates

i must have got lucky and grabbed it before someone else.
---
virtual gold doesn't grow on servers, you know.
---
lol love it. most likely in 8 hours! which is 1pm my time
---
Ah yes, the "Green" pipboy flashlight. You'd think with Armorer or Tinkerer's workbench it'd be possible. 
---
Probably was something initially, but that would just add a bit of fun/enjoyment to the game, so it was scrapped.
---
Might as well let me change my pipe rifle to a fixer then 🙄
---
thank you for this post. Was going to get something tonight.
---
Gauss Minigun it is!!
---
Dont overlook four leaf clover in luck. Can crit n fill crit bar with the same bullet
---
Outside the load bearing event theres a terminal that you can spend them on
---
You turn them in at the terminal outside of the mine entrance in exchange for junk and some aid
---
PvP community in this game? :DDDDDDDDDD
---
She scares me a bit. Why is she amassing all those weapons and armour? I give her 2.5 guns and she gives me 1. She has so much now, she had to move to a bigger location.
---
I swear the fire/heal thing is a gimmick at best. Problem is, in close combat, the enemy (or enemies) and sometimes adjacent objects, will catch fire and unless the team has some points in the Fireproof  perk, it'll completely undo any healing. 
---
It's probably better just to add more damage to the fight. 
---
It's almost a slow regen made for out of combat, if for some reason Stimpaks weren't available.
---
Oof, if i think of the thousands of caps and hours i invested with that camp System. I wanted a true mobile camp with everything you find in a big camp. Benches, rad arch, little living area, everthing! On a single foundation, to place it easily on any surface. A project too big to ever blueprint. That was before Fo1st and its tents. This kind of thing was just trial and error for weeks. Cause even one cable or any piece of structure clipping into anything made the whole tower not replace. I got it in the end and in the process i learned more about this building system and its whacky ways than i ever wanted to know.
---
Kevduit did a similar thing where he made a gulag and it was like level 5's only, they dropped weapons and maybe have a level 0 lock they have to pick so they are both wanted so they are flagged straight away so id recommend watching that video.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ifY0gid4tU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ifY0gid4tU) There it is, btw it doesn't start straight away
---
Y'know.  I never used that
---
Then no they don't update fo4
---
Those kind of people suck, but I would advise (not that you would want to anyway) don't go into a voice chat with them. People are grabbing IP addresses and booting people offline atm on Xbox
---
You do get some idiots lmao who's he calling Bill Gates
---
Sry, i got that wrong. I was talking about the chameleon armor perk, not the mutation.
---
this is something i'v been complaining about for months, hell fallout 4 has a very popular mod MADE WITH THIS IN MIND! and thats one of the top 100 freaking mods!
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4550](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4550)  for reference.
---
i wouldn't even mind the grind as much if i could at least control SOME factor of it, with legendary perks coming soon not all armor pieces will be good for me anymore purely because of the size.
---
im rocking a heavy metal chest, right arm and leather legs but my left arm is a STURDY metal arm, which means the 5 set bonus perk is USELESS! either they need to change it to require 3 of the same armor type (since you can only wear 5 pieces total it wont be stackable) so to be less punishing or let us change the armor size of our current gear.
---
I've played this game from day 1, and IMO it was already a good game day one, with just a bit more bugs/exploits. Wastelanders sure added something, but it was fine without that.
---
What do you mean theyre stuck? As in if you glitch out of budget you cant rebuild? Or you just mean the blueprint as a whole base cant be transfered?
---
I saw this hell skape once. A door at the Whitespring that's all ways closed was open (missing) once.
---
If you consider the mindset of someone who is trying to goad you into a response, laughing at them while they do no damage and waste rounds and weapon condition (and actual time) is a pretty hilarious thing to do.
---
I'm no expert but I don't think that the different weights of armor are totally separate in the games code. Just based on what I've seen in Nukacrypt (and again, I want to emphasize how much I am not an expert on this stuff) but it seems like it might just be a tag hidden in the background. It could be as simple as changing which weight class the piece is flagged for.
---
Hopefully someone with more knowledge on the subject can actually come in and offer a better perspective. I'm only speculating based on my limited knowledge and observation.
---
technically you can report his xbox for both impersonating staff and harassment :)
---
Yep. The camp building has such limited variety, when it comes to new structures, that sets like this should never be subject to a FOMO strategy. It’s a tone-deaf move, though rotating it back into the store this soon is somewhat encouraging.
---
the probioscis and tick things for the insect repellent that do not have a spoil bar.
---
Well but with physical at least you have it twice, in FO you it wont let you use the same cosmetic twice.:D
---
This comment deserves infinite downvotes.
---
Melee is good early on to conserve ammo
---
There's plenty of mature PvPers in this game. Just because you've had a bad experience or keep hearing about these Boogeyman who go through a lot of trouble to find exploits and grief others doesn't mean there aren't people who legitimately enjoy PvPing others. 
---
If you actually read my post you'd see I have no problem making changes to help people avoid PvP, and I even offer an alternative that is functionally the same for PvE only players. But instead you had a knee jerk reaction to the words PvP and act like an emotional teenager, like you claim the entire PvP community to be.
---
If you don't care about PvP that's fine. But don't go trying to ruin it for those that do.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂Hang ups!
---
a day later, still rock solid. fuckin screamin eagles.
---
That would completely kill all sort of armor grind... except the secret service armor grind. Which is by far worse!
---
Well you're up early! That will be about 6pm UK time, so I'll be on the beach for a bit, but when I'm back I'll DM you, if you are around then great, if not, no problem.
---
i haven’t gone to sleep yet actually 😳🙃
---
Different strokes and all, but I’m kinda glad I was low level around the beginning of the game. People largely didn’t do stuff like this, and resources were jealously guarded. It gave some sense of struggle and strife to the experience (but never to intense degrees), before you hit a high enough level to be blasé about it with saying ‘guess I’ll farm x area for y today.’ 
---
Folk would still help you out sometimes in a fight, but it felt more like ‘I guess our interests align. For now,’ which was more of a wasteland kinda vibe for me.
---
Even if you don’t have pacifist on they cannot damage you unless you shoot back
---
I had a server crash as well on PC yesterday
---
Most people play the game for flux. 
---
High radiation fluid being the tough part in the process.
---
FYI that mechanic goes away in 6 days
---
Have you seen Duchass' butt? Case closed.
---
I've had the same issue, then I realised if I missed buying on the reset day, I couldn't buy again until the next reset day. It doesn't make sense and I'm sure it is a bug but I can it buy from him one day a week, and if I miss that day, I can't buy from him until the same day next week. I effectively lose a week if I miss this day.
---
Its real easy.  PvP only servers double loot . PvE only servers, no pvp unless hunter radio thing.  
---
SIMPLE
---
I often find the second star repeating like that, much more so than the first. No idea why that is though.
---
I've been avoiding her quest solely because of what I hear her say while visiting other camps lol. I'll stick with my boo Beckett.
---
Plenty of mature PvPers? :D Ok :D And care about PvP? What PvP? They destroyed PvP when they removed survival mode. PvP in this game is a complete and utter joke. And broken beyond belief. I have not seen any real PvP in this game after removal of survival mode. Just ganking by "the 14 year old kiddies with hacked ebay gear stalking low levels" in workshops etc. And i have played the game alot from launch.
---
How does that even make sense?
---
You can use the hunting rifle starting at level 1. If you look at vendors at railway stations, they will have plans for mods. One of the best mods for the hunting rifle is the "refined .50 receiver". I believe it is fairly inexpensive, and the benefits are: .50 ammo is one of the easiest/cheapest ammos you can make, and the refined .50 receiver gives the highest damage for that weapon.
---
I use the fashionable raider hat and scout mask
---
Of my drugs, that I can totally give up anytime I like no big deal, I find daytripper to be the rarest in the he wild.
---
Indeed the glitch lets you go over limit,but then you're stuck with what you did. If you want to add more items or change something,you need to use the glitch again to go over your previous extra limit.that if they don't patch it.
---
Think when its multiplicative its 30*0.2 = 6%. So it would be 36% total. Guess that 6% wont be worth it
---
did Bethesda take the slap damage out? when i first started playing they could damage you before you fought back, just in very small amounts. if they did it long enough you could die.
---

---
that would be so cool!
---
Who wants to investigate? Where my MUFONs at? Seriously though, had no idea and I have to check it out.
---
That’s really bad luck. On my first try, I wasted 400 legendary moduls on an unyielding set and got a two-star left leg. That’s it. Yesterday I gave it a try again and got my full set together. Just keep on trying :/ ... good luck!
---
Completely fair point. We usually try to make sure we wait til everyone has plenty of time to get their 1k damage. Not trying to steal rewards from people. Cuz I agree with you.
---
"This game has such a nice community intensifies"
---
But seriously, we typically wait til everyone us had time to get their damage.
---
Yes.
---
What last Quest?
---
Just unarmed melee with buffs and adrenaline
---
At that point as well. Daily scrip/treasury notes grind, events, nukes &amp; sbq runs, crafting, collecting, exploring, role-playing, building camp, helping others, etc
---
You kind of have to make your own fun at end game.
---
You have to move it once within an area that it can stay connected. So just connect power inside the dome to a conduit inside the dome on a rug. Move the rug once like 1 inch and set it back down. Only then can you move it a second time to a spot outside the dome without it breaking. Moving it over once first is the key
---
Well you've finished the story line. You can't really finish the end game. Though at 1k+ hours all in 1 toon I'm starting to feel close to finished with it haha
---
You kinda get this when the bone gobs persist after death, a low resolution bone blocks your view in first person!
---
Her HP scales with the number of people in the event. For a full server that’s probably a 10-15% health hit I’d guess. In solo, she has 32k and change and it scales up from there.
---
launching a nuke.  i get there’s still dailies but they take like five minutes. probably should have phrased it better
---
PvP keeps getting worse and worse because people like you don't care. Players with no interest in PvP push the devs to make bad changes like this and when they make PvP even worse you can just point and say "look how bad PvP is!" Yeah, well guess what? Maybe if the player base stopped supporting changes that actively made PvP worse it wouldn't keep getting worse. But that kind of logic is crazy right?
---
Survival mode wasn't the only PvP and neither is Nuclear Winter now. But you know what, if changes like this keep being made eventually it will be. How about we make PvP BETTER instead of just saying it's bad and throwing it away. Because by that logic there's a whole lot in this game that deserves to go just because it doesn't work as well as it should.
---
How about "visible mutations"...
---
Looking at you pete...
---
I mean, I’m 23, use a lever action and Fixer, and made it a rule for myself to not go after anybody that’s under level 50. But yeah, sure. Group me in with whatever you think an actual PvP community is.
---
1000 hours?!? that’s some serious dedication
---
This bug is still happening.  They won't fix it because it's not in their financial interest to fix it.  Unless - we started boycotting the game and cancelled our Fallout 1 subscriptions.  I've cancelled mine.
---
Havnt been able to get in to any other game haha
---
2-3k is huge 💪🏼 And you prob don’t have to coordinate all your food.
---
I did the reputation grind which wasn’t fun at all lol. What I do mostly is try to farm legendary weapons and armor to try and get the perfect build that fits my play style, I’m lvl 103 and I’m still trying to find most of my gear. So a lot of of events, launching nukes, and scorchbeast queen fight to farm flux and legendaries. I just hope we get the new seasons soon
---
There’s a recent game called RAD, and it puzzled me that they handled radioactive mutations better than a whole series of games focused on the post-apocalypse.
---
Noted, that’s whr I got it wrong. Will try again, thanks
---
Oh :( I am so sorry. Hearing the collectron all day must have fucked up my brain then. It seemed so Todd talking.
---
3 runs. same experience.
---
South Park not sponge bob
---
yeah the reputation grind was really boring but worth it for the guass minigun which pretty much shreds through enemies haha
---
This question come up often. Sometimes I've written out great and useful lists of things to do, but... not today. Try a search. Heaps out there. Sorry.
---
Was just making sure you where not talking about Wastelanders only, but you seem to have been around the block a few times. When I'm bored I make a new character with a different weapon setup and take things really slow.. found a lot of unique locations and stuff the 3. 4. and even 5. playthrough.
---
I pp wag
---
😂😂😂This reads like it’s been written by a very salty, petulant teenager themselves. Referencing sexual orientation is certainly very mature of you!
---
I recommend tadpole/possum badges.. that should keep you entertained for a while 🤯
---
Make friends and bonds so you can miss them when there not online anymore.
---
Basically this. It’s like Bethesda just completely removing camps because you can’t place down blueprints on flat ground because its “floating.” Completely removing the base of a problem isn’t a fix. It’s like amputating at the elbow for a paper cut on the finger.
---
Fairly, one of my toons is blooded melee and the highest I got was 4.5k but I didn’t factor in adrenaline tbh. Thanks I look at that!
---
I know I just rolled a bloodied gauss mini a couple days ago, it’s my new favorite weapon for the SBQ fights. But that damn gun guzzles ultracite ammo so I’m constantly farming crimson flux
---
that’s ok!
---
fair enough. that’s a really good idea, thanks!
---
I like her too.  Although reminds me so much of star wars for some reason
---
FWIW, here is my queen build:

Go to scorched earth, it always rewards flux
---
Haven’t played in a few months, what’s this about tents that made the guy so upset?
---
No, you're 14 and you bought a mini nuke machine gun off eBay. Apparently I'm also 14, although I have no recollection of even having an eBay account and I can't seem to find any of my duped/hacked gear. /s
---
Seriously though, I'm not active in any PvP discord or Facebook communities, but I see players advertise them all the time. People definitely do like PvP and a good deal like a respectable fair fight. I'll admit I don't mind an easy kill if they're dropping some tasty loot, but I don't like going after low levels and it's 100% more fun when the other side fights back and offers a challenge. Even if I'm getting my ass handed to me, so long as it's not because of broken weapons or exploits it's still a lot of fun!
---
ooh that would be a challenge 
---
thanks!
---
Definitely wanted this - eg. the way you look when you exit PA and the model doesn't reform the correct way.
---
That is a good plan, you should set up near the camp where they join so it just falls into place.
---
nice!
---
yeah it goes through so much ammo
---
Pete said some would be visible, where tho ?
---
Overdrive and psychotats.
---
Even better.  However I am conflicted.
---
PvP
---
I wish I was 14 again! 😂😂😂
---
Report one of the more explicit messages and he'll instantly catch a 24 hour communication ban, then use the Xbox app on your phone and send 200 lols back to him
---
It’s weird because most of the time I find fallout is a generally nice environment (at least in comparison to other similar games like sea of thieves etc) but you get the occasional asshole who insists on stealing and killing people and just being plain toxic, and don’t get me wrong it’s part of the game to do that, but some people do it.... persistently and unnecessarily let’s say, with OP guns and just won’t back down. I had this level like 350 continuously attack my CAMP and all my workshops, who clearly had enough kit to sink a ship and didn’t need the caps or resources but just wanted to engage in PvP. After a while i message him telling him to leave me alone and he replied with i’ll f your mum and lol level 100 you’re so sh*t noob etc. Eventually we just left the server which was annoying bc there was four of us all doing different things... and then the guy litERALLY FOLLOWED US ONTO A NEW SERVER. There’s such a range of people on the server like whenever someone stops by my camp and uses the vending we leave them little goodie bags of Meds ie purified water, food, stimpak and any spare drugs we have going as we don’t tend to use them.
---
I sell for between 250-350 and get cleaned out all the time.  It's a pain to farm as mobs don't drop a lot of high radiation fluids.
---
Same problem with my handmades.
---
Got a JE laser?
---
There is a way to do it, but then you’d have to tweak the Fallout76.ini file and make sure you have the right color codes.
---
You might wanna check up on the meaning of butt buddies.
---
Yeah, even if you’ve done the quest, when you go in use the terminal to activate the waiting room announcer, you’ll hear the speech.
---
Exactly my thoughts. Although with this games history (removing Survival mode and Vault Raids) they really are more likely to just remove it from the game. 
---
There's a lot of great ideas floating around to make PvP better for both sides of the spectrum, but the problem is the PvE only community seems to refuse to get behind any of them. Maybe if they offered more support the devs would actually dedicate some resources to fixing PvP. It baffles me that they haven't considering the game is starving for content and PvP is one of the easiest ways to keep players engaged with your game that doesnt immediately get stale, provided it's done with some attention.
---
Don’t need too! Been on this earth long enough to know what it means your implication. You need to go and check it yourself! 😀😀
---
Nope o: sorry, you have an extra?
---
When you stand on high ground, like on top of a tent, the SBQ won't land, she just does acid piss flybys for ages. It makes killing her near impossible.
---
What you're experiencing is when they've tweaked how much budget certain items take up. It does not increase with level, it's been proven by data miners.
---
I’m approaching 2k hours and still play daily.
---
Man, I wish I had contacts in the gaming industry like these guys.. 🤣
---
This is false.  SBQ does not scale to the amount of people.
---
I started a new character and this would be perfect
---
Ah right! I am surprised you have minimum in Endurance but I guess you rely on getting the first hit in to deal devastating damage first? I know on my build I have 7 Endurance and take a few hits in bloodied build but nowhere near the damage your getting. So stacking as much as possible will get better damage then?
---
I forget but it was around 6-7 in the burrows.
---
Please point me to a link.  I can't seem to find anything other than opinion.
---
I'm ~2300 hrs in and haven't touched end game much.
---
My wife is almost 3k hrs.  
---
We play all night, almost every night on xbox since the beginning.  
---
There's enough to keep a player busy if they are ludicrous enough.
---
OP doesn't need it, they have Limb Damage on this bad boy!
---
What they could do is with the public teams, make one of the options for them be PvP. Once there’s two teams of that, all PvP restrictions go out the door like in Survival. And then add in some Hunter/Hunted so you have to search an area for the other team. I dunno, that sounds like a good middle ground for everything.
---
You have an image how does it look like?
---
Just hope someone nukes an area like Whitespring with lots of ghouls to farm those components.
---
I agree.  I just got rid of Daguerre after her questline.  Settler Wanderer because of her incessant guitar playing (And the same damng chord every time too) and the "Pull my Finger" guy.
---
Raider Punk's my default because he isn't annoying to me yet.  I've got to go grab Beckett too.
---
I rolled one with vats hit chance. Seems to help a lot. Still sometimes does as your saying , but less.
---
Recipes would be great. There are a few I don't have yet. (Also maybe chef hats?)
---
I’m at the same point. I’ve been working on doing a heavy/commando build so I can use both weapon types and testing it out with the SBQ. Also I’m working on levelling up, so doing lots of XP runs.
---
Yeah my last stealth character used a recon, silenced, 50 cal hunting rifle..... And a silenced pump shotgun. Pretty much both covered all situations, mostly. Scortchbeat Queen still needed a legendary handmade to do enough damage quickly for drops, but otherwise these took everything else down effectively.
---
I eventually found a decent legendary pump shotgun, but it's difficult to find a decent legendary hunting rifle, for me anyway.
---
Lol. This might actually be a thing. On my full health junkies build I rolled almost a full suit of Unyield on 10 modules.   
---
On my bloodied commando I’ve gotten about 3 Unyield out of almost 100 modules and a bunch of decent full health armor.  
---
Im actually debating on swapping those toons around.
---
Something scales. If it’s not her actual HP, then it’s Halle Ong behind the curtain. When I solo her with my fixer, I can kill her in 3-4 mags. When I shoot her with the same 3-4 mags doing the same damage, in a full server, it barely touches her health. So if not HP, it’s happening through DR or through something else we can’t see.
---
Glad to hear that, I'm about to get him next, and Raider Punk's the most tolerable camp person I have right now.
---
First, stock up on Nukashine, 
---
2nd, find the "haunted" and/or mysterious places places in fo76
---
3rd use the few minutes before the blackout to investigate the Appalachia X-files. 
---
Nukashine and Vintage Nukashine act differently in different areas. (Weird colors go from the average blue and violet, to Red/Yellow/Black like Pickman's paintings in Fo4)
---
Weird stuff. 
---
Oh, and Becareful when you encounter a "child"... unfavorited items go missing.
---
Been trying to figure out this Nukashine Dreamwalker stuff for a bit now.
---
Yeah i read that , they dont stack i assume ?
---
Lol why? What is going on lately everyone seems to be really sensitive lately
---
I miss Jet
---
Suppose this could be a real help if your farming legendaries for scrip! 👍 Cheers
---
isn't it sold at Camden park for tokens?
---
Nah, you just need one effect and you're good to go. I'm gonna experiment tonight with the Armor, to see if it also works with fast fire rate heavy weapons. Last nights project was Gauss Shotguns, and it was a great time! HeHe.
---
Straight from the horses mouth bud - https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bxmlkb/psa_camp_does_not_increase_with_level_period_end

I enjoy pvp but don't like it with legacy weapons. I would love to meet enough like minded players to host 4v4 on private. But I know too few people that don't use legacies. So far it's just myself and and one friend that play daily , and two others that play sporadically.
---
It’s currently broken. The flanes themselves do nothing to heal allies. You need to hit them with the weapon for it to work, aka gun bashing with the flamer. At this point you’re better of using a shishkebab with faster swing speed + martial artist. The amount you heal isn’t that much either,  but it’s useful to heal npcs like the project paradise animals.
---
Although, I haven’t heard of anyone trying friendly fire and a flaming chainsaw yet - maybe this would be the best combination.
---
It's a nice guarantee at a legendary for mumbles' misery locker. No probs!
---
Sounds like you've never gotten a good drop before. Hopefully yours will come soon. May I recommend playing the game instead of trolling people's posts?
---
Would be nice if they fixed it, that way people might actually have a chance of getting rewards from the SBQ. Very much approved :)
---
Honestly, I just wish they'd make light, sturdy, and heavy all cosmetic options rather than stat ones.  The way things are right now, there's no reason not to have the heaviest version of an armor the one to wear by default.  
---
Especially at higher levels where things do so much damage.  No one's really thinking "Oh hey, I should wear light / sturdy armor so I can take MORE damage."
---
Tbh, all tables(large and small)/workbenches/shelving units that are in the game now should be able to hold stuff.
---
Well at least it’s to improve quality and not that they are not ready as usual.
---
Thanks but someone else has already corrected me in a comment thread.
---
I’ve almost got a complete set, and I’m rocking a troubleshooting war-drum with 50% limb damage and a faster swing speed. It was a little stressful because I’m not really used to melee
---
Ill just shoot myself with a gamma gun
---
Check your misc item tab for anything unusual.
---
Endurance is not really a need for me at all. With SS armor there’s a ton of defense, and for non queen build I run full barbarian, evasive, dodgy, serendipity, blocker etc. and you become a tank.
---
I have the same issue on PS4, I've only ever bought bullion twice from Smiley weeks ago, for the past 2 weeks I've not been able to buy any.
---
I think so, but am waiting for the seedy shack to show up again.  I'm kicking myself for not getting it last time.
---
I wish they had a webstore outside of the game where old stuff was available to buy (even at full price) all of the time.
---
Nah it should be a separate mode, the change is good
---
wow!
---
But all the doors look the same I swear it’s like the overlook hotel of fallout
---
What level would you suggest for starting the order of the tadpole quests?
---
i suck at PvP so i don’t do it much otherwise i definitely would!
---
Or they should balance low health builds/full health builds. Unyielding is too OP.
---
Yes... SS armour I have that in my rifle build it’s made a difference. Still running unyielding cav + Str combat and marine armour! Need to build the gold and try for those rolls😂😂😂
---
Until the cash cow produces nought but dust.
---
Pretty cool right?
---
It's the new arrow to the knee.
---
How do you get these? I can never figure it out what I need to do lol
---
Agreed. Never been much of a heavy VATs user, but i felts like its almost essential for all characters,just like many other  buggy, badly explained things, I was thinking maybe it helps damage etc outside VATs.
---
Great idea, give em 20 years to implement it.
---
If you have pacifist turned on and they are at your base, if you have turrets set up for defense, do your turrets trigger against players that attack you, or are they only program to go after AI enemies?
---
:D İ like heavy guns, especially .50cal is awesome, especially with some legendaries! And it fits my often over-encumbered play-style. Crouch and rain bullets.
---
There is that too... I mean they said in 2 years we would be able to walk to the capital wasteland, at the original E 3 reveal. That is in 5 months.
---
How do you get the pails
---
Me too, but some "free" sets (although they cost caps) like the Brick Building set and the Barn building set can look pretty nice.  Especially if you buy the right doors.
---
Brick's very popular with people who don't have the contemporary building set.  I use it myself.
---
Morgantown....all of those Mutfruit plants by Mama Dolce’s become cobalt.
---
I agree.  Don't think I'll be able to afford it this time around, and think that set should be available year round, honestly.  It's good enough for people to get, even at full price.
---
His mum probably didnt allow him to get fallout 1st
---
This change is being put in because of the new teams system. It would be plagued with griefers without it, and be DOA. 
---
It seems like Bethesda is finally pushing this game towards a multilayer co-op focus over its original intended pvp focus. Which is great for a lot of long time FO fans, because nearly every fan of the series wanted a FO they could play with their buddies. People seem to forget that until 76, FO was single player pve only. Its only logical that fans of the series who wanted multilayer, wanted it to be co-operative over pvp oriented. At least the majority of them, I never once talked about being able to pvp in FO with anyone. But I've always seen discussions and requests about being able to play with your friends.

Pvp doesn't have to be removed from this game, but it also doesn't need to be a focus. A refined duel type system in Adventure mode is plenty generous for a FO game. There's 1 billion other titles with a much better pvp experience and much more balanced gameplay. Is it really the end of the world if FO doesn't fall into that category of games?
---
You say changes shouldn't improve for one group at the cost of another, but pvp crybabies are the reason that TSE was nerfed into oblivion in Jan. 2019. No pvp people were bitching about that nerf, but pve players lost their most powerful high health meta build. In a game that offers pve and pvp and the two aren't kept completely separated, changes to one will almost always cause negative effects in the other. Its one of the biggest problems Destiny has had since its launch.
---
Finally, the "hate" towards pvp is always funny to read or hear. Its not always necessarily hate towards actual pvp, its a immense disapproval of the way most pvp players chose to play. So many players enjoy baiting others into pvp and then griefing them as much as possible. Players used to just seek out camps and destroy them without any consequence. Workshops are supposed to be fought over for the workshop itself, but its really just some dickhead showing up for the sole purpose of killing the owner as many times as they can. Teams are used to bait people into pvp to guess what, grief them. The most toxic part of the entire 76 playerbase comes from the pvp group. 
---
The rest of us just want to play the series we love with our friends
---
The whole point to every dlc and patch has been away to keep people playing longer the legendarys perks are no different.  There looking at the the bloodied biulds where guys stopped grinding cuz they have full unyielding already, but now they have to grind a full unyielding of the same type
---
This, plus just cause it says it does something doesn't mean it does.  Find a gutsy and test it yourself.
---
I dont see why anyone likes pvp, hell i already think NW pvp sucks. But i do respect other peoples choices, so a specific pvp area or lobby would be good.
---
Not yet no.
---
I someguy got mad when I contested posiedon. Being built just up the road is was very conscious of what could happen. Luckily when I got back to my base I found my Deathclaw flinging him around like a ragdoll.
---
The game was fine at launch, it hasn't changed much and still has most of the bugs.  It has a new story and feel , mostly the jerks left and only died hards are left.
---
100% this.
---
"Never quite cared for it."
---
Perfect. Thank you!
---
That doesn't make sense at all the whole point of unyielding is your health is super low but you do alot of damage, while vanguards makes it so you do less damage but barley get a starch.  That seem pretty balanced to me you just have to choose between damage or DR
---
not gonna say it aint cool but that sir a house not a camp lol.
---
On my 2nd day of playing fo76 I saw this glitch and thought it was actually how mutations made you look.  Disappointed when I found out otherwise tbh
---
Isn't there a reset timer on that?
---
Truth hurts so it must be trolling then? :D
---
Agreed I used to love ark pve but all the nerfs everything took due to pvp people crying made the game a bit hollow as it just turned into who can find the best hole/tower and put up loads of turrets.
---
If you have already conpleted the quest you have to wait until the next day but if you haven't completed it you can change the quest as many times as you like
---
I usually take my normal weapon loadout and also pull a vampires handmade out of my stash just for silos.  When I get face lasered I just quickly switch to the vampires and use it to refill my health and kill the assaulttron at the same time.  Never have to use a single stimpack.
---
Who says I stopped grinding because I have full unyielding, I still need decent ones, a couple of them are 1* leather!
---
Very cool!
---
Charisma is a dump stat tbh. So out it at like 2 for lone wonderer. In my opinion a high strength, intelligence, and luck are the best for a melee/heavy. Intelligence for durability of weapons and bloodied and luck for bloodied, mutations, and bloodied mess perks. Hope that helps.
---
I had some problems with food and water 'spawn' rates not matching up with what I was able to collect at the begining of the game and put in some tickets. After some back and forth in a support ticket, this is what I was told, and it seems to be true when I tested it.
---
For planted crops or purified water, the per hour for production is across all of your combined crops or water NOT as individuals. So for simplicity sake, lets say that the math works out to every 4 minutes you get 1 proc. It's not per each crop/water purifier as you would think if you just went by the display text in your camp; its combined over all. So if you have 5 crops and you harvest them all at once, one will randomly regrow every 4 minutes, so those 5 crops will take 20 minutes NOT all crops will regrow every 4 minutes. If you have 20 plants it will take 80 minutes for all 20 to have a crop on it. Same with water, you will get 1 proc every 4 minutes, randomly into any of your purifiers until they are full.
---
Hopefully that makes sense.
---
Bethesda knows about it, its slowly been spreading since it happened. Over time more and more posts are put up about how it just happened to them one day with no common denominator But as far as i know Bethesda hasn’t said much about which glitches patch 20 will and wont fix
---
Well, seems I'm wrong, so uncursed you 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Head up to the scout camp fairly early (say level 15, or a bit lower if you're feeling brave) just to get the quests activated, even if you don't actively work on them yet. That way if you happen to come across another player needing a revive you can get that requirement done - I happened to get it just in a random blood eagle camp where somebody got downed.
---
I completed the last quest months ago but I am not even close to "completed it mate" 
---
Trading 
---
Farming legendaries 
---
Farming script 
---
Farming rare items from events
---
The Queen and her crappy loot.
---
Farming rep with both factions 
---
Farming gold for the T65 power armour / secret service armour
---
Or just go exploring, stop using fast travel and run the whole map. You will be surprised at some of the things you find.
---
Months of stuff to do. Tedious at times yes but still stuff to do off the top of my head.
---
Do they still spawn with them? I kept an AR and laser on one character. Don’t use the laser but the AR non-legendary is about equivalent to an AA legendary at close range, and blows it away as range increases.
---
Check your challenges on the menu. They're listed in there.
---
Individual servers seem to favour giving certain prefixes. Once when I was farming private I was getting loads and loads of bloody weapons over and over (they were all crap unfortunately).
---
You can get a little feel for what legendary types might drop by doing some farming before spending the scrip. You need to farm quite a bit to figure it out though as it still has the full prefix table to pick from, just the chance of each seems to be different across each server.
---
Just lemme turn into a ghoul ffs
---
I think the heart was supposed to be symbolic, not just something random they threw in.
---
Make your own game then
---
Yeah. No slap damage anymore.
---
i don’t know if this is still a thing but I got a pre owned copy from gamestop for eleven dollars or so.
---
“American will never fall to communist invasion.”
---
“Obstruction detected.”
---
Slap damage has been gone for at least a year IIRC (a long time either way)
---
You should visit duchess on my worlds, I sell all my drugs to her and surprisingly I come across that one a lot. 
---
It was addictol I found hard to come across and ironically when I did get addicted to psychotats that one time, I kicked the habit and got addicted to the addictol instead.
---
the stealth multiplier doesn't work if your target is in combat. unless they fixed it, this is something people hilariously miss all the time when complaining about how "op" sneak is.
---
Someone's never played a Bethesda game before 👀
---
Already tried that. They just sent me it back, used.
---
Pair it with max life giver perk and healing factor and ur almost god like.   Just keep moving.
---
Only way to make pvp better would be to fix the one shot builds. Make it a real fight not just I hit u once and u died. But that would mean nerfing the op builds and people would get really mad
---
Yeah, a fair point. They do love their Stealth multipliers.
---
I dunno you could just...not crouch.
---
I have no room to talk, I run a stealth build, and yeah it's overpowered. Fun, but overpowered to the point it trivializes most content.
---
There is a really good enclave one where the plans spawn in a shack near Tanagra town if you haven't gotten it already. Something urban operative underamor (sheilded maybe, can't remember).  Gives +3 Str and +2 per.   It's behind a door with a password but there are videos to show you how to get it.  Takes like 4 violet flux to craft though so not really feasible to mass produce and sell.  You need to buy the underamor from modus and then mod it but that is cheap.
---
Yeah. Fun, but after a while it's like dang.
---
But the RNG!
---
True, add bloodied to it and it really is dang!
---
I'm sure at some point the aliens will be the focus of a yearly expansion of roughly Wastelanders size.
---
Yeah, that's my build. Using the Unstoppable Monster and it's like bro, dang.
---
I have a question as well. After expiration does the Mothman emote become unavailable?
---
Or just have only one point in Sneak. No Escape Artist.
---
I find if you lose some damage perks and drop the bloodied weapon, instead of going balls deep into stacking the damage it makes it slightly less OP.
---
Like people fresh from the Vault?
---
PvP is adventure mode should be gone. 
---
Make PvP modes with preset loadouts.   Some type of capture the flag mode or control points.
---
But then it won't be like bro, dang bro. Ya know? Dang.
---
I have never longed for an Atomic Shop item as much as the Thanksgiving display case. Or any item that would even be similar. I literally would purchase immediately.
---
Yeah you can restrict yourself to make it harder. I think I might just roll a character with 8's across the board and see how it goes. Would be much hardy to min max then.
---
Basically you have Paints and Skins.
---
Paints are just textures on the existing PA parts. No model change, they're limited to specific PA models - see Blackbird, the BoS ranking paints, the plain colours, etc.
---
Skins are model changes and can be applied to any PA piece -  see Red Rocket, Liberty Prime, etc.
---
It's not balanced because Unyielding has access to lots of perks that make it much harder to die (Nerd Rage, Serendipity etc.), but high health builds don't get equivalent synergies to increase their damage.
---
The other main issue is that dying is such a non-issue in the game that there's not really a downside to dying. You drop your junk which you can pick up again and that's it, so why not run a build that doubles your damage compared to anything high-health builds can do? You might be mildly inconvenienced once in a while by dying but most of the time you can tank it with the perks or kill stuff before it sees you anyway.
---
I prefer handmade over fixer. But with that said. 
---
If ur a big vats user then the Fixer.  
---
Like shooting outside of vats.  Handmade.
---
Weed
---
I legitimately had a friend "phone a friend" to help get the gamertag I reported featuring the unicode swastika in their name removed.
---
I call her Mama Murphey.
---
It has its own category but I’m not sure where to identify whether it’s heavy or not
---
Default walking is crouch walking and normal walking is for towns lol
---
Being the only armor that you'll need, no.
---
Yes. Absolutely this.
---
You’re right about that. I just wanted to ask and make sure what would be better that is not explosive.
---
Awesome, glad you got it working. Keep in mind you can use almost any floor item and a conduit, or any wall item and a wall conduit, and it will work the same way. Good luck with your future camp wiring!
---
Ope, 'scuse me, kid.
---
The ability to transfer characters leads to a ridiculous imbalance though. When anyone just bring legacies, duped quantums, and the god roll armor sets into PvP it becomes a total mess of an experience. I personally think survival should have required new characters that would be locked to survival mode. That way everyone starts off on the same playing field from day 1
---
It can't be the same girl, since those holotapes in 76 are clearly fictional, and even if they weren't, Sally in Mothership Zeta was kidnapped just after the war.
---
Death it is then
---
What system are you on?
---
Also have him spit in his food. How dare he pit his tent on the ground. 😂
---
Not accepting Caps but check my previous post for a gigantic list of things i might, or might not, be willing to trade!
---
AA is better all around, bit the Trouble Shooters could be worth keeping for silos and Encryptid.
---
This!
---
It's not classified as anything in the current game. But it's classified as heavy in the PTS, so this is what I'd expect it to be for legendary perk purposes.
---
Fallout 76.2 now with slightly less bugs
---
“tHE 76 cOmMuNiTy iS tHe BeStEsT!”
---
I have a hard time believing they're trying to make the franchise "more serious" after they created &gt;!an Assaultron who's whole purpose was to have sex with a Sheepsquatch. !&lt;
---
no it's light.
---
The title describes Bethesda games in general, tbh
---
That's why devs should have added a public team for pvp as well.
---
Nope, only the Flamer, Shishkebab and Molotov have the required keyword, and since you can't hit someone with a Molotov, it's just Flamer bashing and the Shishkebab.
---
In this game PvP is more puzzle than actual combat skills - at least up until you're able to beat 90% of players without effort. All about your perk cards.
---
I noticed she had a fat ass the other day lol
---
When you say text chat do you mean Xbox messages?
---
Yea that does it. I need the mobility... but damn it would nice of them to at least double the budget.
---
I'm a long time fan a want pve and pvp even more
---
I’d love to stop by and peruse. Add me Getbust3d
---
Xbox
---
1. The heal for the perk is small, barely noticeable honestly. There's a delay between "procs" too, so while continuous fire would heal, it wouldnt be a seamless heal. Also, its currently bugged and not working for the flamer unless you bash them which is ridiculous lol.
---
2. Faster fire rate is the only effect that benefits this perk.
---
3. Team Medic is by far the most reliable and effective support perk in the game. Friendly Fire is a gimmick. I would recommend Team Medic any day of the week.
---
4. Field Surgeon in Charisma pairs well with Team Medic + First Aid. That triple perk combo is all you need to be a "support" in my book. Though supports generally aren't needed to begin with.
---
That’s an interesting one but I’m super picky with paints lol, I just hope they come out with plenty more, so there’s some sort of option
---
I did it at level 30 and got backpacks unlocked at around 40 or so
---
I don’t know, they keep putting only paints back up on the market , and they have models for the armor, so they could add it in
---
Even in the Wasteland, HOAs are still a pain in the ass
---
Yea I guess people would never want any other three star armour if it isn't unyielding..
---
Delete game cache.
---
Also rebuild database.
---
EZ Pete also said Fallout 4 did not have vehicles because the map was "too small". What's the excuse this time, I wonder?
---
Aye fuck yes!!!
---
If you ever feel like learning about it more - lemme know. I try to teach builds and help new pvpers reach whatever goals they have for themselves in game. 👍
---
No it hasn't, I know from irl friends 2 dupes and 1 hack that have been fully reported and still work over a year later, bugthesda just patched the all over YT dupes that's it.  Dude the game is never going to be there. The dev's who actuality do the work and care about the game are kneecaped by corporate min max money team here ya fix those servers with a stick and mud but sure in your spare time you can fix that shit customers complain about. 
---
The corp side doesn't care were numbers they expect customer losses there only goal is did they get there money outa us first and can they bring in new customers. When they can't sections modes of game or the entire game closes.
---
Go talk to the lady in the bar, her name is dutches I think.
---
Then comeback to him.
---
That should fix the problem.
---
Huh, I figured everyone had that revolver discount lol. Good to know!
---
I think its heavy based on the PTS data. We should be getting description tags that tell us which one in a future update.
---
Tbh I don't run any points in sneak and i very rarely get detected, seems like a waste to me.  
---
I'm yet to find myself in a situation where i thought to myself gee i wish i didn't get detected there!
---
People don’t hate pvp, people hate scams and that’s the only thing most of the so-called ‘pvpers’ do in FO76.
---
Mutation: Third Arm
---
Effects: 
---
Positive: Increased Heavy Weapon Accuracy, 10 extra carry capacity.
---
Negative: Sprinting takes more AP, Agility - 2
---
I can't get a daily quest from my ally. The wanderer likes to talk a big game while wandering my camp, but that's all she does. No quests for like a week so far.
---
Just for the flux of it
---
I use a mining helmet and changed the color to red (tactical light). Having your light on head-level feels more immersive than the pip boy based lightning imo.
---
HaHa, that's a new one, Bumass... Is that like a Williedick or a Boobtit?
---
Or maybe respond to emotes!
---
With pvp not really a thing this is how the griefers have their fun.
---
I'd drop endurance to 5 so you can still use full ironclad.
---
Intelligence to 5.
---
Charisma to 4.
---
Then just put those points into Agility or Luck.
---
And yet people say PC needs text chat 🙄 No thanks, I'm fine with the 👍, 👎, 👋, 🤷♂️ and ♥️, says all I've ever needed to say.
---
I've been having that bug too. A couple times it was fixed by removing her chair and placing it back again but it's pretty inconsistent
---
I'm in.
---
Thank you for the heads up.
---
Did U hear Skyrim was announced for ps5
---
Hasty .50 is my personal favorite. It has 90% of the damage of a hardened receiver, but faster firerate, reload and AP cost.
---
Ah, shame.
---
I’m 111 and kind of running out of stuff to do. What the hell are you still doing each play session?
---
Unstable Isotope and Electrically Charged have visible effects. I think this is what was being referenced.
---
No probs! If tgat doesn't work I suggest switching allies, then server hopping. It's a pain in the ass but it'll be fixed in the next update, I think
---
i spend a lot of time toggling in and out of vats, vats...quit vats, vats again = better shot!  using r and again just to run or reload. seriously broken. vats usage seems to effect full charge; weapon shake without actually charging. the pistol is exactly the same.
---
The Frothman Poarth!
---
I might try without sneak perk then and see what happens.
---
Berry Mentats.👍😁
---
I can never have enuf Berry Mentats 😍😍
---
That's what ESO does with it's ESO+ exclusive deals. It would clear up a lot of confusion.
---
I think I'll just switch allies. I haven't tried the raider punk yet.
---
You just met the ambassador of the ‘pvp community’.
---
but the point is dragging out content is fine as long as ITS DONE RIGHT, i'v played my fair share of onlines, when i can control what i get to an extent i have fun grinding.
---
but when i have to purely leave it to RNG it sucks, will i get a 3star item i actually can utilize or will i get the wrong weapon with the stats i wanted or will i get the right armor with the right traits but because its light i cant use it for my heavy set.
---
part of why MMO's have enchanting features, gear "buffs" and vendors you can buy stuff from with currency over time is to compensate the player for their time.
---
WoW as an example removed the vendor function in their last expansion and left it purely to RNG, it was rated their worst expansion because some people would get lucky and be fully geared in a week, others could still be searching even now because of bad RNG
---
I've always made my camp rather small for decorating reasons. I see all these bog camps but they look so empty. (unless they glitch the camp budget)
---
You'll get sick of his voice exercises pretty soon but apart from that he's not too bad. My personal fave is the forager
---
A griefer raided your camp and flattened it most likely
---
actually the lighter armors mean less weight which factors into stealths invisible stat, which is why people in power armor dont get close for their sneaks but people in wood can go melee because wood with its default shadowed mod and the weightless trait actually allows it to have 0 weight and work with chameleon resulting in the best stealth of all, i mean seriously you can tickle a scorch beasts bum with it, especially if you use high agility and a stealth boy
---
Do you want straight up Ballistic resistance, Energy resistance, mix?
---
I think it's Heavy Metal for Ballistic, Heavy Leather for Energy, and Heavy Combat, Scout, or if you've got the Plans - Secret Service, for mix.
---
thanks.  yeah ive done that.  the quest are grayed out for life
---
I worked so hard for this DREAM! I run a shotgun build and was so sad when I finally dumped a ton of modules to get a half decent roll, only to find out that because it is so inconsistent, I can't reliably trust it to do what a gun should be able to do, at bare minimum... Things like... shooting? Or.... Reloading? On 4 different SBQ fights, I got STUCK in the sights! Like even opening the map, I'd still be looking through my shotgun scope. I have a B/E Combat shotty, and that baby almost never lets me down... I went back to the bread and butter. Almost 2 months of work for a gun that really is broken.
---
Secret Service armor. The one you get with gold bullion.
---
Scorchbeast if a had to guess
---
No, you can't built atomic shop items in others camps
---
Depending on your location, a guy that don't like your camp could lead some monsters or enemies to your camp which will destroy it.
---
If you or you team don't made any pvp fights, this can be on reason.
---
Buttressed Secret Service with bullion and legendary modules should be your goal
---
until then it depends on your play style. If you're ranged you can have less DR than if you're running a shotgun or melee. 
---
I used the chinese stealth suit for ages when i got it as it is very sneaky. I still carry it now incase i need rad resistance.
---
You should check out the #[F76OneByOne](https://twitter.com/hashtag/F76OneByOne) hashtag on twitter. A number of players made themed CAMPS on only one foundation. It's a pretty fun experiment, though I'm not sure I'd want to live there permanently.
---
correct, as the mod i mentioned in the highest upvote post its a "mod" slot that dictates if its heavy, sturdy or light, the mod just allows you to craft them and swap them out
---
It starts here:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Order\_of\_the\_Tadpole](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Order_of_the_Tadpole) 
---
and you can check progress in challenges -&gt; world -&gt; possum
---
I make SS armor pieces whenever I have enough scrip to buy 10 modules. I got at least one 3-star Unyielding piece on the first batch for every piece.... Until I got to the right leg. I've done 6 batches of right leg and not even a 1-star Unyielding.
---
Define "best". Best over-all protection? Secret Service armor. But this currently has neither deep-pocketed nor ultra-light mods on the limbs, so if you want the carry weight bonus or the AP,  heavy BOS combat armor or polymer scout armor is still the way to go.
---
One of my characters uses a completely mobile camp. It’s not just one building though. It’s a few 1x1 buildings I can plop down anywhere that hold my vendors and all crafting and a bed.
---
ok thanks!
---
Daddy-O and Day Tripper are the two that I'll usually buy in vendors. The rest are easy enough to come by. I'll also buy up psychobuff if I'm running low because I burn through so much of that stuff. And of course Berry and Grape Mentats are always nice too.
---
Usually I'm not a fan of people who abuse the term "harassment", but in this case it definitely applies.
---
Now you've done it! I'm his friend who works at Microsoft and I am deleting your account as we speak! You'll pay for what you've done.
---
It counts as sturdy.
---
As others have said, scrap all the things first and foremost. No reason not to now. Personally I leave my tent down in the bog for SBQ fights or flux farming when someone nukes fissure prime, it also gives me free fast travel from the north where my camp is located. 
---
Yes you can use private servers to transfer between characters. I use the unlimited weight suitcases in train stations for my stuff. Just be careful not to accidentally login to adventure when you're doing this though or you WILL lose all the stuff. I also wouldn't take long to switch characters just to be safe, I've yet to lose anything myself but I have heard stories of people losing expensive legendaries and items doing it.
---
I use a Tesla rifle in a lot of events and get the perks of seeing the "Pacifist mode enabled..." message because it likes to arc to nearby players. Getting wanted for this, or proximity explosions from explosive weapons or grenades or even something as simple as a someone running in front of you while you shoot something; That would truly suck.
---
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE NEEDS ME TO KICK THEIR ASS!
---
The best non secret service set you can get is a mixed set. Heavy metal arms, heavy leather legs, and a heavy combat chest
---
Happens to me a lot, it usually happens when 2 different accounts play on the console. My error goes away after an hour or two of trying and then leaving it for a bit. Then going in later
---
I’ve seen when youre in the game and it says “press and button to continue”, dont press anything. Just wait a min and a half and then press. Its weird ik, but it works for me. Other than that is prolly a game delete and redownload
---
Scout armor for the win! No rare plans to learn, all mods available any time for caps, and no light, sturdy or heavy to worry about. And the stats are for all intents and purposes the same as BOS Heavy Combat armor.
---
Folks have been using explosive bait to destroy camps and not get wanted from it. It should not work that way but the bait has been glitched. Likely these same folks were using it to stop the Fasnacht Parade during that event also.
---
But for how long
---
It really depends what you mean by best. The secret service armor is probably the best overall armor for DR/ER/RR, after that the legendary options are down to what you find the most useful to your build.
---
Plenty of other good armours though, heavy brotherhood of steel combat armor and polymer scout armor are both great. Chinese stealth suit for sneaking/nuke zones.
---
How do you know it wasn't nuked ? A complete destruction is normally a nuke, where is it located?
---
It's possible for someone to lead something to it like a scorch beast but generally location dependent it won't be completely destroyed.
---
How did you know that?
---
Absolutely need this, and to be able to convert armour into different armour, although at the cost of legendary modules or gold bullion maybe
---
Why would they add PvP servers to a game when it's obvious they majority of their players don't want PvP? They're just going to remove all PvP from adventure mode completely and leave whatever the abomination BR mode is as it is.
---
I don‘t think that‘s a good way. Don‘t know how many times I hit someone accidentally while trying to help shooting at a mob of enemies or while fighting the Queen. Getting the wanted status just for that?
---
I‘m good how it is now. Turned on the pacifist mode and ignoring everyone that is shooting at me 👍🏻
---
Depends what you like, I find small camps cramped and crowded, I have only seen a few smaller camps well done, but rare. I have a friend who likes to build and decorate but I am always finding I am bumping into things, it's just a different style but I am the opposite and pretty more empty ..
---
And high luck makes it do ....things....
---
I appreciate the response. The whole thing is weird to me. Makes me want to create an alt just to test this out.
---
&gt;Gauss rifle gets stuck in animation and "shakes", which locks you out from running, reloading or using aid items  
---
The pistol does as well
---
&gt; t's quite annoying, as only bashing or changing to other weapon and back solves it.  
---
shooting one round from the pistol cancels it, too
---
Lol who else uses the Imperial system aside from the USA anyways?
---
This would make public events like scorched earth a nightmare.   Everybody would be wanted.
---
I did this shortly after that update dropped. Put a Pioneer Scouts banner in front of one of my vending machines and carried all the things needed to complete the badges. Shit sold like hotcakes.
---
Pvpers complaining about bush wookies just don't know have to play battle Royale games period. Battle Royale is all about getting the jump on other players.
---
Depends on build, best "best" set is secret service be sides that it's a mix of metal leather and dense chest to min max blocking as much as possible while adding the right mods that you need for you build.
---
So the best set of armor is figure out your build first aka bloodied you want unveilding + on low health on everything , but a full health junkies stealth you want stealth suit etc...
---
Its mods are similar to sturdy ones so it is popular belief that it is sturdy.
---
You shold have told him you'll be calling his mom to ban him playing on xbox for one month.
---
Definitely plans, and you didn't just get the one-use mods?
---
Do you have all 3 tnt keys?
---
 The scout badges will definitely keep you busy for a while as well.
---
I actually don't mind workshop pvp mode. At first I was annoyed, but now I just put stashes everywhere. I only take workshops for the defense quests.
---
You'll need the presonal terminal for finding the Tourist/camera.
---
Can you sell Frog Habitats? ... or maybe just the materials to craft them?
---
Almost impossible for me with no text chat available.
---
I’ve saw this done but never known how to do it so thank you!! Very clean and simple
---
Bungalows make perfect tiny homes.
---
Less likely to have kids on PC though but I guess that will change more in the next decade or 2.
---
Sounds like you possibly used mods instead of plans. If you've learnt the plans you will be able to do it again. Assuming you have all the materials like the flux etc.
---
Same I heard about it but never seen it done.  That would make it even easier, I might just do that.  You get good treasury notes for that and lots to kill, plus chance at a few tickets.  I will try it!
---
I think any story content should always be free.
---
Kids with nothing to do with being out of school for so long. Without proper parenting they become absolute disgusting people online.
---
We would end up paying and then it probably wouldn't be as great as everyone expected and we would be disappointed anyways.
---
I would be fine with paying more money and just having more frequent patches that don't necessarily involve content but rather bug fixes and QOL stuff.  I would literally pay double or triple what I am paying for first per month if they could provide me with a game that doesn't have a laggy inventory/stash/vendor/trade UI.
---
I usually go for a 5×3 foundation two storie or a 5×4 one storie with a little workshop garage to the side. I want to make my place feel homely to anyone who passes. It could be a restaurant or a house design. Either way I want it to look lively.
---
I would absolutely hate to split up the community
---
PC. Had this bug for the first three months, constant disconnects every 10-30 minutes. Asked beth support about it and got no help. Changed my PW multiple times, reached out to my internet provider. Nothing helped. Left FO76, came back when wastelanders came out just for curiosity and experienced the disconnects were gone. I believed it was bad coding / servers in the beginning.
---
Sad to hear it is still around. Good luck to you, hope it just magically goe away as mine did. Don't expect any help from support, though...
---
I'm a bush wookie and will play that way for as long as I can but it always comes down to PvP in the end some I've won most I've lost but I've still participated, I've also had quite a bit of negative response from people don't like that I'm being a bush wookie my response is always the same "piss off random person I DONT !!! play this game for you and don't care how you feel about it.  Funny thing is everyone that has complained about it i have lasted longer in that match than they did
---
Interesting.  Wonder if bethesda is using low health as a flag that you might want unyielding and therefore the chance of getting it becomes far worse... Hmm.
---
Round em up!!!! good shit!
---
Just cripple their leg, and don't kill them. That way, they can't spawn new ones :)
---
And I am always at low hp and roll shitloads of vanguards.
---
This is why they need to bring back the survival mode and completely separate PvE and PvP. Those types can only do PvP in a game where people dont want to PvP.
---
Now this could all be solved by giving us more camp budget, that way we al happy.
---
Booze wasn't even close to his problem 
---
And why does being an alcoholic require a bullet? 
---
Fucking straitedgers
---
Shut up and take my money.  
---
And when we are here, having mutation request ...  
---
3rd leg would be great too. you know, just kick you in your sack whenever you try / fail to fast travel.
---
The change is much needed and about time. Far too many scab PvPers out there abusing the system because they can't kill others with their own merits.
---
I can't imagine there's a long list of group verse group PvPers   playing this game since the majority of players don't care about it at all.
---
 The way this game is set up makes for terrible PVP. It is completely gear based and you really don't need any skill at all to compete if you have good gear.
---
Exactly. I think at least 1/3 of the budget added on extra would be nice. Along with 1000 stash weight.
---
I help run public events (I have more than 1000 Treasury Notes), and I am also writing a Fallout 76 novel. I use my playtime to gather story content, make notes, and check on characters.
---
Like?
---
I’ve built in a train car and empty busses, they make adorable tiny homes and you save a ton of build space not having to make foundations or walls. Had to rug glitch everything inside but hey, it just works!
---
Your fault for listening to the lies and not playing it .. sure every game has bugs, somethings are frustrating but it has been fairly stable and fun to play for a long time .. I have been playing it pretty much daily since release .. we have seen improvements and some not so great changes but overall has been a lot of fun with friends.
---
I haven't checked in forever, but a hardened 308 did more damage than a .50. I remember this very well, because all I wanted was an "antmaterial rifle" like in FNV and was very disappointed. Is that fixed now?
---
Yeah I am with you .. that stash weight is such BS and a game ruiner ..
---
Who has that much time? I mean really.
---
the sentence was based on the feelings of u/Imacranberry
---
But I guess I hit the bull's eye. 
---
I'm sorry if you have had bad experiences with it, I didn't mean that.
---
That makes no sense at all
---
This would be a pretty funny little easter egg if they added it in secretly.
---
I have a full set of light leather armor that I wouldn't trade for the world. My light armor makes me sneak better which is what my main gameplay is.
---
I was actually kind of mad that Bethesda didn't add new light armors from the bullion vendor. The only light armors that were there were previously there and they are covered in weeds and looks stupid.
---
As a stealth rifleman I don't need anything but light armor because nothing ever sees me to hit me so I prefer light armor. I'll probably always prefer light armor.
---
My thinking was that because of the new seasons where atoms could be earned faster (might be wrong on this).  The DLC's are technically free and purchasing them is just a short cut.
---
Thanks dude! Managed to get about 4k steel accidentally yesterday! Yeah, I don't want to be a part of those horror stories haha. Thanks for the tip
---
I have a bed, all workbenches (even a PA station) a guitar and a stashbox/scrapbox in my backwoods bungalow (trailer).  On top I have a generator and 5 rocket turrets.   I can take it anywhere, all I need to do is plop down a water purifier and I am set.
---
Wait, what does royal jelly have to do with the tadpole quests?
---
Makes sense...
---
I wonder if I can play the accordion! 😁👍👍
---
I made a new character for waslanders. I just ran headfirst into high level areas. Gained levels way quicker than my main character. Also the stew from feed the people and sleeping.
---
Thanks for the replies. I didn't know I need the perk just to install the mod.
---
But the option to pay is optional, you can grind out atoms and it should be easier with the new seasons that they are implementing. I do agree some QOL stuff would be nice like giving PA a separate tab in your stash box.
---
Really I don't mind pvpers in workshops. But that's cuz I build to counter them. This one pvper was very deadset on killing me, but thanks to blueprints, I already had a solid defensive guard tower equipped with turrets. We ended up at an impasse. He was hiding from my turrets on the other side of my wall, and I just started chatting with him. The resources you get from workshops are meagre compared to raiding places known to have those materials. My policy is to only harness 1 or 2 resources, drop a premade guard tower, and go raid. I only come back for pve defense. Of course, pvpers sometimes use the events to screen their attacks, but that's why I put a stash next to my fast travel mat.
---
There are no mods for the ultracite p.a.
---
I meant it that way lol. I just come back from the ded :)
---
Communism is everywhere in fallout 76, even the overseer has a red star on her house
---
I want you to take that sadness and bury it deep inside yourself. 
---
I'm not trying to be mean to you.  It's just that they don't care.  They never have.  They've always left it up to us modders to make the fixes the community needs.  I mean ask yourself this... why is it taking them so long to put a perk loadout in the game.  Answer:  They don't care.
---
If I only had a dollar for everybody that complained about PVP in a PVP zone.
---
 By taking over a workshop you click a button to agree that you are now in a PVP zone.  I guess I just don't understand the logic of people not understanding that.
---
 Some people for some reason like to PVP in this game and that is the only place left they have to do it. If you want to build-up a workshop and not worry about pvp then you will have to get fallout 1st and use a private server.
---
Yeah i get it.  New content is nice but I guess I'm just hung up on wanting our existing content to work properly rather than adding more stuff that will probably be buggy anyways.  I want them to fix NPCs that don't want to talk to you or pause in the middle of conversation before adding ANY more NPCs or content involving them.  I would happily pay extra for expedited progress towards these kinds of fixes.  I could entertain myself almost indefinitely with what we already have if it just didn't annoy the crap out of me so much when shit don't work.
---
On double xp I saw people getting like 5-10 levels a challenge. It’s crazy
---
Hmm okay, you sure you have the flux you need then? Have to admit I haven't had this happen to me.
---

yeah there are some reason douche canoes here online......

I was about to feel bad . Then a read Xbox .
---
So really you're at a fault here . Pick a better community this year .
---
Beat me to it,Bravo!
---
Learn something new everyday
---
Honestly I just want the cryo turrets so that when I bring my base to SBQ, no one is forced to pull out the cryolater. Always looking out for my teammates even if they refuse my team up offers :)
---
Do not draw unnecessary conclusions.
---
Dont forget, that this is a game.
---
If i want to shot someone ingame, i do not want to do this in reallife. man, calm down.
---
I mean...chems are nice...but I channel my jonesing in to rage and my rage in to hitting things harder until they die.
---
[](/flutterhay)
---
My biggest problem with this guy isnt the pvp, but the pvp then dming to mock me. Repeatedly hunting me down when I respawn irked me a bit
---
There is no get gud. There is only get gud armor and weapons. You don’t even have to be good or know how to aim.
---
So that is why they spawn at the missile launcher? Interesting, like shooting fish in the barrel there....
---
Thanks for this.
---
Some people see it as a weakness to admit when they are wrong, given proof, and to change their mind.  I see it as requiring flexibility, mental strength, and a little bit of courage.  And so, I'm taking my own advice.  I was wrong.
---
CAMP budget is a set amount and it only seemed like it was increasing as Bethesda lowered the budget cost for some items and fixed bugs over time.  Good to know that I can build the same CAMP for my new character as my current one.  
---
Again, thanks for pointing this out.
---
The Internet.
---
You seem to misunderstand 
---
You're last post made no sense. Like litterally 
---
Obviously you don't want to shoot people in real life 
---
Still an ignorant original statement though
---
Dust Wings’s or Dust Wing Inn
---
Don't worry i only found out semi-recently myself
---
Ok, clearly still a lvl 96 newb....who sells bullion?  Maybe just haven’t found him since just did the vault quests 2 nights ago
---
slow day at the office xD
---
Yeah your best bet would be to block them and hop servers unfortunately. 
---
Outside of workshops make sure you have passive on.
---
I'm not a fan of PVP in workshops by that understand why it's still there.
---
 It's mainly Bethesdas fault for not understanding and knowing their player base.  They thought they could make a fallout title and expect their fan base to all of sudden just like PVP.  The fallout franchise is a single player PVE experience. I have no clue how they got it so wrong.
---
Pretty much
---
I thought the hardened receiver gave has best damage ?
---
And patch 20 this week possibly it’s going to be nerfed as well
---
Personally I'd pay for new story content, however not everyone will want to do that, and splitting the player base would be a bad idea, so I'd rather all story content remain free. 
---
I already support the game with fallout 1st anyway, and I'm hoping that enough others also do to pay for the new content moving forward.
---
Hi, I hope that selfmade nad ammo for it will help you.
---
I make 2x2 platform for my stuff and another 2x2 platform for vendors.
---
Could take a low level and give them molotovs and/or a missile launcher.
---
They'd shoot through the levels
---
Every year people ask for other countries flags and every year people come out to downvote them.
---
Just do what I do: bring your mobile camp to SBQ, plop down some turrets, serve free drinks at the punch bowl. Get lots of sales from appreciative customers in power armour :)
---
Don't worry about fixing turrets, you can just reset them by replanting your camp site. Just don't Bethesda or they might "Fix it" D:
---
Yep.
---
It all depends on ur play style.  But SS armor is by far the best armor in game
---
That's my favorite part!
---
I'll partially grant you that, but then in conversation with the head honcho there he explicitly says it's considered a shit detail by all the other raiders and he's essentially there as punishment.
---
They said straight up that Seasons will reduce the number of atoms up for grabs through pure gameplay on average. And not to mention the amount of backlash and probable player count drops that would occur if they started charging for DLC after continually re-emphasizing their promise for all DLC to be free. Switching likely wouldn’t be worth it and probably make even less money
---
No problem at all my good friend, knowledge is power! Have you seen the Flamingo Units post? Someone worked out how much budget each items takes up, usung Flamingos.
---
I don't use PA but you may also need the correct perk card equipped.
---
Go to the Wayward and head up stairs, you can buy up 300 gold for 6000 caps, the options scale down so you don't have to buy that much.
---
Agree on your points. It's just that realistically speaking, It has to be give and take, you cant keep supporting something when it doesnt make sense. Im glad Bethesda didnt give up on this game, but personally I think that having all future content be free is also a bit unfair, specially with the game having no mandatory subscription.  
---
My thought was that with paid DLC, they get the chance to continue supporting the game and putting out content for it. I would personally subscribe to 1st if my schedule freed up enough.
---
Yeah someone tried this shit on me the other day. I spotted it just as I was getting back to my camp. I logged out before they could do any damage.
---
This would make me so happy
---
So, if you have a gaming PC, and an Xbox, why would you want to play on Xbox instead?
---
Heavy combat armor will be the easiest just buy the plans and make it will want bos mod for it.  Forest/urban scout legendary drops could take you 100 levels to farm and you have to buy each mod from modus (no plan to learn) or you finish the wasterlander content and will need 6000 gold to buy the plans/mods and scrip to buy 100s of legendary modules and you can make your own secret service armor
---
I do not know how much money this game needs to make a month for it to be economically viable, but between the high price of the atom store, fallout 1st subscription, and the website exclusive bundles, i think Bethesda is making enough money off of a "free to play game" for it to cover the costs of the development team or what..? two guys and a gerbil at this point? 
---
I do not understand the belief that maybe if we just throw more money at them they will do good stuff quickly. Good stuff takes time, and effort. So far fo76 has been out for over a year, there are still bugs from beta, the biggest expansion so far was delayed over six months, and there has yet to be a patch yet that did not unleash a new set of bugs, or worse reunleashed bugs that took six months to fix in the first place. I like the game, i think it has amazing potential but i fail to see why people constantly offer to throw money at Bethesda for what they should be doing in the first place. That is making a enjoyable game, that we can play together, without pay walls locking off content based on the size of your wallet.
---
don't downvote people for an honest mistake!!!!
---
As an original "hater" of 76 but a big fallout fan I feel the game is now fun for a traditional fallout fan.  It's essentially fallout 4 with a few real people in the world.  The community is very helpful 99% of the time.  It's honestly a pretty enjoyable experience with a few classic bethesda bugs to make you feel at home.
---
All my xbox characters predate my pc. I don't want to play xbox, but I don't want to lose them.

You have to buy on steam as well

I see it went the other way now. Americans went to sleep and he got upvoted? Don't think other countries would downvote him for asking for other countries' flags.

I see. Have you tried to install the Bethesda launcher and use your Microsoft info to see if it works? Just for ha-ha’s?

Not the case, I’ve had my accounts linked since about April 3rd.
---
In my experience, they stand there and take it.
---
SMF? He called you a sexy motherfucker?
---
I mean they're both registered to the same email
---
Same with any other well made build. Once you have one of those builds it’s basically easy mode.
---
I'm happy to support the game if I'm actively playing and enjoying it, which I am currently. I just treat it like any other sub for a MMO. 
---
At the price it's at I still get more than my money's worth every month. If I stop playing it for a bit I'll cancel, simple as that. 
---
More content would be sweet though, 100% agreed on that.
---
Try it for shits n giggles
---
You all ever been just wandering around and hear the sound of a mine alarm/ detonation chime out of no where? A mini heart attack for no reason.
---
Scorchbeasts have damaged my camp before.
---
Do they have Krusty Partially Gelatinated Non-Dairy Gum-Based Beverages?
---
Also you're closer to her so you do more damage. Gotta get close and enable damage numbers to see what damage you're doing. You always see explosive weapon users plinking rounds off her from a mile away, probably doing the absolute minimum damage and just wasting ammo. Shotgunners especially
---
The rare one is white. It’s a very rare chance from the mission.
---
Crafting one of the food recipes for the chef badge iirc.
---
Only about 1% of the player base actually has legacies, so I don't see how it bothers the other 99%. The only place where they are a problem is in PvP, but that system is already fucked anyways
---
Back in the day it was whitesprings where around 14 spawned. Recently I had 5 at awol armaments
---
If you count doing the hoard trick for 3 hours, around 17
---
I don't get why it doesn't have more mods..
---
but it is too strict and in some cases it doesn't even make sense. Someone replied to my lfg post on destiny  and private msged me "something something power level, but im a girl"
---
so I replied with "so what if you are a girl, join". Nothing else.
---
got 2 weeks com banned with the description that i was being misogynistic. ok microsoft
---
Let’s just ignore that those perks don’t work half the time, shall we?
---
The responder uniform is the very rare one, has a matching white helmet.
---
The holloween costume is also rare, but not nearly as much as the responders. Only rare since its from a limited time event
---
The fire breathers uniform is not rare at all and is given from a quest
---
Would that be sturdy trapper, metal, robot, or combat that it's similar too?
---
I never said all fans.
---
Lame request, grind harder!
---
For the millionth time, you accept the risk of PvP if you claim or take a workshop. It’s not yours to keep.  
---
Why people camp out and burn up mats is beyond me.  
---
I’ll take one for fusion cores but I’m in and out because if you hang around too long you know someone will try to gank.
---
Ohmygodyoujokethief
---
As people have said she'll only do the gas attack if her target is not on the ground. You'll be able to tell this pretty easily if she is constantly doing that attack right above someone on a tent. I've tested this a few times.
---
What I eat to know is what was meant by "moving" the tent? Like, moving to the Scorched Earth event or moving it away? And how does that simple little thing get 300 nasty messages?!
---
Offer Black titanium for Excavator quest too
---
No class data that I've seen yet.
---
But my suspicion is that wood will be light
---
Marine sturdy
---
And SS/scout heavy
---
Nah, age does NOT equal maturity.
---
I don't see how this is a problem for the 99.9% of the player base that doesn't own any legacies. They aren't nearly as expensive as you are portraying them to be, and if you cant bother to work hard to get them then don't. Its not like the game is unplayable without a legacy. If you dont like them then don't get one. No need to come here and bitch about it just because you can't afford one.
---
I've crafted 120 SS torsos so far, and have gotten **2** unyielding. One 1star, one 3 star.
---
I did get 13 hunters, and 9 life saving.
---
I've also only gotten 3 Bolstering, with one of those being 3 stars.
---
Last time someone started blowing up my messages I laughed at him and said "what are you 10?"
---
He responded "No, I'm 12"
---
Someone will be interested.
---
I'm just not one.
---
I want the history of the molemen.
---
Yep my friends camp is in a very disputed peice of land and people will fuck with us until they realize we arnt gonna leave to try and push us out of the server or relize the reason I left his camp was to lore hordes into their camp to destroy it
---
How many times do I need to tell people this. You don't need a legacy to be good at the game. If you can't be bothered to work hard to get one then don't. I'm sick of the whole "I can't afford it so I want it for free" mentality.
---
Except there are plenty of “lower level” players that have top tier weapons and armor. 
---
I’m lvl 338 and I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been killed by someone half my level.  I had back and forth with a level 65 guy two months ago and he was stealth boy and Tesla’d and in full god mode w/burning effect and you aren’t killing that person.
---
What level are you? I'm level 60 and want to launch one but don't have a mic.
---
Thanks!
---
This game is so past saving if that’s the majority opinion now.
---
Well, my problem is the d bag that gets on his mic or messages me yelling and screaming or sending inflammatory or offensive comments because I took their shop.  Again, a workshop is not your private camp.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject

---
I would be fine with that. Or make a new vendor who does it.
---
well do this easy and gently..... no......why?.... i a pc player create a new char. drop 800lbs of duped and moded items onto it. then transfer it to ps4... i create another new char drop 800 lbs onto it and transfer it to xbox. and or vice versa. this also works for caps. they keep the servers seperate to reduce spreading of duped items and people power levling and selling account cross system
---
This would be a fun solo mode. Take spawn times, and crate targetting out of it.
---
Come on dude, don't be a simp for Bethesda.
---
They already have 4 monetisation schemes for this game (3 current and one coming very soon). We don't need to add a 5th one. 
---
Remember that Bethesda is a multi-billion dollar company. They're not strapped for cash. If this game can't sustain itself with 4 ways to monetise it, it doesn't deserve to survive.
---
Bruh no my guy im just wondering if the rumors are true or fo76 is being a broken game again or my "cow dung" internets being stupid
---
Remind me of that one one more time? I can check
---
See you say that but I see legacy weapons on a weekly basis without fail.

Huh, so that is what happened. I seen this the other day and was wondering what happened

---
Log in , do rep missions, do dailies, scrip legendary items , hit scrip limit , craft or save mats , do next character or log off. Or do some of that, explore , launch a nuke on a big ass bat , kill everything on the server over and over until something worthy of being used or sold drops. Seek out unknown plans. Just don't trust owls, they are misleading .
---
Wow, I have my tent there for ease, had no idea!
---
I would have been so mad if I was on my usually unarmed build as she didn't land, at all. But thankfully I was on my new heavy guns build!
---
I can see why people are fine with focusing on heavy and light, but why would anyone want to go after sturdy? Sure, you could probably do fine with both sneaking and have okay damage resist, but neither would be at a high extreme.
---
Also, why does normal armor get this, and PA gets no additional damage resist from the perks at all? I know there’s the innate bonuses, but the game doesn’t even tell you about those.
---
When this happens if you wait around long enough for it to turn into a meat/metal pile you will be able to loot it.  Not exactly ideal I know but it's what we got.
---
This actually sounds really cool. I’d get the insect parts too for the spray.
---
There are a lot of issues with this game. Stealth is a fair way down that list, if it's on the list at all.
---
No, anything like this would fragment the player base, which is why Bethesda isn’t doing it.
---
Isn't that McDonald's? Royal Käse. Confused the hell out of me when I wanted a QP

When in tall grass or bushes I can usually find it once the flies show up or the glow depending upon which firearm I used to kill it.

theres a really easy way to avoid that and its by messaging couriers or middlemen
---
I/O Error
---
Didn't happen with 2 of them. I waited around for like 5 mins searching the area just in case it relocated elsewhere.
---
Whats that
---
I’m so sorry about that! Where did you even find this person to trade with? I’ve only had good luck trading so far, and if I feel someone is not legit, they go first or no deal, even if it’s a better deal for me. Did you use a trusted courier from different Reddits to broker the deal?
---
These were all on non-grass areas. One in open dirt, one I saw hit the streets of watoga and one was inside on a catwalk ramp.
---
No just i just found the guy from xbox looking for a post
---
You and someone else give the courier your trade items and then they switch them for you
---
Sounds like you were trading threw the lfg page and not using a trading group like the trade sub or a face book group. It really sucks but it could have been avoided
---
It doesn't matter who you choose.
---
Oh ok thx man
---
I've had a few of those bears show up and just tear everything up.
---
The raider punk is my favorite. His dialogue updates with each completed mission. And it just gets weirder and funnier.
---
Oh, thanks
---
That's unfortunate.  The only other tip I can offer is that the camera will help you locate bodies if it's a grassy or swampy area but you said it wasn't so yeah.  It's broke.  Honestly when this happens I just tell myself what I was gonna get was gonna be scrip anyways and don't even bother anymore.  Best of luck

“There's an old saying in Tennessee — I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee — that says, fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again.” ― George W. Bush

that's because Tesla and Legacies are broken in pvp.

I know its my fault just cant believe there are suck sick people out there

Every time I see an intact motorcycle or hand car I get excited for a moment. I always try to interact because my brain insists that one of these days that's going to work.
---
well i have 4 builds. 1 is PA build. doesn't help you heavy gun build....
---
a stealth build = Chinese stealth suit. (sniper build) need to be fixed so i can wear gilly suit.
---
adventure set = vanguard set secret service jetpack bolstered.
---
the one-hit-wonder. = secret service unyielding 3 star set. with a bloodied weapon either my lever action rifle. or my legacy survival server reward deathclaw gauntlet. (unstoppable monster)
---
with the right perks and syrims. it hits at like 2k. usally exploding everything in its wake. if not they hit me and boom im dead. casue i have 40 hp.... it does more with food and bobbleheads and magazines active.
---
Fool me once...
---
Ya i have learned though
---
To be honest iam a legacy collector.
---
I Have like 35+ legacy
---
Including rare stuff in ps4.
---
The point is i wouldnt trade my legacies for any of the current drop in the game and most of the hardcore players do the same.
---
The only reason to be against legacy drop back its earning money with this.
---
Since a lot of people only sell it for real money in black market or trade for bundle of good handmades/fixers to sell it later for real money in black market.
---
Or play in pc that the items gine crazy a while ago.
---
Yeah, you can't get access to Regs (who sells the plans), until you finish the raid.
---
The real question is, are you going to learn from this experience? Cause you didn't the first time around.
---
Follow the advice people are giving you. Don't trade unless you have a trusted courier/middleman.
---
Do they always eventually turn into a meat/scrap pile or is it when a certain number are dead on the ground?
---
I agree with this. I’d like that option a lot. I would also really like universal skin packages and the option to make armor pieces appear invisible. Say you just like the look of the heavy combat chest with no arms you could actually do that with out losing any resistances. Kind of like the UCO mod from FO4
---
Isn't that a Mr.Gutsy line?
---
It doesn't matter who you do the raid with really you can max rep with both after anyway. You should play both sets of missions up until you get to decide who to run the raid with though to maximise the rewards. You get the chinese stealth armour from one of the foundation quests for example. You can also get a unique plasma if you run the raid with the raiders and are nice to ra-ra during her mission.
---
You need to spend the gold bullion to buy the plans for the secret service armor, which you can only do after you've raided the vault, your rep with either faction is moot as you buy it from the secret service guy regs in the vault.
---
Yeah never trade threw the lfg page, 95% of them are scammers. If you go in to my post history you will see the trading sub. We are not allowed to name it here.
---
They have a karma system so you can see who's trustworthy, and also have dedicated couriers who have been vetted by the mods if you are still not comfortable. I've been on there since I started, have done around 300 trades and never once been scammed
---
Since i really want to farm my stuff instead of feeding the black market the legacy drops should for be enabled again in the servers.
---
Dont ever trade without a trusted courier!?!  ESPECIALLY valuable items...
---
How does the camera help in grassy areas?
---
I will 
---
If i find the urge to play again i will use FB
---
Or a reddit
---
I meant subreddit
---
85% of the player base grieved at launch.
---
Griefing is top tier rp.
---
Private server is worth it.
---
Hmm I want to say it's time because sometimes I go to an area and kill something and don't loot it but comeback sometime later and it is a meat pile.  But there were a few others around, not many though.  That's actually a good question that would have to be tested but I think it's time.
---
Nobody cares about your son story
---
if you hover over a dead body of something itll pop up in the corner as being part of the picture
---
Good luck. If that's your approach, you're going to need it.
---
It does count as semi auto. Those 2 guys are wrong.
---
I am very unlucky😂😂
---
And stupid
---
I’m the same build and wear heavy and never get seen. No shadow mod either. I do have two harder to detect pieces as well as run sneak three and evasive maxes, would light armor allow you to free up the sneak card slot or are you still running sneak/evasive?
---
I had this happen at an line in the sand last week and was so confused,  it was hilarious though, cos it was raining scorched all in the middle.
---
people mod the game. those mod typically stay on their side of there screen. i really dont want to be just trying to bu a few piece of steel and see 20 photos of you having sex with a dead body... or images people transfer into that folder and its swasticas, rebel battle flags, dead kid, people bonking or your damn cats............. now we also figure in 20 hd images being force loaded in every time you run by a house. 20+ times a day would really bog down the game.
---
hey desemos! We have around 5 minutes footage of you hacking with very legit proof. You were flying, going under map, aimbot, god mode and 1 shotting ppl. At least 15 players have footage of you hacking in NW. Hope you get banned soon.
---
The flamer plasma is fun but it eats ammo really fast. My pal uses an instigating lever the majority of the time and switches to the plasma for the big fights.
---
I can access these without fallout first. Not sure it’s a first exclusive?
---
Shoot me a PM, Gt: Mr Newking
---
I always wondered. I thought it was based on the number of dead but I'm not sure. I wish they would make them all meat piles immediately upon death since the flies help with finding.
---
Prior experience, when I've "kite" them to other players and we kill it and it disappears, it re-spawns back at its original spawn location.
---
Good
---
Where is this laughing emote . That's been requested many times but no word on release. Second. Workshops are there for pvp, it is the intention of the devs. When you claim it, a message warns you of this. I personally wouldn't attack a player under level 60 , as they haven't had the chance to finish their builds. But I also have friends that re roll new characters just to pvp at low levels. I've had my ass ripped apart by low levels using legacy weapons. Pvp is a mess in this game. But, you had warning.
---
And now I’ve added those and new Vegas to my playlist! Hooray!
---
15 DR from nerd rage is pathetic
---
If these vehicles haven’t been driven in a while the gas is bad.  Why I can build a fusion reactor but can’t fix a bicycle that’s missing a seat is a different issue.
---
Anyone else chuckle at the “twenty-thirth”?
---
He did the laughing and mocking in the dms.
---
Only one thing in the world could've dragged me away from the soft glow of electric sex gleaming in the window.

I have the same thing! I don't mind, one less back and forth trip!

Although it's labeled as a mod, it's not. It's a tool that makes editing your \*.ini settings mega double easy:  
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/546](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/546)   
---
There's a setting for changing your Pip-Boy Light colors. I love it.
---
Sounds good.  But does the medium armor have any use?
---
Yeah that does thanks! Kind of a weird mechanic. Youd think if 1 crop makes 4 per hour, 2 crops would make 8. I dont know why they decided to go that route
---
I'll have to bear that in mind if it ever happens again. I mean we shouldn't have to but this game is what it is.
---
Why is it such a big deal? You press a button and spend some resources to fix your camp.
---
Go play Rust and you’ll soon find that “griefing” in FO76 is pretty fucking tame.
---
With cheats like server hopping and fast travel, why get so upset?
---
Now, losing 3 days of work to a trip with AK47’s and some C4... that is something to cry about.
---
God damn people, man up. You’re in the apocalypse, not happy go lucky land where everyone gets along.
---
The Bug Light. Post pics!
---
Holy man there's so much conflicting advice in this thread.
---
Your stat spread isn't bad, but you need you decide between two things:
---
\#1 Bloodied Build - you walk around with 80% Rads, so you're at 20% health, this will mean you are going to need Nerd Rage(I3), Serendipity(L3), Radicool(E1), you'll roll around with a bloodied weapon, and 5 pieces of unyielding or bolstering Armor (giving you about 20-30 in each stat at all times) -- with all the perks even in 20% health, you'll be QUITE tanky, but you can fall to some bad RNG sometimes.  Bloodied builds Are MORE powerful for Melees due to the impact of STR from unyielding.
---
This youtuber I discovered a few weeks ago when I started playing again(took a year off), Angry Turtle basically will give you a perfect build and guide:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTac4ojP9iA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTac4ojP9iA)  Highly recommended.
---
\#2 Full Health Build -- this will be more traditional, where you get addicted to 5 Chems and use Junkies weapons -- this lets you do about 30% of the Damage that a bloodied melee build will but with no risk to your health.
---
Personally, I tried Junkies first, didn't like it, went to bloodied, but with a Vampire weapon for Tanky situations (and I jump in power armor with an Emergency protocol)
---
Either way you can fix your build in 3-5 moves, this is what I'm using right now at 90
---
Melees need a minimum of STR15 P1 End1(recommend4) 4Cha, I5, A(6 -- you NEED white knight, you take too many hits) , Luck 8(at least, I prefer 11)

---
absolutely. your camp is safe.
---
It's a semi light armor with some benefits of heavy armor. 
---
If you're not a full sneak but would like some aspects of sneak that's probably the armor you would want.
---
 I am not 100% sure though that's just my opinion.
---
Heavy armors are obviously for the tanky type builds.
---
Yeah it seems fun. But the vats accuracy seems to really suck on it with the flamer and pulse combo
---
This may as well be a new everything request. This game is so stagnant when it comes to regular content.
---
Tent pole DLC like Wastelanders is great but it's these dead periods for months inbetween that really suck.
---
Name it Tough love
---
Grants +4 Endurance but you receive minor damage from sprinting (from all them slaps)
---
They're high levels picking on low levels because they know if they picked on someone their own size/level, the other person would wipe the floor with them.
---
Charisma should be considered to be minimum 4 for a melee character, -- Lone wanderer 4 solo, you have to go charging in. 
---
For teams swap to Inspirational (3/3) and Strange in Teams, since all players basically play with mutations now (especially fantastic for melee chars)
---
Along with any non grief pvp in adventure mode
---
I, among other 1sters have been arguing this with other posts that the sales were happening.  We would always be shouted out of the room as blatant Bethesda fanboys.  
---
Yes it should be labeled better.
---
Oh shit, is it? Spent...probably the first year, obtaining a set of Vanguards Hvy combat. Whoops
---
Man, I still don’t have the s’mores recipe. How many times do I have to do the campfire tales?! No bonus badges from completing it either.
---
Not to mention Bloodied weapons.  What weapon type has the same synergy with Vanguard?
---
If you're playing Melee, you probably won't need it to be honest, bloodied melee standard build in unyielding Armor has about 800 Base damage on a one hander.
---
So long as you don't relocate your camp, it'll still be in the same spot on a world where that spot is free.
---
Even if those perks don't work ever, dying is such a non-issue in the game that it's not a risk-reward thing to go for a Bloodied build. You kill most things before they have a chance to hit you back anyway, and if you do die, you respawn nearby, grab the little bits of junk you had and keep going.
---
Agreed. 100% safe
---
If your first request was denied it’s unlikely it would be honored again.
---
Well technically BOS heavy combat is a hair better, so if you have that then stick with it.
---
Oh, hell yeah! I thought that might be the case provided I don't move it or anything before changing worlds
---
The market only makes up about 20-30% of the actual player base. I'd say about 80% of the normal player base doesn't even know what a legacy is, let alone has one. Sure you may see a few per week, but if you think about the fact that you see maybe about 100-200 different players per day due to server hops and disconnects its not surprising at all. I've only ever seen 3 people that weren't from reddit with legacies on public servers
---
I cramped my workbenches into the seedy shed. And my vendors go in the log cabin. Melons and 2 water purifiers outside. That's my whole camp. I cant stand having to walk around searching a giant structure for 5 minutes only to find peoples vendors in the dirt somewhere outside.
---
Yes i tried, i am 100% sure i had the plans learned, after all i remember building them and i have my own P.A as proof, i had a support request but im sure they will do nothing,there is no item return policy anyway. Its a pity because i had hundreds of SBQ fights to get them and after the outage i cant find them.
---
Same!
---
Then someone like you who ain’t a Bloodied build comes along, kills whatever stabbed me in the back and steals it all. I’ll be carrying anywhere from .1-200lbs of junk, more if I just did/am about to do a trade. If I get one tapped I permanently have that risk.
---
You cant do 4v4 anymore after that patch. Only 1v1
---
What a life the dude must have to send that many messages 😂
---
I think the fast travel failing maybe is already enough of a kick in the sack lol 😂
---
Never, ever, ever use LFG to find a trade - and if you still want to, get a reliable courier.
---
I have several legacies as well and I am in the same boat as you. I only ever trade my legacies for other legacies, and then I keep them when I am happy with them. However due to the number of people that have legacies and don't care about trading them away I usually trade for a few per month to add to my collection
---
If you haven't already, please pleeeeease report to XB1. They do get comm ban and if you're lucky, they will make another account or be dumb enough to message you again when the ban is lifted and you'll get to report them again which leads to a perma ban of the account!
---
Speaking from experience, been derided two times like this in my time playing and both resulted in the douche canoe getting their accounts banned.
---
F this guy, your tent your rules!
---
I love it personally; melee I'm usually one shotting things but with my shotgun I was able to kill a scorched beast in two hits. I believe you can't one shot due to the rubber banding health glitch from too much damage
---
Aye obviously nobody wants to see anything like that. Obviously I would expect that if they ever considered doing this (they won't) then they'd try to ensure that those things would not be possible. Also they could implement a max amount of photos, say three or four.
---
I'm not asking "hey Bethesda can we have photos that we can exploit so we can put child abuse/swastikas at our camps?"
---
I'm asking for our personal photos that are taken in game, not our personal photos outside of the game.
---
Yeah that sucks if that's the case, I'm assuming you've remembered to equip power patcher as well?
---
Just listing everything I can think of. By the sounds of things you know what you're doing, but hey it always pays to double check everything in my experience.
---
I mean they pretty much don't now.
---
The thing is, you can't really have weapons in the same way as Blloodied that increase the higher health you are - there would be basically no downside, whereas Bloodied is meant to have the downside of being more of a glass cannon.
---
"High Health" as its own build, opposite to Bloodied, exists with its own strength and weakness that it's harder to die but you deal less damage. There should be other builds similar to Bloodied where there is definite weaknesses and strengths, like Junkie's - you get damage but have to suffer addictions. "High Health" is only really a build because it's just a catch-all term for people who don't want to play Bloodied builds, and Bloodied builds are so pervasive in the meta.
---
And once everyone has everything then what? You probably can't wait for the next dupe too huh?
---
How much do y’all usually sell chems for? Mine usually range 10-20c depending on the item.
---
Thought so thanks
---
True that
---
Just be glad you didn't play in the early days...
---
Except Rust players are both unaffected and rather amused at these people’s efforts.
---
No it really is funny that these people think they are “griefing”.
---
PA will be able to bring you back to life with legendary perks cards so there is that.
---
Fallout 76 severely needs a trade item option not trade for caps trading menu And where both parties agree to the trade before it’s made.
---
Yes. I loved Mothership Zeta.
---
lol why?
---
ItS fUcKiNg SpACe AlIeNs!!
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
What level was your character?
---
Fucking 400 caps lol
---
I pieced together a really good set of Unyielding Scout Armor strictly because of the legendary perks...don’t have to worry about weight class with scout armor...but it was a nightmare making all the trades happen.
---
I had this over this past weekend. Can't remember, if I just changed servers or hard reset my Xbox, but it eventually reverted back to normal. I did receive the caps.
---
It's 20 hours.
---
And in the old days, each vendor only had 200 caps - you had to travel around the map to find each of the faction vendors to sell to (and it was still a 1400 cap limit).
---
It's 20 hours from the first time you sell something before it resets.  Not like that 4 hour difference makes it much better but that's what it is.
---
First off these perks you mentioned rarely work for me (maybe 50 percent of the time). And the small amount of dr you get from nerd rage is garbage.  So what your saying is you want perks that make high health biulds do the same damage as bloodied, then why would anyone even bother doing a bloodied biuld. What your suggesting would ruin like 60 70 percent of people's biulds and make most legendary affects completely useless. It sounds to me like someone lost there pacifier and is getting a lil cranky
---
You'll see that at some point trades get almost impossible to do since people wont accept even 1:1 legacies trade.
---
And they say thinks like :
---
"My ghoul slayer explo laser its much more rare than your AAE gatling plasma , add some more items and we have a deal"
---
Thats bullshit. And thats why trades died for me a while ago. Now a days it look worse than a couple weeks ago.
---
Lol thats what I've been naming my sniper rifle since F4
---
It's more toxic to take a workshop, go afk and still feel entitled to the workshop, and complain about pvp in a pvp zone then it is for someone to kill an afk player who knowingly initiated pvp by taking the workshop. 
---
I am sure you do not agree with me. But please think about it.
---
There doesn't need to be a downside.  What's the downside to a Two Shot or Anti-Armour weapon?
---
Maybe there isn't a "vanguard build" and that's ok.  But try as they might, "junkie" builds and others just have never reached the same level as Bloodied builds.  Games like this usually have a 'flavour of the month' build, but Bloodied has dominated for almost the whole game and it's getting tiresome.
---
Yeah I feel like I noticed that after wastelanders
---
I really wish there was a solution to this. The "hitboxes" of camps is way too big. If your camp is built you should be able to select the "border" of your camp that fits into the size of the building. So you have a greater chance of logging in successfully and keeping your building even if its close to others.
---
Pvp on an mmo style is dumb af go play gta or rdr for that shit...... They have a battle royal that is actually decent.... its much better then open world pvp..
---
oh god
---
should be 12 hours. Dunno why they chose 20 hours over 24.
---
See even this is off. I'm lucky if I see 100 unique players a week. I don't server hop unless forced to.
---
As I said without fail, at least 1 per week, almost all during large public events.
---
Given all the duping since launch, I don't think those legacies are as rare as you make out.
---
I play on PC though so not sure if that scews the numbers any.
---
That's the point, people without Max Builds shouldn't be doing End game events lol the point is to grind until you get a max build then be ready to take on End game events. We are talking about people who are already grinded for the Max builds and weapons. 
---
We want event for people who are lvl 100+ and even lvl 200+ with enemies that are lvl 95-150, if you played games like Monster Hunter you would see what I mean.
---
Each vendor had its own small cap pool.  If you wanted the full 1400 for the day you had to jump to each vendor and sell until you cleared them out....then hop to the next one....
---
Sounds fun right.
---
how did this game survive.
---
Just started the sheepsquatch quest hunting for my first Fixer, scrapping every combat rifle I come across in the meantime trying to get the mods I need for my sniper.
---
no.
---
It is likely that aliens other than the Flatwoods monster were cut.  If you refer to the bestiary in the official guide book they are in there.
---
I was not afk. I was planning to, and if I was afk I would have no problem with people killing me. The guy was standing there next to me as I claimed it and built it ground up, gave me a thumbs up when I was done, then proceeded to destroy it completely and killed me. Then every time I respawned he would kill me. Then proceeded to dm and mock me.
---
Without wastelanders I dont think it would have. I stopped playing about 6 months after it came out and only came back for wastelanders.
---
It’s been happening to me, with all kinds of bodies not just legendaries. I’m on Xbox and it feels like it’s a lag issue with servers.
---
Thanks! Duchass is what I thought her name actually was and then Google informed me of the polite spelling
---
The actual cooldown is 20 hours, starting on your first sale. Same for the scrip and gold machines.
---
So first thing you should do when starting a play session is initialize the cooldowns by visiting the vendor and the machines.
---
For exemple, at 6 pm you sale something (scrap some legendary or convert some treasury note). Then until the day after 2 pm you are running against the same limite of 1400 caps, 150 scrips, 20 notes.
---
At 2 PM, the limits reset.
---
I’m lvl150 now, solo player. I have the Chinese armor, good weaponry, and marsupial and chameleon mutations. 
---
I think I’m ready to launch my first nuke. 
---
Is there a good walkthrough I should follow?
---
The various faction vendors all had super low limits, and didn’t share a cap pool. So not only could you just sell a few hundred caps to a vendor, you also had to travel around the map to specific spots to sell to all the vendors possible. It was super annoying and tedious!
---
Yeah I had been collecting all of them too and I know all the mods for them, just need a bloodied one to drop now lol.
---
And then cry how you reached endgame armor after a week, and have nothing left to do.
---
Damn. I’d love to see something like this on pc.
---
I think the word completely is a little exaggerated, no?
---
Keep in mind, that’s only for the 1400c to NPC vendors. Start using your vending machines at your camp to make an unlimited amount of caps per day depending on what you sell and who is buying.
---
Raider lyfe!!
---
If you got extra atom points to spend, I think its a fun unique thing just from the random lines it spews out as you travel around. I bought it and you just need to repaint your helmet to get the audio clips and theres also a no audio paint that let's you keep the helmet paint if you just want that.
---
It could be possible. I personally think a Pitt DLC could be more possible though, as west viriginia is extremely close and the Settlers come from the Pitt.
---
Oh hell. You can do it that way? I jumped servers for days looking for one.
---
I gave up on that... Because Everytime I go to Modus to buy mods he has none. Even if I server hop.
---
Try the sleeping room in operations.
---
I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that the perceived downsides of Bloodied builds aren't massive downsides at all because it's easy to stay alive and dying isn't an issue in the game.
---
There needs to be some kind of balance to bring other builds in line with Bloodied. Rework dying so it's more of a risk to be low health. Buff the damage of other legendary weapons. At the moment, most legendary effects are completely useless, and I think some of them could get the same treatment as Bloodied where there are synergies in the game to maximise them.
---
Ok, where in the vault is operations?
---
I’ll try clearing the cache then at the press any button screen waiting a bit since I only get it once I got any button. And if those don’t work I’ll delete and reinstall/redownload.
---
I think I got mine from the chef robot in Whitesprings.
---
Yeah sucks if you aren't able to play at roughly the same time every day.  Without a cap limit though I think I could probably get myself from zero to max caps in a few hours no problem.  Still can with trades and vending but I think they were trying to avoid everyone being rich with max caps within 2 days of the game launching.
---
Some people don't run outfits on their characters. They like a mix of armour types for a specific aesthetic
---
Most of the vehicles have batteries or are powered by an on-board reactor, not internal combustion.  If we can find old power armor that works, we should be able to find a working Chryslus Corvega Atomic V8.
---
But the eternal engine marches on, ladders and vehicles be damned.
---
I have been playing on PS4 since the launch and never lost a whole armor set.  We once had all out PA armor have all the pieces come off in storage so we were way overweight, and I have had the frame flake out, but never lost the pieces.  If you got out of it and didn’t retrieve it as I do as a habit, maybe if your game crashed somehow it might lost it, but it rolls back to last save and again I have crashed hundreds of times and not lost armor.  I have grabbed a legendary off a dead mob crashed and not got it, and sometimes have, but that is like a fraction of a second.  
---
The ticket is the best bet, as I can’t say how you lose it?
---
Or a bonus for killing sleeping enemies 😉
---
Major Gutsy with 5,56 arm
---
Trust me I have done it several times and thought it didn’t work so I make another one and then find them both.
---
I believe The Fixer can only drop from the legendary vendor
---
I drop 2 from fasnacht event completion. Never seen a drop from an enemy though.
---
Scammers and Xbox. Name a more iconic duo. (Pro tip:  use the market sub instead)
---
But it’s less often than the life saving legendary effect, since the max is 45%.
---
Sometimes a role play as a lost Appalachian BoS soldier saying I came across special power armor I think it’s cool most people think it’s cool
---
Multiple times I've stayed and there isn't anyone in my spot, like wtf?
---
How can something that makes the event quicker and easier be bullshit?
---
Lmao
---
I found stealth boys have a fixed stealth to them in pve. Doesn't matter what you're wearing, when your on a stealth boy, it's a fixed level of stealth that sucks basically. It can ruin a good stealth set. If your wearing like all chameleon with the right legendary/user mods and pop a stealthboy, you go backwards in detection.
---
Yes. The tent from 1st works the same.
---
Most trap camps need the owner present to reset the traps or repair walls and flamethrowers. I would imagine the only ones where the owner doesn’t need to be there are ones with false floors and punji board pits. Or rides that phase you trough a wall with a punji board trap on the other side. But the clever ones need to be reset after they’re used.

Everything is better than PA
---
There is a lengthy story tied to the alien blaster, I never did the whole quest, but I watched Oxhorn telling of the story.
---
It complex enough and not one of those handholding quests.  You need to pull it together yourself.

What is ss armor considered? Sturdy? Its a pia to get the ss peices you want but atleast it all the same? : /
---
I had an AFK at my CAMP, surrounded them with Vault Boy statues staring at them
---
TRAP!
---
its really straight forward. Just get the codes online but the path through is pretty obvious other then the 'sameness' of most the rooms. Stealth helps and watch for ceiling turrets.
---
I regret buying it. Grind out nw and you get much cooler skins that don't talk all the time
---
Lucky you. They don’t with me. And they all seem to home in on me once I ahoot one.
---
They drop from the Purveyor and any events that use her full loot pool. Faschnact used this loot pool, but I'm not sure that regular public events do. You are most likely only getting it from the Purveyor right now. I would chalk those first 2 up as beginners luck.
---
This is def true.same with me.random fixer on that event.idk if all public events do this some threads have been made on ally quest being able to drop fixer or learned weapons as well
---
I'd play it, of course, but I'd rather see Bethesda stop indulging nostalgia. I really enjoyed the Scorched, Responders and all the other new stuff in 76. I'm not enthused by more Zetans, more BOS, more old stuff.
---
I'm pretty sure it's the main operations room in the gold vault area, I'll check later when I get home.
---
Unless anyone else knows of the top of their head.
---
Wait, does that work? Does having a 1-star version increase the chances of rolling a 3-star of the same item? How exactly does this work?
---
or are you just saying to compare the two?
---
Ok, np thanks!
---
Ive been playing since beta and i agree. This has never happened. So im kinda bewildered. But bethesda said they cant do anything about it
---
Honestly, make it something that’s difficult but not too difficult. Maybe a daily quest or require a plan to do this ? 1 piece of flux from light to medium, 2 for medium to heavy (along with screws leather etc)
---
It would be best if it was a side quest “Outfit the Troops” or something - the enclave or brotherhood has been gathering resources to fight the effort and wants to assist the freedom fighters (players). Once you complete it, there is a daily. And the grind would allow you to do 1 piece per week?
---
This is fantastic! Would you mind if we shared this on next week's FanartFriday from the BethesdaGameStudios social media accounts? We will absolutely credit you and source back to this post.

How did we go from Microsoft to liberty prime to Burger King to foot lettuce

Unable to watch video but is it the power connector rug stacking glitch?
---
i mean, it isn't just about discounts. people are aware that they have been shadow discounting small items. there are multiple other things that they haven't come through on that were advertised when F1st launched.
---
I'm fine with it, as I can mostly take a break from this and play other games, then come back to this later.  I guess it's great to have a ton of content and all, but also nice to at least periodically say "Yeah, my characters are in a good place in Fallout 76 for now; I can play if I feel like it."
---
Really the only thing i cant get back is the father winter helmet which is tied to my player so as soon as they make that craftable ill have it all back. But it just sucks
---
Personally I think the release of the secret service armor killed all other types of armor grind. Unless it's an absolute perfect set no one wants it anymore and even if all the stars are perfect roll, the type of armor can also play a huge factor.  I only liked combat armor and would turn away a perfect piece of marine simply bc it's dr wasn't as high as combat. Maybe that's just me tho.
---
“Whaaa see 1st is pay to win whaaaa!” 
---
/s
---
Are people trading tse combat rifles for bloodied handmades?I just gave one away but have another tse rifle and lever that I would gladly trade for a b handmade
---
Yup, that's the one
---
It's random. I've seen plenty spawn.
---
Had the same encounter last night. Was finally getting round to the order of the tadpole quests and lost all the bug bits because I figured quickly taking the workshop wouldn’t hurt. Got murdered, lost the bits, quit the server out of frustration, lack of ammo and broken armor. Oh and the guai that kept taking me down while I was trying to avoid getting smushed by the scorchbeast. Not the best time for a stealth sniper build.
---
Prob sorting by things you have mats for and since you don’t, they don’t show up?
---
All you need is one peice of armor with "reduce damage by 15% while blocking" and any if ur gauss shotguns will destroy everything. The damage is glitched (of course : /). Doesnt work in power armor.
---
people are aware of these shadow discounts for small items.
---
there are still other aspects of F1st that they advertised at launch that they still haven't come through on.
---
why someone would defend false advertising and shit on people that just want communication for a product that they paid for is beyond me.
---
From purv and fasnacht, also there’s a couple wastelanders quests that can drop it idk which one but I remember when wastelanders dropped it was groundbreaking news that we could get it from a quest reward.
---
I actually have a nearly full set of Unyielding 1\* wood armor (missing chest) for my power armor/heavy weapons character.  Just for dialogue checks, and the rest of the time it does nothing but also weighs almost nothing.  One man's trash, etc.
---
Are you actually going to the spot to see? Some people dont enable vendors. Or someones camp might be within the boundaries of your camp so it wont load in. I've had that issue. Or maybe they logged off before you could see xD
---
Been happening to me too. Its also why i dont kill things with energy weaps cuz the goo or ash seems to dissapear alot on me
---
I've run into this when playing with a team and getting disconnected. Try to log back into the same server and you can't place your camp because it has reserved the spot - for you. If there is a sudden disconnect and your body persists in the server, you won't be able to place camp because it thinks you are still there.
---
I agree with that. Having recently finishing getting at least the 5x build plans and the jet pack for SS, I don’t see much of a reason to keep my other stuff or continue grinding for upgrades rolls. I have a full unyielding SS set now even with one perfect AP/Sentiel roll. Sometimes I throw my other AP/Sent pieces on so I can max out my jet pack Regen... other than they, everything’s getting sold in my vendor.
---
Lol at ‘Weapon Mugger’ 😀 aka: The Scam Artist..
---
Yeah you only really need 3 or 4 pieces to do all the skillchecks except endurance ones!
---
sorry to say I have dropped it more than once
---
love this idea!
---
Also the companion dailies to find a weapon can reward them if you know the plan
---
So they can sell cosmetic head-wear in the atom shop.
---
I don't know but it's a great 😂😂
---
Did a[little more experimentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/hf2559/death_by_dubstep/)on the topic.  I don't think this is going to go well.
---
Well if you have any heavy combat sentinel. I'm interested. But yeah basically ap is required on a good roll for it to be worth a decent amount.
---
Scout and Secret service armour for the win. Like unless you are specifically torturing yourself like I am with one of my characters secret service fully upgraded has the same resistances as a set of T-45.
---
Correct. I was upset when I noticed nothing had a DR for headwear, but I figured “oh combat armor helmets and army helmets MUST have DR!” Found one for the first time when I was a low level and was so angry. It’s the stupidest thing.
---
Right on, if you wouldn't have minded getting killed while afk then nevermind. I thought you were upset that you weren't able to go afk cause a guy kept messing with you. 
---
Let me revise my response then: being in a pvp zone invites pvp. But sounds like the guy was going the extra mile to be a jerk. There was a recent post about how pve and pvp servers should be completely separated and I totally agree. You weren't having fun as a pve player and the dude giving you grief was probably just bored without competitive pvp.
---
Yes he has it but not all the time.
---
If you’re on PC, I might be able to see what I have around. Haven’t looked at my armor mule in forever
---
ESO, which is not-quite-Bethesda, added something years ago to help out with 4/12-person dungeon loot RNG.  Maybe you finally get the drop you've been wanting (say a Burning Spellweave Inferno Staff), but the trait is Defending instead of Sharpened.  No problem; you collect 50 transmute crystals from various activities and change it to Sharpened, as long as you know the Sharpened trait from doing research.
---
Something similar could be done here.  Even if they wanted to restrict it, they could make a new event that dropped plans for a special workbench, or add it to a bullion vendor.  Then you'd need to buy some kind of bits with scrip (similar to Legendary Modules) that would be consumed when transforming armor.
---
I checked that also,i have a fully stocked scrapbox with every kind of flux, server hopping and killing the sbq 20 times a day gives a lot of flux.
---
Just take the perk "Escape Artist". Armor weight only applies while moving and "Escape Artist" completely nullifes the moving penality. So just go for Unyielding Secret Service Armor + Escape Artist and you can do the same without having to use a stealth boy. Btw. the "Shrouded" armor mod for wood is not working and also "Shadowed" only works on leather armor - AngryTurtle has a test video on that.
---
I remember people would put all of their unwanted legendaries in the icebox outside the golf club entrance..it was amazing
---
except there are more issues with what was advertised with F1st than the discounts. *most* people are aware that there are these secret discounts. that doesn't change the other things that were promised and haven't been mentioned since. also, how do people not get that it is just plain shitty of them to hide these discounts like this. they should be easily identifiable.
---
Lvl 168
---
Save the tokens...reach 100 and exchange for the big reward. Dont waste on the lesser item's
---
Yeah this is some bullshit
---
Light armor has no advantage over heavy armor if you are using "Escape Artist".  Armor weight only applies while moving and "Escape Artist" completely nullifes the moving penality.
---
If you really, truly, very very badly have to pvp in adventure mode, either play hunter/hunted or gtfo
---
Leave the rest of us in peace.
---
Yes, and this is exactly why the legendary effect was removed from the radical face masks as well. I don't care that the excuse was "balance issues" because in reality it would have been suicide for them to compete with best in slot over cosmetic.
---
If not yet doing it, you should get used to always place things with carpets (put a welcome rug, put one leg of the workbench on the side of the rug, move the rug around to place the workbench). This is the only way to cramp things in small spaces.
---
My actual camp has 0 foundation. all workbenches and caches are stuffed in the ceiling of a built-in abandoned house. not on floor but on carpets, themselves lying on the wood beams.
---
Eh bloodied builds have their own problems. Like don't get me wrong those dudes can one shot people and have like 15+ in all special stats but honestly it comes at the cost of potentially dying in one hit and because the game thinks you can't fast travel you can only respawn at Vault 76.
---
"It just works"
---
I still occasionally find myself with that kind of optimism, then I have to remind myself that 76 is being worked on by a skeleton crew
---
Rerolling pieces using legendary modules would be a helpful addition, but I’m worried about the bugs that would get introduced.  Even if it was 3 modules for one of the perks, I’d definitely sink my scrip into fine tooling some of my gear.
---
It does get frustrating just sitting there with your fists out while she bombs some random guy on a tent for ten minutes, when you could be doing 2k damage a hit if she landed. Last time she was constantly bombing we all got on mic and asked the people up high to get down. Worked eventually. 
---
Heavy guns are just so satisfying, even if you're not doing maximum damage that 50 cal just makes you feel like Rambo or the minigun like Blaine from Predator, just mowing them down
---
Oddly enough Tattered Mole Head still has a DR 1
---
I want one called Backhand, that's a random tail or an actual arm that replaces your melee when you have a gun.  So you'd have a scorpion stinger, deathclaw tail or a weird long arm that backhands the enemy.  Takes increased AP, for increased unarmed damage, may fall off in battle and take x amount of time to regrow, during with you have no melee.  I think it would be hysterical.  Everyone walking around with dumb tails slapping stuff.  LOL.
---
Definitely robot armor plans - couple hundred hours in game and I can't finish this quest. Also plasma grenades plan I think?
---
The good thing about this game is that the legendary item grind is optional. I don’t have all the time in the world to play either. I’m only level 78 but I’m already 1-2 shotting most enemies with just my 1 Star gauss rifle.
---
where is your base..?
---
Sorry it's collecting not collection
---
Tattered mole head imba pls nerf
---
MEAT Week!
---
Just started with my heavy guns build, doing decent damage dispite not having enough levels for the perks yet though.
---
The workaround I use with my unarmed build is I jetpack up to punch her if she's hovering in just the right sweet spot... or to vats home in on her as she swoops, have killed her a couple of ways like that, so funny!
---
wallpaper doesnt take up budget
---
You're probably on the other extreme where you expect to build a multi level mansion called C.A.M.P &amp; has the word mobile in its name.
---
No, only Purveyor, some seasonal events (Fasnacht as mentioned), and finally your Ally's daily quest (24hr cooldown it seems) can drop the fixer. This is assuming you **KNOW** the fixer plan. This holds true for all weapons/armor that require the plan to roll it, so the "expansion weapons" such as The Fixer, Sheepsquatch staff and club, Bow, Composite bow, Secret Service armor, etc.
---
You are right. I was having a conversation with someone else just before I saw your response and I realize I know a few people in their late 30s that can act somewhat like what has been described here :/
---
Level 3?
---
There’s a build glitch but that leaves people vulnerable to having their stuff taken, unless they patched it and I don’t know
---
Those are the weapon classes to use with Vanguard.
---
Sure they won't hit as hard, but you have substantially more survivability.
---
It's been over a month since Beckett did more than sell drinks.
---
Hopefully you didn't struggle with it. Never seen a SB that low of a level.
---
My camp is pretty sizable and has plenty of decorations and lights. My budget is full but I live my camp
---
Assuming they meant 3-star
---
what's the one coming soon? if its the season system that completely free, they have already said its free.
---
Don't forget the artillery and the recon scope
---
Greed / Lazy they cant program the store to check
---
Are you using a suppressed weapon?
---
If not, there's your problem. The stealth mechanics are balanced around you having a suppressor.
---
They
---
WHAT?
---
Yes, of course. All my weapons are surpressed.
---
Watch they'll release [Mascot Head](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mascot_head) from Fallout 4 with a DR 2 for the Atom shop.
---
Anytime I see someone standing on mine I move it just to mess with them. It’s funny hearing them scream into the microphone in area chat. F’em.
---
I've only ever got a few lucky hits in on SBs like that, great idea if you can get it just right though
---
Are you going bloodied or otherwise?
---
Well not even anymore Bill Gates retired.
---
Can't upvote this enough.
---
They will come back, everything does at some point.
---
This would be an atrocity of which the likes Appalachia has never seen
---
No? The purveyor list is bugged for metal Left leg.
---
It rolls:
---
- Metal left leg Light
---
- Raider left leg Sturdy
---
- Raider left leg Heavy
---
Modding the gear is a good solution when they don't give a fuck about rng.
---
Go to a train station and click on the Sheepsquatch poster. Follow the questline and listen to the holotapes.
---
Would you happen to be in stealth when you didn't see the notifications?
---
Bloodied on all of my builds so far, but am trying to shift my heavy guns over to junkies so it can be a proper tank, am just making use of Adrenal reaction to make up the low dps until I get a suitable weapon!
---
Dirty &amp; clean green versions are standard I think. At least I've never found anything else in world I don't think.
---
I have one that's camo as well, pretty sure that was an atom shop skin though.

Trade does really blow in this game. Its the most stressful part about it for me. All i can say is use trade groups with a karma system and only trade with reputable people, or make them go first, no exceptions. If I get a guy with no karma in any discord/Reddit server I make them go first. If they decline, have a nice day.
---
There’s also a shadow one that’s black

J47 it's been [20] years can you please come to section... Interrupting for an important announcement the cafeteria now sells Pioneer Scout cookies! Flavors are available in Mint, Chocolate and Bran. Get your Pioneer Scout cookies today!
---
J47 calling J47.
---
Sleep, cranberry relish, and whatever INT buffs you can muster (I use Scorchbeast Brain and Berry Mentats, but they're not easy to acquire on a lowbie). The relish recipe is available at the whitespring food vendor and is relatively easy to farm (you can get cranberries at Aaron holt homestead in the northwest forest region).
---
Purveyor or ally quest can drop the fixer.  
---
Or any event BES decides to put the purveyor pool in it.  Example that parade event we had couple weeks ago
---
TIL ore nodes are supposed to turn into Ultracite when they are nuked similar to flora.
---
Yeah. Truly.  Im not god.
---
I don’t like this. Would hurt trading too much.
---
I want a super mutant mutation lol. Turns us green and gives us 500 rad resist and +5 strength but -10 intelligence and agility.
---
Yeah? where did you find that one? I wouldn't mind one for the collection.
---
Not really, why does Bethesda sell house building bundles then? 🤔
---
I don't have audio but it just has the funny plastic sound when you bit stuff it's pretty hilarious being in a SBQ fight and someone is running and jumping around with their pink baseball bat one hitting scorched. Always entertaining.
---
They just scream and shoot their bloodied explosive weapons at you and your tent enough to block your vision.
---
I bought it in a vendor several months ago so I have no idea how to get it.
---
You need acid for the smelting though.
---
And you can only wear one.
---
God. Awesome.  Its much better than chameleon.  You can move stealthed.  You don't need dr when you don't get hit
---
Thank you, kind sir!
---
Frogs sell really well
---
Yes but evil me thinks that they could just offer atom shop variants with dr/er as well, if the normal item was not as cool looking as the atom shop one people would still buy it and it would not be considered pay to win.
---
It’s not supposed to be random though, I’m pretty sure this is something that needs to be looked into
---
As someone who doesnt play this every day of their life i appreciate the repeats. Gives me hope i might get that alarm clock one day
---
Yes, myself and a friend who have a large collection are noticing that they "disappear" from our stashes and other odd behavior such as our display cases getting "wiped" out. In all cases so far, they have been visual bugs, as the items do return themselves after a few hours/server hops/stash assignment/IDK BETHESDA PLEASE FIX THIS things. So hope they come back for you (on PS4 btw).
---
In the meantime I'm just keeping the guns I need on me, and dealing with near 300lbs weight on me at all times making slotting damage perks in Str pretty frustrating.
---
Yeah that's what you need to do to make it useful. You can use the excavator power armor to mine more per ore node you come across.
---
The shadow one sounds like a musthave
---
Downvoted by losers who can't afford it cause they went settlers
---
A friend of mine had the got the game when it was pretty new so I tried playing a little of it at his place. I didn't like it because it seemed lonely. Initially there was zero npc interaction and that annoyed me since I loved basically feel in love with fallout 4. I played 4 to 100% and then restarted it to play a different faction. When it updated I decided to get it and it's pretty fun now but at first it was a pretty big disappointment.
---
They fell through the map.
---
If you are on PC, you can replace the meat piles with Trinity Tower so they're large enough to poke up out from the abyss
---
Cool, must be doable somehow then. I'll keep my eye out.
---
Yeah it looks sweet and goes really well with the marine armor
---
You don’t need stealth to not get hit either. But I know what you mean. It all comes down to preference.
---
SS armor needs no rep.  Its not a raider/settler reward.
---
Not really.  I've died maybe once accidentally?
---
&gt;would not be considered pay to win.
---
You underestimate the whine of the p2w crowd
---
Teslas are perfect here - our crew will run this event in this fashion - we get approx 1000 steel each (using scrapper) from the weapons the scorched drop here too!
---
LOL! wishful thinking.. 
---
 Got same problem,  not moving my camp..been here since beta..
---
New info for me! Thanks for sharing and my god will i make my FO1st friends do that.
---
Of course you may, thank you so much! My Twitter is @teawithakoko :)
---
Looked it up and found [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VbFJ8wzeIyA) video
---
Thanks.  I find it funny the downvotes. With all the 76 bugs I basicly forgot about them.  And you downvote me because I didn't expect them to figure things out?
---
\*whispers\* you know there is more than fallout out there.  And some of it is quite good!
---
That also makes them respawn invincible with no ai
---
Yeah, some people call these "magic" shotguns.
---
There's a few other legendary shotgun effects that cause the same game-breaking damage in VATS; Limb damage, bash damage, VATS accuracy, Medic's, and Junkie's. I hope I haven't missed any.
---
It is
---
Oh so this is not a bug its an exploit.
---
I have Quad ffr one if you are interested
---
I use a heavy gunner build with all of the shotgun perks and the quad is by far my favorite weapon during a multi enemy fight. And if you go into third person and start shooting you can rapid fire that thing pretty quick however charging it before a shot is usually really good, it does much more damage.
---
I never noticed tbh. I've scrapped loads of combat armor, maybe I CAN do other colours and just haven't realised. Thanks for the link.
---
Sure its useful, you reload much less. Does it surpass Junkie in damage? No. DPS? No thanks to charge times do the math. Clearing? Maybe. If you can properly spec to kill most enemies in 1 hit, without charging, then its worth it! Vats becomes a great clearing method and only the tough guys that require a charge really lower the clear rate. Junkies is overkill for alot.
---
And now for devils advocate. If you want clear time? Don't use a Gauss, just use a lever action.
---
According to fo76 help entries light armor reduces the noise of movement. Therefore making sneaking better.
---
I am a stealth rifleman. Wearing heavy armor seems silly to me.
---
Doesn't matter to me, nothing ever sees me to hit me. Id go naked if it werent for legendary bonuses.
---
Sounds like a driver crash or corruption on fallout 76. remove the webcam and reinstall drivers.
---
I meant that, didn't knew how to discribe it, mb.
---
Wiki and YouTube are best for this.
---
Man I always fall back on the classics. Mainly kotor 1 and 2. And fable tlc. Those are my go to games when Im bored
---
Yeah. I've been noticing that too. People think that rarity is everything. I like to have rare prefixes, but I'm not paying a crazy amount for them. I usually get mine off of cheap trades. When new stuff comes out people will always overpay for it on the first few days. I take advantage of that. During fasnacht I got 3 legacies off of people desperate for rare masks
---
He repeats a lot of funny lines from Fallout 3/4. He’ll also calls out “communist detected” when threats are in your vicinity, so it kept me from getting ambushed by creatures quite a bit in my wandering. But like any meme, it gets tired with continued use. You’ll probably find yourself using it, putting it away for a while, and digging it out every now and again when the mood hits. I don’t regret buying it, because it was one of the better made Atom Shop cosmetics, but it’s not something I feel compelled to use all the time.
---
What are they going to nerf, the glitch?  Nerfing this boat anchor would really be a slap in the face.   I at least wish I could two hand swing it like Davey Crocket and look cool smashing scorched in the jaw.   Fuck it I guess I’ll be better off with a rolling pin.   No wonder I never see people using them.  Thanks Bethesda.
---
I guess I do it for RP. Wearing heavy armor as a stealth rifleman seems silly.
---
Nothing ever sees or hits me so doesnt matter what i wear.
---
So I guess i do it for rp .
---
I gotta agree with this. I mainly use an Instigating shotgun, with, I think, double damage if enemy in full health, limb damage, and bashing damage, and wasn't using VATs much, mainly out of ignorance. Out of pure amusement, I do the Tipsy Taste quest a lot, and one of those is getting a critical strike on an enemy, so I was using VATs and noticed a buttload more damage being done. Now I use it quite a bit, and noticing taking down big boys in 2-3 shots when it used to take 10 or even more shots. Still not ideal, but I lov-a da shotguns.
---
I use the helmet on a couple of power armor sets I have, when it's alerting you to an enemy properly it works really good.
---
Okay Karen.
---
Yea I now them all. I can craft them, and therefore have unlocked the ability to learn different paint jobs by scrapping combat armor (not helmets) which I've done to the max.
---
Learn to make them, scrap normal combat armor, learn the helmet paints.
---
Don't know the combat helmet plan? Scrap helmets to learn it, then STOP scrapping helmets as they don't benefit you further. Its not sure chance but you can learn it with a chance.
---
This! Search this sub Reddit for ini settings, my pip boy is a nice white light. 
---
I believe the overpriced Secret service helmet also gives a headlamp. But I'm sure no one wants that.
---
If you are going to try the ini, also try the option to disable grass, and give it a try.
---
haha, nobody at microsoft has pals
---
good try though
---
Sorry, already got one
---
*Team Fortress 2 enters the area*
---
Probably. I play on console so that might be it. We have only had 1 or 2 major dupe waves, and even then not many people actually dupe legacies. I imagine PC is different.
---
No worries!
---
Or instead of that garbage route.  BGS should make a proper trade window like every game for the past 10 years +.
---
Thats why i keep mine!
---
I've seen angry turtles science videos on the topic, but need actual numbers as I hope to build a dynamic calculator to assist with builds, as well as "Worth it DR/ER" v.s. "actual DR/ER achievable" given any loadout.
---
Wouldn't vampiric really shine with vanguard though?
---
I mean vampiric is good all around but if staying at or close to full health with minimal effort...vampire would do that wonderfully. Not as strong...and again vampiric works with everything in a pinch...but you would be pretty much....extra immortal.
---
Would be neat if at full health the vanguard set also had the capability to draw aggro making it so if you really wanted to tank through an event vampiric and vanguard would be amazing. 
---
Just spitballing.
---
Yeah it's gotta be bloodied if you wanna do damage. Tried to switch between bloodied to Vanguard/Furious and it was like switching the difficulty to hard mode on FO4 and immediately doing much less damage to everything. Nah. 
---
If you're heavy guns and PA, the Emergency Protocols mod is incredible for Bloodied and really makes you a tank at low health. Just gotta watch out for poison damage and miniguns and keep an eye on your health. Trust me, you'll be killing enemies so fast they won't have time to do much damage if you're paying attention
---
Yep and I wish they would fix it.
---
Did one the other day on public with about 10 players all on the walls and the scorched all spawned kinda midair in the middle. It was hilarious. A great time to have a tesla too.
---
I, for one, would welcome a Deathclaw mount.  Use the existing ‘tame’ creature abilities and voila!  
---
“And I thought they smelled bad on the outside!”
---
No..the chest piece is where the voice comes from...not the helmet
---
Ok karen
---
Not that I’ll be much of a help, as I’m only level 17. But I’ve been running a hunting rifle stealth build and have found it to be very enjoyable. High intelligence, agility, and perception allow to you to  utilize VATS bonuses and many gun mods. Rifles are largely useless unless you pair the stealth crits with it. It’s super beneficial when any enemy that engages you is at half health before they even see you. Just hit them for the 2x critical shot, and then finish them off with VATS when they get closer.
---
I'm proud of him too, how embarrassing for the level 24. Waxed by a 9 year old. Top stuff.
---
Then watch it get removed within days cause someone learned how to duplicate weapons
---
Time to build a camp made only from foundation walls and disdain.
---
&gt;you can replace the meat piles with Trinity Tower
---
Ya do what now. Just a mod which replaces the model I guess? Sounds kind of jarring to see?
---
Ok Karen
---
???
---
I’ve seen this mentioned before but never experienced it. As a full health junkie I can empty 25 rounds in the sbq and get loot. If this were true I’d get nothing.
---
System?
---
The older I get the more I get this in general regarding games. I think it's just burnout, been there shot that, stabbed it got the t-shirt, etc. 
---
After a break I'm always ready to go again though. Maybe go do something else for a bit and then come back.
---
Whenever I see that message, I usually just hit the option to stay in that game and don't have my camp placed. I always go check out who's in "my spot" and sometimes send them a "dood, you're in my spot!" message which some get, and the ones that don't, get all huffy. Then I server jump to another world and camp is where it always is. Safe.
---
I like building on the smaller side as well, although the smallest I'm willing to tolerate is a 2x2 space.
---
I think if someone plays in 1st person, they can get around a tight CAMP a lot better, but I don't.
---
I just realized how bad my tse Gauss Rifle I never use sucks just like this shotgun.  Full rifle perks, tank killer, covert for sneak damage, demo expert, over 500 damage........crosshairs perfectly between the eyes of day dreaming super mutant........release projectile!!!!    Cloud of dust and -25% health.   It’s like the gun shoots  clumps of bird shit.   Bird shit that doesn’t even mildly sting the eyes on impact.
---

---
If you’re ps4 i’m pretty sure i have a plasma grenade plan you can have
---
Yeah I play on PS4, that'll be helpful thanks, my current loadout on my heavy weapons alt is an Anti Armor Gattling gun for general purpose killing, and an Instigating Gattling plasma for bigger targets.
---
You could also offer services.  
---
Like put up a sign that says buying whatever random item is code for letting them revive you.
---
It happens, I can't tell you how many times I've done that but you will find your motivation again
---
Is that what was happening? Dang dude there really is less and less reason to use energy weaps these days.... : /
---
Most MMOs let you hide the head slot now. FO76 just bypasses them needing to code a special case for gear to apply stats but be hidden on the character model. Since head gear doesn't offer stats, you can wear what you want, or nothing at all (with the exception of situations needing gas masks).
---
I used to constantly lose gear on PC. It happened when I was constantly changing perks.
---
What happened was:
---
First press Tab to bring up pip boy which happens to be on my worn items menu.  
---
Press T to edit perks but accidentally press 'RT' due to being keyboard neighbors.  
---
The R drops the item and the T immediately opens the perk menu and plays obnoxious music.  
---
This hides both the visual and audio cue of dropping an item.
---
So there you have it. A perfect combination of several lacking design decisions enabled a very easy and genuine mistake to be made very often.
---
This is the most unintentionally dirty thing I've ever read.
---
In a similar sense, why isn't there a power armor display?
---
Makes absolutely no sense to me.
---
Not sure about an entire DLC, that'd probably be too much, but a questline with some more alien-related stuff to obtain would definitely nice. Was very disappointed when I finished being Daguerre's fetchboy and all I got for it was a lv20 blaster. Aliens fit the world very well, and no, they don't have to be comical either. The flatwoods monster just doesn't cut it.
---
MEEEEEET
---
I am constantly in this state. I look at my libraries for hours, sometimes i decide to install something, fallout4, gta5, skyrim, w.e sometimes i let the game install, launch, then close and uninstall. Othertimes i stop the install halfway through and uninstall.
---
The gamers dilema, constant search for a new fun fresh game, but after this many years playing thousands of games dozens of genras, even new games get old quickly.
---
Sad state we find ourselves in brother, a sad state indeed.
---
Bethesda, just give these little wankers seperate PvP worlds and be done with them.
---
Be careful with your giant Mr. Fuzzy, he can be scrapped from your stash if you don't have other resources or if you are a fo1st member, junk gets taken from your stash before your scrap box.  I lost 2 giant Mr. Fuzzys due to scrapping :(
---
Should kids be playing Fallout? Violence aside I believe the way the game pokes fun at the concept of addiction is quite dangerous imho
---
I use the swift Capacitors for the extra 1 shot and reload speed. The damage is so high the armor piercing from the other mods doesnt do much.
---
I looked into it more and a video by oxhorn on YouTube. There he lays out the reasonings for why it could be her, and why it might just be a coincidence. It was pretty interesting. I posted the link, or you can just go to YouTube and look up oxhorn and it's the flatwoods monster video. https://youtu.be/gZevTQxjGKA
---
Depending on your level if you are lower level Acid can be a problem to get and ore has a lot of weight to smelt into useful scrap.  I would only go after ore that has strategic value to what you need for crafting.  Black Titanium for instance to make Excavator Armor is a good investment and there are spots to get that and a workshop has a resource spot that is good to farm.
---
There are more mobs now that drop acid so do a little homework so you are balancing mining with a way to smelt.  
---
I usually take all Ore and store it in my storage as it starts to take up valuable wt on your character.  Every now and then I go smelt as much as I can to keep the weight down.
---
I think he’ll be fine, especially since he’s just killing and building without looking into the deeper mechanics.
---
This is brilliant! &lt;3 I became a tadpole today and I can see already that the road is long, with many a  jelly gathering.
---
He only plays it with my supervision. I skip through any dialogue that isn't age appropriate. The violence is really so cartoonish I'm not overly concerned about it.
---
I get like this way too frequently. I cycle between the Sims, Fallout 4 &amp; 76 and RDR2 but there are days where none are appealing. So, I feel you I guess is what I'm trying to say.
---
I have encountered it twice. Once on the cliffs where the ski slope is on your way to top of the world, and once at that pond you can find when you leave fallout 76 and head towards the lumbermill. Each time when I shot it it fled. so I don't know what happens when you actually fight/ defeat one.
---
VATS doesn't work great with the flamer barrel. It's really powerful and fun to use manually though. For as far as your build I'd get rid of thru-hiker and either max out your Adreneline or replace it with Gun-Fu. And I'd use Radicool for that one point in Endurance.
---
I saw him quite a few times during fasnacht, helvetia may be a good start. Just a suggestion :)
---
Yeah, this happens to me too. I wish we had some type of transaction history to see what sold.
---
Honestly, I never had luck finding them in vendors (and I spent a lot of time trying), but through a random /fo76 reddit post found someone who had a bunch.  Sold for 125caps each, which was incredibly generous given how much work it saved me.  Good luck hunting!
---
You could try fo76 marketplace, but unless you have something interesting to trade, don't hold your breath - people who have a lot of stable flux aren't usually hurting for caps or ammo - they are looking for godrolls.
---
Should be at the Vendor bot at Harper's ferry or Watoga I think, I'm pretty sure at any rate. 
---
I'll have to check if I have it when I get home, I think I do. If so and you're on PC I'll happily mod some for you.
---
I’m very pleased with all the changes dev has made to counter griefing.
---
Thumbs up for the Demolition Man referance.
---
3 shots?  All it takes for mine to bring down a lvl 91 deathclaw is a single shot.  I've got all the shotgun perks, along with the perk cards which gives you less spread and an extra 15% critical damage.  It's a quad too so basically in any situation I'm a killing machine.
---
I'd go 3 points in better criticals, and definitely try pick up critical savvy, i don't think 3\* serendipity is necessary either as most the time you wont have any incoming damage to actually avoid haha, also gun fu &gt; thru hiker, and maybe drop a couple points from sneak and try get rejuvenated, the well hydrated bonus is also pretty good for ap regen, i also only use one point in concentrated fire, even with 3 points in it vats is still buggy and you'll occasionally miss those '95%' chance shots.
---
I have some chameleon armor I always wear, so it's very possible I was sneaking and invisible.
---
Totally down with repair - if you blow out a wall to fry me with flamethrowers or your Tesla arcs burn themselves out, I'm all for it.
---
If you need to be there to go into build mode and delete a foundation or build a blueprint wall of punji boards ... yeah ... up your game
---
Let the newbies get the past free items too, geez
---
We have plenty of new things coming up when the seasons thing drops
---
See, now this is funny
---
The plasma flamer is for close quarters mob control, it has very limited range so you won’t really need vats with it.  Use the plasma flamer as a mob control method when you are overrun by enemies; snipe with another gun and use the flamer when you get detected and overrun.
---
You bet
---
I only encountered it once in the red landscape before the Brotherhood city (sorry it’s been a while so I can’t remember names of the places). I stood in front of it and my party all transported to me to see it then we proceeded to kill. I can’t remember what it dropped I just remember being sad it wasn’t an alien blaster.
---
which vendor are you going to? It's at the command one behind the grid in the Military Wing.
---
Appreciate that but I’m on Xbox, also just trying to learn all the plans for the sake of it lol
---
Guess I’ll keep server hopping, ty for info
---
Come to think of it, every vault boy picture regarding radiation has this. Why have we not gotten this yet, even its its purely cosmetic...
---
NYGERUNDAYOOO
---
I’m level 190, and have been rocking leather since launch with my heavy explosive junkie. Have a full heavy leather vanguard set, but usually wear 1 chameleon for the occasional PvP... Highest ER in the game... too bad most enemies don’t use energy weapons. It also looks the best, IMO.
---
Ahhh, that's a known issue then. If you weren't sneaking that's something new entirely. Can you keep me updated if this happens to you again?
---
Dense Marine has a 0.43% chance to appear in vendors in Ash heap, Mire, Cranberry Bog
---
Dense Trapper same chance and vendors as above.

I last tested it on patch 18 and it still hadn't been fixed (assuming it's unintended), if your target is in combat the sneak multiplier doesn't trigger. tested it on a public SBQ and in my private world, the multiplier never triggered in the public fight and in the private one it only triggered after I killed the crabs the SBQ had engaged.
---
damage numbers reflect this. can't comment on the team thing, but I don't think it matters if the mob is engaged to something, anything.
---
Thank you very much! Do you also have an instagram or just twitter?
---
Upvote because griefing = roleplaying comment is valid
---
That is what I do, I like to be working on something but not so impossible that there is almost no chance to get it.  I took about a month off from Fallout76, as PS4 performance was horrible and I just couldn’t play it, but once it got stable I got back into it again.  I like I can craft most things it just takes time and I am in no rush.  Eventually I have gotten good weapons and have not been forced to trade for them, but have bought some at times.  
---
That said it is why for me buying 1st was a no brainer.  A new game cost $50-60 and you get 10-12 hours.  Buying a year of first with Tent, junk storage and private worlds I have played 100’s of hours.  How many new games is that no brainer.  I don’t mind if I take a week off, but I try to keep up on what is going on, always learn something I didn’t know was in the game!
---
5 points for you
---
Oh yeah? Care to share the peace and quiet?
---
You're right it is 2018
---
What would I do with the 100's of fasnacht Maks in my stash waiting to be sold off.
---
Making Fallout more serious seems also very unlikely if you consider the fact that all Vaults in Fallout 4 and the entire color palette isn't event remotely as dark as the earlier versions.
---
a dead player in a body of water?
---
Absolutely!  I just started fallout 76 a few weeks ago.  Also just joined Reddit.   Everything is new!
---
Lazy coding
---
Nice I am using that sheet currently and wondering if anything’s changed, just seems to be my luck is horrendous atm. No Wallace, I’m here for your dense plans not you’re soothing voice pal
---
He doesn't seem to have a set path, he has the paths he takes, but to be honest it seems like he randomly chooses his path out of those destinations, over also seen him off the road traveling into the whitesprings golf course.
---
My suggestion is set your camp somewhere on the roads he walks and hope he passes. Sorry.
---
I just finished the 3 for tadpole but wouldn't mind getting the other badges
---
Same here I never noticed and haven’t seen anyone running around, but I have scrapped a lot of combat armor!  I will check it out tonight
---
When did they say you could walk to the capital wasteland? I watched those reveal videos over and over again for months and don't remember that. Could you get a link where they said that? I'm not being a dick just really curious if I actually missed or forgot something like that
---
I found him at Crater a couple of times, chilling near the bar. Maybe server hop when there.
---
Just Twitter!
---
This is on your radar but SBQ is still buggy as all hell and I still can’t sort my aid by spoil rate. Those are just the 2 most annoying ones you have decided aren’t worth your time. One of them is only the main end game boss ffs
---
It is stupid and boring (and additionally nonsensical) to pay for fast travel at all. who the hell are we paying? the invisible magic fast travel fairy? we never had to pay for this shit before in fallout (or most other beth games), so it's dumb (but more importantly to me -- it literally doesn't make any logic-based sense) we have to now...
---
This would devalue heavy legendary rolls and increase value of light/sturdy. I love it. Less RNG grind please.
---
My god! Look at that damage. Very nice.
---
They used a glitch I’m sure.
---
I participated in an event this was going on several months ago.
---
As I started to get ready out in front of the barracade, an extremely high level  motioned me back inside the ballistic dividers.... to my surprise-when it started, they were all spawning at the sonic blaster...we had a mountain of bodies by the time LIS ended.
---
Every since then- everytime LIS started, I would briefly wonder about how that happened that day. Now I know- thank you.
---
Agree I switched from melee to shotgun lately on both my primary characters and wreck everything.  It is fun
---
Good points thanks!
---
Yup , just [throwing a grenade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faGDDmn9kXQ) I was getting like 2k xp each spawn.
---
Yeah, me too 😂
---
Not really much else you can do apart from server hopping unfortunately. The chance is so low that you might be at it for a while.
---
Okay good to know! Maybe I'll ditch it and just run commando then, since rifles seem to lag behind a bit
---
MEEEEEEAAAAAAAAT
---
Imma hop in to see if there are any good trades, ty all ill try to do all the new stuff that comes in
---
Was wondering why they were all spawning there. last time i done the event XD
---
True. Ty for info
---
I might have to get vr and play beatsaber or something, i think the mediums were used to are just played out. Time for a new way to play maybe?
---
It was a late night session I was by myself. Wondering the wastes. I am low level. And then from nowhere a hail of bullets flys towards me I turn around it is a 3 star sentry bot. I give it everything I got im low on ammo and stims then after a 15 minute fight my pistols slide kicked back one more time as the bullet fired from the chamber blowing black powder dust every where the bullet hit that sentry right where it hurts in the fusion core. I heard it take its final breath but then almost like thanos he disappeared i thought I won. I should of aimed for the head i thought as I reloaded my pistol with the last of my bullets one tear shed from my eye the war is over i lost .
---
Yeah, I saw this happend during the double xp weekend. Got almost 3k xp in each wave.
---
the most times i've seen grahm have been around Sunshine meadows Industrial Farm
---
Found him a couple of times in the early days of the game in random places. Then i made a new character and put my camp on that junk pile near there. Everytime i logged on i'd capture that workshop. In a couple of days i saw him like 6-7 times. Also around billings homestead workshop as well. Oh and twice near Charleston station recently when i was levelling another alt. I lured the grafton monster to him and let them fight.
---
I did
---
Ive seen hum at the whitesprings station, on the parking next to the tent, hope you find it someday
---
Try a trading sub to buy the flux. You're gonna need about 200 caps each. Alternatively, theres a weekly right now for gathering nuked flora, so people will likely be launching more nukes than usual. A good whitesprings run with Green Thumb should net you everything you need.
---
[plays drums]
---
I set my 8yo up at sanctuary in fallout 4 with a ton of building mods and let him go to town. One day he asked what to do in the institute. He'd managed to get 3/4 of the way through the main quest under my radar.
---
On PC?
---
1) Get Archive2 from Creation Kit install
---
2) Extract "SeventySix - Startup.ba2"
---
3) curvetables/json/creatures/weapon/

It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Legendary sentry bots seem to do that almost aways when I’m playing, but I don’t remember it ever happening to me with any other creatures.
---
Also keep some ingredients or recipes used for Biv daily alcohol quests.
---
Even plant some blackberry, corn, muttfruit plants which can be used to craft alcohol.
---
Why drink purified water when you can craft beer? - junkies
---
The point of the game is to survive the apocalypse, not mass killing without purpose like any other fps game.
---
Take part in the Lighthouse (Mothman) Public Event.  Firefly abdomens scrap to Acid.
---
It's less than a 1 in 200 chance so dont feel too bad. That's a lot of hopping.
---
Why no 4th of July Independence Day event? As in the movie?
---
Not on PC? I've been working on a spreadsheet with all of this info
---
I have a pulse flamer but haven't really used it much. It was fun to mess around with a huge magazine, but it didn't do well in vats. I mostly made it just in case they fix the glitch and it becomes a legacy mod. You may want to confirm which perks actually effect it when modded that way as I thought the flamer barrel was effected by rifleman rather than commando like you might think.
---
Bold of you to assume they will give us another expansion the size of Dupelanders.
---
Thanks i'll try that!
---
I'm proud too that father-son are having good time playing games, keep it up boi 🦾
---
That would have been. I know you can find a blaster up north, as I have it. But, picking one of the alien would have been a cool find
---
Have you used glitches to get your C.A.M.P over budget? I know it can cause a lot of bugs like these to happen.
---
There’s a dead alien I found in the back of a dump truck somewhere south near the savage divide. I have a photo of it but I am not by my ps at the moment.
---
Haha pve players worst nightmare
---
It is rifle man. And yeah its been terrible for vats lol
---
Really? That's cool!! I'm going to look into that!!
---
Yeah chicken royale is a1
---
Yeah, make sure you’re going to the correct vendor station, there are 3 or 4 different ones inside the bunker. The one with scout armor mods is the one upstairs inside the military wing.
---
That shit is so hard to find....
---
I totally agree, give people choice don't try to force people in to liking things they hate, it never work!!!
---
The grind IS the game, folks. They aren't going to make it any more rewarding.
---
MEAT WEEK!! 🥓🥩🍗🍖🦴
---
You'll generally spawn roughly NE of wherever your camp module is positioned. There is some variation to this, but it's always a roughly NE orientation.
---
If you're on Xbox I have the plans for sale.
---
I downvoted me too lol, hey It's an unpopular opinion, cant deny that 😃
---
I check out their camps and if they have vending machines those too.  Last week had a person in my spot with a bunch of 2 star weapons priced 8,000 - 10,000 caps each...not even god roll 2 stars either, pretty much just junk.
---
This is not a location that is even good for vending either.  Too far out of the way to get good traffic and expensive to travel to quite often as it's basically in a corner of the map.  Hopefully I don't get people seeing a vendor up there and thinking "that's the dude with stupid prices, I'm not going there" lol.
---
Ok well I can see where your coming from about need more consequence for a death but I still dont agree with buffing damage on high health biulds cuz like I said you have to choose between damage and damage resistance or every person in the game would have non PA vanguard biuld and customization would go right out the window
---
I was wondering why they kept spawning in a circle and dropping right there. 
---
Like fish in a barrel.
---
Yes I'm PS4 mostly but have access to the PC. Can you share the spreadsheet? I can self teach the Archive2 thing but gonna need to find the download
---
I want to shoot this woman dead every time I visit someones came to check vendors and she's there. Everything she says is so god damn annoying, why would anyone ever choose her!? Gramps or bust.
---
There's a no audio paint?
---
I didn't know if the rifleman was an old glitch that had been fixed or if that was really what should effect it. Thanks for confirming it's still that way in case I ever try to use my Anti-Armor Anti-Power Armor plasma flamer again.
---
I was too busy enjoying the other glitch that was the 3rd person Gatling gun fire speed at the time, so sad to see that one patched.
---
Yeah I found him there the other day, in the middle of a nuke zone.
---
No? I don't know? I just build stuff and my camp is AT budget alot because friends do stupid things like hide cactus in my base and I only ever notice when its time to build something for the daily/weekly atom challenges and cant...
---
Had to grind for it in Settler rep, bullion, and blood!
---
(URGENT)
---
Bethesda were really asking right now!!!
---
So the tent dictates where they spawn?
---
Some Raider in the crater talks about Zetans in detail... dialog tree and interesting lore about the space station...
---
Holy mother of god, that is a nice drop.
---
Light Step + Power Armor or Chinese Stealth Suit invalidates 99% of all trap camps. Immune to punjis, rad damage, and fall damage. Only thing that could potentially kill you would be getting dropped onto an acid node, but that is a slow death and you can easily alt+f4.
---
I've never actually seen it work.
---
Is that why I sometimes find decent gear on the ground =0
---
This has been my main steel scrap farm lately. After spending 5 min for the event, 15 minutes picking up all the loot and then a slow trek to the work bench inside Fort Defiance usually yields between 1200-1600 Steel Scrap depending on how many enemies I hit. I am expecting this to be fixed in the June 30th(?) update. Now that it is on this subreddit, I look for Bethesda to have visibility on it for sure and have it fixed.
---
The companion dailies.
---
Is that definite? Has nothing in the atom shop ever been pulled and vaulted permanently?
---
Meh for the age I bet this is backwards
---
Run th collision course event at morgantown airport.  It often drops a sniper rifle.
---
God no plus atm any of the damage proc mutations can be abused so fuckwads can proc PvP with you.
---
Which is why you have people random whacking away at people all the time
---
No date yet. Will be in season 1 so maybe we will get info about dates in the next Inside the Vault.
---
This is also not ture a junkies biuld with enough addictions has damn near the same damage (only a few points base damage lower) than a bloodied biuld but with the added bonus of haven full health
---
I think the research system from ESO is a happy medium for f76.
---
Research takes long as shit, literally a month for the final traits crafters don't know yet, so that will keep people playing, but it also gives the players some more agency ... and also allows crafting-heavy players to have more to do.

I have it as a passive, it says you can’t remove diseases but must be bugged cause I can either with time or with cures.

I used to have magazine rack, collected all of the mags, and displayed one each of them. 
---
A few weeks later I scrapped the displays and sold all the magazines (including hundreds of duplicates). The camp budget hit was too much.
---
I think it blocks their normals spawns so they default spawn in the middle of the event

Of the few times I've stayed, it was either a  2x2 crap shack or someone's Fo1st tent. Usually not worth the bother.

Well if you have kids you raise yours how you want and don't worry about others decide to raise theirs and you won't have to worry about getting down votes. OP knows his kids maturity level and what they can handle.
---
They have to render in your camp same as any other placeable camp item. They also exist in your stash, so they have to take weight. It makes sense to have it cost both, despite it being sucky.
---
I havent been playing long and didnt even realize he was rare. Ive seen him so many times near the grafton dam (down in the creek bed) that i thought that is just where he lived.
---
Smelt the one you will use. Drop the others, smelting iron is not worth the acid.
---
Just so you know, u/DevastatorDerekK, the Gladiator outfit is back in the Atomic Shop today!
---
Good to know, thanks for the help.
---
i would imagine Bethesda would be able to make public events an exception
---
the tent blocks the spawn point near the 2 holes. So everything has to spawn somewhere else.
---
I imagine that's why sometimes when you fight the SBQ everything spawns underneath it.
---
This video will answer some of your questions: https://youtu.be/iJ0YQJIaVb8
---
But every time you build stuff you risk altering spawn location.
---
No story is ever good without conflict. This game will never be good until it realizes this. If we, the players, are supposed to be making our own story, but there is no threat from other players, then it's a boring story to be told.
---
No way. Then this role playing game might have actual roles to play in it. Instead we have two flavors of DPS depending on how much dying you’re willing to endure.
---
Would you like an apple pie with tha-at? Would you like an apple pie with tha-at?
---
I go there, and for some reason it is almost always empty. I did just uninstall my game entirely and reinstall the other day, and today was the first time it had any mods.
---
Yup, pretty much. Unsure if the new content on 76 is even going to entice me to play "properly".
---
PC then, I assume. Which pieces/mods do you need?
---
You wouldn't be able to get the .ba2 files without a pc install, skip that step

Does the post not naturally bring about the question? When was this about OP's parenting? Should Children be playing Fallout? Why is the Rating system so Puritanical compared to actual modern day values? Should it be completely up to the parent therefore nullifying the need for any rating systems at all?
---
Somebody is a dumbass who lives under a rock. Explosive bait. New griefing tool.
---
It was in the interview with Todd after the reveal he said that. Honestly I thought he was talking out his ass then.
---
Had the same issue, got gold from him a couple times, then tried 1 week and couldnt, thought maybe it had reset earlier then I thought and waited another week, still couldnt buy any
---
There was a lot of interviews. Who was it done with?
---
I am on PS4 actually.
---
No. But you'll have "the weapon you want" while you're trying to get a much better 3 star version. I've been using 1 star bloodied fixer/ handmade for months and they're both great weapons!  I bought them both for relatively cheap (at least compared to 2/ 3 star versions) and now I'm trying to get 3 star versions of both.
---
The one immediately after the reveal during the Bethesda showcase.
---
Probably the best way would to get some people to help.
---
A few people running stretches of his known paths and server hopping before running back is how Ive found him before.
---
My very first rolls were junkies FFR, and Junkies FFR, 90%RW... and scripped immediately as I don’t run junkies.
---
ahh damn, was gonna try and help. Just make sure that you're looking under the "mods" section and not plans and maybe see if you can hop on a friends private server to make sure that it hasn't just been cleared out by another player for some reason
---
Im on pc if you want help
---
I’m a melee; I run with 15 Str 13 Per 3 Chr, 4 Lck
---
I started as a melee/sniper, thus the high PER, over in INT, I run stabilized 3, and in STR, All the usual melee perks, plus bandolier1 and... the card with the picture of a tank)
---
I use (vampire) melee weapons on most everything, but it allows me to swap to heavy guns or rifles as the occasion/enemy demands.
---
Yes, they are, because there isn't one that actually complements it.  Instead, your best option is to use weapons that are equally good no matter what your build is.
---
Yeah, I cleared the Cache, nothing. I cleared the cache and did the rebuild option, nothing. All the while waiting at the press any button screen for a while. Then I deleted the saved data and tried. Nothing. So I’m going to delete it and redownload/reinstall it. If that doesn’t work I guess I should contact Sony/Bethesda.
---
I do... I think my game was bugged. Now seeing the cost of 1000 caps a pop I am like ugh.... Since I want all polymer. I get it though caps are basically useless.
---
I would say that rifles are lots of fun, they aren’t going to compete with commando in the end, but you can still one shot almost anything in the game.  I would suggest running both; which is what I do.  You only need to switch the rifleman cards out for commando when you want to go auto.  
---
That being said I have a plasma for both builds.  I use a primed junkies/ffr/fr plasma as my commando queen killer (it is a crusher). And I use a primed junkies/limb damage/+A plasma flamer with my rifleman build as a crowd control tool.  The flamer is basically a melee range weapon (slightly more but not much).  I think the plasma flamer alone really makes rifles viable.  You can just melt anything!  Especially if you are bloodied or junkies.  
---
If you stick with the plasmas, definitely prime it for ammo efficiency, you get 4 x as much ammo per craft.
---
Because you’re bugging the game to win.
---
It’s like glitching under the map in a world of Warcraft battleground with the flag. 
---
It isn’t the way the devs intended you to win.
---
It’s bullshit.
---
Damn bro, that's me right now as well. I can't even enjoy playing my bass anymore
---
While you are at it, make it look like a dick lol
---
Damage output is trumps though.  So, in an absolute best case, junkie build is 2nd best, and pretty much always has been, and if I'm not mistaken it's also a bit harder to pull off.
---
If it renders, it takes budget; it's as simple as that. The whole point of camp budget is limiting strain on the system.
---
To be clear I didn't downvote or upvote you.
---
My spawn point is a glitch. Half the time I end up in the upside down void beneath the map. I take one step and either fall to my death or spawn in with broken legs. It's crazy.
---
What kind of weapons we talking about?
---
&gt;If you're not a full sneak but would like some aspects of sneak that's probably the armor you would want.
---
Sounds to me like it's the armour for people who don't want to optimise then?
---
You can use an armor pieces with The avoid damage while blocking to break all shotguns so they do insane damage to, doesnt seem to work with furious weapon effect from some testing ive done but from my experience all others are effected by this armor piece. But lets not be to loud about this so bethesda dont patch it
---
One thing Anthem did right was make it so that legendaries went directly into your inventory. We already have the mechanism in place for events that award legendaries. Mobs should be the same.
---
It's actually been functioning like this since launch IIRC
---
How does Chinese stealth suit invalidate any traps?
---
Also things being “easy” is one of the problems this game has. I mean the only thing to do in this fucking game that is fun is to shoot enemies in events, and you want to bug the game so it’s easier?
---
Please stop playing. Not because I’m being an asshole, but because you obviously are not enjoying the game any more.
---
It’s new to us.
---
Idk man, that holotape fucked me up. Story is really fucked at the end.
---
It prevents radiation and most fall damage related deaths. Combined with Light Step, which negates floor traps, you're pretty impervious to traps.
---
You’d know if someone dropped a nuke on your CAMP, the entire server knows whenever a nuke is dropped and it’s a rad zone for 2 hours after. If it was a nuke they’d know
---
Found: Yet another 1* nocturnal rolling pin.
---
Lost: The will to live.
---
Have you tried going back to the area after 5 minutes to see if there's a meat pile to loot? I do get this occasionally and that sometimes works.
---
You might wanna read sub rules
---
I have Fallout 1st.
---
And take out fast travel. You god damned people don’t even want to really play Fallout.
---
Oh I thought maybe I would be able to free up those three sneak points if I switched to light/sturdy.
---
I cover my armor with the hunters long coat any way so I’ve never been that worried about it matching. 
---
Would be nice to make a set look a certain way though.
---
As far as i know the mechanic of blocking a spawn point has been in since day one. They'd have to devise a whole new mechanic for enemies spawning. So if it did get fixed in this update i can guarantee it's something they would have been working on for a while. 
---
but yeah. STEEL FARM BAYBEEEEE
---
I was doing Guided Meditation with 1 other person and we accidently stood in the perfect areas to cause the mobs to spawn in 2 spots. It was far enough away for them to not agro on us or the speakers. 
---
We literally just stood there and did nothing the whole time and completed it. As we were leaving, we found 2 crowds of mobs standing in the parking lot and by the mountains.
---
That's a great idea, as you say it's already part of the system for events. Shouldn't be too hard to change things.
---
How is that not already a thing!
---
I have taked brakes several times, and get back motivated but in two weeks motivations goes away
---
Here is my tactic to counter griefing.
---
I change servers.
---
Problem solved.
---
In Rust if you get “grieved” you might just be DONE playing for that month. Hours upon hours of progress lost and there is no escaping the team that killed you.
---
Fallout griefers are pathetic and they would not last 5 seconds in Rust.
---
I recently got a Nintendo switch and I am addicted to donkey kong. Play 2 player with my wife and it's just this on going joke that "its on like donkey kong"! Don't buy one off Amazon right now, major inflation, call target daily they get them in multiple times a week and them them for retail at $300.
---
Those of us who aren't FO1st subscribers can't keep much around, it is too heavy for the standard stash. I convert my stable flux into easier to manage serums ASAP. I do sell off excess occasionally though for 100 caps when I'm feeling lazy but normally I stock serums.
---
Someone did this the other day and I had no idea what was going on, mass enemy spawn slaughterhouse.
---
I'm thinking of making the same thing. Although magazine covers are mostly awesome to look at, the budget impact is too much to keep it. Shame.
---
Wait, you can’t do the Raider dailies now?
---
I can do both Raiders and Settlers dailies still (but I did split the gold evenly between the two, so that could be why?)
---
Had this issue yesterday, and every couple weeks it seems
---
I was involved in one like this and it was great.  I assumed it was a bug in the event and not a exploit.  I'm actually glad to hear that it is repeatable because it might make the event enjoyable again.
---
I can sadly relate
---
I want to avoid having people spawn under my stairs. Do visitors spawn in a different location?
---
It appears they do, but still roughly NE.
---
I did just tear down most of my camp and rebuild it but I didn’t move the camp “box”.
---
It's not okay to post that, against rule 10. Head over to the trading sub, if you go to my post history you'll find it. We are not allowed to Sammy its name here
---
The quicker i do this event the quicker i can go do other things in this game i have 923 hours on.  
---
Okay guys. No putting down your PA in radiation rumble to make it block the enemies. And no shooting the ghouls in the legs with a shotgun and crippling them. Oh and no healing the NPCs. And while we're at it no collecting ore and holding it until you have 100 or there's 20 seconds to go. That makes it easier. You put that ore in as soon as you collect it. MAKE IT HARD FOR YOURSELF!
---
They did reduce weight by 90% at least... it makes sense though since they are objects that need to be rendered. That is why camp budgets exist, for stability.
---
k
---
😮
---
Eh trading posts are not allowed here, try the market sub (it's in my post history, cant name it here either).
---
Your camera is a great tool to find legendary body's
---
Yea there's 4 paints total for the power armor helmet. Theres the American flag one, American flag (no audio), stealth gray one and stealth gray ( no audio)
---
I got pretty tired of playing fallout as well even though I love the whole series, just picked up wasteland 2 though and absolutely loving it, feels like an older fallout game in a slightly modernized fashion (still a little dated since it was released in 2014) but it feels great to discover a different take on roughly the same concept.
---
I like 1H.
---
THe weapons are lighter and faster.   
---
While they do less damage per hit, they hit more often, so usually end up doing more damage in the same time frame.
---
For example, unaltered by foods, etc, my vampire switchblade is rated at 88 dmg.  My grognak is rated at 190.  THe switchblade hits 3x in the time it takes the grognak to hit once,
---
3x88=264.  1x190=190.
---
My FSS ghoul slayer switchblade is also rated at 88, but will hit 4-5x in the same time as the grognak takes to hit once.
---
And the switchblades weigh in at 0.36, compared to the grognak at 3.6.
---
Power attacks are a bit different - the switchblades top out about 500 dmg
---
For swords, the gutter - with a power attack, does a bit over 1k - takes out a L40 MM in one hit..and is still faster than the grognak.
---
Out of PA, the deathclaw gauntlet is a great choice.
---
combine a vampire weapon with healing factor mutation.... you are good to go :)
---
It’s called burnout. That’s why I don’t play just one game.
---
Last I checked the title of the post was not “Fallout isn’t a children’s game” or “Should my kid play fallout?” Or “RANT: The ESRB rating system is garbage” seems quite off topic
---
Yes to the scrap box questions. 
---
Very easy to transfer. Go to private with character A. Find a container that shows 0/0 in its weight numbers at the bottom (you don’t have to have 0/0 but it allows unlimited weight). I use the sack in the shopping cart near the new NPCs down the stairs at Vault 76. Transfer your stuff to the container. Log out and immediately (don’t mess around - you have a few minutes but near to stay focused) change to character B, private world, head to that same container and withdraw your items.
---
Ah, just did, sorry.
---
When I get bored I use my artillery to shake up bases but it does no damage so I figure it’s pretty harmless (still kind of a dick move).  Doing actual harm for funsies is extra dick.
---
As early as you feel all right about venturing into the Toxic Valley, I'd say.  The scout camp is close to Morgantown, so you're not even going all that deep into it.
---
A lot of the merit badge quests are things that you can just incidentally check off as you're doing other stuff.  Killing things, crafting things, taking pictures of things, hacking terminals, etc.  They'll each require at least a little bit of effort to complete, but there's no reason not to get started as soon as you can.
---
Why did you split the gold???
---
Until the radiation completely fades from the planet.
---
Liberty Prime skin P2W was pls remove
---
It could make friendly animals hostile, for example brahmin harder to milk as they run away from you.
---
That’s how the devs designed the game to be played, but he and his son can play it however they want to, what are you (or the devs) meant to say/do about it.
---
&gt;Take our fast travel. You god damned people don’t even want to really play Fallout. 
---
Oh shit, you mean this game isn’t the Half-Life 3? Well god damn, no wonder I’m spending so much money on it to do my part to help support future updates. 
---
Bud, I have zero idea what you’re crying about. I have 1st too, and I still play the game. Most of the time I’m *walking around* hunting things or trying to find somebody to help out in game. I have no idea what your last sentence is supposed to be about, but it sounds like you have enough salt in you to make Kilimanjaro jealous.
---
Thanks for the reply and the stats :)
---
I don't have shotgun perks so of course it does less damage.
---
What platform? Console or PC?
---
Maybe you’ll just have better luck during the upcoming Meat Week, whenever that ends up being.
---
Do you have display cases? If so, which are you using?
---
When you first logged on was your CAMP placed, or did you have move it?
---
Mole miners are a good source as tgey drop it.  there also is a place to drop an extractor between a Hornwright purifying site and the cabin where Encryptid takes place. 
---
Low level mole miners exist in the ash heap.
---
Console, Xbox 1 
---
I have regular display cases and weapon racks I hang above them
---
Too long
---
2-3 months of doing the dailies
---
PvP a buddy in water then revive
---
I’ve yet to interact with a player with X*anything*X in their name who wasn’t a little shit
---
There must be some who are stable personalities, but I haven’t run into one yet
---
Deathclaw hides though they are heavy
---
I quit. I woulda chugged some chems to get that dmg boost. Junkies ffr 90rw is a god roll. I had a junkies 1 star that I accidentally scripped, but it did CRAZY damage to the SBQ.
---
Thought maybe Paige would like me finally. Didn’t work.
---
No my camp was loaded in I didn’t have to server hop or anything. I do have display cases the taller ones with the wooden back and some weapon racks. One pistol,
---
One rifle, and a heavy
---
If you are on the Xbox I’d gladly donate a couple mothman wings.
---
Great. 😂OP Gauss Shotgun Build coming Fall of 2020.
---
What bug?
---
Keep your guns and bullets 5 for this event if there enough people playing it. I'll score 1,800-2,500 steal.
---
The Geoff Keighley interview? There's nothing in there about the capital wasteland. They mention fallout 3 with Geoff sorta asking about remasters and Todd says it's playable at 4k on Xbox. And then the reveal showcase also nothing about the capital wasteland
---
The order of how good a biuld is, is purely opinion when I started ( over a year ago) I hated bloodied biulds even if the damage was way higher same with junkies but as I played and evolved with the game now I love my bloodied cammando.  
---
To add to this some people may think junkies is number one cuz they prefer full health.  
---
 2 shot and anti armor do have down sides 2 shot theres a chance only one projectile will hit which makes less damage then a regular non legendary and anti armor has armor ignore but no added damage buffs those sound like downsides to me
---
Good thing I don't judge a post by it's title. However after choosing to read the post I naturally came to that question and subsequently those questions. I apologize.
---
Where your vendors behind a locked door and hidden? People can still buy form them if they are unplugged
---
Are you doing the camp budget glitch?
---
After a year on this sub it’s clear there’s a cadre of people who think the US should be the only nation / region celebrated in game. 
---
I’m not saying BGS should honor every countries national holidays - but it takes 6 minutes to make a flag retexture with CC0 assets (flag designs). 
---
A designer worth their salt would setup a photoshop action and let the PS do the hard work for all the active player nations while they drink a coffee.
---
No clue, the raider stuff doesn't like to show up for me, even if I go and talk to the npcs
---
Yeah they’re behind a locked door but that’s the thing, the items they bought aren’t ones I had in The machines they were in my personal stash.
---
lol, trap bases in Fallout 76
---
*Laughs in Rust*
---
It won't take that long lol. You can gain extra rep by turning Davenport's pictures in to Ward, and you can send the former raider to Foundation. You can also farm rep by running a loop of random encounters. I split the gold like you and managed to max out Settler rep in about two weeks without playing every single day.
---
That would be great if I still had any buddies
---
I think they can, but they dont show up on the map as a vendor
---
Na dude this is awsome I have a almost full set of ss vanguards with vampires gauntlet and my health literally never moves below 90 percent
---
Not at all, I don’t know how to tbh. I know people have but I built everything I wanted without reaching the budget
---

---
Will take about a month
---
It’s funny because some crossbows say they do have a scope on them (but it’s a lie they really don’t)
---
Also can we get F in the chat for Bow accuracy in general
---
I've been going for a 2x2 or even 2x1 build with two stories, stairs on the outside like a fire escape with my generator underneath. Gives me space for crafting stuff below and living area with bed above.
---
It’s so bad though
---
I might be wrong but it seems to me that in the beginning of last year it did do that
---
It looks like mud
---
FYI.. although not likely, server crashes will cause loss of items.  Use a friend to transfer legacy or God rolls if possible.
---
I will investigate this. That audio is annoying af.
---
Oof
---
That's generous!
---
How could I prove my stuff is missing dude it’s gone
---
Great - for the rest of us who kept the engine running and fuel in the tank during the wasteland of delays for that release the air is getting hella stale getting the same photomode frames
---
Maybe they left it out on purpose because the settlement is under attack notifications in FO4 got annoying quickly?
---
They should have the notifications but with the ability to turn them off in the menu
---
There's a terminal in the generator room in the university.
---
I'm sick of trap bases, especially ones where they just drop spike traps on you. Even if it isn't a trap base and you're just hanging out at your base I won't even bother checking vendors anymore cause I don't want to bother with getting killed while trying to shop. It's just annoying more than anything.
---
Yea haha. I placed my camp at a random spot, just because I had a small river going down the hill + what for me was important no enemie spawn around my camp radius.
---
Had a guy in the lower 100 levels how was at my camp and he was always making the angry emote and thumbs down infront of my vendors and also around the hole camp.
---
After a few mins he ran down the hill.... And came 1 min later back with a lvl 95 glowing Behemoth lol. Tbh I don't even noticed that my camp was near the Behemoth spawn at two lakes. I put my mic on and was saying 'come on man what's wrong with you' and one punched the Behemoth into pieces. No respond from his side. Only the angry emote again and then he left my camp lol.
---
I try to be diplomatic
---
Dude, this right here is a huge reason I got myself an Oculus Quest. I realized sitting down and playing games made me super bored after weeks and weeks of gaming non-stop. 
---
  
---
VR puzzle games and Beat Saber have gotten be back into gaming because now I have variety in my game library. If you can find one I totally suggest picking one up. Well worth the investment.
---
Use a courier to transfer anything of high value. While rare I know a few people that have lost items to their private server crashing.
---
Unless you mean the BOS password which is on the 4th floor in Fort Defiance.
---
AngryTurtle has a vid out on magic shotguns.  Check it out.
---
On fallout 4 theres a mod that have scopes for Crossbows and they look so cool,im sure adding that to 76 won't brake the game
---
Yes! That’s why I picked up a Quest last Christmas. :D
---
worthless in the meta-game trading sense, but still super useful in game for things exactly like this or serum plans or what have you. Good luck!
---
Years. For me anyway, I keep doing other stuff.
---
Hmmm. How about merging glitch?  I've accidentally done the budget glitch. I had perk cards on to reduce stash. I somehow swapped cards whilst I was mending some armor, and my stash went over 800. Which then allows players to access stash through vendors.
---
So far it's Bloodied, bashing damage, and reduced weight.
---
Yeah point blank shots going to nowhere....ugh
---
Hunting rifle and then a combat rifle, I'd say. If you're PC and 20 or higher I'd be glad to make you a Fixer.
---
Roll one with +1 perception and it will almost never miss in VATS. My gauss and my instigating pump both have +1 perception, and they're VATS killing machines.
---
Sounds fishy
---
I’m just going to wait I guess. There doesn’t seem to be a fix
---
I was able to buy gold every week on reset day, however this week I was a little short on caps so I missed the day. Tried to buy gold yesterday and he just says to come back next week.
---
Man switches are a pain to get still? I remember during the quarantine it was literally impossible. They sold like 10 mins after being stocked. Glad i bought mine WAY before it started. Im late to the party but if i get burnt out of my usual game genre i play animal crossing or my saving grace, Breath of the wild. Games so nice.
---
I just like your name.
---
RED CHINESE COMMUNIST DETECTED
---
Downloaded and installed New California (along with a bunch of QoL mods and texture packs) and I've gotta say, besides some mediocre voice acting, it's a lot of fun, and really feels like the creators made a real labour of love.
---
If you've got a pc check it out it!
---
Maybe? Idk honestly but I’m just gonna delete my machines tbh. People aren’t honest they do not deserve my stuff. Just gonna lock all my purifiers too. It’s a shame I love just giving people stuff too bc I have a lot it’s just I’m not gonna get taken advantage of like that
---
And where's the BOS Password in Fort Defiance exactly?
---
Junkies aiming
---
I'd take the arrow to the knee loop any time of day over that annoying, nonsensical creature. Add the most boring fetch questline to her personality and you just wish you hadn't just left her to die in that bunker.
---
I had a Junkies aim damage 250dr. I ran it primed for about 8k rounds and then got 40 scrip out of it. The damage is decent but the ammo is too heavy and expensive to do the same damage as a primed 50cal in my opinion.
---
Anti material rifle because we need more variety for sniper guys.
---
I just want my junk jet man, maybe also Euclid C Finder just for the lols, it would prolly suck hard like all the other "explosive" weps.
---
That's my only fix, time
---
AMR fron NV and the CC carbine from 4
---
Wait...you can be so stealthy that your notifications can't even find you?
---
applying The Stanley skin to a Grognaks Axe changes it to an unarmed weapon animation, changes the weapon's statistics, and worst of all, cannot be removed. Thanks again. heres a (obnoxious) video about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTelyGTLRPQ
---
Whatever you do, don't check their post history. You have been warned.
---
I hear that. If I lose my bloodied gauss I think I'd cry.
---
Top floor, in the BOS corner room with all the computers/power armor frames
---
And do not enter normal world by mistake either as it will reset your private world!
---
I tweaked my Fallout76prefs.ini after finding a suggestion on Nexus. It's a nice white that isn't super harsh, but I think just setting each one at 1 would be a bright white if that's what you're after.

No more Fasnacht stuff!!!, i swear if i see one more vendor selling 100 armor and all of them are fasnacht stuff im gonna rage quit!!!.
---
Good plan, although I tend to keep for treasure map runs. We've bagged 18,000 steel between a team of 4 when turning in large numbers of maps and scrapping the kit obtained with G&amp;B 5!
---
The best purpose for that ax I have heard about. Great job!
---
Of course Euclid's C-Finder
---
Oxhorn is prolific but not great for accurate lore, he draws stranger connections than a schizophrenic and he accidentally inserts his mods into the lore because he forgets what's installed or vanilla. Personally I can't take his overwrought-but-still-reading-a-script style, but that's just me.
---
Oh jesus christ. Pffft nothing interesting... Bam 3 posts of his Wang.
---
I hate myself.
---
Yeah cause normally its hard.... you really need to cheese every single thing in this game
---
this post ramps up its anger as you get further in, in a good way. i felt the same way about my gauss pistol. bloodied, etc, should kick major ass and then totally blows most of the time. im grinding for the shotty on my alt and was hoping it would be different and you burst my bubble big time. life isnt all flinging fasnacht frogs 100yd in the air anymore :(

They should really remaster and remake fo1 2 3 for morons like me that missed them I wish I could play them so dn much
---
I have 50 odd treasure (non-forset)maps I have only looked for one in my 300 levels. Are they worth it? What can you find.
---
You want to use this scrouring brush on your eye's too?
---
You can play fo3 and new vegas on console
---
The ones they took had very good rolls but they weren’t ones that I was super worried about loosing. The most valuable stuff I keep on my character at all times. It’s just really annoying because I planned on selling them after I offloaded my caps on stuff like bullion, ammo, and other legendaries people are trying to get rid of. I’ve been trying to find a legacy flamethrower or a bloodied lmg for so long now
---
I'm tempted to just kill a cricket and submerge my eyes in its acid.
---
Sure you can but won't your eyes start bleeding after 10 min with a ps4pro?
---
The real scary option...
---
I'm not the only one those bots drive insane. Feels like an intern wrote some of those lines.
---
The only one I haven't found annoying so far is the original one and the communist
---
Prolly 😂😢
---
Oh yeah those would be fun how did I forget about those!
---
Yeah I get you man. I carry all my bloodied guns. As I switch game tactics alot.
---
But shit man. I've got 2 sets of Unyielding and 1 vanguard that's worth a pretty penny stashed away :S
---
I’m ok with this. 
---
Also visible mutations would be great. We would all look like lizard people.
---
That's a cool idea, I'm thinking of doing the challenges now that I have nothing else to do..
---
I'm assuming you have to be in a highly dangerous area for that to happen. In Flatwoods after a week the mongrels only broke one of my barricades covering my generator. The only time I've had serious damage was when some players destroyed it and they actively came looking for me. I think they did it, too because they were wanted. I received no notification.
---
If you ever need to hang a hat somewhere...
---
give a stimpak to a noob; in some small way, you've made someone else's day just a little brighter.
---
stay frosty, amigo.
---
When you finish the main quest line it will walk you thru where to find the plans to buy with  the gold.
---
Damn yeah honestly I’m kinda worried about how I’ll handle it in the future because eventually I’m gonna run out of carry weight and I’ll have to use the stash box even with the perk cards I use plus then what happens when there’s no space in the box. Managing equipment is a boss fight of its own
---
Of course, the simplest answer is the correct one. It works now after uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers. Thank you. I feel dumb now.
---
The mothman and the Flatwoods monster can spawn at your camp - I’ve had that happen plenty of times since beta. Though perhaps having turrets does something to help, because I’ve only had either show up when I had turrets, I believe.
---
I don’t know why, but my camp seems to attract mothmen like flies.
---
so if I keep the gold I will be able to buy those plans he is offering?
---
The stealth suit doesnt completely negate rad damage it just takes it down to 1 per second, right? I cant fast travel if im taking 1 rad per second so eventually I would die if I cant run away from it. Also arent there Tesla arc traps? The easiest solution would be to just dump your junk before camp traveling then if you go to a camp that you die from, and are annoyed by it, just block the person. Thats much quicker and more efficient than alt+f4 or using perks and/or mods for an already rare scenario. I have combined 500 levels across my characters, been playing since Beta and have maybe ran across 3 trap camps. Are trap camps a mostly console thing? The most annoying camp I encountered was at the SBQ. Dude had a blueprinted camp he put down that had like 100 of those siren towers that were all powered. Heard that shit the whole fight.
---
I sent a video and a ticket to them about this, they said they will try to fix it and gave me a refund.
---
Also, the chest also talks, so, even if you have tge silenced helmet, the armor keeps talking.
---
What's the point of the exterminator perk if all mirelurk and bugs are animals,covered by the hunter perk?
---
None.
---
Get yourself a mule my dude. Took me 2 mins to get out the vault. Get a friend to carry your shit over.
---
I was always at my limit. Then I made a mule, transfered all my flux. Down to 550 on stash now.
---
That's exactly what it was. Thank you.
---
Best to have a courier or a friend playing with you. I did this on my old machine while my main rig was apart and being water cooled and I had multiple blue screens and obviously didn't make the cutoff for getting back on the server and lost some cool stuff. But it did help me thin out my inventory... :)
---
Dividing up the gold will get you rep and won't shut you out of any plans. After you complete the WL quests there'll be gold bullion vendors at Foundation, Crater and the Secret Service that will sell you the plans. You'll need max rep with Foundation and Crater before you have access to everything though.
---
They probably have concerns about bows being “too” accurate. 
---
Which would be a huge lol
---
I said it a few times before I was banned from the official Forums and I've said it here, I would like to see a quest line that takes us into Ohio and to Wright Patterson AFB, home of the infamous Hangar 18.
---
For those who don't know, Hangar 18 is purported to house the crash from Roswell, New Mexico.
---
It would be really interesting to tie the Flatwood's Monster, which is a Zetan, to Hangar 18.
---
I'll never agree with the decision to remove head equipment stats.  Just like I'll never agree with the decision to basically completely remove single-slot outfits that occupy all armor slots but grant additional stats + energy and ballistic defense in one package.  AKA how armor used to be pre-Fallout 4.  There's only like 1 or 2 now if I'm not mistaken.
---
It was already at a minimum in Fallout 4 and one of the few unique, useful outfits I can recall was the Mechanist's costume.  Now we just have cosmetic clothing, which is dumb, because previously even casual clothes and accessories gave unique things like charisma, or intelligence boosts, and I see no reason why it had to be removed, since Bethesda probably could have easily offered an option to make any outfit cosmetic without needing to remove armor beneath it.
---
# Translate the guidestones.
---
Funny thing is I'm not even using speakers: just my Arctis 7 headset. The issue has been solved, though. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
I personally thought they would update it with wastelanders to affect human NPCs and other players
---
That event was unfortunately rare and didn't have a guaranteed legendary enemy on it.
---
Just damn. That sucks now you have to work that much more for gold that was free.
---
Pickman's Blade from fo4
---
I figured out the problem was with my drivers thanks to other comments. Thanks for the interesting suggestion, though. I'll keep it in mind if I ever have sound problems again.
---
I just really appreciate how detailed he gets and how he finds the parallels between the games. I didn't know that he forgets and adds his personal mods into the lore. I don't watch him on a regular basis only if he comes up when I'm looking up something else.
---
You're welcome to come by my camp if you want to see proper trap setups.
---
I haven't seen 1 person wearing that since they "balanced it"
---
oh then I will keep the gold, the rep farm is easy and fun
---
I wonder if Bethesda changed something. I never picked up the key, but can enter from the exit without issue.
---
Same with lvls, a way to uppgrade the lvls for script or legendary modules to max lvl
---
I find those CAMPS fun. I drop my tent and junk and change a perk or two. Head and try my luck. In normally disappointed when I get through it, and their best effort is to remove the camp so I fall. And that doesn't work because of -50 fall DMG x2. I agree if that's all you got you step up your game.
---
Someone wanna just end me while were at it?
---
I put in a ticket and this is what I got back. Maybe they mean the next update on the 30th. (fingers crossed)

Maps provide a small number of caps, some aid, plans and (non legendary) weapons and armor. In small numbers no big deal but once you save up stacks of them (50+) for each dig location it is a great way to top up. Last run we did I ended up with 300+ psychobuff/tats as well as thousands of units of steel and several hundred plans. The variety of weapons and armor pieces also are very useful for scrapping to unlock mods for them. Definitely one of my best sources of mods and rare plans.
---
Good point. Theres a lot of effects that are useless. I didn’t even know PvP damage was capped at 110 because I don’t do a lot of PvP. But I wanted to try out my Assassins Fixer the other night and was highly disappointed when I found out that damage is capped at 110. I thought maybe the game was bugged or something so I tried my bloodied explosive black powder rifle and it also did 110. Then I realized why PvP is such a joke.
---
Seriously this game does not need tricks to make things quick and easy....
---
Are you on now? I've got spare bloodied versions of most heavies to get you started
---
Yea that’s about the only thing I’ve found
---
Oof dude, junkies bonus damage even if you don’t have any buffs due to a but
---
Maybe on other platforms but PS4 doesn’t have a lot of duped weapons. Legacy energy weapons were not created due to duping. They may have been legacied because of it.
---
Gauss rifle from Fallout 2. A real Gauss weapon you can stand behind, because you sure wouldn’t want to stand in front of it.
---
I got some for sale
---
This filled my soul, thanks buddy
---
Wait there are set bonuses? Since when?
---
I'm on PC. I've got 600 levels and 2500 hours and I've seen maybe 5 trap camps. They're not super common, no. For the rads, it takes it to &lt;1 per second. The emitters don't constantly emit, they'd have to be reset. Obviously if you store your junk there's no "risk," but some people prefer to thwart the traps. I've never seen Tesla  traps used in a lethal capacity. I dont think Teslas or flame traps can go on long enough to be lethal unless you're really low hp and super slow on the stim draw
---
Interesting, thank you for the response. Just to be clear, if I have duplicates of the same map I just keep digging it up?
---
Oh lol. Ever heard of magic guns? For shotguns, they are bugged in vats if they have 33% vats or 50 limb damage. There are a few more that I am missing which someone will probably stays in the near future.
---
says you
---
I can confirm it does....one shotting most enemies in vats without any shotgun cards...

I need to repair my catapult when I come back,but I don't mind.
---
Yes, they give loot from each one, also recommend being on a team as your teammates also get aid and caps when you dig up a map, bit they have to be in close proximity. If a group of you are all digging at the same time it sigifi increases your rewards.

Todd WAS talking out of his ass then and literally every other time. Todd ALWAYS talks out of his ass these days.
---
“Douche canoe” haha
---
Fr. Everyone has em rn so why sell em?
---
I just turn on pacifist so no one can ruin my day
---
Agreed. Bow builds are already mildly unpleasant as is because bows have only a single arrow in their clip, and thus can’t handle the hordes the game loves to throw at us. Anything to improve the range can only help.
---
Though a crossbow with a larger clip would be excellent...
---
I made the silent helmet but it still talks
---
Yes, you will.
---
I could definitely see myself stuck in this cycle.
---
It's currently FO76, RDR2 and Mudrunner.
---
I liked the bozar from fo2.
---
Ummmm ya the bug is even with pacifist on them hitting you procs the damage proc mutations and starts PvP VS them... That's the bug and why greifers running around whacking people. Only solution is not to have the mutations
---
There is an Angry Turtle video where he talks about bugged shotgun effects that make them over perform, I.e. 33% vats, limb damage and bash damage. For now they do way more damage than they should.
---
30% Armor ignore, limb damage, 15% rate of fire so far
---
Rolling every day for 2 types: Instigating or Bloodied with 3 stars, to decide on my final build.
---
here's some more reports https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=the+stanley&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all
---
Yeah I noticed that too...
---
This is probably going to be very common with the current global situation.
---
I have PS now and see a bunch of games I'd like to try but that depression hits and nothing seems fun.
---
 Or you know maybe they're max caps and don't want to lose any extra?
---
Checking the map might be the exact reason why they logged on you.
---
Damn that’s annoying. Luckily I’m a decent build, but that’s just annoying
---
Love me some nukashine !
---
Elijah’s LAER from NV:Old world blues.
---
Did you put the stolen weapons on display at any point, even just to see what they look like? I just had a player be able to purchase something I took off display.
---
There is also a rumored bug that depends on your camp being slow to load (over budget/many decorations+laggy server) and your vending machines being quickly accessible near ground level.
---
Yeah I'd like something new, but what about a spin once a week prize wheel? So you get a chance of getting something super cool, or repair kits, free atoms etc??
---
All the comments here talking about other games...
---
Go for a run, read a book, learn something new. Don't get me wrong, I've been logged in for 3-4  hours a night for almost 3 months as I worked through the stories and exploring... but once it gets boring and the content runs out, just do something not gaming related.
---
Sorry for sounding like all the young players moms.
---
The damage cap is 190 now but assassins has always been useless.
---
Red Glare and SMMG, because they look super badass.
---
Scorchbeast or if your camp is at white springs then the robots
---
Another alternative is getting your hands on some radscorpion eggs and making omelets out of them. They have the same effect. One type of omelet cures all addictions, and the other one random.
---
New player here - not digging PVP.
---
Yesterday in-game had first PVP experience - took over workshop, someone with seemingly infinite range flamer killed me.  That's cool, I came back, died, rinse and repeat...slowling getting hang of it when a friend told me I lose 50 caps each death?  I checked caps and appeared he was right...screw that...no more in-game PVP for me, will take workshops on private servers.
---
Today I figured out how to disable mods and tried NW.  I was clueless and without chat couldn't ask questions.  With no idea what to do, I died pretty quickly.  My first impressions were not exciting enough to bring me back to play multiple games till I learn the ropes or even watch youtube videos to get up to speed.  Only way I would go back is with experienced NWer on Discord to help me out.  Dude's comments about multiple exploits in PVP makes me even less inclined to try it.
---
Anyways, that sums up my newcomer PVP experience...tried it...no thanks...back to PVE grinding for me.
---
Been disconecting a lot since the weekend when bethesda crashed, cant be helped.
---
That's a God dammm magic damm God roll
---
Mysterious Magnum for the sweet sound everytime I take it out
---
I get your point brother, and is right 🦾
---
Grow up will you
---
Or maybe the game just crashed on them.
---
Hey man if that's your playstyle go for it. I'm not too fussed freeing up a lil bit of my stash clicking on repair all. Traps naturally destroy themselves when triggered anyhow.
---
T45 or t60 would be most appropriate.
---
It works if they're AFK or using the high capacity backpack and not aware of what's happening. Otherwise it takes so long they can easily just move or take radaway. I tested this with my alt account, it's pretty much just for trolling or maybe really low level bloodied players.
---
I just wish theyde bring back incinerators, it could easily just be a mod for the flamer (ik it was a creation club thing in 4, I hate that they paywalled that)
---
Or all the different carbines. Or the anti material rifle (make it a heavy weapon though, that’d be cool.)
---
Probably, why?
---
Deliverer from FO4.
---
Not entirely a weapon but I’d like 308 receivers for the AR like on FO4. The carbine rilfe from new Vegas was pretty cool.
---
Who else would it be??
---
In Fallout 3 it was the T45 model that was used. So that would be the type to use to recreate it.
---
I must not get around enough because I don't see these trap bases.
---
It seems like other players are wary of it tho because almost no one steps foot in my build and I have the spawn point strategically set up at the bottom of a cliff. Yet, people still decide to try and hop there way around instead if just taking the stairs. 
---
I'm not a trap camper. I just really like to build!
---
They stack, but sleek doesnt stack with speed demon so if you're running that mutation then theyre useless. I recommend either custom fitted or cushioned for legs.
---
{heart, thumbs up, heart, mothman dance}
---
I think i remember that too, early on we had fast travel mats too
---
Orbital strike beacon is basically the same thing. And it does suck sadly haha
---
Goddamn, that's a clever use of mechanics, right there.
---
Hope Chally gets more greens, hmmm
---
My fourth try got me a B/25/25. Sure, I'd rather have reduced weight but I'm damn pleased with this one.
---
From Fallout 3 The Drone canon Ex-b, heavy Incinerator, or the tesla canon.... make heavy great again
---
Oh also the dart gun and deliverer because pistols are so far behind
---
True that! :D junk jet it is then.
---
It's not quite twelve inches, but it smells like a foot!
---
One of the dailies is at Dolly Sods in the Mire, which is frequently guarded by a high level Yao Guai, but everything else should be doable by level 25 or so.
---
There will be no Legion the next 150 years or so. It's there just to tickle your nostalgia.
---
The pvp in 76 is even stranger than the headless chicken run pvp in the division.
---
Always someone hanging dong
---
Still some people within the roleplay community want to create the Appalachian legion, still it’s nice either way
---
Yep. I’ve played so much fallout over the years, thousands of hours since ‘98, I got burnt out and hated the feeling of being uninterested in my favorite game universe. Even when 76 came out I was like bleh but I think most people were anyway. Up until wastelanders I hadn’t played any fallout since the 76 release. And now since May ive logged somewhere around 300 hours on fallout 76 lol oh yeah I still love my fallout I just needed a break I guess. Feel like my old self again and I’m even motivated to do a true survival run on fallout 4(i played around a bit but never got more than 20 hours on survival) So yeah, sometimes you just need some time away from the wasteland, and video games in general.
---
Yeah, that was fixed either with, or a few patches before Wastelanders dropped, but it's been my go-to receiver ever since it was, unless I'm short on mats, then hardened it is.
---
It did come out shortly after Fallout 1st, so probably. Just ditch that ugly helmet though. Get a red bandana, aviator or fashionable glasses, and the sheepsquatch imposter headdress, and you’re good to go.
---
When you shoot a gauss weapon in VATS now, it's max damage (as if charged). With the fix, you will only do full damage in VATS if you charge fully each shot. Which is intended.
---
However, they are not fixing the constant missing bug, which makes every gauss gun very very very annoying to use. With patch 20 you will miss just as bad, but this time you won't know until you waste time charging each shot and missing...  😑 Yeah... No.
---
it used to work fine, it only got borked with update 19
---
It may be that because my camp does lag and often takes a minute to load in
---
WHAAAATTT??!!!?? Bethesdacrap has a game that crashes?  WHAAAATTTTtt??? Never I say.
---
At least we see the same point
---
I put down 76 after the vending machines were broken for weeks. Started playing ESO, stopped playing ESO... I think I am just out of phase with gaming right now, I'm starting to pick up my old routine again (recording/producing music) that I had before I sunk into the quarantine gaming pit which is really really nice.
---
EDIT: Every now and then I get an urge to play New Vegas tho, been playing that game for years and have never gotten to the ending. I'm currently on one of my best/longest play-through's. Usually I restart because I have forgotten what I was doing and want the story fresh in my head when I get to the dam, I prevent myself from watching all endgame videos as well because I don't want to spoil that shit.
---
Instigating, Junkies, Bashing. ;)
---
The most annoying ally, even worse than the Wanderer with her stupid guitar. I've found out that old man from Foundation is the best ally, almost not annoying at all.
---
I guess so. Beware the mighty legion of 4 people :D
---
I think it would be great if the game notified you when someone fast travels to your camp, that would help :)
---
Since they don't know HOW to fix their game, they consider it a feature that works.  So you are out of luck.
---
In though the nose, out through the mouth
---
I'm a bloodied gauss user and I used to use the quad one a lot to save up cnd for bloodied one. It is still very powerful, while with adrenal and other perks, it could kill sbs from the sky if you aim right within 1-4 shots depending on range. However, if you get a qffr one, you can basically use it as an automatic gun in vats and spam crazy with the trigger or button, I took out the queen myself with one in 4 min and 30 seconds (I've got vid proof).
---
Either the AMR or the laser musket if it didn’t require ammo and instead used only the crank.
---
Scrip...
---
I don’t see a problem with that. Ave
---
YouTube Angry Turtle *Magic Weapons*. Or, you know, search this sub.
---
True, I never thought about that. Unfortunately they will probably go in another direction and just prevent us from dropping a tent in the area rather than being able to fix spawn points.
---
PA is an exception because if it didn’t apply damage resist, it wouldn’t make sense because it’s part of the giant metal suit of armor.
---
The helmets, however? So the slots can be kept cosmetic. I wouldn’t want to have my scientist wear a helmet all the time to maximize my armor while sacrificing my look.
---
Of course, they could just add an option to toggle it, but frankly, this solution means one less slot to grind legendary effects for.
---
Looks pretty similar to my build. As far as I know it's the lifegiver perk making us so tanky.  It was discovered a few months back that something about the perk bugs out and causes your health to regenerate after getting hit.  I'm in the same boat, pretty much survive anything as long as it isn't mirelurk poison damage or an excessively hard sneak hit.  As far as I know the bug still exists because I am just as tanky now as I was when it was first discovered.
---
As with most things 76 there is an Angry turtle video on how it works.
---
Edit: i skipped the one sentence where you said you watched an Angry turtle video.   It's probably the one on this very topic lol.  I dumb.
---
A few days back, I found one dead scorchedbeast laying across my camp and another body not far off. I'm not sure how my base survived tbh.
---
That would be nice. I always check the map before I log out. But as people say there is a lot of disconnects and stuff
---
 But there is no place to enter either password. There is also no password entry on the German in the basemant.
---
MEAT WEEK! MEAT WEEK!
---
I've had numerous encounters with the yoa guai at my camp. It seems like they just spawn right in front of my camp. lol
---
Honestly the gold is easier to farm than the rep. And by the time you get the rep unlocked for the good stuff, you will have plenty of gold. Unless you just have no interest in the Raider/Settler plans.
---
This. I spent ages hunting for a full Vanguard BOS Combat set and it turns out one piece is light and the rest is sturdy. So annoying
---
That happens a lot unfortunately :(
---
Okay thanks wasn't sure that's all with it saying repair "T-45d power armor and variants T-51b power armor"
---
Omg! You expect Fallout 76 to be like Fallout 4. where you can control most types of legendaries you get by using a glitch. That is hilarious and stupid at the same time. I like the randomness of what you get because it makes the game more interesting. Second of all about all of your inquiries about the DLCs to the capital and etc. Yes that was at E3 at the beginning of Fallout 76. But you've got to remember between the steam lawsuits, all the returns from not only the US but from other countries as well. The constant hacking in crashing of the game from dupers And pvp players recently over this update 20. This is bringing Bethesda to the brink of bankruptcy. If all of this did not happen then you would have gotten what you wanted. So you have no one to blame but the players themselves
---
Exactly, functional wins over cosmetic every time (for majority)....every...time (for majority)
---
That might be the best and most logical reason why that doesn’t happen. I never thought about that issue playing a role in not allowing cross platform.
---
I see you have serendipity on your build. Is this supposed to be bloodied?
---
 Okay thanks wasn't sure that's all with it saying repair "T-45d power armor and variants T-51b power armor"
---
I mean I did state my opinion that damage output is trumps.  And in that context, it's really hard to deny that bloodied has ruled the roost for a long time.
---
And frankly, framing it like "the downside of these guns is that their upsides are *potentially* *on occasion* less good" is kinda odd tbh.
---
For newbies at least, of course one you HAVE a excavator suit, it's basically trash, not even worth the acid to refine it.
---
The 50 cal reciever isn't unlocked by Defaut.  
---
You need Gunsmith level 3 and the appropriate recipe. I looked it up early this morning. It increases DPS for the standard Hardened receiver to at least 89 or higher.
---
I bought a exterminators  gatling laser for 6k one day only because it had reduced weight..that dam thing is still sitting in my stash box it's ok but dont justifying using it
---
The game isn't made for PvP. Especially with the damage cap. Move on. The term PvP build shouldn't even exist in a game like this. Anyone can make one too and deep throat a bunch of colas. 0 challenge.
---
No but i have the first level of it (through a pack) and it’s saved me a bunch against larger groups of enemies, would you suggest I remove that?
---
bow/crossbow builds are garbage. even with 95 acc. i miss 3/4 of the time. and with the drop rate of a bolt or arrow in this game your only shooting max 40 yards and hitting anything. a scope won't help youaim for their neck and hope it hits them stupid vats always missing
---
Does it have the legendary star extra limb damage? If so that’s a glitch with it, enjoy!
---
So if you place the tent next to where they spawn normally, they'll all just spawn in the courtyard? I've never seen this done. I have to be honest, that sounds really fun, like fish in a barrel fun.
---
I already got the Refined 50 cal one two days ago but don't have the Perk or mats yet the fire rate is.
---
Yeah, but aesthetically t51 looks way different. It's got rounded shoulders and the limbs are more cylindrical.
---
Sounds like that would help. Any suggestings on a 20-30 character and legendary hunting spots?
---
Gun fu, concentrated fire, grim reaper's sprint. You can pretty much sit on top the pole at the wall and endlessly vats snipe every scorched that comes in.
---
8 is what I have.  Please post if you find more.
---
3 hybrids not approved by robco, eyebot, sentry, protectron, mr handy and... I think a gutsy.  I forget the 8th one I have on display.
---
Did you find an assaultron?  Maybe that’s the 8th..
---
How do you even delete an item? I tried to delete Beckett's bar before and it kept telling me I couldn't because it was in use.
---
Certain effects are having weird interaction with secondary effects causing huge spikes in damage. Angryturtle has covered magical heavy guns a few times over the past few months.
---
Could be several effects causing the *magic*. ;)
---
World series baseball bat from 4. Never gets old.
---
Yeah, honestly you dont need any of the +DR/ER perks either. Once you get max level armor, your defense will be right around the "optimal" level to the point where you wont really notice a difference with those perks. Whereas % damage reduction like Lone Wanderer becomes much more valuable.
---
As someone that’s played this game from  the start I actually enjoy the creativity of the trap bases/camps.  
---
Junk is so easily obtained and there’s really no penalty for dying so the more the merrier.   The best are the subtle or not so subtle neon messages including one I just saw that stated “come on in the water is fine” and upon entering the camp the false floor gave way and you fell into water with punjis everywhere.  Bravo!
---
Ohh, I had way too much fun with one of these. 
---
Basically the owner was hidden a small area, blocked by the wall of punjis. So, I throw on light footed to go take a look.
---
Decide I'm gonna be an asshole and destroy their punjis/camp with explosive bait.
---
What I didn't intend to do was kill the owner with said bait. Said owner who had apparently been grabbing dropped junk but not stashing it. 
---
I couldn't stop laughing at that shit.
---
yes you are asking but . you assume everyone will be honest and nice and stay PG 13.... buthte world isnt nice and 3/4 of people will create content unsuitable for the game. thus why they will not allow it. they cannot police every photo on every system in the world. and we still dont want to see your loading screens. or apoc porn wierdo
---
It indeed did give a quick "blink and you miss it" notification.
---
The fido gun from new Vegas dlc
---
PvP almost killed the game a while back lol
---
Your build sounds awesome. But I'm lvl 120 and so far I haven't bothered with a bloody build. I've just centered most of my perk cards towards PA And heavy guns. Are there any good builds that don't involve bloodied?
---
No see anyone born after 1989 won't be able to comprehend this brand of fucking logic. 
---
Oooh I cursed, Reddit, sorry. This site is starting to resemble daycare.
---
I kept the gold it was the one chance at a nice haul.
---
I think I'll go with the T-45d for the build
---
It is indeed. I'm still rolling for a BFFRRW but I'm very content with my current one.
---
There's just t45 and t60 in fo76. The t60 looks basically the same it just has better stats.
---
Are they really considered animals? The Animal Friend perk doesn't work on them, to tame or pacify a mirelurk you need Wasteland Whisperer which effects creatures instead of animals. Seems like a mistake if so.
---
I would swap out ricochet for something else like fireproof or dodgy but otherwise looks good.
---
I did notice I caught a few downvotes LOL I mean, folks can get mad if they like but Beth has made it pretty clear what their priorities are with this game. Player agency is not one of them.
---
But I does not matter anyway. Most of the stuff in vendors is crap
---
Great! Thanks for the help, this gives me some ideas of how I can further make my build more flexible if I remove some of the dr/er perks as well
---
You need to wait for him to step away. Put a chair next to him and he might be inclined to sit on it at some point
---
Most of it is, but a few days ago i saw a 3* bloodied handmade, the camp disappeared just before I could read what the 3 stars were! Meh, it happens... :)
---
I don't assume anything, I'm simply saying it would be nice if it could be implemented with these exploits controlled. I don't want to post porn. I don't care if you don't want to see it or anybody else for that matter, but it would be a nice feature if it could be implemented without those concerns.
---
It's simply a suggestion, a man can dream, I'm not pushing anything here.
---
Fallout 76 is not a game for a 9 year old.  Enemies can be bloodied, dismembered, decapitated, and their heads or bodies explode in a gory mess depending on the weapon that is used.  Drug use and addiction is taken lightly.    
---
There is a reason the game is rated M.  You can defend yourself and minimize it all you want.  You're making bad parenting choices.
---
I believe you get addictol for completing the guided meditation event
---
Service Rifle. Although it looks like we are getting some actual skins for the Handmade that makes it look kinda close so I guess that works too
---
I'd bring a power fist to a gun fight any day of the week. The damage cap doesn't allow for it anymore though.
---
Didn't think of that.  Good to know - thanks!
---
Ugh that’s the worst dude I feel you. I play guitar, was overly obsessed at one point, and it’s the worst feeling ever when you just have no enjoyment playing anymore sometimes for months. Usually I’ll take a week break and then feel motivated again and shred faces, but my “breaks” have been getting longer and longer over the years. I think I’ve picked up my guitar one time since I’ve been quarantined for two months:( part of that is because of this game though lmfao been playing way too much 76 lately
---
95% to hit in vats on stationary target... arrows keep flying off randomly
---
I can't say that exist a "Garbage build" in this game,my instigating crossbow hit almost 3k per bolt,yes the acc is lame (Still not sure if is a bug or no) but im asking for a Scope not because will fix the acc issue but help ME aim cause the ironsights cover almost the entire screen
---
Repeater crossbow would be amazing
---
Wow great job mine looks sloppy as shit
---
I would love for a weapon similar to the World series baseball bat. So many open areas in the game to test it out on.
---
If you’re a rifleman. Take off the rifleman perk cards and also your nerd rage if you have it. These can take the very low damage and make it kill a frog or maybe a dog.
---
Crazy, but first roll was two star, Bloody FFR; if only I had the same luck with SS armor.
---
its one of the first hacks we learned on how to trade exclusives between systems. and how to mess with the economy. as an example the alligator backpack is worth $5.00 on pc but $50.00 on console because of duping.  so an esay way to make bank would be to stock up on them on pc. and take half to ps4 and half to xbone and  quadruple your money. they would love to make 1 server for us all. but the bad apples prevent that. for every good person there are 10 times as many aholes.
---
He's shooting things that looks like monsters and sometimes a little blood pops out. 
---
You're making sanctimonious douche choices.
---
I've only used bows in NW, is the drop rate drastically different in adventure?
---
Obviously the ratings are wrong right and kids minds are fully developed at 7 or 8 nowadays so they cant be influenced by immoral actions in a game.
---
Yea it keeps getting worse, I've been fighting depression for a while, but it's just an uphill struggle at this point
---
I know right? Some of Bethesda's bugs are actually OK (I said it).
---
Also issue where when you move cursor to top of the map you get a rainbow glitch effect and is hard to see the map.
---
3rd person view solves that. no scope needed
---
happens quite a bit actually
---
I was telling my fallout 76 roaming buddy about it and he was laughing maniacally just at the imagery and story of how I literally was wanging ghouls into lampposts whilst doing the musical jungle out loud myself along with it. 
---
I had such great times with that thing. I’d absolutely go full melee for that. Can you imagine smashing scorched everywhere during a queen fight? Them flying into the distance or at her as she’s hovering about.
---
Low creativity = jackass griefer (low imagination loser).
---
High creativity = respect (but still maybe jackass griefer - that deserves respect, and maybe a head shaking smile).
---
Anywhere from 5-10k last i checked. I paid 4k for one about a week ago.
---
Shh.
---
Two shot ffr 50dr
---
You can also just drop things on the ground. This way you don't have to find containers with no weight limit
---
Why didn’t you just make him set the gauntlet at 8.5k caps tho?
---
Rule 9 is so hard.
---
I was very not thinking big time stupid
---
You need to read rule No. 9, also have some common sense.
---
First of all you are breaking sub rules, and second you provide zero evidence.
---
This but unironically
---
I wouldn’t recommend that. I’ve lost things that way. Dropped a paper bag, came back with second character, bag is there with nothing in it. I’ve seen other redditors have this happen too.
---
Because it's not false advertising you twit.  Bethesda has delivered everything they explicitly advertised AND MORE since they've also been giving away free shit every month that was never in the deal.  If you'd ever read some of those threads you'd know they're bullshit as well.  It's always someone complaining that the free stuff for that month isn't good enough or that Bethesda should be giving more free stuff away every month or whining that the additional features that Bethesda has never given details never given details or timetables on like enhancements for private worlds havent materialized yet.  That's why I shit on these people, because they're just a bunch of entitled fucking crybabies that don't even understand what they paid for.
---
Ahh I didn't know that I took all of the gold and to be honest the grinding out the rep kills me inside I just can't with this game anymore lol, I took all of the gold and haven't spent a bar yet. I figured it would of been harder for the gold than the rep.
---
Overseer is dissapoint.
---
Is that one of the relics you have to find for "COME GET YA HICKORY-SMOKED SWATTA!", or is it a quest reward? I never finished that one for him. I think I got sidetracked with building settlements... again.
---
Appalachian legion? A bunch of Fash larpers lol
---
That poison damage is insane, and I haven't really found anything that protects against it. I kind of hope if it is a bug, that it doesn't get fixed, this build is a blast to play with.
---
The issue is not the drop rate,but the acc...sometimes in point blank enemies where you clearly aim for the head or body your arrows can't hit,glowing sights help a little but the error still happens
---
No one is saying the game needs to focus on PvP but like this comment and all the others seem to miss is that just because PvP players are a minority doesn't mean they should get completely shafted. I have no problem helping prevent players from being griefed but this change does more than that. It hurts the players who are legitimately interested in PvP and it seems like the PvE crowed just doesn't care.
---
I literally suggest a change that works to prevent players from being griefed without removing the ability to have team fights for those that want it, but because the current system can be abused by griefers every one seems to completely ignore it. Seriously, if you're a PvE only player chances are your running pacifist (you should be at least) so what would be the big deal if the change only affected you? If you don't have pacifist checked it should mean you're okay to PvP under normal circumstances, and if you do have it checked it should only not work in Workshops and PvP events.
---
TSE wasn't nerfed into oblivion purely because of the PvP crowd. It was a lot of PvE players who complained the same way they do now about getting themselves involved in PvP when they had no business. It wasn't just that either. People whined and complained the same way they do about Bloodied builds one shotting everything. The PvE crowd were the ones that got TSE nerfed, not the PvP crowd let's get that straight. Regardless, two wrongs don't make a right, so even if you're correct its still irrelevant. 
---
For fans of the Fallout series many players here seem to forget that it's an RPG that lets you play your character how you choose. That means if you want you can be the bad guy. In a multiplayer Fallout game, did anyone really expect anyone not to play the role of the bad guy? I'm not saying "raiders" and PvPers have to be loved, but you'd think that players that had experience in a game world that has always shown the thick grey line between the black and white would have an easier time coping with players who weren't trying to "rebuild America" with you. This was never advertised as co-op Fallout with friends, it was supposed to be a survival-lite game. I just want it to retain the features that have been around since the game was announced to the public, since that's what interested me. Not some hypothetical FO multiplayer game I had imagined in my head, but what was actually presented to us.
---
This is actually the most common answer to alleviate this.
---
Sucks, but it’s true.
---
I found a camp earlier that looked totally normal up there was a keypad door with the number above. I couldn’t resist. Went inside and BAM rad traps everywhere. 
---
I wasn’t even mad. Up the fact I had to go out of my way to spring the trap made me laugh more than anything else. I was able to put on the stealth suit and go pick up my junk and fast travel away too.
---
Yeah your camp is safe. I check out what people gave done with "my" spot. Usually it's just a shitty box build. Which is a massive shame. Because you can utilise the surroundings very well.
---
griefing jerks. can you imagine what these idiots are like in real life? I'm not a pvp guy but I'm all for it if that's your thing. but destroying peoples hard work on their camps is just wrong. luckily it's just a glitch and should be fixed shortly. I'm a fallout 1st member and would gladly donate resources to help you build it back up...
---
.556 handgun or That Gun.
---
wont work if someone builds there house on top of that hill blocking you from placing your tent. then you can only stand there. and if its just you and a lvl 25 at the event then thats not a option. and ofc the person who built there house there is standing in the edge of there house afk so he can complete the event lol
---
You have to use VATS or the dmg gets bugged and rebounds the HP. I have a two shot limb dmg gauss shotgun and I can take down the SBQ in under a minute as long as I use VATS. Limb dmg is a magic weapon effect for shotguns but you have to use VATS for it to work. Idk how VATS isn't working well for you because with mine every other shot is like a sniper and will 1 shot shit from across the map with every pellet hitting.
---
This☝️☝️☝️
---
Congrats he is gonna be a great player one day
---
Is this some bug that happens sometimes? I've never had issues so far
---
if you are bloody you may also have to fill up some of your hp to do less damage
---
I’ve noticed that if an enemy turns into an ash pile or goo pile while in the air, the loot pile doesn’t fall to the ground, It stays floating in the air and it’s invisible from below, so the only way to retrieve it, is a jet pack.
---
T45 was used as the base for the medic power armor so if you want to recreate it use the t-45 it shouldn’t matter which version of T-45 you use though.
---
If you can't get the awesome Croc backpack Blue Ridge is the second best you can get in game without paying atoms imo. All the other backpacks you can get in game are just reskins of the default.
---
It's extremely easy to farm the Riding Shotgun event back to back by server hopping though. You can start the quest manually at any time as long as it's not on cooldown for the server. The backpack plans still seem rare but just keep that in mind so someone doesn't rip you off.
---
I was thinking about dodgy, but since my action points are lower I was worried it wouldn't activate very often. I'm not sure how much ap it uses.
---
Oh that's weird, I haven't really used them at close range, other than a double tap to the chest in NW with crossbows for an almost instant kill,
---
But the exploding bow makes me hesitant to ever use it at that kind of range
---
&gt;This is an open-world role-playing game in which players must survive/thrive in a post-apocalyptic world. From a first- or third-person perspective, players search for supplies/food while battling other survivors and mutant creatures. Players use machetes, machine guns, rocket launchers, and grenades to kill ghoul-like creatures and other enemies in frenetic combat. Some weapons allow players to blow ghouls apart, resulting in flying limbs and chunks of flesh; wounded characters can also be executed with gunshots to the head, resulting in decapitation. The game includes frequent references to drugs called Chems, which are sometimes used as plot points for characters; Chems can be found, manufactured, and used to enhance performance/skills of characters, though there is no actual depiction of use. A handful of story missions require players' character to acquire ingredients to make alcoholic beverages; one alcoholic drink (Nukashine) can discolor and/or cause the screen to blur after being consumed. The words “f\*\*k” and “sh\*t” appear in the dialogue. 
---
Keep telling yourself you're doing the right thing.  It will become true, I'm sure of it.
---
the emote thing can be easily remedied by going into photomode it will stop it
---
If you have watched the video, you would see that it is not calculating the armour penetration with the buffs included
---
I have T-45 PA Chestpiece with Medical Pump, and recalled it 'MP-47/A'. As for other parts I keep them unnamed. Although I wish I could paint it white~
---
Yeah....but NW is a explosive bow,i imagine that issue is not on splash dmg
---
I've never seen my two shot automatic Tesla rifle fill my screen with so many damage markers. Truly a glorious sight to behold between the stutter and frame rate drops.
---
Well you can still get the other sides stuff bye geinding tour rep all the way up but i would get the chineese stealth suit off the settlers if you havent if your going to side with raiders why you ask , simple its super fun lol
---
You can help both sides until you've reached the "Side with..." quests for each faction. The game makes it clear this is the point of no return. If you do this, you won't miss out on anything. Whoever you dont side with will still talk to you and give you quests and you can gain rep with both to unlock all their rewards.
---
Hey sorry, made a quick edit, I was too slow lol
---
Just make sure when buying armor or power armor you buy the actual plan not the mod or you’ll be asking why can’t u build my armor.  Lol.
---
10mm shoulder mounted lmg from new Vegas.  That way the 10mm round is actually useful after level 10.  I've always said that each ammo type needs a heavy weapon.
---
Nah it’s just a spawn in Jamaica plains in the basement with the displays. Always made a beeline for it right away
---
If you want to side with the Settlers then go ahead. You will still have opportunities with Raiders.
---
Look into junkies
---
i understand what you want sir/maam and how easy it is to actually implement. and ive been apart of games and programs that used to allow it. and they had a peer review team whos sole job was to look at everything 24/7 to tray and keep it safe. and it became to much of a hassle and they removed the features. its virtually impossible to prevent picture editing on pc and thus if you take a screen shot you can move and or replace it with any image. which is fine since its only visible on your screen. but the instant you allow a group of 10 year olds to be able to post stuff otehrs ca see. booom its ruined for everyone.. now if if if. they simply made it to where the images tha appeared in the frames were only visiable by you. and no one else. then you got a shot. i walk by and its just my loading screens in your frames. hey that dude likes my exploded mirlock  shot. you go boy.
---
If you're on PC I'll give you 5k for it. I've been looking for one for a while, and it's the last piece I need to complete the blue ridge set.
---
Haha totally agree there
---
Yeah that’s happened to me.  I never go to that event nowadays. It’s either too boring or bugged like this
---
Can you explain why this change is better than my suggestion? In case you didn't actually read my post I propose that the change only affects those that have pacifist turned on to ensure only the players who are actively trying to avoid PvP will no longer be forced in. Pacifist could even be made the default option so players have to deselect it to opt in so that ignorant players aren't getting baited in.
---
Why should a separate mode be dedicated to PvP when it can be completely avoided (barring exploits that NEED to be fixed) by those that choose to?
---
I believe siding with them does not matter too much each side has rewards from higher reputation with them which you can gain by doing their dailies and random encounters, I'm not sure what the raiders give you as I haven't done it but I got the Chinese stealth suit from siding with settlers, but after the quest, you can get Max reputation for both anyways
---
I think you could use pretty much what I'm using, but instead of emergency protocols on the power armor, I'd use kinetic dynamo, and maybe use dodgy instead of nerd rage. Kinetic dynamo recharges action points whenever you get hit, dodgy protects you from damage at the expense of action points, so every time you get hit you'd be refilling your ap while dodgy protects you from a portion of the damage.
---
Sir, this is a feature for almost one year. I can even explain how if you are on ps4
---
You should be able to replace without having to remove them.
---
I'm on ps4 sorry
---
Highlight and choose the replace option?
---
https://i.imgur.com/TjU7bSY.jpg
---
Very easy but lost my first item a call couple days ago due to server crash. It was the first transfer I've lost after hundreds of transfers but it was enough to teach me a lesson. I still transfer aid, ammo, etc without a second thought but wouldn't recommend transferring anything of high value/multiple items by yourself. 
---
Do not try dropping items on the ground on a private by yourself! I've tested that a couple times and the item is never there.
---
It says right on the card how much it uses...
---
If I delete the item, do I need to remove their custom clothing or will it respawn with them?
---
? when you go to store/scrap  a floor it should say "replace" then you can do exactly what you are asking
---
Ah well, the hunt continues.
---
I know this I have a max modded hunting rifle that I have been using since launch, (I'm assuming that you mean damage per shot) have all of the mods unlocked, and DPS shouldn't matter with hunting rifles as it is a slow fire rate weapon. Therefore in my mind it makes sense to maximize your first shot damage, and my hardened receiver does 139 ( with 3 rifleman perk cards) and my .50 does 136.
---
It'll automatically go back into your stash
---
Then the Devs can fix it. If they don't want people to do it this way. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
You must rage at any Bethesda speedruns that come across your way, all they do is glitch and exploit.
---
You can run all quests for both sides until you get “Siding with ...” as an option. You can run the 79 raid with either faction, then after, you can continue to earn reputation for both sides leading to Ally status and those rewards. It’s very hard to miss out on quest rewards if you constantly play both sides.
---
Love meat week! Hoping there’s a new Tenderisor unique weapon to try for!
---
Dinner bell
---
3* hunters Dr while aiming bashing damage. Facepalm
---
already gone through that pain with combat armour lol, but thanks for the advice
---
We need a toggle for all ally voices stat, like we toggle it and no one (not even us) hears them talk anymore.
---
Does the mining helmet have a usable torch?  I'm sooo getting one of those. Hate the green pip boy light
---
Hoping for junkies ffr rw (or fr) or bloodied ffr fr
---
Why not?  There’s regularly a daily atom challenge to build floors, walls, doors, etc at camp.  
---
Equip contractor 2, delete and recreate the floor piece.  instant atoms, and a new look, too :)
---
Isn't that the norm now?  I rarely have more then 1-3 enemies spawn over entire event anymore.  Way more fun when it was a flood of mutants.
---
As someone with a retirement camp that’s 2x max budget and very carefully wired up (with some wires in the foundations), you can definitely change the floor types (wood or concrete) and the styles of those pieces without disrupting anything on that piece or wires going through them. It’s doable and totally safe. 
---
On PS4, select the floor, hit square, then triangle, then change the design
---
Completing the event guided meditation usually gives you some
---
drop and sway. in PVE 20 yards away. target standing still me squated invisible. not moving using vat. 95% acc no penalties on my end. 4 archery cards.draw and fire and fire. right past his head. he moves. fires second shot still misses. cuss the screen switch to rifle BOOOOM. hes dead and everyone knows im here. in NW doesnt seem to suffer as much of a drop or the sway. i guess its a bonus since you get no vats
---
Yes it does!! You'll find plenty of them about. Comes in multiple colours.
---
Ideally I want something else though. I like my ugly mug to be covered.
---
Protip: you can change colour of light colour at workbench :)
---
Or just make it a skin that can be applied to any helmet.
---
You let a 9 year old play a game where you can shoot a person in the head and their skull shatters and flies all over the place and you see nothing wrong with that?
---
And you "skip dialogue"?
---
You feel that the word fuck is more of a problem than brains getting splattered all over the place?
---
This is the most "dumb american" thing I've read all day.
---
Nipples bad, violence not a problem.
---
Go play Cod, kid.
---
oh, duh. I can't believe I didn't notice that.
---
How hard is it for people to find a new server? I hate it when people do that!
---
Go be judgy someplace else.
---
Assualtron you can get from the shop in summersville. Not sure if you can only get in there on that quest though.
---
Huh... Don't we already *have* that option? On PS4, at least, I know most walls and floors have a "Swap" option (Triangle, I think?) that lets you change it out with a similar piece, while keeping it in the same place, and without affecting any objects attached to it.
---
Thanks! I'm glad it worked for you!
---
I am at the exact same Point right now. Don't feel like it, don't feel like playing any game at all. Just tired.
---
Once pvp starts, it tends to be over before turrets react. Turrets should target the other player though. That being said they can destroy your entire base then too.
---
Turrets won’t target until pvp starts.
---
 Can you?  I tried changing the pip boy but it doesn't give me any mods.
---
Maybe that's what it is, I'll try one in adventure today, you got me curious. I've had pretty good results with the explosive in nw
---
Cheers to you, friend! Thanks!
---
Ooh okay , thank you very much.
---
Pip boy can only be changed in the Pref.ini file. For PC users.
---
I don't even get why they came out with such a lame excuse it's clear to everyone what they were doing it for
---
Everyone gets to make their own parenting choices.  I'm glad this kiddo has a dad who is spending time doing things together with him.  Go be judgy someplace else.
---
THIS 
---
I'm lvl 60 and still wearing the same 3* leather armor chest piece I put on at lvl 10
---
 Has it dropped on the roof?  I've had that happen before.
---
nope. doesnt work. mine doesnt have a quest. no matter which one i place. none of them will give me a quest anymore. i have all of the allies. ive scraped the spawn item. rotated them. left them out for a week . still nothing
---
In case anyone didn't know, the GMG charges as you shoot, do it has a natural furious effect that stacks with Furious. With my Furious FFR, big gun bobblehead (hopefully works with this), overdrive, and full adrenaline, I was doing 140 dmg per bullet while shooting the queen in the face. I use primed with the OG single barrel, because the tri barrel didn't do it for me.
---
We all have our duh moments. I've been there.
---
Watch for the red smoke plume.
---
ITs alos possible somone else found it, picked the lock, and looted it. (When emptied, the smoke plume goes away.)
---
Ah ok.  Just re read your post.  Thought you meant you can change the pip boy light.
---
Like I said it doesn't fix the bug. This is mainly if you have a quest alrrady active. That bug is gettijg fixed ij the next patch though
---
I've gotta downvote this. Being able to forge one armor into another is going to remove a lot of the struggle of getting your character better and getting better armor. My example of this is to say that I get old wood armor and then what can crafted into scout armor? Secret service armor once I get those?
---
Honestly what I think of better solution would be is the ability to keep the same type of armor but reroll the legendaries on it for a certain amount of script. With that though keep the same star rating of legendary so you can't make a 1-star into a 3-star.
---
I dont think it has, I dont see any of the orange smoke anywhere either
---
You can.. But only on PC.
---
There is no smoke plume
---
Immune to punjis? How?
---
Why would you need to optimize?
---
This game is ridiculously easy. I can 1 shot everything in the game with 1 bullet.
---
I am a sneaky rifleman that is nowhere near optimized.
---
Batteries included is a must. I run rank 3 bloody mess, rank 2 grenadier, and rank 3 demo (so I can also fit rank 3 stabilized and rank 3 nerd rage), and the thing is a damn street sweeper. If I just aim in the general direction of a group of mobs, things explode.
---
Good news! I did the sack in the cart and it worked. Transferred about 20 legendaries over. My heart was pounding the whole time in fear of the server crashing haha
---
I remember I started playing fallout 76 back when it first came out on pc. and I recall getting notifications for when my camp was under attack. I stopped playing a few months after that because it kept crashing. And I only recently picked it up again on PS4 and I did notice that that notification does not appear.
---
Light Step makes you immune to floor traps while sneaking.
---
Yeah I do this for a lot of games to be honest.  I've certainly been doing this with 76 lately.  Gone back to playing Darkest Dungeon and working on P5R on the PS4 because I haven't been feeling it for other games right now.  I usually cycle between 76, Xcom2, Civ6, Stellaris and whatever tickles my fancy on the PS4 because there's all sorts of stuff I've only partly finished on there.
---
if this is already an option i have never seen it. ill have to check it out when the game is done reinstalling lol. im on pc btw, and everyone who responded is on ps4 so i dont know
---
It’s not worth it in my opinion.
---
Bring back the 12.7mm SMG!
---
I’ll keep an eye out, I may have some on a mule. Are you on PC, PS4, or XB1?
---
Ok, how the heck do you get The damage up that much?
---
No dice for me. (PC) :(
---
They can't even make fast travel work right. Imagine the cluster that would result from them fooling around with something like this.
---
Most these punji trap camps kill you instantly, as they clip through your body when triggered? Its literally repaired and then BAM 200 punjis all up in your grill
---
Sounds like a lot of the adults in game too :P
---
I don’t think it’s a bug, Bethesda listened to people’s complains and made many weapons builds now viable. No more bashing the bashing, many effects are useful now, the rule of the explosive and FFR is over 👍
---
Wish the condition bar would freeze at the last tick and stay as is and only spoil if you remove it. It's kind of bonkers that they let you display certain items that spoil and not other items that don't.
---
New Vegas always brings me back
---
There is a ton more wastelanders content. Work on your story missions in your data tab. That will give you the original story and thr wastelanders add ons.
---
There really isn’t one. I actually find it almost like they care about their community and their past games, even as much shuns obsidian and Vegas.
---
IRC, there are (at least) 6 that spawn in various places inside the robco building.  There may be others - last couple of times I was there, either I missed them, or they had already been looted..  
---
The chess set in the frat house at Morgantown has several, but IDK if they are similar size/style as the ones rom Robco
---
Yep it seems that bug is still here and they did not fix it.....
---
Please take the post down and never speak of it no one wants Bethesda to fix this
---
I would like to the ability to craft what we want.  Keep it as non tradable, increase the scrip cost to craft it.  The whole Idea of spending 100 scrip to randomly get a 1\* or a 3\* piece of crap is crazy.  People would still grind and still play.  They could make it level dependent for what how many stars are on the items and what items you can craft.  They could leave the stuff like fixers and bear arms to mumbles, and they could introduce some new weapons and armor types.  Sorry ranting
---
Pretty sure light step still stops the damage if you're sneaking. Even at shoulder height, they're still floor traps according to the game.
---
I saw this last night for the first time.  It was absolutely hilarious.  There were probably 6 or 7 of us, all shooting scorched in a barrel.  And to add insult to injury, they would spawn without clothing (at least for an instant)
---
This was way too low on the list.  It's been my favorite weapon in every Fallout game, and I've always added it via mods for games released without it.
---
If survival mode eve came back, it would be cool if they did a camp defense overhaul. I'd love to have a camo bear trap that activates a garage door or power gate with turrets / flame traps behind it.
---
I guess it’s a bug, I have no idea how the devs want you to transfer gear, but it only has to happen to you once and you won’t do not that way ever again.
---
Occasionally in the swimming pool locker room at Bolton Greens.
---
I’ll give that a go, thanks
---
What level are you at.my perk cards were messed up by the time I hit 50 so between 50 to 65 I redid my perks to suit me.but unless you have solid weapons armor try and farm legendaries for better gear.start the enclave quest get a nuke under your belt.there is a bit to do I still have a few main quests I havent completed
---
I can buy on Sundays
---
That is a very, very bad idea.
---
I know the feeling! But it gets a little easier each time. I’ve never had anything lost this way, and I have had the server crash. If that happens don’t panic, just get back into private ASAP!
---
Dude you play with a nipples mod? To each his own...
---
Took me nearly a month but I took all the gold for myself and only did the daily
---
The raider raid is infinitely better and more fun than the foundation raid. Better rewards too IMO.
---
Careful doig that... I lost weapons doing that once. I loaded weapons into a containter, and after switching characters I kept getting a message when I tried to rejoin saying something like unable to join or find the world (I forget exactly what the message said..) but I wasnt able to get back I to my server before it reset.....
---
&gt; and not other items that don't
---
Like a complete Giddy-up Buttercup. I'd love to have one of those at my camp.
---
If they end up being better, I'm totally okay with that.
---
u/ladydevann
---
.i had about 5 of them but during the time the displays were disabled some how they were scrapped into lead.so stopped looking for them
---
Explosive rounds in an Anti-Material Rifle.
---
I could take out a group of Legion Assassins with two shots, due to the splash damage, alone. That thing was a monster.
---
Thanks I'll have to check it out again. I think I have 5 original models and 3 parts models.
---
Now you need to get a nice set of power armour.
---
I know this was meant to be a joke, but it's actually a prime example of what I was talking about.
---
Humans have nipples. There is nothing wrong with them, nor are they a big deal.
---
Okay. Thanks so much for the help!
---
and then they become wanted. had this happen once was running through seen the crate and picked the lock. thought it was a nuke code drop (didnt bother reading the label) was disappointed and wanted lol 
---
unless your doing it for a challenge don't worry about it you can get more and better loot off a scorched lol
---
5 to 6 weeks on average, longer if you don't do them every. single. day. Ugh.
---
When I get into this kinda slump/burnout I bust out my old consoles. Gameboy Advance SP and play Golden Sun or Pokemon. Hook up the Gamecube and play Paper Mario (1k door), SM Sunshine, or Twilight Princess. And the N64 for any of a dozen games (imo the N64 is the best console ever made)
---
Much appreciated!!
---
Its on all versions, works with walls too
---
With enough time, every long term player will have a working version of their ideal set of SS armor.   I have seen a sharp decline in armor sales at my vendor unless they are heavy or scout and have dropped prices on most pieces.
---
I guess I'm finding a new location then. Thanks for the info.
---
For the love of god yes please. I want more info on the zetan’s and their master invasion plan
---
Bloodied ffr 50dr
---
The sniper rifle or anti material
---
WTB tactical nuclear arrow warheads
---
I just wish they'd keep the option to trade in perks in the meantime. I'm so sick of fucking scrolling through my cards to find what I want
---
Will you respond if they do get back to you and fix it?
---
Thanks. I'm not in PTS but glad to see another confirmation of June 30 Patch Update.
---
What do you mean by most of your weapons have 'duplicated'? If you haven't made anything on your account to dupe something then I would say someone had access to your account and duped your weapons although that sounds odd because you said the dupes still were there.
---
At various times I've had captured frogs, Gnomes, Frog Habitats, Pickled Ghoul body parts, different glowing bottles (eg Nuka Cola, Nukashine, Westek Yellow Goo), Hats, Teapots, various clean items...
---
Theres a lot of odds and ends out there and I'm waiting for normal display shelves to become available again as not everything is at its best inside the glass cabinets.
---
thats true lol
---
i’m on xbox, it was obviously a visual glitch i must’ve dropped the visual one causing the game to crash
---
If you side with the settlers, you'll miss out on possibly getting the "Slug Buster", but that's about the only thing that I can think of.  You won't miss anything important.  The best quest reward weapon IMO is related to Beckett's questline.
---
It's because the only two PA mods for arms are those and the rusty knuckles. Optimized Bracers are the better choice of the two
---
Oh that makes much more sense now, sorry for your weapons dude :(
---
I have a quad 33, another magic weapon and it does extremely well.  Vats can be a little quirky but you need to get use to how to fire the gun.
---
Well, I randomly found one before and it had a nuke code in it idk what to do with it, but I would like to find this one and make the quest marker go away
---
Edit: Nuclear Keycard not the code
---
Nor is a blood spurt from a monster. I skip dialogue because there is a fair chance a 9 year old would repeat fuck or shit because he heard it in a game. There is zero chance he would fashion a pipe gun from scrap laying around the house and kill mole rats. I personally would not let a 9 year old watch a gory movie depicting realistic violence. Cartoonish fallout stuff against monsters isn't going to make him violent any more than a racing game is going to make him speed later in life.
---
Mods wouldn't impact your experience as much, we heavy gunners primeraly rely on perks, stabilized is a must have for example. 
---
Depending on your weapon you'll also be eating up lots of ammo, so get ammosmith and superduper if you want to go a step further.
---
Me too.  Quality over quantity
---
The dead alien is an animatronic, using the same models from Nuka World.
---
That’s an old visual bug that hasn’t been mentioned in a very long time. You see two, but really only have one.
---
Fast Travel mats were Beta only. But the notifications were in retail release.
---
Not anymore though, it seems.
---
Honestly there's a bunch of options that could / should be togglable in the options menu, or maybe make a holotape that you can insert in a terminal and let you choose CAMP settings like notifications, disabling vending machines, choosing an icon for our camp, etc
---
Lol.. I think the helmet is the best part - especially when paired with the Plague Doctor mask.  It makes my character look likee he has an Angry Bird mutation. 😁
---
Nice! I'll have to try that spot out next time I'm there 😁. Thanks for letting me know.
---
I didn't consider PC when posting this, granted. However, pictures are available in this game in the form of paintings, could they be edited to have the same effect? Mustn't be the case? So could you not implement these photos on the same directory with the same controls? If not then fair play, this is some wishful thinking, but that's all it was to begin with.
---
Apologies but your wording made it seem like you were thinking I was making some kind of demand. I'm not aware of the limitations, but all information is knowledge so I'm definitely not against any counter claims. If it can't be done, it can't be done, no love lost!
---
Try For Honor. Nice game, but what's really great is the amount of salty players. All the hatemails I ever received come from that game.
---
None of the power armor arm mods give you any benefits when using ranged weapons. They are all for melee or unarmed. You can leave arms empty or use optimized bracers if you have a backup melee weapon.
---
Bloodied 33v +1p
---
T to replace.
---
There used to be one, back in the day. 
---
Newer players might not know this, but when the game was new anyone could destroy someone else's camp.
---
my daughter used to play fallout new vegas and 3 with me when she was about that age. What she liked was the trading. After I got through a quest or whatever I'd holler at her and she'd come in and do all the trading.
---
I want a nuclear winter game where there's 50 people in Gladiator  "Legion" costume and 50 people in the NCR costume and lets see who kicks more ass!!!! NCR ALL THE WAY MOTHER FUCKERS!!!!!!!
---
Always have a eye in the PST forum... nice tidbits from the devs...like the pvp changes...or the legendary perks flop....
---
I'm disappointed by beckett when he puts it on as he refuses to remove his tightie tightie whities,  ruining the look some what..
---
Boi you are one lucky soab
---
Very nice. I just got a vampire's version with the exact same other 2 rolls and it hits hard, I can't imagine how much harder a bloodied one will hit jeez.
---
yup and i lost my end game bloodied fixer 🤦🏽‍♂️
---
Mixed feelings.  Nice to see they are putting the release candidate patch for all practical purposes up, but the patch is less than a week away.  What bugs would be addressed in that small timeframe?
---
Give outer worlds a try?
---
And high level players are losing out because of perk packs, until that update comes all our duplicate maxed out perks are just getting fizzled into nonexistence, and you won't receive any perk coins for them when the update drops. And you really want those extra tokens, you'll only be able to max 1-2 perks as a level 300 character if you scrap everything you don't want
---
I live in the city where a guy won a bowling alley. I have never been able to confirm if someone really did win a bowling alley....
---
It is super fun to use.  As someone else recommended dodgy is nice to have.  There are slight differences between our builds and that's one of them but about 75 percent of this looks like my loadout.
---
I’ll rip some events always looking for people to play with
---

Psn: alphaboomer
---
Probably the "baton" skin.
---
Look at that woman's face.  That ain't a weapon.
---
There are 4 mods. Hydraulic bracers, optimized bracers, rusty knuckles and tesla bracers.
---
Emergency protocols, max life giver, speed demon &amp; healing factor mutation.  Paired with nerd rage ur basically in god mode.  Just keep moving.  Standing still will get you dead.
---
&gt;So vats can be a little tricky.  I have a few of these now and I have gotten use to shooting them.  First you need to kit it out to improve hip fire accuracy.  Aliened everything.  Also, put it vats before you charge up that helps.  I run with maxed out concentrated fire and that help a lot as well.  And orange mentas does not hurt.  I still have to deal with missing sometimes but all in all I am having a better experience.  Also I am running all shot gun perks maxed out.  I think its skeet shooter the improves the accuracy.  the base accuracy on these things is bad.
---
yeah /: sucks butt and there’s nothing i can do about it
---
Ok. Cool. I see people talking about shortcuts - like lockpicking through a door, rather than using a computer terminal somewhere - and was wondering if there were some non-obvious ways for a solo player to get through without help. Thanks!
---
off course.
---
Yeah, It’s tough man I can for sure relate. You on xbox? I’m always down to conquer the wastes with new people
---
Last week when the servers went down, I found myself on Borderlands 2 and loved it! Compared to the online 76, B2 felt really fluid..
---
Back on 76 of course, but enjoyed the change..
---
YCS/186
---
Loved that gun. It was a one shot-reload gauss riffle that packed a punch like no other. It killed most enemies with a single headshot and I loved it. Snipers need more love in 76. I became a mele/heavy weapons because my snipers did shit to enemies.
---
lmao karen
---
Upvoted for level of effort.
---
Not that I know of :(
---
that does work well most of the time.  Maxed concentrated fire and skeet shooter help as well.  Also kit it out with everything that is aligned.
---
A smaller version could be possible to make on a private server if you took over the Tyler park worship or whatever then made sure everyone got one hit off on every first to start pvp, then just last one standing
---
I actually really enjoyed the alien DLC. It's one thing that still stands out in my brain from playing it. If they did it right I'd enjoy having something like that again.
---
WEEEEEK
---
Exactly!! Me too!!
---
I should upvote every smartass comment ITT.  Well done boys.
---
The SMMG would look super badass with PA on 76
---
Typical brotherhood bullshit
---
Holy shit are you me? KOTOR 2 and Fable TLC are my favorite games of all time. I assume you grew up playing original xbox as well?
---
Furious ffr 2* and a Troubleshooter's ffr aiming. Had some very nice Junkies and Bloodied come up, but I don't run those.
---
The *season part* is the only untested... the rest of patch 20 have several weeks of testing. Because the test the delay on legendary and wendigo colossus 
---
The fixes are listed on the PTS forums...
---
Not right now. They were supposed to have a silent version that they added but it’s talking again
---
dose it remove everything on the floor like trying to change the wallpaper on a wall? and thanks i didn't know this was a option already as my game is currently reinstalling
---
I understand not wanting to carry a duped weapon but the amount of times I've seen this post where it's 
---
"found it has duped so I dropped one, now both are gone"
---
Before any mention of relogging, rebooting, storing one or both, trading one to a friend or even putting in a ticket. People are just dropping them without any thought that it could be a visual glitch. I mean sure it sucks your guns gone but is it really a lot of people's first thoughts to just throw it away before trying anything...anything else.
---
This.
---
Cheers!
---
Woah woah woah. Woah. You can own a deathclaw?!
---
Nope, you can use brick or metal walls though
---
Ugh yes it is

Sweet! I'm MDT timezone,

Don't forget Travel Agent lol
---
This.  I split the gold and just got to max rank with both factions about a week ago.
---
Ok thanks I just heard that it was nerf for update 20.
---
Man you aren't going to believe this but sometimes they make games that aren't Fallout.
---
Honestly though if you're on PC or XBox just get game pass. There's certainly something there to snap you out of your funk
---
EDIT: IF and ONLY IF your funk is being burned out on Fallout. If your depression stems from other sources then I am sincerely sorry to see it and wish you well.
---
I’m such a cheap SOB that’s on at all times haha
---
Lol anytime I see a trap camp I just bring in 30 nuke mines around their doors and workbenches and I throw some explosive bait at their generator and vendors
---
One of my sets of PA is LIberty Prime and the OMW helmet...and I swear I heard it talking the other day
---
Don't worry about it. Nobody uses mic in fallout 76 :D Atleast random people in the game world don't..
---
I've only played foNV all the way through once, so as soon as I'm done with TLOU2, I think I'm going to do that on PC with texture and other mods. It's a bit of work to setup, but I'm pretty excited.
---
the BOS heavy torso is better than scout, but scout limbs are better than BOS heavy limbs
---
One point about the Pitt that wasn't explored is the speach that is given by (i forgot his name) the leader "We will be the envy of Ronto" aka Torronto. I know it ain't got nothing to do with 76 but it's something that seems interesting.
---
i was at foundation, and was very tired from the drive back just wanted to sit back a relax for a couple hours so i didn’t really think anything, and it was late so no friend was on lol.
---
visit vault 88,

under the bridge nearby gorge's junkyard! look for the 64 on the map
---
For the most part, they only care about the major bugs that affect systems and stability or major game-play mechanics. If they held back the patch to catch and fix every possible issue it could create then you'll never actually get the patch out. They're always going to be fixing things one way or another if they add new features and content this much. More time in the PTS isn't going to help much more than it may hurt by limiting the patch to only those people in the PTS. It sucks, but the best way to catch a bug is with more people and most people are on the live server.
---
\*Raises Hand in sadness.
---
How do you mean ?
---
Kinda? You have to do some trickery. To initially stack, you'll need a foundation in the ground that also touches its side with a rock wall. Then snap another foundation next to it, then stairs going towards the first, then place the upper foundation, then remove stairs. After that, you can snap foundations down the line.
---
It's like, I want to get through some of the Fallout 4 quest mods I downloaded, but I like the game mechanics in Fallout 76 better.
---
So with that in mind if you increase your perception with something like sweet water blend that should help as well correct?  Another guy was saying full set of unyielding armor which would significantly increase perception was working for him
---
So that everyone can have the same min/maxed armor for their group role? I think it’s more fun and more random for people to have to scramble and take time to get the build they want, it makes the full set of whatever type that much cooler.
---
and you’re playing FO76..??
---
B33RW
---
yes on pc you can edit the dat files to achieve all kids of results. for example eding a skin of a weapon and changing it to appear to be a different weapon. or replacing the underwear skin your avatar uses to one that is more realistic. doing these type of mods/hacks only visually effect the local system. since no data is transferd visually. in old school mmo rpg's we would change the dat file for a small treasure chest into a large blinking pot .so we could speed run dungeons for loot.  more advanced hack would allow a person to equip well say any attachment on any weapon. this could result in well say a fully automatic rocket launcher. or armor with every mod. these require a lot more knowledge in the coding and exploiting weaknesses in the programs. which 95% of the people don't know how to do. but logistically  your dream would be a nice decorative improvement over the cat paintings. but since it would cause the servers to be over stressed keeping track of the constantly changing screen shots loading in and out every couple of second. from the endless amount of persons who are server hopping. or entering your area. they do not want to increase the resources on the server. server lag is one of the main components used in many of the dup exploits they are targeting to stop. it would be a nice mod to have on a non mmo. it is just not something tehy can afford to waste the rever stability on.
---
Unless its been changed, the max is *30%*
---
And it completely clears your rads, so its useless for Bloodied PA builds (aka a third or more of PA players)
---
Meat Week first started in August last year, then repeated in September. I would assume this August then at the latest.
---
yes I'm why?
---
They’re not indestructible but they’re more difficult to break (technically it’s doesn’t really matter because they’ve been buffed)
---
Something in Cincinatti could be coolio since the river goes down to there so it could be a possibility, but there is very little lore involving that area.
---
I'm just saying it's honestly like the fourth post I've managed to catch (who knows if there are more) of someone dropping it before trying anything else or even considering that it was a visual bug.
---
The one you have will outdamage the one you want by a huge margin.
---
maybe if you could chose if you want to be notified if its a person or a mob, where my base is the only mob thats attacking my base is a tick... im not running home to kill a tick that got past my turrets lol but if a human is taking my base down because they dont like my prices i would love to be able to run back and take out a wanted player
---
Yes, animal friend rank 3. You need to find a random solo spawn that gives you the option to tame.
---
Haha my roommate had to get my attention one day, because some one was playing loud scratchy noises on their mic. She was like WTF, turn that shit down, I was just happily playing along, without a care lol
---
I do double custom fitted and I get so much further off the same AP. Reccomend 100%
---
cool thanks
---
how would you know if i did trade or put it in my chest it wouldn’t had done the same thing? i was in my private server so when i logged back it wasn’t on the floor so that’s 1 could’ve done the same thing if i put it in a chest or traded
---
Based on the "exclusion zone" for tent placement, I think the tent covers all the back spawns along the wall.  My personal experience is that an individual and stand in that same spot but the ring around them where enemies won't spawn is much smaller.  You'd need probably 2-3 people along the back wall to force them into the middle.  The problem with that would be those 2-3 people would miss out on the fun if not grouped....but good post (and considering trying this for the sweet sweet xp).
---
This quest stays uncompleted for me for those reasons. 
---
The Vox needs to be changed so that it does no damage. Game suggestion u/LadyDevann.
---
Isnt it super scenic where you are or at least directly near where you are?

Shaun is no match for him. Gg

I  just started having the same issue. Im a few quests away from ally.

But he tastes of chicken!

I have a JE RW Handmade and a JFFR RW Handmade. The JFFR is significantly better at killing anything and everything. Damage numbers are fucked in this game, I regularly do 2-3k damage per hit when it only says 160. DPS doesn’t mean jack shit when it’s not correct in game
---
Just buy some bulk and then farm with your weapons
---
I'm on PS4 😩
---
I'd just like it if we could craft legendaries of gear that isn't from Wastelanders. Would allow us to control the grind somewhat without really lessening the play time required that Bethesda's going for.
---
You... Monster! :'(
---
It's the Gauss Shotgun. Try holstering it and bringing it back out again, or change weapon and back.
---
You’ll say that until you’re carrying aluminum or Ballistic fiber
---
What platform?
---
First roll was a bffr so I scrip it because I couldn't sell it
---
Does this apply to 55% vats perk too?
---
Ahaha :D Scratchy noises :D
---
Couple weeks back i heard a very loud argument going on between a wife and a husband (i assume). Husband was playing and wife didn't like it. They didn't realize that they had their mic on. I gently said "excuse me, everyone can hear this..." and the wife yelled "FUCK YOOOOUUUU" and then there was a loud bang. And the mic went silent. 
---
Thats about the only thing i have heard this year :D
---
Would probably be divisive, since opinions on the alien stuff in Fallout differs quite a bit. Personally, I disliked whenever it became more than just an easter egg. It just pulls me out of my immersion. I like the grounded parts of the Fallout universe a lot more.
---
I asked a random Raider npc is she had anything other than ragstag and she gave me a cat steak. No cat has ever been safe since.
---
Well it is bloodied so someone would prolly want it so it would sell in your vendor but with the vats perks it's not a god roll weapon because vats isn't that useful on heavy weapons as it will go through your ap in a matter of a few shots. Check fed76.com for a price is what I usually do.
---
Lmao oh man, to be able to hear! I would've gotten a kick outta that lol
---
Does anyone actually use it as a main weapon? It just seems like a toy really. I never even payed attention to it because it’s just a blow dart gun.
---
Yeah, I know. I just like collecting BFFR heavy guns although I'm in no hurry. I just don't have much to use my scrip on. I'm a heavy gunner so I spend a lot of time in my power armor.
---
I have a few that are named after chess pieces as well rook, knight, pawn, queen &amp; king
---
Kill Super Mutants and Scrap their weapons!
---
Damn man id love to play with you, sadly im on XB. I generally barely ever use a mic anyways :)
---
Using the Scrapper perk after picking up whatever weapons a mob dropped (i.e. Bog Town has plenty of mutants with assault rifles/big guns) you’ll get plenty of steel
---
Edit: assuming you can kill them with a good melee weapon. Otherwise farm low level mobs (i.e. scorched around the Forest) to grab whatever lousy weapons they drop to scrap.
---
Ah yeah, I forgot about bulk from vendors!
---
I have had one where it spawned me inside of a rock. I couldn't leave, so I did dishes while I die in the flames since I was outside the circle. I ended up winning, and taking no fire damage.
---
Personally I’d get rid of lock and load, as 15% off such a long animation really doesn’t make that much of a difference in gameplay and can be used elsewhere.
---
Would recommend 3 points of Traveling Pharmacy and perhaps getting rid of bandolier for the damage boost in the HW perks? Found that Bando only gave me like 5lbs reduction when I started stashing my excess ammo.
---
In Intelligence I’d get rid of Power User as FCs are really easy to find and move those 3 points into agility for full Adrenaline + points of dodgy or Thru hiker if it’s a big boost in weight
---
Also for big fights sub in Tenderizer for travel agent as it’s nicey
---
Good build though!
---
You’re just ignorant then. You must’ve lived under a rock
---
Ill check it out
---
Usually works on the 2nd or 3rd try for me.  You must be camped in a popular spot.
---
Aww :( would have been an honour!
---
this is coming from a long time Fallout player, so dont think im coming for blood, but yo, youre basically paying triple for the same game, assuming you only pay for one year of fo1st. and keep it real, fo1st aint really that popping considering that only like $2 more gets you the Xbox gamepass, a library of hundreds of games. i *had* fo1st, but considering how unrefined fo76, i cant keep paying a premium for unpolished product. i mean, if im paying every month, shouldnt i just be able to pick up what i want in the atom shop? none of it can be traded or dropped. its mostly cosmetics. so i buy the game, pay for fo1st and if i blow through that 1600atms (approx one decent multi item pack) i gotta buy more. so you say dont get stuff in the atom shop, but  yo, to spend so much and still be so cut off from so much is pretty whack. if we all keep paying, Bethesda is only going to keep creeping closer and closer to EA turf. end of rant.
---
Just block the person who's at your spot.
---
Thanks!  I did try changing weapons but it did nothing.  I'll try holstering it next time (Hopefully never) LOL.
---
Ah boooo. I was going to offer 200 diffusers to you lol
---
Look for shopping baskets in the BoS vendor shop in Watoga and in the Whitesprings country club downstairs (there are also a ton of golf clubs there that scrap for steel). Any store should have some laying around, really.
---
Sure!  EST time zone, psn: The\_Grimbot
---
No mic here either :)
---
Equip the Scapper perk and kill all the super mutants at west tek for their guns, scrap them.
---
If you were on PC, I'd definitely play with you!
---
I also am a long-time solo player and hate forced PVP, so to avoid it, I just sucked it up and decided to pay for FO1st (since there's nothing better to do during quarantine!). My friends who join me on the private server are all very friendly and we all play strictly pacifist mode, and not all of us use mics. Also, in real life, I have tons of Deaf friends &amp; I sign, so you'd be very welcome in our gaming group!
---
I know it's unlikely, but if you ever switch over to PC, feel free to message me! :)
---
Apparently you're illiterate. I never said it affects world size. I said for what You want they'd have to either move existing quests from existing areas for the scope of what you want or expand the map for new areas to accommodate what you want. And I don't see either thing going to happen for something most players don't want to participate in. 😘
---
Cool, just interested to see the fix
---
My tent is by the crater and my camp is at whitesprings LOL.  I know.. I'm doomed.
---
Problem is, the game puts me back into the EXACT same server each time until I quit to the main menu and try again.
---
I see a lot of ppl saying they got bloodied or junkies so they scripped it. Why not experiment a little? Throw on Emergency Protocols for bloodied (and nerd rage if you have it), or down some chems for junkies. I accidentally ran junkies for like 50 levels.
---
Just finished the raiders this week and settlers last week have been grinding such wastelanders dropped
---
How did you figure that out?
---
all the items in the game require a code. so when you load in al lyour inventory is a code. so it knows you have what you have. each code is linked to a visual dat file. so you can see it and everyone else can see it. and everyone one every game has all those same fiels so no downloading is required this speeds up the process of you seeing what i have on. thus why sometimes people or places load in wierd. its the system processing the dat files locations. if you put in a custom image. everyone on that server will be forced to download that image. so when of if they walk by there it is. and you log off and the next time you play it has to do it again. incressing your game file size. and exposing you to possible hacked files. wich grants access into your system. and or leave illegal materials on your property. opp that pic of that dudes came had a underage girl in it. cops search your pc boom you now got kid porn on your pc welcome to a national database. i use extreme cases as an example. because that is what a company does when they try and figure out the possible risks to your safety and there's.  i would still rather have dogs playing poker paintings. for every 1 nice guy. their are 10 bad guys. whos sole joy in life is destroying something just so thy can say they did.
---
Interesting.  I assume I'd have to then hit "Find another world" again.
---
Was a joke...farming, easy, fun....this game? Nvm
---
CST timezone; Psn: Machaluchi
---
What level/build are you?  I'm currently 105 stealth rifle build
---
Bashing also seems to cancel it.
---
I’d be happy to play. What’s your level?
---
Its pretty common knowledge at this point. Speed Demon puts you at the max cap for movement speed. So any movement buffs are worthless if you're using it.
---
Thanks for all the suggestions, I guess I better go looking for stuff.
---
I'm pretty sure this is it. I was testing them all last night, kept getting the same problem. Was fun though! Magic weapons, Woop!
---
Ok, thank u . Got to start testing
---
that won't do anything other than make them not see you on the map. You can and will still end up on the same worlds as people you blocked.
---
Mics are so overated anyways.  Most parties I get into usually talk about everything but the game. I lose interest fast so I just tell people my mics broken or missing.
---
don't listen to them. Blocking won't do anything other than make them not see you on the map. You can and will still end up on the same worlds as people you blocked
---
I can't understand why Bethesda can't just make that one of the first checks when throwing you on a world. Camp can't be placed? Automatically jump to the next server and check again.
---
There is Skyrim PC|PS3|Xbox360|PS4|Xbox1|Switch vanilla|SE|VR to play.
---
Thanks pal! Your group of gamers sound really nice :) a nice switch up from all the other dinks on here lol
---
Dude, what platform? I got a few grand spare.
---
Okay, but when I tried, I was faster than a friend with speed demon while sneaking? Is there something else that could explain a difference in speed?
---
I want a return of how the Stun Baton worked.  In FO4, it had what felt like a 75% to completely paralyze an enemy for every single hit.  Which resulted in me having a ton of fun just meleeing the crap out of a paralyzed Deathclaw flopped over on the ground.  When your weapon consistently renders an enemy entirely incapable of fighting back, I don’t care how much damage the damn thing does it’s now the most OP weapon ever.
---
Nothing else was promised at any time that would warrant criticism right now. Saying things like "we want to add this some time in the future" is no guarantee, and anyone with the smallest amount of consumer awareness would have known what they were getting when they subbed (and frankly the sub is per month so it can be cancelled any time if a person doesn't like what's on offer). 
---
At the end of the day, yes it would be nice to hear updates on new features for the sub. Does that equal Bethesda lying? No, it doesn't, not at all, not even a little. And everyone getting upset based on that idea of them lying (in this context) is being a fool.
---
I'm a level 98, and I guess a melee build? I'm not sure lol
---
I'm gonna send you a friend request (GameDestroyer403)
---
Was your friend in power armor?
---
IKR!  but they are much MORE fun in rapid fire mode LOL.
---
I wouldn't mind crossplay between PS4 and Xbox but i don't want it with PC due to m&amp;k, increased fps, different settings and the hackers and modders.
---
Level 98! :)
---
Yea. The Behemoth lake is connected with an other one that is a few 100 meters hill upside. I placed it at the upper one where the hill starts to go down and build it over the small river. Bonus feature is when I sleep in my bed I can see the Whitespring when it gets nuked lol
---
thought they maxed at 3?
---
Good point. I admit I didn't research this thoroughly,but it seems logical for bugs to be animals,and lurks are crabs.Even scorchbeasts were proven animals iirc.
---
Sounds good pal! :)
---
You're welcome! We Vault Girls gotta look out for each other.  
---
Yes, our group is very nice, they're all my real life friends so they have to be, lol!
---
No he wasn’t
---
Awesome! Thanks for the help!
---
Bring that shit to me
---
I just hop in my power armor when I'm at camps that are on cliffs. I don't often see trap bases either, but when I do see them, they're super obvious and I avoid them. Only died to one of them and I ended up sending them a message congratulating them on being the first person to actually succeed in trapping me.
---
I dont know what level you are, but Uranium Fever is a fantastic way to farm steel. If a lot of ppl are there, dont look to kill the mole miners, just tag them. Wait until the event is over before looting. Also, there's a ton of mole miners in Welsh to kill. Make sure you have scraper equipped in either case.
---
Have both of you stow your weapons and try again.
---
Definitely the bumper sword. This weapon is just perfect for two handed melee users for sure especially for raider themed builds. This would be the icing on the cake
---
I've used the mic is broken line too, so people dont get pissy about me not being able to actually hear their problems lol
---
If you get on this evening I would appreciate one PSN; Insecuregoose
---
Have never been implemented into the game.
---
This, sir, is the enigma of the ages.
---
Psn messenger app for phone makes it super easy to chat if you didn’t already know!
---
I can’t tell, I’ll try it next time. Thanks!
---
If you're pressing the "find another world" button how do you know it's the same server?
---
Heads up that Deep Pocketed Limb mods are likely coming next week
---
Bozar! Powerful sniper build, let's go
---
Correct 3\* is max right now.
---
You betcha! Haha I'm pretty fast at replying, people just dont wanna type I guess 🤷‍♀️
---
No, you're thinking of "Block for Session".
---
My friends want me to play another game with them at the moment, but I'll play fallout later.
---
with trying to find rare items or spawns, server jumping its been my exp that there are usually 3 servers per region (may be more just what i have seen) if i change my vpn then i can get 3 more then change vpn again. but ya i think you need to find a less popular place for your camp. i had this problem when my house was south of top of the world.
---
I'm for sure going to be on tonight - I'll look to msg you.
---
Don't you like having more DR in ___ armor or making your enemies explode when wielding a ___ weapon?  
---
— *Half the legendary perks*
---
Bethesda has heard you and immediately implemented this feature upon your request.
---
HaHa definitely!
---
If I stay on the server after clicking "find another world" it is all the same camps and players.  I can keep alternating choices and still get the same result.  I have to exit to desktop and relog to fix it.  Then it almost always succeeds.
---
Prefer it oddly enough! I’ll be on later tonight but i’m online most days around 4:30pst for a few hours
---
Usually if I feel the need to server hop, it isn't going to wait. However, I do feel your frustration.
---
Last night I logged into a nuke zone, where it asked me if I wanted to find a different world.
---
I said yes and was promptly brought to the same world 3 times in a row, each time being asked if I wanted to switch worlds.
---
On the fourth world the area looked like it was still a nuke zone, but no pop up and not damage. Must have been a visual glitch that I've had a few times before.
---
But ya, was either super unlucky to have the same world picked 3 times in a row, or super unlucky that all worlds just happened to have a nuke dropped on whitespring. lol
---
If you go to West Tek Research and kill / loot everything (super mutants and junk), put on full set of unyielding armors, get yourself scrapper perk, get to low health (for as much in as possible) and scrap everything... You will get few hundred steel a run. Assault rifles especially give a ton of steel.
---
True! Im sure there are plenty of others on PS too that would!
---
I'd love the 12.7mm handgun and That Gun back
---
You're thinking of "Block for Session". I've tested it and it does seem to work, I've not been placed in the same world since I've been doing this. I'm using Block via the Xbox menu, not in-game.
---
Just add the mods you can get for PA lights but for the the pip boy
---
yea but its not as rampent as its hyped and also played should be given the ability to turn it off
---
I wouldnt do it. You can run BRC events over and over. The DC mask aint availible anymore
---
Lol so companies can say anything they want to sell products, and as long as they don't put a hard date on when certain features are coming, then it is completely okay for them to never deliver?
---
And no, the people who paid a year in advance can't unsub. But fuck them for believing what they were told in an official announcement?
---
I love this game as much as the next guy on this sub, but get fucking real dude. They advertised features to bait people and haven't said shit about it almost a full year later. It's not right and I legit do not understand wtf is going through people's heads defending these shitty practices. People are upset because they were enticed with what the service had in store and it wasn't delivered on, or even mentioned since. The only fools ITT are the ones defending that shit. How tf are you going to shit on people for wanting communication about a service that they are paying for?
---
Imagine actively supporting anti consumer practices
---
Brc event still available ?
---
btw im on pc and my brother is on xboxand we cant really buy him a hood computer
---
I think it might. Not 100% on that.
---
The value of the plans can only go down, the value of the masks can only go up. Take that how you will
---
Sounds good pal! Hope to play soon :)
---
CST. PSN: deadly\_pygmy  
---
In my experience, 95% of the people playing don't have a mic or it doesn't work... OK with PSN messages to concoct a plan (Playstation messenger on my phone works awesome). I am usually on an hour or two at night (8-10pm) and some weekends for a handful of hours. Always looking for stuff to do after the dailies are done! ha!
---
was on a private server with two homies and however long the nuke lasts we got over 10 \*\*\* enemies and a few that were less. not to mention the stuff to make the flux he needed. Overall yeah, seems pretty decent given RNGesus sides with you.
---
Yea, i run ridding shutgun like 3-4times a night . Just travel down to big bend east, talk to vinnie and start the event. If its not availible or you finish it, hop servers and chances are you can do it again.
---
Good info, I'll try the vpn change.
---
Pick up stuff and scrap it. The majority of junk gives steel.
---
I highly suggest that you move your camp to a less popular spot.
---
Oh god so perks+events are removed now untill at least pts 21,then it will be reintroduced in that pts,tested adn then released. So basically we can expect those two features not before august.
---
Ah I see thanks for the info, I guess this kid was trynna scam me.
---
You can craft the silent version. It gives me access to both, I just bought it
---
go to top of the world and take the guns from the scorched and scrap them, grab the can traps hanging around theres 3 at the main gate, 2 at the main house door, and 3 in the second house. go in the basement of the first house with the vendor ( if you have done the quest) and take all the coat hangers. 
---
scrap all this with the scraper perk. then fast travel to white springs and go in the main building and take all the coat hangers. first floor main entrance turn left and go to the coat racks there and take all the hangers. go down stairs and to the shops take all the baskets and coat hangers.  
---
this should help or atleast get you by. static items that spawn in the world for you reset after you loot 250 items so grab everything and scrap it all, either to bulk or store if you have f01st taking everything will make things respawn for you hope this helps
---
it's a fun toy.
---
go into a nuked zone, look for bloodied players (&lt;25% hp) and shoot them with the karma syringer. the next movement they make will be their last one (till they respawn ofc).
---
no nuked zone available? throw a nuka grenade.
---
Yea shoot me a friend request Space_ninja75
---
I've been looking for a group as well
---
You can get in at anytime
---
Actually, there is two choices. One to block for session. (hides player in server). Second block prevents join individual in same server. I accidentally block a player. They couldn't join my game.
---
I’ll try that thanks.  I put on a piece of blocking armor and I see the effect.  Wow.   Only if it would work consistently.
---
Wait! Theres guns other than bloodied handmades or fixers?!?!?  /s
---
I agree man. Each weapon should be viable on its own sense. It makes things more fun. And F the iTs NoT ReLiStIc argument. Nothing about 76 is realistic.
---
lol imagine if that was actually possible
---
Sure thing, watch out for a cutthroat_cass
---
For those who wear PA that works but
---
Well, if you have 50 saved levels its going to be more easy, make sure you have maxed out Perception and agility, my build was a mess but i managed to save it, equip rifleman, expert rifleman, master rifleman, focused fire, tenderizer, adrenaline, and bloody mess, if you have a bloodied fixer, equip nerd rage. Idk too much about junkie build so better look on youtube. Hope you can fix your build buddy. Mutations help you too, adrenal reaction, eagle eyes, bird bones, scaly skin etc
---
I meant like you can apply them to the pip boy
---
It's shame there's no way to advertise on the map what your store specializes in.
---
My current junkie character really just wants to run a drugstore. I'd love to have an 'Rx' on my camp's map symbol
---
Also a shame there's no practical way to run a restaurant that deals in perishable food&amp;drink.
---
Oic, I can't do that.  Console
---
HAHAHA no kidding.  Anything from the cryptids to alien blasters to carrying 3 suits of giant power armor in my pocket... it's ALL got roots in extreme weirdness.
---
These people saying the games to violent are probably the same people who take their 10 year olds hunting
---
The nuke keycard is required in order to  launch a nuclear missle.
---
Its a different from than the gov’t aid/supply request drop.
---
Given your word choice, you are not at the point to be able to launch; that said, the cards do have some value - a number of player buy them rather than hunt down and kill the cargobots that carries them.
---
How can you add PA light mods to a pipboy?
---
I dont really have much free time to even play games...so yeah, I'm pretty low level in fo76 (been playing since the day it came out and I'm level 39) but why does it suck? I have found plans for it recently and I was so excited to build it.
---
If you have everything and are at max caps with nothing else to buy why be greedy
---
No, I was saying that’s what they should do.
---
So we should not be opening perk packs, or does it not matter?
---
Works for computer but not consoles
---
You have some cards that you dont need on at all times. This is what i recommend using
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f265fb&amp;d=pd2pk2pp2pl2p02ek1c72ic4ar2an2ao0a04l71lt2lu2a30a51li2ck0s01&amp;m=051c24f3&amp;am=1027-132735-1327-1327-1327&amp;ad=0158a
---
Edit: Also, you should remove some of those mutations as some are not helpful for your build
---
I know sometimes they ragdoll away and disappear sometimes but my trick was pull out the camera until u see the name tag show up and sometimes that helps you find them
---
Truth is, if some of its utility aspects actually worked halfway well, it wouldn't be a useless thing.  The Endangerol Syringe, for example, would be a useful support option to tenderize tougher enemies.
---
We could use more things like that, honestly.  It's why I hope they never fix the current bug where Friendly Fire affects the Shishkebob.  Suddenly, the Shishkebob has value in events like Project Paradise, Radiation Rumble, or Riding Shotgun, and playing a support role where you heal the escorted NPCs is important.
---
Oh, most definitely
---
It's a skin you need to apply to existing armor
---
That's where I was able to find a few. But I've been mostly finding gold and iron. 1 black titanium ore per 10 iron ores.
---
Normally you add the skin to previously crafted pieces
---
The game isn’t too violent. Honestly if the kid can’t distinguish a satirical nuclear apocalypse from reality then that’s kinda an issue. 
---
I may be a member of the satirical r/banvideogames but I still support fallout, keep on rocking the wasteland
---
No, wont work. Its either or
---
lmao
---
Red wouldn't work for me but the benefit to pipboy light is it's omnidirectional not frontal cone.
---
My own personal modifications to the standard issue rifle build : https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2a648fb&amp;d=s01pd1pk1pl1pp2e92e42ic4l71lu2lt2la2a72ar2an2ao0c52cr0iq2au2ah0&amp;m=0c9863he4152fg7di&amp;ad=081a7
---
You wtf bro, that’s really uncalled for. Don’t bring negativity to this kind of activity. The idea sounds fantastic, and I’m very excited to see where he goes from this. If you don’t like it, fine, that’s you, but don’t be bashing on other people for enjoying what their doing. That’s a real reflection on who you are. Become a nicer, more open-minded person, for your sake
---
The mole miners drop junk that produces titanium when scrapped.  I think its the breather
---
The game desperately needs "sidegrades," I agree.
---
guess he wanted to say "the only two viable PA mods".
---
all 4 mods are useless without playing melee, playing melee in PA would attach one of these.
---
I'd love to see player faction battles added to the game. Or maybe a clan v clan system.
---
3* is max. On PC there are modded 5* legendarys that will most likely get you flagged and banned.
---
Ive been launching for a while, and imo, it is *only* worth nuking whitesprings if you're on a private world. 
---
Personally, I've rarely had a crash while relogging, but if I have to choose between risking a crash or guaranteeing assholes stealing legendaries... Ill take that risk.
---
Plus on private, you can repeatedly relog to immediately respawn every enemy as much as you want, so you're still going to end up better off than doing it in public, running it one time, and hoping the other people that show up know how to share.
---
Try to get all unyielding armor and go bloodied for max damage.start with buying a bloody handmade even 1* wil do and u 1 shot almost anything.if u want keep high health,build around the junkies handmade u got
---
Edit: and loose all the picklock perks and max rifle perks
---
Get into Uranium Fever.  Try and tag every mob.  At the end loot everything and put on the Scrapper perk.  Scrap everything right there.
---
Thanks OP, I've been placing my tent on the wrong side of the car.
---
I’m loving the sound of it :D I’ll definitely be watching your streams, and I’m excited to see where you go from here! I’ve recently joined the BoS: Operation hOpe4FUTURE, and I’m excited to see how we can all change the atmosphere of Fallout 76 into what it was always meant to be
---
I accidentally drank a Plague Walker serum I was going to sell.  
---
It has affected my life in no way. I've never seen it do anything, good or bad.
---
Don't open them. Save them for now.
---
Fatman and missle launchers that actually would do damage that matters.
---
I just wish there was a way to know what type (light, medium or heavy) your armor is in the first place lol.. it's so random..
---
Doesn't work for consoles
---
hell yeah!
---
1 is for melee, 3 are for unarmed.
---
My son is 9 and i just got him his own Xbox live account yesterday so he can play with me fun, memorable times. I'm level 147 he is level 5.
---
Hey just checking in wondering if you have it. Been server hoping Charleston Station, tried Tanagra and anchor farm these couple of days like kekcultivator and nerder suggested but still no luck...
---
I will, ty. Been thinking about playing that for a while.
---
Yeah no idea on the downvotes - but I tend to not shop hidden
---
You're welcome. Sorry to be a debbie downer about it, I just wish BGS would release more group focused content that actually necessitated diverse classes instead of just DPS.
---
Well, as a noob I have no clue what youre talking about with cargobots, but I got the US Supply thing and did the radio tower, but there was just no drop. I gave up
---
Any armor or does it have to be raider?
---
Yeah, as another user said, best thing to do is just deposit all junk before shopping. Statistically, you're not likely to run into a trap camper.
---
the assassin perk was created with the base game, back on release of Fallout  76 pvp was much difference. there weren't either a damage cap or lost caps for being killed.
---
Here is my build:
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f345fb&amp;d=sg2pd2pk2pp2pl2p02eh1ep0c72ic4a80a72an2ao0a03ar2l92l71lt2lu2](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f345fb&amp;d=sg2pd2pk2pp2pl2p02eh1ep0c72ic4a80a72an2ao0a03ar2l92l71lt2lu2) 
---
After if you want the best damage you are either going to want to go Instigating where you will oneshot most non boss mobs.  Junkies for steady damage increase per hit over the front loaded Instigating build or Bloodied which requires a lot of specific gear.
---
Wayward is just an introductory quest. You still have the primary Wastelanders quest which intermingles with some original beginning content.
---
I miss the thrill of fallout 4 when the world was so huge and unknown and exciting. I still adore that game but I log on now and just feel..meh
---
It should be every armor, but I'm not online to test it.
---
During the quarantine? The pandemic is still going strong 😂😂😂
---
If you're even remotely good you'll get a lot of salt to satisfy your appetite~
---
Griefing is still happening.
---
Nah, voiced protag wasn't a good idea in 4. It just reinforced how pushed on you the story was, takes away from rp. You were Nate/Nora regardless of if that was what you wanted for your character or not. One of the reasons many fallout fans regard new vegas as being the best modern iteration is the freedom for character depth and roleplay it offered, some of which is taken away with a voiced protag.
---
molemen, do the events in their mines... easily knock out 500-1000 if you tag everything, get an flame bow and shoot everything, let the other players kill em, there's always someone with their instagib guns killing everything, the flames spread and tag everything in range, get scrapper perk
---
thanks for the help i am just level 8
---
I passed the agility test at the end of her quest, no headache complaints.
---
Literally who the fuck cares. Stop being an oversensitive high and mighty bullshitter.
---
Scorchbeasts
---
Not *created* but they would be so rare that you would never see them, I see them every major event
---
You can kill it now?
---
I killed it accidentally once when I thought I had my camera out... oops...
---
Honestly after PA perks, I could care less about these perks needing to be all light/sturdy ect.
---
I don't care about the junk; I mean I don't need any more scrap and I never shop w/ flux and stuff.
---
But I am a camp critic. Put some effort into it!
---
yes. but two of these three mods of unarmed are useless, so no one mention them. 
---
what's your point here anyway? convincing someone that there are 4 mods, regarding that no one will ever use them on purpose? there are also alot of armor mods as example, but only the buttressed is worth to mention.
---
The 1911 you could get in NV.
---
Gotta say I hadn't checked Amazon in like 2 weeks and yeah they have some for retail but also some for like $500 don't be tricked!🤙
---
I upvoted yours
---
I still get players trashing my camp, bored I guess, and there is no bounty?
---
I have a few explosive gatling plasmas which fill that function for me with less weight and crafting cost. While I like many things about the gauss miniguns, I find them underwhelming overall for the cost of prime ammo. I would really like to see the Ultracite ammo weight changed to be the same as regular 2mm.
---
Looks like that way.  Meat Week is probably the same exact event like last year maybe with a few new rewards.  So that event will go live with a timer on the severs.  So between Wastelanders and Patch 21 no new events for about 4 1/2 to 5 months.  Jeez...
---
Yeah, punjis should be relegated to pest control. They should remove their ability to damage players.

You can choose other colors, too, but i can't look it up right now. I wear my hat for hundreds of hours now, can't 100% remember how to unlock the different colours but if i had to guess: i broke hats down to learn iirc. For me, the omnidirectional pip boy lightning always felt unimmersive. Used a headlight mod in fo4 and was more than happy when i found out hat mounted lights were a thing in fo76.
---
weeping angels .. nice
---
I'm kinda past the point where junk is important, certainly on my main. The only things I care about generally are the things for Stings/Things daily, flux and vault steel - and I nearly never shop with those in my inventory.
---
Yeah. I also love how VATS counts it as fully charged so you can just tap it instead of charging it.
---
While I don't think this game would benefit from another ammo type, I'd love to see the 45-70 guns added.
---
I'd especially love to blast things away with a Sequoia
---
"fun"fact: the junkjet was in the beta of Fallout 76 - some people still got one. bethesda cut them on one of the very first updates.
---
I had a kid offer me 2k caps last night for my deathclaw mask.  If I had an extra I would have just given it to him, but I only have one.  Felt bad but had to turn him away.
---
I'm running a tweaked bloody Turtle heavy gunner build out of power armor lol it's badass. Major damage and experience living on the edge. I will throw the excavator on sometimes but not wearing it is more fun, more XP. I have a bloodied 50 cal with faster fire rate, bloodied gaus shotgun, bloodied gaus minigun (sitting in the stash).
---
I have SS unyielding (buttressed, jet pack, armor-plated backpack) with a couple of magic rolls. I occasionally die but it isn't too bad, it's a super tanky build, love it. Thanks to Angry Turtle for creating all these ready to run builds...
---
There is ritual cloths that you can find in their camps
---
Closest you can get is the cultist outfit. Theres a full set in the hidden room at lucky hole mine.
---
Must remember this
---
If their allowed to have trap camps, ur just as allowed to sit there and warn people.
---
$#!@$ You should of replied an hour ago - already spent the gold!
---
I have Tesla's at my base, but not set up like a trap - more set up like a mad scientist lab. I mean, if you lay down in the cot after throwing the switch you're likely to die - so don't do that. But sometimes my ally lays in the cot, and I TOTALLY FRY THEM AND TAKE PICTURES.
---
But yeah, rarely see them at bases. Did see them at the kissing booth one I think.
---
I gotta do my part ya know?
---
Fucking awesome. I just recently started playing again and never made it far, about level 11 now with a new character with my little 3x3 wooden hut. Will have to look into this!
---
Didn’t know that, I’ll do some researching on that, thx for the info though.🤠
---
Mesmetron
---
There was alien content cut from the game. You had several branches of enimies too. Kinda like how you have wander, master, etc. Versions of super mutants and scortch, same was with aliens. I would not be surprised if they go and turn it into some kind of event or added thru a patch later.
---
Well hopefully with the new Destiny style season system. Introducing seasonal story quests to keep you playing plus the xp grind. They will get away from the rng BS.
---
Thank you!
---
I did not know that until this post.  Got to try it, thanx
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Junk\_Jet\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Junk_Jet_(Fallout_76))
---
And I don't mind when I do - if it's a cool trap.
---
But if it's low-effort and it works with the guy basically having to be in build mode - yeah ... up your game.
---
I don't use mics much either so I am fine with texting and emotes. ikki_makko
---
Yw!
---
Yeah, mutilation is not as bad as hearing the F-Word.
---
Sounds like you live exactly in the society you deserve.
---
You need to be at least double your desired tame's level.
---
Wait
---
Yeah its one reason why dmg is so high. Also works with the gauss pistol and I'd assume the rifle as well
---
I ought to have one.
---
You get/got notifications your when Camp was under attack by a Player. 
---
The notices stopped appearing as often  now that players can't just attack your stuff.
---
i would just fix all the ones we currently have.
---
If it instantly poofed after you placed it, it should be in your inventory.
---
It's a placement bug when there isn't enough space or something in the way but it lets you place it anyway. But it will insta-poof back into your bag.
---
Oh bummer! Good news is if you start saving from now you’ll be able to afford it by next Tuesday
---
No skin there for any armor
---
im a vanguard build so ofc my first roll for the gun was a bloodied explosive reduced weight.. scrip'ed second was a instigating faster fire less vats cost. im considering tossing it now because its crap and i dont need the weight lol 
---
wish we could sell them to ppl
---
KotOR II is almost unbelievably great
---
Ive been looking for a more stable group/people to play with too. My PSN is Foenix42. I'll be on later. I also have the app so Ill be able to communicate with you if you have it. Or I can send you a request. Either way lmk.
---
Oh I meant Black Titanium.
---
You can get SO much i zero time once you have the armour.
---
The excavator suit it perfectly useful for it's job with increased mining yield, increased carry weight and radiation protection. 
---
It's just not a combat armour.
---
The best place to search is NW of freddy fears up in the mire. There's a crashed vertibird in a pond that spawns random encounters and enemies.
---
Such a beautiful weapon
---
MOIST RADKELP
---
isnt there a rare actual alien spawn somewhere in this game? 
---
and yes i would love anything added as extra content. but what i really want is a map 2x the size as it is now, and 2x the # of players on it
---
Oh there is a ton left for you to do.try and make level 20 before you can finish the wastlanders story ..kind of
---
Events, quests, anywhere with super mutants
---
You wouldn’t happen to be playing in German, would you?
---
What armors are you trying to modify btw
---
Thank you for a more insightful load of information! Would the size of the images used (if there was a restriction on amount being able to be posted) cause a massive spike? Image sizes would be greatly reduced in regards to the sizes of the paintings, would they cause a noticeable amount of lag? I mean lag is already there, would it be noticeable if everyone had a 2-4 picture limit on what they had in their camp?
---
Edit: This all being hypothetical, disregarding any of the security concerns for now.
---
In my case the main room just has like 12 turrets from all sides so anyone who walks in gets shredded
---
The cultists outfit as others have said, and the pastors vestments.
---
Yup, it’s a outing getting the perfect legendary but is sturdy and not heavy.
---
Fellow female here! I actually posted a little while back looking for other female players to run around with. There are a lot of people who prefer a mic and even I added that as a preference but I also have 2 sisters with 80% decibel loss so I understand that there are some who need to use text instead of a mic. I’d love to join up with you. My psn is the same as my reddit name Th3L3tt3rA-A. I’ll send you a friend request and you can join me when I’m solo and me with my friends to be a team! I’m central time but I have friends in all different time zones.
---
The issue is that it just broke and their excuse was that I bought it a year ago
---
My kid played games like this at that age too and did just fine. Not all children are the same. Mine wasn’t afraid of anything and understood fake stuff in a video game is different from real life. People also assume children will “get” the adult humour and themes. They really don’t. It often goes right over their heads until they are older.
---
I can't imagine taking the time to set up a trap camp for how little people seem to visit. I want to actually play the game, not sit around waiting for people to visit. It's like waiting for a group to get ready for a dungeon in an mmo without the chatting. Just don't get it.
---
I play in german
---
I know what I’d do with this build.  Drop all the Rifleman and Archer perks.  Put in nine ranks of Comando.  Then drop Whitenight and install adrenaline.  As soon as you can drop Action Boy and replace it with a single piece of armor that has AP Regen on it.  
---
Now, put a Powerful Auto receiver on that handmade (and Fixer), and have fun!!!  Seriously, this is a good build....just needs tweaks.  Oh yeah, flush the mutations and get some serums.  Plenty of people like me giving them away in exchange for materials...you just have to ask.  
---
Adrenal Reaction, Bird Bones, Eagle Eyes, Grounded, Marsupial, Speed Demon, chameleon perhaps.  If you’re careful about which mutations you have, you can leave off Class Freak (replace it with Better Criticals or Four Leaf Clover, etc).
---
Nice! My psn is cutthroat_cass
---
Yes. I've lost 3 legendaries from disappearing corpses in the past few days alone. Very disheartening when it happens. Needs to be fixed.
---
Everything is already quick and easy in this game.
---
Fucking badass. Eat shit trolls!
---
Fallout without buggyness, nice meme. This will happen no matter what dev produces it. But yes they would most likely do a great job
---
🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
---
Its the outfit i believe.  Its not armor pieces if that’s what u assumed.
---
Yeah I always wondered about that, there clearly are 2 extra stars blacked out
---
Let's give a shot to Obsidian first ;)
---
Oh, raider stuff. Nice.
---
If possible, move it over to a mule character.  Three months from now you might be kicking yourself for dumping it.
---
1 of the 3 was a sentry bot
---
I did watch the video. All I'm saying is based on what I've tested, post-wastelands, this only affects laser weapons primarily. Which is why no one uses them outside of legacy variants. Perhaps he should do a post wastelanders video to bring more attention to the issue.
---
There's a bunch of iron veins on the cliffs near the bottom of the ski lift at top of the world. Use your excavator to dig them up. Should at least give you enough for ammo to hit West tek and Huntersville.
---
Try setting your language in English. I’m 99% sure that will work.
---
You don't understand, it has nothing to do with companies. When ANYBODY says "I might do this later" or "I'm looking into doing this later", this is no requirement that they actually do the thing. And there is certainly no lying involved if they don't do it. 
---
As far as the people who paid in advance, once again, if they had any consumer awareness they would have known when they paid that they might not get any of the things discussed in the one year period. So yea, the lesson is to read exactly what words are used before you buy something. I subbed for a few months because I knew, particularly given their track record, that the hopeful stuff for later wouldn't likely be in the game in one year. I used my brain and I read clearly. 
---
You describe it as "fuck them for believing what they were told", but the reality is actually "they must accept the consequences of their decision to buy into a product that gave no guarantees of specific features at specific times". They should have weighed that before making the purchase. 
---
You also have no idea if Bethesda advertised features to bait people. They may have started those things and failed to bring them to life for various reasons; they may still be working on those things. You can make a thousand assumptions to serve your narrative but it doesn't make your position any more factual or reasonable.
---
There are plenty of things to criticize Bethesda for, I do it often enough. But when someone is too inept to responsibly read marketing materials, that's their problem. And when they themselves lie by calling the company liars-- misrepresenting what was offered and what was delivered-- then those people are tools and I have no sympathy for them.
---
Will try, thank you for the fast reply
---
You know that almost nobody that worked on New Vegas is still there, right?
---
Cool I'll send you a request! Watchout for cutthroat_cass
---
I don’t blame you I do the same stuff when my wife gets trapped or anything like that. Last time it happened I just annoyed the person till they left launching mini nukes and throwing grenades and another time I nuked a person camp while they were fighting the queen so they didn’t notice when there camp was destroyed and I still made it in time to help finish the queen off
---
Do people forget how buggy New Vegas was at launch?
---
Have you tried the river right behind the Wayward for that problem?
---
Lol dude the only tool here is you. Have a good one. Keep defending those anti consumer practices and preying on ignorant consumers bud.
---
Also in response to "How tf are you going to shit on people for wanting communication about a service that they are paying for?"  I clearly wrote in my earlier reply that it's reasonable from my view to request updates about these features, and that the problem is when people make shit up or call Bethesda themselves liars on this point.
---
Get it straight.
---
I’ll just say as a 130 I’ve been wacked by my cousin that’s a level 43 just because he’s more clever than me.
---
Harper's Ferry Burrows - ghouls
---
Bozar, .233 Pistol (That Gun), Tesla Cannon or any of the Alien weapons from Fo3.
---
Pretty much just to add some variety, and they were some of my favourites over the series.
---
Check the link for the build. And finding a bloodied fixer is a doozie:P
---
Probably only because they were forced to use Bethesda's ass engine
---
Grab all the coat hangers inside Whitespring
---
Now I just need to wait about ~66 hours to see if redownloading it worked
---
I did not play it at launch and I have heard the same from Witcher3.
---
Probly not until a bigger update, maybe with the brotherhood but I wouldn’t hold your breathe
---
No it does not
---
“without buggyness”
---
Witcher 3 was buggier than a termite den at launch and for quite a few months after. 
---
As for everything else, it’s apples and oranges really. I honestly am not partial to being forced to play as a set character like CD Projekt games have been, and much prefer the breadth of options Bethesda creates for making multiple kinds of characters, living multiple kinds of lives. I want to live through a character in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, not watch a character’s story as they travel through it, and CD Projekt doesn’t provide that kind of experience thus far.
---
No it doesn’t
---
The messenger quest isn't quick.
---
LAWYERED!
---
Will do! Thanks for the reply!
---
A considered and convincing reply. Just remember not to let your imagination get carried away in a capitalist society.
---
Thanks for the build! As for the mutations I have to find someone with a lot of serums... It a take it or leave it deal when getting it for cheap.
---
Combat armor and raider armor but no skins/paint available in the list :(
---
No problem! Thanks for just adding me :))
---
You can find most of them in the Robco facility. Some of them are random and a couple are more rare than others. There are a few other spots that reliably spawn this junk item as mentioned by other posters. Just make sure you don't auto scrap before displaying them!
---
You might want to talk to a friend, family or a professional about this. Sounds like classic depression.
---
If it's just the Fallout franchise that makes you feel this way though, yeah, I feel you.
---
You should never have children, they would get bullied endlessly by the other kids because of how sheltered you would raise them and your kid wouldn't even understand what they did wrong because it would be your fault entirely
---
That’s a good point. But would probably incentives more people to subscribe to fallout 1st. Even if they’d have a wider selection available for fallout 1st and for a extended period of time.
---
Fucking bethesda... should say outfit in the pack not "waster armor"
---
Versus what? Spending time making a completely new engine that you Bethesda would claim as owning themselves, never use said engine again, *and* give themselves even less time to work on making the game than they already had?
---
I think they might have fixed a bug/exploit involving its charging, it's still amazing but not as OP as it is in Patch 19.
---
Looks like I’ll go shopping at the Whitespring.
---
Yes that's too easy though, I'm also looking for the rarer robot parts combination ones.
---
This would be an excellent addition. I honestly haven't even touched the camera since it came out until wastelanders, and once I maxed rep with both factions I stashed it once again. Outside that daily mission (or using it to scan for lost enemy corpses) it has virtually no purpose in the game.
---
My bad, rifleman is maxed.  What can I do to build further around the handmade junkies?
---
Fair enough
---
Get out of here. Bethesda is actually going to stick a deadline? Say it ain't so...
---
Bashing
---
Thanks. What can I do to max my 1 star junkies further?
---
Tattered Rags could work as well, though they aren't technically Mothman attire they fit the ragged and tattered look. But, as every other comment has said already, the cultist outfit in-game is your best bet.
---
I think somebody from Bethesda said in an interview that they were considering player guilds, so we can hope.
---
Sure I’d play I’m not very good though my psn is VinnySom850
---
This and a way to buy stars. Or reroll
---
Alwaus looking for new friends to play fallout with, ill shoot you a friend request a little later (gothamprotector_)
---
I said *want*, not *need*.  It's the armour for people who don't want to optimise.  I mean, judging by your extreme 1-shot capability, you certainly must have done, so why did you do that when you didn't *need* to?
---
After being a two account, every day player I haven't logged in to 76 in a week, except to claim my Smiley gold Saturday, and it's been so liberating.
---
I've always had a giant game backlog, games I never started or did but dropped after a period of time and then would have to start from scratch by the time I went back.
---
I finally reached the point where I realized that Bethesda's model of trying to FORCE us to login every day instead of it being fun to do so was a waste of my playtime.
---
The past week has been glorious playing offline games that have been sitting on my drive. 
---
Now Playing...Divinity 2.
---
Hey no problem if you aren't very good, I'm not either! Theres a reason I stay away from whitespring lol watch out for cutthroat_cass
---
I usually get stuck in tps aim mode and reload weapon helps.
---
Im aware its still around. I meant when we started having to stay inside.
---
Add me i’m always down to team up with others my psn is iiFR0STYYYx
---
The archer was a mistake, sorry. Its not really in there.  Commando eh? How do you keep up with the ammo usage?
---
Buggyness kept to a minimum I would say but yeah CDPR does and seems to appeal to a lot of people when it comes to what they might be able to achieve on fallout storywise. Knowing them they'd probably take inspiration from the first and second fallout story and build from there.  Probably hire the writers that worked on it. Idk but in some future, I hope that happens
---
He was at one of my benches and it wouldn't let me do anything. I ended up having to move my camp because I tried for about 5 minutes to scrap it while he walked around and used my benches.
---
so if you go into fats and use third person you would get the benefit of the faster fire rate as well correct?
---
I also dislike how the sights on a bow mean nothing
---
Quad crossbow entered the chat
---
Sweet! I'll shoot you a request right now :))
---
The hell? Haven't heard of that bug yet
---
That’s funny, because I have kids and the other parents have complained that my kids are playing “violent” video games.
---
40 scrip
---
Chinese Assault Rifle. Yeah I know we have the Handmade, but it's just not the same. I loved the Aesthetic and sound of firing it every time some raider goon tried to mug me.
---
itll seem slow no matter what but its pretty fast, esp if you donate your rewards
---
I play with my Friend and his Girlfriend. I’m in Central time and they’re Eastern time so they’re an hour ahead of me. 
---
My PSN is Zer0_Sk1ll_F0und if you’re interested
---
Watchout for cutthroat_cass :))
---
https://fed76.info/weapons/
---
Check pricing here
---
It's not armor, just an outfit. The torso part does resemble the raider armor torso though. Really it's pretty much a recolor of what Gage wears in FO4.
---
Ah thanks
---
Or load em all into the new scrip-jet! It shoots rainbows!
---
holy sweet lord tundern jesus b'ye. obviously your a bloodied build, but what kinda perks are you using to get that high of a hit? my highest hit ever was 300 with my shotgun while sneaking, average is in the low to mid 100's
---
Np!  I don't know anything about Junkies build.  Sorry.  I mostly play Instigating and just now started dipping my toes into Bloodied.
---
I would try to play other games, Terraria had Journey's End drop a week or two ago (I can't tell time anymore) and the Nether Update rolled out yesterday. Sea of Thieves also got some cool knew content.
---
I bought some last night i don't think this is a problem on xbox!
---
I like first person:(
---
I've never played on anything but public servers, and have found the griefers are few and far between.  Most people are so busy doing their own thing they just run right by you.
---
Vault steel won’t drop if you are killed by a trap house.  I know this all to well unfortunately.  Haha.
---
Must remember that one, thanks!
---
Everyone wants explosive. Without it being bloodied even with broken perks will be a hard sale.
---
Ok sounds good!
---
Might be this whole mess.
---
hey, i haven't played much in a while but when i do i never use a mic either, and i've been hoping to meet people to play with who don't want to voice chat/aren't teenage boys yelling slurs
---
psn- deluxe-truant
---
Heh, I saw medic limb DMG minugun killing queen in 5 seconds. This kind of viable did you mean? ;)
---
They should word the packs properly..
---
Put him on Falliut 4, so sick of these little crotch fruits on voice chat in my events.
---
The PTS is open to every single PC player. You don’t think that’s enough people to test?
---
Which reward do u think is better?
---
I would never have to craft ammo just because I find so much
---
I dont really carry much chems or food. Usually first thing I do when I get on is make cranberry relish for the 10%xp boost, and then just grab it as I need it, or will throw on cannibal perk and eat on the go. With chems I try to carry as little as possible. Usually 1 or 2 psycho buff, a few diluted radaway, and maybe 10 max stimpaks, though I rarely need it, since I have the healing perk. I've been thinking about just ditching traveling pharmacy altogether. 
---
Could get rid of lock and load for more damage. I have a metric shit ton of ultracite plasma cores and fusion cores in my inventory. I was using a gatling plasma before I got the bloodies minigun, and now I need to offload that somewhere. I'm probably going to get dodgy so I need to move some points still. Wish they would give us a few more special points before locking them.
---
I did a test earlier ago and found that my bffr gatling plasma was doing  less damage than my bffr lmg although the plasma has higher pipboy damage. I'll do more formal testing to confim this, but I'm still not convinced that the plasma guns are working right.
---
Bloodied unarmed, high strength, twisted muscle mutations, bobblehead s and magazines, bunch of food, chem, and alcohol buffs.
---
Actually you will still be able to with workshops. But that's good where it is , the changes coming have been needed honestly, definitely not always in the mood for a fight when friends might be, so being able to opt out completely like we will is good as far as I'm concerned.
---
Hey I'm always down for a quiet game lol 
---
Psn Cutthroat_cass
---
Yeah I don't get it. I  got a decent Anti-Armour-limb damage, and with all the shotgun perks, bloody mess and a level 4 demolitions expert it tops out at 675 per shot with mods. Yet somehow a 206 dmg 1\* instigating combat shotgun outperforms it?? That's 412 damage a shot, 200+ lower than my Gauss and even if I max charge it it struggles to 1-tap anything. 
---
This doesn't make sense and I feel like somewhere something is wrong with how it applies damage. It's listed as an "energy weapon" so I'm thinking maybe it suffers from the same issues other energy weapons (laser-plasma) have? Just a throw away thought, somebody who knows more about the issues/bugs with energy weapons will probably explain it better.
---
oh THAT's what made them spawn inside the fortification! I thought last time I was at the event it was just another spawn bug that made them spawn there
---
Those aren’t meta 2nd and 3rd effects, but they aren’t bad either.  The LMG is never a Vats gun, but vats is still handy when you just need to pop a couple head shots or Sting Wings at Scorched Earth.  Also, the LMG lends itself to Ultracite ammo...much more efficient to make in .308
---
I learned after dumping a ton of good weapons and armor.   A few months from now you may find yourself working on a bloodied heavy build....and wishing you still had this one!!
---
Yeah thats all I ever use is 3rd person. Idk what it is about this game but ive played video games for over 20 years and this is the only game that I've ever gotten motion sickness from if I play in first person.
---
Great rolls on the wrong gun. You wanna avoid vats perks on heavies , usually to fully perk into heavies you run stabilized but using vats in pa drains the fusion cores quick. The LMG has the most drain of fusion core when you use vats with it. But these exact rolls are great on rifles and pistols. You wanna look into like B25 BE or B10 rolls into heavies.
---
Between the stealth suit and the plasma rifle? The stealth suit, it works like an armoured hazmat suit. You can get both though like I said, do the foundation missions up to the siding with foundation one, then switch over to the raider missions and do those, be kind to ra-ra during her mission and then assualt the vault with the raiders, when you get to the part where you can optionally get ra-ra to open a door, do so and you'll find the rifle.
---
btw, a suppressor's 2515r GP is not worth 6k caps, let alone 13k. put it up for sale on your vendor for 2.5k and maybe some sucker will bite.
---
otherwise, like mr. Bundy said, just scrip it. it's a shame, but it's also a suppressor's.
---
You can get a fresh set from the Pool Table, 4th Floor, Fort Defiance.
---
The Gauss pistol was actually better because it required one less action point to fire.
---
They really should. Newer stuff tends to be a bit better, but anything that's older and brought back keeps the vague description it had initially. I remember some of the early PA skins didn't even tell you what PA they'd work on.
---
Someone tried to grief me earlier and harassed me, trying to get me to come back and fight him/her and 4 other people. You shoot first, I ended it, I went back to vendor hopping.
---
So u can get the Chinese stealth suit and the rifle at the same time?
---
i wish that if bethesda insists on different variations on their armor to just give them entirely different names like how diablo 2 had variations on each armor and weapon for each difficulty like Quilted Armor &gt; Ghost Armor &gt; Dusk Shroud  
---
Metal becomes Scrap &gt; Metal  &gt; Alloy  
---
Combat becomes Rev 1 &gt; Rev 2 &gt; Rev 3  
---
Leather becomes Hide &gt; Leather &gt; Refined  
---
I dunno about the names honestly...it's just an idea, but if the armor is meaningfully different enough to not switch armor style, then give them different names and/or default coloring to annotate that difference...i'd honestly love to be able to change the armor style but they would have done it by now if they were interested...
---
I quite enjoyed TOW when it came out, whilst I was taking a quick break from FO76. I should take another break soon, maybe when Ghost of Tsushima drops. Mind you I’ve still got RDR2 mostly unplayed...
---
They on PTS? They said today that the build that goes live today is basically what they will be using on live
---
Yep if you do what I said, you'll be fine. If you just side with foundation though you will lock yourself out of getting the rifle, so don't run that mission and you'll be okay.
---
Thanks a lot!!
---
Damn, so close!! Thanks for the reply!
---
Bloodied 50 limb with rw and vampires 50 limb with fmswa
---
No problem mate.
---
you can do what i do, throw it on a mule, rename it be '(investment) supp gat plas' and hope bethesda gives you an inch over the next few years.
---
Anytime
---
Would be nice if some content would not be pushed forward...pathetic
---
Honestly at this point the only thing I’m doing in 76 is getting caps so I can waste it all on workshop plans so I can make a welcome to 76 vase for new players
---
Bro I’m in the same boat as you are. I’ve loved this game so far and maybe the negative stigma is because of how bad a taste it left in everyone’s mouth after release, but dammit if I haven’t had a hell of a time rediscovering it two years later. 
---
P.S. Coming from a similar build it makes the game so much fun because you can play solo or in a squad. No limitations my man
---
This is literally me almost every day.
---
We're getting the BoS teaser with this patch...
---
Naa, im just tired of server disconects, and grinding events for people joining for 1 second and getting better rewards than the one that grinded it
---
THIS
---
The hunter prefix doesn't affect mirelurks.

Soon(tm)

I honestly didn't realize it was heavier! As for legacy guns, I started a few weeks before wastelanders dropped, so I missed out on the explosive Gatling plasma craze. I would trade a full set of rare fasnacht masks for a legacy Gatling plasma, but alas, I have never seen an offer.
---
No, they’re the ones who use Purell on everything
---
It's an awesome little indicator to let you know when you should definitely scrip an item.  Along with Nocturnal, Bolstering, etc.
---
Ammo consumption seems daunting at first.  But you’ll find you’re moving so much faster it becomes worth it.  I use bloodied, so my ammo is even more efficient.  
---
Before I had Fallout First this was my ammo route.   Collect lead ore at Lucky Hole mine and store it in my stash.  Get acid by server hopping the three Snally Gasters at Toxic Larry’s.  Run through WesTek and gather all the guns...scrap them using Scrapper (still at WesTek.) Note how much steal this produced, you’ll need half that much lead.  Find a chemistry bench inside to smelt the lead, then go to the tinker workbench in the wharehouse section to make the ammo.  This system keeps from having to store tons of steal or iron ore.  
---
If you have First, it’s a bit easier, LoL.
---
Are you a bloodied pa user or you running a full health build ?
---
Well put.  For now, get a piece of blocking damage armor and don’t change in vats.   Just vats and fire.  It works better than I imagined.  Still a little bit of hit and miss but much better.
---
Damn thats a good idea, I should get an explosive stash just for when people try to steal from me 😂🤔
---
My PSN is ZLS-Kowalski. I’ll send you a friend request when I get on.
---
My main is running a fully specialized bow build with 12 perception perks thrown at it ever since I hit level 50 (currently lvl 90). No Mr. Sandman, though. [Like this](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/ladydeath/) \- just replace the four Rifle related cards with Bow/Crossbow related cards.
---
The stupid 95%-hit-chance-misses are unnerving, but when it happens, I just release the VATs lock and acquire the target again. That seems to reset it. Eventually you get a feel for when it happens and can work around it. 
---
What speaks for the bow? Your mileage might wary, but I find it oddles of fun to sneak around doing vasts amounts of damage in single shots over considerable distances. The highest damage I got against a super-mutant with a single head-shot at about max range was 3766 damage. 3-star legendary bow (+50% limb damage, additional damage on first hit and faster VATs recharge) plus plasma-arrows. So about every third target drops nuclear material as well. This drops anything but boss-level monsters with one hit - even center of torso. Level +80 Snallygasters or alike take 2-3 arrows - perhaps four at the most.
---
Even the non-legendary run-of-the-mill glow-sighted plasma bow usually does 500-1200 damage per sneak-shot with that build. 
---
And if there are mobs up close and rushing or queen fights? A backup weapon such as a bloodied fixer, a LMG or submachine gun can handle that.
---
There is zero reason to believe it is a paid system. It is entirely free, and if you're unable to complete the events within the window, you have the OPTION to purchase the progress. But yes, if you play a decent amount, you don't have to spend a penny.
---
Not when it’s suppressors

Have someone craft you the Brotherhood Recon Rifle

not yet, a few of the upcoming legendary perks will require a set bonus of the armor type Light &gt; Medium &gt; Heavy
---
Hmmmm.....I believe Stilt Bean gives you Cobalt Flux. There are a few of them around the Bog, I just can't remember where (maybe up near Lucky Hole?)
---
Sweet! I'll be waiting for it :)) ... that wasnt suppose to sound creepy lol

Kinda hard with the pandemic and all that in some places

Assassin's weapons = scrip.

Been playing Pokemon Go recently, it's a nice break from at home games. Competing locally for some of the Gyms where I live gets interesting lol.
---
Fallout Snap
---
I loved Pokémon Snap and am stoked that the sequel is coming out! But this would be sweet.
---
I only use the Deluxe to find lost lootable corpses these days...and the occasional keepsake photo, of course.
---
I’m somewhat surprised that I’m still playing FO76 (with only a small gap for The Outer Worlds). Usually I’d have long burnt myself out on a single game by now. Actually there have been times my PS4 has literally gathering dust for months, whilst I may have been getting some sort of weird strategy/sim fix on my Mac.
---
Aside from grinding for bullion I’m in a bit of a holding pattern now (though as of late have done a bit of flux farming and serum stuff). Maybe I should take a quick break before seasons start?
---
The deliverer, cause I love the Walther ppk/s
---
Same issues with the Gauss rifle. 
---
Can you also charge the hell out of shot and only do about 1/5 of the damage of an uncharged hit? Because the rifles do that too.
---
All good mate!!
---
Yes we are, Jeff Gardiner (Project Lead) confirmed it:

I'm trying this approach this year so far and I'm liking it. I used to put in 100 hours straight and get burned out. Never to play it again. But this whole switching it every day or so has made it more enjoyable for me.
---
These posts honestly feel like astroturfing
---
Just double checked and the only mods added in the recent build are the under armor lining for some reason? Even though it was no DP was deemed a bug
---
I got a Bloodied, 10% dmg while aiming, reduced weight on my 40th roll.
---
I thought it wouldn’t been a more power story telling device if we would’ve traced her holotapes back to her bleached skeleton.
---
&gt;mass killing without purpose like any other fps game.
---
That's literally how this game is designed
---
You get the odd tosser here and there but it's easily rectified by blocking them from session and fast traveling.
---
I'm EST but typically play till 11ish when I'm on.  I hate using a mic so chat is definitely preferred :).  I do suck though, so there's that...
---
psn: tapperthegr8
---
When did you start, I ask because I play in front of my three month old and I have no idea when the begin to comprehend things and I don't want her to be scared or something.
---
Mmmh, 5mn isn't quick? 
---
I hope you can last longer for other... thing ;)
---
We can suck together lol I am... okish haha
---
Really can't believe people don't want vampire  legendary. It's like being invincible, as long you have bullets-, lol
---
hope you find someone! "sadly" i play on pc
---
Properly placed WS nuke will get you them all, noting that the snap tails don’t always turn to violet even when they are well within the nuke zone.
---
There’s very little cobalt in the bog unless you nuke the general’s
---
Sounds like he already is if he killed the lvl 24 twice
---
This happens to me often. I've even had it where I've placed several suits down.. they will eventually render but it's a visual glitch, and just on your end.
---
It seems so.
---
that worked like walked around on its own lol
---
Or maybe they noticed that a player is literally standing in front of their ammo generator that they leave open for everyone and just taking it all for a half hour... Or that a player is AFK on their porch...
---
I got my main answer but to clarify, The plan is full health. I understand bloodied but cant get myself to do it.
---
Shut up and take my money!!!
---
Thanks pal! If I get in on pc, at least I'll have a few pals from this post to add :))
---
Ps4!?!?! BOOOO! Why use consoles when there are PC's in the world lol. That's gotta be a challenge finding people. Awesome that you popped in over here to let us know! Never be shy to post over here. For me and I'd assume most people here, it's players like you who make the FO76 community awesome.
---
Because it’s legacy and that’s what people want.
---
Angry turtle recently posted a YouTube video about how respawning works. I’m gunna have to rewatch it a few times to fully grasp it all, but the spawns are on a ten min cool down. If you have a friend spawn in on your private server on the golf club they will respawn without you having to wait the 10 min, BUT if you are still at the golf club when they do load on it will only work if you are crouching. If you are standing you block the spawn for both of you and now you both have to wait 10 min. Something like that.
---
I feel like you’re just burnt out, when I got 76 I couldn’t stop playing it and then I just suddenly didn’t want to anymore (much to the behest of my entire family who got it just to play with me) but after giving it a break for awhile I can play it again as long as I don’t play it too much and burn myself out of it again
---
However you can tame a mirelurk king or hunter with animal friend....
---
Yeah, we all need a Mad Martigan tree at our camp
---
I know :(( pc is where it's at! I'm just a broke ass lol
---
Same. I would also never finish games because of this.
---
For me it also helps to have a variety of types of games. Sometimes I want to get on and not think, just release some steam and shoot anything that moves. Other times I feel like just escaping the real world to a more relaxing virtual one.
---
The run part sure... but reading books and learning something new are pretty pandemic friendly.

For sure just reply to this. havnt played in a few weeks but only because i didnt have a good reason (as in someone to play with) 
---
also i work with hearing impaired and deaf people so this was really nice to see somehow. and tbh. i know loads of non-english-native people that would much rather type than talk :P (like myself)

take a look under :

and delete all  2 or 3 gamefiles, the game create new files at next start

I also play in english cuz the translate of the voicelines is rly bad\^\^

I always seem to be short of stingwing barbs and bloatfly glands; I never have a problem with the other stuff. Only the radroach meat is perishable, and that's easy as there is a radroach which hangs about above the doorway inside the locked room in Dolly Sods itself.

The legendary modules should be used to craft all items now so least you have a chance of getting what you want.
---
Sweet! I'll send you an request :)
---
So what IS coming in patch 20, then? Just the Seasons?
---
Meat week up in ya face killah
---
Try the plasma arrows. They don't necessarily alert other enemies to your presence, do slightly more damage (+20 plasma damage instead of +15 explosive) and gooified enemies drop nuclear material as well.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Wow, thank you for these links!!
---
It kind of just happened. I found the right legendary rifle by chance.
---
No problem bud!
---
The second type of trap base is the ones I like finding..
---
The main reason is, I can't prove it yet but I believe there's a way to beat them I meed to find more trap bases. The reason why I'm holding out on how is becouse each time I've done it, it was a 50/50 chance I would servive
---
Well full health is good , but bloodied is leagues better only cause of emergency protocols , couple that with Blocker and you're Godlike. I have 1800 hours  in this game and most of it was spent on playing as melee and heavy gunner.
---
Ok. nobody seems to Nuke there. And I don't have the time or the resources to launch one myself at the moment.
---
The Gorge Workshop had a black titanium node you can put an extractor on, and it's pretty much the lowest level workshop there is.
---
Yeah, same here.
---
Gotta use melee for awhile and scrap weapons and armour you loot off the bodies.
---
That sounds fair! I second that. :p
---
I'd settle for quad-plasma arrows, though. Legolas-on-the-Olifant style.
---
Okay, I will serve her house a few times and see if anybody has nuked white springs. I honestly have not seen that place nuked in probably about a month of me playing. Everybody is launching them to fissure site prime in the bog
---
1500 is my bottom price on any three star. This is a basic 3star and sell it, unless you have mods, that will make it badass, otherwise I'd sell it.
---
You guys to lazy
---
tell me about it, level 608 and the grind is going to be real, I'd opened all perk packs until a couple of weeks ago and am realizing that its going to take me far more XP to get the equivalent perk points than it would if I were 400 levels lower and starting this grind...

Install the perk loadout mod. You will be able to change an entire build quicker than changing a single perk card.

It doesn't?  That's so stupid!
---
I've only used them in nw, so I was stuck with explosive, but I'll check it out
---
Nuke Morgantown. Why are you limiting yourself to the bog? Is it because you don’t want to launch a nuke yourself? Get some good melee gear and blast trough a silo.
---
It seems to expire after a time. Obnoxiously, you need to kill the app and restart it, sign in within the app and you can start the game without issue
---
Dude, I love Fallout.  Love it to death.  But I'm taking a break, and that's okay.
---
I'm on xbox so it's moot but I would happily group with you.

Hey guys! Thank you all so much for the support and new friendships, my internet is really really slow, but I promise I'm trying to add all yall... if you dont see my request, send me one!

Nuke whitesprings stand at train station on right hand side of the estate on the trees the sticky goo nukes to blue cobalt there are few trees with it on
---
Even using your camera sometimes it’s beyond difficult to find them. The ability to have them either be auto added to your inventory or at least be somehow highlighted in the world to make them easier to find are mechanics worthy of being a legendary perk card at the very least (way better than the current ones), or just a given mechanic in the game. Wasn’t there something like this in fo4? Or am I remembering a mod?
---
I agree. I'm a casual gamer, (maybe 3 times a week for a few hours). I feel like these posts we see are from people who have time to just dump 6/8hrs a day on the game since release. They have literally grinded the game so hard and done everything. I've seen these people in other various mmos I've played in the past. While I am over here looking at the mass amount of things I still need to do to keep up with the new events/updates coming out. While I have no negative feelings towards these people, I feel as though some of this community has never played an mmo before. I see the words "micromanagement 76" a lot...like for real? Did none of you play fallout 4? Go try playing an actual mmo and then complain to me about micromanagement, cause you wont. Anyways, I'm still enjoying it and glad you are too!!
---
I never tried NW and doesnt want to, because i know its  pvp. (Have now 300H in 76)
---
With PVP on „survival“-servers i agree, but only if i can choose that im ready for it otherwise it will be totally disabled.
---
I'm Outdated_Meme123, haven't played in a couple of days, but I'm getting bored of playing alone anyway, and don't have a mic!
---
Idk about workshops but i know in the house in the repair yard place near watoga has one
---
My kid (2) watches me play stuff and I’ve let him have a broken controller to mess with. He’s recently started sitting on my lap and moving my thumb. I just avoid playing horror games or anything super graphic on front of him and I’d like to think I’m not a terrible parent lol.
---
i like it too but damage over time is annoying
---
YK42B pulse rifle and YK32 Pulse Pistol from Fallout 2. Oh and an Alien Blaster that doesn't suck and the H&amp;K G11E was cool. Hey remember when the powerfist used fusion cells? /sigh
---
That hidden door is very nice.
---
Shortcut to stop that is start running, you’ll stop reloading . Bad part is this only works half the time, it’ll just reload without the animation.
---
Yes you can
---
I was 7 when resident evil 1 came out. Played the heck out of that game as a kid. 
---
You are doing nothing wrong my man hope you guys continue to enjoy the game!!
---
That is interesting, I'll go watch his video, thanks for the heads up. I do have a second account with a mule but have been unable to join it as a team during these runs which is another problem altogether, the Join and /or Invite heading just not there.
---
Would be nice as an actual fireplace, but I suppose you can put it on a door wall, replace the door wall into a normal wall and lock it.
---
You want to play Nuclear Winter right ?
---
Well, it's bugged. You have to play in English to play a match...
---
That makes sense, FO76 isn't really intense the way a resident evil game can be. Thanks!
---
I have plague walker. Always have pacifist mode on. Sometimes I get whacked by a player and here it proc, but it has never initiated pvp for me.
---
That's why I paint minis. I can still get my Fallout itch and not have to play something I've played a dozen times over.
---
Don’t touch the joy stick and it doesn’t trigger.  Once I learned this and slowed down, I haven’t had it happen since.
---
One of the Bots in Whitesprings sells it. Just bought it about 2 weeks ago.
---
Anyone can access the private server if they have fallout 76, which works through game share. But if you can't log into the private server on your own or have the new camp or stash box she doesn't have fallout 1st subscription applied to her account or console
---
Huh?
---
Also the train yard north east ish from the Whitesprings has a building with several safes.
---
Follow the tracks north and it should be the first or second big building on your left.
---
 The back wall(furthest from tracks) is blown out and is where you enter.
---
I'm not going to give up just yet, but being unable to jump world instance because of this error is pretty frustrating when I read of so many people doing just that to farm glowing ghouls and flux from nukes.
---
Hope it is just a glitch, my internet is pretty stable.
---
Not sure your platform, but that’s common for me on Xbox. I play with my husband. Sometimes to get on a team we have to restart the game and if that doesn’t work one or both of us do a hard reset. Then we can team up or join each other’s server.
---
Sadly the masks aren't that valuable because of the number of people that did the event and duping. I've found several in vending machines. Explosive energy weapons are pretty fun. If you can find one for a reasonable trade go for it.
---
There is a set of cultist robes in the basement of the Mothman museum in Point Pleasant.  A headpiece too I believe.
---
Yeah :P I have so little to do in the game now I dont know if its worth it...
---
I had to make them for this person but I think it was worth it he messaged me like 5 times telling me I’m worthless and I should get a life 😂
---
Hey, im on ps4 and usually play alone. Im down to play with u anytime. My psn is the same as my username here. Feel free to add me
---
Fantastic bonding opportunity! Thanks for sharing. Keep waxing trolls!
---
I'm sorry, it's a cruel world out there 😿
---
I’ve recently started to do some flux farming. General’s Steakhouse for violet, Morgantown for cobalt and Whitespring for the rest and the other crafting materials (plus some cobalt and a single violet).
---
I made this post before I knew the pass was free. Yeah, you are right. It’s free. I’m just worried about how much I’ll have to play. I don’t play every day. I love the game, but I hate the pressure.
---
Only games where there’s a chance of getting my ass kicked truly keep me engaged now. That being said I’ve been playing 76 for about a month and haven’t quite burnt myself out yet. Although logging in just to do dailies is beginning to get to me...
---
For sure man :)) if you see cutthroat_cass pop up, that's meeee
---
Blocker - that is a hugely underrated perk would suggest swapping that in if you can as it makes the Yao Gui's and SBQ's melee attacks much easier to shrug off- ideally you can reduce the number of heavy guns carried and drop bear arms and get that in and you'll me even more tanky than you already are with this build
---
when i find another world it works for me
---
Morgantown
---
I have a bunch of combat armor, and a single leg with cloak, a bunch of agility, and the Escape Artist and Sneak Perks. I can basically crouchwalk anywhere I want, attack things multiple times and they still can't see me. It's nuts. That sneak attack damage plus instigating and 40% power attack damage to the face just instagibs things. That's well before the rest of the unyielding or nerd rage kicks in.
---
go to ash heap
---
I'd love to have the death effects of the original games in the new ones like lasers cutting the enemy in half and plasma guns actually melting flesh, not just leaving puddles.
---
specially on pc when youre already using a keyboard.
---
You should look up how to farm lead it's not that hard honestly
---
I think it used to but only when other players attacked it
---
Damn, forgot to type that, on PC, it's as if the time is takes to run the silo as I'm not fast yet and the nuke itself stressed the world instance I'm on and makes things get weird.
---
Will keep trying.
---
I was hoping the legendary effects would help buff a lot of these weapons.  Here is one of my favorite ideas!
---
\-Master Chef: Crafted food lasts twice as long and requires less ingredients to craft. Rolling pins deal 30pct more damage.
---
Stuff like this would make so many of the old weapons and legendary effects so much better.  Zany but useful, that's what I want from FO76 legendary perks.
---
the Debug Megapistol.
---
I guess you could get it in NV.
---
Just want to see what it would be like
---
I mean, presumably you also specced into a stealth build, and gathered appropriate armor and mods too.  It's not hard to do a spot of optimisation, so why not?
---
That said, at the moment the legendary prefix is more important than the armor type, but maybe not for long.
---
Its funny, because ive never seen them alive and thought it was normal that this little cat is dead. Its Cheswick MLXI now?
---
Psn - jrey-nativepride I play with ya bud

I haven't been feeling the itch for almost a month now. I've just been watching anime and reading fiction online. I have to admit, I've been playing PSO2 on the side as well but not at the same fervor as when I just got 76 a few months back.
---
Well, at least I've still got the Wastelanders content to look forward to and the upcoming BoS expansion when I get around to playing again.

Good to hear.

---
Do a search for junkie build on this subreddit. There are some great ones!
---
How much was it?
---
Exactly this.  The blueprinted punji board box that gets placed on you when you're standing there browsing their vendor is unacceptable.  It's not a legitimate trap nor is it even PvP.  It's just a scumbag move.
---
There is exactly one plant that i know of that gives cobalt in the area where Queen is (close to the fortification/wall in Forward Station Delta). Whitesprings has lots of it.
---
We were wondering the same thing as well and we found 1 spot, this confined it but not enough unfortunately ..
---
It should work like the assaultron helmet. Visor goes up when your weapon is holstered/ down when its drawn.
---
Yeah, there was one I saw awhile back that just had grated floors out over a cliff. They used confetti to conceal the missing floor pieces so you'd just fall to your death running over to the vending machines lol
---
Funny, because I find myself craving and playing PS1  and PS2 games when I feel burnt out with all the new games.
---
Maybe it's just me, but old games don't feel grindy even if they actually are. I wonder why that is.
---
Oh :/ that sucks. This game is missing a lot of mmo components
---
Yeah.  Ive definitely looked at it. Just not for me. Emergency protocols makes it loads easier but still
---
Which rifle type are you using? I wanted to use the Gauss but the awkwardness with vats and the model taking 1/4 of the screen is annoying. Lever action feels cool.
---
That would indeed be a lot of fun!
---
Meat hooks: Critical strikes generate that creature's meat (even human? :D)
---
Notification: “Careless vault dweller has yet again lured enemies to your camp and has decided to do fuck all about it”
---
I think it happens bc we are both on the same IP address, and obviously you are too if trying to load in a second account. Think it confuses the servers.  Restart, retry, cross fingers. Lol.
---
Cool
---
That requires Wasteland Whisperer.
---
You used all of the glue.......ON PURPOSE.....
---
Dear god yes.
---
Ya I feel the exact same, sometimes it gets to the point I dont really feel liking playing any games. I'm having one of those moments right now. I think I'm gonna learn html and JavaScript instead for a bit then once the brotherhood shows up maybe I'll jump back into 76
---
Honestly a .50 cal would be pretty cool
---
Theres at least one in the red Rocket mega shop, in the office near where Waste Not starts.
---
Do you happen to know if it’s exclusive to train station vendor bots? Or would Phoenix also have a chance sell it?
---
Some interesting stuff there! I could see me using that door. Not sure if I’d use the hanging basket, but it looks great.
---
It's already in NW. You'd just need to adjust the clip or damage.
---
I play them too, although the same issue arrises for me.
---
I dont want to make a list, but i own over 1k games atarai, nes, sega, snes, n64, os1/2/3 ports to pc, and mobile versions of some games, etc.
---
They dont like to load the extra ammo gained from high int.
---
Per the posts already on here scrapper is a potent perk and will allow you to obtain lots of steel, I run it all the time. Other method (if you are lazy and have caps) is to purchase all the bulk steel from the vendors in the Whitespring. There is around 1400-1500 steel (after scrapping all the bulk) available. With grape mentats/high CHR its around 63 caps per bulk making it a quick and easy purchase. I tend to buy it every day to keep topped up.
---
I swap main’s: one is a legendary lever action and the other is a high level marksman’s rifle.
---
My secondary is always a legendary shotgun which suits me fine in close quarters situations
---
I sided with the settlers initially and reached ally status about a month ago with them.  Just finished ally status with the raiders last night after exactly 2 months after doing the Vault 79 raid.  It's a pain having to do the daily's every single day.  Honestly though I bought the ammo machine and really like it.  Seems to spit out .556 at a decent rate to offset my ammo usage a bit.
---
Alot of my armor is quality of life type stuff though.
---
 Less fall damage, weapon weight reduction ect ect.
---
 I have always preferred leather armor in the FO universe so that's what I use.
---
 All the perks I have are based on my build for sure but I wasn't trying to squeeze every damage point out of it is all I meant.
---
 I'm sure there are things I can add and get rid of that will increase or optimize my performance but I'm really not that worried about it.
---
My recently 10 yr old son got into Fo76 because of me, his Fallout freak Dad. Now he's addicted to it and wants all the other Fallout titles 4, NV, 3. Only thing that disappoints me greatly is that I can't crossplay with him from my PC to his PS4.  :(
---
I'll try this, incredibly frustrating, especially since you can't manually load a core with the least ammo to get rid either.
---
&gt; And once everyone has everything then what?
---
Play the game, perhaps?
---
What? We don't use drugs, we just get addicted to them once.
---
same
---
1500 caps I think? give or take depending on your charisma and such.
---
Chinese Assault Rifle from FO3
---
Yep!  Stuff like this would be so much fun and create a lot more diversity.
---
How do you recruit the Raider Punk? Does he/she give quests like Sofia &amp; Beckett?
---
They nuke the bog because of the sbq
---
I'm thoroughly confused, how did they do/what is a "laugh emoji"?
---
Getting better every day hoss
---
After Fasnacht, I feel the same.  Seasons can't come soon enough.  Still holding out waiting for ~~Sims 76~~ Fallout 76: Cats &amp; Dogs.
---
Supposedly one of the new season rewards is an ammo converter.  I watched a video about it (juicehead I think) and it seems a bit underwhelming. 
---
But I agree we should be able to get at least steel and lead even at 50pct reduction.  Something like every 2 bullets gives 1 steel and 1 lead.
---
I usually hit my weapon swap shortcut (left on the D-Pad for Xbox) and the reload usually gets canceled
---
That would be amazing, especially if it worked with the companions
---

---
I have never found a crossbow in fallout 4. Is it a mod?
---
Does this reduce the number of waves? I like to farm this event for caps &amp; crafting mats.
---
Yeah, that's what I figured.
---
Best thing to do is take a break. I was like that for a while. Nothing was fun or seem fun. I thought I was burned out on games. I decided to take a walk one day. When I got home, I felt great and decided to go for another one. Next day same thing. That was a year ago. I started going to the gym, lost 100 pounds and counting AND slowly made my way back to enjoying video games again. 
---
Best bet is to walk away for a while, find something else you enjoy and work your way back to gaming eventually. Hang in there!
---
No problem, it's an amazing resource. Thank the Maker!
---
Yes but when i played was not a good mod....dont know these days
---
Tyler County Dirtrack has a safe, in the spectators/announcers box.
---
Ah okay. I play on PS4 so I will never know.
---
Not sure what safes and workshops have to do with each other but I used to have an awesome safe farming route.  
---
Basically check out the cabins all around Top of the World and only loot the safe(s) if it had a rare plan.  There are also a lot of plans laying around the general area and a lot of tin can traps that yield lead.
---
Still trying. I usually check each time I jump on. But sometimes I forget. Other times I will jump 10-15 times in a row just to try.
---
You can get a good number of bloatfly glands from a cave between Freddy Fear's House of Scares and Site alpha from Queen of the Hunt.
---
Usually spawns 3-6 glowing bloatflies and two glowing honey beast.
---
Okk. I ll check it out. Sometimes they dont let me to join the world bcz of "modified game files" and I have no mods so far. Hope it will work.
---
I am just going to have to wait until somebody launches a nuke elsewhere. it's a weekly challenge so maybe I'll be able to get it done myself sometime
---
Didn't take long to rebuild.
---
Unfortunately I'm Xbox
---
as far as i know it's the exact same number of waves but you just kill them quicker as they are right there
---
Like Cannibals/Everyone getting chunks of Strange Meat for gibbing a human enemy with Bloody Mess or explosives.
---
That's one I'd like to see.
---
Edit: words.
---
YES. I love that gun so much.
---
Just experience it done today, so someone definitely read this thread.
---
Honestly it was too easy, or rather it was easy for people with explosive affix weapons and their teammates.
---
Meanwhile those who bough say a scorched slaying hunting rifle managed to barely eke out dozen kills.
---
I sent a request :)
---
That would have been great cause I'm sitting on a lot of .44 ammo that no one buys and don't want to drop like 600+ cause thts just wasteful lol. cant sell to vendors which is BS TBH
---
Half of these player's got issues,Sadly
---
what is that black power armor?
---
Good to know. I had cusioned until I could find two acrobat pieces.  I will look into this!
---
**Toxic Larrys**. Red case on the bed upstairs, sometimes has two maps. Handy place too, 3x Snallygasters for Acid (one is crowned so occasionally drops a map). 2x Bobblehead spawns, and 2x Magazines. Also handy for Sugar.
---
Found one after a few months, traded a decent set of armor for another, found a third at the watoga vendor, whoever sold it must not have known its rarity.
---
Yeah I know. I posted on LFG last time asking if anyone had a nuke in whiteSrping, someone invited me to a server which had. Very few get dropped there any more. 
---
For me It is not worth the headache just to get a few atoms, not sure why they don't drop in WhiteSpring anymore.
---
All my weapons have been prematurely reloading. Not sure if it’s a visual bug, but my fixer reloads with 5 to 7 still in the magazine.
---
Me, but only on days that end with "Y"
---
Wow I didn't know thanks for the info.
---
So scrap one helmet then start scrapping armour
---
It was one of the first things I found there. I didn't know it was special and rare. I'm not an outfits guy, so I just wound up vendoring it to some train station bot.
---
I still wince thinking about it.
---
That's the full thing, what we're going to get in 20 is just a teaser
---
Or even a display for the giant mr. Fuzzy head , the bunny or the rat.
---
DAMN you're lucky!!!
---
Some armor gives poison resistance. I have a vanguard chest piece that gives 25% poison resistance and queens attacks don't immediately destroy me anymore.
---
Service rifle. Loved the way it looked and handled.
---
Check the comments in the post...XD
---
I have tried every log in, for over a year some times hopping to several servers.. and have offered up my whole stash for it and still no luck.... I have every rare outfit in game except that one... It's a real pain in my ass and soul crushing lol
---
Regular gas mask, yes. Assault gas mask, no
---
Nice, good luck!
---
Oh, Ok.... there are only a few metal objects that fly - vertibots (helicopters) and cargobots (overgrown drones).
---
You’ll see a standard cargobot when you do the Collision Course event at Morgantown airport.    Thats a good event Especially for low level players, as you get XP and caps for completing the event, and both aid items and weapons rom the cargobot drop.
---
Cargobots usually buzz around unescorted.  They usually deliver the US supply drops that for whatever reason, didnt drop when you made the request.  
---
Strategic cargobots look the same as regular cargobots, but are usually escorted by 3 Strategic Vertibots.  
---
Both regular and strategic cargobots transport a variety of items (weapons/aid), but the strategic ones also carry nuclear key cards.  They must be shot down in order to get the cargo (and the card).  If present, The strategic vertibots will shoot at you while you are shooting at the strategic cargobot
---
Take some molotovs next time :p
---
So still no word on SeSe ultra light mods for the limbs?
---
There's always a video from angryturtle. ;) But yes, I'm pretty sure he did one on stealth though I think it's before the stealth suit. Personally, I have like 9 agil and I find that having one stealth perk works well enough for most situations. It's definitely noticable without the perk at all though. With just one level I can sneak up to the queen and hit her a good five or six times with my gauntlet before I get noticed, usually by some trash mob.
---
I usually play after everyone is asleep so this is perfect. Add me on Aztec_Knight10
---
&gt; the only things left with be cockroaches, Twinkies and concern trolls.
---
Kinda feels like we're already there if you watch the news. ;)
---
Yeah most of them do, it's hard to tell with normal ammo of it's a visual bug but I can guarantee it's not the case with cores.
---
You nailed it. I have tried Conan, Ark, Rust etc in terms of open world survival and although i have had some fun i just never stuck around. Although 76 lacks real survival elements it does give me that fix in a light version. I need to eat and drink though resource wise not a problem once you figure it out. And you get to build glorious camps!! 
---
The building system, although a pain in the ass to use sometimes is intuitive and easy to use. The ability to store and move my camp easily (some of the time) or just store building pieces is one of my favourite aspects. I can build, get bored, move and rebuild again instantly. 
---
Also the big problem i had was i would play solidly on a server for a few weeks, get bored, play something else and come back to a wiped server. 76's system means i can play for a while, go play something else and come back and pick up where i left off. Though private servers with different rule sets and mods on top really would push this game to a 10/10. And yes the bugs but then when you play games like Ark and Conan you get used to it and always a sacrifice i happily pay.
---
Damn...hope you'll get one soon
---
Well it’s true! Next will be Fallout 2nd - infinite stash box *
---
All the bugs we hate patched **
---
Bigger CAMP budget, persistent workshops and regularly updated exclusive free Atom store items. ***
---
* ^Fallout ^1st ^required.
---
** ^These ^fixes ^only ^apply ^in ^private ^servers
---
*** ^We ^meant ^to ^include ^these ^in ^Fallout ^1st ^but ^we ^didn’t.
---
I had a player harass me once...I ft away...then noticed everywhere he went he took a long time...obviously walking &amp; his camp was at the other end of the map, so I went to the closest silo &amp; guess what happend next. He didn't bother to log off, so I visited the ruins &amp; left him a blue gift box with two items...salt &amp; a note.
---
Ah. So, no skill. Just waste time...
---
Lol thanks me to.. I'm about to put another post up to try again.. I am offering and 25/30 pieces from my spreadsheet for the dress, so fingers crossed
---
Undeservingly so!  Unfortunately it’s just pure dumb luck.  I read a few data miners say it has a 1:20,000 chance to spawn.
---
Just remember there is also plenty of countries out there that have it contained. For some of us quarantine is over.
---
Also has a level three safe in the outhouse (bottom right of the box the toilet sits on).
---
I stand corrected then. I only have one account. I always figured they were available to everyone.
---
nope the teaser questline Steel Dawn is supposed to come in fall/autum and in winter the full stuff with Fractured Steel
---
I've lost a couple of scorchbeasts in the last few days, both killed in the air.
---
yep. FO76 is a bore right now. And the bugs don't make it any better.
---
Whatever the alien rifles from Mothership Zeta were called.
---
I just want a good energy rifle.
---
If you want to hide which set of PA you are wearing get it.
---
Excellent, and now that it's on here, you can be sure it'll get fixed soon. Thanks.
---
If they have pacifist turned off it would count as you attacking them believe me greifers know how to exploit it.
---
I absolutely hated that mechanic from bioshock lol. Honestly it doesnt need an incentive, it just needs to die. There's no reason for it to exist when photomode is a thing. The quests that require it are there to make it relevant, those can die too for all I care. Tired of clearing the clutter from my gallery
---
Same but with games in general.  There's lots of factors, but a big one is loneliness in games.
---
What I liked about 76 at first was playing with a couple buddies, but I also liked the loneliness when I went solo.  Before Wastelanders I really liked that my character was unknowingly chasing ghosts.
---
But now... I just want to play with some friends again or not play at all.
---
Yes it is lol they had one dungeon type raid on one of the vaults but it got removed before I even got to play it :( something to do with a timer that wouldn’t stop even after completing what u had to do
---
you better not be playing in squads because then you're an asshole.
---
So some of those may have been the same world again.  You don't always change worlds when you server hop.
---
If you are sure they were different worlds then you are clearly in a popular build area and you either pay that price or move.  I maybe get this problem 3 times a week.
---
I literally had to change my camp location, I knew that my old place was popular, and it was fine for a few weeks... But after having to switch the server like 5 times, I had enough and moved my stuff to the most random ass location 😅
---
Where???
---
All I see is he is excited about public teams. I’ve already seen this tweet before
---
PSN: SirCreamcorn
---
I don't talk much anyways and I play a lot!
---
Hey I have friend who just doesn’t like to use the mic . So I understand and he hits me to get my attention instead of texting. Lol. It’s just faster!! My gamer tag is HammerWarhead188 if you want to send a friend quest.
---
Aw crap. It’s all good. Be well man!
---
For me it’s depression and burnout. BGS games are like 80% of what I play anyways so occasionally I just have to give it a break. Fallout 4 actually afforded me a quite lengthy break from Fallout 3 and New Vegas, so recently when I felt burnt out on 76, Fallout 4, and Skyrim I decided to pick up vanilla Fallout 3 for the first time in years. That game brought me right back to when I was 11 discovering the game. So much stuff I forgot about and so much Nostalgia!
---
Good thing you have belly full of cat to get you through it!
---
Morgantown is by far the most fun to nuke. Lots of enemies spawning over several locations, lots of different fluxes. Only downside, no legendaries.
---
Oh, I definitely know what I lost. Ignorance is bliss, and I wish I never knew how rare it is.
---
Oh well, it is what it is.
---
so unless I completely devote my life to video games I may as well not play them at all?
---
Is that really your interpretation here? Are you serious? 
---
Of course. Why even ask? Of course a redditor would say that.
---
It drives me crazy when it happens.
---
frog habitats are created in workshop mode so not exactly. The jar is made at a chemistry bench with glass and bloodleaf i think, the captured frog must be in junk as well.
---
That's not too bad.  Ok thank you
---
Surprised then that I never experienced this happening. Always assume the smackers are trying to annoy me enough to pvp, so also assumed they already have pacifist turned off so they can wreck me quick (if this does initiate pvp as you have said) before I have the chance to turn it off.
---
To the OP: It is cool you have fun with your kid. Just supervise him to avoid any unpleasant surprise. Unfortunately, even in the best community, there are still shitty persons that might try to get advantage of a minor (or anybody, for that matter). Enjoy and be safe...
---
To the concern trolls out there: it is not the games you let your kids play what make them shitty persons... It is the shitty education you give to them in real life, by letting games educate your kids instead of doing it yourself..
---
Bring the downvotes...
---
Offer to have a time when you can be revived.
---
it's a cool idea for a themed store anyways. Pioneer Scout Inc.
---
lol a crazy medic that’s super good at breaking others’ limbs, yea maybe they should tone it down slightly so others can tag the boss too. But still instant scrip and xp for everyone who simply showed up lol
---
Hey man, I’m on Xbox and if you guys are too and if he ever runs into trolls on it, I’ll try to take care of some of them with him if he wants help.
---
Try harpers ferry for violet, I have walked away with 160+.
---
Count me in, starscream205_
---
Maybe time to move then - seems you’ve got a popular spot
---
How about a fix for mistaken identity so it can be done more then once per character...
---
Edit: Fixed typo
---
I got this desk fan I wanna disassemble for screws... bright side? It’s also plastic
---
I signed in to PTS yesterday afternoon, and I was all alone.
---
All I know for sure is it's a thing and it's gotten a lot worst now and it not just for this some are trying to annoy to get you to kill them so they can start trying to glitch into the revenge God mode bug...   Yaaaaa at this point anybody trying to PvP is fucked and anybody running around just whacking people is just trying to exploit in my books.

---
I get the water people and the bush people so much. They don’t even loot, just hide in a bush. I don’t understand why they queue with a team instead of solo. I’ve started to just build around them to delete the bushes so they’re sat in the open with a huge “I’m right here” sign
---
Not sure if you know but you can share your xbox gold with him instead of buying a second one.  Its awesome you and him bond over video games it my son and mine favorite past time
---
Ah man, wish you were on xbox. It'd be nice to have another deaf person tagging along, it gets tiresome having to explain to people that I can't hear them only for them to be gone once I finish sending the message. like you said though, it makes it difficult to team up since everyone wants to use mics.
---
If I reload by accident I just put the gun away. But this isn't reloading by accident. I see a few fixes here which I'll take into consideration. But this shouldn't be happening. If the queen lands or if your fighting anything else you shouldn't have to be postponing your attack to fix a problem Bethesda should be fixing. Thanks for the advice though
---
You can add me. My psn is Soveskog.
---
With all of those damned mounted head plans we should choose what mounted head or picture we wish to display. The current choice is underwhelming and I would never by this.
---
First person is great unless you are a shotgunner.
---
LOL.. upvoted.
---
Me with games in general lately. I’m newer to 76, been playing around 2 months, level 68. Had a blast and haven’t finished any main storylines but I think having being forced to stay home (until more recently), caused a little video game burnout. Idk if you were joking or not, but I think it is partially depression, partial boredom and just the need to take a break from playing games daily. Also, I only have one real life friend who plays 76 with me, so I tend to get bored quicker playing solo.
---
Edit: To add my my comment, and reading some others, I love hiking and go on hikes every week usually, sometimes I skip a week here and there. Being physical helps a ton and gets me motivated to get back home and game it up. Also my partner has been getting into house plants and I’ve been getting into the coffee hobby which is fun since I absolutely love coffee.
---
Fuck does it ever piss me off when I get piece of shit legendary wood armor piece
---
You must eat rabbit's feet for breakfast.
---
I just don't have the time or resources at the moment. I'm going to shoot for doing it myself this weekend.
---
What..?
---
it would be nice if we could use legendary modules to upgrade a level 35 3* lever action say to level 45
---
it bugs me when I kill an enemy and get a bloodied faster reload etc
---
owls?
---
Does it spawn in a specific place in the asylum or can it spawn anywhere a regular dress spawns?
---
Except if they have atom shop skins on items they won't show up in trade and could swap them in after.
---
Yeah I'm waiting for the collision mechanic to be fixed to allow hanging pictures etc. Apparently this is actually gonna get fixed I got a message about it from the Devs yesterday.
---
I have a sweet view in my current place and no one ever had a camp there except one person the whole time I've been playing
---
I feel ya. I hope it’s paced decently. Seems like we have 3 months to complete things in most cases
---
no i don’t. that’s really smart idea. thanks!
---
Cool I'll check it out thanks!
---
That would be nice, but you should just be rocking SS armor, once you have access to it there's really zero incentive to work toward any other armor.  It's hands down better DR than any other type, and you can craft them legendary.
---
Is the Forrest asylum hat rare?
---
I usually have a good time, an essential skill for that is spotting the fucking pricks in your team and muting them, then just have fun.
---
That's exactly what I'm gonna do but with the shed (for now). Love to see it!
---
After server hopping for a half hour I finally landed on a map that Morgantown area had been nuked. I managed to grab some Cobalt flux before the server crashed. Thank you to everyone who commented on this post. I'm still going to try to just do it myself next time I need it.
---
Whatever you say meatbag.
---
I've never encountered a griefer and I've been playing since beta
---
Idk, plug in your mouse/controller?
---
It shows up for me under ultracite ammo. Between 10mm and 5.56
---
I’m also a level 120 something
---
Ha ha
---
yeah I know about those though I would rather assume they're part of the questline that should come in fall as it is supposed to lead up to Fractured Steel and otherwise they would've given us a heads up or teaser for it when they announced they're pulling the perks and new event from the upcoming patch.
---
3 months....
---
I can just imagine all the people reading this knowing they wouldn't add you right up until it mentions you're a girl and then they immediately start entering your psn and send you a f/r
---
You know what I need some springs I’m going to disassemble my toaster
---
Yeah I could do this, I already have two friends I’ve been playing with for months who don’t have mics, been communicating with em purely by PSN messages and emotes, so this would be fine. I sent ya a friend request, we’ll play sometime.
---
(Ah do you use the PlayStation messager app on a phone or mobile device? It’s really handy in situations like this.)
---
Yea talk about a punch in the gut, I've  got lucky and have pieced together a full set of unyielding + strength, BOS heavy combat. Now that the legendary perks are dropping I feel even luckier.
---
Lincolns Repeater ornated and all with the same sight. And not an weapon, but i would really like to have the prototype medic power armor added :)
---
Apparently learning that Prime Plan doesn't unlock the ammo for it. You need to learn the Prime Gauss Rifle one to unlock the ammo. I believe it's a bug and they plan on fixing it...probably in the next big update.
---
Edited for Clarity
---
You're super lucky...
---
Do you have any under armors? Try getting one from the whitesprings vendors and applying it on that
---
Yep I’ve never been able to find one myself. I’ve spent hours server hoping - like all weekend just hopping in and out and no luck
---
I thin anywhere but the best place is on the 3rd floor
---
None of the hats are rare as they have static spawns
---
Damn..

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Oh stimpak diffusers!!! That's the one challenge I can't complete, someone do this on xbox please! ☺️☺️
---
There’s 3 spawn points in the third floor I believe
---
I don't know..but i don't think so cause I've found a bunch of them
---
Good to know
---
[Yea, it’s not there :/](https://imgur.com/a/0FDGRNP)

Only so many bone clubs and rolling pins one needs. I'll take reliable mobs and flux thanks!! ;)
---
It's the aesthetic. The UI and sound design had me hooked as a kid.
---
Yeah dude, it’s a pain in the ass forsure. I should add that once I switch BACK to my gun with the early reload (in my case, the Ultracite Gatling Laser) my remaining charges will be in the “clip”, and I’ll be able to empty it.
---
Hey, may I be a fellow Vault dweller and say to your son, welcome to the wasteland kid! Hope he has fun and rebuilds america with you every step of the way. Hopefully nothing stands in your guy's path in Appalachia. And whatever you do! Tell him not to go to the Cranberry Bog tell he's ready. He will prolly not want his character to be creamed by Scortched Beasts.

From your fellow Vault 76 dweller, welcome to the wasteland kid!

(Best way to get caps is to sell the tatos while you have the green thumb perk and the barter perk. just a tip to your kid)
---
Ah ok, when does that update come out?
---
Yah I'm pretty fast at responding with the app lol
---
Try making anew character and run a better build than whatever shit you're using
---
Put down the controller.. enjoy walks outdoors for a few days. Stretch your legs, get some sun.. it’s good for ya
---
Save yer stimpaks for a while. Also dilute them with the chemistry bench. Do not use full stimpaks. Sell chems in the beginning. If you need stimpaks make some runs to Morgantown airport. Great place, especially if you have pharma pharma perk. Use melee for a while and if ranged I usually run around with a hunting rifle and snipe then run in melee.
---
Not the answer you probably want to hear, but if your camp is in such a popular and highly contested spot, you might want to consider moving it somewhere else.
---
Some camp locations are just not viable anymore simply due to their popularity.
---
Make it a foundation tile not a floor so you don't have a 3 foot pool on the second floor
---
Hmm, guess I shouldnt have posted that I'm a girl? 🤔
---
What exactly are you having trouble with?
---
Yeah, Fallout was never an emotionally taxing game. There are surely some very dark moments, but overall it's a very relaxing experience - especially 76.
---
The next big one, Update 20, is supposed to roll out on June 30th. I am not sure if the fix will be included in it, but that's probably the earliest they will.
---
Naaa I Wana put my broken water wheels down on top of cliffs with a veiw next to a junk pile
---
i have given up on 3\* sentrybot loot, once they splode - they gone
---
Yeah you can do the quests for both factions until you have to choose
---
I'm pretty sure the only weapons that have bleed are melee weapons, besides there's way better perks than bleeding and you can get perks that increases your heavy guns chance to cripple and knockback
---
Combat, getting caps and survival. The entire game pretty much
---
The game gives you a pretty clear directive to make weapons and armor. Make a machete and some leather armor. Continue to upgrade these every 5 levels. Invest perks into charisma and max Lone Wanderer. Then, invest in strength and max gladiator, you get 1 point for free at the start of the game. So at lvl 8 you should be pretty formidable. You'll hit a wall around lvl 30 but by then hopefully you're less of a bot.
---
You should definitely do all quests for both until it makes you choose which isnt that early. Easy rep that you'll lose out on if you dont do.
---
If he's level 8...how did he kill a level 24 two times in a row?
---
Back when players could break your camp and get a bounty for it there was a message saying “______ is attacking your camp!”
---
I remember some douchebag broke my door down to get into my house while I was away, and the only thing he broke was my Sheepsquach Plushie, Mr Snugglesworth... Hope a storm from the divide skins him alive.
---
What do you play on
---
Oh for sure. I’ve never had any inclination to go back into 76 after they threw a boss some 50 levels higher than me which I couldn’t outrun and proceeded to maim me repeatedly until I’d lost all the ammo I’d built up over hours of solo play. 
---
Fallout 4 was linear nonsense, I’ve never wanted to pick that up again after one play through.
---
I love Fallout 3 and NV dearly but I’ve played through them both 10 odd times each so that’s kinda done for me as well. 
---
Depressed about the situation is a good summation. Mostly because I don’t believe there will ever be a decent Fallout game again after the sack of shite 4 was.
---
Ay thanks
---
Yeah. I have some beastly "conventional (non-legacy)" weapons that people are always fawning over, but only the people with nothing to trade. Do I want to sell you my Junkies FFR fr minigun for 1000 caps? No please.
---
Oh cool, thanks for the info man :)
---
Bugs in general and people weren't pleased with the input/outcome ratio as different vault missions kept spamming enemies endlessly at you without any bigger reward except the hope for RNG to give you something usefull at the end.
---
Only problem for me with this fix is that I only pull this gun out for the queen and my hotbar is usually full. "Why the fuck am I over encumbered? Oh, I have 10 fusion cores I thought were empty and discarded but aren't"
---
Baths for now it seems, unless you wanna work with the power connectors/emitters to make a shower head protrude from the wall but it may look ghetto. Never done it as I just shit in the woods and go feral without bathing in anything but radiation and the green crap SB's fill the air with.
---
Shoulder mounted machine gun from New Vegas! Because it's a minigun, but shoulder mounted! Very original!
---
How long has the broken shotgun thing been around? A LONG LONG TIME! 
---
it is a mechanic of the game that you can block spawn points of enemies. Has been since day dot. 
---
Example: Fasnacht. 
---
Where did the sloth appear? Where did the spawns appear at the end? Nearly always out of sight of players. Because most people went to the places they'd seen it spawn. BUT because there were people there or looking at the spot it didn't spawn there. 
---
Radiation rumble. People think they're doing a good thing by waiting at the points the ghouls spawn. So the game goes 'gg' and spawn ghouls in the radiation shower room. And before you know it the scavengers are swamped. 
---
If this is fixed any time soon it's been in the works for a while. They've got to come up with a new mechanic for enemies spawning. 
---
Just for some reason it's programmed to spawn them all right there when the spawn points are compromised at line in the sand.
---
Thorn armor set has bleed
---
You could try hoarding as many gauss rifles as possible and then scrap them for those sweet mod unlocks
---
But not everyone wants to play as a temporary test character who's progress is not saved after the test is done.
---
NP. I may have an extra plan for the Prime Rifle lying around you can just have. I am currently not online, but I'll check when I can and let you know here.
---
Why not launch one yourself? A couple of pieces of troubleshooters armour and youre good to go.
---
If you want some help I can try to help you out and figure out what your doing I am on my second character first was 200 then got bored on my commando build and now I’m about 140 with my new bow/pistol build.
---
Yeah man, i have played fo3 and nv a couple times both of them, and still love them, true story and gameplay, Golden days for V.A.T.S.
---
The option to turn photos into poster wallprints.
---
Other than that I use it as my backup bino's thanks to the zoom on it.
---
you on PC?  I'm only missing the two white dresses away from the full set.  I'd consider a trade for that kind of commitment. :)  here's my trade list if you're interested.

---
Oh dope!! That would be awesome, I appreciate you offering :) hmu if you do have one
---
Okay
---
Lol, you can learn prime receiver plans from scrapping? I thought that was plan only.
---
Toxic lake bed up north has a ton of it too if I remember correctly.
---
I dont think a 1x1 square is big enough for either of those things sadly.
---
Thank you.
---
The Prime one wouldn't unlock that way. You need to learn that one via recipe. The others are nice, but not what the OP needs.
---
My GT is Sk8npurplehippy
---
When you say the first town, are you referring to Flatwoods?
---
It was revealed as a Seasons reward power armor skin a few weeks ago. This one's entirely black, but there's another one colored white with a gold face shield and tints.
---
Lol one time I was in a squad and 2 guys who were clearly working together tried to get me and the other squadmate killed by telling us to spawn at a location that is supposedly shitty and then they got killed be the area enemies cuz they weren't paying attention and me and the other guy got sweet weapons like a gatling gun and some power armor n shit
---
They don't hunt, every hunter I've ever hunted with or talked to is full smh at these Karens. Might be an age thing.. the older gen is full fudd.
---
Idk anymore, I know I've unlocked prime receivers on a lot of other guns by scrapping them
---
What the controller does with the square button after I leave is beyond my control.
---
Usually, they never spawn for me there, but I've found it easier to find them in meat bags at super mutant camps or at the raider hideout in Berkeley Springs (can't think of the name). But hitting up this spawn point is definitely the best option if they load 😅
---
My little brother is 12... I started him on Grand Theft Auto at 7. He knows what is appropriate in real life vs what he sees in the game and we've never had a problem with any cussing or anything else from him... Only negative is now he kicks my ass in just about anything haha
---
Ye, couldn't remember the name
---
Just as effective as playing with far less time invested.
---
They nerfed legendary spawns at the whitespring
---
Appreciate it.
---
OP I struggled with WS too. I know people make it work and I can't discount it- but in my server I swapped to Morgantown and the results are undeniable. I walked out with dozens. Can recommend giving it a try at least.
---
Ah, the good old days, when you had to spend money to make money.
---
Not worth it. Only time I ever hope for a whitespring nuke is when the weekly requires you to gather flux.
---
I always forget its exact spot and will end up getting close enough to aggro something. Which then gets everything else's attention.
---
I know the god mode glitch is blowing up on YouTube so that makes sense. Just surprised since I play A LOT (thanks to covid) and even with god mode “trending” it hasn’t happened to me. Not saying you’re wrong, just perplexed given it probably should have happened to me by now.
---
Oh yeah...that was fun.
---
Geez, I feel old.
---
I will take a close look at this area, thank you so much!
---
1.) just keep at it—you’ll become more proficient with time
---
2.) keep your camp basic, build a lot of water purifiers and sell the water to AI vendors to make some caps
---
3.) Scrap rather than sell guns and armor, you’ll both get both raw materials and learn mods that will make the guns and armor more effective.
---
I love my pro snap! Makes some awesome load up images! Although I'm with ya, a neat little buff to it would be cool!
---
I mean without legendary effects.
---
These stories make me smile.
---
Thanks :)
---
2019: There's nothing to grind for, this sucks!
---
2020: The grind is to long to get a perfect set of god-roll equipment!
---
Ah ok
---
If you wanna run around with my friends and I my PSN is Namauri.
---
Concern trolls lol. Kare Barons
---
Dont forget to use the scrapper perk. An not just super mutants. Any enemies that have guns. Morgantown airport/ grafton steel/ blackwater mine/ lucky hole mine/ west tek etc.
---
i hAte iT sO No oNE eLsE cAn eNJoY iT
---
I mean it'll definitely get you more friends but there is always the risk of getting the creepy dudes now
---
If you go to the campground and speak to the scout leader, the bug parts quests becomes a daily after you become a tadpole. If you go to him to get it, it will give you the location, so you can mark it and farm it 😊
---
Wrong sub for this, but a lot.  Probably won’t get you a legacy weapon but could get you just about anything else outside of high end fixers
---
Wow it's as if all opinions are valid and I'm allowed to voice mine.
---
When I get in a server that my camp can't place, I always check go look at the camp thats there and judge them.
---
Believe it or not, I used to be horrendous, couldn't kill a super mutant skirmisher . 🤣
---
This is coming from a veteran who can solo queens. Don't worry, you'll figure it out.
---
Valid does not mean immune to criticism
---
Good call.
---
I haven’t played too much lately (I blame work and warzone ha) but i actually prefer messaging on psn vs mic for various reasons. Feel free to add me if you’d like - Psn: happymfeet 
---
Also I can hook you up with some decent weapons/armors or ammo (just let me know your build preferences) since I only use about 5 of my weapons and don’t trade much anymore
---
Does that alarm tower function similarly?
---
I have one. My psn is Palindromesix. Add me and I can run it to you quick now...I'm only available for like 5 minutes now. If you're not available now, I'll be on for a while in about 6 hours.
---
Don’t say that!!! Todd is listening while his eyes fill up with $$$$$$$
---
I hunt griefers.i make plenty of orbital strikes and easily drop nukes solo.im only level 90.i have been ambushed alot by 3 or 4 on 1 too many times.so now i wipe them out off the map..i love completely leveling their camp.
---
oh great.  let the grind begin.
---
Okay? What part of your response constitutes criticism? If you wanna have a conversation about the merits of the camera I'm all ears. Belittling my opinion doesn't contribute much.
---
Sweet, mine is baerlythere420, sending you a request now
---
There are other games just saying
---
I forgot how. He's just a random event when you find him and need to pass a Charisma check I think. He only gives out weapon case daily quests.
---
Saying you hate something and providing no improvements or suggesting isn’t really contributing either honestly.
---
fusion core-powered mount?
---
What does it go for? Never found one
---
Hopping into your world
---
I’m just glad to see I’m not the only motherfucker that noticed that there was a blast shield/visor up there.
---
Cool. I'm at my camp. I currently don't have a mic, so expect waving.
---
That’s a very powerful and desirable weapon. I’d encourage you to build a character for it, rather than trade/sell it.
---
There’s a sub dedicated to buying/selling, that has a feature called “price check”, which is where your inquiry probably belongs.
---
Pretty much... I can't even begin to tell you the amount of songs I've heard as an adult vs as a kid and I'm like "WOW THAT'S WHAT THEY MEANT! "
---
There are often player camps near vault 76. Even if feel like you have no caps to buy stuff look if the camps owner is at the camp, go there and ask for help, they may drop you some stuff. I have a camp near the overseers first camp. I always have level 5 guns stocked, modded for best damage and give them away for 9caps max. Plus some basic plans and armor for low levels. I don't sell those very often since a lot of fresh players don't even check vendors which is a mistake imo. I guess there are a lot of players out there who provide similar items catered for the fresh starters. Get a decent .38 gun for trash enemies, save your 10mm and .45 ammo for tougher enemies.
---
If you struggle with combat try sneaking on your enemies and shoot them unnoticed. Always have a melee available since most of the low enemies try to rush at you. Don't let ghouls come too close, they hit hard and radiate you. Scrap every gun you find and don't need to learn plans and upgrade the guns you use. Kill every brahmin, pick every lock for the experience. If a high level player waves at you just go to him, he will probably gift you some ammo, water and stims.
---
Another case of fallout fever
---
I said it should be removed as it serves no purpose. You're welcome to rebut this claim if you wish.
---
Lol no worries, mine is hooked up to my laptop rn
---
As someone not deaf I still don't use a mic all that much because I'm usually duel screening with something else on it anyways. I'm on Xbox or I'd hit you up but good luck bro, not everybody wants to use mics even if they have one.
---
OH YEAH I REMEMBER PLAYING FALLOUT 3 WITH MY UNCLE WHEN I WAS AROUND 8, oh, I remember always playing with tgm because the game was kind of too hard for a 8yo and all that stuff, the experience was totally epic. now i'm a die-hard Fallout fan and all thanks to my uncle, I'm so thankful and I love him so much
---
And what the OP is suggesting is a purpose for the camera..
---
Touche, now I'm a lil worried about the amount of creeps I'll get :/
---
I call it 'My Alt f4 moments', you log in hit the map, realize that the 'content' is the exact same stuff you've done a thousand times and just hit alt f4.
---
Maybe you live in an area of the world with less fo76 players, thus less servers close by?
---
I'm just spitballing because I live East Coast US and I've never once had it not put me on a new server immediately.
---
I accidentally introduced my nephews to this at the beginning of this year when they watched me play. Now they absolutely love the game and have been begging their mother to get it for them. She is not happy with me about it since she doesn't like the bloody games, but I let them play Fallout 4 when they're with me. They're better at the game than I am.
---
Okay, and my rebuttal was that it should be removed. What was your contribution again?
---
What console? I nuke like it's my job. I've started nuking trap camps because there are only so many queens I want to do in a day
---
Wait ghoulslayer doesn't work on Wendigos? I figured it did.
---
Thank you so much man!!
---
Also I have mad flux if u need some.
---
What level are you? I'm fairly new I'm a level 15 and am also looking for teammates
---
PSN ID Gumbybum21
---
I know some ASL, not that it helps in this situation, but I wouldn't mind helping to bridge some gaps between the deaf and hearing communities.
---
NP. Glad to help. I still had a few random Prime plans left after Christmas. Luckily, that was one. Good luck out there.
---
I would love more scout stuff. Still do the daily toxic clean up (by my house) and campfire tales to farm badges since 8 got them all in challenves a while back
---
I don't play much but if you want to add me my own is Lightningspider
---
You are a champion, good luck to you too :)
---
So your complaint is “it has no purpose and so should be removed” Op says “here’s what could be the purpose” and your argument is still “no it should be removed” - I’m with op- I would love bonuses to be added to the camera as well as being able to display your picture in your camp etc. So... your only contribution is “if I don’t like it, no one else can have it” ? Nah
---
Very very valuable, probs a top 3 bloodied handmade behind the b2525 and b3325
---
Sneaky little so and so, like it. He will do well.
---
I play COD and Fortnite, and while the Fortnite pass is easy, I know the stress of completing both. I just hope that Fallout’s activities are easy
---
June 30th Alledgedly.
---
I’ll give ya 532 caps for it. HMU if interested.
---
Vats. Vats. And more vats. Lol but really just takes patience I guess until you start getting better weapons and armor. Whenever you find a better gun and you aren’t using a level 5 one or the same thing with armor, scrap them to learn the mods to mod up you’re newer weapons. I never knew that. I would just sale them. 
---
Also take your time with things (not saying you don’t or anything. Just speaking broadly) and explore some places you haven’t gone yet. Don’t worry about following the story step by step. Take some time just looking around and definitely do events if you see some people doing them. Won’t hurt :) gives you a good chance to get some good armor or weapons and gives you either stims, food, water, or radway which will come in handy when you feel like you won’t make it out of a battle lol
---
Quad crossbow with explosive bolts is really fun
---
Wrong.. I've tamed a mirelurk king with only level 3 animal friend.
---
You do need a random encounter one to spawn in order to take it.
---
Okay, I respect your opinion. Thank you for being constructive.
---
Furious because you get 45% quicker with flamer barrel and better accuracy.
---
If you're on ps4, I'd pay 10k caps for it
---
Any reason you didn’t use a courier?
---
If you put a pulse reciever on, with a flamer barrel Its full auto with really high dps, but its glitched to work with rifleman perks (while full auto)
---
It’s already in the game bro
---
Yes. Also helps to have the Eagle Eyes mutation.
---
Honestly, that's a really great idea. I adore Bioshock and having that research camera added a challenge to get bonuses on as many enemies as I could 😂
---
Another thing I've always wanted is a photobook for our Camps, people could click on it and view all the crazy pictures you've taken during the game, you could choose which ones to put in it and then it wouldn't just be a loading screen. I've taken some rad shots I've always wanted to share with people lol
---
People really need to stop throwing around the word depressed for such bullshit shit posting like this dude, what the fuck. 
---
Get your points without trying to take advantage of the sympathy karma you knew you would get out of posting this. You undermine the people who truly have depression and that's not okay man, regardless of your edit.
---
I wish we had the option to where if I’m in a game and my survival tent is taking up an incoming players base, then I should be asked to move it which I 100% would. 
---
I know some people probably wouldn’t but I know for a fact there’s some kind souls out in the wasteland that would be willing to help another survivor out :)
---
I’ve encountered 2 since beta.  That’s it.  This community is generally pretty cool.
---
The furious is a much better rifle in my opinion, would make a great queen gun if you prime it (which you should def do for ammo efficiency).
---
That looks pretty sweet I like that
---
Will be on later. Will send a request. Name is the same as my reddit.
---
Did they mention it in inside the vault or somethin or is this just a rumor?
---
When trying to figure out where to go for violet I nuked both General’s Steakhouse and Harper’s Ferry. For me Harper’s wasn’t quite as good. Not as many nasties to farm and worst of all the glowing ghouls in The Burrows don’t drop all the stable flux materials.
---
Ngl my alarm clock looking kinda funky doe😳
---
I've launched one nuke a few weeks ago before I knew about flux. I'm going to try again.
---
I might have encountered a griefer and never realized it cuz they couldn't do damage to me
---
I would love for them to introduce fishing into the game thru the Pioneer scouts as well.
---
I recently primed a TSE Gauss, and it gets crazy good ammo efficiency, which i kinda why I made this as I want to prime the Plasma next. Just have to start farming cobalt flux, but Morgantown is good for that. Thank you for your help!
---
Yeah, the tesla cannon was one of my favorite weapons
---
I'm PS4 and for the challenge you need to collect it yourself. But thank you!
---
I still do it once a week, but I do it on my private server so I can collect materials for making stable flux without having to fight over the enemies with other players. I'm guessing it's the same for a lot of people. 
---
I still get quite a few legendaries from it as well.
---
The June 30 date was mentioned by Bethesda.
---
It's been mentioned more than a few times on the PTS message boards.
---
Same. Or old tv shows that you had no idea they were that dirty. Hell, the Goonies? I had no idea of half of their jokes until I was much older. 😂
---
What’s your gamer tag? I help out a lot of newer players and have gotten them to past level 50. I also have a level 20 that I’m working up to 50 and we can just partner up low level like that. Or I can guide you with my main and back you up.
---
The last few times I nuked it I got almost zero High Radiation Fluids - without which all the flight in the world is wasted. I don't care about legendaries anymore. I have my "god-roll"  favorite weapons already and the only others I seek will come from me crafting Wastelanders legendaries. I get all the legendary drops I need from dailies and farming, so I'm never at a loss for scrip. What I NEED, is stable flux, and what I need for that is High Radiation Fluids. But that has become damn near impossible to get. I drop nukes on Whitespring and get 1 or 2 if I'm lucky. I drop on Harper's Ferry and the Burrows and get maybe 3. I drop on Morgantown and got a whopping 7; I totaled 11 after 3 sweeps through. That's still crap when I can farm hundreds of raw flux. The HRF drop rate had become terrible. I still have 70-80 glowing mass and hardened mass just weighing me down because I can't use them without the HRF.
---
Now picture it with a chaining effect like we have on the rifle. I think that would be cool, and even without it, I’d like to see it back alongside Tesla T-60, or maybe X-01.
---
I need to make an int to experience table for supermutants, but I agree despite being slightly more squishy unyielding is just broken 30+ in all stats is awesome.  Do need to spec in more defensive cards though when i'm out of power armor and I do die still fairly often.  Poison is less of a concern though.
---
Since perks were useless for so long, I tried building up full loadouts of only animated cards. Needless to say, that means quite a lot of them will end up wasted with legendary perks. They talked about getting one every 50 levels when they first announced it back at quakecon or whenever, so I assumed only my level would matter
---
I understand what they are going for, but this feels like a silly way to do it. Imo it should just be directly based on your level, the only reason they wouldn't want to do that would be to accommodate for people who used perk points to respec, but they already admitted that the current respec system is trash and a better one is coming later so that shouldn't matter either. I'm just getting a bit tired of feeling like I'm being punished for trying to have fun in silly, obsessive ways
---
I don’t know what to tell you. Every PC player has access.
---
How does one acquire said weapon?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Deliverer
---
Furious/Faster Fire Rate/50 Damage Resistance While Aiming, all day long, no contest. Try them both out and you'll see.
---
So wait, you don’t actually spam stimpaks, cuz I’ve got all the perks except born survivor 3 ive got it at 2  and it doesn’t resist as much as you did
---
I'd be down too. I lost my dongle for my headphones so o cant chat anyways. I have fallout 1st so private server is possible if that matters.
---
TrayzoB. Mdt
---
Edit: just found the fov/dongle
---
This is a great idea!! Also it'd help with badge drop rates as I've never earned any outside of the ones used to get my backpack.
---
I have a soft spot for the scouts in this game, it was a good decision by Bethesda to add this aspect.
---
I don’t want anyone taking my advice on this, because it’s simply what happened to me and I’m not for sure that it would happen to you. 
---
But the only way I was able to get all of them (except for yellow because I had to buy it for reasons you’re about to read) I literally stopped playing. I wouldn’t play for months. Not that I hate fallout. Just lost things to do and personal stuff going on in my life that made it to where I couldn’t play as much as I’d like. 
---
Every. Single. Time. I’d get on after about 1 month or 2, I’d have a rare color. That’s how I’ve gotten all of them (again except for yellow) 
---
Forest was the last one I have gotten. I got red before forest if that says anything. 
---
Again, I don’t recommend this unless you’re a psycho like me (hence username) but... if you are crazy enough.. then...happy hunting!
---
HarleyQuinn22 on Xbox. I’ll help any way I can, even with random aid and making you armor or weapons 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
And another level two safe upstairs!
---
Wade Airport in the hangars. Theres TONS
---
That's a very common misconception. You do not need wasteland whisperer to tame anything, only to pacify. I dont even have wasteland whisperer and have tamed atleast 3 different mirelurks.
---
I don’t think it’s a bug, I think it’s intentional, as all other prime receivers/capacitors are locked behind RNG from the queen.
---
I'm so disappointed in the water wheel. Aside from "it should have been a generator", which is entirely true, it stopped turning a week after they introduced it. I haven't seen one working since. Why does it take so long to get this stuff fixed?
---
M72 Gauss Rifle from Fallout 2, because the Fallout 4/76 design is awful. Wastelanders just adds insult to injury w/all of the *other* cool looking gauss weapons.
---
How long would you say it took you to get to level 100?
---
You don't know the half lol.
---
I have an assault rifle version of this and it rocks, I'd do what /u/mrfunday2 said and make a build just for that weapon if you don't already have one. Either that or you will get a LOT of stuff in trade for it to the right customer.
---
Look up data cache ps4 problems/solutions.
---
Sometimes it's just a problem with space.
---
Yeah sense than I've changed alot. Switch commando build due some extremely nice automatics I got. And I have been switching those out for vats crits and other damage perks and it's working out alot better!
---
I've been watching this issue and I think it's more to do with server lag.
---
On a friends private server the core empties much more than it does in a  public.
---
If you watch the numbers, they do usually go down to ZERO. But the moment the weapon goes to reload it shows the TRUE CAPACITY, which is what most of us are catching wondering why it's reloading with most of it's ammo intact.
---
I quickly change weapons and back to finish off the core.
---
If Bethesda cannot fix this bug (as I believe they are simply incapable of doing this) then the fix is simple. Let us combine cores! What's that? I have 10 cores with about 9/100 left in them? Let me combine them in a workbench to make an almost  full core. Or break them down into components to craft cores (Which I would love do be able to do with ammo let alone cores)
---
I actually don't go looking for legendary weapons, I just take what pops up or if I have enough scrip I'll try my luck, or If a player is selling what I want at a reasonable price I'll grab it.
---
It’s happened to me three times and I was talking to someone else who has also had it. I know at least one of the times I was able to get rewards from the event so at least there’s that?
---
Don't open them. If you get any duplicates beyond what you can store to have one of each rank of a perk, it will just be wasted. You also want to preserve as many animated cards as possible, since those give you much more points
---
There are two entire other consoles full of players. Both of which may have issues that could never appear on PC.
---
Anytime!  Really nice gun.  I used to run the same combo, gauss and plasma flamer and it’s very effective!  If you ever decide to try commando it will really shine there as well!
---
If I could I would but I have a ps4
---
yeah I got the event rewards, but I'd have to completely close fallout to do anything so I lost queens main loot
---
I'm always up for teaming, and prefer people who don't use the mic.  I like having multiple free fast travels, and often try to build stuff (nuclear reactors, weapons/armor, etc) for our lower level teammates.  It's also fun to do events as a team.
---
The HRF is the clincher--it's so much lower than the mass etc I feel. Literally my heart pounds when I see glowing mobs in a nuke zone... They're almost *rare* imo for a zone intended to be *tough*.
---
It's almost more (or as) worthwhile tickling ultracite nodes in the bog as I tend to get an HRF off each squad that rolls in because you touched their special area.
---
boowm!  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
Having access isn't the same as having active players who contribute to bug finding and reporting. Some people just want to see the new stuff and do nothing to help report bugs.
---
Ew no, why would I want to play that game? 
---
I love Apex Legends for fast paced pvp though.
---
heavy
---
Don’t forget to add the perk card “Scrapper” you get -I think- 15 steel from a scrapped mini gun? Pretty decent
---
Possibly. I thought I read right after Wastelanders dropped that it was unintentional. I could be wrong. Does unlocking the Prime Gauss Pistol unlock the Prime 2mm Ammo? I don't know any of the new Gauss weapon plans...I'm spending for SS armor.
---
I assume it will just do the dame thing as dailys when you do NW first.
---
Stay in the forest area and explore everywhere, loot everything and practice what sort of build you want to play, rifleman, heavy weapons (though you wont be able to do that till later levels), shotgun, melee, etc. Stick with the one you like and slowly build a character around it as you learn what works and what doesn't.
---
Stay on the left hand side of the map while you figure things out, oh and stealth is your friend, and will keep you out of trouble and boost your damage nicely.
---
might just try it for the first time since it launched...
---
I built a mothman motel and had Beckett in the lounge area wearing the cultist set. Looks creepy and cool. Actually wore the mask myself for a while.
---
I don’t rage but I don’t consider them to be real speed runs.
---
Also, the idea that if a bug exists you should exploit it, even if it gains you rewards you didn’t really work for, is a good way to get banned.
---
They ban you in Rust for exploiting bugs, they ban you in WoW for exploiting bugs, they should ban you in this game... and they have.
---
Also it just blows my mind that you would rather play a broken game that gives you easy rewards and not a challenging game where you earn your rewards.
---
But people on this forum complain about trivial things so...
---
Melee+basic power armor chassis early on is helpful because melee damage ties directly to your strength, and the PA chassis gives you 10 base strength and that's big early on. Plus, the PA gives you some useful damage resistance that you need. Even if you don't stick with a power armor build permanently, I'd say DEFINITELY use it the first 20 levels. Just my opinion.  
---
Pharma pharma perk early is great. Plus first Aid perk and Field Surgeon perk. Dilute your Stimpaks.
---
Also, for all weapon builds, don't max out each perk card until you have all of them (eg. Slugger, Expert Slugger, Master Slugger). The first point on each card gets you +10% damage, so 1 point spent on each of those 3 cards gets you +30%. BUT, if you max out the first card (eg. Slugger), since each additional point only gets you +5% damage, so you'd still spend 3 points but only have +20% damage (10/5/5).
---
I can tell you how many it's taken so far.
---
70 hours and no red.. not even a forest either
---
People do it on private servers so they don't have to compete for mobs when farming flux components. You can always launch you own nuke.
---
two shots have far less accuracy and break more often.
---
Anti armor is useless if and enemy have a low armor .
---
Besides, all low life armors effect/mutation/perks power up all legendary weapon types
---
Abusive relationship

Pew pew gun from new Vegas, name says enough.
---
Thank you so much!!!
---
Oh this is perfect! Thank you!!
---
Met one of my first in game friends through messages. He doesn't have a mic and me and my other friend were shocked he kept up message after message. Turns out he used the app on his phone, plus the in game emotes. We're in sync enough to the point where if we ask a yes no question and done see a thumb up or down..."oh he must be in loading screen..lol"
---
Looks like I got alot of friends already from this post so gl and have fun
---
I have not purchased any of the new gauss weapon prime plans, but have used the gauss rifle for quite a while so I had the plan unlocked before wastelanders.  I’m a commando/ rifle build so there weren’t any new weapons I really wanted outside of novelties.  The SS armor is amazing you will love it!
---
100% on the combination of cores! I would love that! Though they will never do that as it acquires too much effort. Whereas the original problem is a definite bug that needs addressed. It would be great if they addressed the bug and then added that feature, but I'll settle on them actually fixing something first.
---
Sorry I'm on xbox
---
Time to move
---
Honestly fallout 76 is pretty ‘tame’ in comparison to the other games. In Fallout New Vegas, fiends will straight up call you a b*tch while they’re fighting you. Not to mention the whole fiends quest line, with the &gt;!kidnapping and sex slaves!&lt; and all that.
---
I’m not on PS4 but a good recommendation for chatting with team would be discord
---
Yea I about stop caring about level at this point but now that legendary perks need so many levels to max I have something to strive for again. And yes it seems like seasons are gonna add more things to do but mostly cosmetic rewards seems weak to me there needs to be something big at the end or most people wont try to finish
---
Skyrim: Medieval Fallout.
---
Bugthesda ...... but meh
---
Honestly bethesda is really good about giving you the atoms if you put a ticket in when it happens.
---
I would use that fireplace door to really trick out my hidden mothman shrine
---
Its literally not
---
They announced from the start that DLC would be free. It is undoubtable that they figured out the financing of the game long in advance. If for some reason the monetization is not working out as expected (and none of us has any way to know that) then going back on their word that DLC would be free is probably a great way to absolutely destroy further purchases and goodwill. 
---
If you want to support the game and by extension Bethesda's actions as a company you should buy Fallout First, Atoms, and whatever season boardgame credits they offer.
---
Do you have a source for this?  I’ve used plasma rifles extensively and have many different ones.  I did not notice any drastic change in fire rate using an ffr with the flamer mod.
---
I would but I haven't played in like 8 months and really low lvl so you problally wouldn't want to play with me :(
---
Get the fuck over yourself and stop trying to police how other people raise their children jackass.

There is a banner for beaver scouts that isn't buildable yet.  I am hoping for a new scout level sometime this year.

When does patch 20 realise
---
Lol how?

What do you actually do in the game other than kill things for loot?

Hey any level is a good level! If you want, add me :) cutthroat_cass

If you are still looking for people let me know.   I'm CST and typically don't play with a mic as I rather text then talk to people.  Sapper1312

Sneak with light foot perk. Oh look they out punjis on me...oh and a radiation emitter... stealth suit no biggie...drop you've been insulted paper in bag and leave
---
I'm glad you are loving it. I've played this game since launch and it was very bad, than it got so much better and interesting and than went downhill fast. I've tried to play a bit of wastelander I'm two quest in and I had to quit it was missing something I can't tell you exactly what but it kinda felt hollow and more lonely than playing fo4 in sp
---
Laser RCW because laser Tommy gun.
---
I just want energy weapons to not be garbage
---
They're trying to initiate the vender steal bug that is still live on the PTS server too!
---
Always looking for new ppl to play with :) my psn cutthroat_cass
---
I stole the baby from the Dikini, while he was taking a pee pee.
---
You just contradicted yourself. You said its designed to be mass killing without purpose. Now you said its killing for loot. Male up your mind.
---
That would be cool (unless you have to find a sheepsquatch and then kite it to top of Tanagra).
---
Could even be a part of Squirrel to "choose your progeny" as there's now a kid in both Crater and Foundation.
---
If I'm not mistaken there is a party chat setting that translates party chat to text but I don't know tbh but you are more than welcome to play with me and whoever else is in the party. We mostly just hop events and mess around or vendor hop. But my name is rob-5430
---
Always down to add Vault Dwellers to run events and missions.
---
What can we do to not let it happen?
---
Sweet! I had no idea! My psn is cutthroat_cass :))
---
No standing there doesn't trigger this, it has to be a tent!
---
June 30th I believe
---
Dont keep your hopes up however, they did nothing when the vendors got messed and i lost my excavator calibrated legs.
---
I can see a few potential reasons.
---
A. They just want to PvP, PvP for some reason has been making abit of a resurgence, and when they realise you aren't fighting back they just check vendors then leave.
---
B. I have heard and read about some new exploit that allows players to buy whatever is in your stash out of your vendors. This could be part of it however I do not know for certain and I could be talking out of my ass like the daft sod I am.
---
C. They are just screwing with you. It's common for players to try to freak out/panick/concern other players for amusement.
---
Havent picked up fallout since a quick stint with Wastelanders. The world and ui, and general gameplay loop doesnt hook me anymore. Other games have done it all better by now
---
Love seeing new players. You gotta farm the type of raw flux you want from a nuke zone. Farm hi rad fluid, glowing mass and hardened mass from bad guys in nuke zones.  Craft stable flux at chem bench.
---
There’s a guy on YouTube I occasionally watch who does some cool shit with crossbows.  He’s made a repeating crossbow and even a fully automatic crossbow.  If only we had that type of ingenuity in Appalachia.  If we can make literal nuclear generators I don’t see why we couldn’t do that.
---
Everyday a new head is added to the wall
---
Sweet! My psn is cutthroat_cass
---
LeeroyJenkins032 - always looking for new people to run with. And I have the messenger app on my phone so messaging in game is super easy!
---
Raw flux spoils. Use the perk cards chemist and super duper when crafting.
---
You need to collect it from a nuked area on the map, violet is most plentiful in the prime fissure area, cobalt is must plentiful at white springs
---
People say it only works on people with exploited camps but that's just a lazy excuse, it is a lag problem and can be caused by them having a slow Internet. The only safe way is to not have a vender, but moving your vender upstairs far away from the spawn point is the safest place if you keep it!
---
F for OG Whitespring nukes
---
There's a mod for the bow that gives explosive arrows. However it is also possible to have a legendary explosive bow I'm pretty sure.
---
Lol the one and only Leroy Jenkins? :P
---
You have to collect the radiated flowers in nuke zones as well as hardened masses and irradiated fluids from enemies in nuke zones, then look under nuked flora on the chem bench,  I think.  
---
Most people now nuke fissure site prime, where the scorch beast queen is,  but to get cobalt and violet in a decent enough quantity you really want someone to nuke whitesprings or up north near the pumpkin house,  or Morgantown.
---
Hope that helps?
---
Bring back the pulse gun from NV. Make it wreck robots and PA users just like it did in that game.
---
My mothman camp has Beckett dressed in rags, prison collar and a clown hat. It also says 'twat' in lights on the wall with an arrow pointing at his bar.
---
Not the original but I shamelessly stole it and do what I can to live up to the legend 😂
---
Yeah you described exactly why PVP needs to be set up PROPERLY. I’m glad you’re with us on this one.
---
Yeah I hear you, it totally sucks. Amazingly this hasn’t happened to me yet in Scorched Earth ... I got it once in Encryptid and twice in One Violent Night. I guess until they fix it I just have to try not to die at the end lol.
---
I’ll be in a team with you leafeon_leaf
---
But that quest is constantly inactive due to poor planning. Its a pvp event that doesnt work, I’m asking for something that would work. Thanks.
---
First off you need a nuke zone.
---
Then you need to kill enemies there for High Radiation Fluids, Glowing Mass and Hardened Mass.
---
These dont decay but are very heavy. You will need 1 of each per Stable Flux.
---
Next you need plant matter. There are 5 types, yellow,  crimson, cobalt, violet and fluorescent.
---
You harvest the radioactive plants that grow in the area nuked and get a raw flux per plant. A pop up will tell you the colour recieved or you can review in the Aid menu. You need 10 per stable flux, Green Fingers perk works on this and bumps your harvesting to 2 raw flux per harvest.
---
This decays like food so gather it and craft reasonably quickly. Remember to equip the Super Duper perk while crafting to increase your yield.
---
No.
---
But next Tuesday, it will.
---
I’d love to be your teammate, add me at EmeraldDoughnut
---
sadly it's worthless just give it to me so you dont have that extra carry weight :/
---
hey! i’d love to play sometime my psn is dxn_lle
---
The game lacks a ton of stuff
---
Too bad PS4 :( I'm XB1 and I know sign so we could FT
---
Start a party with both of you (or whatever PS calls it) before you launch the game and then have one of you load into a game, and have the other join that game.  Ignore the in-game social menus. They've been buried for a while now.  If that doesn't work, the server that the first person joined might be full.  So, reload to a different server and try again.
---
And send this known bug to bethesda!  They need to be sent  this to remind them that it's never really worked.
---
this was made before wastelanders so imagine there may be a few things wrong here and there
---
Yeah this ones been around awhile. I usually get screwed at encryptid but I've also encountered it with the queen. I now equip one piece of life saving armour before these events. It has saved me but other than that it's leave the server and forfeit the loot. Sucks
---
Fluorescent at Whitesprings and Crimson....Cobalt is Morgantown.
---
My base is next to the drop site at cranberry bog 😭
---
Fast travel being in the game has damaged it since day 1
---
Ok you clearly want to be right more than I do. I don’t really understand how if OTHER PEOPLE CAN PVP and it DOESN’T effect you, why you would have a problem.    
---
Everyone agrees exploits need to be fixed. I never disagreed with that. But to remove pvp because a few bad eggs exploited pvp, is over the top. Imagine if they removed trading because of dupers.
---
That's not that big of a gap in level. I was able to kill a lvl 45 troll when I was level 25. Playing smart.
---
You have more than enough offers now, but I abhor the mic and just chat through ps message. Have a two year old so always afraid someone will start swearing ha. L1QU1DKRYSTAL if you ever wanna run nuke silos.
---
Hell yeah!!!!
---
The problem is, things like this make people wary, which makes people not want to explore.
---
My current camp is a mothman conversion centre, with literally nothing that can hurt/kill you and people are still wary to try it (I have a basement with successive keyed doors; the first room is pure vault-tec, the rooms get more and more mothman, until the last which is VERY mothman and has a vendor with cultist blades for 1c so they can join the cult).
---
I usually have to go through it with them, which is a shame because the point is that it's supposed to be creepy and WTF - why is there a hidden basement room and what lies beyond it etc.
---
I am constantly comparing real life items to fallout stuff. Like one time I was driving and saw this weird thing in the road and I thought “hm that looks like a frag mine”
---
Had this last night. My plasma flamer was *greatly* pleased.
---
Make a build! But if not I would suspect you could get any plans, masks, outfits ect you were looking for
---
Junkies commando with a side of vats non stealth is my recommendation. 
---
I run jetpack and emergency protocol PA (ultracite arm) with a stack of mutations and I'm not much slower than out of it but I can understand not wanting the clunk.
---
Oh and for the most part pistols are rubbish compared to the other groups. Except maybe non magic shotguns.
---
Shooting zombies in the legs to disable them so no more spawn in the event, therefore removing the POINT of the event is cheating.
---
Putting power armor down to block entry ways... yes... that is cheating.
---
As for the other examples... you’re pushing it to make your point and it is childish.
---
If there was a bug that allowed you to fall through the world and end up in some testing area with infinite ammo you could steal, you’d probably think it was fine.
---
Oh... wait
---
Also, devs will agree with me. I’m sorry but it’s just the way it is. Exploiting a bug that has yet to be fixed is scummy and you should probably play a different game because it is obvious you aren’t enjoying this one. If you have to cheat or exploit in order to have fun..l time to find a different game.
---
Killing people after they shop is hilarious, only because 99% of them cry about it in area chat. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
It’s priceless.
---
Feel free to add me, Stygian_Cultist. CST Timezone.

That goes for anyone that needs a silent companion. I'm a silent/solo player who would much rather communicate through messaging due to some intense social anxiety.
---
I'm also an idler/roleplayer, I enjoy following people around as a combat companion, or just livening up an area with an instrument, or just taking up space and the like. I've often thought about putting myself up for hire as mercenary and such to feed my need for RP while maintaining a comfortable silence.
---
I play no mic all the time. Add me - Bobbyfnshaffer

I'm on PC, IGN: Snapste1n
---
I had the same issue when I played rdr.  I would go on country drives. And the amount of flowers/plants I needed to collect?  Holy crap!  AND, I just happen to live in a region that has most of those in-game plants.
---
I know the feels. . .
---
He destroyed that mungo
---
My usual PA is my Ultracite with emergency protocols, calibrated shocks and a jet pack on the right arm.( I don't know why but it let me install it so I'm  keeping it!)..
---
My fave PA to prove a point to someone is my lvl 15 raider PA where the only things on it are Calibrated shocks and emergency protocols.
---
For the f*k of it I put this on for Sbq and it doesn't really matter what hits you. 
---
It's not so much the build, but a combination of three main things.
---
Emergency protocols + Nerd Rage + Blocker. (If you want... Serendipity is amazeballs if you have the room to add it)
---
E-prot will reduce damage by 50% regardless of armor level. Then once you have level 3 Nerd rage, and lvl 3 Blocker those percentages stack off the damage coming through the eprots. 
---
You can basically go toe to toe with SBQ  and laugh about it no matter what your build. I throw up the Heart emoji and just stand there for a few seconds.
---
The only thing worry about is mirelurk kings... and poison... and acid... and trolls..
---
I don't think that it's Overpowered, I think it's the realization of PA as what it was supposed to be... personal Tanks.
---
I get like this and it was especially worse when the vending machines were disabled.  I tried going back to The Division for a bit, I had been playing for months before Fallout 76, but the servers all feel empty. 
---
During Fasnacht, my daughter bought a Switch and a copy of Animal Crossing.  Now this is a game I'd never consider, but after seeing my daughter having a good time playing online with her friends,  and finding one of my own friends playing, I grabbed a copy and have been playing frequently since.
---
Now if there is any real point to this story, I'd say it is to expand your horizons (pun not intended).  You just might end up loving a game that's not post-apocalyptic.
---
You can’t wear anything on top of the CSA.
---
Theres no respec option beyond the current implementation planned for update 20.
---
So that’s why rivers give us dirty water
---
Personally, if they go that route, I’d like to see the pulse rifle come back as well.
---
Shhhh,  it’s soppsed to be a daily
---
Also, 930 hours isn’t any sort of achievement or something to be proud of.
---
It’s FO76, the worst game rated in the history of reviews. 
---
If anything, having that many hours in Fallout 76, a buggy, unfinished product that never works and has been panned globally... 
---
930 hours huh? Hmm...
---
Yeaaaa your probably canceling 2 realy good camp spots there
---
Should only be a daily. But nice 10 notes mate👍😁
---
Yessssssssssssssssssssssss FOR GOD SAKE PLEEEEEEEASE! I know the plans why wouldn't I be able to change them?
---
It’s giving you uranium fever 😬
---
Not gonna lie I bought in to Fallout 1st😂
---
Hello, I don't mind messaging to play with someone, I one time walked around with a random whole wanted me to join their team, no mic not even messages except cya next time we play, I just followed and help, in fallout I'm a stealth sniper build, and playing with others is fun, and right now I've got nothing to do in fallout but collect flux launch Nukes and help my friends,
---
Maybe. I’m on Xbox. I can’t think of any Xbox specific bugs but maybe you are right.
---
Female lvl 100 player here. I'm also looking for (female) teammates, the problem is i'm a little bit asocial/shy plus English is not my first language so it would be awesome to just write. I'll send you a friend request same name as here: RootsOfAstoria
---
as someone who is partially deaf and riddled with anxiety i'd love to lend a hand but saddly im a PC user.
---
on the bright side though in a week you will have random parties you can play with with or without the communication and no camp trolling or forced PvP :)
---
Goes to red lobster for Mirelurk vengeance 🦀
---
Hey if u need someone to play with till my psn is
---
xXMexSpartanXx I’m level 171
---
Gotta love these games 😙
---
Then I don’t know why so many people ask for a PTS. It was by far the loudest complaint here for a long time.
---
Excellent I will try that next nuke, just managed to run a reasonable whitespring nuke, that included one complete CTD, the error in my post, but did manage to get back to my nuked world, luck I'm thinking.
---
Anyway, time to try a different place.
---
Bloodied faster firing with +1 agility or perception (dont remember which)
---
Full health melee is fun.  Especially with the SS jetpack.  
---
I main a commando build but I switch to my trusty shovel in the low level areas and fly around smacking things.  It would probably be really fun if you actually spec into melee and have a good weapon.
---
Meeow!!
---
From one PC player to another... If you're going to sell on your vending machine, I'd recommend charging a lot more than 100 caps, especially for the colors needed for Secret Service armor Jet Pack mod (cobalt and violet). At 100 caps, you won't be able to keep your flux in stock. You should try to charge a price high enough to still get sales, but at a rate you can sustain supply of (depending on how much time you want to spend farming flux).
---
Imo the bomber jacket looks dope with the secret service helmet. Plus you can act like a pilot if your pa has jet pack lol
---
Thank you even just  the comment, I am honestly overwhelmed by all the outpour of support
---
I.P address, didn't think of that, could well be a problem. I'm also trying too run both game instances on the same PC so if mac address has any link to, who knows?
---
You can buy different types of mod for the crossbow, compound bow, and regular bow that give it explosive, poison, fire, cyro, and plasma arrows.
---
Regular explosive bows never existed prior to Wastelanders.
---
The mods are sold at Foundation and Crater once you reach a certain alignment status.
---
Duh, play Fallout 2 for the best Fallout experience you will ever have. Period.
---
If you want to play with trap bases, go capture a workshop (large area, large camp budget, doesnt affect your actual base) and get a friend to come visit. As long as you dont team up the friend is the same as a "random" player, so you can test what works and what doesn't.
---
Source: spent entire afternoon messing around with the advanced power connectors + traps to see what could be made. Result was realising half the power connectors dont work as described.
---
Scrapper perk FTW. Then just do runs through WesTek, Harper's Ferry, the Penitentiary courtyard, Morgantown Airport and Highschool, Uranium Fever is great.... Anywhere where the enemies use weapons. Scorched, Super Mutants, Mole Miners... I never have a problem anymore doing this.
---
holy shit that’s the best PSN name i’ve ever seen
---
First, find a melee weapon and role through Morgantown. Then scrap their weapons. After that.....
---
'that gun' from New Vegas... Looked cool sounded cool and was pretty powerful. (Chinese pistol) is my runner up
---
Hey I'm unavailable currently to play for a couple days but, I'm deaf too! I play on playstation if you wanna group up anytime! We can be silent in the group chat together lol
---
Wtf how teach me your ways
---
I have nothing against PVP that doesn't affect me and I haven't said anything against that  , go play pvp to your heart's content.
---
It everybody keep trying to bring it into the main game where it gets exploited and griefed to kingdom come that annoys me.  Playing pubic I can't attend an event without 1-2 idoits running around whacking everybody in sight purposely being assholes/ whispering insults  trying to either A trigger a defense mutation to start a pvp or get somebody to kill them to start a revenge god mode glitch.
---
Back to my point bethesda Can't provide secure online so it can't provide pvp, all it can do is provide a greifing platform.  The base code is full of holes bad.
---
Ummmm vending machines  they did remove trading  cuse of a "few" dupers hell the didn't even get all of the reported dupes.
---
Haha muties unite! We stand in... silence lol
---
Why aren’t you biking whitespring?
---
In all seriousness people are prob trying to get wendigo colossus would be my guess.
---
If you are in bright light like outside or under spotlights and such it sneak fails much quicker.  
---
Sometimes the game is laggy as hell and it doesn't seem to recognize when you are sneaking or not. Lol
---
I literally just went back and checked the computer log on Grant's computer after completing it and it started again. I've even been using the same dead body for the DNA lol
---
Wondered about this. It's the only one I have left for that Challenge. For the longest time all my Camden quests were borked though, thought it was related.
---
good job i don't pay attention to reviews isn't it.
---
Female here too!!  We can use a messenger to plaaaay! Even if its for fast travel or team xp it helps!
---
Yeah, I know what you’re saying. It’s been that way for me for the past 500 levels...
---
Yes girl!! Cutthroat_cass  hit me up :))
---
I hate 2 shot on pretty much everything.  
---
The Furious one sounds pretty dang good.  You can get a mod from the SS agent that is made for the plasma caster (can't remember its name) that turns the plasma rifle into an insane gun. It's the one that drains enemy fusion cores.
---
Afaik the generators all cost the same budget. So a nuclear reactor is the same as a small generator. Sounds like you're doing everything right. Scrap excess crops if you have any, or any resource generators (including brahmin) if you can go without.
---
Hail the mighty Caesar, son of Mars. Liberator of the Wasteland.
---
 *ahem* I mean no who would do such a thing...

That *seems* reasonable. It’s a major branch of weaponry.

Doneee!

Uh forget Scopes....

I'm not a console player, but is your ps+ subscription still active?

I would love to party up and help ya out I don’t use a mic much myself and if I need to I will message u pretty quick my psn is teddyxx365

Feel free to add me.If I am on, ill play.

PSN: Juggabear13

Exactly what does that entail? The quests everyones beaten already? PvP?

I hope they fixed the bug that stops crash landing from advancing if you log out after picking up the flight recorder...

I often spend 931 hours playing a game i don't like.

---
The point of radiation rumble is to grab ore and protect the scavengers. Stopping the ghouls killing the scavengers is an objective. If the zombies are incapacitated on the ground they're not killing the scavengers.  That is one of the objectives complete.
---
Maybe this game is too hard for you and you haven't got the skills to kneecap ghouls. Is that what it is? Are you jelly of my silky shotgun skills? Want some lessons?
---
Honestly if they got rid of reloading and had them act like Cores do in power armour I'd imagine it would get rid of the "illusion" of cores running out.
---
The ones saying the game is too violent are the overprotective, don’t let your kid near germs parents.

Actually trying to go for a junkie's bill due to a exploding Chunky's 10 mm submachine gun I got

I've got some buddies from up in Canada that I play with, they message as fast as they talk for the most part. I'm always up for playing without having to actually talk lol. Also CST
---
For some season exclusive cosmetics is all they need to motivate. Kind of like Raid armor in Vanilla Wow. Only a small grp will realistically reach it before the season ends.
---
My absolute fav sbq drop was a Medics FFR The Dragon...
---
Burnout. I've had it, still have it at times. It sucks balls.
---
Would love if you could eject out of your pa and cause an explosion at the cost of your fusion core and maybe minor damage to your pa.
---
If you are in the area when someone kills the scorchbeast queen, the quest reward is always some stable flux too. I believe its 3-4 random ones, so if you're lucky you could get enough in 3 kills or so
---
honestly, i have like 30 high radiation fluid in my stash at the moment 😂 i don’t have enough raw flux to create anything though
---
But have you tried *Sekiro???*
---
I didn't know that, thanks for the information.
---
Still do photo opportunity for treasury notes
---
thanks for this! i was planning on selling my for 100, but if i’ll still be able to get buyers at 200, i think that’s a decent price!
---
Oof I sent a friend invite just now before reading this so like half the message I sent is a little cringe now lol but we may stand in silence but we press buttons and controls mad fast lol
---
I’m conflicted about this. It shouldn’t be like that, yet I’m not interested in putting the time into NW as pvp doesn’t interest me.
---
Would you give a more detailed description on what you did?
---
OK will tommorow being it is midnight here I'm lvl 10 BTW
---
yeah, you’re right! whenever a nuke is dropped, i literally stop whatever i’m doing and i fast travel in and out of the nuke zone every 10ish minutes to farm 😂
---
I bought a one year sub last week.
---
Again.. what? I'm so confused what is your point and how does it pertain to the post?
---
I love the Ever Upwards quests even though the badge challenges were buggy as hell. I would love to have more of them for sure I like your ideas here OP! I would definitely like a flag and some way to display all the badges you have earned.
---
Btw....completing all the tadpole and possum badges was probably my favorite accomplishment in Fallout 76. No recognition, no trophy, no Xbox award.  It wasn't difficult but it took a lot of time and I bet very few people completed it due to the issues.  Anyhow....  
---
Ever Upwards!!! Bring on the squirrel challenges!
---
I use green thumb and walk around the nuke zone for 10 minutes and I’ll have so much raw flux. I find glowing and hardened mass fairly easy on bloated glowing ones, but for some reason the high rad fluids never drop for me. I craft ultracite 2mm for my gauss mini so I’m always running low on flux
---
Psn is thelonestoner88 
---
Join me any time. I message most of the people I play with anyway. Got 2 noisy kids so Mic is a no go most of the time. Lol
---
Resetting router is apparently how to fix it according to google.
---
Good shit I’ll have to go check it out. Thanks
---
i always have green thumb equipped :) one of my fellow players comes with me and we farm it together, but he doesn’t create any flux so i basically get double of whatever i’m picking up!
---
You're welcome!😅
---
Lol faster fire rate on a dragon?? Reload would be useful...
---
that would be sweet! but it would have to use your stamina and travel the same speed and no PA while riding 
---
just the look of it though lol
---
Ironically there seems to be a sad truth in this.
---
I feel like most FO1st members I talked to seemed to originally become 1sters to have peace and quiet from people trying to force them into PVP. Granted, at this point habit made most of us lazy, and the scrap box and survival tent are waaaaay too convenient to stop using them, but I feel like one of the main reasons for many was originally to be able to lean back and enjoy the game without griefers.
---
Always down for more friends to play with! I played FO76 when it first came out but my other friends stopped playing and I got kinda bored exploring the wasteland solo. Just recently got back into it this previous month and I’m enjoying it! 
---
CST time zone here

Psn: Yeezygucci
---
I'd like pickpocketing 2b enabled, and the cherry bombs added, just to wake up Ward! Was always great fun
---
yawn
---
ah sadly PS4
---
neah. plenty of them around
---
i've had 3 from maybe 10 events
---
Short answer: yes. Long answer: Flamers now deal flame damage on top of energy damage, and the only way to get any level of resistance to flame damage is by equipping fireproof. It's essentially equivalent to hitting a person with no armor on with a high dps weapon.
---
Ok, thank you
---
I pop em in my vendor for the base price and they sell.
---
I already did that and the ps4 as well. I also check the bethesda support twitter and there was issues with TESO after the "maintenance" to the servers and I dont know why but I think somehow they mess up Fallout 76 servers.
---
idk seems more trouble than it is worth for a few atoms .. I have launched one solo before and that scared me .. just never had any interest to redo it .. I rather let people who enjoy doing nukes do it instead ...
---
Just wondering why below lvl 250?
---
Unnecessary crops, turrets, flooring, and walls in my experience, have got to go lol, especially turrets, dear God!
---
Alright and thank you for the answer it was very helpful
---
RIP Unyielding Exploit
---
I would grind and pay juicy amounts for that idea.
---
It would certainly help being more independent. I feel like all my water-based camp spots are super mainstream and often already occupied when I join servers. But I also don't want to have my camps out in the nowhere, so I feel like water tiles would be an amazing idea, and could easily be added as a thing to be bought with gold like the dirt tiles.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
Cuz higher lvls have more experience but this isn’t my words, this is my teams as they are lower lvls :)
---
They finally fixed the respawn glitch while being overweight. 
---
But I love to see them fix the issue where you are unable to respawn if you die as an event ends, forcing you leave the world. Would be great to see this fixed.
---
And displays. It really adds up if you have a full magazine rack and bobblehead stand + any other display cases.
---
On second though 2 styles flat pools like floors/roofs  and the deep pools like concrete....
---
Me and my team are going to be farming the queen tonight, if you want to tag along with us
---
Ah gotcha. Just fyi when I was lvl 150 I fought a lvl 900+ and it was a pretty fair fight. Tell them don't worry so much about LVL. But good luck with your PvP search
---
So I posted an idea about adding pvp events (which could see those exploits fixed sooner if anything),     
---
And you came here to rant about how much you hate the people that exploited pvp.      
---
So besides your fear of GLITCHY PVP UNLEASHED ON EVERYONE IN ADVENTURE. Did you have any other in puts on my idea about PVP teams and Events?
---
The loot in this game does have no purpose. Stop being needlessly pedantic.
---
Feel free to add me falcon132011
---
I'm partially deaf due to a chronic illness! Just send me a message that you are from reddit, when you send the request.
---
Buy from settlers or raiders as somebody who has a main bow alt you only need 2 bows, learn comp bow plan, get fire and ultracite, fire for general and trash / crowd control,  ultracite for scorched and crunchier single target.
---
OH and glow sight one you have the bow plans they can drop in your loot pool
---
I sense a trap.  Like I approach the camp and multiple meat grenades get sprung......
---
;)
---
Check settings &gt; game display I think. Sometimes things turn themselves off
---
It is not a trap I don’t even have a single clue what those are
---
i’m fine with not using a mic, better with my hands on messaging lol, so add me when you can!!

---
Do you have xbox?
---
I got a 2 Star Cryolator that I put up for sale in my camp of my Shotgun/Sniper char.  
---
I have only found ammo for super cheap which is ok on occassion. The shotgun for this one is from the early Wastelander's quest where you can at least choose what kind of weapon you get.
---
FWIW, thats the same error string everyone was getting last week when the login servers were hosed for everyone.
---
There is video evidence of an owl stealing a tootsie pop from a small child. Been on tv forever.
---
Stick it in your vendor for like 500-750 caps. Might get a buyer
---
You literally can not buy this weapon, and you should not sell it for any amount of caps. It’s a trade only weapon. I would suggest you keeping this weapon for yourself if you every transition to a bloodied build. 
---
However if you do want to sell it, make sure to get a few good legacies for it.
---
Good Luck!
---
Im down if its not to late :) , just started a few days ago, im level 35 I think. Psn: Bluegunshot
---
Yeah, been toying around with it for a little bit to see if anything changes.
---
Not really a game breaking bug anyway, just annoying as hell lol.
---
Fellow lady here!  RottenRiku on PS4 I use the app on my phone so I can type quicker. :) EST but I have some odd hours; bit of an insomniac feel free to add me. I usually just wander and find players to give items to if I’m not on a task. lol I’m kind of a medic/bartender/food hoarder so if you need anything I’m usually your gal!
---
Totally agree, favorite activity. I have one scout challenge left: Robotocist. I cannot find Robot armor plans.
---
Level doesn’t represent skill, only time played.
---
(Not counting people who glitches there XP)
---
Though you do find people who play more tend to be better.
---
On the SBQ if she lands I never see the hp bar, but see it when she's in the air. Tried a scan/repair. Think its lag related at times
---
I took my dog for a walk the other day and saw a bunch of empty beer cans in a plastic bag on the sidewalk.  
---
In my head I said “Twofer!  Aluminum AND plastic!”
---
I did not pick them up.
---
Yeah my spawns are very buggy at WS which is why I left. Most of my mobs dead or stuck in the floors (PS4). They will fix after a while but I've not had any dramas since doing Morgantown. And the airport scorched replenish damn quick for me. Plus remember to do the cargobot event as all waves have mats.
---
I really need the one in the bathroom with 3 magazines.
---
Genius idea , definitely gonna try it
---
I mean this in the most honest, innocent, polite way. How would one best communicate with a person with a hearing impairment? What works best for all parties involved, in your experience? Obviously some sort of text chat, but what have you found to be the best option?
---
This. I always go there dip my berries.
---
If you wait long enough, you will be able to respawn. this shit happens all the time to me. I figured it out once when i threw my controller and stormed outside for a smoke, came back and i was able to respawn. wtf...
---
 I’m so lost, can someone explain?
---
just found it out almost the exact same way. came back after leaving for a drink and just happened to try one more time and I was able to respawn...god this game is stupid
---
Yeah I remember that. It took all day in order to let me loggin that day
---
Good to know, thank you. I'll keep the set up as is and look for other things to scrap.
---
Agreed favorite accomplishment. Although I have yet to complete Robotocist. I cannot find Robot Armor plans.
---
If you want add me it's killinyou212 must people I play with go into a party but hell idm messenger at all and totally understand the predicament your in have several deaf friends who refuse to play online cuz people always try to talk to them so ya hmu
---
There wont be a respec option anytime soon lol Bethesda wants you to grind spare levels and use those as respec. You're  nothing but a hamster on a wheel to them.
---
Thats deep 🥴😔
---
I made a upstairs bar on mine! Its a 4th floor with a pit in the center to watch people fight. Usually its just used for drinks lol
---
Never thought about this before, but I really like this idea!
---
You could create all sorts of bundles from weapons/armour down to specific med and chem bundles.
---
One of my main incomes in the game is crafting and selling BoS armour. Most of the people who buy, buy a whole set anyways, so I think it would be cool to wrap it up and have a full set of armour, or just 'something in general' just use up one slot in a vendor.
---
There are a lot more available since the xmas gifts. If you are on xbox I might have a few I can give.
---
I never use a mic so I feel your pain re: teamwork. Happy to run in a team, I usually try to communicate via emojis lol add reverendmatty :)
---
Hahaha thanks!!!
---
i play solo aswell made a some friends never used a mic (i have one) but i play NW with them and neever used a mic. If you want to play some NW or just adventure. i will send a friend request i will say that i m from your reddit post. i live in europa but i can play anytime now cuz i have vaaction. excuse me for my typos.
---
Exactly, it’s so frustrating running out of vendor space because I have all these different sets of Legendary armor for sale. Wrapping them up like a Christmas gift or a Miner Pail would be great for saving space.
---
What if they're messaging the owner if he/she will sell an item for less? I had a player (A) message me and when I replied, a different player (B) had just purchased the weapon, the other player (A) was asking about.
---
That's...very dedicated, ha ha.
---
You might want to eventually consider investing on mutation serum recipes, since serums require one flux to craft, but take up less weight in your stash and have a higher profit margin. Then you can just rely on the 4 random flux rewarded from Scorched Earth events to sustain stock.
---
For a junkie heavy gunner that's god tier.
---
i have marsupial serum currently! and i’m almost at 18,000 caps to go get another one 😂
---
i used to play 10 hours a day straight so i had nothing but time lmao
---
I respect that. I always hated when my high level friends just dumped end game stuff on me and basically said "now you have no reason to keep playing"
---
Hey! I mostly play solo, but if I ever see you around or see your vendor anywhere I'll definitely chill for a little bit.
---
Funny those are the same exact games I cycle through too!
---
I'll help you through a bunker. psn: mowitz! but I won't be on for a few hrs. need some sleep
---
Yep, you should be able to get a straight trade for that!
---
 I have the psn messaging app, so messaging is super easy for me, as it's just like texting my mum. But that loser doesnt play fallout 😂
---
If you still have the Crane sign up, but have done that part of e quest, take it down.
---
Switch to oil streetlights or candles.  Niether require power, so will reduce the amount of wiring you need.
---
Instead of running wires across multiple floor pieces to get to a junction box on the other side of the room,   power a floor/ceiling piece, then place tracklights or spotlights on the far edge of that floor piece to light up the opposite side of the room.
---
Crops take up a fair amount of space.
---
Check your stored items.  Delete what you don’t need.
---
experiment with power radiators.
---
Some people say it isn’t so, but subjectively, seems like I gained budget when I tore down my camp and rebuilt it with Contractor2 equipped
---
Hey! Your english is better then my, *insert your native language here* :) I look forward to your add!
---
I thought they wiped your talents before when they updated the game with major changes. Been a while could be mistaking myself for some other game through out the years.
---
Gah, team work is the hardest without a mic lol
---
FFS u/bonbennybon wrote “These people saying the games to violent are probably the same people who take their 10 year olds hunting” and I disagreed, stating the people saying it are the overprotective parents (paraphrased). There are a few people chastising the OP for letting a 9 year old play FO76. Still confused? 🤣
---
What’s your psn?
---
It does.
---
Thank you but I'm on PS.
---
Oh you're talking about the PTS update? I have no idea, sorry.
---
my native language is dutch
---
Good points, I haven't heard about contractor. I use minimal wiring, or as much as I can get away with. My house is small so two power radiators cover both floors and the porch.
---
I’m on PS4, currently playing Last of Us but I’m always down to just wander around and do stuff. Have a mic but rarely use it so not talking isn’t a huge issue at all. 
---
East Coast guy here
---
Both
---
Sigh nm , you really don't get it do you so this will be my last post  .. I honestly can't tell if your that stupid or just that willfully oblivious.
---
The glitches will never all be fixed they can't be fixed , e.g. the god hack has been reported and on yt for 6 months , bethesda has known for longer. No fixes are inc, they only fix the ones that are MASSIVE impacts or can hurt there take in transactions either atom shop or fo1st  the corp steps in and bumps priority.
---
I know personally of multiple dupe glitches reported to bethesda for over a year multiple times that are still active, plus more. I don't use them but I know they exist and work. I know a hacker friend of mine can launch a nuke 30 secs after logging in any time he wants too. 
---
 I 've been IT for 30 year hardware/software, not much of programmer but I can make software dance. The base code of 76 is broken and should of never made it to production but it was the most cost effective option.  I love the fallout universe I love the 76 universe , bethesda can go sit on pipe ... Pipe is life..... 
---
So again in small words so you can understand .....
---
Pvp will not work in in Fallout 76 because of Fallout 76 code. 
---
And just for reference .. I don't enjoy it much anymore but I  have played PC pvp since original DOOM on 4 player lan, So I do know my shit you young whippersnapper now get off my lawn !!!

I have about 100 of them

I really don’t mind chatting with teamates on text as I used to do it constantly when I was too shy to talk and didn’t know English too well . So I do (In a way) understand all the opportunities and possible friendships you lose by not being able to communicate .

None of my characters are at 50. This one just hit 25 today. I have Rifleman maxed and Expert Rifle at Rank 1.
---
On the PS4, there's an app for phones called PlayStation Second Screen. If you use it on the party screen, you can type and there's a voice that will talk in the party.
---
The .223 pistol(That Gun) or the 14mm. I know they'd have to add new ammo but I love their designs
---
I never use a mic when gaming, I’m too self conscious and I worry about creeper guys if it becomes obvious I’m a girl. Unfortunately I’m on Xbox but I wanted to say I have more than a few people I regularly team up with, even in nuclear winter and we do fine without mics. Good luck and hopefully you find some allies in here!
---
C4   always had fun with those
---
That’s what I thought. They mentioned it so I thought I missed something.
---
Thanks pal! :) it seems there is alot of  good in this group!
---
I'm on PC otherwise I'd take you up. It truly sucks that there's so many people who don't want to deal with having to type in chat. Hope you find some folks!
---
It’s an ongoing glitch with NW.  Once the time passes that the daily/weekly challenges hits, be sure to go into adventure mode before you play NW.  If you play NW first, you may see your adventure and NW challenges already completed but with no atom rewards.
---
I’m down to help you out. Wish you had people to play with like i did from the beginning no matter what problems you have. Psn: PhoenixOfLucence
---
They still can by abusing an exploit.
---
Dont worry about concern trolls mate, they either dont have children or are naive. I jave a 9 year old as well and allow her to play many games with me there.
---
There is much worse medium being flung around in school playgrounds etc and the more controlled exposure you can provide your child with the more grounded and responsible they will become.
---
Well I started a second character so I'll do photo opportunity on that one. But on my main, I've got more treasury notes than I need and bought all the bullion items I have any interest in. I could stockpile them even more than I already have for when/if something new comes out, but I still get them from other events anyway. If Davenport asked for photos of more things I'd still do it more on my main, but you can only take so many photos of Meg's face and the giant saw at Foundation before it gets dull.
---
I had no idea!! that is really a great feature they added. Thank you for telling me, however, my internet is super slow, that I think using second screen on my phone while playing, will blow my internet up! Lol
---
That's not griefing, then
---
Yeah good point I forget. I live in the US and I get infusions of immunosuppressants every other week so it's full distrupting my life. If you're out in public starting Friday it's going to be a misdemeanor if you don't have a face covering where I live in WA state so you can see my point of view 😉
---
There are dozens of us!  Dozens!
---
I have not but I'll look into it!  Thanks!
---
I think berserker should do more dmg. It’s a worse trade off than bloodied. Bloodied you’re a glass cannon sure but you would be way more vulnerable with no freaking resistances.
---

---
Hey cass i type fast so if u need a ps4 friend lmk.
---
It happens with other guns too. It's been a glitch for a long time but seems to have gotten worse since wastelanders. If you want to conserve your ammo and gun condition, another way to fix it is to just gun bash at the air. Of course it won't stop it from happening, but it'll spare you a bullet when it does.
---
Totally. Berserker would be a fun way to play if the risk/reward was set properly.
---
My guess is because that is what the screen tells them to do. If they have never participated before they probably have no idea about the recall keycard or the fact that they are about to get their asses handed to them
---
Since Nuclear Winter was released there has been bug that will auto-complete adventure mode daily challenges when you play NW matches. 
---
This is usually a negative, as you do not receive any atoms for challenges that are auto-completed. OP is making a joke that this bug will now be a good thing because you can auto-complete SCORE challenges without doing them.
---
Yes, that's a very good heavy gun.  50 ammo is cheap as dirt to purchase or craft, and FFR junkies 50 outs out a lot of punishment.
---
My primary weapon of my heavy toon is a JE90 50 and I friggin love it.
---
It's a bug, been a bug for months.
---
Wait is this also for Xbox?
---
Probably who don’t know about brain tumors
---
If only you were on xbox
---
What’s ur psn
---
That is one of the most valuable weapons in the game. Either make a character to use it, or save it until you decide which other top tier weapon you want to trade it for. DO NOT sell it for caps, it's too valuable. Congratulations :)
---
I just saw this recommended to me; I don’t know if you are still taking friends, but I’m on ps4 and hate using mic— I will send you my psn :)
---
That’s why I solo.
---
I don’t trust people.
---
:(( unfortunately, no
---
Moes are gonna moe
---
Because generally placing an item into a stash box even just before a crash/disconnect either leaves it on your person or in the box. Dropping onto the floor is always the highest risk for any situation where you wish to keep your gear.
---
Lol tweedleguns, that's a fun word to say in your head.
---
No this won't work. If we could trade PA chassis, this would be a possibility
---
Sure I'm down to clown around a bit lol.
---
Solus_215 if you're interested
---
I'd go as far as saying if you didn't use the recall card yourself, you shouldn't be starting it, period.
---
I blame my parents letting me play as Tanya in Mortal Kombat 4 as a kid for ruining my life. I get rock hard and scared for my life every time my wife wraps her thighs around my face.
---
Video games are bad for kids brains.
---
Unyielding + shadowed
---
I would totally be into it. I like bloodied because it’s a bit easier to die so it adds a little realism. So I would be waaay into popping a chameleon serum and rolling a stealth berserk build. But I once rolled naked with a berserker explosive sub and was highly disappointed in the buff it gave me. I don’t even remember what it was but it wasnt close to junkies and I think a few negative special points are easier to deal with than no dmg resistance.
---
Psn Zhious I can emote enough:)
---
Go play on your private server with your pve, carebear, safe space needing, people you call your friends.

No. None of the archery weapons can roll the explosion legendary effect

You win the event by breaking its programming. Got it.

Can you do the event organically or is glitching the game the ONLY way you can get it done?

Imagine somebody in bulky PA riding through the Wasteland on a Giddy-up Buttercup, maybe even with the riding animation from these camp ride decorations

---
I have the basic emotes, lol hope that's ok
---
Thank you for posting this! I’m going to dl the ps messenger app bc I don’t use a mic either. I’m a longtime fo4 gamer and do solo in fo76 when I have the time. It’s hard to find a team when you don’t use a mic or the ppl you do know are on a different platform. Lol- I’ve been trying to get the pioneer backpack for some time now and only have one quest left (revive a fellow player) smh but don’t know anyone.
---
I’m CST and psn is commander_bex :)
---
Easier to solo it if you have the gear for it.
---
You don’t need to pay attention. You use the internet right? How do you not hear of these things.
---
Please feign ignorance more.
---
My bow has the mod added to it and the card does work adding like 27 to the overall damage
---
I’ve had this happen as well. I’m thinking next time I’ll just occupy the computer and wait til a specific time. That way I control when it starts.
---
Hey, I'm always needing to be revived, haha so we could get you that badge in no time :))

Awesome and can’t wait!!

---
Clowning around in the clown outfit! Lol:P  yah,  that was a lame joke...  sorry
---
 it's bis for sbq encripted and other big beefy boss monsters or gimmicky bosses like strangler heart or if you are facing a bunch of smaller enemies in a "holdout" ie campfire tales for nuke clears because most heavy guns are low dmg high fire rate let all players tag monsters while protecting you from rads. 
---
 Tldr If meta, spedclearing with minmaxing overkill while maxing speed/sprint/ carry weight/stamina perks. And since power armor decreases base movespeed and its effects rely on blueprints instead of legendary effects or can someone be more dificult.

I just read your username lol...are you an Aussie by chance?
---
This is so cool! I love the name Pound Town lol
---
Unyeilding won’t make you stronger. It boosts your special stats, so...  More agility makes it easier to sneak and more action points.  More strength for more carry weight.  More luck for more criticals.  More intelligence for more experience points and better condition of dropped weapons.  More charisma for better prices at vendors and more speech check options.  The list goes on and on.  
---
The stealth suit has radiation protection.  Otherwise, I like my unyielding gear.
---
Any time girl :) add Meidara007
---
That’s exactly why I picked it! No deeper meaning or real reason behind it lol
---
Bolstering is completely unnecessary, especially if you're using a full set of Secret Service armor. You get such little benefit from the addition DR. 
---
I would not worry much about your stealth with a full Unyielding set. If you can get up to 3 pieces of improved sneak on them too then you really won't have to worry since your sneak. The benefits of a good set of 3* Unyielding SSA far exceeds the CSS, but the CSS is still pretty good (especially in nuke zones) and I wouldn't swap it out necessarily unless you get some really solid pieces. If it's working for you keep using it until you start rolling some really good pieces.
---
I feel this spiritually. My favorite gun in the fallout series is the humble pipe revolver rifle, and despite having tried a bloodied one, an instigating one, and an AA one, they just don’t keep up with other guns that use the same ammo. I pull it out only when I’m going scavenging in low level areas which is almost never.
---
Just no other gun compares to the sound and feeling to me.
---
It definitely would be considerate, but unfortunately you can’t put a “hold” on said weapon/armor while negotiating. The only remedy would be if I was near a stash box and was able to remove it from the vendor during negotiations.
---
Not as lame as most of the jokes I make, I'm sure lol
---
People do this to hold the machine for friends , if they know their buddy wants something they do that while the other guy hops servers
---
Yep. As much as I tend to focus on the 867 useless melee weapons, it really is sad that pipe weapons can’t be useful.
---
I only use one point of sneak on my build and still stay hidden. I also have 9 points of gunslinger in my agility column so leaves me very little points for my sneak perks.
---
 I use a ie pipe revolver rifle currently. Benefits from rifleman and gunslinger perks
---
Add me! I am new to gaming online and I’d love to have some girlfriends on there. My psn is lilybethuna
---
I feel exactly the same, I picked up Outer Worlds not so long ago and the other day when the Fallout Servers we’re down (I was gutted cos I took the day off work to play), I finished the story line and started playing it on SuperNova Difficulty and its awesome!
---
I just feel directionless in Fallout 76 now, this is my second play through level 85+ and I’m bored.
---
New wasteland friends! :))
---
It's like fallout with swords!
---
Sure thing gal! :))
---
Maybes I’ll try getting some light armors and seeing if I can’t shed a sneak point or two. Yeah I know bout that I have a completed collection of BE pipe guns and some time I like to slip on the gunslinger cards and take the revolver and bolt action out for some OP sneak kills.
---
There's higher levels but its probably god mode mixed with leadership bobble heads
---
Who is being pedantic? You said one thing and then said another. Do not blame me for the fact you eo not know what you are talking about.
---
The game is about survival. Sometimes survival requires killing to get the needed material. As opposed to a lot of shooters where you kill just because.
---
Shoulder mounted machine gun!!
---
Just like rumble yesterday, 10 people showed up me think this is going to be easy. Nope, all they did was shooting the crippled ghouls all 10 of them, None collected any ore even after telling them over and over not to shoot the ghouls and start collecting ore. Then I remembered why I stopped doing the event long time ago after I got the radiation barrel plan.
---
Some people just cant be fugged to type I guess 🤷‍♀️
---
Omg I went after the achievements on RDR2 and that is a fucking grind.
---
Beautiful game though
---
I’ll jump in. PSN is ctfeil
---
Try the game Prey
---
Psn:Gypsyfitz ,likes to run nukes , I’ll be on in an hour or so , I a have mic and run with a crew who likes to hit multiple nukes if you wanna pop over to party chat and join whatever server we dogpile
---
Multiplayer without text chat. Bethesda quit dragging your ass on basics.

As in. People review the game. I dont read the review or care about the review. I played the beta and lived it even then. All its flaws included. People had it in for this game before it came out. There was a 1* review on amazon for it. The reviewer didnt own a copy and had never played it but had watched their friend play. Oh yeah. I'll pay attention to that. Some other reviews I had the misfortune to learn of has quite clearly not played the game for more than 30 mins. My own pal said it was shit and he didnt even get to flatwoods. Yet he tried it again recently and loved it. 
---
Do you know what an opinion is? Ever heard of that word? Do you know what a review is? It's an opinion. By that reviewer. It's not law.

More than welcome to squad up with me and my friends anytime, my PSN is Jeffrey_Eps_Teen
---
I have that happen with the gauss rifle and it’s something to do with charging it. Mine doesn’t get stuck super often but often enough to notice.
---
The Bison Gun
---
A lot of practice social distancing, I see. 👍
---
I do have an xbox1 just no online for it and no fallout  lol but I will definitely add you once I get that up and running!
---
Shouldn't have split the gold.
---
Well I usually run to collect the ore and heal the Npcs when needed. And if we fail its because people aren't protecting the scavengers. 
---
Its not a glitch when it's a game mechanic that they added. Enforcer is a skill that exists. Crippling enemies is a legit tactic that exists. Why cripple something when i could kill it with one shot? Dont hate me because I play smart.
---
By devs/community managers?
---
Hey, if you can load ~30 food into a trough in six minutes in Project Paradise, you'll be faster than most of the randos that show up when I'm trying that quest.  Still haven't managed to save more than a single friendly ever :-P

They just want us muties to suffer in silence lol
---
Dont think I've played that event :( but I can sure as hell try my best!
---
Did you purchase Fallout 1st?
---
That player is small-time compared to [this dude](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h0lnf6/a_guy_one_shot_scorched_queen/).
---
Looks like you had plenty of people willing to play with you. If you need someone else let me know.
---
If you're using Escape Artist I know that's something that causes it. Got a stealth build that started performing fine once that card was gone.
---
I am amazed at the replies I have received, but just because I've gotten those doesnt mean i cant have more friends! Cutthroat_cass  :)) always happy to have new wastelander friends
---
OR...and I'm just about balling here... Fix the turrets
---
Sleazy marketing. Knowing it will be gone creates urgency to buy.
---
On the contrary, you can tune in at any moment to start a round with the incredible amount of people asking for pvp.
---
No wait - only app. 3 people actually want to pvp in FO76. Oops.
---
:O :O but did you know, he didnt hang himself?
