It wasn‚Äôt a mistake in the sense a visual thing.
---

---
If you read the update they say they realized it was way to overly ambitious.
---
They realized they were being unrealistic.
---
---
---
Yes awesome - loads NW mode, 10 minutes later waiting to join server, "fuck this, going back to adventure"
---
At a certain point you can‚Äôt say every single expansion should have been included at launch lol.
---
I don't believe I've ever had more than 100 concrete or cork at one time, it's no surprise that those goals were ridiculous.  It kinda shows how out of touch they are with their own game.
---
I think Raider glitch still works....
---
Because you‚Äôre dirt
---
If someone initiates it I will go with it. Let‚Äôs be honest that rarely ever happens in this game. I‚Äôm not just gonna go around attacking random people.
---
[deleted]
---
Lol and i will be wanted after that ü§£ but i might, if i don't want to deal with more mutants and shit, thanks!
---
Buy it 2nd hand, never buy atoms. All Bethesda gets from me is a slice of the necessary online connection fee.
---
It‚Äôs NW , everything is ok. Shooting grenades with vats , fu camps and ledge camp pullers it‚Äôs all fair game in the apocalypse
---
The most useful thing I have learned is that junk sells extremely reliably to end-game players, anytime my stash fills a bit too much I set stuff up for sale, get a few thousand caps and a free inventory
---
Thanks mate
---
I find that the legendaries from Radiation Rumble are consistently better, both in usefulness and average star rating, and can get 5-8 of them in 5 minutes.  I usually run my scrip out within an hour of logging, and my stash (vendors) is always full of scrip scrap trash legendaries for 10 caps/scrip...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If only they'd make more of the primary effects viable...
---
I‚Äôm on glass fibre @ 450Mbs and my PS4 is directly connected to the router with a LAN cable. It‚Äôs not my internet.
---
Last time I went to that bookstore, it had 146 burnt books and 119 textbooks just stacked all over it.
---
Because modders aren‚Äôt doing the heavy lifting for them.
---
My eyes....all those quests....
---
Do you know if new pics were added since like June? I saw it back then and I don't remember that skeleton camp item. I really want that.
---
&gt;Neither side comes out of this as a winner.
---
?? üëÄ
---
No one cares if you snipe or hide. The only scum are the ones that run explosives builds. It takes no skill to hit someone with a massive blast radius weapon. Sad thing is that even with the massive blast radius, the explosive weapons put out more DPS than some guns that require precise aim.
---
I get it to it doesn't effect game play as far as I've seen and I've had that come up on occasion for months
---
i had 113 mill in my scrap box i dupe everything to bad i lost my account
---
Yes we know... only been reported hundreds of times
---
Thank you. I am on PC though
---
With that, we agree. Still, it‚Äôs like 15 cosmetics, to them, are worth the same as all the content they‚Äôve already released, let‚Äôs say, after Wastelanders DLC which was ‚ÄúFree‚Äù. Let alone Fo4.
---
If you don't want to donate fine. This thread is not about you. This thread is about people who want to donate but are finding the map picked clean of all the concrete.   The map being picked clean means that there are people willing to donate, but not enough concrete to go around.
---
Check the event page now, goal dropped from 150 mil to 15 mil and is almost completed. We all knew how this was going to go.
---
15 is far more realistic. Even across 3 characters I was only able to donate twice because there isn't any reason to pick up concrete after I finished my camp
---
yup i think vats fixes it, still annoying though
---
Or maybe they‚Äôre discounted like every other Bethesda product for QuakeCon. Can you please explain how a discount = Bethesda bad? Oh wait Ik it‚Äôs because you are one of those people who attack Bethesda in every possible way because Bethesda bad even though you still play their games.
---
That's the truth.  Even our basic modders know our way around the creation kit and their engine than the devs could ever hope to know.
---
It's been updated: we are up to 12m, and they lowered it to 15m.
---
maybe, but most the jumpsuits look more rubber, no ?
---
Facts
---
no gastes mas lejos del juego, no cometas el error que muchos cometemos en otros juegos.
---
I went the Game Pass route but this.  As long as you don't give them your money, freely and of your own will as it were, it's very affordable.
---
Seems like the players have made an average of over 4 mil a day, so while it may be a bit of a grind I think it's reasonably able to be reached. Especially since players now know that the goal is, y'know, feasibly achievable now.
---
I just want Unyeilding reduced weight lol
---
That‚Äôs exactly the problem. They are discounted, but not at a rate that shows what truly holds value to them.
---
Did I really get downvoted just for mentioning pvp?  I just don't think the fixer is all that great compared to a legendary handmade, sheesh!  I really didn't mean to offend anyone!
---
If you don‚Äôt see the values don‚Äôt buy it. It‚Äôs not complicated.
---
Isn't cork even more scarce than concrete? That was my logic for saying it should be less than 10 million.
---
It doesn't show up as numbers, no. You'll just slowly see their hp sapping away. It drops off pretty rapidly though, so if you want it to be noticeable you need something with a high fire rate.
---
Basically the effect is working as long as they're bleeding green but not from the radius effect.
---
It is a shame that the Strangler's in its current state; it was well worth the work back in the day.
---
its a looter shooter...
---
I suggest you reread. I never mentioned the small backpack as the OP specifically talks Tadpole v Possum. The Possum backpack takes any Atom Shop skin as I stated as well as the Gold Bullion mods for chems (Raiders) or food (Settlers). It does not take the Possum mods bought from the Possum vendor machine.
---
The goal has been dropped and is almost completed.
---
This isn't cooking the books, they're not faking the numbers, they just made the challenge easier/reasonable 
---
Why you guys gotta make everything sound so evil lol
---
The gameplay for a verteran player in FO76 is shit. Simply put. This game was terribly thought out.   
---
What ruined fallout 76:
---
1. Duping
---
2. Removing Legacy Weapon drops instead of adopting it.
---
3. No dedicated pvp team working on balance. 
---
4. No team working on quality of life. 
---
5. No veteran gamemode. 
---
Without this the game is stale the second you hit endgame.
---
Sorry I only see this now and not on Reddit
---
[removed]
---
Wonder how many regular players there will be after Nov 19? Personally I've had way more fun with Fall Guys this last week :D . Prolly just chill there till avengers in Sept. Then ofc the one were all waiting for in Nov.
---
Its so disappointing, it has certainly been broken since last week. I experienced this with Carlton Mine and now on "From Russia with Lev." A week of waiting.
---
I can barely find concrete for myself!
---
I've had FIRST since launch, am a total materials hoarder, and I only modify my CAMP when it's a Legendary Run daily and only have 2,000 concrete.
---
Hoooooowwwww do we do this?
---
I have 16 concrete scrap
---
Goal has been dropped and is almost complete.
---
Why do people even take part in this BS event? You get explosives, alcohol, or maybe a weapon mod plan that you probably already have learned.
---
&gt;how badly the community didn't engage
---
I don't thinks it's that the community didn't engage, but rather that things like steel, wood, leather, cloth, and plastic can all be gotten just from playing the game. While thinks like concrete and cork have to be actively sought out.
---
Vendors sell bulk concrente. If you got some caps easy to jump around and get 250 a day to donate.
---
Is there going to be yet another currency? Or is that just you taking a shot in the dark?
---
I finally completed An Ounce of Prevention I can finally move forward with Wastelanders holy cow am I super excited about this.
---
Wonder what they‚Äôll do with the rest? Wood is the only one that seems likely to be achieved. Maybe glass or cloth.
---
Blocker has been suggested numerous times. So definitely going in.
---
CORK FOR THE CORK THRONE!!!!!
---
CORK FOR THE CORK FLAKES!!!!!
---
If you get enough people doing meditation the enemies are almost non-stop.
---
I run circles in Morgantown, 7-10 minutes each round nets 15-20 of each stabilizing agent per player, minimum.  By the time I come back around, the beginning is respawned.  Then there's Collision Course (15-30 extra scorched), Back on the Beat (20+ extra ghouls), and you can even get a Feed the People for another 20+ extra ghouls.  All of this without the hassle &amp; lost time of relogging.  
---
I do do this in a team of at least 2, and we can both one shot all of the enemies, but our experience is that Morgantown yields better and more consistent results, with less waiting.
---
Sorry meant  [Serendipity](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Serendipity). Also telling someone to get good when most players don't even attack my workshop and the only ones who do are try hard pvper's with full set of pvp gear and overpowered builds is a bit tone deaf. I find pvp in this game boring and broken, why would i try to get good at it?
---
I rather just go to a different server and start a new workshop there because god only knows the person attacking the last one is a fallout 1st member who safely harvested their materials and doesn't actually need scrap to repair weapons and armor like i do.
---
If the real Todd played just 10 minutes(feel like I'm being generous) of 76, I feel like some people might be looking for a new job.
---
You need Fallout 1st for it
---
and I am NOT spending a dime on it
---
how do you know patch 22 is going to make it better?
---
It appears they have reduced the concrete required to 15m. The tracker has been updated
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
..implying this isn't the same thing as autocompleting it.
---
You don't ask a toddler to play in the NFL and then suddenly make the end zone 5 yards away as a "solution".
---
Marsupial is a staple haha. Gotta be on all the roofs.
---
I went onto my private server and claimed all 5 workshops with concrete and hit up some of the big loot spots, and managed to save 500 concrete in a couple hours while I was on.
---
This one is rough so I'm hoping that Bethesda sees how much people were able to do with concrete and adjust some of the other harder-to-get items too to allow us some hope of getting the larger prizes.
---
I personally don't care about the drop boxes (in fact I was so exhausted from playing until 5am this morning that I accidentally clicked on Drop instead of Use and burned the two boxes I earned...lol).  I just want to get the overall prizes.  I could take or leave the provision boxes.  I want more meat!  lol
---
PS:  JUST went to the Bethesda tracker and it's showing 15 million as a goal on the bar and that we have 12.53 million concrete submitted.  Did they already make the adjustment???
---
zipper
---
I posted my build pre-defense. I meant to add it ino the main post but somehow forgot.
---
An accounting error was found meaning we only needed 150,000 concrete. Congrats we did it.
---
If you are on Xbox, use the lfg. Usually find people saying they are about to launch.
---
I knew they'll never let us fail, even if we didn't do anything at all.
---
Yeah -not a lot of players know or remember the house of burnt books.
---
Sure! Are you dropping. Or want someone to do it. Or need help?
---
You created unbearable lag now. How can you break so much by fixing something that didnt effect anybody?
---
I haven't used PA. What is ricochet?

- Small Backpacks: A new type of Backpack, the ‚ÄúSmall Backpack‚Äù has been added in an effort to help more players acquire a Backpack earlier on during their Appalachian adventures.  
---
- A Plan to craft a Small Backpack can be found inside the Overseer‚Äôs Cache inside the Morgantown Airport Terminal. This Plan cannot be traded, sold, or dropped.  
---
- Small Backpacks have 50% of the carry capacity provided by a standard Backpack.  
---
- Small Backpacks can be equipped with all the same Mods as a standard Backpack.  
---
- Players can still learn to craft Standard Backpacks by completing Pioneer Scout Quests.

üòê
---
Hell yeah let's bomb her
---
Rather than people just donating supplies there needed to be public events that contributed to the overall delivery of resources. Something like Radiation Rumble where you collect ore while fighting off waves of enemies or Uranium Fever where you protect extractors (we could have been protecting the robots currently building Atlas). 
---
Whenever the public event is successfully completed, the results would then top up the overall delivered resources. You could also treat it like Radiation Rumble where there are tiers of success which would increase the delivered amount even more (i.e. if you kept everyone alive and collected enough resource X or none of the extractors broke down during the event). 
---
Reward people with plans, treasury notes and all the other normal things (I'm personally not a fan of alcohol as the reward). Someone else suggested lunchboxes, which sounds good to me.
---
The overall community reward should been tiered too. Have an easy minimum amount that the community needs to reach to get the beret (or something similar) but if the community manages to get double or triple the required amount, then reward the community with more/additional special items.
---
Anyway, those were my thoughts.  When I first heard about Fortifying Atlas I assumed it was going to be new public events, not just a box you drop stuff in.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it does, it‚Äôs a weird gun, all the gauss weapons are, they technically are ballistic but are also energy. I had a gauss pistol and wasn‚Äôt doing much damage, I took off grounded and was doing way more
---
Simple answer: a studio that is new to this genre, and an engine not designed for this type of game.
---
What truly holds value to them is our money.  We have it, they want it.  We're lucky they don't know where we live ;)
---
Well i don't really know, but patch 20 had better performance overall.
---
Hahahahahahahaha
---
Game ran fine for me when I played today.
---
Should have been nice to the dupers, they could have completed this challenge solo
---
The game already throws so many free items at you as well as enough atoms for occasional shop purchases (sadly 75% less since patch 21). But some people will always want more and they are free to do so, but I'm here for the gameplay not 100 skins I'll never use, or new camp items very week that means you have to ditch something else.
---
I must have glanced over Serendipity. Seems too good not to take.
---
I'm confused because the progress bar currently shows 12.5M/15M for Concrete but the events calendar clearly says 150M. So did someone add an extra 0 or was the speculation that it will auto complete regardless correct?
---
Go check out Morgantown high school. There are a bunch of plastic pumpkins in the gym.
---
&gt; When Bethesda calls cosmetic DLCs "Content Bundles" it really goes to shine how undervalued actual content is 
---
People have been screaming that cosmetics are content since the game launched. So I don't get the complaint here.
---
Yeah really annoying, especially in NW.
---
Finally, someone with the guts not to shit on Bethesda
---
If you're at 25k+ caps and need a cap sink you might as well. And now that they lowered the amount needed to complete the event it's worth the cap sink. Not like there's anything to spend caps on otherwise, anyway. Caps are worthless in actual trades since everyone uses alternative items as currency, not caps.
---
It effects all gauss weapons
---
I feel like they must have based their numbers on how many people have 76 installed and not how many actually still play.
---
You don't get more perk slots, you just get a boost to special. You can see the bonus in the first tab of the pip boy.
---
2 tyoes of magic shottys
---
Damage Magic shottys need either the bonus bash damage perk or for you to wear one armor with the damage reduction when blocking perk. From there, vats hits will one shot most mobs and do mega damage against the rest
---
Vats sniper magic shottys can be any combat shotty, even non-legendary. Mod it to an auto receiver and short barrel and anything else you need to drop the range into the negatives. Once you have a negative range, vats hit chances will be maxed out most of the time. Especially useful when mixed with concentrated fire and enforcer to insta-cripple any limb you need. Great for forcing scorchbeasts to land
---
Also yeah gauss weapons are all explosive ballistic and energy
---
Holy Jesus. Straight out of FO4 concept art! It‚Äôs beautiful! What platform are you on?
---
todds got your money now sucker
---
Oh, thanks for specifically answering to my post to let me know, in this case I would suggest [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f38755c&amp;d=sw2s22sx2pq1p00l71ls2lt2lu2a04ib4c72cu2eh2ej4sg2sf2ll0&amp;wp=w8), I don't really know what you can do with the last perk point I would probably just dump it into concentrated fire to further increase accuracy on long range shots
---
Not a public event, but the daily "Heart of the Enemy" doesn't really seem to be a daily. More like every other day if you're lucky. 
---
I know it was patched so you couldn't repeat it as soon as you finished it, but I think they broke it a different way.
---
r/hedidthemath
---
even if they gave us something other than caps, say "donate 10 plans and get 5 scrip" or something   
---
just I hate picking up 19 Mole Miner gauntlet plans from Uranium fever only to trash them because everyone has it and no one even wants it for free
---
Okay guess I‚Äôll have to think twice about the mutation
---
&gt; This further proves Bethesda doesn‚Äôt thoroughly play their game, they don‚Äôt know how hard it is to get concrete. 
---
Most vendors will sell bulk concrete in packs of 10 that give you 150 each.  Two packs gives you 300 which is enough for at least one donation a day.
---
In my buying experience, I'm looking for Acid, Gears, and screws. 
---
As a seller, what junk items do you see people purchasing most?
---
Okay thanks for testing it
---
On the golf course at the whitespring you‚Äôll find a group of mad lads that were using golf carts and flag poles to joust
---
Makes no difference to Gauss shotgun or minigun, they use shotgun and heavy perks, that's what they class as, have tested :-)
---
The offense is made and you will never financially recover from this personal attack. 
---
Are you talking about a legendary fixer or just the standard one?
---
I can appreciate that pve experiences the vats bug too now (much less so however), but that doesn't really nullify my point that they're starving my portion of the community of content and implementing this scavenger hunt crap no one wanted instead.  I will also insist that fighting in workshops is not grief.  Stealth is a viable strategy in pve so why not in pvp?  I just don't get preferential logic like that.
---
This is fantastic
---
Ah I got it. You are just mad that every single cosmetic isn‚Äôt free because they have to ‚Äúmake up‚Äù for fallout 76 being bad at launch even though you still play it a lot. And you say everything should be free to ‚Äúmake up‚Äù for that even though they already have with all the free updates and dlcs they have given us that pretty much any other company would charge for. However that excuse is just a flimsy veneer you use to convince yourself and others that you aren‚Äôt just begging for free stuff and throwing a tantrum because you deserve the free stuff and are better than the people just begging even though you are doing the same thing.
---
I didn't know this even existed until some random awesome person in my public group was like, "Why don't you just check the holotape?" and I was like...ummm...what?! 
---
It's been a time saver for sure!
---
guess it‚Äôs time for another ‚Äúpls give mannequin‚Äù post. what are we up to now, 703?
---
Gt?
---
Ohh that sounds contradictory to what others are saying. Confusion amplified
---
Get scaly skin if you don't already, also with full class freak if you don't have a build aimed for max damage you might be able to get away with having grounded still
---
Gt? Mic?
---
That sounds amazing! I need to find me some gourds to plant haha
---
Thank you!
---
I just accidentally lost my marsupial mutation because i forgot to equip starched genes after getting rid of pre existing ones.
---
The idea is understanding the value of making a game which is good, which they‚Äôve had - and that cosmetics should never invade your game like they have.
---
I mean they grossly overestimated the communities willingness to give up scrap for junk and a few plans 90% of the community has already...
---
Not true
---
The concrete requirement changed to 15million we are at 12.5million
---
Did we somehow time travel back to when Fallout 1st was announced?
---
Again I shall repeat - OP didn't mention Small Backpack. The Tadpole is exactly the same except double the base capacity.
---
Yes you are right, but that's not what I meant. When you get a boost  to SPECIAL it should show " + 6" on the perk menu menu (e.g. STR + 6) and if you check  the video it shows nothing
---
Fr what was bethesda thinking with 125M??
---
I have both, my numbers don't change with or without the mutation...
---
They experienced a reality check.
---
It's funny if you scroll down on that page the original number is still down below.
---
They were really kind of nuts on this and several of the other ones as far as numbers go.
---
Acid and springs are the top two from what I've seen, gears and screws are close, nuclear material also sells surprisingly well as does black titanium and ultracite, the one junk item you absolutely can't sell is bone, nobody has bought it off me, ever but I can see why
---
Why would it be a player community fail when Bethesda clearly doesn't understand the rarity of Junk items?  Players have to actively search for Concrete instead of being able to obtain it throughout their travels of cleaning up the wasteland.
---
I used an energy weapon bobblehead and it didn't effect the gauss shotgun. It's not an energy weapon so i would ASSume the minigun doesn't count as one either. Try it yourself. Get a bobblehead.
---
Xbox here, GT is HeroKunning!
---
gotcha, thanks. fingers crossed!
---
Dude. Not at all. I never thought anything should be free. I just believe 15 cosmetics shouldn‚Äôt have the same price as the base game, which I like a lot and believe is actually good.
---
Going to run some nukes to block progress on it
---
Aw man, I‚Äôm PS4. I‚Äôd love to see more! Maybe I could bring some sort of equivalent to my platform :-)
---
Is it all accessible?
---
Also, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll have some fun with that airplane generator when it comes out. And the fusion flea stash would look great out front!
---
Terrible in vats. More bugged than other weapons, it is good with free aim . Grounded effects it and it is viable (soloed an sbq, so I must be doing something right).
---
The OP was asking about the difference between two skins. The Possum and Tadpole backpack are both *skins*. They have no functional difference. I can't spell it out any clearer for you..
---
wow thank you so much this is the best most detailed guide I have ever seen, so helpful!
---
Have you checked its not been hotfixed away? Some Magic has already gone quietly without individual patch notes and it's a good bet others will also slip away over time.
---
What's a food build?
---
And all the plastic plates, silverware, and trays in the cafeteria. Where I go when I need to make plasma cells.
---
That counter says 12.53m out of 15m
---
Are we sure the 150,000,000m isn't just a typo?
---
R u gonna nuke her or do you need someone to do it
---
They knew no one has that much concrete.  Not even dupers.
---
They need to make it more interesting like how about there‚Äôs a disease there and we need to donate to make a hospital ...make a story out of it damn!
---
I refuse to pay for something that should already be in the game
---
it isn‚Äôt really worth $100 anyways
---
According to the great angry turtle they are still working. And shotgun which is still working too.
---
I saw mine for the first time just now and came here to see if anyone else already spread the good word hahaha
---
Someone had done some number crunching back in this thread where the basic jist of it was showing an average number of junk donation needed for every player to donate to complete the event: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i0z94h/the_math_on_the_atlas_goals_some_tips/
---
Previously for concrete the number was 300 concrete. That number is significantly reduced now that the goal is reduced by so much. In all likelyhood, you could probably hit your lone player donation quota (just 1) off literally just buying NPC vendor bulked concrete and this event would complete itself no problem. This story will probably be the same with cork and the other junk materials, but we will have to see how those play out.
---
Other than the spot 20% of the player base seems to like in Whitespring, there‚Äôs a decent spot south of Vault 76 on the way to the wood mill.
---
That makes more sense, modding stuff.
---
Yes it stays, if you log into a different game where your camp spot is unoccupied it will be there
---

---
could be different for the new gauss weapons but in my experience it affected my damage
---
server latency can have a large impact.
---
I only hate m79 and auto grenade launcher people.  Specifically from roofs, snipers are cool though.  I do it myself as well, just from building not trees like a wendigo.
---
I can solo nuke Im a lvl 110 bloodied I just enjoy the company lmao
---
And golf balls and plates and bowling pins.  The high schools are both treasure mines.  Not a bad haul in Fort Defiance upper floors either.
---
Great, so I‚Äôm not crazy!
---
Yeah. I think it's just my kind of crappy Wi-Fi in the room I play it. I'll run an Ethernet see if it works.
---
Incredibly annoying bug, seems to trigger more with some guns than others (gatling gun and .50 cal both seem to trigger it a lot for me).
---
Sprinting seems to fix it without needing to switch into 1st person.
---
This would be awesome, I love the idea!
---
Its 15 million?
---
Thanks!
---
Well its almost done and it was only 15 million
---
Ive had this for a very long time too
---
You'd be surprised how big a base fits into the stream valleys, looks cool too
---
Where have you seen that? I've never seen that feature in the game, and I don't really understand how that would be useful when you can check special elsewhere.
---
yes the scrib can be the new ammo converter with his own cap limit. Even if its an extra 500 worthless caps ill take it.
---
I have like 23,000 cloth from pre war money in Collision Course alone.
---
BOS ain't getting it, but I got it.
---
Of course they want us to unlock it.  They made the things already and if we don't unlock them...well...it's not like they have any other use do they?  It would mean that they spent time (that is to say, money) on making things that no one got because they a) were too dump to check their own internal analytics to derive actually achievable numbers, b) they didn't check their player count and picked the numbers that the actual player count couldn't possibly achieve, c) didn't realize that steel is absurdly simple to get and the other things...are not, d) didn't realize that the rewards on offer pales in comparison to the value/difficulty to obtain of the resources or my favorite e) all of the above.
---
In any event, actually watching us fail would waste the work they have already paid for, expose them as out of touch with the community and cast doubts about the size/engagement of their community, none of which would be good for them at all.
---
So, they could let us fail (very bad for them), simply lie and claim we succeeded (pretty bad for them as it would be very obvious) or lower the bar to 10% of the original figure and hope we managed to squeak by, possibly with some last minute fudging on their part (best of the three as they don't end up looking quite so bad).
---
So, I see no particular reason to be grateful to them for doing what is, after all, best for them.
---
The real question is...when they lowered the bar for concrete...did they lower the bar for cork?  Or will that surprise them too?
---
5 plans gives a loot box with a reasonable 
---
chance for outfits.
---
But they're wrong also...
---
Yeah I'm a 1st member with like 5 characters and I think I have like 600 combined from all my characters and no way I'm donating it and having to collect more now that I know it would be a waste
---
It burns!

PANIC OVER BOYS WE GOT THE CONCRETE
---
Any.  Stealth only works versus NPC'S and the +1 agility provides arguably nothing.  A smidge more ap for vats but... Guess where I'm going with this.  At least 556 can be made at a decent rate and fired by the 30 rather than 15-20.  And as to making fun of my reaction to being downvoted for mentioning pvp, just imagine you were always getting your nose rubbed in piss for playing the game the way it was made.  That attitude sucks, guys, but I guess you wouldn't know.  Just stating facts here.  Prove your toxicity if you must. ü§î
---
In fact they're talking about Guass rifles, not shotty or minigun
---
So was 200 million steel a typo?
---
They changed it. We have 12.53m out of 15m. It suddenly seems more attainable lol
---
The Fusion Flea is actually stuffed up on the roof under a staircase :)
---
Basically anything save bulking that was in the game at the start works with super duper. Some things  added later don‚Äôt.
---
Morgantown highschool I farm it regular for 160-190 plastic with the scrapper perk, it basically fills most of my build needs if I farm it once a day.  Then ammo smith perks maxes out shell production (21) per craft for me.
---
I always used to go to the top of that really tall building in Morgantown kind of close to the school, but there's not much cover so I switched to trees. Not as high but very difficult to be seen.
---
I also hate grenade launcher people, and explosive builds in general.
---
Some players don‚Äôt have the amount either which hurt I saw they dropped the amount needed without saying anything... I think if they did a small amount of script or gold for rewards for players people would be more happy to donate or even a different loot pool of past event items. I donated 1500 concrete the rewards you get are not really worth it and are not worth the trade which for the amount you need to donate.
---
Yep. Right out of your arse.
---
Thank you for proving my point.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gourd_(Fallout_76)
---
Im refusing to donate because I can‚Äôt get enough of it and would rather hold unto my limited supply.
---
I assume Smiley is fixed?
---
I make it my personal mission to tea bag all m79 and auto nade launcher users üò§
---
Yes, I'm a dick. I just have a 12+ inch hate boner for those weapons
---
Did the monsters stop despawning. I had a round where the ghouls all stayed as corpses instead of meat piles and it tanked my frame rate.
---
Im refusing to donate because I can‚Äôt get enough of it and would rather hold on to my limited supply.
---
Final Word is awesome
---
The oopsies we may have added an extra zero by mistake our bad.  
---
I am still skeptical if it will reach that, concrete is one of those that people don't hoard and just keeps a few hundred tops.
---
Holy shit that's hilarious
---
I couldnt get the survive in storm challenge completed. Tried in three differant matches. Maybe its bugged for me.
---
Indeed it is. Salute!
---
Funniest thing I've noticed, some die straight as you're entering &amp; some die a minute later.
---
I believe you have spawned into the area where it hasn't been 20 minutes for said enemies to respawn but for some others it has (you interrupt its respawing process)
---
So they're there but then the server registers they're meant to be dead.
---
Trust me, I'm right :-)
---
yes - at least nerfed - hopefully the card is just broken the way adrenaline was after the last patch and they will fix it  - I mean, EVENTUALLY i can cripple a ghouls legs, but a 30% chance or whatever with rank 3 enforcer should be crippling a limb every 2 shots at most - explosive shotgun or not.  After this patch I am usually killing them before I cripple them, even max lv ghouls using very low damage shotguns.  I would love to know if anyone has submitted a bug on this - it may be the card is broken not nerfed...
---
I swear we were supposed to get 150,000,000 before and then I looked today and it‚Äôs 15mil, they totally dropped it. Praise be to Toddüôèüèº
---
Clinetside means console commands right lol
---
Hmm now that u mention it I think experienced more on my heavy gunner build than my commando build. Was just in NW with a 50cal and it happened.
---
Look it up on youtube
---
Yes, but that's not the point
---
If you need to farm for plastic, go after super mutants or anywhere there are BOS corpses. They both seem to have about a 50% chance of having some type of Laser weapon and are a great source for "Molded Plastic".
---
Maybe they shouldn't have set it so high in the first place? We don't have hours to waste on this game to find concrete. That boot must take pretty good lol
---
It‚Äôs awesome
---
I sure wish they would lower the amount of times i have to click on a location before it'll let me teleport.
---
Those gutsys that shoot the armor piercing rounds.
---
Unyielding works, I play on pc (win10) you need to check your specials, not perkcards
---

hopefully  [u/valseek](https://www.reddit.com/u/valseek/) , [u/Ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/Ladydevann/) can comment on what happened here and let us know...  this is a big help to my builds where I use shotguns as a sidearm.  it is a huge help in events to tag enemies without killing them, and not to mention crippling large mobs en masse is one of the more fun things in a group - it is a riot.  I'm not sure why they would nerf something like that - maybe in anticipation of giving limb dmg back to SBQ?  personally I'd rather have enforcer work and let the SBQ keep her limb damage invulnerability if that is the choice we have to make.
---
Haha well it‚Äôs a good thing I‚Äôm still trying to roll a junkies gauss mini. I don‚Äôt run bloodied and got it twice so I‚Äôm a lil depressed mats went to nothing. Don‚Äôt wanna do that with serums
---
I never seem to get the auto grenade launcher, which is fine with me because it hate using it. Give me a lever action or an automatic handmade and I'm set
---
The idea, their idea at any rate, is that making a good game takes years and years and the revenue drops off precipitously after a month or two.
---
Bethesda, and everyone else, would prefer to make a game that people buy and then pay and pay and pay...forever.  They would prefer it, of course, if the stuff that people paid for after the initial outlay didn't cost them very much money to make.  That way revenue can be down but profits could actually be up.
---
If you look back on it, cosmetics and additional items have always been a part of Bethesda games...they have just always been provided, for free, by the modding community.  Bethesda has been looking for a long time to find a way to make money off that...remember the paid modding fiasco a few years back?  They can hardly be blamed for finally figuring out how to make it work...
---
Did you use the new camp skin from the legendary run?
---
Everything in my scrap box has taken me MONTHS to gather/hoard, I handed in like 10k steel to see rewards for my self, and they just sucked imo just not worth my or many other players time, so I'm just ignoring it altogether, I'm surprised Beth didn't add 200 mil ballistic fibre, lead and fibre optics to the grind.........
---
Travel bug, Unyielding bug, crashes, ghouls with non head and legendarys which you cant loot..
---
More and more and more, to much for Listing...
---
I'm definitely happy with that. But uh. Can we fix cork too? Because uh. It's just as rare. I actually had more concrete than I do cork in my scrap box. And uh. I USE concrete. I don't actually use cork at all. Think about that.
---

---
Can you actually place a camp though?
---
So I was using unarmed for about 3 minutes and this dude started to use the tesla and once he did, the frames became ridiculous. For the rest of the event, 1-10 frames. It's so goddamn bad. I know it's the meat piles and not the tesla but I think that gun messes with the frames too. But this started all after patch 21...
---
I don't know a single person who thought 150M was achievable.
---
Does anyone in Bethesda play the game?
---
They changed the goal
---
Shottys are way better and so ammo efficient, I ditched my minigun day one and have used shotty ever since.
---
Could be the ash.
---
twin lakes and south of pleasant valley station
---
Yes! I love this community so much! When we all work together to make change Bethesda can listen and we all benefit! Maybe they will change the cork challenge...
---
If you play a lot it isn't bad. I build up to 8 or so, grab a new high capacity or fridge mod and sell them.
---
Big fun things hmm...
---
Whitespring fountain is a good one ... gunpowder has weight ... as does ore but you probably figured those out.
---
Hey I've got one and it is topical. Do stings and things right before you log out for a session break. It often re-ups as a daily when you get to a new server. Two chances at a badge is better that one.
---
Here's another. Head to site Charlie and scan the ground outside and see if there happens to be an osmosis kit there. Thank me later.
---
I'm not sure what camp skin you mean, but I don't think I had any of the legendary run items in my camp at all.
---
- Lone Wanderer has fallen to the wayside thanks to Public Teams
---
- Adamantium Skeleton is up to personal taste but I personally wouldn't waste points on it
---
- Suppressor is nice for Scorchbeast Queen or Wendigo Colossus but everything else dies too fast to be worth it
---
- Dodgy is good if you don't plan to use V.A.T.S. or run in the middle of a battle
---
Did they change the rest as well?
---
The only place I remember getting concrete reliably is from workshops which pump 12 an hour or whatever and then I open myself up to PVP.
---
Congratulations, they listened! The goal is now 15 million.
---
I'm just south of Graftom dam, very peaceful...
---
Just coming back here to laugh at the fact Bethesda dropped the concrete goal from 150mil to 15mil because no one was doing it. What was that about jokes again?
---
I can place a new camp module, yeah. Part of the camp is blueprinted in it but I can't place any of it because it's "floating" (because some of the foundations aren't in the blueprint).
---
Although I agree I could not upvote. You had 76 of them.
---
Ah I see. I was gonna add prime capacitor for my gauss mini for the better ammo usage. I don‚Äôt mind since my main build is unarmed junkies, but it‚Äôs nice having options thanks to heavy str/int/luck build. I figure just use my gauss mini for boss/raid stuff
---
How much did that cost you? Genuinely curious
---
It's the new design for your camp base thing. Not sure how else to describe it, but everyone who has used it has reported this same issue so I thought maybe that was the problem.
---
Concrete
---
Check the "ref" tab at this [nukacrypt link](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/0043C439).
---
Uh not unlimited stash for sure, just unlimited junk scrap, all junk gets broken down so some you may still need to stash.
---
Yeah it was 150mil with something like 4 mil collected.
---
We were supposed to get 150,000,000 but Bethesda realized that was unrealistic and lowered it to 15,000,000.
---
&gt; Here's another. Head to site Charlie and scan the ground outside and see if there happens to be an osmosis kit there. Thank me later.
---
The spawn point of Cranberry Glade is the same way. I've found 4 portable power packs and an osmosis kit there while looking for stuff to tame. Lots of the other items too, but they can be scrapped unlike the pack and kit.
---
Why concrete
---
Those hamsters are not highly trained. Most of them went to Devry and that art college where they had to draw the turtle and mail it back in....
---
I see what you're talking about now - no, I haven't even gotten to that one yet
---
Around 40 dollars USD. Excluding the 800 atoms I had saved so that took me from 50 to max
---
Bethesda to the rescue üòÇ
---
They dropped it and posted about it in Beth forums
---
Would you consider putting the upcoming airplane on the roof? Could add a cool effect!
---
And the new Event, i'll give 350 steel for what? A little bit caps and some shit stuff..
---
The new event is the big shit what are you doing..
---
Look at YouTube, Facebook who ever, all pissed of the new Shit Update, and the colossos event now one month laterü§£ü§£ 
---
As company you are a Joke!
---
There is an ammo workshop up north to the east. If you can get 100 power, a fusion core generator, you can have the computer make the ammo you need. My buddy says he gets about 400+ in only an hour or two.
---
To donate
---
Nah, bitch, you're just good. Haters gunna hate.
---
Ammo machine ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I went to donate the Concrete.  Then I realized They didn‚Äôt want my piddly 80 count donation.  Then I went and claimed a junk yard for hours just to constantly get the concrete from the extractor.  By the end of the session I have about 150 concrete.  Fuck this noise.
---
They changed it this afternoon in response to the massive outcry.
---
I went to the website and it said 15 million
---
It's the ash pile glitch
---
Aw dang. Other than restarting the game/trying a new server, I have no idea ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Where the hell did you get 3 million caps?
---
it would nice if they had a forum or websites that said know bugs (list them) bugs that are in the process of being fixed (list them) etc.
---
The glitch still works? And I thought it only works well on a private server
---
So far their website still shows the original outrageous goals but the goal of 150m concrete was updated not too long ago. I suspect they finally realized some materials like concrete, cork, and plastic just aren‚Äôt as common and not likely to reach the original goal they set. Hopefully they continue to update them.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think that was us
---
Don‚Äôt forget the ones who label each machine as well!
---
I‚Äôve never actually looked at Bethesda forums, I just logged in a few minutes ago and was happy that we could actually hit the goals. I wonder if all the other ones were dropped also
---
No.
---
Still works
---
Regardless of what you chose, it‚Äôll never be enough to live off of. It‚Äôll only be little amounts here and there that‚Äôll just be bonus to what you already collect from the open world. That being said, if you‚Äôre going to be making a lot of ammo, a lead resource would probably be the best.
---
Oh I totally would! Anything that works toward the verticality of the build :)
---
I noticed this on pc, fortunately because im on pc I can change more settings for smoother, consistent fps.
---
Theres not a lot of options ps4 that can help you
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423145/fortifying-atlas-concrete-goal-update?language%25255B%25255D=en&amp;language%255B%255D=en
---
Others not dropped yet
---
We need you Duper‚Äôs!  You‚Äôre our only hope!
---
Ooooooooookkkkkkkkkk................
---
Ugh I feel ya man. That's why I always chose an unnamed corner.
---
No and i regret it now,i kept the gold with another toon and she was friendly,
---
I was thinking between lead, acid or junk. And the only place to get both lead and acid in one camp is bombarded by scorch Beasts like every 5 minutes.
---
There are tons of concrete deposits across the map that players can place an extractor on
---
There's a junk pile by the river, north of food processing workshop. Personally, lead and acid are better resources to grind, because there's always a market for them: but I don't know where any are near water
---
I‚Äôm same, don‚Äôt move my camp much and I farm the concrete resource at Poseidon super often. I still only had 1.5k to offer
---
What boils my piss is I'm trying to roll a good minigun but they weigh a shit ton and I can't really afford to have a 100kg of dead stuff in my stash, so obviously I hit scrip limit very quickly and then the rest I have to just dump because I can't sell or scrap them.......... some days I feels I've played free mobile games with more freedom.
---
P.S.  FO1st won't free the shackles of stash limit you still hit it and struggle  (I got FO1st btw)
---
I haven't and won't donate because I don't care about this event, BOS is cool if you're a teen boy I guess. and the rewards suck.
---
however I don't think it matters if you donate or not, they're not going to NOT move ahead with the seasons.
---
How dare they release free cosmetics and in-game events, have they no shame
---
As someone that has around 500 weight in plans I rather see a trade in for points system that allows you to buy plans/goods from them. As it stands I have all but the super rare plans priced at 1c each. I get nearly cleaned out everyday I am just now up to the S's with more stacking up.
---
Thanks I was just trying to find that post, they‚Äôre going to have to drop the cork goal considerably since it‚Äôs the hardest material to farm
---
I wish I played this on my PC man...
---
Depends on your spec. For me, i go through lots of copper making ammo.
---
Acid. You can farm breach and clear and use all the acid to smelt
---
I usually hop around the LFG joining anything mentioning Queen, and then just go all in with the cryolater so we don't have to care as much about her wanting to never land.
---
At the time of posting this reply it looks to me like we're still winningüòé. Thanks for showing out folks, hopefully Bethesda reads this.  I'm hoping my role play suggestions will make *everyone* happy, not just pvp.  I'd like my dedication to the Free States and Crater to mean something, and I'm sure y'all feel the same way about your choices too!
---
Thing is PvP was a rushed last minute addin in the development. Everything was PvE minded. To have a PvP experience that is actually enjoyable legendary effects have to be nulled. All the effects were made for PvE where balance is important but not as vital as to PvP. I have seen MMOs in the past try to make two seta of rules for how things behave in PvP vs PvE and in the end they nerf PvE because its to difficult to mange the two rule seta for PvP and PvE. Just bring survival back and make it non legendary and it would be a great mode.
---
Do you really think that'll be added? Or are you just throwing your ideas out there?
---
update............  12.53 of an adjusted 15 mil goal achieved so far for concrete
---
If ammo is your goal then you're probably going to want to extract lead.  If caps then extracted copper sells good in bulk and extracted silver scrap (no bulking required) sells pretty good and really isn't used for much that I can think of.  Also consider a location where mobs spawn at your camp.  My camp is on top of a tick spawn and those break down to make antiseptic / blood packs which you can use to make stims to sell.  If no water around just save enough budget to get at least 3 ground based wells for 6 purified waters on the regular.
---
Fuck pvp
---
I sold that exact weapon and it glitched in my vendor.  Are you on PC?
---
Chad Duper: *Dupes concrete*
---
Virgin Duper: *Dupes weapons*
---
The people with legacy Tesla‚Äôs are the problem, they pop in and everything goes to shit.
---
Lol. Do you have better math or assumptions I should be using?
---
Yeah. The main reason I‚Äôm looking for a water source is I already have 2 industrial water purifiers built and can store them
---
Its 250
---
This.
---
They didn‚Äôt drop the requirements, they gave us 135,000,000 concrete for free.
---
still shit
---
Not by the junk extractor. It‚Äôs easy to find. Look for the busted shack with the beehives.
---
T-60 Plans!!!
---
yeah. there's many posts about it tbh
---
WE DID IT!!
---
Well, there is a way but...it's a budget exploit. Also you are literally locked in the moment you leave the server no more budget glitching no more adding if you subtract you don't get a swap. If you store it you store it fine though but you also can not run wires after.  
---
 And you will need a lot and I mean A LOT of copper.   
---
If interested just google camp budget glitch and there is a few videos up.
---
I did a round today and besides there being a massive delay between when people showed up to help and only me doing any gathering it ran without a problem on PS4.
---
any mod from that slot will replace it
---
I wouldn't go around saying that too much or the bethesda fangirls will say that you expect to have stash space and all those items handed to you for free
---
Same presents only a another name on itü§£
---
Aha, my apologies. I somehow completely missed all of them.
---
no
---
I‚Äôm on a steel deposit but I think I‚Äôm going to try to find a lead deposit in a nice spot
---
Same, I'm a auto + semi auto build.
---
You try listening to it?  
---
I was wondering about this with my character too, but at this point I just assume everything is a bug.. but after reading this I logged on and listened to it. It is for the Side mission 'Into The Mystery' and goes with the Worn Veil that I assume you have in your Apparel tab
---
Happens a lot with heavy weapons. Don't personally see it as much with other kinds of weapons. You can sprint for a moment and then use the ADS bind again and it should clear it up when it happens.
---
Also interesting when it distorts the camera view and fucks up your accuracy instead of improving it.
---
I keep hearing that is that the one near the bottom middle of the map below foundation? If it is I've had mine there for months without an attack by anything other than dogs
---
Short answer, yes.
---
great comment, made me laugh, he should also have a scream attack where he says "we actually had plenty of them lying around" and spews water cooled bonesaws at you
---
Nah, slightly different, have 25k presents, so I'm good anyway :-)
---
Yeee have the same feeling
---
I hoped you slapped him/her down after he had his fun though, just so they don't forget what the harsh widow maker the wasteland is?
---
An accounting error has already been found that took it from 150 mil to 15 mil, easily seen on their events page. So now we apparently only have 2.5 mil to go.
---
Called it. Theyre not gonna let it fail. They're gonna do the same for cork.
---
Part of the ship, part of the crew.
---
Just replace it with another mod from that slot. But be aware if you decide you want it back you‚Äôll have to craft it again, which requires a few flux.
---
I am all in for that food to be honest, I really like buffing up with consumables
---
&gt; I am seeing people on here claiming that it's failing because people are fed up and refuse to donate. I don't think that's true. 
---
You'd like it to not be true. In actual fact, under different circumstances, I wouldn't have any doubt in my mind that we could achieve any target that Bethesda sets, realistic or otherwise.
---
We don't know how much of an impact one way or the other the boycotters would have made, though coming from one such advocate, I doubt that it would have been a lot given the response.
---
However, there is zero question at all that the shitty rewards are directly the reason for why we're unable to meet the mark.
---
With better rewards e.g. gold bullion, scrip, atoms, new unique items or plans, do you even doubt for a moment that dupers wouldn't have stepped up to pull us over the line? Even legit players would have drained their scrapboxes, scrapped down their camps and devoted many extra hours to this game farming to squeeze out every last bit of scrap.
---
Yeah, the unrealistic targets didn't help but it would have been a non-issue with good rewards.
---
Yeah i only have one piece and thats saved my arse a few times, specially when alone. Thanks for the info. Another LS piece is something to consider when i reroll again.
---
Do you have any sort of tutorial for someone looking to do something like this? :-)
---
Also, is there a farm?
---
The best we could do would be coordinating workshop claims to have concrete extractors running as long as the server can bare.
---
I've made a similar post today asking for more pvp events so we can all stop butting heads and maybe get some more role play options.  Gotta say I like your idea too and I think theres even potential to meet in the middle.  Would it not be cool if settler players could defend a caravan against raider players and maybe there was a non NW score challenge related to it?  Maybe on a post not strictly related to pvp I can get a little more love on that idea...  But yeah I like what you're workin with at face value regardless.  I've been trying to kill robots with goofy weapons lately myself lol
---
I just buy bulk concrete and give it up ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
If that's true then I really hate those guns. A dude started using one after 3 minutes, then it started. No issues before and I had like 25 kills.
---
North of the mothman museum has a few junk spots right on the river , farming junk is the best idea in my opinion because you get everything and just store it in your first box for when you need it
---
Yeah it blurs pretty much the whole screen apart from the thing you‚Äôre looking at
---
Yeah I do have the veil so it‚Äôs that then huh
---
which differents only the plans, less caps as the another presents
---
I would say, for me the sameü§£
---
I have over 200k on mine mules
---
I can't contribute at all.  Without fallout 1st I am no help.
---
Yup, I love those. I spawn in at the top of a cliff, quickly build my camps to get the achievement, then promptly fling myself off the cliff to kill myself.
---
What engine would run this type of game better?
---
With Wastelanders that fissure site next to the nodes closed.  No more scorchbeasts there now. Good luck loading in though because it always has a camp there in the servers I join.
---
Between the lead and acid nodes and the awesome natural arch it is very high demand.
---
I'm built up on a lake due east of the Pleasant Valley Train Station down the hill there's a good size lake that always has 3 Brahmin chilling on it. I eat so much Ribeye I'm more likely to die of heart disease than anything else.
---
LMAO!  And I bet a bunch of that 12M is faked.
---
I still don't have 250 to donate even once though.
---
There's no new content, if that's what you're asking. The BOS stuff is just a precursor (like cleaning up Appalachia last year) to the update in a couple months. Legendary run is just a way to get casual fans to feel more involved in the game (which is a good thing BTW), but there's always something to do, even if you've done it before
---
meat piles are causing massive fps drop
---
Yeah my shotty has bash damage on it. Nice until they fix it Q_Q
---
Gonna be a perma ban when they do go after these people , horrible idea.
---
No im on Xbox weird I wonder if it was like a duped weapon and maybe when you buy a duped weapon you get nothing. If so thats kinda fucked up
---
same most of the server was there and all i got were angry emotes
---
I'll raise a pole, with a BoS flag on it, just for you!
---
I used 2000+ today before they patched smiley, regs had a good day... :-)
---
Wich exact mod replaces it? I dont have enough bullion to try to buy many ? And thanks in advance for the answer
---
Sorry I misread your Post and thought you used PA, but it deflects or reflect projectiles.
---
I did NOT see this coming. Very interested to see if this inspires folks to deplete their stash.
---
I've noticed shotguns hardly do anything against the Scorched. Most of time it takes my low level friend 5-6 shells just to kill a lvl 1  Scorched. He's lvl 12.
---
I never lock my stuff, my water and collectron are free for anyone, honestly it doesnt collect near as much as I do. If someone needs somethjng, ill be there to help, thats just being polite. 
---
Communist collectron with a lock, kinda idiosynchratic.
---
I can always use more flux.
---
Definitely what it is , only time I have any issues is when those people show up and lag out the entire event
---
I know that it's too late for them to include this, but it's just a thought I had.
---
üòÜ
---
Yeah i feel itü§£
---
Meat, ash, goo piles cause this. Reloging to the same server fixes fps issue and you can loot.
---
Why do users here keep having so much better concepts than the devs? Man, that would have been great.
---
Oh right. We actually play it so we know what would be good or not.
---
Wait they reduced it?
---
Same lol I got it cleared my stash down to like 300 space and I was back up 800 in like a month
---
They did. Because it was going to fail and fail BIG. They weren‚Äôt going to let that type of embarrassment happen, so they moved the goalposts.
---
I think it contributes to the problem though.
---
Not enough concrete amd rewards suck.
---
This is annecdotal but I play with about a dozen people who myself included donate steel and after seeing how bad the rewards really were not one of us have donated amy concrete and we don't plan on donating other things as well. I know myself have about 4k concrete but I'd rather it go to waste in my stash.
---
Calibrated shocks on other PA gives extra weight as well. But why not carry 2 sets of PA and use a better set to fight?
---
My tracker still says 150m?
---
Big Iron &gt; Kick in the head &gt; Every other song in Fallout games &gt; Johnny Guitar.
---
They use a dart board to decide what's on the agenda. It's obviuos they have no real structure and no real leadership.
---
Lol there‚Äôs concrete everywhere at least ten bags in flat woods get the app fo76 you can find it everywhere
---
Praise Todd! It's a Christmas miracle!!
---
Dense
---
Yes. The goal is now 15 million. So that's like, what, a 90% reduction? Similarly, to reach the goal each player would just need to donate 30 concrete, and since that's not possible to do a single 250 donation is quite a few players (around 8) worth of donations for the quota.
---
The Events page is listing only 15 million right now.  I don't know if that means they adjusted the numbers (it would be hilarious if it was a repeated typo...lol) or if the slider was meant to increase to show the whole 150 million once we got close to it.
---
I have a donut bar with 2 garage doors(on opposite sides of building) and 4 vendors inside (3 donut robots and 1 normal vend shop on opposite side), so it doesn't matter where you spawn . Also unlocked water industrials and collectron and some nuka vendor with 1:15 chance to get shined upon.
---
In raider style.
---
GOD BLESS THE FREE STATES
---
I‚Äôm in it 24/7 and barely ever need to repair , are you using any mutations that cause damage effects when struck ? Not sure if it causes this issue but could be worth looking into
---
That extra zero was a bug when patch 22 was released
---
its been about 150 levels since I last moved used (and deleted) a blueprint, so I could be wrong, but IIRC, it freed budget When I deleted the blueprint,
---
Not sure if workshop blueprints count against camp budget,
---
By some posts I've read, pipe weapons scrap for cork. So you can farm it easier by scraping pipe weapons
---
I'm not seeing the connection to this complaint.  They addressed the building issues because they were a big issue with server stability and were widly used in duplication methods.
---
I‚Äôm literally always out of concrete and couldn‚Äôt donate any at all, which is a shame because I actually kinda wanted the CAMP item. If it was glass or something then that‚Äôs easy but concrete just isn‚Äôt common enough
---
This happened to me today, and literally 20 minutes later when I went to modify the weapon, noticed it wasn‚Äôt there and caps were missing from the sale. As soon as the words ‚Äúwhat the hell‚Äù came out of my mouth it appeared in my inventory, started the animation on my screen and all. I was about to trip out. Possible bug?
---
It used to be even better especially in PVP with assassins as the major. It was that you would just ignore 15% damage while standing still which stacked for each piece plus the 8% for each assassins piece against players was guaranteed as well (might have been 10% before the nerf). So basically you‚Äôd take zero damage from other players unless they could get you to do the stagger animation
---
I can't RP a guy who's opposed to the brotherhood of techno fascism?  Being completely serious?
---
THANK YOU! I am back to the grind, Solar Armor !
---
Thank you that's the answer I was looking for,  thanks a lot
---
Or the devs are roleplaying as vault tec just to see how crazy they can drive their fans before we bail on them completely, that‚Äôs my theory
---
Thanks for at least sharing this. RNG sucks
---
It doesn't require that much power, only fusion core generators at the power plants require 100 power.
---
Thank you, trying to link that on my phone was proving... Challenging.
---
22?! I thought we were on 21 still!
---
It'd be cool if it happened is all I'm saying~
---
Most of the time I laugh but sometimes I need this mobs! Wonder if it can be fixed
---
And you think 12 ammunition extractors in every camp doesn‚Äôt effect server stability? Really ?
---
It's a guess but it would be consistent with their design philosophy of gating newly added content in different ways.  I don't really think BOS will care about bullion and caps are already easy enough to come by.  I don't really mind the multiple currencies but I dislike the time gated exchanges.
---
Especially if they want their own ultracite pa
---
I gave up trying last week. Lmfao!. I am done playing this fucking control game Bethesda thinks we are all going to abide buy. Can you say donkey carrot scenario. Keep the carrot and if you need a BOS boot to help  fit it in your ass I have one. 
---
I want real content, not this  sit booboo sit, now go fatch, good boy, bullshit. 
---
I have paid for a game as advertised, action packed post apocalyptic warfare, and I get 450+ CAD of controlled content, half broken promises, and not to mention a side dish of bullshit bug infestation of glitches and problems that reminds me of this one time in Bangkok at Morocco motel, and sleaze bar. 
---
I have tried to make suggestions, and I have reported more issues with this game in my 3700hrs of game play that I could have earned a degree in consumer protection at this point. Just saying, this game is heading in the wrong direction, and it seems like a select few get the final say in what to come for the future of Fallout 76. Instead of having a community suggestion box, or a  community vote on new content we want to see from this game. 
---
The aragents of the management smells worse than my 1 year old nieces diaper, that right get over yourselfs, you are only as good as this game, and not communicating with everyone except a select few, is just as gliched as this broken down golf cart. 
---
Eventually the towers will fall and guess what the fall of this Awesome but broken franchise will eventually fall on deaf ears. Remember don't bite the hand that feeds you, because the hand just might bite back. 
---
That being said, enough is enough Bethesda, you can keep the money, but there may not be a next time. 
---
On a nother note, I truly wish you, and everyone that matters all the best. It time to demand better service and quality for what we have paid for, this bullshit antics has gone on long enough folks. 
---
Because the Fallout76 community matters. And we deserve better than this.
---
OP is incorrect
---
It took me about 2 months to get all the Power Armor paints. For some reason though, after the third paint they started appearing more often. So I went from Paladin to Elder in a few days. But who really knows, might have just been blessed by the God of RNG.
---
Yup , special offer now 90% off üòÇ
---
150million was ridiculous , even when people was duping junk I never heard of concrete being one ? 
---
Now if they said lead instead of concrete ü§îüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Thanks for the explanation. Fits with what i saw
---
Good luck! I lucked out with the chest piece and got the Vanguard Solar Chest on my 2nd try so now I'm rolling for the Left Leg.
---
The rep drop isn't that much as far as I know, an I believe the most popular option is to get the bullion for yourself since that's like more than the max of what you can get in a week
---
&gt; wouldn't have any doubt in my mind that we could achieve any target that Bethesda sets,  
---
That's  because you aren't bothering with the event.  If you actually tried participating in the event and tried  farming concrete in significant quantities, then you would see how near impossible it is to do. You know nothing about how achievable the goal is because you aren't trying to achieve it.
---
You can't achieve a goal if you have to collect material is not  there to be collected.
---
That would be amazing. Last time it was available was during the time frame  I was taking a break from the game.
---
Except when the bugs were active and people would click your vendor before the camp loaded in fully and could get shit from your stash
---
Do you know where exactly it is? I‚Äôm by the fissure site and Lake Eloise but i haven‚Äôt seen it. Is it up the mountain?
---
WHIP 'EM OUT BOYS, WE DID IT!!
---
The way it works Is the damage cap is per shot not overall. That‚Äôs why you can use a FFR mini gun and melt the SBQ but the 10k from a single shotgun blast would reach the Damage Cap and therefore reset the damage you dealt.
---
OP is right, we'll be fine.
---
There is no way that we went from 4m to 12m in a day or less when Bethesda just shifted the goal posts not long ago.
---
That's a boosted number. We'll easily make it over the line.
---
Theres like 20 posts
---
No. Not to the same degree of the game trying to load all those walls in a single location as they move their camp.
---
With any hope yes , cork and glass may be an issue  , glass does seem abundant via beer and nuka cola bottles ect. Though
---
I do have some lead now. Daily runs to keep my rifles fed. They are hungry.
---
Has anyone considered that this might be a way for them to find the egregious dupers?
---
Secret Service will literally be the only gear people will be running around in soon just like bloodied is currently what everyone runs around with; eventually the meta will destroy itself and your time spent will be time wasted when it is re-balanced.
---
Which really just seems to me that he's an alcoholic.
---
Me saying 22 was a result of a bug from patch 21
---
I think I was really lucky. I only spent about 30 Legendary Modules to get a full 3* Unyielding set, but even before I got the full thing I had a few pieces of 2* Unyielding.
---
Build on a static critter spawn point you can control , if it has three rad roaches it will always be three rad roaches. Lived on the tic shack for months with zero issues and one turret killing them all.
---
There are active dupes again but you can‚Äôt double your bounty instead it creates bulk concrete and it takes a bit of effort to get 20-50k. But enough that people are willing to burning dupe accounts over.
---
Yes have seen this at LIS. But only once and it didn't effect my FPS.
---
Look up the rewards from completing it with that faction. Raiders get the ammo machine at max rank which seems more useful than the turbo fertilizer. But to answer your question no the others rep doesnt get hurt by siding with anyone
---
Word. Like where I can do a week or so of dailies and max back out?
---
This evening they did patch a bug in which its reported once users leave the building after purchasing gold from smiley , and re-entering you could purchase another amount and would keep going every time the building was exited and entered
---
Yes. Keep the gold. Screw em. You do all the work anyways. Use the photo opportunity pics to sell the photos for the rep  points at the lacking faction to catch up.
---
Not a bug, it's a feature...
---
Technically they didn't?  You dipshits have seriously  been claiming that overnight they'd suddenly make 140+ million concrete pop into the tally.  That's clearly what didn't happen.
---
Bethesda is literally admitting they fucked up with these numbers and is taking community feedback to bring them into achievable range and you're still being a bitch about it.
---
They don't want us to fail any of these you dipshit, they want us to have at least a fighting chance of unlocking everything.
---
All armor pieces have material and misc mod slot. Material mods are the ones that just add defense values, while misc ones are the ones that add some form of new function to the item.
---
Same with today‚Äôs photo challenge: I‚Äôve had whole teams drop out within thirty seconds loading in as everyone takes the photo and peaces out. Forcing people to play NW for one reward is not going to promote the game mode amongst the player base.
---
&gt; We know steam is one of the smaller parts of the player base.
---
Why do you assume that?
---
Hopefully it mix in well with the daily ops as they are going to be dungeons type of thing
---
Over 500 hrs and I had only a bit over 2k concrete.
---
I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt as this was really just a product of experimentation and seeing what worked for me. But I did use the elevated farm tiles so that I could grown corn for my new chicken coop :)
---
I'll check that once I'm home, thanks for the info
---
lol.
---
I have this happen all the time {Edit: since patch 21}. I think it's either the ash piles or flies from meat piles, or a combination of both. I run a 1660 OC with latest drivers and it does it. Edit2: FPS don't drop tho, just pixeled like mad.
---
They're just the Christmas presents, minus everything of value, it's just stims and alcohol! The plans are bugged out and just don't drop at all!
---
Is it that Turbo-Fert thing? I thought it was supposed to be the flower bed planters so I can finally put my crops on my roof and not have rats and mutants wrecking them.
---
Thats one person
---
Seems to be related to whatever they did to Teslas in the last patch going by what others have said
---
They not in game and honestly I hope they never are
---
I prefer a color theme for quality instead of stars
---
Sept 8th
---
Right. I should be fine then. Thanks. Will probably be cutting it VERY close though.
---
The Gamebryo/Creation engine is almost 20 years old. Bethedsa dropped 76 on a new, inexperienced team (B-Team), gave them their marching orders and a deadline, while the vets worked on whatever that game is they're showing off now.  
---
B had to call in Id Software to come hammer in a triangle netcode into a circle engine. Things tend to break when you try make something do something it wasn't designed to. Especially when they're old.
---
Oh no. I know precisely how scarce concrete is having build a mega brick camp once and having to forage for the concrete from next to nothing. Over several days because I couldn't get enough in one go.
---
You missed a crucial part of my comment as to why I would have been so confident if the rewards were better.
---
Anyhow, it doesn't matter. If Bethesda moved the goal posts, we'll be fine. We could put in zero effort and STILL get the reward.
---
There is no way in the world that Bethesda will drop the requirement by 90% and then let us fail. It's bad PR. 
---
At least this way when they cheat the numbers it looks moderately realistic. Boosting from 4m to 12m and then later some number over 15m looks more realistic than boosting from 4m to 100m to 150m.
---
I have zero doubt in my mind that we'll get the banner.
---
With a more solidly build game by a more competent studio, I would 100% agree with you. However, it's this game and Bethesda we're talking about. We're fine.
---
And turning in legendries with paint jobs can easily be solved by taking the paint job off.  Definitely more upside as it is now, keeping items with paint jobs off vendor menu's.
---
It's time to harvest Charleston boys, we'll get that concrete yet.
---
I can't understand why it's so difficult to simply test this shit out before it's pushed out to the public. It's ridiculous. I used to work in Store Support, basically tech support for a chain of stores. When the developers changed something, they had a few test stores to change it and test those changes in before it went live. If something was a disaster, they fixed it before they globally pushed it out to every single store. 
---
Those stores didn't have anywhere near the budget of BGS, so I can't understand why BGS has such a miserably consistent rate of failures with these patches.
---
They have to be, same thing.
---
It‚Äôs a duper trap , they are using this ‚Äúevent‚Äù to flush out the people who cheat
---
That‚Äôs actually really good use of the card. Sniping takes skill, you‚Äôre just leveraging your perk to get a better handle on that. I love Frogs Legs for the tactical plays like this, but I *hate* it for the gauss shotgun jump-spam that can render most engagements an exercise in futility for the team that doesn‚Äôt run that build. I‚Äôm very much in the ‚Äúmake it a mutation‚Äù camp, but then I think the whole mode needs a balance pass and TTK overhaul in my opinion.
---
They said it was unrealistic so they lowered it
---
Iirc you only need ‚Äúneighborly‚Äù for the planters
---
Jealous much bohoo? :(
---
These walls caused server instability and it was easy to crash server to ANYONE present on that server... Which is not a case with 12 ammo factories per camp as you stated.
---
Would you like a napkin?  
---
(And btw, they already said they are working on a legit 2side walls).
---
 https://imgur.com/psAVtaR
---
Yes, I lost all three of my teammates this way today since I didn't want to be the person to leave my teammates hanging.  Ended up finishing 5th!  They should have stayed!  lol
---
Nothing.
---
This. 
---
Even with unrealistic goals, with good rewards the dupers would have blown us way past the target.
---
I always use pointing Vault boys from the spawn points to show people where to go to find the vender!
---
The vending theft bug is still in the game and I can't risk putting them directly at spawn!
---
They should have changed the provision rewards, maybe then we could have hit 150m. Just saying.
---
True, I've got 6k cork
---
Some salvage can only be sold when bulked.
---
Lmfao! I completely agree with what you are saying, and I have probably played this game more than those that downvoted you for your opinion. That right, 3700 hours bitches. I can't wait to watch all the Fanboys attack my comment. The truth is the truth, and if everyone wants to be controlled by this corporate entity, than so be it. 
---
They can't handle the truth, know let's go cut off our fingers together. Lmfao! 
---
I wish you all the best. And thanks for being real about things. Something that most can't even fathom. 
---
And if they cared this game would be fixed, if they cared, the server wouldn't crash or freeze, if they cared the content wouldn't be half fasted.
---
I'm not botherong for same reason i got zero pails. I do not care. Like they offer nothing interesting.
---
I did the crap out of fasnacht. It was a fun social event with a 1-3 star item or two at the end, on a predictable schedule i could pick up whenever i had free time.
---
Yeah I dunno man your need to get like 1,000,000,000 xp
---
It‚Äôs the ammo machine extractors in everyone‚Äôs camps , not sure why people think it‚Äôs harmless
---
I want a dingy looking pool and to be able to plant tarberries in it!
---
The staircase thing in the sky looks terrible but everything else looks great
---
Wont happen on the basis of theres still duped presents out there.. millions of them 
---
And getting caps *and* plans to then turn in for some new form of currency will just break things again üòÇ
---
Just a few points here:
---
- I don‚Äôt need 30 rounds when 1/4-1/2 does the job
---
- that extra ap also works just as well for dodgy or any other ap draining perks
---
-bloodied especially don‚Äôt need a high dmg rifle to get a kill or low dmg heavy that will ruin stealth. Don‚Äôt even need to be a stealth build to get a nice bonus from it
---
‚ÄúProve your toxicity‚Äù? it‚Äôs reddit man. You think none of us have been downvoted like crazy!? Lol it‚Äôs a social media platform that rewards anonymity. Of course you‚Äôre going to get downvoted. You got what? A couple downvotes? No one‚Äôs running your nose in piss over a couple downvotes. You gotta not take this app so personally if you‚Äôre going to get so hurt over sarcasm and a dislike...
---
LOL they dropped it to 15 million the absolute gents
---
Fallout 1st doesn‚Äôt help you. You need the concrete actually on you to donate.
---
Ok , it's good to know ,I'm not much into ss armor since I like the ones I have earn already,  but thanks
---
It's clearly Atlas. As annoying as Treasure Hunter was, at least you were able to get new rewards.
---
Atlas is a shitty event with shitty rewards for all but the newest of players (even then it's not that great).
---
Aww, he deleted his account?  Really?
---
Lol, you didn't answer my question. Maybe ID fucked it up.
---
Unlikely, fortunately the legendary prefix will happen after whether they are alive or not from my experience.
---
(Haven't seen a legendary mysteriously die)
---
We know
---
I dont even try to collect concrete, most runs can yield around 400,thats less that 2 donations per server, it shows that the devs dont even play their game and dont have a clue about it, let them autocomplete it because failing would be such a huge humiliation for them.
---
It‚Äôs still a few weeks but each score rank goes up by 25 points. I‚Äôm at 78 I think and need around 3k points a rank
---
I tried farming concrete by capping 4 workshops in a private world. I farmed for 4 hours, actively visiting places I knew had concrete and going back and forth between workshops every so often. around 1000-1500... I also looked at the numbers of active players, according to a sketchy site 23k. If everyone participated equally that'd mean everyone would have to have 26x 250 concrete. That's fucking impossible bethesda!
---
Maybe purchase a second hard drive?
---
I hear that helps *alot* 
---
-I wish I did this for when I excessively played battlefield V
---
I pre-oredered fo76 for ps4 and played it for two months but then couple months ago bought it for PC.
---
Nothing new for me..  I guess I'm too greedy lol
---
Yes I did. Any engine made with large scale online ability.
---
No, not what I meant at all. Just sayin don't assume that someone w/ FO1st is a duper. Some of us are just retirees w/ high pain levels that find things like this game a way to distance ourselves from that pain for a bit and so consider the monthly fee an investment in myself, like paying for a prescription.
---
Honestly Im glad they lowered it, I hope they do the same for the other materials. Leather and cloth are easy, but cork will be rough for 200m.
---
I found it to be a fun challenge, all it took was the medic perk to boost the strength of stimpacks, and pharma farma to get more stimpacks! This brought about ideas for potential strategies.
---
I rolled like 50 plasma casters and couldn‚Äôt get a jffr, then I rolled less than 10 gauss minis and got one, and now it‚Äôs been back and forth between plasma casters and gauss rifles... the only thing close I‚Äôve gotten was a J5025 which is good in V.A.T.S., but I don‚Äôt even use vats
---
Its almost sad but its so true it hurts so I guess I'll cry either way.
---
I only started it on my ps4 because of a few friends. Then they stopped playing, so now I'm just stuck. I wish I could transfer over lol. Yeah, maybe replacing this old HD could help
---
Didn't they just unban a bunch of them
---
Just had this happen for first time tonight during a failed encrypted. I was like what the heck and it was so laggy on Xbox. So I tried the urban myth of laggy servers and purveyor giving good loot. Welp that‚Äôs false I got a hunter guass pistol and a anti armor assault tron head lol
---
That doesn't sound very fun or fair.
---
The theme parks (cups with straws) too
---
I had good luck crafting when I loot 1 or 2 unyielding armor in the wild on a server.  I think I went through almost 100 modules with no unyielding.  I‚Äôve seen many times on here people thinking the servers get seeded with higher RNG with certain types so I decided to try it, with 20 modules I got both pieces I needed at 3 stars.  Might be coincidence but honestly I‚Äôll be trying it that way from now on just in case lol.
---
Now just waiting on those deep pocket mods...
---
That would've been cool. Something akin to Fasnacht where you had to all meet up at a location, get a piece of equipment working, break down some large structure, or fight some kind of enemy to harvest a resource. 
---
I guess it would've been too much effort to drag and drop and repurpose some existing resources into a new event though, so let's just drop crap in a bucket and call it an event.
---
That 'Rockbreaker" in the Ash Heap would've been a prime location for a huge event like this. You could've had events there, waves of Mole Miners, Blood Eagles, or whatever that you had to fight off while that thing collected the needed resource.
---
That requires moving your camp and then you are still stuck with the problem of getting 12 an hour or whatever the rate is.
---
I like this but I also kind of wish they didn‚Äôt have a specific amount you HAVE to donate. I would give up my 130 concrete but they want 250 and I simply haven‚Äôt been able to find enough to donate. 
---
Maybe like, you get a reward every 250 you donate but you don‚Äôt have to do all 250 at once
---
Didn‚Äôt say it makes sense. They don‚Äôt give a shit about cheaters we all know it
---
Kill 'em all and steal their jackets.
---
On pc? HMU for shotgun shells.... Same ign...
---
Watoga High School too. Cafeteria used to be LOADED with plastic, but I think they may have scaled it back a bit based on the last couple times I've been in there... or maybe someone did a half-ass job of picking it over just before I went in??
---
It just shows a lack of regard for others opinion, and a complete misinterpretation of what I'm even getting at.  Really my concern here is Bethesda hopefully getting an earful from our side of the fence but it's hard to do that when we're always getting shit on by people that don't even participate.  Please quit stepping on us and just let us convey our opinion?  Maybe if we're all lucky they'll give us separate spaces.  Think about it.  That's what we all want so really I'm trying to help you.  So maybe stop downvoting something that you know would be a boon to you if you thought about it for more than a nanosecond?!  That's all we ask.
---
Yeah right nobody is donating that much concrete. I call BS.(For the sake of transparency we all need to come togather as a community and refuse to do the next goal just to see if there is a fail.)
---
You can't transfer your profile from console to pc sadly, I had to start afresh lol but it was worth it.
---
But I was the same, I played it with another friend-he had far more time on his hand to play it &amp; he got bored of it way before I did.
---
I still like the game, now at level 600 but im contemplating other games...
---
Jealousy implies every moron with YouTube couldn‚Äôt do it ü§£ gonna laugh when you all get perma banned
---
God bless the enclave
---
This is such a good idea it will certainly never happen.
---
I had a concrete extractor running most of the day yesterday, kept up pretty well with emptying it out, and I had enough for ONE stack. GG
---
You won't make it without spending atoms to buy levels
---
That item was never released and even if it had been, it would have been an exclusive as part of a bundle. Wouldn't be surprise if 1st gets the Nuka Cola Girl refrigerator we keep seeing pictures of, but is yet to be released.
---
Ah. Damn I'm slow. Don't mind me here.
---
Now you need to use frog legs and camp blueprints to climb buildings to get to roofs!
---
i honestly don‚Äôt think you will finish it. you are very far behind. Recommended rank today is 71 to finish on time

Imma be completely honest...I‚Äôm lvl 218 and haven‚Äôt donated squat shit. Sry bout that boys. üò¨:(
---
Junk, that's all I buy from vendors now. When set at a reasonable price. The rest I either have better weapons, know all the plans or don't need.
---
Amen
---
This.  Scrapper perk gets me about 150 plastic and 500+ steel every time I run through WestTek.
---
Yeah I agree, I just built a brand new system on saturday. The new CPU and GPU cut the fps loss by half....RTX 2080 TI but still unplayable. That GPU was a loaned part for a proof of concept test that it was software over hardware causing the shader cache issues; not my normal GPU.. :(

"It's utterly insane that I should have to spend money to get *extra* enjoyment out of an online game that is actively receiving updates".
---
The entitlement is strong in this one.
---
batch files.. i never thought of that. do you just move your custom.ini out of the folder and back?
---
Both. Items moreso -- if I am really after X and they have a lot of it.
---
Mine is updated. 12/15 million so far.
---
The location doesn't matter to me at all. Depends on my mood, but if they don't have a lot of ammo and/or 5+ weapons for sale, I usually won't bother unless I'm going in that direction already.
---
Ammo quantity first, then location

Atoms

Dude it‚Äôs gone on every fucking world

They lowered it and made a post saying so on their forums.

So relax. There‚Äôs no need for such drama.

Either have different chests for different amounts (one accepts 50 units, another accepts 100, another 250, etc.) or do something like the ammo converter, but.....you know....less nausea inducing.
---
I honestly like weapons armor and plans, but more than not its non legendary gear and mountd recipes
---
I've joined 4 events with such a platform, the SBQ never once landed on it, at least we were all safe from the mobs though, and it'd easy to shoot the Queen at that height.
---
Would have been pissed if I was on my melee build.
---
Amounts of plans and armor (hoping for outfits I don't have), but sadly it's always 2 star legendaries with auto stim and underwater breathing.
---
You don't need to approach the bench to take a workshop: holding the menu button anywhere will do.
---
Why "solo"? Just do public groups, stack +int/XP buffs, and event hop. I basically did what you're trying to do by grinding events with a huge stack of molotovs. It went quick.
---
what if they fooled you thrice?
---
Oof
---
Also a lot of people might have been of the "there's no way, so don't bother trying" mentality, and might now work to get it done.
---
I can't bring myself to care about anything, let alone this lame shit. All the tin foil hat peeps said it didn't matter how much we turned in, it would just work out. And look, it's working out. Save your mats. Or don't. It truly doesn't matter.
---
I really don't think that they understand the game or the people who play it beyond the cosmetics, which is why that is the sole focus of their patches. 
---
They could search this sub and find numerous obvious things to fix that would improve player experience ten-fold, but instead, Bethesda would rather put a new skin for a suit of armor in the Atom shop instead of fixing a problem that people have been griping about for months. Like the incessant reptition of dialogue from allies, Protectrons, and other NPC in the game, for instance.
---
My huge gripe lately with the game is the FT bug, but that's been going on since Wastelanders dropped and it seems to have gotten worse with this new patch, but it's as if it's not even on their radar.
---
Plus, why the hell can't the targeting reticule land on your marker when you die? Nope, has to be across the fucking map, so you've got to go figure out where you died at on the fucking map again. Enjoy your time with Inventory &amp; Interface Simulator 2000!!

The one think I don‚Äôt have in abundance is concrete, fucking typical
---
This is what I get for juggling two season pass based games. (The other being D2).
---
They'll have to! Concrete is terrible but at least there are reliable ways of getting it! I have no clue how to get cork, other than junk extractors... That's gonna take forever!
---
Hold up. What is Wendigo Colosuss? 
---
Good info thank you but ive been gone for a bit and that sounds sweet.
---
The lake to the east of harpers ferry. You can place your camp on the debris floating in the water and have very shallow water 360 degrees around you. I have 14 industrial purifiers and could easily place more if I wanted to.
---
Got ya. Thanks anyway.
---
hell, i donated another 250 after the switch, so. another 120,000 people to feel like that'll do it
---
The concept of a glass cannon is that the cannon is powerful but also immensely fragile. Bloodied builds are at the point that they are extremely strong and have very little risk attached to them. Its gotten to the point that even a junkies build which has the risk of addictions attached to it still does not hit the mark that bloodied builds are at. Its not a matter of nerfing bloodied builds but buffing or balancing other builds to also be viable. In other games with glass cannon builds, the glass part of the build is prevalent. For example, i have fought many glass cannons in the darksouls franchise. Those sorcerers can very well one shot me but at the same time it is balanced because i can one shot them. With bloodied builds, this is not always the case with all the perks that reduce damage and even sometimes ignores it.
---
Yeah, as others have predicted and said, they doctored the numbers by both boosting how much was actually turned in and lowering the goal so it looks more believeable.  They will do it with the next ones as well, as they now know it will fail otherwise and make them look even worse.  I honestly haven't seen anybody on xbox up there yet donating anything, and check the map often.  Just more lies from them to try and save face.
---
I ready logged out after like 45 min after I bought it and nothing im hoping maybe when I log back in ill get it or idk it fucking sucks probally another bug introduced by the new update maybe
---
I only have the same sources. I bet cork gets lowered. 200,000,000 is even more ridiculous.
---
And you are one person. So it equals out
---
Amount of stuff. I don't care about location.
---
I‚Äôve thought about going 50 cal because of this but I like an insanely fast Gatling. :)
---
It also has solid collision data so you can stand on them or get pinned by its placement.
---
Sounds about right, concrete is hard to come by as well. Was reading another post saying something like 300 or so possible on a server through farming locations, which is just a completely asinine concept when you think about it.
---
  How do we have so little of a material available to players for farming?
---
lol 600+ hours like that, i'll turn em off next time
---
When you realize the hit box is the zipper itself you also come to the realization that it's genius!  Makes it harder for creepers to steal your stuff when you drop for a friend
---
There isn‚Äôt really a we here. Just you. And I haven‚Äôt downvoted you once lol. 
---
The point of the vote system is so ppl can up/downvote if they agree on something or not. No one‚Äôs stepping on you, they just don‚Äôt agree with you. That‚Äôs all. 
---
I don‚Äôt care where you voice your opinions. It‚Äôs no problem to me if you disagree. I enjoy other perspectives from the game, doesn‚Äôt mean anyone has to agree with you or that we‚Äôre stepping on you for not taking this anger srly
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt make this pass very doable either. I have done every daily and weekly score challenge and the repeatable one tons of times since this has started (41 days ago)! I am rank 86 now. I‚Äôm so burned out but can‚Äôt give up now lol.
---
heh, WAY more
---
Ok i like it a lot. For that extra point, what if I took out last laugh and conc fire. Then used all three points for Fire in The Hole? Not a huge buff or nerf. Just kind of cleans up and allows me to engage from much further away.
---
I especially enjoyed the black powder ones. Very satisfying to use and a good change of pace compared to my shotgun build.
---
I have 8 ammo converters...send him my way.
---
Exactly. Bloodied combined with perks and armor aren‚Äôt glass cannons. A glass cannon would mean they take damage very easy. And they don‚Äôt.
---
junk
---
All they had to do was keep building on Wastelanders.  It should have been more quests for reputation, more ways to get treasury notes, and more Wayward missions.
---
My experience with events like this in other games is that they're done to artificially remove stuff from the player economy.
---
I won't be surprised when they add in player instances and, surprise, it costs tons of the same materials to build.  Then, new Vault 94 raid costs like 20k caps to enter.
---
Edit:  Reworded
---
They should also update the event calendar because that one still talks about 150 mil concrete. In any case, I hope this will make them reevaluate the requirements for some of the upcoming goals.
---
Miscommunication from the garbled radio broadcast the over zealous wanna be BOS guy F'd it up.
---
The one with the Mirelurks? Cause I went to a house that seemed like it was nothing but books in it and I just kept picking them up for some reason.
---
With not enough concrete there is no BOS and Bethesda can delay the DLC release. This all part of the plan, folks.
---
Ngl i started my bloodied build off wanting to be able to run junkies for ranged and tbh its a pretty good mid ground.     I have a junkies plasma gat and ive been putting some points in heavy gunner but this is only for sbq and other bosses but everything else is bloodied shotty/melee
---
A true glass cannon would be something like a beserkers build but it falls short because the damage increase is still not as good as bloodied.
---
I was expecting this to be more like D2‚Äôs season passes, where they can be maxed out in a couple of weeks with barely any effort. With any luck, someone will find an score glitch at the last minute to save me, or Bethesda is about to make a lot of money from atom sales (_Insert Benny‚Äôs ‚Äòrigged from the start‚Äô speech here_)
---
I just got it after about a month and 40 tickets and I noticed I can‚Äôt modify it but I haven‚Äôt tried repairing it.
---
That sounds right. It‚Äôs got a few hundred burnt books inside. Easy cloth farm.
---
The turtle test! Hahaha! Take your damn upvote!
---
No new currency.  They just want all your junk in their trunk.
---
I don't know the dark souls franchise so take what I am about to say with a grain of salt. Is that your experience PvPing in dark souls? I didn't know dark souls had a PvP aspect. I am pretty sure everything I said was what you said other than your personal experience in a game I don't know.
---
You can mine it from a workshop or buy it bulk from the ammo machine but honesty the goals aren‚Äôt realistic and the rewards aren‚Äôt worth it
---
I have a ve 50 and sometimes have to switch to my vffr gatling just because of the huge ammo consumption on the 50. There is never an easy middle of the road, best we can do is work with what we have.
---
Has to have ten or more weapons or alot of junk for me. I'm not a trader or anything like it so I usually only check out player vendors If I need some cheap scrip, or I am waiting for another event to pop. Thing that drives me nuts tho is people selling awful weapons with terrible legendary prefixes for alot of caps. I sell my junk script for next to nothing and I can't keep it in stock. Experienced players need alot of junk scrip for their alts so if you sell cheap enough they will buy out everything you have. Rather have stash space than extra caps.
---
Amount of plans.     Been trying to get as many as possible so the more plans someones vendor has the more it makes me wanna scope it out
---
I have hundreds for sale on xbox
---
From the fissure go north and West till you see a cave.  The acid mode is in the cave, the lead mode is on the cliff.  You have to experiment placing your camp unit to get both.  I think you have to place it halfway up the cliff.
---
I'm sure once it's your job you probably don't want to go home and deal with anymore, kind of like when I was a chef. I would just bring home whatever I could because fuck cooking after a long shift.
---
Just on the terminal. Don't want those spies snooping around.
---
Amazing build this is the best one I have seen so far after thousands of hours into this game .
---
there was a god mode glitch for xp a few weeks ago but i believe it was patched out
---
I always miss the good stuff...
---
Terminal? Realy?
---
Do the same number at each relay tower, compare what you get from each
---
He's a rare spawn right now where he's a legendary enemy but he only has about 5%~ to spawn right now if you nuke  certain areas. 
---
Bethesda will be adding an Event in about 2 weeks where he spawns as an actual Event Boss if you nuke a certain mine and groups of 8 players at a time can go challenge him (Unlike the Scorchbeast Queen the whole server won't be gaining up on him).
---
You get it from golf balls, pipe weapons, and some other rando items I can't think of the top of my head. I do believe it's main use is for armors and modifications.
---
This game is absolute trash. Are people still realizing this in 2020?
---
Sure they do! ......55% of the time!
---
O wait cant forget about blocker,dodgy, lone wanderer,sentinels and SS armor putting out 300+ DR. .... and 30+ agility so theyre invisible.....
---
There is an invasion mechanic in darksouls and a large pvp scene that was born from that. The way glass cannon stay alive is by avoiding attacks through timed dodging. Of course in fallout 76 this is reduced to a perk which does really require much skill at all. Which is completely fine because they are different combat systems. However because bloodied builds can just tank shots from larger targets most of the time it doesn‚Äôt really make them glass cannons. They are just heavily irradiated cannons.
---
Then why is it the same damn topics on the front screen with the same "DoeSnT PlAy ThIEr GaMe" being parroted too, it's a bit of a circle jerk in here at times.

They just, erm, cough, changed the goal posts.
---
Agree. Playing with little kids is very weird. Block no thanks Chris Hansen.
---
IIRC the SBQ doesn't take explosive damage anyways, only ballistic. IDK if that would've made the gauss shotgun null to her or not. Either way she's usually just out of range most of the time with the gauss unless you're nearly directly below her.
---
There is we, it's the pvp community who I am very vocal amongst or I wouldn't be here saying this at all.  I don't care about "number of likes" in a facebook sense and I'm starting to think you're being belligerent with me on purpose.  We can't be heard if our opinion is always being buried, it's as simple as that.  And don't gimme that In not included in you stuff, you're sitting here arguing with me about the point of this conversation are you not?  If you didn't downvote congrats, your cookie is in the mail.  I'm asking the general non-pvp crowd to stop stifling our posts when we are trying to help everyone by asking the devs to provide us with distinct spaces.  Is there anything else you'd like me to explain again?
---
They do. But this damage can be negated with planning like any other game that has glass cannons. That's my point. I think Bethesda did it well because if done right other builds can have the same (not exaclty) effect.
---
There was a quest in wastelanders that sent you to a house that a friend of the overseer's or maybe the wayward lady lived.... Spawn in at Helvitia I think and turn right.  That house has like 100 books in it.
---
I will say the potentially unpopular, "Thank you Bethesda for listening to your players!" Ya done good.
---
We are quick to criticize, we should be just as quick to praise.
---
I remain hopeful that my new little squishy will soon be able to complete her vaccination and adventure forth into the wasteland.

If your tired of getting killed easily maybe Bloodied isn't the way to go?

All platforms.:)

For most games consoles have more players than PC and steam is a subset of PC meaning it‚Äôs an even smaller piece of the pie.

Do you think steam has more players than Xbox or pa4?

Also Line in the Sand circle jerk loot all meat piles, you get 4-6k Steel if you're landing hits on all of them.
---
Dude. You just negated your argument. If you can negate the damage, then it‚Äôs not a glass cannon. 
---
Or you don‚Äôt understand what a glass canon is, and just are repeating what you‚Äôve read other people say.
---
I agree for the most part, but complaining about the armor and the way the place looked weren‚Äôt really points. However, you do seem like an asshole considering that you decide to resort to insults instead of communicating like a normal person. So I bid you adieu.

They don't have good Business Inteligence. It cannot be that hard to achieve a good estimate of how much concrete the player base can pick in X days base on how much they already collected. 
---
This event only proves that they are not taking good insights bases on their data. They are simply taking decisions based on bad intuition.
---
A long time ago I had a glitch where I moved my camp, and among the stored items were those big white defensive walls. For whatever reason, they multiplied and I had thousands of them stored for absolutely no reason. I ended up scrapping them all because they fucked up my budget, and ended up with an immense amount of concrete. Not wanting to keep it all since it came from a bug, I got rid of all but a few hundred. Safe to say that about a year later I definitely wish I'd kept it all.
---
Its only a problem with bosses for me tho.    I started switching it up before traveling to the sbq fight.  Or if im running with higher level friends.        Tbh. I never really enjoyed being a PA user in previous fallouts.      I guess maybe its something wrong with my build then
---
Your post had little to do with that. Just a post about the fixer with a side comment that you play pvp. Whatever you wanna tell yourself though. I‚Äôm told Bethesda responds a lot better to poor attitudes. Have fun convincing others that pvp is important when you act like this. Should be fun for all of us!
---
Reddit isn't a good place to gauge a game almost every game I enjoy playing their sub reddit echoes like this. There was even a similar event for people turning in some kind of tokens from grinding mobs and everyone said the end number was fixed too...it's like a bunch of NPCs talking.

Hey, if you want to release a new console that takes cartridges, I'll gladly buy that.

I'm pretty sure I only have 46 cork from when i used the junk shield perk.

Well 150,000,000 and 200,000,000 was ridiculous. I mean gnomes, bags of concrete and gravel pits were the only sources for concrete.

What kind of monster would steal from Grandma?

No, probably not.
---
Why you may ask? Because I guarantee that the current canon probably uses this expedition to Appalachia to explain how the BOS made it to the East Coast.
---
I like this idea. Its similar to Vigors food system. Except in that, its a timed event and the more food you put in the better the rewards. But there's check points where you get a chest
---
Unfortunately it seems that Patch 21 broke An Ounce of Prevention quest most likely thanks to that change they made to the quest listed in the patch notes and it broke some instance quest areas this includes areas used by the Cheating Death and From Russian with Lev quests.
---
Sorry man....Trust me this hurts me just as much.....Kinda like a humor through the pain kinda thing....... Honestly I think this game could have been one of the best games and not only that but one of the best fallout games ever.......I'd secretly always wanted to be able to explore the fallout universe with    other people but their reliance on outdated tech and cash grabbing motives by the big wigs......I just wish they had put all the heart that has been present in all of the older games into this one......As well as just listening to their community......This game could have truly been something special
---
The items are static and can't be interacted with.
---
Such are the drawbacks of an online RPG.
---
I've been planning on this
---
The whole point of running a glass cannon build in any game is to deal as much damage as you possibly can while being as tanky as possible , dude.
---
Yeah, but I have to shoot more things to scrap more things to make more bullets to shoot more things to scrap more things...
---
This is a fun post.
---
As a VATS crit build, ANYTHING that can turn invisible is awful for me. Assaultrons included.
---
No you cant
---
Lol
---
It's pretty easy getting inside...all the weapons an armor cannot be picked up or equipped even though it says it can but junk is loot able.
---
Um... no
---
Nice try. Doesn't work like that
---
Commence waiting.
---
Those all work for any other build type.
---
I mean I'm s full health no PA no mutation non vats commando build and I do pretty well for my self with both killing things and not being killed. Do I have the same damage output as a Bloodied? Maybe not but if I decide to grab my quad assaultron head I can hit for 3700ish but normally run a non legendary fixer with an auto 38 receiver for the hell of it and still kill things well because of the damage per second not damage per shot. 
---
I guess just play the way you want to not the way everyone on YouTube tells you too
---
YES enormously.
---
Don't collect notes, holotapes, junk or common outfits.
---
Scrap all your atomic shop outfits not in use.
---
Complete as few quests as possible (fewer undroppable keys)
---
 No
---
its a looter shooter

Power armor pieces scrap for steel

I mean, how was I supposed to respond? Oh I‚Äôm so sorry u/OwOThrowMeAway! How could I ever correct some parts of your post! Please, use me as your door mat and spit bucket! 
---
If you would have responded normally this could have been a normal and fair conversation, however you instigated it when you decided to go ahead with the insults.
---
Yeah but you could still cripple her wings easily with shotguns, even if you didn‚Äôt do much damage ...
---
You shouldn‚Äôt if you use he same Bethesda account but you should contact support
---
If you don‚Äôt care then you wouldn‚Äôt respond
---
Considering this game takes place so soon after the war and the fact that gold bullion is never mentioned or used in any of the other Fallout games as a currency I'd say things are looking pretty grim for it catching on. In fact gold is shown as something not worth the trouble, despite the value, because of its weight in Dead Money.
---
It was a blue bag call "vault" something, even if i take all that am i in danger?
---
Many weren't going to put it in knowing it was unrealistic. I think they are going to move it now (like me and my 3k concrete).
---
Wow, that‚Äôs a terrible hit rate. Sorry it‚Äôs been such a lousy result for you. 
---
I‚Äôm curious ‚Äî what platform are you on? I‚Äôm on xbone and haven‚Äôt had nearly that bad luck. I have all 5 Unyielding pieces with 3 stars ‚Äî not all amazing stars but decent after maybe 76 or so total rolls. (I didn‚Äôt count exactly but I got my first one in maybe 8 rolls and the longest was less than 2 dozen.)
---
I'd rather knock off smiley for all those times he held out on me, pretending that it hasn't been a month since he had any bullion.  Yeah, I'll come back next week...
---
I would assume that the buracratic wheels at Zenimax Bethesda are just as fast as the US Congress. They probably saw the mistakes and it took em some time to address it. I'm just glad they are addressing it.

Ps4
---
It tells you about the event on the start screen before the menu.
---
Might as well change it for cork now.
---
Doubtful. Someone dropped a bunch of stuff in a bag. The numbers don‚Äôt sound outrageous but who knows.
---
I'm in north America, I don't have a set time yet. Today was my first try
---
While I'd like to say the treasure hunter event for having a stupidly unfair drop rate, this event is taking the cake for making us all waste resources.
---
the fuck difference does it make whether they moved the number or the goal post? its the same result. it was obvious that that bethesda would either have BS one side or the other.
---
its funny that people actually thought that bethesda would actual let the event fail. 
---
regardless, clearly you have issues dude.
---
You will be fine and you won't get banned for it
---
The best place to put them is in a garbage can sand be done with them.
---
You will learn soon enough how useless they are.
---
lul, dont participate and they will lower it even further. joke devs
---
Im not asking how to play though..... Im asking what armor to start going for now that i can gring bullion ya dumbo. Maybe you should fully read the post before replying so aggressive
---
I'm in Australia, so by the time I start to play after work youll be asleep lol
---
Agreed, the inability to trade, even among characters on the same account is a drag.
---
Ahh.  I see you made it to Fallout 1s endgame as well.  So satisfying to roll up to a totally deserted Shady Sands.
---
The Fixer uses mods from the Combat Rifle, so if you don't have it yet for the combat rifle you may be able to find it at a vendor or by scrapping combat rifles.
---
That‚Äôs unlucky. I try to get 3 placements before I even turn visible. As someone else mentioned you can usually just spin in place and drop the CAMP unit without even moving.
---
Yea, better be safe than sorry, i healed myself and left it there. (Also knowing how Bethesda deal with people with alot of stuff when they released the game xd)
---
4 mil was the number after 1 day. It wasn‚Äôt updated for 2 days. Seems pretty reasonable to be at 12 after 3 days...
---
Yeah in an in-game RP way I'd never know. Even though he's like "THE BROADCAST!" and I'm thinking "The one I can barely hear? You hearing secret messages, bro?"
---
No, I agree about consoles. But I believe without being able to prove it in a substantial way that Steam players are higher than the Bethesda launcher. I also think the downward trend visible in Steam's active player numbers are affecting all platforms in a much larger way than is being accounted for even with Game-pass. Game is in a rough state at the moment in my opinion and its been a long stint of back to back controversies with every recent patch.
---
Just move on if youre not going to actually help i can careless how you play if youre not running bloodiedüëå
---
"There is an invasion mechanic in darksouls and a large pvp scene that was born from that." That's really cool. I didn't know that was a thing.
---
I found a spot that had junk and lead. Saves me time.
---
Not rare, flamer mod to it is craftable. I save mine for novelty occasions as well :). Cloth sack on my head and a mechanic suit for some texas chainsaw michael myers antics at low lvl events lol
---
High level players usually use the wayward as a place to drop extra supplies that take up inventory space. That bag was mean for anyone to take what they need, no worries or questions asked.
---
Then all the more reason to #NukeATLAS.
---
Because they didn't set the skin textures up to be a dynamic outfit. It is part of the character looks menu.
---
We get access to 4, there are 8 or 9 in total.
---
Haven‚Äôt heard they‚Äôre making a winery and one of the first drinks is going to be the ad Victorian red wine!

It wasnt on the usual paper bag, it was in a shiny vault tec gym bag, thats why i got worried
---
i rock heavy gun builds, or at least trying too
---
What does Commie bot collect?
---
Well no shit, but bloodied can still take advantage of them on top of the massive damage and special special boosts. Bloodied is NOT a glass cannon. Qhen done right you can tank hit after hit....glass bjilds cant do that. Damage avoidance js one thing but massive damage reduction and resource pools is another.  Berzerkers is much closer to being a glass cannon than bloodied.
---
Corks r hard to get neither.
---
That is literally NOT what a glass cannon is. Being Tanky is the opposite of glass cannon.
---
You literally have no idea what you are talking about. 
---
Once again you have negated your own argument. 
---
https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/glass_cannon
---
The definition literally used the word tank to illustrate what the opposite of glass cannon is. You know what you said a glass cannon is meant to be. Tanky. 
---
So you‚Äôve been proven wrong. By your own words. Now you must change your mind as per your stated challenge.
---
Sadly I don't think most players here want PvP.
---
Wait, does the content of the drop change depending on where you called it..?
---
It's a free cosmetic, not sure if you can still "claim" it from the Atomic Shop.
---
I know some people had issues with their modded cameras returning to defaults every time they logged in, until they fully completed the bucket list.
---
Thought maybe it was a similiar interaction. Maybe not.
---
The vault tec bag is just the newest atom shop skin for loot bags. No need to worry my friend
---
That isn't what a glass cannon is, imagine a glass cannon as a glass cannon, it's very very fragile and can break very easily but will wreck anything anything in front of it
---
Cork is nowhere near as scarce as concrete. Not only can you get it from pipe weapons, you can also get it from globes, crystal decanters, baseballs, and golf balls (which is notable when considering the multiple golf-related areas in the game). Hopefully they'll significantly lower the numbers there too, but it's definitely not the same sort of situation concrete's in.
---
In what way if I may ask? I have a berserker build that does die and can kill just as fast as my bloodied build.
---
Oh, then i should have took all that stuff xd
---
'not very "Good"' - lol, just a bit of an understatement.
---
Its always been amusing to me that so many current FO players seem to think the BoS  are the bad guys. Meanwhile the Enclave actively hunts down and destroys entire populations of innocent people in their mission to purge all non-pure beings - and no one bats an eye. In fact, lots of players like yourself glorify them.
---
I just think its amusingly ironic that players would shit all over the BoS and label them nazis, fascists, etc - just because they don't necessarily play well with others - yet don't seem to care that the Enclave's main goal, aside from supremacy, is the extermination of any lifeform that is not a pure human being.
---
Now granted, if you haven't played past FO games you might not be aware of how sinister the Enclave actually is - but its always best to learn some history before throwing labels around.
---
I suppose, if Bethesda does the Enclave \*right\* - and doesn't water them down (who knows in todays political climate) - the trendy anti-BoS crowd will finally see that they've been directing their ire towards the wrong faction...
---
  
---
A couple snippets for those interested:
---
" The perceived ideology of the Enclave stems from their conviction that its members are the sole representatives of humanity: Unlike humans outside the Enclave's shielded facilities, few, if any, members of the Enclave were exposed to nuclear fallout and other harmful factors present in the wasteland. As a result, the Enclave is largely hostile to all entities and species in the wasteland.  "
---
" Regardless of services rendered, the Enclave considers most humans outside its ranks as equal to super mutants and ghouls: Abominations to be destroyed so that "true humanity" could take its place as the "real" America. "

Thanks

I took a photo of me looking out into the flames, looks pretty cool. Wish you could apply filters and stuff later as I don't have time to fine tune it while someone might kill me...
---
Probably, but now you made someone else happy more than likely. So hopefully karma is on your side now.
---
The other day I dropped my CAMP in Morgantown and just built a porta-potty.   You can stand inside and not clip through.  I'd go into photo mode and be able to see what was happening outside.  Several times someone would walk up to a nearby crate and I'd pop out of the porta-potty and gun them down.   
---
Forget being a bush wookie- I'm a porta-potty Ewok.
---
M79 or Auto Grenade Launcher? Or does it not matter?
---
The forager is the old man but I agree lol
---
Yea, at least i got a free rad clean and health restore xd
---
The responses are set. Over on the foundation side, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you do, they will act as if Jen‚Äôs mom is dead and the army folk will act like you killed the SS ghoul. Assuming it‚Äôs the same on craters side.
---
Well if you have a bloddie build with full unyeilding you should take a look and your perks because you already have the best legendary armored for a bloddied so maybe you just need to rework your build a bit or or the kind of armor you have is just lacking in resistance so just go for SS armor and hope for another unyeilding set but good luck with that
---
You'd have been so overweight you'd probably have ended up dropping most of it anyway.  Not sure how much all of those weigh, but the stims would have been 500 pounds total.
---
holy shit you are triggered lmao.
---
Steel was easy to get. Concrete is a bit rarer. Cork is gonna be tough. I never had a need for it.
---
So the question now, is there any reason _not_ to #NukeAtlas? The BOS are evil, their rewards are bunk, and we don't even get the best power armors from them (Enclave and Secret Service got yo back).
---
I can only think of this point: you've run out of keycards
---
Back off Brotherhood of Steal.
---
Again, it‚Äôs a top 30 game on Xbox
---
Edit: number 16 on Xbox right now. 
---
Super conservative estimate is 8k steam, 10K Xbox, 10K PS4, 2K Bethesda launcher, and nobody playing Xbox gamepass pc lol (see how 30k is an absurdly ultra conservative estimate)
---
&gt;Bethesda is literally admitting they fucked up with these numbers and is taking community feedback to bring them into achievable range and you're still being a bitch about it.
---
Oh, did they make a public statement?  
---
I was assuming they did it quietly and sneakily? That changes things.
---
Nah, the budget bricking is punishment enough
---
Considering how the game works, I doubt you‚Äôve found any holotapes in chronological order. Maybe a few, but they‚Äôre spread out and mostly recorded at random times. Most don‚Äôt even mention the date
---
I totally understand, you don't fight back, you take it and server hop. I got fallout first, endless supplies, and honestly I do it to farm salty posts on reddit. If ya look up a dude named sinseer he's my biggest fan. It's kinda hilarious now that I think about it. Thinking about compiling all the times he mentions me to be my outro to my videos,
---
- Bag of Dogwood Fertilizer
---
Nah, you're fine bro. A lot of high levels just have too much stuff and rather it goes to a newer player. 500 stims seems either a bit exaggerated, or it's possibly duped. Don't go out of your way to do major exploits/ dupes yourself, and don't bother with magic/ legacy weapons. Also the Vault-tech bag is a free bag variant that you can get out of the Atomic Shop. At this point a majority of the player base has been exposed to the Duped christmas presents that have been flying around, and even then if u found or received a few hundred I wouldnt sweat it. Bethesda could easily have adressed this but they won't because of extra exposure to the public.
---
I‚Äôm a power armor heavy build, so I was just wondering if one was glitched and the other wasn‚Äôt. Auto will probably wind up lighter due to my perk choices, so I‚Äôll go with that. Thank you.
---
It has been bugged since launch.
---
Only ranks 1 and 2 give immunity to self-harm from ballistic explosion damage. Rank 3 does not.
---
His comment is aggresive? Look at your reply to him. Maybe you should realise that bloodied isn't for everyone and from the look of your post, you are one of them. Go look up some vids instead, if you can't accept people commenting.
---
I just read the wiki you linked to. And it proves I am correct other than it doesn't go into the gaming part of you want to be as defensive as you possibly can. FO76 let's you be very defensive as a low health build (so does a blizz sorc in Diablo 2). I didn't make the game. You literally don't know the history of glass cannons. Play Diablo 2 sometime.
---
Because she's a Hippie.
---
Thats BS, maybe kill normal monsters just as fast, even a jjnkies 10mm pistol double taps most enemies... But when stacked against tough enemies such as SBQ the damage difference is significant. Bloodied gets a 160% damage boost ,berzerkers gets a 50% buff. Thats 110% difference, add sneak and headshot muiltipliers vs enemies DR and bloodied does significant amount more. A bloodied lever sneak head shots for 3500, a junkies ( same damage as berzerkers with much more survivability) hits for 1500... thats not even close. Hell a bloodied build can use a quad,vampire or Supressors weapon and still do the sames damage as a berzerkers/junkies but have 4x tbe capacity, healing or further damage reduction .
---
Thats not even getting into the special advantage bloodied adds.
---
This is what happens when you double down on grinding. (Basically) nobody in the community really wants to do it. Same reason why so few people went for Vault 94 emote
---
I'd also advise people loot the petrified corpses while looking for stimpaks in NW. They're actually useful in this mode and have a significant chance of dropping stims!
---
Happens to me all the time with my handmade but haven't noticed with my fixer. I've never been able to fix it by sprinting, always have to swap to 1st and aim to fix it
---

---
You've been given perfectly good advice on steel, but if you don't want to kill things for it, there are a lot of hangers in Whitespring if you look around.  I always hit those up when I'm visiting.
---
Lead isn't as easy as steel, but there are a few good spots to remember on the doc I linked.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt think the issue with bloodied is with, well, bloodied.  I find most of the issue with Unyielding.  The bloodied prefix rewards your risk with extra damage.  Unyielding on the other hand makes it so can carry more, refresh AP faster, sneak better, have better VATS accuracy, get better prices, pass skill checks, get more XP, increases your crit speed, makes hacking/lockpicking easiet, can make you harder to kill... did I miss anything?
---
I‚Äôm running a commando with a 2\* Mutants/25% fire rate handmade, use adrenal reaction, and a full set of 5 unyielding and I‚Äôm in no danger due to the my super high sneak, and serendipity helps out a lot there as well. Meanwhile, it also allows me to get some massive damage boosts from adrenal reaction and the sneak attack damage.
---
The ability to sneak like that takes out a lot of the risk, and the stat boosts give me huge boosts when I‚Äôm not even in any danger.  Throw on all the other mutations, put me on a team, and throw on strange in numbers and I‚Äôm sitting there with stats in the mid 30‚Äôs
---
So I think Bloodied itself is fine.  I think bloodied with adrenal reaction is fine, to make the glass cannon as you stated.
---
Unyielding is the issue, not that I would expect them to change it
---
Old senile Smiley has come to his senses and stopped resetting his gold bullions for sale after exiting/reentering. So sad.
---
Who cares? Free shit is free shit lol
---
The in-game instructions are so fucking bad sometimes
---
It literally proves you wrong. You literally proved yourself wrong. And just are to immature to admit it.
---
Ohhh. Well thanks. I will do a little research on him.
---
Yeah they just changed it today.
---
Finally a voice of reason. I think lower health and higher health builds need to meet in the middle other than DPS.
---
Then keep playing 4 I honestly don't get it.  Knew what it was when you bought it right?
---
Genius.
---
They're not really new, its just that events use to be the draw for events. It's just that due to the repeatable being xp people are just using events as kill boxes.
---
It was in the Overseers canp, so the stash was close by like 2m away
---
I did that for my last terminal after all lol. I wasn't in the mood of traveling around üòÇ thanks for the tip!
---
Actually, those extractors are a lot lighter on server strain than an equal amount of place able objects.
---
IIRC, you will lose all progress, but you should check
---
Happens to me with any gun if I try to sprint out of a crouching position while trying to aim. I either have to go into VATS or go into first person and tap the aim trigger to get it to go away
---
I might not run a bloddied build but I do have about 850 hours in the game and understand how most builds work. I've looked into alot of different options as far as play style goes and found what works for me. Best of luck with you "meta" build....
---
I think you need to look up the history of glass cannons buddy, not the other way around.
---
Yes, sorry I'll fix that wiki.
---
I put that info on the bottom about the energy bobbleheads working but forgot to explicitly point out grounded.
---
They both check for the same keyword :)
---
At this point it's only about weapons so I look for vendors with the highest amount.  I also like find vendors and see if they're in a group which I'll join and then travel to their camp for free.
---
They are trying to empty people‚Äôs scrap boxes. It is the only thing that makes sense.
---
An easier solution to this problem is to provide more benefits to being at full health or near to full health. This way bloodied builds can keep their unyielding armor and other builds dont have to be so close to dying to benefit from that legendary effect.
---
I agree but someone with extensive knowledge of the lore after the fact might assemble a recommended listening order. Categorization would be nice too like this is the story of the free states, responders, BOS, etc.
---
I hear what you‚Äôre saying though, it all sounds nice in theory but maybe isn‚Äôt practical.
---
Bloodied will do a lot of damage if you're a low health build, which will have other benefits for a melee user.
---
Furious will be a little more limited as it increases damage per hit and unless you're needing to hit things many times you won't see much damage increase.
---
At LVL 270+ on 2 characters, I get very specific. Either Junk, Misc, or Ammo, by now, I've found or bought about all of the plans I want or need. One of my 270+ characters still buys ammo, so she'll go there looking for 10mm ammo at 1 cap each, if she sees it and it's 2 caps, she says fuck it and goes elsewhere. My guy might wind up needing some flux, and if he sees you've got a lot of junk, he might consider checking out what you've got with the idea that you have some flux he'll need. Location isn't as important to me as what the item categories the player is selling. If they've got 5 junk, not interested. If there's 100 Ammo, less interested but I still might go for the heck of it.
---
Plans are great for your vendors though, lots of players will need them, lots of players don't want to sink the time and effort into finding them. 
---
I started a new character to use just for the leveling up challenges, so my higher-level characters have been dropping him a whole lot of plans for camp building. 
---
I think,  overall, players don't want to pay what the suggested price is on the plans, I sell camp-related plans for 25-50 caps, and they seem to move pretty well. Some of the armor, weapons, and mods plans that are harder to lay hands on, I sell those for under what the suggested prices are and they move. For instance, Marine Torso, I usually move those plans for 420, just a sort of arbitrary figure, but it always gets it out of my stash quickly. I put that same figure on all of the Marine armor pieces instead of 1200 that the game suggests.
---
Your best strategy is to go around to other vendors, check their pricing for things you're selling, and find that spot in your own conscience that you feel good about selling those things for.
---
Yes. The made a post telling us they were being unrealistic about the total for concrete needed. So they lowered it.
---
No real drama here. Move along.
---
Better example would be the rapid change of a rule in an event - during it's inaugural year.
---
I'm sure there are plenty of examples of it.  
---
Comparing the rules of the NFL (which has been around for how many years) is apples &amp; oranges.
---
Look up Combat Rifle in... -&gt;  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR\_El8/edit#gid=2043760311](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=2043760311)
---
If you leave and go into a world where your camp spot is free, it will be back like normal
---
Not well played. Hack to fix outcome of dumb "event".
---
Wasn‚Äôt trying to cause drama, must have missed the post my bad. I was actually kinda excited about it
---
Yay! Your bitterness was rewarded! Being an asshole about a game finally paid off!
---
Who hoo! Look at you! We are all so impressed by you! 
---
Lol!
---
Frog legs should be banned in NW.
---
Fair enough.
---
That‚Äôs weird. I‚Äôve never had frame rate issues unless I have a bad connection or near someone with a bad frame rate. Might just be a PlayStation thing
---
You're not going to find the answers your looking for here. There is nothing you can do except make a new toon if it's not your kind of playstyle. The whole point of the Bloody build is you're giving away all survivability(staying on low health) for the high risk reward of doing more dammage. Glass cannons are the same concept in any game. It's possible you just didn't make your build well so either go watch some guides and do more research. Litterly every bloody build level 50 or 500 have the same exact issues. Word of advice for Reddit: don't start your post with a smiley face and then full steam jump down everyones neck. Hope you have a good night bro.
---
They nerfed it to oblivion. Used to be amazeballs, now it's trash.
---
Is this good or bad? Which event?
---
‚Äú This event is further proof that Bethesda doesn't play their own game ‚Äù 
---
I agree
---
YES
---
I did One Violent Night twice and both times half the room was made up of large pixels.   Extreme lag as well which caused my death a couple of times.   Never seen anything like that before.
---
What platform?
---
Yeah I noticed that too it‚Äôs kinda annoying... if you don‚Äôt mind me asking how did you get the thing next to your name that says ‚Äútricentennial‚Äù?
---
True, im just wondering how furious + 40% swingspeed would work well together, and if it would work better than bloodied &amp; 40% swingspeed. 
---
I try and keep my health topped off most of the time, and mostly view bloodied as a convenient "oh, i just got hit for HALF MY HEALTH. time to kill whatever just hit me."
---
Cheers. Noted. Still feels suss to me.
---
I know a lot of people say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt nerf, make other things better‚Äù but I don‚Äôt know how you could possibly buff all the other legendary prefixes to the strength of Unyielding without completely breaking the game.  
---
You can‚Äôt make an unyielding version for full health. DR/ER have diminishing returns, there‚Äôs no way to improve things like Nocturnals, Vanguard‚Äôs, Bolstering, or Mutants to the levels of unyielding.  
---
From a game design perspective, making it so unyielding couldn‚Äôt boost your stats past 15, or that you could only be under the influence of one unyielding effect would be the most ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù thing to do.  Of course, changing it would cause such an uproar after people have spent so much time farming gear (especially stuff like Secret Service)
---
PC
---
You can get junk lead near the top of the map
---
Yeah, and then it got shat on simply because it said pvp in it, you're clearly not reading anything I'm saying.  Never planned on this discussion being about that!  Round and round we go, get your fuckin head checked.  I didn't ask you to like pvp, I asked that (general) you not stifle our attempts to make the game better for everyone by instating separate servers.  Fuckin idiot.  I didn't generate the hostility.  Not in the game, not on this post.  Am I detecting a pattern? ü•ô üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I checked just now. We're a little over 12m, but they lowered the requirement to 15m.
---
There is no way to win, there is no stopping the player from constantly coming back. Caps are easy to come by, they are not a detterent, esp when he is constantly killing me.
---
What am i supposed to do just get turned into a skid mark over and over again when i can't even fight back because my weapons are broken? Rather just afk on a server that doesn't have try hard's so i can go back to playing the game with my bro.
---
Try them both, everybody's preferences are personal
---
By crater area?
---
Aight, ill go to deathclaw island and test out the new hammer.
---
pays off more than the constant bootlicking YOU do here.
---
Yes
---
No. By that I mean, they would make it a single player game in full. This is far less likely because it would take a lot more effort than just letting the players run a server with existing code.
---
&gt; And someone in charge of their armory who'll buy ammo.
---
How about this instead.
---
Enclave feels threatened by BoS's return, and wants to stockpile ammo &amp; munitions.  So you can trade ammo in for enclave tokens - and then in turn - for serums/serum recipes... (rather than grind out all the caps)
---
I have a friend who uses strength boosting gear and a furious swing speed super sledge. It‚Äôs an incredibly good weapon, and since it doesn‚Äôt necessitate low health, it also lets you tank. If it were me, that would be my choice.
---
I'm sure they will, or we wouldn't be able to use a lot of the prefabs.
---
Okay, let me see if I have this right. If a game let's me deal a ridiculous amount of damage the lower my health gets (plus other bonuses). I don't want to find a way to be as tanky as possible to circumnavigate the low health aspect of my current situation. But if the game allows me to do that by design it's broken?  But the game developers should fix it. Do I have that right?
---
Truthfully resources seem to be lacking.
---
How much of the pile/deposit has to be in the build area for it to have the extractor?
---
Frankly? I love this idea. Though I think it should scale with the cap value of the plans, and a mark up for ones the BoS would be interested in.
---
Caps and serums are meaningless to me at this point, but I'm 100% in favor of giving my ammo to MODUS instead of the BOS.
---
Ty for the advice. Im testing out the new hammer on some enemies so i can get a feel for how it meshes with my playstyle.
---
LOL Bethesda couldn‚Äôt even keep consistent with their own shitty idea ü§£
---
You can‚Äôt make a full health version of unyielding.  You can‚Äôt boost the existing effects to the strength of unyielding without breaking the game.  No amount of boosting the DR/ER of other effects will do anything simply with how they have diminishing returns.  A +15 to every stat from a full set has so many impacts and implications you simply cannot balance into
---
It also makes perfect sense in the Lore / RP standpoint.
---
Why would BoS really give a shit about a bunch of bottle caps?
---
this is all he does on this sub, bootlick and complain that people arent posting the right things.
---
Daily‚Äôs &amp; ammo, because I can spend 3 caps for a daily
---
You likely wouldn‚Äôt be able to, but you definitely can nuke them.
---
Oof, idk if we‚Äôre gonna finish tho it‚Äôs a lot of concrete
---
Take what you need. Leave it for the next person. Put your own contribution down when you get around to it. Have fun playing.
---
Base game is fine
---
I want my canvass bag :(
---
Very nice. How long did it take to build?
---
Completely true. I wanted to participate and for shits and giggles hit a few places around Atlas: Sons of Dane, etc not much concrete. I‚Äôm not going to farm it, sorry.
---
Half but you can definitely fit both within the area
---
The deluxe is just cosmetics.
---
There's a skeleton handcuffed with a bottle of water just out of reach. Then there's another chair in front of that with a skeleton watching them reach for it.
---
I said this as well and got yelled at. I can prove that most builds can handle all the content the game currently has. You don't need to be bloodied. It's just more efficient.
---
Here‚Äôs my thing - sure, the rewards from this is useless and taking our junk. But at least there isn‚Äôt any rng.
---
I feel like the level of whatever is in it changes based on area, when I was below 50 I did a tower in the forest and got stuff around my level but doing the tower by atlas sent me to the mire and it was all over my level
---
I‚Äôm going to say the initial tester build was about 12 hours, while this was closer to 8
---
I got a the red hardhat and white hardhat at Sonny's.
---
Or you could server hop 15 million times at monorail elevator. So many choices, it just works.
---
I was shocked that my scrapbox had almost 10k steel and as much cloth and soooo much of ...even fiber optics....  but 172 concrete..
---
Whats next?  Cigarettes???
---
i avoid picking it up since i do not do much base building..
---
I usually sell anything over 50 when im collecting the daily caps from vendors
---
I mean they get more out of it by selling it on game flip anyways. Dupers have no reason to even want to donate to BoS for some watered down christmas presents when they are still sitting on multiple toons loaded with presents.
---
BoS will hopefully be trading with gold for their wares. The caps budget probably won't work if the BoS start charging 12k caps for a chest piece right?
---
Due to the Secret Service and Strangler Heart PA pieces costing bullion, I would like to think the Brotherhood  will most likely be similar in style of purchase. A few thousand per piece and a sliding scale for the mods.
---
I would actually be ok with that
---
Haha good plan, let us know how you go
---
If ya actually pvped you could have your opinion. The only reason you think PvP is broken is because you get turned into a skid mark. It's boring because you've given up on trying. PvP is fun, you just give up lol. There is totally a way to win, it's using bullets to kill your opponent. There's different builds, you just gotta aim and kill the other player. It's not that hard. Workshops are where I farm for junk I don't need, by killing players in hilarious ways.
---
I have a little over 4k, no plans of donating it though.
---
You think this was an event?
---
&gt; This is probably the worst event I've seen in a game of this sort.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; There numbers needed are completely disconnected from reality.
---
&gt; The rewards are garbage.
---
&gt; There's almost nothing in-game to let you know the event is even happening.
---
It's also dumb from a story telling perspective. Why would we ever willingly give a weather controlling facility over to *anyone* let alone the BoS!? If anything we should be fortifying it against them.
---
Can you post your build?
---
Use this https://nukesdragons.com/
---
Did they adjust it from 150m to 15m?  I can‚Äôt recall but swear it was higher than 15m.
---
Killed it in 4 swings. That's about the same for the other hammer, the biggest differences being the supersledge has a naturally faster swinger than a sledgehammer, even with 40% on both hammers. I was able to kill the claw slightly faster, and i didnt need to take damage to get the full effectiveness of the damage boosting effect. Im going to look into it more, but so far its leaning towords the super sledge.
---
So this glitch relies on Fallout 1st? Count me out, but at least now I know that that‚Äôs a thing.
---
No one ever shows up to the event on my servers, so I have to solo it.
---
Dude. You are harboring so much hate and anger towards a game and people you will never meet. 
---
And you think people who are having fun with the game are the problem?
---
And say you don‚Äôt have all this hate and anger. It‚Äôs all right their in your words.
---
Lol. All because people like a game that you don‚Äôt.
---
The idea behind the event as a whole is very entertaining, it makes me think of Elite Dangerous and their events. I wish if we didn‚Äôt reach the goal, that the outcome would be different, like that one ship in elite getting stranded half way
---
This is a great perspective that I haven't seen and I like it.
---
So At 33 I got my chest piece!   I then went onto legs and had better luck.  1 left and 1 right leg in the first 10.  My armor strength (Non SS) is over 500 using all vanguard right now.  perhaps I need to change things up a bit but it seems I still die w/ that on often enough to wonder how I could survive w/ 300 like you guys say.
---
Good i guess, its the fortifying atlas event. donating mats. People went on and on about how bethesda wouldn't actual change something to stop the event from failing.
---
They now look really stupid.
---
Also, a word of advice - boost your strength as much as you can. I suggest SS shielded and armors with it, and eventually, a similar super sledge with + 1 str.
---
Lol made me chuckle
---
Well between your carry weight and the stash limit, you'd be able to keep all the stims, but not a whole lot else ;-)
---
FWIW, once you're up and running (higher level), none of that will be hard to come by, so it's not a huge deal.  I regularly vendor most of that stuff, and I really should start dropping some at the Wayward for new players.
---
You might find them a little hard to come by early, but that won't last too long.
---
Ok, so the gauss minigun can be had by maxing out the raiders and obvi those are best used in PA but I suppose it isn't necessary.  If you do want the tin can you have two good options depending on wether or not you like pvp, and they're both gotten from Regs at vault 79.  If you like pvp, strangler heart is the way to go cause it adds poison to every shot.  If you don't, or a higher defensive rating is just more important to you you'll want the T65.  The gun is much cheaper than either suit so I'd get that out of the way first.  Also, the gun will always be crafted as legendary so you can roll it until you get the one you want.  Hope that helps
---
PVP was actually the forefront of this game, the game was originally a clone of Rust/DayZ but set in the fallout universe, the whole "we want people to only encounter real people and let that be the drama" was ripped directly from DayZ. PVE was added in as an after thought hence why the game is a shit show, they are turning what was a multiplayer game into a single player game that you play with other people.
---
I apparently need to visit abandoned bog town still, 211 levels in üòÇ
---
I regularly dump my junk, and I only had around 100 Concrete. Grinding for the rest was stupidly tedious.
---
Exactly which makes it seem like this event has no audience
---
‚ÄúFuckin idiot... I didn‚Äôt generate the hostility‚Äù 
---
sounds like the pattern is you, but ok haha
---
Everyone here was talking about the fixer. Had nothing to do with pvp. I joked with you and you resorted to insults and claiming you‚Äôre part of a hated minority of a video game, while you three more insults with every post. If you can‚Äôt be respectful, don‚Äôt claim to represent others. You‚Äôre destroying other pvp‚Äôers chance at being taken srly.

I find my fixer with a 38 receiver to be a very effective weapon.
---
There's your answer then! Enjoy
---
I know, but as I said, no one ever shows up to this event, much less puts their tent down there as opposed to near the SBQ. It‚Äôs just not likely.
---
Issues with that is: im barely lvl 50 &amp; im broke lol. I dont even know where to start with getting SS armor. As for stat modifiers, i have the solar powerd perks, and if needed my character is designed for regular chem usage.
---
You don't even have to be the one that kills him. Just exist there.
---
Treasure Hunter was worse, as it actively made me feel bad.
---
The TH's were peaceful, kinda weirdly cute, and squeaked and ran when you attacked them.  I felt like an asshole for shooting one.
---
When I'd see them, I'd kill any mobs hostile to them and leave.
---
They should have been hostile and well armed mini-bossses, not cute lil' traders that should have been NPC's like Graham.
---
I never keep more than 50 concrete before this. I just ran around collecting it and donating it.
---
you can build 12 SE of The Whitespring above where the glowing behemoth lives.  There is a stream next to a cliff.
---
Go to the main page of this subreddit, you should be able to "change user flair"!
---
Be careful dropping this bag in Nuclear Winter it can cause you to be trapped!
---
I server hopped alot, could barely scrape together 500 over several hours.
---
This was the answer I was basically looking for. In regs's shop for ss I didn't see any unyielding so I was wondering if there was something else in ss that bloodieds look for.
---
Good to knowe xd, i just start olaying yesterday, im just level 7, so i thought it was a huge amount of stuff xd
---
all i have to say is they better stay away from my power armor, my laser rifles, and my nukes or me the brotherhood are going to have to have a little chat
---
Yeah I hear you. It's just that there's no way I'm storing all that in my stash to even take it out
---
My fast travel point seems to be random, there are 3-4 different spots where I spawn in. Really wish we had fast travel rugs.
---
Cork popguns. One good shot (fuck yeah, VATS build!) will put a cork in your plasma emitter. When the plasma hits the cork, it will be slowed by the air pressure in the barrel enough to heat the very end of it. It deforms under the heat and its own weight, and the next shot basically blows the thing apart... and you.
---
This is why the BOS prefers Laser-based weaponry. Little do they know... I'm keeping the glass for myself.
---
You can't buy unyielding, you craft with legendary modules and the effect is random so start praying to RNGesus
---
Afaik the only way to cancel is from the Microsoft website. In your account and active subscriptions.
---
bruh, earlier *today* you argued with a dude here, calling him a moron ect. you do this shit all the time. you comment on every post bitching about its existence, condescending and generally being a prick.
---
you are one of the whiniest bitches on this sub.
---
Nicely done, take this upvote as a demonstration of my appreciation!
---
Ah thanks! One last question does the collectron robot need to move to collect scrap or can I box him in?
---
That's awesome. You can tell a lot of work went into it. Thanks for sharing!
---
Good to know, thank you
---
I mean thats what it was called, a community "event" with stats tracked on an "events" page
---
There was one in the tunnel right by the Whitehouse that was similar, there was a ramp and a motorcycle and a skeleton hanging from the light fixture.  Good times.  I mean for me.  The skeleton didn't seem to mind either, I guess.
---
Do you know if it works with Friendly Fire? I have a shishkabob, but I half wonder if a flaming something else would be more effective
---
Make it harder for non-dupers to do this so they're forced to go to dupers and pay them?
---
It's hilarious that you're butting heads with people who also have to loudly signal their hate for the game but made a different assumption than you. Like, the same type of people who say 'Bethesda wants us to fail'/'Bethesda would never change the goal' are hardly """Bethedrones""".
---
They're actually more *cynical* in their hatred than you are.
---
Perhaps you could post your perk loadout, your armor stats, your weapon stats to allow people to help you tweak your settings, rather than becoming abusive towards them?
---
'I have some unyeilding armor, but it doesn't seem to help' is pretty low on actual information.
---
Oh, and the dying again and again? Me too, I try to figure out WHY, and what I can do to avoid it happening again. It's called LEARNING how to approach a situation correctly
---
just get the base game.
---
LOL! I never noticed the ramp, just the bike, and had no idea why it was there.
---
I was one of those dopes.
---
Alright. Then here‚Äôs some advice on the bullion grind - don‚Äôt rush. With the exception of maybe the thorn/solar/strangler/94 mask, none of it‚Äôs going anywhere. Just work with the legendaries you find, and slowly build your way up. If you have twisted muscles and all the two handed damage perks, you‚Äôll be okay for damage.
---
Now watch it happen when someone is riding one of the Mr Fuzzy rides in someone's camp üòÇ
---
Taking the picture in the lobby counted.
---
Thats funny as most are experiencing problem. Nope you haven‚Äôt kill ed a few things a gotten lag from meat piles. That‚Äôs believable
---
Prolly lost em even before then. Skyrim is where the last few brain cells finally atrophied though
---
Yup.  You're just reading the cliff notes.  I'm shocked.  I called you a duck, you said you weren't, then you quacked.  Tf are we talking about?  Obviously you've got an anti pvp bias so why would you not want us to have our own space?  That's my only point here man.  Feel like I'm beating my head on the wall.  Y'all downvote us just to be toxic to people that enjoy pvp is that not the case?  Then let us be heard and we can all go about our lives! ü¶Ü. PS I guess I'm sorry I hurt your little feelings by preferring the handmade?
---
This. There's no motivation to drain resources for "rewards" that are crappier than the Xmas presents.
---
Oh that one.
---
I worked hard to get 3,000 concrete. Glad they lowered the goal. Buying from vendors is the only efficient way.
---
I camp in the school's central... what do you call it? Spire? Tower? Anyhow, there's only a couple ways up, and it has incredible sightlines to the surrounding rooftops and the big square up front (gets a lot of traffic, oddly)
---
Finally a perk to look forward to
---
They‚Äôve had plenty of ‚Äúdata points‚Äù before and they haven‚Äôt changed. Either the staff for 76 is really bare minimum, they don‚Äôt care, or both
---
I really hope I get to see this one day, that would be amazing.
---
No thanks.
---
Of course because such an awesome person like you walked in head up king
---
Did they get nerfed? I swear, the Gutsy's have not been nearly the terror I remember them to be lately.
---
With the 50 super stims he figured you'd run out of ammo before he ran out of health.
---
I think you've either been in one too many rad storms or drank too much nuka shine friend.
---
I stealth shot an unkillable npc while he was sitting and he did the same thing.

im not even making a value statement about the game lmao. im talking about how the sub has reacted to the event. shit was defended by the usual suspects, that bethesda wouldnt pull some bullshit to make the event pass.
---
but no, if you criticize ANYTHING even tangentially related to the game, youre a hater. this is the shit im talking about.
---
I never have any more than 30 scrap of my least used junk. The only thing I keep over 100 of are repair materials or bullet crafting materials.
---
I drop stuff there somewhat often.  I'll drop rare outfits, 3\*'s,  plans, etc..  When you have everything thing want, and  your stuck at the 30k cap limit, full set SS god roll, the weapons you want... what's a man in  the wasteland to do??? other than make someone else's day.   I figure people will come and take what they want and be all happy... like find $100 on the ground.
---
Idk but I feel goooooooood brother
---
Totally agree.
---
I saw how much was donated of concrete on weekend and how much i have in scrap box and couldn't give any more. If you dont have fallout 1st and unlimited junk stash space makes this event even harder. 
---
If the dupers don't donate...GG 
---
I looked ahead and saw cork donate.
---
Where am i going to farm cork?
---
I would like the collectron which is cloth donate which im hoping is going to be easier to farm up.
---
I've noticed all the workshops are being used and no one is raiding them. I thought the people that hated the event would be raiding hardcore.
---
...
---
Hold off on them psychotats, dude.
---
This is how it should have been done. You go get a quest  that takes you to the often unused portions of the map where you find a pile of something "special." Then load up and return it. This would have taken 20 minutes for the devs  to create a quest line and maybe a day for the art department to create the lootable piles of "special" stuff.
---
I don't know if you meant me but.  I did look it up and I found this.    While fundamentally true, a glass cannon systematically refers to dealing as much damage while surviving your enemy.      The last part is vague but holds true to the point.                                                                  "The notion that there may exist a fundamental trade-off between damage output and survivability is pretty much a universal assumption of all combat strategy. So the¬†idea¬†of a glass cannon (as opposed to the specific term) has no doubt existed as long as people have thought about how to kill each other while avoiding being killed ‚Äî predating by thousands of years, for example, the use of actual cannons. In thinking about it, the King in chess might be considered a kind of ‚Äòglass cannon‚Äô (can take pieces in any direction, but only move one square at a time). The idea appears to be completely comprehended by even the earliest military strategy games (18th century Prussia) and by the 19th century emergence of¬†Kriegspiel¬†(Kriegsspiel - Wikipedia¬†)¬†was fully embodied: the rules of Kriegspiel allowed for all sorts of realistic military forces, including those of high damage output and low ability to absorb damage (like artillery). But I see no evidence that these were referred to as ‚Äòglass cannons‚Äô (German:¬†Glaskanonen). Rather, they were referred to as ‚Äòartillery‚Äô and ‚Äòinfantry,‚Äô etc."
---
Not worth playing with all the new bugs. Im not even logging on for score because the  meat pile lag or my alt stuck in the main quest thats not completable. Thought ill just fast travel around claiming workshops on my alt but spawn in and you move like your hungry thirsty limb damaged and low health but your not any. Big fun big fun.
---
And any lab space for all those test tubes and vials.
---
Lol I pvp all the time. My friends and I love fighting each other at workshops. Idc that you prefer it outside of wondering why you‚Äôre still playing a fallout game if pvp is such a big concern for you.
---
Idk how you expect anyone to care about what you want when literally all you‚Äôre doing is trying to throw insults and act like you‚Äôre emotionally superior man. I haven‚Äôt once insulted you and that‚Äôs all you‚Äôve been doing. I know exactly what you‚Äôre saying. I just don‚Äôt care. Act like a jerk and no one cares what you want. That simple.
---
If you want others to listen to you stop taking and making everything so personal. Otherwise, I guess you can keep beating your head on the wall. seems kinda painful tho
---
Finally another, wait... Urrghhh...
---
Just make sure you use some radaway when you wake up and maybe even some day tripper to help get you through the day.
---
I don't want bloodied nerfed, I want more options. Junkie's and Bloodied are the only good effects, just about everything else is pointless. Not only does this remove any choice from the player when they go to pick an effective build, but it makes for a boring economy where traders only want B2525 fixers.
---
The meat piles do it for me. Ever since I started running with a tesla this patch, any "fish in a barrel" event does this about halfway through (and if I am hitting a LOT of stuff, it can even CTD my ass). It usually clears up once I get most of the piles looted.
---
That's fucking hilarious. Welcome to the raider life. We have cookies.
---
I have no idea I don‚Äôt have a collectron I didn‚Äôt even know that was possible
---
It's not even an event. We don't interact, or team up to do anything. We just separately go and drop valuable junk into a box. We basically have no interaction other than maybe seeing another player dropping their valuable junk into a box. (Great, now I have "junk in a box" stuck in my head) The rewards are garbage too. You get a box of junk. Maybe if enough other suckers participate you will collectively get some janky community rewards, that they will probably implement regardless of the outcome of this "event". What could possible be fun about that?
---
My main is level 335, at this point it's scrip and flux.
---
My lowest is 75, which means plans and weapons. 
---
Location doesn't matter too much, plenty of high levels have camps in the Forest or Toxic Valley. I *will* check people's levels on the map and try to find the base of anyone higher than me. Those camps get checked first.
---
Doesnt help breaking the game before an event.
---
Ah no problem. I‚Äôll find out soon enough. Hahahaha.
---
Well, QFFR Tesla‚Äôs are pretty fun to use tbh, never had any FPS drops because of it. Maybe that guy had the legacy explosive Tesla.
---
Yeah, you're wrong.  They were working on multiplayer during FO4 at the same time as making ESO but it didn't make it unfortunately because ESO seems to have taken precedence.  This game as stated by Todd at E3 was always meant to be a multiplayer experience.  Y'all just cried so hard it got nerfed instead of fixed after the entire game was released too soon.  Don't go rewriting history.  All my ESO gear is legendary and the game works fine.  Also, there is a really good balance there too, with different modes for everyone.  For whatever reason the Fallout community is vastly softer and I'm really disappointed, equally confused.ü•ôüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Not at all the more funny then ever
---
The fucking difference it makes is that they didn't go into this thing planning to fake everything like halfwits lie you kept insisting.
---
Someone clueless twit at Bethesda genuinely believed there was enough concrete out there for people to turn in that many and seeing how fucking wrong that idea was they reassessed things and lowered the goal.
---
That's essentially the exact opposite of the popular theory among brain dead halfwits that the entire event and progress bar was fake to begin with and set to go up by set amounts so everything would just autocomplete by the deadline no matter what.
---
The progress bars are real and odds are slim to none they adjust them again after  this  so people better keep turning shit in.
---
Line in the Sand is not just pixel ridden it comes to a crawl.  Especially if someone places their tent across the fence/wall, so they spawn in the middle. . it was PAINFUL trying to collect all the fly riddled loot afterwards.  I gave up and left 1/2 of it behind. The pixels were massive the frame rate was small.
---
Nah you belong with the blood eagles not us. At least when we do something we do it to benefit ourselves
---
All my karma is saying byeeeee
---
They changed the goal to 15m instead of 150m
---
It takes about 30 sec for your character to finish loading in. The overweight is when it's loaded how much crap you're carrying, but hasn't figured in the extra carry weight from your armor or backpack yet.
---
Not a bug, just a slightly slow loading in process. Fine to ignore it.
---
Golf balls, globes, baseballs, and pipe guns is how I've managed to get some...but both concrete and cork aren't on my farm list that often.
---
Hmm, I think your on to something here
---
They forgot how to make a fun game
---
I get where you are coming from. And you are correct. That was the whole point of my post. But the end game isn't B2525 fixers. All builds in this game are viable. Depending on how much ammo and defense you are willing to sacrifice. And that's not a bad thing. Even though most will say different. It's a video game. Someone made it . Play it your way and enjoy it. Or play something else.
---
Steel or lead
---
If you have large junk stockpiles then don‚Äôt go for junk, if you‚Äôre low on most junk or just have decent amounts then a junk extractor would be good
---
Still looking for specific weapons and plans, so higher numbers in those categories helps make the decision. I do try to reduce travel cost though.
---
Lol thanks for the chuckle
---
Surprise, it's agent Grey and he faked his death, hence the corpse you find is labeled 'Agent'
---
I usually go to camps with 5+ weapons and armor, at least a few thousand ammo, 50+ plans and maybe some aid items. Never if it‚Äôs a camp in the forest, unless I look around the map and see that the owner is level 100+
---
I literally don't even know what you're saying anymore.  If you like pvp then why are you chewing up my patience trolling me instead of helping?  Go contribute to my discussion or something you demented shithead!
---
Thanks much for the great tips, I still have a ways to go before many of them will become useful (I‚Äôm only level 13) but I‚Äôll be referring back to this comment soon in the future!
---
Building group 
---
get cranberry relish + herbivore serum asap , gives 25% xp boost (loads of vids out there on how to farm  relish fast )
---
i started a new character last sunday , im level 63 now. less than 40 hours played.
---
Yep. People keep calling it a "Dupper trap" but I'm with you. I think that they just want to get F1st scrapbox's slimmed down. I predict more of this type of "non event" in the future.
---
As someone who uses the gauss minigun, I assure you, it's not hard to not run out of ammo.
---
I agree. I have finished all content completely solo. Once I did that, now I play teams and grind end game. But 100%, if it wasn't for 1st allowing me to play my world and have a scrapping/cooking/stash/fast travel, I wouldnt' still be playing :)
---
I wish I had known this before I moved my camp. I had double sided walls and now I'm shit outta luck. Camp building was definitely my end game. Now I'm taking a break.
---
How much does a collectron cost on the atom shop
---
Well I did the event again, no issues. So the ash pile thing is shotty. I feel it has to do with explosive legacy weapons, mainly that tesla
---
Riveting tale, chap.
---
After they fix the bugs
---
fake numbers, auto complete, bethesda just giving us the stuff, moving the goal post, all of these were said. all of them have the same result.
---
one way or another, it was posited that bethesda would do something to to make use fulfill the event, and that was met with a barrage of people claiming that bethesda wouldnt do anything, and that the event was in risk of actually failing. those people where wrong, it was obvious then, its funny now.
---
Another one?
---
Seems like there is a lot of bitter people on this reddit. Any kind of positivty is down voted and they usually end up ruining your suggestion thread with constant bullshit as if everything should remain the same while bitching about how the game sucks but they still sunk 300 hours into it.
---
It doesn't require a lot of planning. You pretty much need blocker, nerd rage, dodgy, serendipity, fireproof, a decent set of unyielding armor and adrenal reaction. You can easy be all cannon and no glass.
---
Bethesda can‚Äôt math. Why are any of us surprised. Wouldn‚Äôt it, for example, be a good idea to measure how much concrete is stored on every inventory (a known number), and factor in the resource hourly spawn rate to calculate what your target for this event should have been? I mean - let‚Äôs be crazy and assume they did - we‚Äôre at less than 1% of the goddamned goal. And 4 million concrete shows some dedication when it‚Äôs minimum 250 per donation. I‚Äôve been playing for 6 months, got to level 150 and didn‚Äôt even have 250 accumulated over all that time of passive concrete gathering - never ever dropped it. Such terrible design.
---
Same, I only have one T-60 plan, and only know the first 3 ranks of the paint on one character. Would have liked an easier way to get them.
---
The deluxe includes the Uncle Sam outfit which you‚Äôll likely never wear, the vault boy mascot head, and tricentennial paint  schemes for the 10mm pistol, some power armors, and the hatchet.

I fondly remember finding whitesprings around 20ish. Freaking out at the stupidly fast swarm of ghouls I attracted. All part of the experience my dude. Wasteland should feel dangerous.
---
DO NOT SAVE UP TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS! It‚Äôs a dumb bug where the quest won‚Äôt start if you have old ones. You gotta get fresh ones every week. I had 250 and I couldn‚Äôt exchange them thanks to the bug. You can sell them to robot vendors since they have a value of 1 cap. Hope this was helpful to you.
---
I turned in 2.5k steel, and got grenades and alcohol. Idc what the end goal is, I am not participating in that crap anymore.
---
I regret Deluxe. Tricentennial paints are nice on some of the power armor, but you‚Äôll quickly find far superior ones either in game or atom shop. Not at all worth it.
---
Hi, I named my chickens BB Cue and D Stick. They have joined the Disco chicken fraternity.
---
My friend who has a junkies build has put a strobe in his chicken coop as his chickens are chem-dependent psycho chickens. ü§£
---
Lmfao nice
---
Dozens in 700 hours for me. Have been getting them forever.
---
See op for the joke
---
Definitely no way you‚Äôre gonna finish it. I missed 3 weeks and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm even gonna be able to finish it, if I‚Äôm not Ill just buy the last few ranks with atoms
---
Yes, they did, we only have 3 mil or so to go
---
we dont really know anything about them yet. I mean, we know that they are missions called expeditions, but thats it.
---
Just because you know the in's and outs of a bloodied build doesn't make it the norm.
---
You're very S.P.E.C.I.A.L. after all...
---
This man is either someone who does not know English very well or he is high as fuck
---
Themselves they have posted about her being immune to explosive and stagger effects in these very forums. 
---
They claim her not being able to be crippled will be fixed...
---
If only we can chose servers freely %)
---
Having the same issue here.
---
Seems like there is a laden trump support on bethesda's end... and a bald spot on the back of my head. Been looking for this item for months and am sorely disappointed
---
These Expeditions are just levels in literally any other game.
---
why would I support someone who can‚Äôt even form a complete sentence without calling me a shithead? Seems pretty obvious sry.
---
I can like something and not lump myself into a community that capitalizes on feeling hated.
---
That‚Äôs probably the approach I‚Äôm gonna take. I just hope I have enough money to afford the atoms.
---
I started selling mine for 2 caps because of demand.  1 cap per and I sold however many hundreds I had in my vendor about 30 seconds after posting them.  I‚Äôd rather sell fewer of them, but have some available for people who may really need them, than to sell them all to someone who will just turn around and resell them for 2 or 3 caps.
---
We have scorchbeasts despite having the scorchbeast Queen. Earl is just the Wendigo King.
---
Yea, but They wouldn't. They know that the only thing driving many aspects of this game is F.O.M.O. And if there was any way for a player to get locked out of a reward none of us (BGS included) would ever hear the end of it.
---
inb4 someone comes in an bitches that this has already been posted.
---
Let‚Äôs put a human real world example of the absurdity of this quest design.  
---
The United Nations demands that all of earth commit all their energy to finding 150 million tons of antimatter in a week, and your reward for this goal will be a Mexican street stand pinwheel and a day old churro.
---
I in fact formed several concise paragraphs without calling you anything.  You've been messing with me from jump and I'm out homes.  Get fucked.
---
Also it's not even real tall lol like at all
---
What in's and outs. Just do a Google search or read the perk card descriptions.
---
Now we have 121 posts about this \* slow clap \*
---
but earle is purple. that makes him special.
---
Good job man , ill have my 100% in 2 to 3 days.
---
No worries, no one has abundance in concrete apart from dupers, gravel pile CAMPS, or preppers
---
Devs, take notes.
---
New currency.  Pay me in concrete
---
They probably realized that on any given, fresh world map, there‚Äôs probably the equivalent of less than 10,000 concrete scrap pieces readily available, not counting scrapper perks, and realized then that there was no mathematical way that 150MM concrete was even remotely possible.
---
ok have fun! 
---
Future reference, if you‚Äôre trying to convince people to support something you believe in probably best to show some respect. Otherwise ppl won‚Äôt care what you have to say...
---
r/Fallout76FanGroups
---
Me and some friends are gonna coordinate nuke strikes to hit Atlas at the same time. 1, 2, 3!
---
After reading this comment it made me think. What is the likelihood of the present drops being the exact same as last years?
---
Normally i wouldnt say anything and just take some stuff, but Bethesda is well...Bethesda, i remember the blind bans they did at the start, thats why i got worried xd
---
that BSS sledgehammer is a pretty damn good 2H melee weapon actually. but, you'd have to run bloodied.
---
the FSS super sledge is meh. furious isnt that good on melee tbh
---
After failing to Discover Beckly or get SBQ credit on three characters, I sent in a screen shot of me standing in Beckly to Bethesda through the ticket system and was awarded atoms but the challenges still aren‚Äôt complete. I think I‚Äôll be stuck at 95% to platinum for eternity.
---
I have yet to find it.
---
Are you fucking serious?
---
The main reason people are "refusing" to donate IS BECAUSE GATHERING CONCRETE FUCKING SUCKS IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE.  No one fucking refused to turn in st eel did they?  That kind of kills your whole theory about how the entire community has turned on Bethesda and wants the event to fail because the rewards aren't good enough now doesn't it?
---
It has NOTHING to do with the rewards not being "rewarding" enough for people.  This whole "boycott Atlas because the rewards suck!" movement is essentially one part the halfwits still pissed off over their double sided walls trying to stir up shit and the other half being the entitled squeaky wheels that reddit amplifies who were looking forward to rare plans to hoard and sell for tens of thousands of caps or toss into the next dupe exploit that pops up.
---
The fucking crates ARE NOT THE REAL REWARDS.  Just like last fucking year with the scorched the ACTUAL REWARDS are the rewards from  the community goals.
---
And what do those community goals reward?  Brand new BoS shit?  Who would have fucking thought?
---
Jesus Fucking Christ why does ANY of this still need to be explained to people?
---
all my stuff is 100% legit, no duping... i'm just a grinder
---
Anecdotally, yes.  But it seems inconsistent.  I have played for 6+ hours on a Saturday and saw only swarm of Suitors, Mama Dolce, and prison break.
---
I have had much shorter sessions where I get the strangler heart, Brahmin herding, plus the above, and multiple Uranium Fever runs.
---
I am also rank 86, very close to 87. I have enough atoms that I could just buy my way to the end, but the frugal part of me says, ‚Äúwait and see what‚Äôs in the shop tomorrow, it might be something cool that you can‚Äôt live without.‚Äù And so I wait. Still might do it once I knock out all the new weeklies. We‚Äôll see.
---
Are you running any mutations? Because the Brotherhood would rather not have Hybrid monstrosities in their fold. More power to you if you can manage to properly RP Brotherhood of Steel, and play this game without mutations. That's going to be my next "1 life " build, I predict a short and sad outcome.
---
So I take it you're not going to bother with any of those worthless rewards then?  Not going to redeem any of the cosmetics or camp items from the atom shop?  Not going to take advantage of the score bonuses?  Or the purveyor sale?
---
He found out that some of the camp budget exploits were removed. now he cant use all that concrete
---
Amen they were duped so bad I had random players just giving me a bunch and then running away.
---
Damn bro, just admit you're wrong. You'll feel better lol
---
You apparently missed most of my post, that you can apply all of those perks to any build and be a tank. You don't need to google it. I tested it. "OP bloodied build"  is a subreddit myth. Bloodied isn't OP. Everyone just doesn't know how to use other builds. Yes low health gets more stat increases. But the bloodied damage aspect is bleh. I do the same damage with multiple builds. Bloodied is weak. Low health is OP.
---
Eh it's fine. They have plenty of time to evacuate the area before reengaging in the fight. You're only going to catch the slow ones.
---
Nuke the imposter!
---
I only just took the Carnivore mutation and ionized meat is amazing!
---
I know me some English hehe
---
Good Luck!
---
You were actually here after they bitched, sorry.
---
I'm wrong. And I feel better. Thank you.
---
first person when moving, third person when hiding.
---
it's the bush wookie way.
---
No one is saying you can't do that. You can't say that an overpowered tanky build is a glass cannon though.
---
Brotherhood will hopefully be taking a long walk is what you mean
---
most of the people who bash suggestions are people who defend this game to death, they cant even accept there could even conceivably be an issue with the game that needs to change.
---
although, people suggesting constant frivolous shit when bethesda cant even fix basic shit is getting tiring, and its always the same couple of posts, atom shop cirlejerks, "this community... blah blah" ect. there is alot of *fake* positivity mixed in with the real here.
---
Fixer
---
Server hop Slocum Joe‚Äôs but that‚Äôs rather mundane. Honestly just do the required dailies every day you can, it‚Äôs a long grind any way you slice it if not glitching.
---
I missed if by less than a minute. damn.
---
Exactly. And that is the real problem.
---
Are you in private or Adventure?  If in adventure, a message might pop up if someone else took your spot.  You might have missed it
---
Or how about we do something completely different and stop using the same mechanic again and again.
---
I think another issue with cork will be turning in 250 at a time.  I've been hoarding it since this was announced and don't have 200.
---
Aight, noted
---
levers are my bread and butter even my commando has one
---
It's already planned to have holiday scorched. It's on the roadmap.
---
I don't think Bethesda is even remotely that smart.
---
The more reasonable explanation to me is that management just pulled a figure out of their ass and went with that and the devs, either out of sheer ignorance or fear of reprisal if they spoke out, went along with that figure.
---
You literally can't. Nerd rage and serendipity kick in at 20 and 30% HP, respectively. Max unyielding bonuses are at 19% hp and you're never going to deal as much damage unless you're using a bloodied weapon.
---
single action- lever action 
---
semi - fixer
---
Put up brotherhood shit in my camp?   No.  Bos hats....No...Sale....there is one every month almost and it doesn't count for modules. Score bonuses.....level 87 I could NW challenge my way in at this point........Sorry I'm not a commie who gives up my shit to help the little guy!(IRL I am very active in my community and charities. .....please in these dark times its the little things that help out the most....volunteer even if its only one hour a month)
---
Wish you could mod it tho
---
handmade fixer and combat are all good.
---
lever action is best sniper.
---
Love the idea of the Bush wookies but I like the headless chicken sprint approach.
---
I‚Äôve grown so used to it that I don‚Äôt know how I would feel playing it with even decent performance and frames.
---
Nukacrypt.com
---
I think we're supposed to get up to 15 million posts about it to get the reward for this stage...
---
Don‚Äôt buy the atoms, it‚Äôs not worth it. Even if it‚Äôs only 50$, and it‚Äôll likely be more, is it really worth a few ingame cosmetics? You could get multiple games with hundreds of hours of content for that price
---
My bet too.
---
I find these "cut or fail" maneuvers embarrasing. 
---
Just me, I guess...
---
2 caps, take it or leave it.
---
Not excusing this event, but I think the amount of concrete is also an actual issue. It‚Äôs easy to get 20k steel accidentally by farming muties and scrapping, but concrete has to be found specifically.
---
PS4 here, I got 2,000 shells I could part with.
---
Well, They could have said "Sorry we hit that zero by accident, was always 15m of course" :-p
---
Hey now, can't we have a little fun at other people's expense? ;)
---
Look, you're not wrong but it's not good to gloat. 
---
You know you're right. That's all you should need. It just makes it look petty and immature when you brag about it and rub it into people's faces.
---
Take the W and be satisfied with that.
---
Mine is my main weapon and I even recently respecced a bit to be able to equip more shotgun specific perks because of it. It has the same problem with rubber banding out of VATs many other weapons of it type has but in VATS its a freaking monster for most normal high level enemies like Charred Ghouls, mole miners etc. It even sorts out Mirelurk Kings which used to be my nemesis and i can put most assaultrons on their arse in a few quick shots.
---
I love mine
---
"Too many items nearby" - that's the whole point of placing punctuation.
---
Awesome! Honestly glad too see another crazy ass camp!
---
What mods would you want on it? I dont find it lacking in any way
---
So edit your OP stating that your mind is changed because you didn't know what a glass cannon was.
---
Thats a new one
---
Hell, I've been in one if those situations myself. Faschnat parade, and some punter throws a nuke right on top of it, got the robot marchers sorted, then tried high tailing my fat ass out of the zone before it hits, fast travel out, and watch the nuke hit, laughing as I could see a few players get toasted, only to realise my camp was inside the blast zone. I still laughed, as all of it was avoidable but I was enjoying myself too much.
---
So, to the OP, carry on, enjoy yourself buddy
---
Adventure. That's what I thought at first, but I joined several different servers and no message appeared, but the camp still didn't show up.
---
Why the hell do I even want to help the Brotherhood in the first place? Those guys suck.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one with these specific glitches.  They don't bug me too much really... I just want the atoms....
---
Then by process of elimination you are high as fuck
---
i have the same thoughts! i figure i can do only the weeklies from here on out if i‚Äôm feeling particularly burned out. i‚Äôm going to try my best not to use any of my atoms! Might as well be patient enough not to try to finish the pass early üò¨
---
Happy you‚Äôre excited:) so am i!
---
I thought it was going to be like a Rust-lite, by the time I finally committed to buying it the PvP was turned off, sad, because It seems like it would add a lot more extra excitement to the game.
---
Brotherhood of steel , not brotherhood of concrete ..
---
Just wait for the free BoS one we will get
---
You are fixated on a non fact that all of the low health perk cards are designed for bloodied builds. They are there for multiple builds. You all seem fixated on the bloodied thing. I don't know why and I can't continue this conversation because I can prove that it is a  3 to 5 bullet difference for any situation in this game. Everything is easy to kill. This isn't dark souls.
---
Why did you post three times?
---
Looks like they lowered the goal down to 15 million.
---

Why do people downvote things like this? Your marking a valid point, even if I don‚Äôt agree with it personally.

Roflcopter. Two thumbs up here buddy!
---
Yup, my 500 is getting donated tonight now that there's a chance.
---
im aware. but that doesnt mean they cant change how to event mechanics work.
---
The first day of this I did a search through the internet there are 3 sources that I found where you can pick up concrete bags. The spots don't always spawn anything, and one spot can give supposedly up to 15 bags I never saw over 8 the other spots have 3-5. I tried really hard by server logging but the most I could come up with is 1000 so far, and I'm not playing the game just server switching to see if it's there then, grab it then move on. This event is impossible. The steel one was great easy to acquire, I believe that the consensus that they don't play, or even know anything about the game they are working on is correct.
---
I just spent 9 hours on my camp yesterday (including using the budget glitch) never saw that once. Peak frustration was that item needs support even though I had been running that BP over and over in the same spot connecting.   
---
How many items in the general area?
---
I was beginning a seafish. And you didn't read it.
---
Thanks, i love a good reddit sarcasm. I used google fyi but all that came up for me was an over a week old one.
---
Propably there to prevent stacking of walls to cause server crashes. Could be they put that in so they can allow the wall papers to work like they did earlier. But i guess people will complain anyway.
---
A miscommunication that *still exists* on the events page. It may say 15 million on the progress bar, but it still says 150 million on the events calendar directly below it.
---
Thanks! :)
---
I got a legendary shotgun with increased limb damage... Blow it's fucking legs off.
---
Works on everything honestly.

This is also happening to me. ;S

He stumbled on it because he was an idiot.
---
This isn't Republican vs Democrat etc, just pointing out that man was an idiot...
---
Had 2 wars under than man, and holy shit.  Pretty sure his advisors sent him reports on an etch-a-sketch...
---
I agree with your first half of your post. Second half of your post makes me think that you think all suggestions are frivolous when we only want the game to be better.
---
This is exactly the bitterness i was talking about. " people suggesting constant frivolous shit when bethesda cant even fix basic shit is getting tirin "
---
We can have both new stuff and fixes for the game, ps4 version makes the update happen less frequently due to costs updating with ps4 and is why we can't get any fast fixes since they want to release them at the same time for everyone. At least from what i understand.
---
There was a good thread recently that said they should decouple PC updates from console updates and it will allow them faster progress on PC version.
---
I keep seeing this idea pop up in different posts and can‚Äôt understand why. If Bethesda wanted to clear out dupers‚Äô stash boxes, they would have had donations for screws, lead, and ultracite. No dupers are sitting on a fat stack of cork and concrete. Those junk items have 0 value to anyone other than maybe a select few base builders.
---
I agree with you. I think the suits wanted big numbers to show how popular the game still is and I hope you are right about the developers just not speaking up. I‚Äòm starting to think the devs don‚Äôt even play the game. I mean we‚Äôve seen community managers play, but has anyone actually ever seen any of the developers in promotional content.
---
Well, my intention is to side with the BoS, get what I can off them, then go full Judas on them as fast as I can
---
Dont worry theyll add 4 new items each with a less than 1% chance to drop from large presents only. So its practically a brand new event AND all those items will still be in any old duped gifts lying around.
---
Lol fallot
---
I would like to see the game advance in that way, watching how the introduction of the gold creates new economies, things start to built up or change.  The static environments do start to get boring.....
---
I believe you, thats why the blind bans, they just banned everyone that got certian amount or type of stuff, not questions asked, but i want to believe they changed, so next time, ill just take some without fear. Its good to know people like you exist in a game with so rough start.
---
I've done it but it was to see if we could have multiple queens up at once, nothing like killing 20 players and having that queen die and the event fail for it to repop.  This was pretty early on though.   
---
It is damn funny though.

I swear there's a modification that connects the barrel and grip base for the laser, but I'm not sure as I barely use laser weaponry anymore. I was talking with other a while ago about the same thing, i'd definitely love to see the old models as skins for the modern versions, it'd be nostalgic just holding your weapon!
---
MATH!!!!
---
Yes, I'd be down for that so the dupers don't just open their presents and get anything new right away and make caps/trades based off any new stuff. 
---
That's IF we get anything new.
---
Doesn‚Äôt that rod still exist for laser rifles? If the one in my mind is the one you‚Äôre talking about, then I think it‚Äôs a frame for laser rifles ( not pistols tho )
---
My bet is they cut it to 2 mil.
---
I wish we had FO3 versions of plasma pistols, plasma rifles, gallons lasers, laser pistols, flamers, and maybe even the shishkebab
---
I had 1k and gave 500
---
Oh ok thanks I didn‚Äôt know that was a reward
---
I get it. It's all good... I'm just tryin to survive in the wasteland and spread a little hope &amp; joy.  Come Christmas, I'll put my Santa uniform on : )
---
I use bloodied firerate lever action, never disappoints, one shot one kill, 2 at max for scorchbeasts on full adrenaline

You shouldn't feel like scum.  That is called using tactics and having fun.

If you're getting a 50% off sale at the purveyor every month you should probably share your secret with the rest of us, considering we all just get 25% off.

---
Get the base game. Deluxe is just mediocre cosmetics.
---
If you get sucked into it consider getting fo1st that is a better use of your money
---
Yeah there is a support rod on the rifle barrels. Not pistol sadly. But when they changed the laser pistol in FO4, I went fucking ballistic. I missed my old school support rod of las pistol. Mainly cause I used it as a major side arm on my character. And even in New vegas i had one that had glow sights and recycler modifications. Which made that las pistol almost unlimited ammo, mainly because recycler mod would not use a shot after 3 shots, and 4th would be a freebie. Meaning you could get 7 extra shots per clip of 30
---
I have a bloodied shotgun build. Since I‚Äôm not stealthy, I‚Äôm going for the strangler heart power armor. With emergency protocols, any power armor should make you tanky.
---
I have about 10k shells I can pet with as well, if you want
---
Read the party poster in any train station and visit Biv in the tattoo parlor in Morgantown. And no, nuka grape is still in the game.
---
It depends on what I am looking for.   Most of my chars are junkies build, so chems.  Also plans.
---
Damn it.  You got me good there I tell you what. Cannt get nothing past this guy huh?  The purveyors rng is so terrible it could be a 100 percent sale and I'd still be full of rolling pins and walking canes.
---
Role-playing Free States follower (not a FO1-st subscriber). Had ca. 250 concrete. BOS asked for 250. No way I'm giving those steel dogs (a reference to dog tags) even a brick from the fortress of mine. But I'm all for fighting against them over the railway bridge near Delano Grange. Come and get it, tuna cans.
---
Bloodied is better. But consider looking for an unnarmed weapon. They hit much faster and do almost as much damage. In the end they do better DPS
---
is it just random if it gives to you when you log into a server or something?
---
I never really got any unarmed perks. All two handed.
---
Lol no. Dont worry
---
Lever gauss hunting
---
Suppressor
---
Correct.
---
I had a trade yesterday for a QE LA. Told the buyer I'll only trade for 10k concrete...
---
Farm Encryptid for plans.  I sell the Fixer from time to time in my vendor for 399. Probably the highest cost of a non \* I sell.
---
No, we may be raiders but we‚Äôre not savages. Wellll... the gourmonds are but their all gone now.
---
I must be one of the only people who likes the rewards. Didn't have time for previous "loot bag" events and this has gotten me two pieces of power armor plans. I've been after these darn things since beta and treasure maps have not been rewarding at all.
---
Just to back up your point (late comment, but just saw this after checking my own reply notification below).
---
I have this outfit. I bought '76 after Wastelanders. I got it because I tried '76 on PC Beth.net for a *free weekend*. The relevant character was still on my account after the change to Steam. Level 7 or so.
---
Hardly a 'Veteran' am I?
---
Not really worth it.   Just level what you can.  Maybe check the next few rewards where you are on sept. 6th and buy a level or two then if you see something you like.   Most of the rewards are meh,   I love the lunchboxes tho, lol
---
Yep.
---
its people coming here asking for everything from 50 different random atomshit items, to people asking for things like flyable vertibirds or something else in lala land when every update either fails to fix issues that have been in the game since launch or breaks something critical that wasnt broken in the previous update.
---
the game is in piss poor enough of a state that the effort needs to be on fixing things, not every bethesda plz request. big QOL features are one thing, but usually its just people asking for more camp items.
---
people coming in and constantly asking to be sold more are making it clear that bethesda doesnt have to fix shit when they can just put out a new wallpaper and all if forgiven.
---
He's a dirty synt... Oh wrong time.
---
Edit: added dirty.
---
Get one piece of armour that has 15% block damage. I don't know why but it absolutely fixes all rubberbanding on all overpowered weapons. It makes any decent shotgun a one shotter on most beasties.
---
I also scored a furious plasma gun that I modded into a flamer rifle. It simply melts everything. Close range and eats plasma like Limbaugh eats oxy, but it's a fucking wonderful toy. It also rubberbands unless sporting the blocking armor.
---
As an Enclave spec ops soldier, I REALLY hope we see a Fallout 3 style war between the two factions. If not, it would simply be nice to have some Enclave gear in the Atomic Shop.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Secret_Service_armor
---
This will give you all the current choices...
---
TS and E guns degrade weapons faster, that's why it has better durability.
---
No problem
---
To give him some credit, the place has changed since we donated steel. Still, the amounts he needs are obscene.
---
See, Bethesda needs to learn a thing or two from obsidian with new Vegas. Imagine if we could trade with mole miners when we found them and they were peaceful until we stole from them or attacked. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense that there‚Äôs only 2 friendly mole miners out of all of them in Appalachia.
---
Agreed, I definitely prefer the old school style of the laser pistol. Especially the reload animation, hate how Bethesda made the pistol and AR share the same ammo and reload animation in 4 because it took out the uniqueness of them
---
the old flamer models were the best, i do prefer the new plasma weapons though but i'd buy the old model skin in a heartbeat, the loyal enclave soldier that I am. the rod for laser pistols needs to return though.
---
You probably kept all the gold. I gave her half to stick with the deal and she‚Äôs friendly to me
---
I want the rod support to return mainly cause it brought so many good memories. Just looked so freaking cool
---
Oh.  Thought you were gonna be a foodie my bad.  In that case I completely agree it's a sad state of affairs.
---
15% blocking armor is the fix. Just one piece, any piece. I rolled scrip like a motherfucker to get a full set of Vanguard SS, but wouldn't stop until I had one piece of blocking. Worth it.
---
yeah seriously, that would be amazing!  even with every player vendor loaded with plans, I still rarely see anything I don‚Äôt already own, and I‚Äôm nowhere near as hardcore as most players in this game!
---
If a resource extractor generates 25 concrete an hour, we‚Äôd need 250,000 players picking up their concrete every hour for 24 hours out of this event to hit 150 million (or 6 million players collecting on the hour).  
---
That‚Äôs ridiculous, unreasonable, and entirely anti-fun. What the fuck, Bethesda? I get that Austin is the D-team, but come on. Let me love this game!
---
Does the poster give you a quest like sheepsquatch and order of the tadpole or do you have to go to the tattoo parlor to trigger the quest? Because I read all the posters a while ago and didn‚Äôt get any quest
---
I assume the only way to get nuka grape is by crafting it, right? I only final normal, cherry, and quantum in the world
---
Plasma flamers are awesome and super fun, prime that bad boy for major ammo savings!
---
Yeah i couldnt understand why steel reauired the least amount when it is by far the easiest respurce to gather, i had 25k steel in my stash box but only about rk of each other resource ddspite steel being the most used resourve too
---
I agree. I just... wish we could relive the nostalgia. In FO4 I hated the new laser pistols. Went right to rifles cause it was the only thing reminiscent of fo3.
---
why take just the W when i can have the salt too?
---
üßÇüßÇüßÇüßÇ
---
Skipping the whole stupid ass grind.  And if that means the BOS content will suck, because I didn‚Äôt grind my ass off, I‚Äôll skip that too.
---
Speed demon and marsupial are great, and make wasteland exploration amazing. Also running around with friends with perk card"strange in numbers" that increase mutation effects when with friends who are also mutated allowing you to bounce higher!
---
I never noticed that in the General's Steakhouse parking lot! I have found the flamingo v gnome war in their gardens though. I also found a teddy bear strip club in an outhouse...
---
this is why with games like this, ESO, and FFXIV, I mostly really play when new story quests gets released üòÜ
---
Bethesda addressed them at QuakeCon. They didn‚Äôt technically say the name expeditions but they‚Äôve already announced Expeditions and that seems like the closest thing
---
Melee is all about killing whatever you are attacking before it can kill you. Perks like serendipity and blocker only work so many times before something gets lucky, the perk doesn‚Äôt proc, and you‚Äôre dead.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you mean when you say ‚Äújuggernaut.‚Äù If you mean you are in PA(Power Armor) then I would highly recommend sticking with bloodied, junkies, or instigating. These allow you to hit your peak damage on the first swing rather than having to soften up your target like with furious.
---
If your not in PA your options are a lot more open since you can use an unyielding set to make up for some of the lost damage from the primary legendary effect. Even running around with half health can give your damage a substantial boost. Combine a full unyielding set with bloodied or junkies weapons sitting at 20% HP is the best it gets.
---
Its all about how close to that 20% you want to get. My pipboy says I hit for 1200 with my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet and powerfist. When you use sneak alongside those kinds of numbers I will one shot anything except queens and high level squatches. It‚Äôs all personal preference.
---
Good thing i never made any suggestions that involve atom shop items lol. You also gotta understand that people want more items to decorate their camps with since the building of camps is one of the reasons people play this game for a long time. Not much else to do overall lol.
---
I've been thinking about it. What's it take? I have a primed gause shotgun and a non primed for when I run out of amo and crimson.
---
I've vowed not to prime a gun until I have a non-primed copy. 
---
And furious plasma guns are hard to come by....people scrip them because they just don't know about the flamer mod?
---
I believe in the quake con interview they said expeditions could be the ‚Äúnew areas‚Äù we go to like the capital wasteland, Pittsburgh and even new areas.

These are my two melee builds if you would like to check em.

I‚Äôd honestly rather be given fucking canned dog food than those stupid floater grenades.
---
Ha
---
If you're on PS4 I can give you the plan for free
---
They really do have to add new stuff to them. Even if they‚Äôre not plans, add like holiday themed armor and weapon skins or camp items
---
They should let you pay to roll specific perks.
---
5 legendary modules to roll a specific perk and keep the others would be nice. Yeah it would mean god rolls weapons are less rare but they should be far more obtainable than they are now anyway.
---
Hell yes! Now we can see Fallout 3 in much better graphics! Maybe we can even go to New England like Far Harbor!
---
I'd have stashed and sold that shit. All of it.
---
Right, it‚Äôll give you a riddle that will direct you to the parlor. Head to the backdoor of the shop. Talk to Biv and he‚Äôll give you the quest to get the recipe for nukashine. Upon completing that you‚Äôll get the brewing stations.
---
If you‚Äôve already read the poster by chance then just head to the parlor. Otherwise you may have a quest in your miscellaneous side quest tab ‚Äúread the poster‚Äù. Make it active near a train station. 
---
Nuka grape can be obtained two ways:
---
1: go to the frat house on fraternity row (there‚Äôs two; one with a red door and one with a blue door; can‚Äôt remember which one it is) and go inside and you‚Äôll find a nuka cola fanboy bedroom (you‚Äôll know it when you see it) and there‚Äôs all the different flavors of nuka on a shelf. 
---
2: go the second floor of Whitespring resort. From the main entrance head to the right. Pass the bar and you‚Äôll find a room further back on the left which is a nuka cola restaurant where you can purchase all the different flavors. 
---
Those are the only two ways I know of for getting grape other buying it from people‚Äôs vending machines.
---
I sacrifice Gnomes to the concrete deity. As a player that likes to build CAMPs I often will plop a camp down on a concrete resource or take over a workshop with concrete. I find this easier than random concrete looting. I still pick up all concrete when I come across it though.
---
I think this whole thing was really just to get people to clear out excessive amount of scrap for various reasons.
---
I'd be surprised if they don't somehow make the missed cosmetic rewards available at the end of all of it. Either toss them in the BOS vendor for bullion or put them in the atom shop or make them an event reward for a later event.
---
Simple solution is the holiday scorched drop 3 tiers of tokens. You redeem the tokens at a vending machine which is the equivalent of opening a present and poof stuff in your inventory. Tokens have no weight, can't be dropped or placed in stash...
---
You're my people OP. Take an upvote across the board.
---
The holo side was so unappreciated I feel. I've got a collection of my faves stashed.
---
You don't want double SCORE or extra SCORE weekend?
---
3 characters and it won't trigger for me either.
---
 not* go to waste

If they‚Äôre not I am üôèüèº
---
This is a new one I haven't run into yet. Building nerfs in this game are not welcome changes. Fix the bugs, but leave the building mechanics alone.
---
Thanks for all the cork, but we're gonna habe to confiscate that laser rifle of yours...
---
I am on ps4

He‚Äôs got a tough ground sweeping swing with his water cooled bone saw.

There was a bug today (has since been addressed by Bethesda) that allowed players to return to Smiley in the wayward a bunch of times to buy gold bullion for caps. I assume all these items came from duped Christmas presents those players opened for caps. With that said, I don't think you should be worried. There's been millions of those presents floating around now for quite a while.
---
They aren't but since they are always active at low health and they stack so well what adrenal reaction and unyielding armor, they contribute to making blooded OP. Now if they were active once every 5 mins or a something like the that, they would be balanced. Your original premise is that blooded is a hard for figure out glass cannon and is not OP. Almost everyone here tore you a new one on your premise. Have a good one.
---
I have and haven't spawned the plans yet..
---
You and me both. I always wondered why people complained about not having cork, then I figured out its because I still scrap pipe weapons all the time. Looks like we will be two of the biggest contributors to cork. :P

Bethesda are a bunch of fucking clowns. 0 respect.
---
Well, that's easy. This is Fallout and in Fallout the BoS are the coolest guys ever and we should all worship them. Or that's how it's been since Fo3 it seems.
---
There may be items that give plastic which you don't know of. I seem to have lots of it. However, I do not use shotgun. so maybe it is a matter of supply with little demand. You might want to consider occasionally taking over the munitions factory for ammo.
---
It uses cobalt, you get over two hundred rounds per craft :)
---
Ebay seller confirmed. We're all banned now for helping him do RMT.
---
How about don‚Äôt learn any of the dogs shit plans like guitar swords and death tambourines??! The less you know the higher your chances at the hot shit for drops.
---
I mean, we all know it wasn't REALLY a miscommunication, but it's the least unbelievable thing they could say to save face.  It's ever so slightly possible someone tacked a zero on accidentally somewhere along the way.  That's not what happened, but it COULD have happened.
---
From the GIF on the webpage ( [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events) ) it looks like hes adding a couple of cement bag walls and some barriers .. hes not even moving/braking down the broken vehicles just building around them.
---
OP you're an artist.
---
Such a subtle, yet strong message.
---
It also translates to bullion.... Scrip.....
---
Upvoting everything I see here.
---
The Level 30 Fixer is from a quest.  The plans come from the Encryptid event.  I commonly find non-legendary ones; they aren‚Äôt worth much.  The plan is as it allows you to get legendary fixers from the purveyor (once learned)
---
I drop at the one near whitesprings or foundation and leave it so if another player finds it, then they will become wanted if they pick it.
---
Can you at least tell us what you were trying to do when you got this message instead of continually deleting and reposting this with more and more hyperbolic titles?
---
I am running a junky build based off my bloodied build. At 50% health he is just as viable as my bloodied build. I can't win this argument. But it is finishable.
---
My man.
---
Okay well my internet decided have an outage so whenever I get back online I'll let you know
---
So I bought one for 5k caps a month ago next event got one. Then tonight I just did the event a minute ago and another dropped. I plan on trading them or just giving them away to someone on Xbox. It truly is an amazing gun and everyone should get one
---
How about you read the post? And calm down, I reposted it once. Only because bethesda brown nosers like you keep downvoting it.
---
 Edit: also who refreshes new on a fallout sub just to talk crap to people who are reporting changes.
---
Yes and instead of water its a radioactive poison mist like the strangler heart.
---
If they gave us 135,000,000 for free we would be at 147,000,000. I know what you mean but they just lowered the requirements, probably doing the same with the cork.
---
I went to some dudes camp and he had 4 different staircases to go up to get to his machines scattered about the place. As soon as I  opened his last vendor, I  started taking damage, by time I backed out I was dead. 
---
They were using chameleon to hide and spawned their blueprint of punji board stacks on a mat behind me. So now if they aren't in one spot, I'll take my caps and go.
---
Oh tip for you new guys, try to stash your junk before going camp shopping, some trap camps are very well concealed or in the case I just explained unavoidable.
---
Just in case you aren't aware, Cigarettes and Cig. cartons both contain Plastic. 
---
Cafeteria trays are also plastic and you can usually find them in stacks of 5 or more. Aside from the common suggestions like schools and west tec, there are quite a few with Rose at the Top of the World that are always there/overlooked. I stop in there regularly to stock up on frag grenades and plastic. Don't miss the pumpkin by the podium!
---
Damn, I wish I could donate even less than nothing. I was really looking forward to this failing.
---
It's so unbelievably dumb to "donate" farmed mats and make believe they will build something out of it.
---
They could have had us search and loot quest item versions of mats for the event.
---
imagine not being able to kill a bat lmao.
---
Greatly appreciated
---
Any new activity is well accepted,soecially if it involves tough challenges with friends.
---
Gotta give credit where it's due
---
&gt;Skin for pipe pistol
---
You joke, but I've got a kick ass BEFR pipe pistol that I'd love to skin so I don't accidentally scrip it.
---
ViciousC30 :)
---
I always spawn into one spot when I fast travel to my CAMP, that may just be me.
---
Even my cat can kill a bat.....
---
wow, good move there Beth. i just wonder if its alittle to late since alot are upset &amp; have just bailed on it already.
---
Rlly
---
The only dick thing about this is that occasionally when nuking the queen a second time when the even is still taking place will bug the event and cause her to not drop any loot anytime she‚Äôs killed after that one event. So for the duration of that particular server it‚Äôs kind of a bummer.
---
Yep, I absolutely get the economy of it. But no matter what, I know where to easily farm the components for  non-primed ammo. Hell, I don't even really 'farm'.  I just grab that shit when I'm near by. I've never once run out of ammo or the components to make ungodly amounts of the ammo I need from what's in my stash.
---
But the day I ran out of prime EC....and know what a pain in the ass it was going to be to get more without my gause shotty? That's when I unprimed it and rolled for another that I could prime. 
---
Also, crimson is fairly easy to come by, it's everywhere when someone nukes for the queen. So, I know, i know...I'm bitching about the easiest flux to come by. 
---
Cobalt? Jesus, that'll pretty hard to find unless you yourself nuke for it specifically.
---
I'm definitely holding off until I come across another Furious Plasma.
---
I don‚Äôt care much for the banner, but I would be happy if this change only applied for cork, that extra score would be nice
---
You on PC? I have a ton of plastic I‚Äôve been hoarding to make shells but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ever gonna run out so it‚Äôs yours if ya want it.
---
Currently selling croc backpacks, only 250k concrete each....
---
83 'ticks' per hour and depending on the ammo type, some only give 1 round per tick while others give 5 rounds per tick.
---
I get right at 400 5.56 an hour.
---
You're right. Bethesda is just completely incompetent. This person just wants to suck Bethesda's dick like a good little customer and "stick it" to the people who thought Bethesda would fuck up the event (which they did and the goalpost being moved is proof that they have no idea what they're doing and were just fuckin wingin' it the whole time). He's going to dance around the words and say stupid ass shit like this:
---
&gt;Someone clueless twit at Bethesda genuinely believed there was enough concrete out there for people to turn in that many and seeing how fucking wrong that idea was they reassessed things and lowered the goal.
---
to try and spin it in his favor, when we all know that we would have failed the original 150m goal and that lowering it is proof that Bethesda is admitting defeat.
---
I‚Äôm windering about your non-attendance.....üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Bethesda if you're reading this, just change the 200 million Cork to 20 million already. If we can't get ANYWHERE close to 150 million Concrete, even though concrete is easier to find than cork, there's no damn way we can do 200 million Cork.
---
This didn't age well
---
Even 20 million would be stretching it.
---
This is the best answer. Shotguns are Vats only.
---
Elder maxson is a simp synth
---
I have a troubleshooters fixer for sale, 5K or less, can't remember.
---
It‚Äôs the third prefix. So only appears on three star armors if rng selects that
---
Hmm. Okay, I was just curious because there's plenty of builders on YouTube that are pretty quick to find things like this and since it's been a good amount of time since the last patch I'd assume we'd have heard about it. You say you were placing letters, but how many, and why does the picture of your screen not show you trying to actually place anything? Not trying to say you're lying are any bullshit like that, just want a bit of clarification... Maybe a bit of testing before you declare a "stealth nerf". The game acts weird on a good day, and I personally think you should give us something more than a picture of your TV.
---
Edit: And yeah, I hang out in the new queue. Not that I actually owe you an explanation, but I do it to help out newer players that have questions who's threads won't get visibility on the Front Page
---
Windering the non-attendance??
---
*The illiteracy is strong in this thread.*
---
Non attendance stealth builds are like Fasnacht. Look in second story bedrooms. Attics. Etc.
---
i saw, and its makes sense. but thats all we actually know, everything else beyond knowing that its something they want to do is just speculation at this point.
---
it would be wise not to overhype something before we actually know what it is. people start filling in the blanks then get really pissed when it doesnt meet up to expectations.
---
How does blocking work. I have a piece but use commando B25 weapons- can magic still trigger somehow?
---
Proof that Bethesda has no idea what they're doing and are just fuckin' winging it.
---
Yes screw those guys. It‚Äôs not Tagerdy‚Äôs BOS anyway.
---
Trying this tomorrow
---
bethesda didn't make eso!
---
What I do is scrip only the ones that use module pieces and sell every other legendary that‚Äôs crap for low prices at my vendor. I also scrip any heavy items that aren‚Äôt selling even at the suggested value.
---
I love me some confetti mess. Love it.
---
You do what you have to do, as much as people complain about it. It is a legitimate play style.
---
Secret Service armor can't be vendored or scrapped, you can only scrip or drop it.
---
I have no idea how it works. It just does. And in my experience, it negates all rubberbanding on all overpowered (magic?) weapons.
---
If I'm wrong, someone let me know. I don't want to spread bullshit on Reddit.
---
EDIT; You don't have to actively block or anything, just having it equipped does the trick.
---
Ive seen you guys bitching about this for days now...
---
The needed amount on the link provided is 15m... 
---
Not 150m...
---
I hope you guys haven't been misreading this...
---
122th post about this
---
They used to have this (and still do for workshops, I believe). People abused it and put the fast travel mats right in the midst of traps.
---
This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things.
---
FWIW, I would like to see to see them change CAMP traps so that they only effect hostile mobs and players who are already in PvP with the player. Even without the mats, there are people who use the placement of vending machines to lure people into traps, just to be griefers.
---
sorry if there‚Äôs others I haven‚Äôt seen anything about this
---
Imagine failing it and getting a broadcast across Appalachia that they weren't coming b/c their 'home' wasn't ready. üòÜ Bunch of sissies.
---
That actually makes sense percent wise. It‚Äôs super rare to have a three star with the first and last prefix show up as the one you want and multiply that by five versus just getting one unyielding which should be 1/16. What you want is the chance of a three star armor times the number of one prefixes then times that by the number third prefixes. I wanted that set until I did the math and it looked like it would be five years of playing to get that set.
---
Will prob be a atom item to convert bloody mess. Lol
---
I have seen some dialogue options go crazy when in a team. Maybe, there is bug which causes NPC's to show the dialogue and reactions to the team leader or something.
---
I haven't donated a single scrap.
---
There is even one marked as "hot".
---
It wasn‚Äôt on PS4 with two lvl 300+ helping take down the scorch beast was it? Dude cooking was in his underwear?
---
I did Watoga a few hours ago. 121 plastic from just the cafeteria area
---
I agree. They could have made concrete a common drop item for the time period or something or given us something to do to get more.
---
I meant I scrip the ss stuff I craft and then sell every other enemy and event  dropped legendary in my vendor
---
we play between 2-4 people.
---
if you want to join add me ign radenn
---
I... would probably buy it
---
I always play 3rd person for higher fov and crosshair, I only switch 1st person when looting a bag on an uneven terrain or indoors.
---
this should be THE REAL end score reward !
---
Considering they seem to be made out of paper mache, it'll probably be every hour.
---
If they do something like this in the future they should use more common junk so we don‚Äôt have this issue
---
Your accounts don‚Äôt link so you would need a new character as far as I‚Äôm aware. You may be able to speak with support at Bethesda about transferring membership though. Doesn‚Äôt seem likely but worth trying unless someone else here has already tried it!
---
Characters are not transferable between platforms, so no. You need to get the subscription on a per platform basis
---
u can do a similar route for whitespring. i cant provide u with the exact number of mobs bcz i am to lazy to search but u can do it for urself. Morgantown isnt even close to that number. As for my experience i got 25 kits to create stabilized flux from Morgantown and 40 from Whitespring. It is an average number based on hundreds of runs with same conditions. Of course i dont force u to believe me and change ur farming process but as for science u r wrong and could try whitespring if u even care :)
---
there is another magic location in Harpers Ferry where scorhed spawn like crazy but i dont have so much experience there so I ll go with Whitespring for the best option.
---
Microsoft account, I did this three days ago and also received a refund, I had it less than a month.
---
The entire page isn't updated. Everything still lists triple million digits.
---
I love my insta kill shotgun but wish I could put a suppressor on it for my shotgun ninja build.
---
Are you moving your CAMP object during the build? Spawn points are supposedly set by the location of the CAMP item, if you move it during your build then your spawn points will change, but you can play around with its placement until it gives you the best possible spawns if you want.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea cuz then the duper‚Äôs won‚Äôt be able to dupe them
---
Better than being completely ignorant
---
If bethesda were to just put everything you can already get in game it would be more of an incentive to donate but they don't seem to care or listen to the community oh well.
---
What is this holo called and where do you get it?
---
shhhh they want to crush our dreams
---
Now that right there is something to think about, it might be the exact reason behind this narrative. I don‚Äôt know that duped junk has effected the in game economy as badly as duped handmades but it makes me wonder. 
---
Similar to gun buyback programs at inner city police stations.
---
It's weird.. Spawn points seem to migrate over time. We all know you'll spawn relative to the camp module, but seemingly even minor changes to your camp alters it slightly. Or sometimes it just decides to alter on its own. Either way I think we can all see the benefit to a static spawn point, but it's also something that can be extremely exploitable,  so in the end we have a compromise. We can at least make a general spawn area rather than a specific target.
---
Maybe the vendor can be a Santa collectron next to a Christmas tree surrounded by Christmas presents as decorations
---
We didn‚Äôt fail. We hit the 15 million
---
I highly assume these expeditions will be vaultraids. 
---
Its confirmed that the closed one will be return and one new will be added, also the roadmap shows we're getting two expeditions.
---
It will totally fit into Bethesdas lazy and low effort behaviour.
---
after checking I found 2, sorry I didn‚Äôt look through everything
---
People have been saying from DAY ONE that Bethesda would cheat and fudge the numbers to complete the challenge regardless of how much people actually turned in. 
---
Those people were right. Bethesda developers don't play their own damn game.
---
Oh well lol. Guy wasn‚Äôt floating but it was funny that you posted it right when he was doing it at the tent.
---
A good location that it usually spawns is on the top of a stone arch at the south part of savage divide at the bottom of the map
---
Sure? I heard there is at least one left inside a cave in savage divide...
---
Me too....
---
Near the top corner of the map, I usually find some there, I think there‚Äôs a lead deposit near by and a broken down camp
---
All I'm really hoping for is a different way to earn reputation... I still haven't gotten the Settler's anywhere close to max after siding with them.
---
The Campfire tales event, you will be drowning in them
---
Not bad, that'll bring people together to share in the holiday spirit.
---
It is not out yet . It will be an event reward when the collosulle problem event is activated . Hope this helps
---
There's also cran, dark, orange, wild and the one with the vaccine.
---
The loot pool includes all the base game items as long as you're above the minimum level. The only things you need to learn the plans for are the things that have been added since then, like the fixer, bear arm, squatch weapons, and the new bullion stuff.
---
In Bandit roundup ( the game with the moving targets), just use an gun with an explosive effect. It gets you max tickets everytime.
---
Sort my profile by top of all time and you can see my credentials when it comes to building, im yelling stealth nerf, because its a stealth nerf.
---
It‚Äôs a power armor bug, been around forever
---
Plastic bag, take it or leave it.
---
Canvas is only for influences, but they get it for free.
---
Literally the first thing they ask for is steel, WTH you are named Brotherhood of Steel. Pathetic!
---
It's all just data anyway. They can flub it and make it look like it was done or a 'glitch' and "Oh, well can't fix everything."
---
That's an old visual glitch caused by wearing PA. Rare but still sometimes happens.
---
Why? They're just going to autocomplete the rest of the challenges for us. It's all a joke. There's literally no point in donating to this moronic event.
---
Still can help them pin point people, lots of people on the server hard to check everybody with the team they got
---
It has? That's interesting.
---
üôÑ
---
I'm 82 and I haven't done everything to get Score especially the NW stuff.
---
The shack right under v76 and the lumber yard there too
---
Tell that to my nuclear arsenal
---
Same. I didn't even know it got released until last week and felt immediately crushed that I'd missed it.
---
I think my connection was messed up so it triple posted. My bad!
---
The plans?
---
Wait ain‚Äôt it already out I swear my friends and a streamer and youtuber has it
---
So just make the event exclusive items character bound like bullion or atomic shop items are. Boom, solved.
---
&gt;Well, at least we'll know for sure that Bethesda isn't fudging the numbers
---
Aaaaand they just fudged the numbers.
---
No it's on the pts servers on pc but not released yet
---
Southampton Estate, which is just south of Abbys Bunker in the top left of the mire has a few. There is also a few on top of Gorge Bridge.
---
And campfire tales event has plenty.
---
the sea between treetops and dabny homestead might be worth a look.
---
I liked treasure hunter event but I'm a first year player so it seemed novel to me and the preamble to fasnacht. I don't even know what this current thing is. I haven't gotten anything from the rewards even close to treasure hunters, no plans, nada. Just alcohol and other junk.
---
Amen.
---
Did they disable it or something
---
Brotherhood of Steal
---
??? Huh
---
It‚Äôs still something to do besides boring quests and events. How about you stop raining on my parade and me trying to be happy?
---
In my camp, I have a small garage with vending machines and I went as far as to organize and label what's inside them
---
Doesn‚Äôt work for me
---
I got the Standard Backpack a few days ago. I did buy the Chemist mod from the Raider Mr. Handy so I could unequip Traveling Pharmacy and equip other perks.    
---
The backpack is leveled so If you're not 50 you can't make the max one.
---
This means that Bethesda won't let challenges fail, which means we can all just sit back and keep our resources for ourselves because Bethesda will just autocomplete the challenges for us.
---
Suits me just fine. This was a stupid idea for an event anyway.
---
The rug
---
Or test servers
---
Yeah, I did that for a little while. That said, it was so boring. I‚Äôll eventually get back to it but it‚Äôs rough. Haha
---
Thanks man, good luck. :)
---
What about the mine where you nuke it and it opens i know my friend and streamer got it there
---
It's only on test server rn socits not released
---
I'm on Xbox. Have rolled a single unyielding after 60 rolls. This will take me forever.
---
Ah ok
---
When will it come
---
~~thats the legendary who will come with the new quest.  
---
it can spawn at a very low chance in any nuke zone. i found only one so far in the sundew grove (which got stuck somehow and barely moved so it was a easy kill :D)~~  
---
edit: bs... i overread the word rug, sorry. the statement above is correct :)
---
Well, the game is out for almost two years now, everyone should be at lvl200 after 3-4 months with ease.
---
At the quakecon where all community manager played the colossal problem no one was on such a level. Im fact their characters were from level 59 to 170.
---
Funfact: the lvl 59 char had a full set of legacy thorn armor, which were only available in the vault raid - it would take minimum 14 runs to get these plans and enough vaultsteel to craft at least one set. The issue now is his level, since the raid were only accessible at lvl 50,  should gained way more levels then he had. Guess the community managers are cheating...
---
Can confirm
---
It's the meat/goo/ash piles.  Bethesda tried to fix something (I suspect a multiple drop exploit I had heard of) and made the piles break graphics performance.  They need to fix this.  This patch will be known forever to me as the patch that broke more than it fixed.
---
&gt; *"You got the gold! I knew you could!"*
---
Why I finished the run, most I know have as well or will finish on tome without the help.
---
I'd rather a more direct reward like the provisions but instead of a watered down Christmas gift that mostly gives alcohol and grenades I'll drop or sell to a vendor give us some unique plans or rewards related to BOS (I'm okay if its non tradeable)
---
Give us a slim chance at a little gold bullion and script as well maybe.
---
Most players know most if not all of the plans in the loot table now and most suck anyway.
---
Edit: also saw they dropped concrete goal from 150m to 15m and the tracker jumped up over 12mil from 4.65mil. I have my doubts they are tracking it for real anyway considering its not a live tracker and even if they are I'm really doubting they will let us fail any of them.
---
I'll keep my junk.
---
Why? Have you not learned your lesson yet? Every update to the game lately has been one embarrassment after another. Given Bethesda's track record of late, what on Earth makes you think this feature won't be a complete letdown and a horribly bugged and unplayable mess? How do you look at what the failbois at Bethesda are doing and say, "Yeah, this is gonna be terrific"?
---
The railway is by far the most fun.. üôÇ
---
The plans what?
---
Laughed at this, and what we gonna do? Post another angry thread and they just ignore it? Nothing rly changed since patch 21 and people was angry on this sub
---
Simp
---
It's too bad 99% of the machines are stuffed with duped mounted head plans and redundant, overpriced ultracite limbs.
---
Glad they lowered the total goal, I checked my scrap box and only had 2k concrete and I have been buying it from vendors every time I see it aswell as farming it from the monorail elevator and site charlie etc. I won't be donating to either of the next Alpha goals though, as they only offer extra SCORE/Challenge weekends, which are totally useless for anyone who has already fiunished the legendary run.
---
BROTHERHOOD SUCKS 
---
JOIN DUTY TODAY
---
So, there's a pretty big difference here from Project Clean Appalachia. PCA asked the community to kill scorched and scorchbeasts, which we already do en masse. This new event is asking people to part with their scrap, so instead of it being stuff we already do, we've got to not only donate our hard earned resources but have to specifically farm for a lot of them which is something we normally wouldn't. Of course people want better individual rewards for their contribution because they're paying in scrap to participate, and breaking their own play cycles and routines to do so.
---
Third person widens your field of view which is a real advantage in seeing your enemies first .. and that is really important.
---
They should keep effects like that as results of using mutation serums. :D
---
This looks awesome what platform are you on and gt
---
!remindme 3 months
---
I kind of hope they make lunchboxes a reward for boss level events in the future. Scorched Earth, Encryptid, and eventually Colossal Problem gains a chance of dropping one or two per event.
---
I thought that was already established lmao
---
everyone does it at some point, it's always amusing watching everyone scramble out of the zone when you do it. it's also a laugh when you're in the middle of something chaotic and there's an nuke inbound so you play the " HOLY FUCK CAN I KILL THIS SHIT BEFORE I GET VAPORISED" game and end up running like fuck at the last minute.
---
I've rebuilt and moved my camp around a few times the last couple of weeks and, no joke, EVERY SINGLE TIME the spawn point is at the back of my new building, on the opposite side from where I put my vending machines. So annoying. I wish we still had the welcome mat spawn point for our camps.
---
I was more or less just talking about the event, but yeah lol it kinda is already established isn‚Äôt it...
---
Tyr has a great vid on NW setup.. you should check it out .. see you in Valhalla üôÇ
---
When the event started I expected a quest marker for the observatory to pop up or something. Nope, had to Google where it is because I honestly can't remember the last time I went there.
---
Don‚Äôt think you can. Have to play it via Steam.
---
Yesterday I watched that happen on a PC server - nuked the queen and people were already in the area. I was just outside so I stood on the edge to watch it go boom. With like 10 seconds to go I see a dude in power armor haulin'ass out of the blast zone. I was like wow, that was cutting it close, dude... As the nuke went off. I thought he was safe for about 2 seconds but then he burst into flame and collapsed. I tried to run and revive him, but he was dead dead.
---
I think its legit to nuke any spot on the map. Maybe Flatwoods wouldn't be cool to any newbies who may be hanging around, clueless, but they gotta learn sometime, right?
---
I'd give it a go instead of sitting on my scrap.
---
Yeah I just got back into the game, I bought it on release, played it for a few months, and I never touched it again, until I got bored and decided to play it when it came to steam, and holy fuck, every single thing just makes me say, "why?"
---
I like that theory a lot actually the one where agent grey faked his own death
---
BOS lore breakdown:
---
- BOS actually forms in 2081
---
This works for anything camp related
---
Why would you want to play on Beth? It's an inferior launcher to Steam.
---
I'm betting they'll be exactly the same. They'll just flip the switch for the exact same event, and likely the same Santatron bug for the first few hours at least.
---
850 hours and still a scrub
---
Which roadmap are you referencing? the one on bethesda.net that has the colossal event update and shows Bos coming, etc or was there another one released? I have not heard about these expeditions at all.
---
Lol, at least I know I have plenty of company with these same glitches.
---
Fallout 3 is still like 175 or so years in the future from where we're at, so don't expect it to be the Capital Wasteland we're used to.
---
Yes, I agree with you. However, this was different. They set a bar that was practically impossible to achieve with the concrete portion. I mean, so many people said they weren‚Äôt going to participate in this at all yet the first part was waaay over the goal. So obviously people are trying their best somewhere. If they didn‚Äôt lower the bar for concrete, they would have set up their own system for blatant failure and the little community they have left (which is still large) would be as bitter as the rest of us. My comment of burning to the ground was just a phrase I chose to use to express the freak out that would have happened. Most of the time the complaints do not get answered by them, I get that. When the building community lost their shit due to the double wall ‚Äúfix‚Äù they actually responded saying they didn‚Äôt realize the fix for a dupe would have such a negative effect on something so positive. They admitted they didn‚Äôt even consider that aspect of it and promised to add double walls. So they do hear us when we are loud enough. I feel that this falls into the same category as the walls. It‚Äôs a negative thing that would have impacted an innocent community project just like the negative duper fix hurt the innocent builders. Just my view
---
When the cost of something is dropped do you consider the difference of original cost a ‚Äúsaving‚Äù or do you say ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt on sale and I didn‚Äôt save any money, they just lowered the price.‚Äù?
---
Mutant leather imo. AP refresh is sexual to have.
---
Lmao I think I was on that server, saw a nuke launch a minute after the first one, then another one like 10 mins later, all in the exact same spot.
---
You can't handle criticism? Wrong place, welcome to the Internet, especially on a board where people are discussing. Don't get me wrong, I also ove fallout - but I can't ignore all the bullshit Bethesda is throwing at us and keep wearing my 10 pink glasses to perfectly ignore what's going on. 
---
Its necessary to write critics so the problems get unravel, otherwise absolutely nothing will happen. We all want bugfixes, new content and no lazy fuckups.
---
No problem!
---
 There is an alternative for early on as someone had mentioned which would be a full set of "Excavator Power Armor". The lowest level you can use it though is 25 I believe. Here is the quest: "[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Miner\_Miracles](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Miner_Miracles)". When you get to that point, black titanium tends to be a little tough to get sometimes so farming mole miners at "Blackwater Mine"(which is right next to whitesprings station) can be a good source
---
As for other recommendations on weight though, 
---
1.  You should scrap most all gear that you don't use as you'll level pretty quickly and it isn't too difficult to come across it later.
---
2. Scrap all your junk, just about everything will weigh less.
---
3. Bulk your aluminum and lead as they are the only 2 materials that reduce in weight when doing so.
---
4. Don't hold onto much steel as it is probably the easiest material to come by.
---
5. Don't bother holding onto very much of any ceramic, concrete, or cork(sometimes glass too) as they are rarely used(aside from this event of course).
---
6. Keep minimal amounts of gunpowder as it can add fast. On top of that, since it is a "misc" item, there is no way to reduce its weight. Personally, the only time I ever have more than 20-30 gunpowder is if I'm making it for ammo then and there.
---
...and I think that's all I got there lol
---
If anything, Bethesda people are masters at crafting worlds full of hidden little stories. One of the reasons I don't fast travel all the time because discovering these is simply rewarding.
---
Even that's not true. 
---
I've had the same camp setup for a while and sometimes I'll spawn in a different spot for no apparent reason. Nothing added and nothing moved and yet still spawn in a different spot from time to time.
---
There's no rhyme or reason about it.
---
sheer absolute luck
---
I‚Äôm confused. All I‚Äôm saying is that they marked it down significantly to a much more reasonable number.
---
This game will fibally start to look like a real MMO.... If Bethesda doesnt fait that...
---
No, no one killed scorched or scorchbeasts enmasse.  In fact we killed them even less than we do now because that community event was well before they even added legendary SB's later in the year.
---
Ignore the anti bloodied shitters. They have 0 idea what they're talking about.
---
You want to run full unyielding.
---
3 AP refresh, 2 Poison resist. Tier 3 is up to you.
---
Types don't matter right now, but they will when legendary perks drop.
---
You want to keep a gamma gun to control your rads.
---
Chem Fiend perk makes radaway remove more rads.
---
Use Dodgy and Serendipity for defense. DR perks are worthless.
---
SBQ deals explosive damage, so using Fireproof is extremely effective against her. Combined with Blocker, she will tickle you.
---
Me three..
---
Morgantown is really the only good spot for cobalt flux, but I just trade for it lol, 
---
plasma flamer is one of the most underused weapons in the game.  They are super strong and I rarely see people using them.  Best mob control for rifleman in my opinion.  I don‚Äôt use them anymore as I‚Äôve changed my build, but I will never get rid of the ones I have :)
---
I took him back to my workshop for *repairs*.

We there are actually quite a few choices, but knowing it's an online game, the choices cannot change a lot of things.
---
Key words: Radical Sons, RaRa, Johnny, Jen, last mission, Dailies.

I mean for an online game there are more than enough twists.

Queen of the hunt. Don‚Äôt take a sample. Reload and do it again
---
My problem with the BOS event is that I don't know how to do it... Sure I could watch a YouTube guide or look it up online, but I'm not fussed either way so I haven't bothered to look it up.  
---
I've only just dinged level 40, I do have a large part of the map since I like to explore a lot but I don't have a lot of higher-level area map places yet. I tend to fast travel to someone whose vendor is near a high-level place and explore a little bit to try to get some of the locations on the map, but I haven't come across any active BOS locations yet. Bethesda should have put some kind of a quest that activates as soon as you log in for the first time after the event started directing you where to go.
---
Dialogue is bugged on almost every wastelander npc
---
Someone did the math and figured out the community would have to do, like, 100x the man hours to build the Empire State Building in order to amass that much concrete.
---
Fall damage is great, and if you have another piece with then fall damage will be completely eliminated. Goat Legs are worse than two Fall Damage reduction legendary pieces. Pick it. 
---
However if you are still unsure and look at ammo weight reduction, well... IMHO it'd be better to use armor pieces with weapon weight reduction as you already have ammo weight reduction perks for ballistic and energy ammo, and even explosives, but there are no weight reduction perks for rifles.
---
However if you are a melee user, or if you only use pistols or heavy guns, then it might make sense to collect ammo weight reduction pieces. In that case you'd save I think two Special spots in Strength and 3 spots in Intelligence.
---
I love to switch between weapons from time to time and have freedom of which weapon to use, except melee. Melee is hard to use when you are not in PA. Why? In my opinion, as durability of the non-PA armor is far smaller and even if you have same numbers as in PA (my numbers are smth like 337 physical damage resistance, 357 energy damage resistance, and I think something like 250 radiation damage resistance, which are comparable to Excavator PA) you get downed way faster. So you want to avoid physical contact, and this is where having ranged weapons is useful. Thus rifles, ideally either one-shot (I love my Instigating Gauss Rifle) or quick shot (Furious FFR Powerful Automatic Assault Rifle/Fixer/Combat Rifle/Handmade). Thus using ammo reduction legendary armor piece is less efficient.
---
Anyways that's just my opinion, YMMV.
---
I'm a girl not a guy
---
I'm not "bitchin" I'm pointing out the ludicrousness of their target. It appears that Bethesda agree as they have now lowered it.
---
They changed it last night (UK time) from 150 million to 15 million.
---
You are the one misreading things not us
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i7f9f0/the_event_concrete_target_went_from_150_million/
---
Awesome, man. I'll add you ASAP.
---
Will probably start the settlement project on Friday night :)
---
this is what i was coming here to say
---
what's the matter guys? you don't have cork?
---
let's drink all the fking wine of appalachia!
---
Yes last night (UK time)
---
I stole it
---
This is the 3rd or 4th repost now, we got it.
---
There are multiple spawn points, but the CAMP placement sets where they are. I didn't believe this at first, but I have tested it multiple times now. Just because there is more than 1 spawn point though, it seems like it is random.
---
Grief on Take a Workshop day
---
Start a new character and do something out of your comfort zone
---
Our posts appear to have made them look at the figures again &amp; lower it drastically.... good
---
&gt; aswell as farming it from the monorail elevator and site charlie etc. 
---
Those are my top two farming sites. I looted those areas once and since then there has been zero concrete every single time that I check.     But those are not the only places. It's true of virtually every concrete hot spot I attempt to farm. Which goes back to the entire point of my thread: the concrete quantities in the map are way too small for us to complete something like this. My problem with the event is not with the rewards are the grind. But I can't gather stuff that is not there to be gathered.
---
No duh. If they did, they would quickly realize the 200 million cork goal is insurmountable.
---
Ss can't not use the jetpack and chest mod.
---
But yeah they nerfed sh hard. Ever pre nerf it wasn't great
---
You can't nuke Flatwoods. It's in the restricted area.
---
TBH I had one commando build and one Full melee build...
---
When I started to have that kind of problem, I just kept a Bloodied 33 VATS chance Minigun I got from the purveyor for my strenght build and never look back.
---
If you cant beat them, join them.... As sad as it is.
---
It aged beautifully they have now lowered it. I expect the reddit pressure was the antecedent to that

Water can be ice! It can also be a vapor!! A logical robot should goddamn well appreciate how specific someone is being when they ask for water ice Sunny!!!!!

I simply like power armor because it looks, feels, and sounds badass. Say what you want about me but I really don‚Äôt care about being good at the game I just love exploring and looking badass with heavy weapons. Other than that yeah it‚Äôs probably bad
---
yep
---
Possibly too late but we may have a chance
---
I agree with you
---
they reduced it last night (uk time) to 15 million
---
Personally? Not a fan of marsupial. Either way, fun post!
---
Ok Gamestop
---
Absolutely
---
dart boards
---
Spend hours trying to tame a mirelurk king, login one day and find it missing. Repeat
---
Idk if they forgot, or they don‚Äôt care. We all keep playing.
---
Nah, I love it when SBQ has been in the air for 25m thanks to BOS bunker shitters, and some dude pulls out hacked gun and finishes the event.
---
I get to launch more nukes and get more flux.
---
You want to talk about blood on someone's hands? How many Innocents have your abominations killed? The scorched, super mutants, you have NO room to make such accusations about murdered Innocents. 
---
However, as poor as it is to speak Ill of the dead, Paladin Taggerdy was wrong in how she carried out the orders of Elder Maxson.
---
Walk everywhere.  
---
I rarely fast travel and have seen lots and killed many.  
---
I mostly travel between the more and savage divide and see them on the cliff edges a lot.If you want more specifics I'll try collate my screenshots and locations of spawns a bit better.
---
In my experience I seem to spawn in the same vicinity regularly when there's not an ally or collectron in my camp. However, once I add either (or both) the spawn point variation is increased.
---
That‚Äôs the spirit
---
I was able to get Charlie quite frequently, however the monorail elevator seemed to be empty about 75% of the time. I gave up on farming it when I found that it was more just a waste of time than anything productive. Even NPC vendors selling it was fairly rare.
---
Or jus makes her not immuned to crippling, as she supposed to be since last patch
---
I've always wanted to stick a metal rod with a beautiful logo in the middle of a tire to watch it balance for 150M concrete.. Wait.. It's 15m now?! YES
---
Designed by Arthur Weasley himself.
---
Did you answer my question?
---
You cant compare it to Skyrim, where you are alone fighging.
---
Floats too
---
Yep, first paragraph - pick fall reduction.
---
Lmao someone's excited
---
Which bit?  
---
The images etc. were in a different post on here, but that was deleted. Is that what you're meaning, or the complaints about the BOS event in general?
---
Wait, could we target Atlas?
---
And pistols....
---
If you're not into the events and other stuff, which is perfectly okay, then yeah.. You're either waiting for new content or just doing the daily grind stuff to eventually build a god tier loadout. Outside of the daily quests/scrip/gold/cap grind you can go to the XP farms in hopes of some god drops, and you can farm flux and prime your weapons... But if again, if none of these things interest you it's probably time for a break until some new content is added.
---
You can scrap your blueprints (the ones that show up under stored) and it will store all the individual items making up that blueprint.  
---
\*EDIT\* On PC you press R to do this.
---
Use grenades to move a cow from one corner of the map to the diagonal opposite.
---
Yup. Even if you‚Äôre farming the workshops that have concrete deposits, it‚Äôs going to be too low for that goal. Fortunately they have retroactively reduced it.
---
They've reduced the number from 150 million to 15 million now. They should have checked they're figures at the start. Reddit pressure for the win
---
I have VATS three star anti-armor lever gun and I fucking love it
---
Im sure there are places that have a ton of pre war money to farm
---
I'm almost tempted to set up a camp beside it buying the junk at better prices than the rewards from the NPC. Which wouldn't be hard, lol.
---
Seen anyone donating?   No, but I saw someone nuke it yesterday.
---
I loathe hot weather. I lived outback in Oz as a teenager, give me snow &amp; rain any day
---
The whole post. Idk if they got deleted, but if it had a reason...
---
The bos event is garbage, and this shown idea is one of thousands better options. But reposting it every day (idk if it was you) doesn't make it better or track attention to Bethesda to change anything.
---
352 levels and attempt every time there is an update with a new character just on the off chance they fixed it.
---
I know I can get atoms for it with a ticket... but I'd rather the thing checked off.
---
Scrap Pre-War Money. So anywhere with cash registers.
---
I usually check kitchens, also military bases, since normally there is at least one pillow per bed. Asylum may be great too, can also search for military ammo bags there.
---
There is an unmarked location between Bolton greens and morgantown high school. When you're lucky you can find around 20 Cat bowls. Then go to morgantown high school and take everything in the Gym and the cafeteria.
---
Well Sunny, water have three stages of matter, frozen liguid and vapor. Just like you are both slow, dumb and delusional at the same time.
---
It's gonna be downhill until mods come.
---
If mods are neutered, then the game will die that day.
---
I‚Äôve created quest mods for FNV and yeah creating a quest like you‚Äôve described is a very easy thing to accomplish. It would‚Äôve taken no effort on BGS part to make this event more engaging but alas no.
---
If you can find one I prefer an instigating 40% power attack damage super sledge. Hits like a truck.
---
You dont eve  have to switch build.... Just get a magic minigun, Heavy gunner Mutations, Class freak (optionnal for better accuracy) and you are good to go without changing anyrhing in your build.
---
On my melee build, when I was low level and unequiped, I used to just use a Handmade to taf her and it was enough, even in the shortest fights
---
Go to the Morgantown airport. Go to the East side of the airport, past all the hangers and into the fenced-off "quarantine zone". This should auto-start the event "Collision Course", assuming it hasn't been started recently already on your server (it has a cooldown).
---
It's really easy, although time-consuming. It just spawns 5 small waves of min-level scorched, and at the end you're rewarded with a govt drop containing a guaranteed 100 cloth (well, 100 prewar money, but it scraps to cloth at 1:1).
---
The cooldown on this event is pretty short, and can be done as many times as you want for infinite cloth. You can also server hop this event if you don't want to wait out the cooldown.
---
If you decide to build from scratch, just place your camp somewhere else and delete the automatically made blueprints. It will delete the blueprint and move the relevant items to the 'Stored' tab. You won't lose anything unless you manually scrap it yourself (or if there's a bug of some kind..)
---
And also..  
---
#Don't use the FutureTec CAMP skin! Under any circumstances!  
---
It is bugged and will make it so nobody (including you) can fast travel to your camp - even if you have stocked vending machines.
---
... 
---
**BLUEPRINTS:**  
---
Blueprint manually and in clearly named sections.  
---
Never include vending machines or turrets.  
---
If it doesn't 'snap' to an object, don't include it in that blueprint - for example.. blueprint conduits seperate from walls and roofs, and if you have something sitting on top of something else, then don't blueprint it. Just cut your losses and accept that you will have to manually place some stuff. Better just a few things than a whole blueprint being unusable!  
---
Often foundations won't like to be placed unless you manually throw down a dummy foundation for the blueprint to 'snap' to. This can work for other things like walls and ceilings, too. There are ways you can.. coerce.. the system into doing what you want.
---
Seeing as you said you just started, this might not be relevant but... Quite a few items that have been overlapped using the "flamethrower trick" can be blueprinted and placed down the same way. This isn't major, but it will save you some repair costs and some time.
---
And if it is important, throw on the Contractor perk and test the blueprint to make sure it can be placed before you scrap the original! Or take over a workshop and make a few practice blueprints. If the required component is listed in **green** then it means it is coming from the workshop's resources and *not yours!*
---
Cloth is mega easy though that I don't even know if it's worth bothering.
---
For me, I've found places that banks or places with lots of cash registers or safes tend to have a lot of pre-war money, which is quite an efficient way of getting cloth.
---
There is a house in Summerville which has a whole lot of burned books. Probably get enough for one atlas box in there. Its on the main road at the north end.
---
Collision course event is also excellent - the crate at the end has around 100 cloth in it. Pretty sure the same goes for the crate at the end of dropped connection events.
---
You can take a part the stored structure and use all of the pieces that were used to build it.
---
Blueprints are really finicky and if you want a mobile camp then you have to be very careful what you put and where. Sometimes a workbench or object may clip into a wall slightly or hang over a foundation the wrong way and this can cause a blueprint to become unusable. The F1 scrap box also have a large mesh and can cause problems with blueprinting. Start off small and see what works and what doesn't, building takes a lot of experimenting in this game.
---
That‚Äôs not a human... That‚Äôs a MONSTER
---
Lol Yesssss we need more micro transaction!!!! Please Beth please everyone up vote!!!!!
---
This is kind of why I'm not doing anything for this event... I've never helped the Brotherhood in any of the Fallout games I've ever played and I'm not about to start now! üòÇ
---
Ples no more currencies. There‚Äôs like a dozen already.
---
You're a good friend!
---
I would go with option 1 - AP refresh speed is clutch
---
They‚Äôve since lowered the goal. I guess they realized the goal was too high with yesterday‚Äôs numbers.
---
Unfortunately achievement bugs plague this game. It sounds like you may have to try again on a different character. Did your quest progress?
---
Clearly he isnt the problem. The boss fight design is.
---
And you have to understand thaf on top of a bad design, its using a bug which makes it undoable for some bulds.
---
Not to mention that Bethesda should be pushing for build diversity, not brainless OP weapon users sitting on tents
---
They most likely would made a mutation of It lol
---
Yes I believe so
---
Btw mate, people will still buy your 30k stock with no remorse, especially if it's a good roll.
---
Yup. They saw how hard we were going to fail lol
---
Yeah I literally built my day one character around PA only to have it do absolutely nothing for me now, my whole character is just *okay*, after all that time and work, building up the excavator set and ultracite and XO1 and all that, means just about as much as BGS's efforts to fix the game now. 
---
And now I dont even want to play because I built what I deemed to be my most favorite camp ever made and I dont want whatever the hell update just dropped to fuck it up. So I guess it's time for my second major hiatus from the game since launch.
---
Yes i know juice head has a video with the full messages. There are more then one and data miners have had them decoded for a month or so.
---
Agreed - I tried grinding for concrete but came up way short.  And on a side note, the instant rewards you get from donating are total shite.
---
I've had that between two different platfos, been that way since release for me.
---
You shouldnt alter your build.... You dont have to change anything... Just get a Bloodied magic heavy gun and the range weapon mutations and you are good to go
---
Yes, the quest progressed.
---
Top-left of map, "Aaronholt Homestead", the cranberry field just outside the homestead location usually has several Bloodbugs and also Bloatflies too.
---
The post got deleted pretty quickly, I did reach out to the mods, waited two days but they didn't respond. So I took out anything that was overly critical of Beth. and reposted, but this is the first repost.
---
Apologies if someone else has plagiarised it and posted it again without me knowing though, that's just annoying!
---
People will still go furiously researching a way to complain about the change.
---
As already mentioned, you can get a guaranteed 100 prewar money by completing Collision Course in Morgantown Airport. Sometimes you can get very lucky on an old server and there will be 4 or 5 crates there already from people completing the event before you. You can loot the old crates as well and each will contain 100 prewar money in addition.
---
It just doesn't have the flag.
---

---
Im using jetpack and Buttressed :(
---
You're a little late to the party. It use to be broken but now Strangler is almost not worth the effort. Until T-65, it was the top tier PA.
---
As for PA benefits, generally more tankier, generally more durable so lower maintenance, almost a must for heavy rad areas (you can get by with CSS but you lose all armour benefits minus backpack anyhow), for heavy gunners it's almost a must due to Stabilized perk, the helmet mod that highlights things is more useful than you'd think and probably one or two more I haven't thought of.
---
PA could certainly do with more love but you make it out like there wasn't a time where PA was so dominant people felt like they were forced to use it due to all the benefits that came with it. It's only really until Wastelanders where PA was overtaken.
---
If you're playing Bloodied and have the Secret Service jetpack a case can be made for the Bolstering..... But assuming you're not there yet the Mutants with AP refresh is your best bet. AP refresh on your armor is amazing, and less ammo weight is way more useful than disease resistance in long term play.
---
No, they addressed the fix as a "possibility to exploit".
---
Seems some guys blueprinted a dropbag with items which got duplicated each time they joined a server or something like that, I recently stumbled across someone's camp who is using tools for nuclear winter and found a paperbag full of junk, weight more then 1k pounds. Someone on discord told me it was some kind of exploit they fixed with disabling wallreplacement.
---
Maybe they‚Äôve already bagged some sort of quota on exploiters so now they can change it.
---
Plastic cloth leather steel and wood are do-able. Plastic a bit less so. Wood is everywhere in the forest and toxic valley. Put on woodchucker and harvest away.
---
Option 2 - Bolstering.
---
Thanks, didnt know that. I came (to Fallout games overall) a little after WL was released. :(
---
Morgantown high school, watoga high school, fort defiance. The lunch/cafeteria areas of them. Plus the crazy cat lady‚Äôs house outside of Morgantown. 4 cat bowls by the monorail fusion core.
---
i got stuck playing the banjo during one violent night. so stuck that i couldn‚Äôt even move or exit for a while. i couldn‚Äôt even be killed by the ghouls lol. finally thought i was back to normal then looked over at my bf‚Äôs screen and i‚Äôm gliding around playing the banjo shooting bullets out my ass.
---
Checked the Event, South Hampton and Gorge. For some reason these littles bugs drop no meat while using Butchers Bounty. The % must be less that 1% or something.
---
This is brilliant. I love it. I have so maby plans I'm just selling hoping for lower levels buy the simple ones. I wouldn't mind selling the plans at half price or something to the BoS. I can't even describe how much i love this.
---
I have fallout first and grab and scrap everything. Had 5k concrete.
---
Agree.
---
Your nuke your rules. No üö©üö©üö© here.
---
May be a low chance. Or a bug (no pun intended!).
---
You are working that brand, aren't you.  Don't stop.
---
I get it, its just totally unsubstantiated.
---
We grind the materials, the scrip, the notes, the bullion, we should be able to do with the pieces we build whatever the fvck we want to.
---
Why doesn‚Äôt the ammo converter just have a traditional inventory trading interface? They made complicated af to exchange ammo
---
Just north of white springs, east of the blood eagles camp there is a lead pit. I built my camp here to mine lead and almost daily was attacked by a variant of the Flatwoods monster. If you aren‚Äôt married to your camp location you could set up there and wait for a bit. Or do what others have said and reload queen of the hunt
---
180 items
---
Haha
---
Legendary fixer is what you need.
---
All this without realizing they can‚Äôt even get deep pocketed for SS armor into the game correctly. 
---
You gotta lower your expectations! :)
---
I‚Äôd rather have the banner than the beret.
---
I think you gotta go to atom store, click CAMP, find the one you like or the one you dont like and click it. It will say "equip" or "unequip".
---
Bethesda just asked Russell Doresy to equip his perk cards, he's got a beauty reduces junk requirements by 90%...
---
Nobody‚Äôs even mad.
---
Yep no meat at all.
---
This is why I don‚Äôt even try concrete. When I read that dedicated Fallout 1st members do not have that amount in their infinite box, well it is not possible. 
---
Cork might be possible if an effort of pipe weapons farming is done. It is a hassle but still. 
---
Plastic is really doable if farming halloween and picnic stuff and energy weapons.
---
THICC stelth
---
"have to drop"?.... not when you can just log out and back in
---
Crack is wack! BOBBY!!
---
Report the player for what?
---
Fallout 3 had something similar with a man hitting his head against a lamp doing a bike jump. I think it was in the entrance to one of the Broken Steel areas.
---
An Excel sheet perhaps
---
The aura has been nerfed for quite some time already, always get you facts checked before doing anything stupid.
---
There's not much more I'm gonna say to someone who suspects that the game "shits itself" other than "nope." But yes, if someone intelligent and thoughtful like yourself had a question, I would strive to provide an in-kind reply.
---
Hah, just found out about this too.

Nah there is only 5 official currencies and 1 item based. Games like gw2 and wow have nearly a hundred, smaller mmos have like 20 and if you really get down to it, games like rust, 7days to die, and Ark have like 15 to 18. I wouldn't mind if we had either a few more if bethesda kept the cap, gold and script limits in place, otherwise they should drop those limits and keep it to three
---
Wait, really? Well that‚Äôs something.
---
Why would anyone donate their materials in a game that's this grindey? For a company that doesn't give a rats ass to give poop cosmetics??
---
Yes stop giving me alcohol!
---
What do you mean exactly, did you already buy it on the [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) launcher?  
---
Reason I ask is because the only thing I can think of that would make you want to use the bethnet version is atoms/fallout 1st sub, if the Steam copy is the only copy you own, you have no reason to use the bethesda launcher as far as I'm aware. If you wanna try, just download the launcher and see if you can log into it with the bethnet account linked to your steam account.
---
Just for clarity sake, you have to have Starched Genes times 2 before it's permanent.
---
One other place to try is the scorchbeast guano piles and the meat bags from supermutant areas. They can have meat in them so may be worth a look. The blue food pails may have some on occasion too 8 think.
---
Complicated? More like passive aggressive. Damn, I feel frustrated any time I try to use it like normal.
---
But it's not bad for grinding steel into railway spikes, then trading in those for whatever you need though. Steel is so easy to come by too.
---
I'd describe using it only for that as "barely tolerable."
---
The enclave bunker , I think 1000 caps. It‚Äôs up in that room past where you get the nuke card missions
---
I have to find it again, hopefully isn't just on my old hdd because dead cpu is dead, but someone did this to me during Fasnacht and I was just zooming around all the folks there flipping foodstuffs in their vicinity. It was silly so I had to get a clip.
---
At least the 'hunt' of chasing down the treasure hunters and listening for that sound...you know which one... that was fun.
---
Can't quite say there's anything fun about this one. Not that I'm not donating if I have anything, but I'm not really going out of my way for it.
---
I mean, what were they thinking? I don't think I've gathered more than 1000 concrete since I started playing, it's not like I need it to make ammo or repair my gear, I only use it when I'm rebuilding my camp, which I don't do very often.
---
It's things like this why people wonder if developers play their own games.
---
Had the same problem two months ago, first two week on my main, the camp always disappeared after being offline for several hours like the next day. I took the time and rebuilded it several times, but after a week or so I only placed the workbenches, a chest and nothing else. After several days then it didn't disappeared, i rebuild my camp and it were staying for the next days, but the camp from my alt were gone. Again, several days with a lot of wasted time rebuilding... support did nothing except the usual (delete config and such).
---
I ended up fixing it by placing my camp for free again, deleted everything stored  and replaced my camp again for caps (several times to be safe). Then I build only the very necessary items and waited a few days.
---
This. Best way to get money.
---
Also any cash registers or BoS body have chances of prewar money. Offices mights have some money also (seems like they had petty cash reserves). And equip your picklock perks because money is hidden in all those safes.
---
We got Caps, Gold, Treasury Bonds, Scrip, Ammo thingy(can‚Äôt remember name), Mr. Fuzzy Tokens, Miner Tokens (for that one event in Ash heap), Tickets for the Top of the world Protectron, and probably more that I can‚Äôt renmbember as I‚Äôm tired.
---
The Colossus has 10% flat chance fo be in any nuke zone.
---
The Brotherhood isn't that fucking stupid lol
---
Not a monster that is screws for me to loot
---
Looking at the rewards list, and not seeing a single plan I don't already know, and nothing else but shite to drop on the ground, is not really any incentive to donate anything.  They want to drain duped materials by offering the same duped plans you found in bags everywhere during the dupe wave as rewards.  Brilliant.
---
I'm pretty sure you'll still need to move CAMP also. What a poopy concept these skins are.
---
I think it is the cook, right? He is hilarious when he fails a meal.
---
Play Fallout 3 or NV.
---
Any good spots with lots of Blue Food Pails?
---
Try out your own Naked and Afraid by stripping all your weapons and gear, drinking a nukashine and then trying to make it back home without fast travel.
---
Yes the quantities are to high, the rewards aren't great.  But we did ask for such an event, we asked for location that gets build up over time, that changes as we do things. Granted what we got is simplified but we wanted something like it, we had post asking for something like it.
---
Not only will it be interesting to see new areas, it will be interesting to see areas we've been to before but almost two hundred years before we were there previously.
---
I like to think that is what Bethesda staff say every time they release an untested item to the Atom Store üòÖ  
---
"oh no! It is ruined! No - it is... on sale."
---
Can't say I've ever had those issues. but try posting it on here instead. I've found they actually listen here.
---
This event should have been a daily quest of some sort, like go there, find this object and donate it, kinda like Ward's dailies. I will never find 250 concrete.
---
They are ballistic, even the 2mm ammo got changed lately to be ballistic.
---
True. I have a ton of steel so no big deal donating 10k. Unpacking all the kits too longer than getting them.  I ended dumping most of it: grenades (non-plasma), booze and known plans. Plans are great, but the rest is not great.
---
Concrete is scarce. It's like wanting oil, aluminum, or adhesive in  huge numbers. These are used in practically  everything and a PITA to farm. Oil extractors are so slow. Aluminum extractors are okay, but acid intensive. Adhesive is a chore (mutfruit, corn, and tatos). I almost never have over 1k at any one time on any alt. Concrete is easy to get in small quantities when building, but not if you want thousands of units.
---
They are generally just anywhere around the map. There is usually one at each train station though - normally it is on the floor next to a seat. But they can be anywhere.
---
They shoulda have made custom public event for each part of the BOS supply requisitions. Every hour on the hour a public event that loads a Legendary "Stone" Grafton Monster that drops concrete and spawns smaller "Stone" Grafton Monsters that also drop... you guessed it "concrete". Players can farm the required supply/exp/legendaries/rare items... Leave the BOS requirements/rewards and the fact that we can still scavenge and scrap... event successful. I know theyre workn from home but come on. If theyre trying to be "unique" they gotta put effort into it otherwise follow the same format every other MMO follows and it should go smoothly.
---
Launch the [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) launcher and see if the game needs an update, then launch the game through the launcher rather than directly from the game folder.
---
Acid.  Acid to make lead scrap with, and it will be enough for that purpose.
---
Good to know
---
My advice is dump unusable ammo and keep the rest. You won‚Äôt ever have to deal with this bullshit again.
---
I miss understood. Thought you meant you were running a jetpack as well as dense
---
Why the hell wouldn't it just be a Brotherhood of Steel scouting party collecting resources? A fucking BoS fanboy seems so stupid, and lazy.
---
That's why the ammo machine blueprint was made. Fixes all those pesky and tedious ammo problems problems.
---
This
---
‚ÄúNewFlash‚Äù
---
Headline reads (power armour sucks)
---
Yes it does. Always has. Only good in nuke zones. Sorry you are just receiving this information now.
---
All technology needs to be confiscated our collected including steel and concrete and Victorum
---
Maybe including your build might help?
---
The only other option is to use an extractor but there are only so many extractor sites and no one ever gets any from it cus they are killed by the other 5 people who want it, then they kill each other.
---
This whole issue is part of the reason i run a standard Heavy gunner is that i can farm for an hour and restock. I am taking up issue because of the Gattling Gauss. Crafting and converting won't feed that beast. It's like getting the greatest xmas gift and the having to wait 4-6 weeks for the batteries that were not included
---
Can't get it but one of juicehead's videos has the invite link
---
It doesn't make 2mm
---
I might actually donate some concrete to this now.
---
Go to the &gt;!Southern Belle Hotel!&lt; and read a note on one of the tables.  This should help you get started
---
That ammo machine is a fucking disgrace. It was shit but usable- since patch its purely shit.
---
If someone asks me for water next time imma blow hot steam in their face. I won't be going to jail guarantee it!
---
Thank you
---
Oh I know, I have over 3k hours on here. I have over 280 good weapons on my vendor character and sometimes just give things out to people if I can tell they're new. I dont keep anything worth more then 30k in there so if one sells and I eat 15k caps its not a big deal. 
---
I'm extra bummed because I've had this camp for awhile now and I have so many weapons that I can fill the whole machine with just anti armor or furious or junkies etc. The blank space you see there is where I change my daily special, which I can no longer do.
---
I say Mirelurk Kings
---
I don‚Äôt know if you already know, but it‚Äôll be in interval. The first one is in the atomic shop right now (:
---
Before SH sets got duped like mad, the aura was amazing. After the dupe, six people at SBQ would lag/crash the server so Bethesda gutted it. 
---
It's still a good set, but not much better than any other.
---
Ah shit i gotta go get it, know when its going away? Does it say? My ps4 is off for the night
---
I would be suprised if any of the dupers would have bothered risking being banned over concrete.
---
Lol...I am level 169. I as well had to Google the location....And much to my surprise when I tried to fast travel there...I couldn't....I had never been there.
---
Ever done a nuke silo on public worlds and noticed suicidal turrets exploding as son you are approaching? 
---
Its just the load order. First, the game loads all assets from the server, it says "enemy 1 on this position, enemy 2 on that position etc", after this is done several other infos are downloaded till finally the "mob x is dead" info gets loaded. The client is requesting specific infos only on sight to not stress the server.
---
Don't think it works that way around, although I may be mistaken. I think you'll need to download the Bethesda launcher and see if the game is in your library and redownload it from there.
---
Theres like 20 posts dude
---
Yea I didn't either b/c Bethesda in their infinite wisdom didn't have any in-game notifications. Had to see it on the fucking dev blog.
---
Should also buy our excess technical data too
---
Normally I bite my tongue when I see people misjudge development processes, but for this I have to speak out because ...
---
SQL Database for resource balancing?
---
That shit should be in a spreadsheet, with formulas and graphs galore! If not a tool like machinations.io. Whatever it is, you're actually giving them way too much slack to say a SQL database - it should be visible, front-and-center with someone actively managing it's balance on a constant basis.
---
If I caught a game design student balancing resources in a database (or worse, direct in the live environment) they'd be failing my class.
---
Exactly 13 weeks  9 hours and 24 minutes from now it will rotate back into the shop
---
Does it change the damage, or just make it easier to find ammo?
---
Imagine wanting to fail the event just to prove a point.
---
Do you have Pleasant Valley Claim Tickets? If you turn in a bunch at once you'll end up with lots of pre war money aka cloth as well as the more desirable stuff
---
Imma be honest, I ain‚Äôt giving those stuck up crackas shit.
---
It's not even a fair conversion rate. If you accidentally sell the ammo you're trying to buy, it a 3 to 1 rate. You have too sell 3000 of a single type of ammo to get 1000 of the same type.
---
Hands up if you've tried to kill Davey üñê
---
Sunny is the best Sunny.
---
It's going to be themed around power armors, as starting with Fo4 PA is basically a vehicle and you are its pilot. 
---
Ghillie for each power armor type incoming...
---
0
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how much ammo you can make in later levels, I made like a thousand cryo cells yesterday
---
It's the mounted head you're after right? Not the 3 heads on a stick?
---
Steel I donated about 2000. 
---
Concrete, only 750 so far. It‚Äôs so much harder to get concrete.
---
And for real who the fuck actually has the megaton amounts it wants??
---
Honestly we just need to have a sell all option, not incremental BS. Shit ammo worth a credit, better ammo two or so credits (PER BULLET), and an option to buy what we want from the credits.
---
Sick of standing there holding my d1ck GUESSING what ammo I have to sell, only to be told I don't have enough.
---
The mounted head I already know about the colossus
---
lol I never noticed that one and I must have walked past it a thousand times.
---
Why you on so many postsüò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I'd like to see the Secret Service partner up with MODUS, get a message from Raven Rock, then have one of our new Expeditions be to take a set amount of gold back to the reestablished Fort Knox in Kentucky. Would be cool to shift it down there since WV is never really talked about by FO3 time, but I think even less is known about Kentucky.
---
Cool cool, just had to be sureüëç
---
Join the Army.
---
Then F76 isn‚Äôt for you if every single thing makes you question Bethesda
---
Nope
---
Nah but I just trade in lots of 5mm and buy 2mm from the converter. It's nice really I dont have to store lots of 2mm in my stash
---
Private &amp; all 3 Power plants makes 9? An hour. I think. Or hop whitesprings and exclusively kill the 3 sentry bots. That gives 50% cores but you can easily get a shit ton quickly.
---
Unless they've patched it recently, when I tried it a couple of patches ago the description was actually wrong. You can recover or even cure diseases just the same as normal.
---
The damage was also really disappointing. It's supposed to scale with the number of diseases you have, but since there's a ~30 min cooldown between catching each disease (unless you server hop) this made it really impractical to be used for any sort of meaningful damage, especially since the diseases still wear off at the normal rate.
---
It's a gimmick mutation and not really worth it. Also, it ruins any instigating melee weapons you might have, and makes all brahmin run away from you so they cannot be milked.
---
Exactly
---
You lot are like toddlers who learned a new word and can't stop repeating it.
---
Still not gonna donate my precious concrete
---
......Donated? What's going on, now?
---
I feel like this reward is more just a way to log your play time
---
You lost me at report the player.
---
Okay, thank you sm!
---
Vampire has a set amount it heals with every bullet/projectile.
---
Having a shotgun fireing 8/16 projectiles healing you 8/16 times more then other projectiles.
---
Key is not in the crib for me. Just finished with becketts brother. In that creepy room. Crib is empty. No I did not pick it up. I checked my keys.
---
Hey is that considered a heavy or a rifle?
---
The plan is a reward from project paradise. There is no vendor that sells them. You can buy them from other players though
---
If you go to the market sub you can get some pretty easily
---
Many bugs that haven't been fixed in 2 years.  The solution is sucks for you, Bethesda isn't fixing it.  :(
---
Take any of the power plants to farm them. Poseidon is the most robust in terms of additional resources
---
Ok but what about italian ice?
---
There are more benefits to 3rd person like no recoil animations
---
I‚Äôm personally a fan of the .50 receiver on my hunting rifle, I can craft much more ammo at a time with very little effect on damage.
---
Lever Actions are probably the signature of the semi auto build, I use mine all the time. (I can trade you a bloodied if you‚Äôre interested)
---
Railway hits hard and is a pretty good choice if you have a steel extractor.
---
While the handmade is generally a commando pick it‚Äôs certainly a good option if you have a lot of 5.56.
---
And the Fixer is a given.
---
This happened to me a few weeks ago, but it was a grill so my guy was flipping invisible burgers for eternity.
---
Fast travel doesn't cancel the bug unfortunately, you have to log out and back in again.
---
Whatever amount they set. I wouldnt be keen to participate in time wasting events
---
Exactly what im doing now.
---
No, taking plants always results in getting attacked.  Farm pa frames and take the fusion cores from them.
---
im so confused as to why the hell some random wastelander thinks a militarized faction whose leadership being centered all the way on the west coast is making a big ass comeback after their chapter settled in appalachia got shitfucked has decided to build a whole ass base for them, not knowing how they'll react be it hostile or not
---
Will do, thank you
---
Wow so the guys who built hoover dam must have spent a LOT of time server hopping.
---
No one is forcing you to run a guass. I use handmade and fixers and am sitting on hundreds of thousands of rounds. Whenever I see a level 15 I craft them a gun and give them 5k ammo.üòâ
---
Wow you got upvotes! I say the same and get hammered for being a shit bloke.
---
They aren't getting a morsel of my cork.
---
Line in the Sand gives a couple of guaranteed fusion cores in the event reward. The other BoS quests (technical data quest, Heart of the Enemy, etc) have a chance to reward fusion cores at the end.
---
Or you can kinda cheese them into existence, by crafting gatling lasers - which come with a free fusion core and cost no flux to craft - and then scrapping them, and repeat.
---
He has the contractor perk and the brotherhood radioed ahed to say they will share the perk as well.
---
If you're on PC let me know - I can sell you 3 diffusers required for scout challenge.
---
Lol this sub is very fickle. All depends on who see it haha
---
Duty ?
---
So what if it‚Äôs a gimmick? This game‚Äôs meta is so bland and uninteresting they need more stuff like this. Also thanks for the help.
---
Honestly, the provision box we get for donating is pathetic, I donated about 2500 an of the 10 boxes I got, I only got 1 decent thing out of it. As for the event rewards, the only ones I care about are the end ones (the challenge rewards for the last 2 in alpha and the purveyor sale and bonus meat wee from the last 2 in bravo).
---
I dont need or care about the cosmetics. Are hey cool? Yes. Would I like them? Of course. But 3 days to make 600 000 donations of a scrap item that's only found in 4 junk items that are already hard enough to find is impossible.
---
As for the people who say to just use the concrete extractors, that's not possible for everyone. I only know of 1 workshop that has a concrete deposit (there might be more, but I dont know which ones). Yes, I could hop onto a private server and grab it and afk for a few hours, except i dont have fallout 1st because where I'm from it's simply too expensive. Itll cost me half a months pay. So private servers arent possible for me.
---
Same thing with cork. Other than pipe weapons and golf balls, I have no clue where to even get the stuff, and we need to donate 200 000 000 of it.
---
The only ones I'm (relatively) confident about are the bravo ones, wood is pretty easy, leather I can go hunting, cloth is clothing and glass is... just everywhere.  Plastic... maybe, as there are a few places with a decent amount of it. Again though, plastic is used by players, and as a shotgun build, I use a shit ton of the stuff. So who knows.
---
Yeah that 317 days of straight gaming. 
---
Or 950 days (2.6yrs) if you play 8hrs a day.
---
Or 1900 days (5.2yrs) if you play 4hrs a day.
---
The brotherhood repeatable missions will be to intercept scavengers who are trying to bring them more scrap, and the reward for completion will be scrap.
---
Where can I get the gatling laser plan if you remember?
---
I am tentatively optimistic.
---
I've donated only 2k of stell, the rest mats I'm not going to donate even a scrap - the rewards are not worth it.
---
I believe its actually 12 weeks.
---
I really wanted to destroy the raiders on my BoS character, but couldn't even hurt them. And I wanted to join them on my evil character, but they were so bland I just scrapped that character, just did their quest on my main. maybe if the Enclave update comes out and beth does them like they are suppose to be, like they were in previous fallout games I can have a proper evil character.
---
No problem, also some events give cores too, line in the sand always seems to award 2 for me. Also making a prime gun &amp; ultracite cores will fully recharge a near empty fusion core. So 2x the worth, and PA should/used to take Ultracite cores too.
---
Mentioned this in another thread but everything about it is just lazy. Like why not have a BoS scouting party setup there with a vertibird and other equipment. Give us quests to do for them, or tag along with them. A simple horde event alongside some paladins killing super mutants, THAT PLEASE. Legendary drops and BoS themed stuff that doesn't suck, a fucking I &lt;3 BoS t-shirt would be better than a beret. 
---
But no, we get a guy and his box...
---
if u know the plan you can also craft an Gattling Laser LvL. 25....  
---
it gives u one core per Laser + Superduuper u can doople them ;-)  
---
\- one little bad thing is to get enough Fiber Optics  
---
(microscopes , bio.-scanner from turrets + mostly robots )
---
Lmao ok, here we go again with this
---
There would be a way, there always is. Plans can't be sold to vendors but there was still a glitch that allowed them to be duped in the recent vendor glitch. Shpacant be traded but was still able to be duped and traded. Atomic shop backpacks were tradeable recently. The list goes on
---
Why?  
---
"Rather than flee, the soldiers decided to continue manning their posts until the bitter end, trying to buy as much time for Appalachia as possible."
---
I just spent 900 atoms this morning to blaze my way on SCORE to get the Bloody Eagle paint for my 40% swing speed, +30 damage to bots Super Sledge I've affectionately named 'Wham Bam'.
---
I've found better weapons since I picked this beauty up at level 40 but... I keep coming back to the sledge as it's just too much fun bashing bots to pieces with it. 
---
As of now, every roll I make for the foreseeable future will be attempts at getting another increased swing speed sledge.
---
Take a nuclear Power plant, If you have Fallout 1st is better, only need to pass by every 30 minutes to empty the producer. You can Farm a lot this way. If you are on Xbox i can spare some for you.
---
I have a right/left bolstering + faster ap regeneration combat arm if youre interested.
---
I also have a shitload of unyielding combat chest pieces if youre into in those.
---
Ps4: kainzi_Z
---
is all fake, they will autocomplete it even when we do nothing now. Creates a feeling about how many players actually care, but its fake. I dont think 12 million is real number too. We will see it on CORK donate, which is XY time harder to get.
---
we dont know anything yet, just that new stuff will come at some point.
---
Nope. That sight is way off
---
Edit. Especially way off for vendors. Stuff in vendors needs to be priced very cheap. That sight is based on the pc market place. So you'd have to go to the market sub. But even for that I find it unusable. And people that are over their all the time (like myself) will tell you not to use it
---
With bethesda it would be a daily 1000 caps or whatever limit, so you have to log in countless times to sell all your plans. Also, im tired of buying legendary modules every day and craft secrect service armor only to recieve trash stats.
---
2 mm ec is perfectly efficient for me, for the minigun too.
---
This. /Thread.
---
(Server hopping abbys bunker would be best option #2)
---
Is ie25 double a magic? I'm just curious.
---
It's worse. Give up junk for your stash for what are essentially pails/presents, only with out the loot exclusive to pails/presents.
---
I do have fallout 1st so I'll definitely use it to my advantage,  and thanks but I play on ps4
---
You still get the rewards
---
Do not be hyped, do not expect anything. You wont be dissapointed when it arrives ...
---
Literally 0, previous days i just forgot to pass by atlas, and today when i go there i just dont have that amount of concrete to just toss away.
---
Pretty sure they stopped letting sentries give fusion cores
---
I accidently did that too on sunday. Sadly i teleported to the bunker and got fried immediatly - and lost all the stuff i collected inside the silo :(
---
You seemed to hit a nerve there, good.
---
Also pa no longer takes ultracite fusion cores. And when it did it reverted them to normal cores when placed inside of the pa
---
Boom
---
The cores in pa frames are always at 25% now. Not a good place to get them.
---
Thanks for the information it's very helpful and I'll be sure to remember them! It's kinda funny seeing the comments of a post getting more upvotes than the post itself makes me smile seeing posts similar.
---
i thought blood sac's drops from ticks ?!.....  
---
but who knows what for "hidden features" was includet in patch 21 :D :D
---
I bet you say that to all the girls.
---
I wanted to donate but only have 260. I ain‚Äôt about to give my stash in case my camp is nuked.
---
Been this way for a loooooong time
---
Since when? I noticed the last few days I hadn't been passively collecting and I kill a couple of em a day. Wasnt sure if it was a bug or not.
---
good to know. Thanks üëçüèº
---
A food build is a player using a build that has lots of QoL perks and not enough damage output perks to be helpful in PvE or PvP.
---
I don't really understand how you can be hyped for something we have 0 concrete info on tbh, it could be the best addition to the game, or it could be ward's daily 2.0 tier of "go there loot that kthx come back tomorrow" 2 minute job.
---
For quite awhile now. I believe at least since wasetlanders. Though am not 100% sure on when
---
This machine is awfull, i sell all kinds of ammo in my vendors for 1c each, the ones that anyone buys i put into overseers public stash. I really hate this machine and the endless backs to leave it.
---
It either said 7 or 9 days, I can‚Äôt remember which tho. I have a bad memory haha, but you‚Äôve got time, don‚Äôt sweat!
---
The Brotherhood of Simps is coming to Appalachia because we want to clap them Overseer‚Äôs cheeks. We‚Äôre just masquerading as the Brotherhood of Steel. We need all that cork for the soundproofing when we have massive orgies when the Overseer says our names after donating hundreds of thousands of caps and resources.
---
Camden park. Pick up everything.
---
I think the armor prices are outdated (over-priced now), as everyone wants SS armor.  I do price desirable weapons (Bloodied, Insta, Junkies, Furious) about 10-20% below the minimum price estimate, and they often sell at a reasonable pace (within a month).
---
Edit: PS4 fyi
---
I got a month of 1st and am cramming the scrap box as full as I can, to last me a while once it expires. I think I'll miss the tent, though.
---
Or maybe some actually unique weapons that we don‚Äôt already have similar of. There‚Äôs already too many rifles
---
Fallout first So I donate 250 x4 and that‚Äôs that
---
lol yeah right. not gonna happen.
---
I would go 1st option.
---
Of course not. Fallout 76 isn't about player choice, it's about player monetization.
---
Thanks. What is that mark next to your name and how to get one
---
How much are we talking for diffusers?
---
Ty :)
---
I do not have the ability to get weapon weight reduction on much of my gear. I am lucky as it is that I have a friend able to give me high level bos armor. Having a full set of t51b power armor was my next accomplishment.
---
My zero concrete will be donated. It‚Äôs zero because they‚Äôre stupid cunts.
---
I do not have emergency protocols available to me. I only use the power armor in irradiated areas as my physical resistance is only below the PA by 100~ points or less. I often get hit much more often in PA so I end up with more damage overall.
---
The prices are set for the Pc Market. For consoles the prices are always cheaper because the player amount is lower. 60% works for me
---
I just ended not doing this, not worth all that shitty loadscreens and annoying lobbies.
---
When I died inside a radiation barrel I had to get myself stuck again to retrieve my junk (since you can't jump back out and you had to go in it to reach the bag). I just dropped a bunch of random stuff like trash guns I was gonna scrap and 10 grenades, hopped in, picked it all up, and fast travelled out while popping a radx. I'd prob do the same in a fissure haha. (Probably with PA tho)
---
He died as he lived. Being Radicool
---
I thought that if it's so extremelly difficult to fix, maybe change it a little - like add one location to Ash heap challenge and add Wendigo Collossus to big monster and we'll be able to finally finish that challenges. I'm almost 3k hours in the game, I have only few challenges left to do (for Atoms) but most of them are absurd - 7600 items build in the CAMP, 7600 wood collected and other with 7600. I'd gladly get those lousy 160 atoms collected and challenges checked...
---
I only use it to know if a weapon is actually worth something specially when I'm unsure about the legendary attributes or it's a weapon of a build i don't know much about. 
---
I don't think the numbers are reasonable tho. I've seen camps selling at the suggested prices with letters on the wall that say something along the lines of "price check fed76" like saying "i know my weapons seem overpriced, but check the website BRUH that's what they are worth"... and i'm like yeah you wish.
---
100 caps each
---
I honestly don't remember. I'd say settings in-game but it's prob easiest to Google. That is what I did when someone said the same thing to me :p
---
\- North / North East + the lenge of 4-5 foundations is MOSTLY the spawn point of   
---
player who not in your team. You have an different spawnpoint as your tamewmates.  
---
\+ be sure that u near the spawnpoint do not have any stairs that clips half in the ground are somthing like that.  
---
This is NO 100% workaround but it helps alot to make the spawning for U and the others less terrible
---
It is for those that are not participating and the reason why. If you dont like the answers thats you issue. I havnt donated once on any toon as im not a trained monkey working for scraps. Its the general feel out there and ignoring it is being intentionally ignorant. Game is so broken now its not worth turning on for many people. Thats the main issue.
---
Nope i totally agree
---
My level 90 melee char kills them with 3 hits. The gigantic mirelurks that spit acid are sometimes a bit tough.
---
I love this post :D
---
I've found a few torture chambers with skeletons cuffed to chairs and stuff like tongs, knives, batteries and drugs lying on nearby tables.
---
I'm trying to recall some of the other scenes I've found.
---
The event "Free Range" always spawns 2 waves
---
Nice
---
You can open a ticket addressing this issue with a screenshot showing you at the missing locations.
---
They will give you the atoms, but the challenges will remain uncompleted.
---
Can you hold them? I won't be on for about 11 hours, just gonna shower and start work
---
neither of those this weekend.
---
Xbox. 8 nukes on fissure prime.
---
climbed the run nicely.
---
It still adds poison to all weapon damage, people act like thats nothing.  All PA also carries the silent stat of 45% damage reduction on the posted values which isn't as much as one gets with perks, no, but considering the high numeric values you do get in SH and T65 it about breaks even.  It's not as bad as they say if you enjoy being a gundam.  And no, I'm not a food build.  If you like it, play it.
---
This is just a reskinned treasure hunter event with the same nerfed reward list, full of plans you found in bags everywhere during and after the last events, and garbage to drop on the ground.  The reskinned beret and BOS fatigues that broke the underarmor and turned them into an outfit and the banner are not really worth the effort, and impossible if you don't pay sub fees, due to weight limitations imposed for a monetary solution.  No effort on their part = no community effort.
---
I'd like to see Beth do literally anything other than the BoS again.
---
Bethesda finally figure it out too 4-5 hours ago. Concrete has been cut to 15 million. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events Been at 12.53 mil since they changed it, don't know how often they update it.
---
Every time I've server hopped I've claimed Poseidon, buildt the concrete extractor, and plastered ATLAS on it in neon letter lights and left it unlocked.
---
A few moths ago I found them at two random encounter spots in a row.
---
How about those ultracite leg mod plans? Now that would be a big carrot.
---
Check whiesprings vendors inside the house, they sell pa recipes
---
Same
---
Yes! Yes! Embrace your anger! The enclave is waiting to welcome you with open arms!
---
np, I'll be online in 11 hours time, it'll be 8PM CET. Just write me here your ign and tell me when you can join, I have them in my vendor.
---
get better stock
---
I definitely wish they would have done more around 76 lore. Free States / Responders were very interesting. But they know they will be able to pull out a ton more sales on those weekly new 12-18$ BOS theme power armor skins.
---
Yeah melee is tough for that... probably should get a 90% reduced weight heavy gun and some big guns bobbleheads and psychotats and get your tag in on her while you can (what is it, 1500 damage or something?) and then if you want to do melee just go back to that and hope she lands.
---
As for the magic weapons... I usually just wait and get to the event a little late to make sure someone isn't going to end it 10 seconds in.
---
Theres so much thay could do with starting up the new ones again or some survivors form them showing back up kinda like the Raiders in wastelande
---
Savage
---
Well I know that but I was wondering about caps outside of box or player vending legendaries. Sorry I‚Äôm fairly new and I spent a lot of time scripping before I noticed the player marketplace
---
set up purified water machines, get the water in bulk. sell and max out the vendor
---
Put all ammo you don't use for 1c each in vendors, regardless they price tag
---
Put all your non desirable legendary stuff for about 100c each
---
If you have some uncommon outfits but easy to find, sell them for 50c
---
I do this and never get above 10k caps.
---
What intrigues me that they apparently mentioned them taking place ‚Äúall over the world‚Äù while I don‚Äôt think a full fallout game not in America would work these expeditions could be an amazing opportunity to show off other countries in fallout.
---
Already did that, I‚Äôm getting like 100 an hour (like 15 of each type in camp). But can‚Äôt sell them cause I already maxed them today
---
source? didnt heard anything on that topic
---
I have the same issue, plus think there‚Äôs one about killing big enemies and says I‚Äôve not killed SBQ before which I have several times.
---
shows up in the 'forest.
---
A player would have aggro'd it and drawn it out. Won't just show up. That player needs a commendation, not a report.  More carnage and mayhem is always welcome. :)
---
Just unfortunate that it is really nothing more than an ammo sink currently.
---
Regarding Silo runs. You will find it easier as you go. Soon you will be soloing it too.
---
It works for a couple of times, then stops
---
And you have to wait for the next day
---
What are some uncommon but easy to find outfits you would recommend?? Any tips help
---
Its flair, I think you go to your account on here and you can choose it, but I'm still fairly new to reddit and I don't remember the exact steps sorry!
---
Im deadass nuking atlas after update...
---
5.56 is dropped regularly.
---
Fuck all that I've got the remedy: there's this wonderful thing endgame players do called pvp.  It's where you put all that top tier gear you've been collecting to a real test against a viable opponent.  It may sound scary compared to cooking and collecting concrete or whatever the hell these guys are doing but I swear it's cathartic.
---
Sorry to correct, but its on the main page of this sub.
---
Yeah that's a great idea, the arc also makes dealing with throwable explosives a lot easier,I didn't really notice that you hadn't added it as I focused on the defensive perks, your build would look something like [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f58755b&amp;d=sw2s22sx2pq1p00l71ls2lt2lu2a04ib4c72cu2eh2ej4sg2sf2pj1&amp;wp=w8) then.
---
Ironclad and barbarian should bulk you up quite a bit together with blocker and fireproof (130dr 50er &amp; -45% to explosive, flame and melee attack damage) and the 15 strength is generally really nice at it gives you plenty of carry weight
---
make multiple characters, transfer said water to said characters. max out their caps. give them to a middle man. rinse and repeat
---
&gt;You don't ask a toddler to play in the NFL and then suddenly make the end zone 5 yards away as a "solution".
---
Yeah but if at first the end zone was 10 miles away, and eventually you realised what a moronic idea that was and moved it to the other end of the pitch instead, that would make sense.
---
Not letting Bethesda off the hook for making the mistake in the first place, but this is the best solution to that stupid situation.
---
Just hold the back button down, straight out...?
---
Oh! Did someone say orgies!?!?
---
Hahahahaha, I'm DYING for a TDM mode that we can use our Adventure load outs in. I know it's wishful thinking but MAN it'd be so fun
---
This is a very good idea
---
Vault tec jackets sell good in my machine, also red dress, this two have static spawn points. Asylum colored hats also sell well for 40c each, and you can get a bunch of it fast. Low level hazmat suits also sell good.
---
Great big gay ones, while we‚Äôre wearing our true clothing - *Mr Fuzzy outfits.*
---
The power armor is just to look cool outside.
---
Played NV like 5 years ago and got about two hours in and kept dying because nub and never went back. Been thinking about giving it another go tho
---
You at max Scrip of daily cap?
---
Umm where did you hear that?
---
This is kinda the first thing that came to mind, but I feel like I'm still fresh enough to the game that it won't be too fun. Maybe a few months from now I'll have forgotten enough of the story to do this and enjoy it
---
The spelling...my eyes :-)
---
Which plan is that you are searching for?
---
As long as they are cool for solo players too, Im excited too. I end up leaving this type of games when all the new content is for groups.
---
I‚Äôve seen a skeleton outside a water pipe with a saw and detached skull a foot away like the dude decapitated himself somehow.
---
I do like the events, it usually takes me at least repeats to get bored of them. I wanna do the harder ones like Project Paradise or Radiation Rumble but nobody on Xbox ever goes to them and soloing them sounds like an actual nightmare. 
---
But yeah, it's really a bummer that the BOS stuff isn't coming for quite some time. Even the Colossal Problem didn't appeal to me, it's just another long fight and grind. 
---
I think a LOT of this would be remedied if I had friends that played with me
---
 Biggest hoard of raiders you say, have a read: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/History\_of\_the\_Enclave#:\~:text=Origins&amp;text=One%20of%20the%20few%20old,nation%20could%20not%20survive%20it](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/History_of_the_Enclave#:~:text=Origins&amp;text=One%20of%20the%20few%20old,nation%20could%20not%20survive%20it).
---
Fuck
---
You can still exchange it.
---
I'm on antidepressants
---
Do you have the ghillie suit or the camo skin equipped ? If it has any skin equipped you have to remove the skin to be able to scrap it.
---
On InnovSurvivalist's Yt channel. I was surprised too that why I initially asked. I dont know her sources but she claims that it was said at quakeCon
---
Nope!  I‚Äôve tried for the last few days when script is 150, I‚Äôve got about 250 total in inventory.
---
Just found this out after getting enough caps for the Jetpack.... It's a sad day
---
Signs and Letters lol, I‚Äôm into camp building
---
Yeah I came across the eyebot a few times, the guy running away from the chicken, the Mr Handy leading a bunch of dogs, the Mr Handy about to self district..... A bunch of different ones, yet only met these two bots the one time.
---
Quakecon
---
ah, okay. just saw she made a new video but didnt see it so far. thanks
---
I have the mutation that gives 100 rad resist, and they still kill me so fast if I dont run from the beam
---
Whatever I don't want for slightly more than I can get by selling to a vendorbot with Hard Bargain 3 and Grape Mentats.
---
If I hit the scrip limit and still have trash legendaries, I'll pay them forward at anywhere from 40-100 caps depending on how much scrip you'd get from them. Even good legendaries I sell for like 500 caps, tops.
---
Plans, dirt cheap as well. I usually do 10 for recipes, 5 for mounted creatures, 15 for CAMP objects, 25 for weapon and armor plans, 40 for power armor plans, and the White Russian(and all other alcoholic beverages) recipe is always free(the Dude would want it that way).
---
I do have a bit of a dick move I'm pulling where I have those utterly worthless(yet also weightless!) Blank Holotapes for sale, trying to see if I can sucker anyone. Every once in a while I'll make a sale! I only have them set to like 25 caps, though. Not trying to break anyone's bank with this scam.
---
Awesome, thanks. My ign is bigsiege
---
Too bad the glitches are dead.  I was doing an entire rank a day til one day I nearly had an aneurysm
---
that's a great idea and I really hope they do it as those lunchboxes are just such a nice boost and it would make me way more willing to randomly waste them at the start or end of events
---
No worries:D
---
No. But camo paint on some that I‚Äôm trying to sell.  I wear full camo.
---
I'd do it too haha
---
Don't worry. You can server hop until you find it again. It's not gated behind some daily rotation or anything. So get your caps ready and then server hop the same vendor until you find it again.
---
Also, why wouldn't the BOS choose one of the airports? Would make much more sense...
---
I have to admit that I donated only 250, I can‚Äôt be bother to donate more üò¨ üôà I find this event a bit boring and the prize are a bit rubbish. And I love fallout, I have been playing it intensely for one year.
---
I've been finding lots of Cranberry recently but I've still never encountered a Grape or Dark in the 'wild'.
---
You can buy them from the Nuka bar though.
---
You are invulnerable for a couple of seconds after fast travel. Extend this timer and even the slowes ones will be able to tp away from any trap.
---
You need to remove any purchases mods first
---
Yeah.  NGL, I was kind of crushing on Abby after listening to her holotapes and Wallace is probably my favorite vendor bot.  Free States and Responders were both interesting new factions.
---
As I said I didn't remember the steps to do it, no need to apologise.
---
Same with .45.
---
A full suit of PA gives a 42% Damage reduction and a 90% Rad reduction BEFORE actual resistances applied. 
---
Makes your Str 11 (if lower), you have Calibrated Shocks for carry weight bonus (with ExPA that‚Äôs +200)
---
Got it! Thanks for the help!
---
I will do my part - by drinking lots of wine. You get cork by drinking wine right? You know - because there is that little cork plug that seals up the bottle...
---
no? Then what happens to the cork plug?
---
If it has atom shop skins it cannot be vendored (atom icon after name). Ghillie from LR counts too.
---
Items with skins can not be sold.
---
Got it! Thanks for the helpful replies!
---
Definitely worse seeing as how I actually got most of the rewards without grinding too crazy, all you had to do was save and transfer around 30-50 ornate pails or the mid tier ones to a new character to open them and you‚Äôd get multiple copies of the new plans.
---
God Bless America. God Bless The Enclave.
---
She said new weapons as in the new cursed weapons from the new event. We have known about cursed weapons for a while now.
---
Thanks for putting this out there; you helped me and my friends get it updated!
---
Sure? I won a lot of matches while our premade was only 2-3guys, and there were a lot of random bushwookies who emoted hearts as we won. Also alot of afk bushes started to fight on  our side as they noticed they are close to a win and have decent teammates.
---
Its your decision to play alone, but having teammates while going afk role-playing as Bush is only a win, since there are 3 less enemy's. Nothing to loose, everything to win.
---
Wasn't...the point of this event to be a BoS fanboy who WANTS the BOS to come to Appalachia, so we help him build up this former base in order to draw in the BOS to have a place to establish themselves? He's not with the BOS, he's literally trying to go "BOS! Over here! Set up over here!"
---
My man, I hear you.  I'd always prefer new pvp avenues but some Free States would not be remiss
---
The concrete numbers have been charged today..down to 15 million now from 150 million hahaha..it's bullshit..what are they gonna do if you don't deposit...not open the BOS? .. ,They'll change the numbers of course they have no choice..things nerffed from the beginning..no biggie just not thought through and fyi l fucking love this game...I have Fallout 1st and pretty large deposits of everything..for comparison  around 4000 lead, 2000 acid, 30,000 steel , 6000 concrete, and in all that I have around 500 cork ...fuck giving up half that for a bollox hat and stand lol..
---
Great tips, thanks! just waiting whether or not the Event will instantly fade is a great idea
---
Except that that makes you a really sh#$ teammate.
---
What's the market sub? fo76marketplace?
---
Same here. Years of playing first person shooters has learned me to never stand still while shooting so it will never kick in for me. Sprinting I seldom do unless on my shotgun char.
---
Nah that one dead.  We can't say it here if you go in my post history you'll find it
---
Cups, lids, and pizza boxes all count as cloth.
---
Hey I don't kink shame - you do you.
---
All I need is a few assaultrons, some peanut butter, and some fastnacht music set on repeat...
---
I haven't used them recently myself so I wasn't too sure but from what I've heard, definitely.
---
One suggestion I have seen to buff them was adding a perk which allows dual-wielding, what do you think of it?
---
X button is too much for some
---
Also, Make it so Blackeye doesnt fucking go to sleep. Im so tired of having to talk to her 19 times before she finally stands her ass up and is able to be actually talked to.
---
Got it, thanks dude
---
Are you trying to buy from a vendor, or a player?  If it's a player, (depending on system) see if they'd be willing to work out a trade. If it's a vendor, see how high you can get your charisma, grape mentats, and hard bargain (I know it caps at a certain point, but I don't know where you are in relation to that cap). Also, I earn a lot of caps by doing dailies and events (monster mash is a good one for caps) that's all I've got.
---
Let me give you my price guide that I use on PS4.
---
- Recipe Plans? All 25 Caps each (Cranberry Relish etc)
---
- Rare Recipe Plans like liquor and Medicine? All 300 Caps (Mentats/Whiskey)
---
- C.A.M.P. item Plans? All 100 Caps 
---
- Specific Armor Mod? All 50 Caps (Ultra Light Raider Armor Torso etc)
---
- Armor Plans? All 100 Caps (Metal Armor Arms etc) unless it's a rare plan
---
- Specific Weapon Mods? All 50 Caps (Prime Pipe Pistol Receiver etc)
---
- Weapon Plans? It varies based on the rarity of said plans
---
- Ultracite Plans you get from Scorchbeast Queen? All 100 Caps
---
- Power Armor Plans? It varies based on the rarity of said plans
---
- Specific Power Armor Mod Plans? It varies based on the rarity of said plans
---
- Legendary Armor? Unless it's a God/Good roll all on sale for 300/600/900 Caps depending on how many effects it has
---
- Legendary Weapon? Unless it's a God/Good roll all on sale for 300/600/900 Caps depending on how many effects it has
---
Glamour Pieces? Unless it's an extremely rare glamour all on sale for 25 caps
---
You **DON'T** put Mounted Head, Revolver Ivory Grip Plans or useless Armor and Weapons for sale.
---
Damn I was hoping for completely new weapons :/ cursed weapons are good n stuff but getting it on a decent weapon with decent legendary effects is gonna be a p.i.t.a. ...
---
Tbh, 90% of random teammates are. Still better then someone who is trying to steal stuff you are about trading with your friends, last time someone stole us a scout armor while he had a marine equipped letting one of us fight without armor. Guess who died instantly and geared up the enemy team?
---
I mean he makes some pretty badass berets so either way I‚Äôm down with it. Lol
---
Yeah it's a bit unfortunate to be forced to use a whole different weapon type but at least it's not too hard to do so
---
I tested it before. Says my gun should sell for 2000-3000, didn't sell for 500, after a week I just put it in the machine.
---
I meant that hence the (with public group buff etc) in my comment. I meant solo in terms of not relying on a higher level friend to kill all once you‚Äôve tagged.
---
I'm in my mums car...vroom vroom
---
Can you give a source? And I am not sure who you mean by "they" I assume bethesda employees?
---
The only time the blast your face off thing happens is when you side with wayward and not the raiders although there is an ending where you get both wayward and raiders to like you
---
Won‚Äôt the mutation go once I use like a radaway or something?
---
We paid no money for them but even if we did they would be better value than 1st. As I told Bethesda when I was banned. Shortly before I was unbanned. With all my dupes intact.
---
He's trying to get sober: that's why he's giving away his booze. lol
---
Also this is the 3rd day in a row both me and my buddy have been attacked by people at the concrete extraction workshops. 
---
Sometimes they do it to take our concrete but there's been a few that just keep killing us and not finishing claiming the shop to just keep killing us from a hidden bush, one shot
---
Sorry but bos are just fancier raiders to me.
---
Im here to play, Explore and have fun, not be a backer to a kickstarter.
---
I'm sure they will start selling lunchbox's in the Atom shop. they are just softening us up.
---
No one would do it because The Enclave are the best faction in the game
---
*slow clap*
---
Now that finally someome mentioned it, this will all happen next week.
---
Its not the fact that we rant about all this since early beta.
---
Workaround : spawn points work how they do now for everybody but you, you place only your spawn point.
---
Concrete scrap can be harvested from¬†[concrete deposits](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Resource_deposits#Concrete_deposits)¬†which can be found at various workshops. A¬†[mineral extractor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mineral_extractor)¬†can be placed on top of a deposit to increase its yield.
---
Three at the¬†[abandoned bog town](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Abandoned_bog_town).
---
One at¬†[Dabney homestead](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Dabney_homestead).
---
One at¬†[Gorge junkyard](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gorge_junkyard).
---
One at¬†[Poseidon Energy Plant yard](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Poseidon_Energy_Plant_yard).
---
One at¬†[Sunshine Meadows industrial farm](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sunshine_Meadows_industrial_farm).
---
Generators generate about 25 scraps an hour so you're looking at around 175 an hour on a private server.
---
Unless I'm missing something?
---
Im looking forward to something new opening up , always am, love this game, yeah it's easy to moan and shit on, I do it myself..but damn when it's working as intended it's fucking brilliant..but they've nurfed the deposit numbers.. they'll change them all when they see no real response, They'll have too..or what, they're not gonna run it as punishment hahaha..who wants to give up hours of grind for a crappy hat and stand
---
&gt; I havnt donated once on any toon 
---
And I don't give a fuck.  There were plenty of people like you during the steel gathering mission but we still got it done.  So the problem is not people like you who are not donating. The problem is that there isn't enough concrete in the map.
---
Either it was on pts or he is using a cheat tool. The plan was never released yet.
---
Now it worked!?!  I changed nothing since I first posted. Secserv Armor did not show up, now it does.
---
Only in nuclear winter
---
What did I just read....I think I may donate now!
---
If you d on't donate concrete, you are letting down yourself, your comrades (other vault dwellers), and the brotherhood of steel. Furthermore, you will be contributing to the failure of the brotherhood of steel to wipe out the scourge infestation which means that you will also be letting down the world and all of humanity. Finally, because God had intended for humanity to survive, you would also be letting him down as well. 
---
So do the right thing, buy some overpriced concrete from my vendor and contribute your fair share to the brotherhood of steel.
---
Um, disregard last comment, brought f1rst and a bunch of cosmestics.
---
I've gotten the cosmetic fever. Nice walls, Nice floors.
---
Your funny its not people that aren‚Äôt participating like when they didn‚Äôt participate in the first part. No need to be a dick because you have an opinion thats not widely shared.
---
Sorry man but you might have to uninstall and reinstall it. Have you made sure to check you‚Äôre up to date with all the updates?
---
LooL, when we dont reach this goal? What then? People wont do more then week one (if even that much), gg bg
---
Honestly, there's no great loss.  
---
Diminishing returns means you will only be a few measly percent worst off than people decked out in full SS. Realistically, I only see SS armor as being superior than normal armor if it has an equal or better roll, and the difference is marginal. It's not like you can freely walk through a nuke zone with the Rad Resist anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You may as well go and get yourself infected by the scorched now.
---
I know it's for pc, and the prices are totally different. But it's all I have (or had) üòÖ I think that what the others have said might be in the right ballpark, so -20% it is
---
The meta would suck a lot less if people would just nut up and do it.  These toxic salty food builds would have you believe pvp is of the devil
---
Oh lord. Ok I'll try looking for concrete üòÇ
---
Get out me car!
---
Armor doesn't sell anymore, apart from a few unyelding pieces. The SS armor ruined it.
---
Yeah jokes aside it‚Äôs almost a guarantee it‚Äôll be the same loot pool plus 4 or so new plans. Everything else will be exactly the same
---
And make an ‚Äúoutfits‚Äù tab instead of lumping in all the pretty dresses as ‚Äúarmor‚Äù while you‚Äôre at it please
---
Ah, my rival. Archibald scrachybottom. How are you old friend?
---
Sounds like it can't get to the servers...
---
Treasury Bonds are just an extension on gold...
---
That's a good point, it is good for finding the trade only weapons.
---
What platform do you play on? I‚Äôve a bunch of plans I can give you to help with impressions.
---
Yeah I donated about the same steel but I have only like 100 concrete in my stash and all the locations where there‚Äôs lots of concrete have been picked clean!
---
The very first time I tried Scorched Earth was back in May of 2019. 
---
In hindsight, it was a suicide mission from the start as the server was by and large mostly newbies around level 30. 
---
I was on my level 70 and figured I was finally powerful enough to attempt the 'endgame'...
---
I had roughly 6000 rounds for my .50, which wasn't even a legendary and no PA.
---
So I zone there being 100% clueless on what to expect, just hoping to follow the veterans lead only to discover that *I'm* the highest level present... 'Gulp'.
---
So we proceeded to chase and shoot, chase and shoot, die from the spawns because we're tunnel vision focused on the sky. Respawn and rinse and repeat. The 8 or so players around me just running around clueless and continuously firing in all directions. 
---
10 minutes in and I'm nearly out of radaway, as I don't even have a hazmat suit. A few minutes after that I'm out of stimpacks.
---
At this point I realize the queen hasn't even been scratched yet, or so it seems. We're all unloading everything we've got but she just laughs it off. Even when she lands we all just keep pew pewing away to no avail. 
---
I watch as the event timer ticks away to zero, we fail. Still she's on us so we're all still firing like mad.
---
Then it happened, for the first time in 70 levels of play I ran out of ammo! All I had left was a combat rifle I'd picked up off a spawn. So I'm plinking away at her slowly, her health still not budging. 
---
I notice that most of the players had left, with only a few still chasing after her. I stood there just kind of shook, I was out of ammo, weapons of the verge of breaking. My rads were so high my health alarm was going non stop but I had no radaway. I'd lost anything I managed to grab with the frequent deaths... and it was all for nothing! All that ammo, the chems and time was just gone in a poof with nothing to show for it.
---
I stood there with her still screaming and felt defeated. 
---
Then a group of 4 'god mode' players appeared. They were all above level 200 and in sleek PA's. It was like watching a band of superheroes teleport in to save the day. 
---
In unison they raised their heavy weapons to the sky and melted her in a fiery blast of laser lights. My jaw literally dropped from the spectacle. Here we were literally giving everything we had and not even scratching her and they just swatted her away like a gnat! 
---
I picked up my measly 1 star reward, something useless to me and dragged myself back to camp. Opening my stash to retrieve my 'emergency' stash of ammo only to find out I'd inadvertantly grabbed it at some point so now I was 100% out. 
---
I go to craft some ammo only to learn I'm out of both lead and steel...
---
That was it for me. I'd played for 5 months, 6 hours a day, but that was the moment I burned out. I just didn't have it in me to grind out more ammo. Didn't have it in me to min/max my way into a viable build. Feeling more powerless than I did when I exited the vault I packed it up. 
---
I took a year off and came back last month. 2nd time through I made much better choices perk wise, held onto my scrip til level 50 instead of spending it the moment I got it regardless of level or need and even lucked into grabbing a level 45 explosive handmade!
---
So last week, when I stepped into my fully modded Ultracite PA and stood face to face with the queen once more I was rather overjoyed to see her health dwindling quick to my exploding rounds! Having her land right in front of me only to get bashed in the head with my 2 star super sledge and then fall dead was icing on the cake! I felt like the Dovakin of Appalachia!
---
Wait how do you know :0
---
No
---
Nah the complains are for frog legs in general as they make everyone almost impossible to hit till he jumps. 
---
I'd never say camping is bad in BR. The difference between sniping from a bush or a tree is minimal.
---
That seems to be about right. All the other stuff is much easier to price. And dump (lookin at you mounted faschnacht crap).
---
The one currently in game only drops one star nocturnal shovels for me, the upcoming one is supposed to drop three star shovels.
---
Obviously done to keep people subbed.
---
Check firewall settings. On my pc prior to signing in sometimes mcafee pops up a message ‚Äúallow fo76 access to internet‚Äù. I must hit allow for sign in to occur
---
This would be as much of a problem if they let us trade them and not just scrip/destroy them
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs slim pickings. I have no idea how they thought this target could be met. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt know the resources of their own game items.
---
Atlas is a superweapon. like the weather dominator from GI joe or the death star.
---
Assuming you don‚Äôt have the grounded mutation and use the gauss rifle in a longer range sniping role, the damage per shot is top tier.  With maxed adrenaline and 3.75x sneak damage, a bloody/+10% version can kill a Sheepsquatch with one head shot.
---
That being said, I greatly prefer a lever gun for a long range option.  It‚Äôs much more nimble and versatile.  In VATS, the gauss is fussy.  In free aim, you can‚Äôt easily cancel a charged shot.  The recoil is pretty heavy while aiming down sights, and the gun is fairly bulky in first person view.  2mm ammo is also fairly heavy compared to .45.
---
Same. And the price it sometimes gives for a weapon is like 2000-4000 caps, or 30000, or trade only...
---
This is my favorite glitch in the whole game, the radiation is creating a new breed of mutant wendigos lol
---
I'm sad because of this! I have many nice armor pieces just sitting there that no one wants to buy.
---
You can craft ledger and then destroy it, to climb on trees
---
That can only shoot upwards at varying angles? Lol
---
They realised their mistake in estimating materials able to be gathered and fixed it... What were they supposed to do? Let it fail and just ignore their community? What kind of game do you want this to be?
---
No, it literally is just the weather dominator from GI joe, i don't know why i thought saying it was like the death star made sense. It controls the weather.
---
I launched my first nuke onto a crowded faschnacht. 2 people stayed in the zone not knowing what is happening. It was funny.
---
Bottom line is, you launch the nuke. You decide where it goes.
---
Agreed. it's a slog. They probably aren't going to change it because it keeps us grinding.
---
Now that‚Äôs an idea to get behind. I sell a fair number but accumulate far more that I just end up dumping more into random containers near stations or at the initial overseer‚Äôs camp. But does it have to be for caps? Maybe it could be for something else? Maybe points toward some sort special mission or intel to pre-war loot?? I know caps are the go-to but honestly once you get to level 50-70 and have settled into how you want your character built or kitted out like you want and usually caps aren‚Äôt an issue anymore. At my level (452 as of yesterday on my main or 254 on my alt) caps are one of the last thing I want or need. But I do live for rare plans or loot...
---
How are you seeing these numbers?
---
I sneak and use vats, so sprinting isnt an option as I use those Vats points. Sneaking clearly means no standing, so that's out. I just couldn't do it.
---
I just updated, maybe it will help:/
---
\^ THIS
---
Good idea I‚Äôll try that
---
Yes, however Demolition Expert does not.
---
That would be your issue then. Any sort of skin will prevent items from being scripted/ traded/ sold to vendors. Youll need to take it to a a armorbench and remove it. Then it will be able to be turned in.
---
Yeah... so I just wasted 20$ ?
---
For 145 million concrete, they better bring Hoover fuckin' Dam from the Mojave.
---
I don't know why you are getting downvoted. You made a good point.
---
Spoken like a true Commie.
---
So check why, AV, firewalls that kind of stuff...
---
 Yeah I'd say you are missing something.    175 an hour is a complete joke.    With steel you could get double or quadruple that much in less than half the amount of time.   And without having to take a single workshop.
---
I carry a Gauss Minigun and Gatling Gun for this reason.  5mm is resource cheap, so that‚Äôs the everyday weapon.  I use the Gauss Minigun for tougher stuff.  I honestly don‚Äôt know how I would supply the Gauss Minigun if it was my sole weapon.
---
You'll have done the right thing.  Furthermore I'll be coming up with a million and one clever ways to murder anyone trying to give them my plastic.  Don't support the #brotherswhosteal.  I guarantee you'll get your little flag or whatever anyways.  I gave em nothing for the stupid hat I'll never wear.
---
I think this was my problem, not skins.  I added buttressed.
---
The plans at vendors will always be there mate
---
It's endgame, I have now rolled full sets of Vanguard, Unyielding and Bolstering SS and also solar armour...took a shit tonne of leg modules and vault stee etcl, but, not like we have much else to do ..... :-)
---
That was a great story and a good read, thanks for that! And given that whole backstory I see why you'd want it to die as soon as possible but I'd still appreciate letting it land as it definitely also conserves ammo for all ranged users. And I also know that "Dovakin of Appalachia" feel you talk about, it's amazing to have that huge beast drop onto you when smashing it in melee, I use unarmed so I just keep smashing her chin until she falls to the ground eventually, just kind of hard to stay on top of all the enemys she can spawn if you are so focused on breaking her jaw.
---
&gt;Technically they didn't?
---
I'm not bothered about "technically" though.  They fudged it at the other end than people were expecting, and they fudged it in a more believable and transparent way, but they still fudged it.
---
So using demo expert on this gun is just a waste of perk space?
---
They should have made special events for gathering the needed mats. An event that rewarded the players with a buttload of concrete, and normal event drops like legendaries, or scrip, might actually make it fun and worthwhile.
---
Happens with other cooking stations as well. Discovered it myself the other day when I went to use someones stove. Ran around the nearby station at the speed of light while chopping meat.
---
Commie or capitalist? I am trying to turn a profit on my concrete sales....
---
And please, level 200‚Äôs, stop selling all of the ultracite and prime plans for 250 caps each when you‚Äôve got 14 of each of them. Everyone knows they‚Äôre duped and no ones paying that much
---
Damn im a compulsive hoarder in This game. I pick up Everything like a vacume and still i Only get like 1-1,5 k concrete a day. Don't have time to server hop just for that.
---
Rule 10.
---
I mean you can use gunsmith V instead. Without it this gun breaks fast
---
Don't be hyped for your own sake.
---
Oh sorry, wrong fallout thread, will delete
---
One of my all time favorites.  It's worth sticking at it.  If you get a companion, you should be fine.
---
I don‚Äôt go to bases with lots of plans , if they still sell plans they usually have nothing of value I‚Äôd be interested in
---
In my opinion it‚Äôs still too little because if 1 dollar is roughly 100 atoms and for one hour of work you can earn 15 dollars minimum wage which is 1500 atoms we should be getting 114,000 atoms for 7,600 hours but obviously that won‚Äôt happen so...
---
Sweet! Hopefully Cork will be 1M üëçüèº... please
---
&gt; and i‚Äôm gliding around playing the banjo shooting bullets out my ass. 
---
Yup, Taco night will do that to you.
---
SS did use it. I built my whole life around selling armors. Had 60 3* at all times and sold 20k a day easy.  Now I sell one armor a week for 1-2k caps.  Weapons are selling like crazy now however. Price is what u want. Put for as high as u want and then price it down.  U will start to catch on to what ppl want because the very first person will buy at a stupid high price right after u put it on sale. It takes practice and a lot of trial and error to get prices perfect.  Subs won‚Äôt help imo. You must test and see what the sales are like. Or maybe u just have a garbage inventory.
---
Yes please people try to meet this goal it‚Äôs one of the only ones worth it
---
Yeah, best of luck to you bro!
---
Ikr? At least once a day I find a bag with tens of each of ultracite, prime and mounted head plans dumped on a train statior or rusty pick...
---
That's the actual quest, it's all just been a cover up for an Enclave dlc. We have to help the Enclave stop the Brotherhood from taking all of Appalachias tech
---
Jetpack. It'll change your life.
---
Its not the requirements didnt you read this thread?!? Its the lack of worthy rewards. The shit is either a item we already have with a new patch or a cheap banner/hat/flag, its junk and not worth the effort.
---
While I think Fed76 is a noble effort, I think it fails to accurately reflect the fluidity of the game‚Äôs market and various aspects of the actual trade economy.  From my perspective as a long time high level player, Fed76 cannot accurately value truly desirable gear, and hilariously inflates the prices on stuff I‚Äôd consider more valuable in the form of 15-40 scrip.
---
Again, I applaud the effort, but I think it‚Äôs ultimately a doomed endeavor because of the fluid nature of the game.
---
You know what I‚Äôd rather have? Survival mode back.
---
I don't give a shit about BOS. i exist only for the Mothman Cult. All hail the Mothman!
---
Cus you should be doing pvp
---
Just the normal hit-marker damage numbers, why do you ask?
---
Everyone says it's the best one. Guess I'll give 'er a go!
---
Profits are not allowed comrade
---
Should be max 1.5 months or so if you begin from 0, most likely less as even the beginning quest lines seem to raise the rep to 1-2 out of 4 stages...
---
Jetpack.
---
Use the extra days to build up legendary modules, it'll take awhile irregardless to get the roles you want. The jetpack will be more fun in the meantime while saving up for the final leg.
---
Good tip. I did not know this
---
Because I've never seen damage numbers period with or without vats. 
---
I'm speculating it's a PC mod perhaps? Or some hidden setting I'd need to turn on like pacifist?
---
I've punched them in the face and walked away laughing. But if I sneak up on one of those bears I run away. Man those bears scares me, if they get the 1st hit in they stagger you again and again.
---
Chem station logout broke my pipboy but worth the animation and gliding
---
I understand BUCS\_LIFE and know what can be used to manipulate them to contributing...
---
Free Chickens with every donation of concrete!
---
They did this same style event before with cleaning appalachia. Its not a new style of event but this time its junk and cost us more than some bullets which means the rewards should have been way beter than the first event.
---
This is the most capital "G" Gamer‚Ñ¢ comment I've read in a little while
---
English ain‚Äôt my first language it‚Äôs my third so colossal was misspelled due to being in a rush
---
It can certainly be a good thing if executed well but remember we've had many instances where the final result was far from the potential pitched to us e.g. The Burrows, Vault raids, Legendary Run for some people etc.
---
Not looking to be a downer. Just suggesting that you temper your expectations a little.
---
Well played Comrade.
---
Yeah might be pts
---
It's definitely a pyramid scheme.
---
I don't know if you need to turn it on, they've always been there for me playing on pc, didn't know they were special, I'll boot up the game and check setting right now
---
This reminds me of the TNG episode "The Game" with that disk+vortex game. Even if Wesley refused to move the disk, the vortex had eventually come for it so they are hooked either way.
---
Most likely pts he don‚Äôt cheat
---
Buttressed won't be an issue. The purchased camo skin mod will be. In your stash it will have an atom logo next to it
---
Is it a Dupe trap :)
---
Got it, just what i was looking for!
---
Yes laser only goes flesh deep, but words can cut into you soul.
---
As I said in my previous comment, I just booted up the game, the setting "Show Damage Numbers (Adventure)" is found towards the bottom of the display tab
---
You could in theory also farm lead pipes. The yield 1 concrete each :)
---
Know what you mean. For my current unyielding secret service, it took 3 for chest (1*), 6 for Left Arm (didn't even get Unyielding but Bolstering with 50% fall damage), 15 for Right Arm (2* with +1C) and 3 for Left Leg (1* again).
---
Most will have to be re-rolled in the future for 2* or 3* variants so I'm sure I'll enjoy that.
---
So I feel like constantly setting up camp helps with getting all my junk off of me so I'm not carrying so much stuff. What's the alternative if you don't really want a "mobile" camp?
---
Pts is offline for 2weeks now.
---
&gt;how badly the player community failed
---
Yes, in the same way that you will "badly fail" when I challenge you to fly to the sun and back.  It was a ridiculously stupid request, the player community has nothing to answer for here.
---
As bait. Get them to come out and get set up, then nuke them.
---
Indeed! Just found it! I must've turned it off a year and half ago when I first started playing and forgot all about it. Thanks.
---
Treasure Hunter is still on my shit list.
---
Yeah it was a while ago I know that rifle gaming showed a video on how to get the unique rewards and he killed the unique collasaul that is in a mine that you have to nuke to go in
---
I haven't even been back there since the steel because I couldn't be bothered for the shit rewards. Might check it out.
---
Yeah those legendaries are not going to get you 6k
---
From the information provided at QuakeCon, the devs inferred that new gear is on the horizon with upcoming BoS content, but it was a vague, somewhat offhanded comment.  No one outside BGS Austin knows what‚Äôs being planned.
---
oops expeditions delayed in 10 years
---
Glad to help! Hope it can make troubleshooting your damage problems that much easier, definitely did help me not get frustrated, as it clearly showed what damage I was doing and I could figure out why it was dropping
---
As they were duped i sell mine for 19 caps a pop, been going really fast since i lowered it from 100, can't wait to get rid of those completely. I threw all my mounted plans a while a go. except Mothman, Deathclaw and rad stag, still sell those for 19 caps
---
I spawn in all over the godamn are of my camp..on the roof, in the walls,on my balcony,  200 meters away, on top of my water purifier, even once in the sky and then fell hahaha it keeps it interesting lol
---
I'd go the last armour piece. Jetpacks are fun and can have some utility but you also lose the DR and the admittedly low probability of getting left leg legendary from rewards or purveyor.
---
Why bloodied are undisputed dmg kings, there are actually several reasons why not use the build.
---
\- PvP (dmg cap + susceptibility to rad and poison dmg)
---
\- finicky to mantain that holy 19% HP mark
---
\- expensive to gear up (good luck trading for BSSs, BEs and Unys)
---
But yeah, it's still go-to PVE and leveling build.
---
what???? That sucks ! I‚Äôve been having rank 5
---
I see that you're a side saddle driver. Nice :)
---
Oh no. If only someone had seen this coming.
---
Demo expert does apply to an explosive gp. It just does not show on the pip boy. With damage numbers on you will see the difference
---
It does work. Just does not show on the pip boy. Turn in damage numbers and you'll see the difference
---
Yeah, i would have loved to see the rise of the free states a long with the Responders. Nice story of them coming back, with twists in the story, in this imaginary story things take a twisted turn, m,aking the responders side with the raiders and Free states with foundation.   
---
But seriously my two favorite factions of fallout atm are the free states and the responders
---
It does work. Just does not show on the pip boy. Turn on damage numbers and you'll see the difference
---
Well yeah I was only talking about PvE, I should've specified, as it really is awful for PvP du to the damage cap, you simply don't need the damage you do.
---
As to expensive gear, I can partially agree but I do have a character which is bloodied and I got decent bloodied weapons as well as an almost full set of unyielding SS armor in about a week so it didn't seem bad but I might just be lucky. In general I would stick to the bullion weapons though as they are much easier to roll and not nearly as expensive as player trades, besides non-bloodied weapons also being viable and still doing more damage than with alternative builds, especially the melee ones.
---
Here is my short video clip.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sH8xwbJZvw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sH8xwbJZvw)   
---
One way to fix it to try and change your wall to different type and hope that now it show correctly and change back to you original wall and wallpaper.
---
Tell that to my fucking airship
---
Probably damage overflow.  It's likely not intentional and should definitely be fixed.
---
If  you do the mainquestline you get a lot of rep for them of you choose them of split the buillion. But it doe sure wouldnt take 6 months. 
---
Just to be sure you are doing the importance of communication or retirement plan ones?? Oh and you can do photo opportunity for some extra (choose to take pics of the foundation and give them to the raiders and dont accept their caps)
---
Daily Ops were confirmed to be the vault raids not the expeditions
---
Agreed, it's a rare commodity there was no way we could collect enough to donate the amount asked for.  
---
I think abandoned bog town has three concrete nodes and they only produce 120 concrete in 73 minutes. and whenever I take the workshop I always have to fight 3 scorch beasts for the defend event so it's not easy to defend.   
---
I have FO1st and only have 444 concrete in my scrap box I love building so there's no way I'm giving the BOS 250 of it.
---
Ultracite plans are not duped, they are common loot from the SBQ. So everyone who frequently fight Her Ugly Majesty has them a lot, sometimes you can find them being discarded after fight.
---
Like a month or 2.not 6
---
The craft of the secret service armor is always legendary but you need to buy legendary modules (50 Scrip each).
---
I can confirm that the camp object is tied to your spawnpoint, try to check which direction from your C.A.M.P object you spawn (for example north) then you can move it to the south side of your camp to spawn deeper inside the build are, the confusing thing is that rotating doesn't change the spawn direction, as it is set when placing down the camp initially
---
You're right you can't, because you're still using bloodied to hit harder than a full health junkies build could.
---
You can assist each faction In random battles you encounter, just make sure you go and talk to them after the fight is over, one of them will.award you reputation.
---
Man a month or two ago, I had this level 3 join my team and I was like "he might just want help leveling up" but time and time again, he would request to trade and request the same exact piece of armor. That armor was my first legendary piece that I used and was level 50. I don't know if they knew that they'd have to level up 47 times to make use of it and it would just take up stash space. After emoting no many times, he still kept trying but then ended up leaving the team. It was a really weird experience haha.
---
I‚Äôm sure they also drop from the duped handmade gifts
---
Poison damage probably kills you "immediately".
---
You get knocked almost all the time, but without poison resistance a single tick will kill you instantly. So technically you get knocked by a ghoul, cricket or anything else but you won't even see the knock state since you'll die ASAP the first tick hits.
---
As far I know only a nuke and rads kill you instantly.
---
the secret service armor is good tho isnt it? Im farming for that one
---
Really, does it improve stamina? If i Get Ap refresh can i finally last longer then 5 min in "fights" with the wife?
---
...a tiny bit.
---
Check the meat bags at the general steak house and huntersville, bloodbug meat is very often in there
---
One of us
---
Only if it's only shown for the player that has it equipt. Or else why not go all the way, how about a cartoonish boing sound to go with it. His is an amusement park and not a nuclear wast land after all.
---
Yeah I'm sure it's a bug, but people are used to it now. I think we need this to be cleared up though.
---
u/ladydevann can you find out for us? And see if there's any way to fix this?
---
It would make team play much better of we were able to revive each other more consistently.
---
You cant join them, but they are in the game !
---
Ah, nice to know
---
When you dont plan to play every day for 6 months, there are glitches for raiders and foundation reputation. Some cut horrible grind and some can do in hours. You have multiple options. Last two reputations ranks took huge amount of time.
---
Yes, nowhere near enough in my opinion.
---
I'd be happy with this if they would buy plans even at a flat 1% of face value. I like doing plan dumps for lower level characters, but I get sick of having wasted inventory space and making my inventory UI laggy just to save them up for it.
---
If your rep is in the 'Neighborly' state, it is a complete and utter grind to get to 'Ally' just keep slogging thru' and eventually it clicks over, the last few times are REALLY annoying, as there's just a sliver of reputation left, and it feels like you don't move even one pixel closer each time.
---
For the love of GOD, please don¬¥t make it the same. Quickly, assign a team now to make something great and not mounted plans, i literally will throw my self of Seneca rocks if i get another mounted plan.
---
In some servers yes, just server jump and it should be fine. It's probably due to dying/long running servers. It's a long-term issue honestly.
---
Jetpack. Because I saw someone flying with the Sorchbeast Queen
---
I would be nice if new stuff where added to the presents but it's not like Bethesda has to do it .. the content of the presents was fine until it was duped a million times.. so big thanks to the few that changed the game for us all...
---
Why don¬¥t you think so? Your argument has the substance of a fart
---
I wear the Asylum Uniform (Forest atm) so watching a male nurse flying with the SBQ would be an interesting sight.... Hmmmmmmmmmm
---
no! Sunny is the best Sunny
---
The BOS doesn‚Äôt even know this is going on, it‚Äôs just some random BOS fanboy who wants to help them
---
The minimum wage in america is 7.25$, so under half of what you are claiming but I do agree that the atom reward is ridiculously small
---
yeah. beth really doesn't respect their players, or their time.
---
The enclave isn't even at war with the brotherhood yet so this dowsn't make any sence
---
You've probably found it by now but if not. I screengrabbed my map. Where my survival tent &amp; cursor/arrow is, is the location of the greenhouse/farm place with the fertilizer bags. Look in ALL the surround sheds etc it lurks all over the place. Hope that helps
---

---
It's kinda sad cause you need to 'beef up' your map marker to make yourself appear more desirable for a shopping visit, but in truth that means you need to have a lot of crap on sale, unless you've spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours in the game.
---
I tend to only sell things I feel might actually get sold. My camp is quite out of the way, so I don't get many low-level players visiting, so I won't even bother selling most CAMP items, instead I carry them around and give them to some new folks, preferably people who don't seem to have a lot of plans, but have a hankering for building.
---
As you've mentioned, pushing the camp one way gives you deeper into the centre. What about pushing the other way. Can you spawn outside the camp radius?
---
I get that there is SOME association with camp item and spawn points but I've been in situations where it would spawn consistently in one spot for a while and then suddenly for a while that spawn shift. No reason at all. Nothing obstructing that spot, nothing in the camp changed. Zero reason for it. That's why it feels so random to me because there is nothing consistent that I can see about it.
---
go for leg when you have resources to craft a lot of them to get correct legendary effect
---
go for jetpack when you have a lot of AP and AP regen. Because without it you fly like 1,5seconds. Its nice for exploring but thats it.
---
Yeah I know. I presume you were talking about the plan and I was more referencing the recent changes to legendary reward pool.
---
Seriously hope this is a thing. My CAMP is on the edge of the map and 90% of the time I'm spawned outside the map borders and can't move and have to fast travel to my base a second time to land within the game borders.
---
You should be able to have it shift outside of the camp radius, though I can't be sure in your case might be something with your location. I used to have a set spawn in a puddle near my camp which didn't move for a long time, the rads and swimming started to annoy me so I moved it and so did the spawn point, hasn't moved more since, so no real inconsistencies for me. build objects didn't seem to affect it either as the game had no problem spawning me inside of a generator where I couldn't get out of naturally
---
So is launching a nuke at the imposter doing it the right way, cause if it is I do that all the time :)
---
also my experience
---
Molerats!
---
&gt;exact opposite
---
Ironically, you appear to have mis-spelled "effectively exactly identical".
---
It seems to me like the armor displays will come with, but may only be usable in there for "stability" reasons as has been claimed so many times before.
---
I for one won't be holding my breath for these instanced interiors. Seems like more of a distraction.
---
Settler 2 of pregrabbing wards items and server hopping at reset time works aswell still st least on ps4
---
They changed it
---
thats exactly where i am lol, the bar is about half full and after the last two days the bar isnt even noticably moved. Also, is there a set time the dailys reset?
---
Yeah I just learned that from another comment. For some reason I thought server hopping didn‚Äôt change inventory but I was wrong. Just started like a month ago so I didn‚Äôt even bother trying myself
---
Generally if they have 40+ plans, or a decent amount of guns and armor. I'm still missing dome plans and no where close to being geared how I want
---
I wonder why lol
---
Yeah I figured but thought I‚Äôd try to put them out there
---
Ahhh right, sorry I misunderstood your comment.
---
See I use to think that and there are some plans that never seem to sell but I've also been quite surprised what plans sell and don't sell.
---
Yeah, it might be inconvenient for you but it likely means that you're not the target market.
---
Tadpole tokens, Possum tokens, Overseer tokens.
---
Not if you‚Äôre capable of putting out 20k+ damage a hit :D
---
The Brahmin are okay. The mutation is not damaging friendly creatures anymore. I think the disease cure has a chance to cure a disease. I stopped using this mutation because the ghouls at Radiation Rumble are chasing me when I'm collecting ores.
---
They changed the total, it's in a news point at the top of this sub-reddit
---
Am o missing something? This is the second post about a BoS event requiring material donations but I have no idea what it is?
---
The brotherhood need cork. Do not question their idiocy and scams and REBUILD AMERICA WITH THE ENCLAVE
---
Dose any 1 have flux forsale and or ultracite ammo or neuk key cards cheers
---
What doesn‚Äôt?
---
see? the devs are playing it on livestream haha
---
Well not yet, but you can kinda see some friction developing....
---
Fall out 1st in general is so fucking stupid and clearly them just trying to milk out more money
---
Hi
---
I don‚Äôt find it difficult on my PvP or melee character because I can out DPS them on both. I can also outheal their damage with Nuka Cola Quantum. Grape and orange work well too.
---
Is it Xbox?  if so, check your gold subscription. This happens when your sub expires.

That line makes me laugh everytime I hear it üòÇ

Start at [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) and try not to let the poorly designed web-app drive you insane before you've submitted the bug report.
---
It's about 8pm eastern. 
---
I know what you mean by it barely moves. I took sxreen shots before and after turning in my daily to see if it did.
---
Probably not until next year at this rate. Legendary players was slated for summer last year.
---
The garb of mysteries kinda hides it with the sleeves. I just got the Mr. Fuzzy costume and I couldn't help putting it on her, cracks me up seeing Mr. Fuzzy playing guitar.
---
Your best bet is jumping around player camps, I got them for the tadpole challenge that way, some people sell them extremely cheaply so just look out for them
---
Somebody only played half of fallout 3 ü§îüòÇüòÇ
---
Have you played 3? You're kinda forced in that one to at least interact and do their bidding
---
Patch 22 is Sep
---
It's a quest not opening presents. I made the same mistake.
---
The fact that Morgantown airport has the small backpack plan in an overseer cache on the 2nd floor now
---
How about you check the other 20 threads on the topic.
---
Ok, my bad, somehow didnt see it
---
Yes but legendary players was announced LAST year before summer. We've waited over a year for this.
---
The forklift-like robots weren't there before, and you can really notice that the areas around the donation boxes have been built up.
---
I would say it took me 7 weeks or so. I did both quest lines up until I had to choose sides and had fair amount of rep with both factions from that. I kept all the gold and dropped a little rep as a result. I sided raider and did both raider and settler dailies and had max raider rep around 7 weeks. Took another 2 weeks to finish the settler rep. For what it‚Äôs worth there was maybe 1 day per week where I wasn‚Äôt able to play so that lengthened the process.
---
I know, but you can either guess or use the info we have at hand/were given, I wouldn't go off a guess first :-)
---
Burn! god one, that guy is not getting it, yet insisting all of us don't get it.

Rewards from the community goals are suck. If you like them, well, good for you, but there is a lot of people who don't care about crappy beret, banner or even SCORE bonuses because the already finished the run.
---
 Jesus Fucking Christ why does this still need to be explained to you?
---
Because the BOS that are coming are the scouting party. Not that I want to defend them
---
Nope there is no friction
---
Lol, why?
---
Apparently patch 22 but then again the Colossal Problem was meant to first be released during Patch 20, so who knows really.
---
This. I turned in 18 tickets and was over encumbered with pre war money after about 9 of them.
---
Eh, these guys don‚Äôt know that he didn‚Äôt hoard 40k concrete. He duped it or benefited from
---
Duping of this through a trade etc.
---
Whose agent gray?
---
I mostly have the memory of a goldfish
---
With the right perks and SS armor you won't be less tanky, especially taking legendary effects into account, in addition they aren't needed for high rad areas since radshield stacks on itself so does rad x and the rad reduction nuka-cola, getting these consumables for the rare occasions you need them will give you better value, with maintenance, I really don't think that is much of a factor as it's not to expensive anyway and most people are sitting on repair kits from the queen, the helmet mod can also be replaced by berry mentats, though I agree that it can be useful. The main reason I'd use it is only the stabilized perk but that's kind of sad as it should be the tank option
---
Do you have a source for the damage reduction?
---
You sometimes die instantly during encryptid, and sometimes you get to live to be revived by others. Still didn't figure out this either xD I usually don't die during this event at all, but yesterday had some bad luck and died a few times, 2 times instantly.
---
I just got the last piece of ss armor I needed for my commando build, although I keep the scout armor it replaces because I'm having a hard time losing the acrobats effect. I was going to roll for a gauss minigun on my, until I decided to give him the grounded mutation. He uses power armor mainly, so I don't feel the need to roll ss armor. My third character, I just don't feel like finishing the quest right now, let alone grinding for bullion. My last 2 slots, I'm saving for some RP ideas I have. The thing is, I'm busy with work, so why not just have fun. Rolling as armor wasn't that fun. If there's another COVID shutdown, I might get back into it, but not right now.
---
Lazier than having a BoS scouting party doing it?
---
It's arguably more compelling by using a crazy fanboy.
---
I fear hostile Assaultrons more than Deathclaws. That laser just melts me every time
---
Wow, and we went from 4.6M to like 12M somehow. I'm skeptical since it sat at 4.65M for 3 days before they reset the goal posts and now suddenly people have donated another 8M. I call shenanigans!
---
They're.. not here yet..?
---
Which would be why it's needed..?

---
It will explain for pretty much all the stuff, like what junk you could bulk or not, aid hoarding, etc. Pretty handy imo for your case.
---
Encrypted also delivers a damage over time, tho I don't know which element.
---
Okay
---
I played half of 3 but I didn't like it so I didn't get very far.  I've played 1, 2, NV and 4 though - NV was my favourite although I enjoyed them all.
---
Could be burning then.
---
Yep!! Fallout 3 didn't grab me, I didn't get very far.  I've played 1, 2, NV and 4 though!
---
I started an alt, then realised all the grinding for rep and gold and semi decent armour...yuk, gave in after 2 hrs :-)
---
They reduced it to 15 million.
---
I think they need to add legendary power armor variants or at least add the option to have a storage increase added, having multi-mods (mod, jetpack and backpack) in addition to legendary effects would just make the power armor too good again though in my opinion, they might be able to balance that by giving it unique legendary effects though catered to tanking, heavy guns and fusion core efficiency and making it so "normal" armor effects can't all be applied so each have a niche
---
Example for those: Your fusion core life-time is increased, the durability of your PA is quadrupled, Your PA gives additional 5% dmg reduction (for 30% as a tank build), Your PA increases energy weapon damage (had that in FO4), PA reduces recoil additionally
---
Wasn't fallout liked before because of realism?
---
One step forward &amp; 2 steps back unfortunately. Definitely better then at launch, but still has a lot of issues
---
A big drop will do it too
---
Straight garbage ITV you linked.

This is the one you want.

Well if you are a trader,i suggest you check all vendors that have any weapons. MAny times have i found BE,JE, B25+, J25+ weapons from players that don't know it's worth.  And most often it¬¥s mid level players who only have 2-3 weapons for sale. That¬¥s also how i found the responders firemans outfit for 75 caps.
---
Have you tried rebuilding your PS4 database? My frame rate was dropped severely after the update, especially during an event. Then someone suggested me to rebuild the database.
---
For me I usually ditch bone, wood, and cloth. I bulk them and sell them. I also ditch gunpowder a lot. I find it everywhere and usually end up being able to dump 2/3rds and still have enough to make the ammo I need.
---
What are you looking for in terms of weapons? just curious.
---
&gt;be it hostile
---
Yeah, surely they'd be hostile towards people who built them up a free base.. that they themselves designated via radio.
---
I subbed one month later than my friend and now he has a cool NCR elite ranger amor that I wanted and I only got a slightly different paint on the same standard NCR armor. Some "exclusive" items are a lot better than others.
---
You can box him in. It can escape sometimes but it will return next time the cell loads.
---
Wow, that‚Äôs gorgeous.
---
The scum of PC are the hackers. The scum of console are the Bush pussies. You‚Äôre actually playing the game rather than just hiding away and pretending like you‚Äôre having fun.
---
That sucks if that is the case. Wish there was some small period of invincibility after getting knocked out or DoT status clearing.
---
Did you kill his boyfriend?
---
Not really, the one you linked is out of date and contains now incorrect dates, not sure why you think that's better?
---
it got way better. but everytime they fix something they break something else. There's some problems and flaws that have been in since day one almost and they've not been fixed.
---
BUT i love it T\_T
---
Do you not get the news pop up in game?
---
You're definitely missing something.
---
Not to mention that Todd has no clue what the word "rare" means for the rewards for donating to get to the goal.
---
Legendary players. Summer 2019.
---
I don't want SS armor to be tradable to be honest. Unless it's just between your own characters, account locked, then I'm all in.
---
No..?
---
The radio broadcast quite literally says that's where they are going.
---
That's okay. You don't have to meet her everyday except for daily photo.
---
Whats compelling about a boring NPC with a scrap box?
---
Donating promo is stupid. Beyhsesda can't design shit. They are making people work. How fun!
---
Shit, it would make revenant + 5x LifeSaving way better. I'm running 4x lifesaving at the moment and out of like 20 "downs", about 12 of them are just instakills.
---
Not even from poison all the time, but poison almost always. Wanted to run an immortal berserker build using lifesaving / berserker / revenant / mysterious savior, but it doesn't work if: A) heavy perk survival choices just make you not get downed at all even with no DR and B) You instantly die far more often than being downed.
---
Yes, you are. 
---
You will also like it and do it again when the BOS comes back because Bethesda has no idea how to keep players engaged other than using time gates, caps, limits and a shit RNG.
---
? He wants the new official release date, it's literally what he asked for, you really aren't helping...
---
Top of the world tickets? Are these something I‚Äôm unaware of or are you referring to the pleasant valley claim tickets
---
If you liked fo4, you'll like this. Its better than on release. But still has a long way to go, with bugs from release still present
---
Of course with the right specific criteria, any result is possible. 
---
For example, for like for like base armour with mods only, PA stands out considerably in terms of carry weight vs normal armour.
---
It starts to get nonsensical if you start throwing together every edge case possible. It only really makes sense to talk about the typical case. In those instances, there are pros and cons with either.
---
I'd settle for Abby showing back up so I could give her a hug and tell her it was all worth it lol. She'd be really cool as a camp ally
---
YES!
---
It depends a lot if you have somebody to play with. I am lucky to have at least 1/2 friends who bought the game so no problem, but I guess that without then I wouldn‚Äôt have played 500+ hours
---
I didn‚Äôt see that either. Nice!!
---
To be fair, given the way the BoS tends to operate, they're probably assuming no one still alive is advanced enough to "listen in" on their "secure comms".  
---
And these are supposedly still mostly trained soldiers. Soldiers sent to investigate what happened to another trained group of soldiers.  
---
Say you're leading this group of soldiers and you arrive in Appalachia, and your intended base appears to have been "prepared" for you by someone with an unhealthy obsession for the BoS, along with no sign of those BoS troops you came looking for...  
---
That wouldn't sound fishy to you at all? It's almost textbook Hansel and Gretel for adults!
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more, I scrap like crazy and I was lucky to scrape together 600 cement from my SCRAP. Pretty BS Bethesda event in general, massive chunk of disappointment.
---
Watch out - personal opinion here.
---
____
---
At launch it was okay for a single playthrough.
---
Since wastelanders I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs even good for a single playthrough plus 20-30 hours for exploring and experiencing the different events.
---
For endgame content at release it was just plain
---
Bad.
---
For endgame content after wastelanders it is now already below mediocre.
---
TL;DR: for that price just get it, soulless you‚Äôll enjoy it more than... what? 4 beers? Half a movie at the cinema without snacks? A pack of cigarettes?
---
It‚Äôs 8 bucks.
---
I gotta try to get through this game without giving up
---
What's wrong with current toon? What level you at?
---
Treasure hunter event was far worse in my opinion. I grinded it for hours the entire time it went on and got nothing - at least we know we can actually get stuff this time if we reach the goal.
---
You're right. Some people simply cannot admit they were wrong by predicting that Bethesda would cheat the numbers. Now Bethesda admitted the mistake by lowering the goal, and these folks are twisting the facts like a pretzel to make it fit into their tin-foil-hat predictions.
---
Some poeple can never learn and would rather keep sucking the dick of other haters than face reality.
---
I'm still quite new to this game (lvl63) and my most hated enemies atm are  those lvl62  **Charred feral ghoul** \- for some reason they mostly one or two hit me !? 
---
###
---
What I'm trying to say is don't get your hopes up. These things get pushed back and pushed back again. Just wait and see cause nobody knows. Yea it's cool they tested it on PTS but from what I know and people have said, the whole system needs to be reworked again.
---
So we don't fail. The changed it and it also jumped from 4.65mil to over 12 mil.
---
Damage over time and radiation can definitely kill you outright. Same with dying in mid air even if it's like only a centimeter in the air. Slopes and uneven surfaces seem to count as mid air a ton for me
---
&gt;THEY FUDGED IT.
---
The didn't. Facts and reality.
---
I do what you need? On ps4?
---
Read the rules first when writing something in a new sub. Your comment is against rule 10.
---
Have you tried modern warfare? Because that takes up ***alot*** of data
---
I agree they don't worth 250 caps lol, I sell them for 20-25 unless I just drop them somewhere first, because nobody wants them. But they're not duped, at least I had like 10 of each after farming SBQ, because they drop each time and I only play this game for like a few months.
---
&gt;Oh, did they make a public statement?
---
What is that old saying? That actions speak loader than words?
---
By lowering the goal Bethesda directly admitted that their original estimate was totally wrong.
---
He didn't ask for your or my opinion on when it will be released, he asked for the official date, which I gave him, he knows it was delayed. I am sorry, I don't see the point of what you're doing.
---
I aint doing shit for that shit.
---
In addition to scrap, make sure you're not sitting on a lot of unrefined ores and gunpowder.
---
What about the grafton monster in Charleston getting folded by super mutants?
---
Any other specific issue aside for the event, there's a known bug with VATS that does precisely what you describe about not doing damage. Could just be that.
---
Exactly. I find funny how some people get a little paranoid with duping looking at a common plan. I also once offered a fresh new lvls a few plans and low lvl legendaries because I didn't know what to do with them, they refused out of fear it's duped xD
---
The question is in the account linking, I think. My Beth and Steam accounts are different ones, is there a way to link them somehow? I know it was possible in April when it worked vice versa - I could play in Steam if I bought F76 in Bethesda.
---
Yup. 
---
You can get 4 rolls of ss a day. If you‚Äôre scripping everyday and doing all the dailies, it would have taken me.... 10 years to get my set. 
---
Ofc it‚Äôs all RNG so who knows. I could have gotten it sooner than 10 years. But it took me 15k modules to get my set and if I got the exact same rolls as I did during that, it would have taken 10 years lol.
---
That‚Äôs like saying red dead redemption 2 does yeah obviously but there‚Äôs reason for them to be that way because of there graphics have you seen 76s they don‚Äôt really compare
---
Well I would argue with that, if you make a build for the end-game you'd want to maximise both damage and defense and in doing so PA is a disadvantage, I am in no means saying it's not useable or that anyone shouldn't I am just saying that I'd like for it to be on-par with regular armor pieces in the end-game grind.
---
Of course PA is still your best option if you want to be a bit tankier while not being specced into anything specific but I wouldn't see the end-game grind for good gear to be an edge case.
---
And it makes absolutely no sense to not use any backpack with normal armor as you are suggesting for carry weight as you get at least the small backpack plans for free when doing the main quest, late-game weight wise regular armor is hard to beat for carry weight as it has weight reduction tertiary legendary perks even if you don't use unyielding but Excavator power armor will still be better if you haven't rolled those legendarys yet
---
how was chest and Jetpack not your first 2 purchases.
---
wow....
---
Lot of times vendor wares don't even appear when I activate a vending machine even though the map shows they have stuff for sale.
---
The...other...sunnys...are...b#tches
---
There is no "official" date. There is only heresay, rumors, and teasers. You can keep looking forward to the next patch, but you will be thoroughly disappointed if you expect anything above the bare minimum with this game my friend. Good day to you.
---
I just love insane NPC vs NPC carnage wherever I can watch it lol
---
I want to see more posts like this, instead of all complaints (well deserved, but still too many). Nice pic!
---
I try! I tried to give out as much as I could. Knew it would get patched soon and if I didn‚Äôt give it away, the good rolls would have just ended up as scrip or sitting on that account for who knows how long until there was another way to trade üòÇ
---
explosive gatling plasma hey?? asking now??
---
congratulations on your gloat. Flex achieved.
---
I‚Äôm going to complete my set tomorrow :) congrats on yours
---
If you go onto the "hot" option for sorting there should be multiple, I am on PC so I have no clue what the UI looks like on any phone, sorry if this doesn't help you

Get all five pieces minus the crotch and 'All Night Long' perk and you're set!
---
If I had access to 1 and 2 I'd be a happy man, alas. But having played all the others, NV is miles ahead my favorite. You should complete 3, I agree it's a little meh but it's still worth a complete seeing as it's all you have left to finish
---
&gt;Instead of auto-completing it, or letting it fail, they ACTUALLY changed the requirement to something that's actually reasonable.
---
Yep. This is far from "fudging the numbers" like some trolls try to suggest. They went the honest route and by changing the goal directly admitted they were wrong. They could have started "pouring in" more concrete into the progress bar and say "some well-stocked people finally went contributing" and hoping we would believe it.
---
don't exaggerate.
---
grind is only for 5 months, 2 hours a day,
---
Happy wandering my friend :-)

A lot of them are broken, best bet is to try another coz it‚Äôs a bit of a pain in the arse
---
Well you see , im on a different account
---
I found one during the nukashine quest, when I woke up out in the woods there was one just off in the distance.
---
Ah sorry, account...banned? :-)
---
Nope i just want to go on my alt !
---
So.. just but some atoms untill its patched?
---
The reason for me is that I already have F76 installed on my PC via Bethesda. I want to play it in Bethesda and switch between accounts when I need it without downloading F76 in Steam again. Guess I need to try to link my Steam acc to Bethesda one, thanks for the hint!
---
He‚Äôs never going to do that. Just move on.
---
I was stuck for while there too, only recently completed it. Aside from that one crater daily there are a few more. Also each time you completely retirement plan choose "Appalachia has a new corpse" and when delivering to Wren refuse the reward. You can also go to Davenport (at overseer's house) and get s daily. Choose foundation, take pics and then get them to Crater, refuse reward. Also on Ohio river adventures deliver mirelurk meat (1 piece of queen's meat gives highest rep). also talk to Fishbones, he'll offer you to defend the water purifiers from mirelurks, after you're done talk to him for rep reward. that quest is about bugged, you'll need to talk to him a bit until he gives you the quest. can be done every day. Also if you see raiders fighting somewhere in the world, you can help them and get a bit of rep. you might already know all this, but I didn't when I started, hope it helps.
---
Well, it's post-apocalyptic wasteland after all. All rules are gone, so do you blame him for trying? It's more like us, players, are to blame for believing him. He may as well pack it all up when he gets all the materials and build a turbomansion in the Forest. And then the Brotherhood comes and smacks us for believing randos...

Oh yeah. We're going to get rich quick.

Oh yeah, lol. Guess I had the wanderer stuck in my brain as a friend has her at his camp, and that repeated guitar chord is driving me *insane.*
---
I see it as valuable for the roleplaying aspect of this game.  
---
I have BOS elder warcoat, PA Elder Paint, knight under armour and use heavy weapons (on one character because she is a BOS). It does not feel the same trying to be BOS without power armour (to me at least).

The rad resistance helps, but mostly I use it for fun.

How can you support Sunny over Sunny? I can at least a bit understand why people like Sunny... but liking Sunny?

I knew it he did It with Skyrim 20 fridge edition

i gasped

I'm sure he's very keen to drop more money on atoms after experiencing this bug...
---
Handmade beats all else.
---
Fixer is overrated.
---
So i linked two accounts but it didn't work, Bethesda doesn't see that my linked Steam account has F76 bought.
---
So the answer to my question is no (unless there is another way to link them).
---
physical copies are dirt cheap at gamestop if you‚Äôre on console literally like ten bucks

It seems vats doesn't work properly. I have the same problem that I can't deal any dmg to players via vats :/

Lol needed a giggle this morning! Ad Victoriam
---
Sure its a bug, but after 1st picture not registering...would you continue to do the remaining 19?.. just saying maybe the frustration is on thier part.
---
Happened to me... it was not fun..
---
&gt; Well I would argue with that, if you make a build for the end-game you'd want to maximise both damage and defense and in doing so PA is a disadvantage 
---
It's a mistake to assume people who have reached the end-game min-max for damage and defense. 
---
Hell, I have an end-game build that is very far from being min maxed and yet meets my end game needs to my satisfaction, both in PA and normal armour (I switch between the two).
---
I wouldn't be at all surprised that min-maxers for combat are in the minority of end game players. No doubt these people would likely be top tier (if such ranking existed) but the game is so easy that even a grossly inefficient build can still be effective in the end game.
---
15 weapons? Nice, might find something decent.
---
Oh it's they're non legendary.
---
Like others said, a lot of challenges are broken and have been broken.
---
But let me suggest this: Make sure you take the photos with the basic camera not the upgraded one with the improved lens. Make sure the location name appears in the upper right when you focus in.
---
Sometimes that registers it.
---
I think it would probably make me less inclined to give BGS more money. I'd probably just call it quits for the day
---
I never seen one of these, right?
---
Its says you cant recorver, but you do.. if thats changed or patched in the future, who knows.. but in terms of utility its useless unless you fight hordes of mobs that are level 1

Better is all relative.

Better than launch, without question. Though that doesn't really say all that much.

If it's under 1/4 whatever your standard local retail price is, I'd go for it. Just be aware, it plays somewhat differently to past games. If you love hoarding and collecting, you're going to find this game very frustrating.
---
you need to find and equip a WORKING Enforcer perk.  That will fix rad rumble.
---
Goodluck and let me know when and where you found it. I miss mine.
---
Cursed weapons will be introduced when the new boss event releases. So they're not available yet
---
how do i get this to work ,i cant even figure out how to download it
---
Pretty sure they are only specific weapons. And always have the same effects, like the fancy shotgun
---
That Enclave agent sent to take Sam Blackwell
---
They addressed a known exploit.
---
Thank you for sharing all this!
---
I knew I wouldn't touch the ss armor because of the terrible rng and the possibility to get 1* pieces ...and now I'm sure I don't ever do that!
---
I'll stick to my regular and good rolled armor pieces and save my modules for some new weapons, they will hopefully implement with new factions... we'll see
---
Oh yea I only go into that cave to farm deathclaws
---
Septemer(ish) I think I heard last.
---
i loved Fah Hahbah!
---
Patch 22 Sep, that's what we've been told by Beth
---
Samee
---
Bone shards. Leather, if you're not using leather armor (plus it's easy to farm if you do) . Glass.  Concrete, if your base is already built. Black titanium is only useful for power armor.  You only need a little ceramic.
---
It's actually easier to list the ones you absolutely need. Steel, plastic, adhesive, wood, acid, screws, springs, and gears. Everything else, keep about 5 bulk of. 
---
I bet though, if you really look at your aid tab, you could trim so much there. All those chems you'll never actually take, ask those stimpaks you don't really need, and all that food you'll never eat
---
they have revised the total down to 15 Million and we are currently at 12 million so we may be able to achieve it
---
It did the trick!
---
Amazing!
---
Welcome to Appalachia
---
It‚Äôs a pretty massive map.
---
It's so useful for score 
---
also after using the alt account I made after wastelanders release but never truly used until a week afo I'm getting much more score
---
:(
---
Oh yeah Giving up is clearly the solution to my problem. Thanks. Never thought about it that way
---
I feel this comment. This game has so much untapped potential. And the patches are ridiculous nerfs. They removed the "fun stuff" like survival servers and vault raids, building is a chore now, magic weapons are stupid, vats is STILL broken, server stability is just sad, NO new NW maps or updates, stash space and cap limits should have been increased with wastelanders... I could go on all day.
---
Its happened to me 4 times in last 2 days. X1X. I go home, quit game, start again and then it loads.
---
well I tried to go to different areas within the forest region and still nothing. dont know whats so bad about a little trial and error.
---
Should have made it 18 million. For a challenge to be a challenge, there needs to be real chance of failure
---
AFAIK from youtubers, only melee weapons will drop
---
i'm hoping that it'll be the same loot pool with more stuff added, would love another chance to get the plans i was unable to obtain from the pails.
---
i disagree- theres plenty there, it just isnt worth the effort
---
i sat on abandoned bog town between dailies and netted a few hundred, but i feel disincentivised to do more because of the lack of reward
---

---
Just throw money at it is what Bethesdas motto is at this point...
---
Bad enough to take to reddit and rant about it apparently...
---
Who ever downvoted you is lying to themselves lol everyones gotta know at this point right? Fallout 1st is riddled with false promises and assets you're forced into needing, not to mention its choosing to slap new shit content on to cover up the content that they don't want to spend time fixing because it doesn't bring in cash
---
Cursed shovels...
---
Well 150m was pretty unreasonable given how hard to come by concrete is. Steel is the most common material in the game so 125 made sense.
---
Yes, yes you can
---
I mean.... if you already have your dream weapons then I guess go for the armor. At a certain point, there will be a time where you have everything you want and  it‚Äôs like ehhh why not waste my scrip on this shit. If you‚Äôre still hunting for a be fixer or something.... it would be better to go for guaranteed 3 stars imo. 
---
With the price of the modules, they need to just make it guaranteed 2-3 stars. The way it is now, you are paying twice the scrip for 1 stars. And they are so heavy that I end up just destroying them cuz I don‚Äôt want to hold onto 50lbs of scrip.
---
I hope your tetanus shots are up to date!
---
Chest was the first but then got told it could take ages to get the right legendary effects on the Armor so went ahead and did the Armor first
---
I'm sorry to hear that. I know it was a deal breaker for a lot of people. I'm sorry its ruined the game for you. Hopefully they'll implement a double sided wall to make up for it soon. It'd save us a bunch of budget. Until then, have a good one. ):
---
Someone was using a gun that creates ash piles.  It's bugged as hell right now.  Happens a lot in Uranium Fever too because some turd bucket comes in with a tesla rifle and makes ash piles of everything.  Makes the framerate PLUMMET too.
---
I've seen this same weird pixelation glitch inside of a side tunnel after Uranium Fever, I've also seen it happen inside the Big Bend Tunnel during Riding Shotgun. Not sure if it's random or related to meat piles.
---
Well if you finish wastelanders and accquire secret service gear its much easier cause you can craft specific armor part allowing you to focus on what you actually need.
---
Concrete foundations have an effect on your spawn point aswell. When I build a camp at the top of Ceneca rocks, I would always spawn on the "invisible stair part" of a concrete foundation. Managed to play around and move my spawn point where I wouldn't fall to my death when logging in.
---
Haha obviously not, but alot of the challenges have been broken since launch. Best thing you can do is submit a ticket and hope for the best.
---
Quitting was in regards to not buying atoms from the store.
---
You get my upvote for this reference
---
My personal rule of thumb: Keep everything that you use for ammo crafting or repairing your gear.  Bulk and sell everything else except for about 100-150 of each.
---
Yeah but its not like they have huge manpower (we know that from amount of bugs and not testing content) to dedicate searching through all accounts. But here they would be giving themselves on silver plate.
---
Yes.   That was the case back then.  But now I don't think you can do it backwards.  If you want to play on Beth launcher, you'll need to purchase the game again through that.
---
Rly? Look at some bug which are here from start. Some require even less work( hell, moders are giving them solutions written in gamƒô code and they still cannot implement them.
---
Only skins AFAIK, does he know how to do it?
---
Favourites wheel, in there
---
And best in all this is - i got that shitty hat without donating single junk. :D   And as i gather, this event mainly is for dupers ho can afford donating 10-100k of junk that they made in illegal ways. Plus reward vs those 250units you give up is a freakin punch in face.
---
Open your favorites wheel and it will tell you which button to press to deploy your tent. On ps4 it's triangle.
---
Has your friend tried closing and restarting their game? Idk if that'll fix it, but it could be as simple as that
---
I'll hold on to my resources til they allow me to stock up on more without a 800lb limit, thank you very much.
---
Cursed pick axe is another I know that drops...think its 1 more
---
In which reality did we genuinely get 150 million concrete?  The reality is they changed to require less.  That's a fudge.  Sorry if that unavoidable *actual* reality is unappealing to you.
---
Because they don‚Äôt actually care
---
I want to say it's all mining related stuff that drops. 3rd one slipped my mind
---
Yeah, I mentioned it was my gfs Gauss rifle. But weirdly enough it only effected me, not her. First time I've seen it happen. She usually only uses that gun on SBQ, asked her not to use it in events with normal legendaries any more
---
Also bugfixes would add more things to do since you would finally be able to try new builds that weren't viable because of said bugs. It's the main reason why I'm stuck on a single character right now. I want to play a beefy guy who rely solely on melee and explosive weapons damn it.
---
I mean, their MO is to come into an area, and take away everyone‚Äôs high technology. I think that brotherhood of steel message is garbled enough that it could definitely be menacing/threatening. I would not be surprised if they found out about all of the enclave sponsored nuking, and is on their way out to shut it down.
---
i thought it would be in atom store too because mine is in there
---
Yeah, I didn't remember seeing it in my options to select on lvl up, so I guess that other dude is lying/confused about jumping from the top of buildings in Watoga
---
That‚Äôs sort of what I was thinking. That the BOS is on their way to put a stop to all of the nuking.
---
&gt;I'm level 141, been playing for roughly 3-weeks now
---
How?!?
---
I've been 'steam rolling' the game according to my veteran friend and racing through the levels...
---
I just hit 57 after playing 6+ hours a day for the last month solid. 
---
Always got my lovers embrace and canned stew, running mission chains and events mainly, with sporadic side missions. Wasn't trying to blaze through the levels but it just happened. 
---
So how on Earth did you hit 141 in 20 days? ;p
---
So what you're saying is... We should nuke the Brotherhood for trying to take our nukes away?
---
Jumping from buildings in watoga? Not at all, you can get goats legs in adventure mode. But you don‚Äôt need 9 AGI to get it.
---
I feel like i'm just paying for the atoms, it¬¥s a better deal then just buying atoms. And as an avid camp builder i buy stuff from the atom shop all the time. So i¬¥d be buying the atoms regardless, so why not get the extra benefits. And i probably buy roughly 4.000 atoms a month (+1000 extra as a bonus) plus the 1600 that comes with the subscription.   
---
Here are the benefits i like about it. 
---
* Private worlds - non looted places guaranteed, solo missions, workshops,  less lag, transfer between characters.  
---
* Survival tent - Free fast travel point, Stash and scrap box on hand, able to cook any meat at any time. Well tuned and well rested at all times possible. 
---
* Scrap box - Literally couldn't live without it, I have over 500.000 in junk and am aiming to have 100.000 of every resource (Just a personal goal for me) I wouldn't be able to manage my stash if i had to deal with junk too in there.
---
People can literally just server hop, just wasting your own time but go for it
---
Alright, i should probably take a decon shower and get rid of speed demon then, just to be sure
---
Ah so this is what happened to me at radiation rumble the other day. There was a team of 4 guys using telsas and it got so glitchy i couldn't even move at one point. Wonder why this is just happening recently, i don't remember ever seeing framerate drop this dramatically before
---
Really? Didn't know that. I'll try it out.
---
You probably have skins for it, that's why it's in the Atom store for you.
---
Roll for an insight check
---
Hemlock Holes has 3 nodes with great output and the disposal site has some as well. I take the workshops once a week and end up with more acid than I know what to do with and a free travel point on either side of the map. I don't even bother collecting bug parts anymore. ;p
---
Gargantuan games are just a fact of modern life now...devs are too lazy to crunch down code and we keep wanting prettier and prettier games (i know 76 doesnt look that pretty) but effects and everything still require textures and everything.
---
Eeeeeh ok.
---
Thank you for this.
---
I think it might come down to a faction fight between the brotherhood and the enclave.
---
I think in terms of content it should be more given what they have declared. It¬¥s also character heavy focused. So it will be more in depth about the stories of the people in the brotherhood. I¬¥m also guessing they will bring some sort of a difficult moral choice, between the two BOS groups.
---
I don't know I have done all of them beside the SB queen one,so I don't really know what to say.
---
Except this seems to be put of date with some of the bulk stuff
---
Reminds me of the neighbors house in Hello Neighbor
---
[Missile Silo State Holotape](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Missile_silo_state_holotape)
---
Cursed mining helmet, beams laser out like a glitched to fuck current Assultron, but breaks after one shot...like the heads do :-)
---
I noticed this and did it, but then I played the match anyway to get my XP bar closer to the next level for the next time that's the daily NW challenge. Hid in a bush until the only area out of the fire was nuked, then slowly died. Placed 6th!
---
Agility tree: Equipping Mr. Sandman card before the Covert Op card gives you a 3,75x sneak attack multiplier at night.
---
Luck tree: Currently Class Freak card is bugged, you have to re-equip the card after joining a server in order to activate it's effect.
---
Charisma tree: Strange in Numbers gives you a major buff to all of your mutations when in a public team (which you should always join or create one)
---
Forest Camo Jumpsuit, Responder Fireman Uniform, Tattered Field Jacket &amp; Traveling Leather Coat (these are all drops from events) are extremely rare and you can easily drop or sell them because you're unaware of their worth, especially the Forest Camo Jumpsuit since it drops from The Forest events and they're not leveled items.
---
This is exactly the issue with this part. With the steel I easily donated at least twice every day just doing my daily challenges if I actively collected the weapons. This I've actually tried collecting concrete. Got all the bags from the usual spots and even the 3 resource nodes at bog town to barely get 250 concrete. This number is ludicrous to hit. If we cpumd donate numbers less than 250 would also be handy because finding that much concrete alone is tough. Let us donate by the 50s or 100s.
---
*Scrip!
---
I think almost everyone has experienced a problem with a bot not spawning. So we do feel your pain. Even with the glitch, or maybe even because of it. it was one of the most satisfying and entertaining quests of the game. After rerunning the entire instance you have nothing. My vampire shotgun lay  broken with my 2 best pieces of armor At the level I was I might as well been naked. Then I come upon the boss. Re drops grenades for me in the open so I circle around to get the bot on the other side of a building while I grab and lob the grenade(in my panic) no where close to the bot. I was sure I was done I'm playing ring around the rosy with the bot and find a couple land mines in my inventory and place those down. Re drops more grenades and I get a hold of my fear and make direct hits until the bot finally goes down. Whew.....time to loot.  Boom....bot explodes.....dead. At least I finished the quest. Right?
---
Give him a hacked weapon and report him.
---
Oh my it was hilarious someone got killed with a minigun that shoots mirv mininukes at radiation rumble on purpose shortly after release...
---
That's the one!
---
Pretty sure making more threads about this seems to the community strat.
---
And the Enclave has the nukes, square up Brotherthots
---
What about they take your camp budget since you don't care, leave you with a tent with the neccesities plus a vending machines and redistribute that budget to the rest?
---
I sell the both the ultracite mods and the prime receivers fairly often. No sense at all in selling the ultracite PA plans as those are so common. I just drop them at white springs for whoever might want them.
---
Holy cow really? Hunter hunted without vats sounds great. Too bad you can still use it to spot players.
---
For me, ghouls. 1 hit i died
---
Don¬¥t worry be happy, trolls keep on trolling
---
It's a tiny pop up with no instructions on how to actually join in.  I have no clue what it's all about either and don't care enough to google it, let this dude find his own scrap like the rest of us! üòÇ
---
The only issue is that this makes too much sense.
---
Also they should let us stock up on technical data and turn it into a person for something too instead of the random chances at power armor paint. I don't even want to guess how many it took til I got the Eldar paint.
---
did u use camera or photo mode
---
mind sharing your perk load out for your bloodied/junkie's build.  I have been thinking about doing that.  I am currently a junkie's build
---
You for the ivory handles and barbed walking cane plans.
---
"stalker" music intensifies
---
I mean, I've been saying this from the beginning. I've seen mods with more content than this game.
---
Bethesda made it to be as grindy as possible, not unlike mobile games. this way they don't really have to invest in mechanics, quests or anything really. just repetition. the playerbase does the rest.
---
I‚Äôll be honest that I haven‚Äôt followed updates on steel dawn. I guess we will wait and see.
---
Lmao!!
---
There is a npc in flatwoods which is hyped by the responders work aswell. Seems she could be used soon to build up the responders.
---
Lmao!!!
---
Did you tell him how to place it?
---
I love RPG's. But the amount of times my characters have trusted complete strangers  without the ability to doubt, is crazy.
---
cursed means increased attack speed at the cost of weapon degradation. they only drop on a shovel, an pickaxe and a harpoon gun. they are fixed rolls too, the pickaxe is a B40p90 for example. i think the harpoon is an executioners, and i dont remember what the shovel is.
---
the pickaxe will be good because you basically get faster swing speed AND more power damage when normally that is impossible.
---
Or just the actual numbers. I don‚Äôt think reddit whining had anything to do with it. It was an unrealistic goal given the scarcity of the resource.
---
Sorry, put it on the wring post. The "Chally Oop" comment make me bust out, lol.
---
Sounds about right. Our group launches several SBQ nukes per day but I'm getting less and less excited about the event. Either it is boring as hell (doesn't land) or it's over within a minute and there are barely any minions to kill. 
---
One simple solution: nuke private worlds. If our group is on private, I'll gladly run a silo. When we are on public, I must admit I only go into a silo when people ask me to.
---
People should have the decency to only melt queens that they nuked themselves.
---
I have installed an ash pile replacer mod. Still testing it. Good thing I don't play nuclear winter
---
This game has potential. To b broken with each patch release. Til now. Plasma goo n ash heaps still covers normal meat pile that you cant loot and many other things... so if you genuinely ask if it has gotten any better? My take is absolutely a big NO.
---
As shitty as it can b
---
its all the todd textures
---
Cyberpunk people, it'll be fun
---
I mean, if it works for you, that's great.  
---
What I really wish is a massive boost to all those other prefixes (Berskerker, Mutant; hell even Nocturnal could work with some crazy extra dmg) to spice up builds and disrupt stale meta.
---
Agree with some of this but it has me hooked!
---
Grahm?
---
only seen it once in 2019 in whitesprings resort.
---
I just ground both factions to ally in about a month. 
---
1) do your faction dailies. Choose the options that get you extra rep. 
---
2) sell the photos to the faction that you are lagging behind on
---
3) visit Ohio River adventures with more lurk queen meat. Turn that in to blackeye. Visit the other raider in the boat and talk to him. In his dialog options is another rep quest you can do once per day for the raiders. Defend the water pipe daily as well. 
---
4) learn where the random encounters for factions are. Create a route and visit multiple spots daily.
---
I would wait for BOS to return. I assume new weapons and armour to grind for, but also new quests...
---
It would b extremely awesome if we did nothing n watch how bethesda response to player non-participation.
---
I can agree to a certain point. I do feel the grind however, and not just killing and xp grinding, but all of the artificial timers and micromanagement. The game really does feel like a chore after a while. I loaded up a couple of different games this week and it was the most liberating feeling to be  able to do whatever it is you need to do without fear of becoming too heavy or maxing out your curency.
---
Modus in ws bunker
---
They changed it but they not informed about it. As usual. Communication is hard.
---
I got a load of unyielding- will look later.
---
If you only do the same thing over and over every time you log in that‚Äôs on you. I personally don‚Äôt worry about the dailies.
---
The Bethesda event page where you can track progress also has a time lapse of the progress.
---
To confirm - did you use the actual camera?  (Not photo mode)
---
I am looking for one of these pieces for kingdom come, if you will have lemme know man, appreciate it big time, I am sure you may want smth from my trades
---
Well I personally don‚Äôt donate and in fact stopped playing because we didn‚Äôt have the storage to stockpile in advance and the rewards aren‚Äôt worth the effort at all. I need that steel for 2mm EC, not stimpaks and beers. Only subbers had the capacity to prepare in advance, everyone else is supposed to gather the mats just now and carry it with buckets. Not doing that for this.
---
Does he have a higher chance of dropping it than the others?
---
ah, thats what I was interested in. Do they announce these updates somewhere.?
---
Check all the white springs vendors
---
I don‚Äôt know about the others. I just know I‚Äôve always bought it from him when I start a new character.
---
I m not paying for anything, still playing
---
I never particularly understand these posts tbh. If you've played it for 550 hours then you have really got your money's worth. In the grand scheme there isn't many games you can put that much time into, you're bound to get burnt out.
---
Are you taking with the camera or photo mode?
---
They overestimated so much that I wonder what they were thinking in the first place. I keep like 30 concrete at any time because of the storage limitations, no way people could conjure that amount when they did not have a big stockpile.
---
"ah nu cheeki breeki iv damke"
---
You'll find the stash limit annoying, no other hindrances though...
---
what are the rewards for this event?
---
Screw tops... 
---
That's why we don't get cork from drinking wine or scrapping the bottles.
---
Why wouldn't legionaries be a grind? People say that like it's a bad thing "Bethesda wants us to grind for amazing op weapons".   
---
I agree that it's a hazzle. But i don¬¥t think people realize that this not a game you can win, there is no winning, except for personal goals you make yourself. Now they have to have a grind for people to log in regularly to keep the game alive, like every MMO.  
---
I think a lot of Fallout fans and people who play the game are confused what this game is about, like that everyone is supposed to be able to get the best gear. It¬¥s not going to happen and not going to make for an interesting multiplayer experience.    
---
What they need to do is to add more builds via perk cards and gear to counter the meta Bloodied. And in my opinion nerf the bloodied, it's too OP to the point of boring, (I¬¥m a bloodied build myself with two legacies and a B2525 handmade and i still think so) You shouldn¬¥t be able to get everything or be everything.
---
Even the 300 odd hours he said he enjoyed. That's a good return on investment if you ask me. The only games I've put that much time in are diablo 3 and skyrim. But ive put 1.2k hours in 76 lol
---
I did it twice. Got super ucky the 2nd tine i guess because i needed a daily as well. 2 megasloths and and funally, an alien. No gun drops though if that is a thing.
---
I just checked my main, none on this one let me check my other one, just in case
---
I sell them for 25 caps and and it sells ;-)
---
So you think people should buy the game for a one time fee and never put in anymore money while still providing free content updates?  Makes sense...
---
To answer your question you don't need to spend any money to play the game.  The atom shop is 99% cosmetic only and the stuff that isn't cosmetic only is not by any means a necessity.  Fallout 1st is also not a necessity as we played the game for a long time without it.   You can get a lot of hours out of this game without spending any exrta cash.
---
1x Nuka Grape can also be found in TNT Dome 7, along with Plan: X-01 Nuka Quantum Paint.
---
It's fine to take a break. No point playing the game if you're not enjoying it.
---
Nobody steal ur shits
---
Time to bow out? :-)
---
I started playing recently through Gamepass for PC. I'm having fun, I haven't spent a dime and I have 1.5k atoms saved from doing F2P challenges. I would definitely be more inclined to spend them (and more) if Bethesda didn't cycle out the items I like.
---
I love flying with the scorchbeast queen, when the game starts to lag from all that is going on, the jetpack becomes godlike and you can fly high af and for days, its so much fun during SBQ fights. I can even use it to fly onto the roof of fort defiance if line in the sand is going.
---
&gt; I mean, their MO is to come into an area, and take away everyone‚Äôs high technology.
---
Thats why I'll never join them in any fallout game. Unless it's to dupe them and steal their shit.
---
Just about üòÖüòÇüòÇ good analogy üëèüëèüòÖ
---
PVP is a joke in this game,especially with the last changes.
---
sounds good, but how would you compare your experience with someone who payed?   
---
i kinda want to know what the difference is
---
It took me 2 months give or take.. I play 5hits a day
---
I pay nothing except the PS4 networking charge which is compulsory for Fallout76
---
what kind of limits are we talking about?   
---
like a max weight or amount?   
---
can you overcome that with extra chests?
---
No idea, I'm doing it more for the achievement associated to killing 20 players
---
No, thanks. I'm not gonna uninstall it... yet...
---
What you describing is a simple "burned out" or "played enough" effect. Not matter how good the game is and how much content it have it will happen anyway sooner or later and it's ok. I've seen this in other multiplayer and single games and I'm expireinced that aswell.
---
Okay.  See you.
---
800 max weight, no extra
---
"I've seen mods with more content than this game"
---
Okay dude
---
Some one just did this on Xbox this morning. I just stood and took it like a champ. Even got an achievement. Shame the queens health regenerated. Though only had 5 mins left and would she hell land.
---
Just build the doors last, after you dinished everything, problemo solvedo
---
\&gt;So you think people should buy the game for a one time fee and never put in anymore money while tbr developers still provide free content updates? Makes sense... 
---
yea, like how it was done for over 20 years. base game, + expansions. 
---
but it is nice to know its not a necessity.
---
Well, here is the link to the stats page:
---
 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events) 
---
Seems to contain the word "events" which suggests that, whatever you or I might think, Bethesda thinks it is an event...
---
cycle out items?   
---
you mean in the shop or do actual items become useless?
---
I just finished the "kill 1100 robots with a fist weapon for 80 atoms" challenge and it only gave me 40 atoms as well. I don't expect to get the other 40. I just won't be doing anymore atom challenges until I know it's been fixed.
---
its a mod for the laser rifle i use it on the short barrelt and you get the laser pistol look with the rod
---
Oh OK understand, fist time I've heard of them.
---
Got them for free when fo76 was ported to steam, was a nice gift and I plan on playing them one day...
---
Cork is easy as hell to get. Equip scrapper, build pipe pistol (bolt or normal) scrap it, cork. Rinse and repeat
---
The cosmetics in the shop, they only stay for a few days then they change them for different ones. For example, the Mothman Bundle or the Silver Shroud stuff.
---
Yes, a max weight for your entire stash. No extra chests like fo4. 
---
With paid sub you get an extra chest that holds unlimited junk crafting items. Of course there are other perks but thats the stash aspect of it.
---
I love spawning under the map while carrying flux
---
There is no way they based the goals on actual player inventories. I could maybe believe it if the steel goal was higher, but no one has more concrete and/or cork than steel without going out of their way to collect tons of concrete and cork. Steel is just way more readily available from just playing the game normally.
---
I wish.  I am so sick of seeing them everywhere.
---
Atom shop is a different team, they have no effect on the game development.
---
Fallout 1st is not required at all. Every other atomic shop item is basically just cosmetic. Repair kits are useless imo because you can repair with scrap more effectively.
---
This isn't 20 years ago.  Times have changed.  The cost of making and maintaining a game has gone up.  Server costs, employees need to get paid more, equipment is more expensive and becomes obsolete more quickly needing to be replaced and shareholders expect more from the bottom line in 2020.  
---
Gaming will not go back to how it used to be.  This is modern online gaming now.  The only places you will get that old model is single-player games.
---
Exactly! I donated over 10,000 steel to get some rewards and it was almost all crap. I did get a single bloodied 3 star legendary along with lots of junk toys, enough alcohol to stay smashed for weeks to come over the dumb decision I made ü§£
---
Yes I updated one of the conversations in this thread 45 days ago with this info. I‚Äôll edit the main post now, didn‚Äôt think anyone was still looking for a key that never had a purpose from the start!
---
And an army of robots from all of those bots on parade events we‚Äôve been recruiting for them.
---
You used to pay for expansions. You don‚Äôt need to with this game. They are free.
---
Tbh at this point whenever a new thing is released or in the atom shop I wonder and guess what's wrong with It when I see it
---
monkaHmm
---
It isn't, but at least it's farmable. I finally did this Saturday to max settler reputation. I just fast traveled between marigold pavilion and slocums joe and then server hopped over and over. It was incredibly annoying but at least it's done.
---
What?üòÇüòÇ
---
What an ultimate garbage, thanks for the info tho
---
I would like to know as well.whats in them besides mounted plans.any power armour plans?I had 1 large present in my inventory but never checked the weight.if no awnser I'll check after work on that for you
---
I think this is referring to Fallout 4 and the others, there were some amazing third party expansion mods for them.
---
I've been playing off and on since beta, i know it was supposed to launch last summer. But i figure any day now. Especially with it being in PTS. And my pip boy having perk coins in collection tab its gotta be soon ish
---
Hours dont really matter with rep. It take like 15 minutes to do all 3 rep quests and turn in the mirelurk meat
---
Can you actually sell water and food?
---
Why do you ask?
---
Questions like this let only one conclusion, since the presents aren't available anymore.
---
That's fucking interesting, man.
---
&gt;Fallout 1st is also not a necessity as we played the game for a long time without it.
---
You say this and yet people who've gotten it says that it's game changing and some of them even openly admit it's pay2win.
---
A practically limitless scrapbox and extra free fast travel point with mini camp ain't nothing to scoff at.
---
.1
---
There‚Äôre people offering me like 10k of those and idk of my char can carry it. I‚Äôm too lazy to get them
---
"Everyone liked that"
---
Not to mention, we also have the 
---
*Kovac-Muldoon Platform* (in robot voice)
---
Don't do it. Don't trade with them, report them straight for duping.
---
From the previous day and week? I‚Äôm on US EDT and the challenges don‚Äôt reset for another 4 hours 44 mins.
---
I vaguely recall that the New California Republic had a gold reserve that they were using to back a new paper currency...until the BOS nuked it, rendering it useless/valueless/radioactive, resulting in a return to the good ol' cap.
---
Oh yeah, here we go:
---
" 
---
The NCR introduced its own money around the turn of the 22nd century and initially it relied on coins minted from gold. By 2241, the economy of NCR dominated the West Coast and coins became universal currency, used by the three regional powers: [NCR](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/New_California_Republic_(town)), [Vault City](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_City) and [New Reno](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/New_Reno). During this time [bottle caps](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bottle_cap) had become worthless in these regions.[\[1\]](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/NCR_dollars#cite_note-0)
---
During the [conflict with the Brotherhood](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_War) the Republic's gold reserves were destroyed by Brotherhood raids to the point where new gold coins could not be minted and paper money could not be properly backed with gold. NCR citizens panicked and rushed to reclaim the listed face value of currency from NCR's remaining gold reserves. Since the NCR was unable to realize these withdrawals, particularly towards the frontier, faith in their currency considerably dropped. To protect against actual economic collapse, the NCR government abandoned the gold standard and established [fiat currency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_currency), not payable in specie.[\[2\]](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/NCR_dollars#cite_note-Sawyer1-1) Since then many wastelanders lost faith in it as a medium of worth, both as a result of it not being backed by anything but the government's word and the inevitable inflation.[\[3\]](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/NCR_dollars#cite_note-sawyer2-2) In response to the loss of faith, merchant consortiums of the Hub re-established their own currency, the veritable bottle cap, backing it with water (exchanging a standardized measure of water for caps).[\[4\]](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/NCR_dollars#cite_note-3)[\[5\]](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/NCR_dollars#cite_note-THEWAR-4)
---
I know there are caps in them
---
Oh okay thanks!
---
If you can see it, we still have invisible masks in there lol
---
My Fallout 76 install does not take up data, but does use space on my SSD.
---
I see...maybe you're getting unlucky and landing on a server you've already been on? I havent had to do it in a while. A player gifted me all the scout backpack mod plans, fixer plan, and bear arm plans, so my grind ended after that.
---
Did you try both stores at watoga im sure one of them have ot.
---
I'm grinding for the Forest Camo Jumpsuit which apparently has the same sort of drop rate from The Forest events. Frustrating as hell :-) But then again it's the only item I really really want anymore, so I guess it's worth the grind. 
---
Not racking too much XP from those events, though...
---
This is why I don‚Äôt mind dropping money for Atoms or first. So far they keep adding content for free, and yeah, I am definitely think they should be compensated for their labor.
---
Checked both and none of them have it.
---
The game is perfectly playable without having to pay more than the base game price because (at least as of now) the DLC content doesn't cost any extra money. 
---
I'd never recommend paying full price for it but if you get it on sale, you can get value out of it playing the main quest line.
---
Well, except the main quest is currently broken and I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't get fixed until at least a month later but aside from that, yeah.
---
That's not the point. The point is after 2 years this game is basically in beta and bugged out bad STILL. It's annoying as hell. When I build up my character around bows finally get an amazing bow that actually worked great and for some stupid reason they nerf reload speed... And one of the legendary attributes of the bow was faster reload speed. It's complete shit and I'm having to re-spec my entire build now at over level 100. That shit's annoying. Yes yes one will arguing well don't spec your character around one weapon, but I did. My fuck up and I learned from it.
---
1.2k hours in game. Have not signed up for first. The only difference is private worlds, which I wouldn't use anyway (you can't get on a team, no one shopping at your vendors), and the scrap box. Admittedly the scrap box would be nice and all. But again 1.2k hours in game and have not needed it at all. And the tent, which is a free fast travel point I guess? Not a game changer imo
---
Not to hand. But I‚Äôve seen threads in the past where it was data mined. 
---
Add to that you can see that even with an identical DR you‚Äôll take less damage in PA than you will in normal armour (-7% per PA piece) it‚Äôs easy enough to test.
---
It used to be every time you switched servers. Sounds like it might be different now, judging from another post.
---
That was the real community event, see how many times we could finish bots on parade and for every time it was finished the ones who choose the Brotherhood side get an extra 5 bots to fight
---
Why have more than one life saving piece does it stack? I run with one piece and it‚Äôs probably the same for me
---
As of this morning, still about 2.5M short. I agree; I didn't have a lot of concrete scrap to begin with, and concrete farming isn't as simple as steel/wood/almost anything else. 
---
Man, shoulda got that concrete mixer from the Settlers.
---
Urgh, it's sad that we have to server hop to play this game.
---
I've done both factions to max on my main, not gonna bother on my alt until there's some.new ways to gain rep or a new exploit come out.
---
All hail Kovie
---
...and yet, you‚Äôre STILL thinking about it, crafting lengthy posts about it. 
---
Prediction: you‚Äôll be back.
---
Isn‚Äôt it the BoS vendor?
---
shady question xD
---
When the BoS actually gets here and they're not the heroes he thinks they are it's going to lead to an interesting story arc for him.
---
I'm not playing to win :)
---
I always end up in a nearby pool taking rads...thanks for that. Gonna move it tonight.
---
Maybe in bum fuck nowhere its 7.25. most states changed minimum wage to 15$ an hour
---
That have more content than 76?  I will admit have done only a vanilla fallout 4 play-through since it first came out.  I did mod play-throughs of 3 and NV and while there were some nice mods none of them came close to 76 in terms of content by themselves....  And I'd like to point out that "overhauls" are not content.
---
I too was caught in the button bashing to try and exit the console until I learnt you can just hold the back button. Just saying.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt even use the converter after the first time I used it I just dump my trash ammo. The time it takes to use that damn thing you could quickly find lead and steel to just craft your own with better results.
---
I don't care about this event because I think it's a scam, it doesn't matter if our how much we donate, Bethesda wouldn't  let that event fail anyways. If it fails it will be very negative for the company...    Just imagine they have to publish that the event failed, all the recources spent by players who tried are lost and games magazines will definitely cover this
---
Steel is also more commonly used. Once you have your camp set, you aren‚Äôt using concrete. I have thousands of concrete among my characters
---
take it off of any sweet jumps?
---
Did they actually 'nerf' the reload speed, I can't find any reference to this. I would guess they broke it along with all the other things in the patch 21.
---
Still frustrating though but may get fixed, although given Bethesda's track record I wouldn't hold your breath.
---
The game is built on a crumbling foundation and will never be stable, just try to get what enjoyment you can from it, then seriously maybe move on and call it a day, I'm not sure I will play much longer.
---
I think that actually may be the plan once they arrive, I tried to listen through the radio static and I could swear that they are planning to take Atlas by force. It sounded to me like they have already gone over to their "all your technology are belong to us" doctrine and the other factions aren't going to take kindly to that.
---
The whole "gold" quest line was troubling to me.  Everyone acted as if gold was inherently valuable, after the apocalypse mind you, but never bothered to explain why...
---
I mean, you can't eat it.  You can't reasonably build with it.  With the current supply huge and the current population tiny, it's not even rare.
---
I mean I suppose you could make bullets or radiation shielding out of it...and it's not toxic like lead...but given that a bucket of paint in Fallout 76 yields 5 lead when scrapped I think it's clear that prewar America wasn't worried about lead poisoning...
---
It's just silly.
---
They weigh 0.1 pound. Best thing to do is either create a alt to transfer them to or give them to a friend then got on a mule and get them back. that way theres no chance of them disappearing. Someone gave me 10k lol had to make an alt.
---
I sell almost all my plans for 5 caps and all recipes for 3 caps, I'm a level 267.  The ultracite come from defeating the scotch beast queen. The newbs in the game dont have the mounted plans and there are allot of new players
---
If you're as familiar with PM as you say you are, it's basically a feature request with no extra budget, time or resources. Some dev just retrofitted something already existing not really fit for purpose to do the job with as little time and effort spend on development and testing.
---
If scope increases but cost and time doesn't, you know what gets affected, right? Bethesda in a nutshell :)
---
&gt;even openly admit it's pay2win.
---
How is it pay2win?  What are you winning?  What is the endgame that I am paying to win faster.  Does having springs in my scrapbox make me do more damage to the queen?  Did having all that steel in my scrapbox make me one shot the imposter sheepsquatch while face-tanking the laser?  
---
No.  Having more junk than someone else is not "pay2win".  The only people who say it's pay2win are the people who are really really jealous about all of the features but are too cheap to shell out a few bucks a month for it.
---
Shoot him
---
I had a similar problem a few weeks ago and it was driving me mad. After a long and very boring process of elimination I ended up resetting a pair of TP-link power line adaptors that provided my network connection on the gaming machine. No problems after that. I know it's a long shot!
---
To find out, start making a little list. Every time you craft or fix something, things you do fairly regularly record the materials you use. Do this for a week or so and you will then have a personal and definitive list of the essentials you need to have a stock of, then sell everything else except maybe 10-20 of each.
---
This. ANY damage you receive after the ‚Äúkilling‚Äù hit will stop you going Down But Not Out, ghouls can be poison or there 2-3 hit combo, Super Mutants it‚Äôs rapid fire weapons (they‚Äôll stop shooting the moment you are killed but there could be ‚Äúrounds in flight‚Äù so to speak)
---
Next wave of BoS are going to stroll in and see this prepped supply cache and think" oh shit, a hostile!" To oh nevermind it's a nobody.  Doesn't matter what Russel says his intentions are. Better hide yo kids, hide yo wife cuz BoS is taking everything!
---
Production vendor in the enclave bunker? Been so long
---
no i LOVE running around some fucked-up, four-story gerbil habitat perched over a cliff that is in NO WAY a trap CAMP the owner's gonna shift two feet over for the lulz just to eventually find he wants 15K caps for a two-star rolling pin
---
i havent seen project red go bankrupt yet.
---
i am all for supporting ongoing development, but look at the difference in quality in 2004 mmo's and games these days. if development really was that expensive. people would be paying ‚Ç¨80,- a month for 1 account on top of a base price.
---
I can't call you scum if I never play NW \*taps forehead\*
---
Thanks - that's correct yup and on the list :)
---
How‚Äôs it pay to win? I can‚Äôt even guess a valid argument here. Do you really need a scrap box to avoid running out of ammo?
---
BUT I WANT WATER ICE!
---
We have two dozen of these, but we need to get this one back on principle, even if you have to kill to do so
---
I only visit it with nukes.
---
Yeah same. I usually don‚Äôt mind putting in about $1/ hour of entertainment and fallout 76 pays out like 4:1 for me at this point even with occasional purchases and FO1
---
Yea, but i can't remember if the guy we're donating too is even a part of the BOS. I thought he was someone who was like "I want to help the BOS so i can be a part of them, let's make this their base"
---
CD projekt Red makes like exclusively single-player games so im not sure that applies.
---
Also who is still paying that much for 76?  I got it for $12 on Amazon over a year ago.
---
‚ÄòBefore the boom boom‚Äô
---
Because the BoS are not who we think they are O.O
---
I have limited game time during the week but figured I'd try and make a donation last night...stayed up too late jumping server after server and still couldn't come up with 250 concrete. If it would have accepted less than the 250 then I could have donated over 100 (I forget just how much I scraped up) but all the sources were dry wherever I went.
---
Bought the game on launch.
---
No Fallout 1st or anything else.
---
\+ 600 hours and still play regularly
---
This is not Destiny. You don't have to keep shelling out.
---
Not 'Fallout 1st only'
---
You have more concrete than you do steel? On the regular? I'd have to check on my Xbox inventory amounts (played from Beta to Wastelanders on Xbox), but on PC (played since Wastelanders) I had about 10k steel and 750 concrete in my scrapbox. Keep in mind not everyone has FO1st either, I really doubt those players are keeping much more than 100 concrete in their stash box.
---
Lots of these aren‚Äôt even currency
---
Poseidon Enengy is the best place to farm cores, just claim the workshop as soon as you log on.   
---
Either the power plant has to be operational, or you have to build a fusion generator (or any number of generators strung together to make 100 power). The workshop itself has resources and if you run the perk card Contractor it costs next to nothing.   
---
You can get tons of cores this way, just periodically go back and check the generator. If PvP is not your bag, I've rarely been attacked and really it takes like 30 seconds to hop servers and claim another workshop.   
---
You can also build a Lead and Nuclear Waste extractor there too.   
---
The fusion cores are always 100%, which if you're farming cores that's what you want (best usage of the weight).
---
Nice.
---
I'm not so sure about rare part
---
Do you turn it in for stuff or other currencies? Congrats, you found a currency.
---
I buy mounted heads if they're priced right. My alts don't all have them.
---
If that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre doing it you should just play nuclear winter. Kills in NW count toward the achievement, that‚Äôs how I got it.
---
Nobody gives a shit.
---
I know, I'm just very bad at it so I try not to play it hahaha
---
Is Atlas in a nukeable area? Know the BOS, they built in a safe zone.
---
Performance and server stability.  Same reason why the new wendigo collossus is instances only.  8 players per instance.  
---
Shelters sound cool.  But it's an extra loading screen and will probably be implemented poorly. I hope I'm wrong.  I just can't see any advantage.
---
Just dont do the events and the brotherhood wont show up
---
I'm with the people who think they just didn't factor the comparative speed most people who wanted could contribute.
---
If even part of that figuring for goals was based on the number of units any given player "owned" on avg without an overall reason to farm them, and a whole lot of folks that enjoy building wouldn't have per se been willing or able to instantly free up the units that went into building their current bases.
---
tbh this is like the 500th issue i have in the past 2 weeks of trying to enjoy the game i told myself attest i can earn some atoms and get the last thing i wanted out of the atom shop, even with the 2 hours filled with bugs and glitches i thought just as long as i can do this...
---
If you grind out the lil events it might.. I'd go to slocum joes and server hop the small events.. o ly to finish off the last little bit of rep I needed I didn't find out about it until I was close to max
---
OK, fair enough I did not comprehend the 'more content than *this game*' that is quite a stretch.
---
it‚Äôs not a matter of having more steel than concrete or vice versa. It‚Äôs enough people having enough concrete to donate.
---
I believe people had enough to donate, but since the rewards for concrete were the same as steel, there was no reason to donate. For many people there was no reason to donate for steel. 
---
my point is more, they know how much materials are sitting in our inventory. Yes a lot of non-first members don‚Äôt have a lot. Then you have the people who duped and are sitting on hundreds of thousands. Then you have the people in the middle.
---
for people like me who have concrete, we still didn‚Äôt donate because the rewards weren‚Äôt worth it. But i only gave a small amount of steel. For that matter, i don‚Äôt plan on donating for any of the rest of these. The rewards aren‚Äôt worth it.
---
Set spawn locations used to be a thing then people with trap camps used it to for evil
---
I'll see your non legends, and raise you a vendor with a 39 stack of some kind of fertilizer? That had a 0 damage and counted as weapons.  I couldn't decide if epic troll or just didn't know. I spent several minutes trying to find the kill toys before noticing.
---
Cups with straws are for plastic, but forgot about the pizza boxes...
---
Looks like the counter is set to 15 million instead of the 150,000,000 they originally called for.
---
Yup. They want to add in some fan service so I‚Äôm fully expecting D.C and 2102 New Vegas.
---
Man, I really want to see that place get nuked
---
It extends disease duration, but the diseases don‚Äôt last forever. You can still cure your diseases. It‚Äôs great for accidentally killing small critters like foxes. It‚Äôs not strong enough to kill anything else.
---
Seriously? You ever thought about that their camp wants to be looked at and explored? I purposely let them run through a maze so they don't miss my collections
---
I donated 500. It's all I had man
---
Damn. I tried to report a workshop once that had 12 ammo collectors and 10 various other collectors that did not match the resources. I gave up after 30 minutes on the Bethesda website/help boxes etc trying to figure out how to report someone. BTW I'm level 144 and I eventually gave up. 
---
I've asked a few other players since if they know how to? You have to be a serious KILLJOY to have figured out the maze to make a report.
---
you rolled a 1. give all your resources to random NPC who will disapear within the month
---
The game grants about 5 random spawn points based on where you initially placed your camp, no amount of moving the camp object seems to change these 5 spawns.
---
It could be really easy, set the output required, then you just dump whatever you have in it, you are given whatever it determined you got in excahnge. That's it....
---
Word up
---
Since Power Armour in 4 and 76 are more like piloted exosuits instead of suits of full plate, I'll bet getting 'x' number of kills while piloting PA qualifies you as an "ace", like combat plane pilots.
---
Don't get me wrong, this game desperately needs some end game group progression content
---
If it isnt client side from the start, it isnt gonna happen later.
---
I'll trade you some oil and a battery if you give me a lift to Crater!
---
I know, the magic PM triangle... and can really imagine how new trainees have been assigned to this task, doing their best in a hopeless situation, like  scooping water with a strainer... but nevertheless I liked the idea of immersion... it helps me to bear this sh\*\*.
---
he isn't a member of the BoS, but is a fan who hopes to join, with building a base for them being a supportive reason
---
How the hell did you come to that conclusion based on my comment to the original post?! Geez...
---
THANK YOU!!!!
---
As they stated from launch, all playable content will be free. That means DLC's and Seasons. So far, they've stood up to that.
---
All 1st is, is pay to convenience. It's nice to have, but it's not a "need". Unless you're really lazy about returning to your CAMP, and/or a hoarder with 8 sets of armor, 10 weapons you don't use, and 1573 stimpaks, Rad Aways, Sugars Honey and 40 mini nukes in your STASH for some really strange reason.
---
The upshot of 1st is mainly the Atoms. You're basically buying 1600 Atoms a month, and getting all the rest of that stuff thrown in for free. But if you're not a hoarder, and have no interest in anything the Atomic Shop has, it's pretty useless.
---
This applies to the Legendary Run as well. It's just all cosmetics and convenience items. If you have no interest in the Atomic Shop, you likely won't in the Legendary Run, either.  
---
Before anyone brings up the Ammo converter: it's pretty pointless (*see what I did there? eh? no..?*). The amount of points you get from conversion is extremely poor. Not worth the time. Unless you *purposely* go out farming every type of ammo in large quantities to feed it. Especially if you use a 5.56 automatic. Seriously, just go to Lucky Hole.
---
As for the non-cosmetic items in the Atomic Shop, the Scrapkit and Repair kit. Again, pay to convenience. There are workbenches literally -everywhere-. Don't be lazy. As for the repair kits, you get spammed with superior ones every time you kill the SBQ.
---
I have 5 characters, i‚Äôm fine with some items being no-drop like in old MMORPGs, I think more things should be no drop
---
&gt;the Ammo Converter is really playing in the champions league of all most user-unfriendly
---
are you [sure](https://uxdesign.cc/the-worst-volume-control-ui-in-the-world-60713dc86950)? :)
---
Nah man i don't think he wanted to brag about this weapon. Keeping in mind how brutally that thing got duped, i thought everyone has one or two laying around by now. But maybe i was wrong there.
---
Angry Turtle on YouTube has some videos on power armor.
---
Thats scarily accurate lol.    I still do it for the inner completionist
---
I agree. By the time that legendary effect is actually usable you're usually already pulling in better rolls.
---
Totally agree!  So disappointing when visiting some vendors.
---
Shame we can't use our Terminal to browse the vendors on the server.
---
+50 dr each piece if you have 10+ mutations. Not many people want that many mutations and vanguards would still be good for not mutant players.
---
PC? I alt F4 and did it again
---
You'll find the mod on a lot of the vendor bots around. I was messing around with the chainsaw on the weekend and just bought the mod to make it easier.
---
‚ÄúI detect no deception in this man; and I will recommend him to my closest associates and family members.‚Äù
---
Ok. I wasn't going to bite but people need to learn.
---
Pay2win by the best, most authoritative definition we have to date make it very clear it's not about the concept of winning (whatever that means for any given game anyhow) but about paying for an advantage over those that don't pay.
---
Sources:
---
"in online gaming, the practice of buying in-game items that give a player a very big advantage over others" - Macmillan Dictionary
---
"In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his or her non-paying peers" - Wikipedia
---
I don't consider Urban Dictionary to be an authoritative source personally but even it too has definitions that concur:
---
"Several games nowadays have the option to pay real money to enhance the experience of the player, often frustrating him unless he pays up  
---
\[...\]  
---
Pay to Win is a situation in gaming \[...\] where companies allow you to buy items or advantages with real money that cannot be obtained normally by playing the game."
---
To be fair UD top definition specifically references winning but if the choice was a dictionary company and Wikipedia over Urban Dictionary, it's pretty much a no brainer which definition is more authoritative.
---
You could question the authoritative nature of any of the above as major dictionary companies haven't adopted a definition. That's fair enough. I'd be more than happy to adopt a better definition from a more authoritative source.
---
To date, no one has been able to do so, so I'm not holding my breath.
---
Until you can come up with a better definition, pay2win is about paying for an advantage, not paying to "win".
---
Mummbles has a legendary arsenal at her disposal now, the molemen will prob have an uprising soon.
---
I think explosive might be what im missing.  I believe i have a 1 point card for explosive but its only 10% with the 1 so really not much of an increase
---
No you don‚Äôt lose the special point or no you can‚Äôt allocate it somewhere else?
---
Fun fact: best Fallout was made not by Beth.
---
After you select where you want the point to go just press whatever your back button is and you can pick a card from a different SPECIAL.
---
Totally agreed on the incentives being incredibly lackluster, between that and the fact the only thing in-game providing any info on this event is the box in the top right corner of the main menu definitely led to less donations.
---
I'm just saying the theory that the goals were based on some report of all players' inventories doesn't make sense to me considering the goals are higher for concrete and cork (and even plastic is suspect honestly).
---
You can keep choosing intelligence perks while adding the point to another special, is no big deal
---
That resets the Queen's health without resetting the quest timer, so that's going to be a fail!
---
Some people also say the repair kits are game changing.  Some people are easily impressed by small things.
---
The first screen is where you select which Special to increase, the next screen is where you chose your Perk, it defaults to the Special you selected but you can cycle left/right (Bumpers on console) to the other Specials.
---
My bad I edited my message I wasn‚Äôt specific really on explaining
---
On the one hand, there are people playing that weren't here last year.
---
On the other hand ... give me new stuff! :-P
---
The problem is mutations are already a buff Ina me of themselves.
---
Wait until Colossal problem drops, that entire event was designed with Bloddied builds and damage output in mind.
---
Very difficult to complete with full health builds.... :-)
---
Its at Atlas. You go to Atlas. You can find instructions at Atlas.
---
We will nuke them. Repeatedly.
---
We know these are all duped to hell and back I was offered 2k large gifts for one of my handmades and honestly I almost took it even knowing they are duped.Are these gifts easily flagged? Bannable?
---
Duping is basically the fact of duplicating stuff in game, either junk, guns, armor, etc. That's what some players do and used to do by forcing a crash, making the server rollback, not before your character you dropped stuff and someone else picked it up and left the server to force a character save, for example. It was pretty common the first weeks post beta
---
K. Bye.
---
Yeah, that was the name of the patch before this too. And the one before that. And the one before that.....
---
Me too. I had 4 vendors crammed with stuff. Now I've got to manually add all that back in with different prices. Honest to god. THIS GAME!
---
I think you are partially right. In that part, where "Interface was made like "consumer product style", with boasting and so on.
---
But i did not think that clumsiness of interface was made on purpose, just to show, satirically, what a bad place Alternative Pre-war America was.
---
When you level up, you first choose which category you want to increase and ***then*** choose which card you want to select. It can be Ina different category, you just need to tab over (RB on Xbox)
---
I was talking about Fallout 1st but sure, if strawmen are your thing, go for it!
---
What is "to prime" in this game?
---
What use so I have for cork anyways?
---
Plus as it's instances with 8 players max, if you and your mate go in as player 9 and 10 you're on your own...and pretty screwed :-)
---
I could see an interesting plot where the enclave returns to reestablish governmental control and suddenly Clay and Singh pop out of a bunker to reestablish the Free States and oppose the attempt to impose a government on the area.
---
Yes your bad. Nuking the main site starts the Queen fight, so you probably reset the fight. Wasting everyone's time and resources. Definitely a dick move
---
You missed off the Survival Tent, it makes a surprising amount of difference.
---
I did mention the tent. It's a free fast travel point. I don't see how it's that big of a help.
---
He has a hat.
---
Scrapbox. Tent. And no griefers in workshops.
---
Mine updated now too! I just was confused for two hours or so.
---
From my cold dead hands!!!!!
---
Still not Pay2Win. It‚Äôs pay for convenience.
---
Agreed!
---
True that but like just 10% on a legendary imo that should be a secondary effect
---
I think it's a military theme as well, lots of C.A.M.P. defense items were datamined weeks ago, so it might be part of the rewards.
---
This is amazing üòª Literally stopped myself from having conversations on this topic because the only defence seems to be relying on semantics.
---
I think Treasure Hunter was much, much worse. The only thing with ATLAS is that it's an event that came out when a few people here have already said they were beginning to feel burnt out on the game and we have the Wendigo event which has been pushed back for months now, on top of a lack of bug fixes and changes to mechanics like double sided walls which were in no way harmful to the majority of the playerbase, it's just bad timing for the event to come out.  
---
I had already decided to take a break from the game for the time being and seeing the rewards from the boxes, I don't really feel compelled to contribute anything especially when ever since the very first Fallout I've not really been that much of a fan of the Brotherhood in general.
---
Okay? Mentioned the scrap box and tent. The scrap box is nice yeah. But again I have never needed it. And the tent is a free fast travel point so what. Also for workshops, what do you need to claim them for? I only ever claim them for the dailys and weeklys
---
Poon Palace
---
Of course you can do that, if you got all the sweet things ingame you were looking for.
---
But to me (finally got my b3325hm‚ù§ yesterday) this armor grind looks more like unrewarding work then fun.
---
Please don't get me wrong, I don't mind grinding - as long as it feels somehow rewarding... also in relation to my playtime, which is more and more restricted, the older I get.
---
That means crafting my 76th nocturnal piece on the 1/5 of a full set would rather push me away from the game than keep me playing.
---
I'm very unhappy with how they implemented the legendary armor/weapon crafting.
---
So I keep playing with my friends and instead of feeling more ripped off from the game than already, I'm saving modules for hopefully exiting/unbroken new weapons. üòÅüëç
---
Theres a massive stash of concrete at the very top of the monorail elevator where there‚Äôs a bunch of plank platforms at the top (some of which collapse when stood on so watch out)
---
Her and also the one at Charleston Fire Station. The Responders have a decent amount of infrastructure about to make a comeback.
---
Winner right here
---
Look at you using weasel words. 
---
So having things be more convenient isn't an advantage, right?
---
Like I said, provide a more authoritative definition, I'll happily go with that.
---
He's related to Ward isn't he?
---
Would you lose your atoms on gamepass or only accumulate them on the launcher you play with?
---
Some Assaultron action shots for your ~~enjoyment~~ nightmares
---
Yes. Picking up more then 1k will get you flagged, but as far I know nothing happened yet. Probably Bethesda don't care about smaller quantities
---
What is the scrip limit again?
---
They said mod support coming, I cant wait for the day one PC mod patch. Hopefully the devs just borrow it and use it to fix xbox too.
---
I agree it‚Äôs not well thought out. I actually think it would make sense as a 3rd effect at 5-10% to be that ‚Äúgod roll‚Äù to put a great gun over the top.
---
Meat piles arnt bad for me, but damn that Tesla with the piles is gg.
---
I acctually liked the tresure hunters event! liked seeing some life in the Ash heap.
---
Yeah, I came across the guy who wanted 250 concrete.
---
I raided everywhere I could and even looted my own stash, best I could come up with was 180, and that was on a 2 hour game play session. I reckon they ought to just make it 50 at a time and then people could actually donate
---
You almost never reply when tagged in Bethesda forums...
---
Having a legendary tab would help, I'm constantly looking for Bloodied items.
---
But way less, Bethesda nerfed the amounts.
---
A few weeks ago you needed about 350-400 to get 30k caps, now its about 450-500.
---
they did inform us about it. not everything is posted to reddit.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423145/fortifying-atlas-concrete-goal-update?language%255B%255D=en

It reminds me of an antique store I don‚Äôt know why but I love that
---
It looks like an antique store to me I don‚Äôt know why but I love that
---
leave the guy alone he doesnt have the contractor perk so it costs him far more to build his camp up than it does us, and whith his likely 200+ friends joining Appalachia he has to supply them as well so they can have nice camps and without contractor it adds up :)
---
With my alts i try and do roleplay builds or less popular builds. Not out to min/max just casual playthroughs. I have a mistress of mysteries character, a mini gun shredder/explosive raider character, and one I'm working on now using auto pistols. My next one will be a civil war reenactor.
---
Fact nothing but factüòÜüëç
---
Wow if I knew this I would have tried to do more yesterday. I gave up a couple days ago when it looked totally useless and didn‚Äôt see they changed it yesterday. Some sort of in-game meter would have been helpful.
---
That's a whole lot of hoop-jumping and thought and effort into something when you could just spend a few bucks a month and call it a day.
---
There is no competition in this game.  There is no end-game progression content with score-boards.  There are no statistics for your character anywhere.  No one can get an advantage over anyone because it's impossible to measure.  If there is no competition how can you have an advantage?
---
Outcasts and Remnants mod for Fallout 4 was pretty good. Not gonna say it's have more content than F76 but you can easily compare this mod with Far Harbor DLC.
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21469](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21469)
---
I like how if you try to use it with power armour you sit down beneath the screen so can't even see what you're doing! Try it... if it's just me I'll post a vid it's hilariously bad.
---
Always? Even in F3? When they stopped the Enclave from using the geck to poison the capital wasteland's water. Or just before F76 started when  "Rather than flee, the soldiers decided to continue manning their posts until the bitter end, trying to buy as much time for Appalachia as possible."
---
Just check over your armor and weapons and keep the junk needed to repair them.
---
Aluminum, lead,  copper, ballistic fiber,  screws, springs, and gears are always good to keep.
---
Lol wow of this is true, Bethesda must be desperate to ‚Äúappease us‚Äù
---
Where‚Äôd do I drop off my concrete
---
In the classed cavern, pick up any Ultracite and you spawn more scorched to kill. If say you go there will someone, they exit and reenter, they'd be able to pick up a unlimited amount of Ultracite from one vain.
---
You don't have to play just one game . Ive been playing world of warcraft since launch 15 years ago. I log in do the current new content then unsub till next patch. Its OK to take breaks and play other things that you enjoy. Ive just recently started f76 and been playing going on 4 weeks. In that time ive put in probably 85 or 90 hours. I see myself playing for a few more months. Then I'm sure I'll take a break and that ok.
---
so just  2 weeks after the content dries up Ill be able to finish the rep on a character i dont care about anymore. Sweet.
---
But it's such a flex to wear that coat now
---
That's fair and very well might be the case so I won't argue that as I have no way of knowing for sure.
---
I still feel like they should buff PA to be more in-line with normal armor though and generally they should try and balance the game in a way where all types of equipment can be as good as the others even if you can still succeed without a problem with all of them now (except for shotguns without vats as far as I know, might be arguable though)
---
I admit it can only become a problem for bosses like the one of the upcoming colossal problem event as the player count is limited and they may add increasingly stronger bosses as the game continues but that could also be solved by just balancing those differently. I just fear that may take out the fun for some people as they'd need to stay just as "easy" as the last one, so I'd prefer gear based balancing.
---
Fortskin
---
Glad i've mistaken then. Anyway they could use other social channels. Its never hurt.
---
I don't know where Atlas is. I'm only level 40 so I'm probably too low to join in or do much good anyway! I had heaps of steel but concrete, not so much.
---
no one likes your faction or your shitty power armour with exposed wiring one good rain storm and it shuts off and that's cannon
---
The problem is not the mounted heads, it is the interface.  I'd rather they hired someone who knew about the 'user interface', or at least has heard the term.
---
I Think hes looking for a team do do things with
---
He just doesn't know how to place it.
---
I hope so... But I gotta say I remember having this same conversation when it first launched.  I think it's probably going to be a while though.
---
Yep. Content vs goal is definitely not balanced. You will HATE the faction rep quests by the end.
---
I always wanted some marker on your UI on a camp you've visited already showing the date. Or give you the ability to mark it, changing it's color on the map for you only. 
---
Also, clothing section instead of having it in armor.
---
I don't even do the daylies cuz I don't enjoy them I just do what I want and I probably have 1500 hours across 3 chars. I do really enjoy making new chars too
---
you guys realize you do the same thing and kidnap people but you wave the American flag infront of it while you poison and kiss people
---
&gt; if strawmen are your thing 
---
&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw\_man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; A **straw man** (sometimes written as **strawman**) is a form of [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_argument) and an [informal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy)  of having the impression of refuting an argument, meanwhile the proper  idea of argument under discussion was not addressed or properly refuted.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#cite_note-Stephen_Downes-1) One who engages in this fallacy is said to be "attacking a straw man".  
---
So you don't know what a strawman argument is? I literally addressed your argument by pointing out repair kits are held to the same standard you are holding the stash box to. That isn't a strawman that is taking the hundreds of thousands of posts complaining about how pay to win repair kits are and pointing to them as an example of people easily impressed by small things.
---
I bought the solar set first.
---
Wish I'd bought the torso and jetpack first. It would have made the grind more fun imo.
---
You are damn close to both so either choice is good!
---
I can, I did, and will keep doing
---
This game was just as much built for solo play as it was teams and the flying mechanics are the exact same as Skyrim‚Äôs. So I‚Äôm going to keep comparing
---
If you do not need something, it did not mean that anyone will not need it.
---
Yes, i heard "nobody need that much of scrap, just learn to manage your inventory". And suddenly - if you just want to make a set of armor for your alt, you found that there are no that much aluminium in your chest. And you will spend time in gathering that very resources you had sold yesterday. The simple convenience of having resources at hand any moment you wish to do crafting cost you $10/month. 
---
And about workshops: look at any conversation about "how to get fusion cores". I have seen this many times: "capture workshop at Power plant" - "You will be attacked, thought".
---
Exactly, it'll take the same time to get them both but I've been convinced to do the Jetpack
---
Cranberry Shortstay
---
Now that you mention it, I don‚Äôt recall getting one except the one talking about the free stuff for Doom Con or whatever it is
---
I absolutely agree.  As a casual player I easily donated somewhere  between 3000-5000 steel.  I spent time running around yesterday and today specifically looking for concrete and I managed to pool 180.  Not even enough to donate once.
---
enclave has no nukes and no air support or real military forces in west Virginia all the brother hood has to do is whipe the hard drive in the white springs bunker and the enclave is gone
---
Yes but we have nukes :)
---
Yep good choice!! I have nearly 1300 hours in the game and I'd give up all my gear I've accumulated to keep the jetpack.
---
You are definitely going to want a few acrobats pieces and a few ap refresh.  Have fun!!
---
Fort Kick-Ass
---
Thanks, hasn't ruined the game but it just cut my motivation to grind for stuff in half. Hopefully they add a fix or return it to how it was soon.
---
Trophy's for everyone!
---
They extorted the locals for resources, technology, and research and squandered it all. Now they want us to give them even more of our hard earned resources so they can come back and extort us some more?
---
What kind of non PA armor do you use to hit these damage threshholds easily? A full set of SS armor only has 247dr and 217er (buttressed), when adding scaly skin you go up to 297dr and 267er, then with grounded you get to 297dr and 367er but not all builds can use it and you are still missing some dr if you don't use perks
---
They have a ton of vault dwellers who at least a few are going to be willing to nuke the Brotherhood to uphold the values of the Enclave. They also have armies of robots and Kovac. 
---
If they did come to fight the Brotherhood would win cause Beth has a giant hardon for the Brotherhood, but y'know
---
no you don't everyone has access so if i can nuke the white springs or whipe out it's hard drives or even shoot them it's over for you all the brotherhood has to do is disable the silos and that's easy
---
Earlier this week everything disappeared from all my display cases.. I assumed they‚Äôd disabled them as before but it appeared to be only my camp affected.
---
So spent time reinstating everything and so far, fingers crossed they have all remained in place.. This is my first experience of this bug.
---
1000
---
It‚Äôs a poorly thought out event, with bad rewards and that combines to create a very negative experience for the player base.
---
I am guessing you mean the ones that randomly spawn in some locations, not the station ones, right?
---
Were they all Junk items that might have been used when crafting?
---
That reminded me of my GPU's software. I have an old 7950 HD radeon and I'm using the crimson radeon thing (which I hate, it's ressource hungry and not user-friendly at all).
---
I decided to disable the ingame Vsync and use the crimson radeon FPS limiter and, guess what? You can't enter the number, you must use the slidebar. I spent nearly 10 mins trying to set both slidebars on 60 but it's just not possible ... it will either be set on 59 or 61.
---
I don't think we get them back, they just disappear. It's bothersome, it forced you to farm for them again.
---
No matter where i camp i never have turrets, i change locations twice + a week, and i never get attacked enough to justify any defences.
---
Watoga High School is filled with books and napkins.
---
we have a gigantic air battleship and robots yes the brotherhood win against a failing organization with no real ideals beside hide in bunker pretend to be government kidnapp people
---
That is not my point or what op is asking though. He asked what's the main difference between those with first and those without.
---
Yes the scrap box is very convenient. But it is 100% not necessary. As I was saying, 1.2k hours in without a scrap box and I do just fine.
---
Also fusion cores? I have never claimed a workshop for fusion cores. You get so many more from doing events than the few an hour you can get from workshops.
---
My point though, is while first is nice for sure. It is not needed at all to enjoy the game.
---
They were junk items yeh, I have plenty of scrap stashed though. It's strange it would auto scrap junk items for display but it could explain why the bug happens.
---
Nuking whitesprings has no effect on the vault hidden deep beneath it, most it would do is collapse the entrance. And if the Brotherhood disables the silos there's still Kovac
---
Well... No, I have to say I was wrong, it was me misreading the lines in the machine, so it works! (my bad), anyway it is annoying to jump from pip boy to ammo converter, intuitive system not at his best.
---
I have one acrobat so far but it's Bolstering and got Bird Bones. Do you use Cushioned on your legs?
---
&gt;If there is no competition how can you have an advantage?
---
I'm surprised this needs to be spelled out but at a bare minimum:
---
Scrapbox
---
* Less time spent on inventory management
---
* Less time spent on junk runs
---
* More storage space in main stash (most people I've seen report freeing up around 400-500)
---
* More free space for vendor items (+caps) or legendaries (+scrip)
---
Also less time on inventory management and junk runs means more time actually playing the game, which in turn means more XP, caps, legendaries and other rare plans and loot for the same time spent.
---
You're a moron if you think none of the above is an advantage. 
---
Caps we can skip cause they're pretty valueless right now but the others are non-trivial advantages with clear benefits - quicker legendary run completion and faster acquisition of legendary perks for the former and more chances at getting god roll legendaries and rare loot to keep or resell for the rest.
---
I haven't even touched on the advantages of the tent and private worlds. Though I get the sense you're going to just blanket deny the evidence regardless.
---
Rewards weren't that big a deal. Granted I'm a casual player, but I gladly donated 3000-5000 steel over a couple of days, regardless of the reward.  It gave me something different to do.
---
It's just not feasible to collect that much concrete in game.
---
Oh..mine we‚Äôre just all back in the stash waiting to be placed again. Completely disappearing items would be terrible, especially having the rare Fashnact masks etc..
---
200 years early my dude. And the Brotherhoods ideals are to kill all non-humans and steal tech sooo... the fo4 brotherhood is only one step better than the fo3 enclave
---
They're fairly plentiful in the 'Adventure' drawers and boxes actually. I know it can be hard to look and not expect to get shot at, but I've scouted areas in Adventure mode and it's helped in NW for that sort of thing.
---
Also, take a screenshot at deployment and see where most people drop in. You'd be surprised at  certain little place being wide open. You'll always get pipe guns innthese containers too...so it gives you anchance if you miss the big crates.
---
if i a "member" walk in and disable him by blasting the reactor you done that's the end of the enclave
---
I moved camp and my teddy bears and Mr fuzzys  disappeared. 
---
How will I sleep tonight?
---
Prob just rub one out tbh!
---
I did until I finally rolled 2 acrobat pieces.  It still doesn't negate all fall damage though.
---
the airships are cannon to fallout 2 boi o also why wouldn't i kill the super mutants and zombies
---
Wow. Your lack of self awareness is astounding...
---
No the station ones. Just check out their 'mods' tab now and then, it's amazing what you find there. I picked up the long low bar and flame mods for the chainsaw off of one on Saturday just so I could try it out. Nice part is it requires nothing to install it either, it's a nice easy package.
---
The only ones I can think of off hand that don't have mods are the ones in the Whitesprings and the one at the Whitesprings station...all the others should have some with ones as you go east on the map away from the forest and lower level areas tending to have better ones.
---
Rule 10
---
Try the market sub
---
dont understand why its not just a vendor interface
---
Is your scrap in your Stash or Scrap Box?
---
Looks like I was pretty close to the truth/balls-up...üòÑ
---
Old news
---
Scrapbox.
---
I would love to have the plasma bullets from FO4 back - and more of this pattern like EMP effect or similar
---
Yeah I think it's 40% for each leg and acrobats is 50% for each one
---
Thankyou !!
---
I personally think setting up prefab camps (because you can easily move them to different resource locations) with resource extractors are more efficient, especially if you loot a lot and FT back to camp to scrap said loot
---
"Explosive rounds hurt. Don't fire point blank unless you really hate yourself and want someone to take all your junk while laughing."
---
Considering the scarcity of certain materials, and the quality of the rewards, the original goal was unachievable.  Just google how many players on Fallout 76 servers, and was surprised just how large the console crowd is.  Console players outnumber PC players by a magnitude. Aprox 25k PC players, 400k console players.  Regardless, with the original goal of 150M, it would take an average of 23 turn ins per player.  That is not possible at the current spawn rate, unless people grind grind grind.  And they wont do that for these rewards.  So its a design issue.
---
That member would have to actually get close enough to do it. Get through the robots and turrets, after getting through the vault door. Becoming a member realistically wouldn't be as easy as it's made out in the game
---
TY
---
I thought that when I ran through the quest. I‚Äôd like the ability to raise the difficulty and do it as a team.
---
&gt; Less time spent on inventory management 
---
But what about if you don't spend any time on iventory management? Junk stash doesn't affect aid, misc or ammo and those are the core problems I run into.
---
&gt; Less time spent on junk runs 
---
The only active junk runs I do is for lead, acid and steel to make 5.56 ammo and 2mm ammo. How can junk stashes reduce the amount of junk runs I need to make that ammo?
---
&gt; More storage space in main stash (most people I've seen report freeing up around 400-500) 
---
I already have a good 100-150 space free in my stash at any given time. So why would I need more?
---
&gt; More free space for vendor items (+caps) or legendaries (+scrip) 
---
I'm already sitting at around 29-30k caps. And I regularly blow though 900 script at least once a month were I drop most of the weapons I get anyways from the vendor. Why do I need more space for vendor or script?
---
Well 7.25$ is the federal minimum wage, most states have an increased minimum wage but some don't, none of them are at 15$ (2020). The only 15$ or higher "minimum wages" are not bound by law but rather set-up on a contract and usually just a company offer to make themselves more attractive but I guess it doesn't matter as I still agree that the atom reward is way too small no matter what "minimum wage" applys
---
Ahhhhh too late for me
---
Happens to me a lot on xbox, I'll be mid swing and it hard crashes.
---
&gt;yea, like how it was done for over 20 years. base game, + expansions.
---
Expansions cost money.
---
You start a new toon and you are at the start of the game!! unbelievably! bethesda needs to sort this out! üòÜ
---
i did it now all i have to do is short out the white springs bunker power grid from the inside
---
How the hell did you have 46k concrete?!? You must pick up everything, and I mean everything. Jebus that's nuts!
---
Running away is an underrated strategy.
---
Holy shit I got home, did the quest AAAAAAAND... 
---
YEP ALL MY SLUDGE VANISHES WHEN I GOT WITHIN A FOOT OF IT. Is this what you're talking about? 
---
Okay so this might be totally fucked now too. Cool. Only the easiest scout badge quest around now gone. Dang it.
---
okay thanks \^\^ I'll be sure to keep an eye on them, do you know whether or not I can also learn the mods by scrapping them?
---
"Don't eat yellow snow"
---
Everyone has probably already shared their thoughts on the other 279 posts on this topic.
---
Well I did get an Xbox live message calling me a dumbass.
---
Whenever a low level comes to my camp and tries to fight me I have give them some time to leave, if they don't I cave their little skulls in with my supersledge.
---
You need a total of 12k points for max rep.  
---
You get 200 points for the daily quests and another 25 points if you play your cards right.  
---
You get 10 points for random encounters.
---
The Overseer daily also gives a few points for the respective faction, but not sure how many that is.
---
Yep
---
That would be pretty fun. Every zombie a 3 star and the last boss being one of the extra strong alpha monsters
---
As a newish player lvl 90 one character only, i like when people sell cheap weapons for me to scrap. Its a lot cheaper buying weapons for 100 or less caps than building then scrapping to learn mods (talking non common drops)
---
&gt;I still feel like they should buff PA to be more in-line with normal armor though and generally they should try and balance the game in a way where all types of equipment can be as good as the others even if you can still succeed without a problem with all of them now (except for shotguns without vats as far as I know, might be arguable though)
---
PA does need more love. This we agree on somewhat. PA could do with some more features and work but I never want it to be an arms race of which one is categorically better over the other.
---
I'd much prefer one to be situationally better than the other. Like PA is superior with tanking damage, using heavy weapons, hard to stagger and surviving in rad zones while normal armour means you have more usable AP, better movement speed, jump height, better weapon accuracy and so on.
---
Doesn't have to be specifically those things but that kind of vibe if you get me.
---
Do you know if ole‚Äô Earl is harder in the instance than when he‚Äôs in the forest? My brother and I beat him by ourselves in the forest, but it wasn‚Äôt super easy. He‚Äôs high health rifles and I‚Äôm bloodied melee.
---
Rockstar games and Bethesda are twins so yeah, fo76 will defo come to next gen
---
It's at the Atlas Observatory.
---
One of the vendors in the Whitesprings can sell them, my memory's hazy but I got the plan either from the Free States or BOS vendor there.
---
I think they will change it to 20m like they did with concrete.
---
Don‚Äôt drink dirty water.
---
Ya, its fine.  One of the best things about this game is the nukes.  Be nice if they'd make adjustments to allow multiple queens to spawn when it occurs.
---
Shit show? It's been a blast for me since day 1
---
I have problems with your wording, as English is not my primary language.
---
What exactly do you mean with "data"? Bandwidth used while playing, filesize you need to download, or the amount of space on the drive?
---
A player can completely ignore this event, and get rewards.  Yet still the internet complains.
---
Oh different Bloodied weapons for heavy, shotgunner, or melee. Also need a couple more SS unyielding pieces but that is entirely on me. Have had surprisingly good luck on that front.
---
Won't 2102 Vegas just be a bunch of tribes fighting for survival? House definitely hasn't stepped in yet. Could be interesting.
---
Most likely
---
I did the quest and FINALLY managed to get the plan form that vendor a second time round. Literally none of the other vendors gave it to me.
---
Or they‚Äôll add a bunch of golf balls and globes in world so there‚Äôs an over abundance.  Lol
---
Best NW challenge yet.  I've really grown to hate that part of the game.  Just not for me.
---
Yeah I like your sentiment, that's also why I suggest Power armor specific legendary effects to cater to tanking and heavy weapons rather than adding the normal ones in the standalone comment I posted, I think power armor makes sense to be slow (not to a degree where it gets annoying though) bulky but tanky while normal armor should allow more agilty/movement
---
Honestly I'm not sure...I believe you can learn the mods from scrapping them but with only a couple of mods available I'm not sure how long it would take. There are a few places in the world where it spawns - the most common being the ranger station and the mountainside B&amp;B.
---
I would say you want the double bar and flame mods for the most damage though.
---
I played around with it on the weekend...it's a lot of fun but really not all that great against any higher level enemies, just too little damage. I really wish they'd make it a proper weapon up to level 50 and higher damage.
---
I contributed 10k concrete i feel proud now
---
That terminal about the malfunctioning nannybot is hilarious.
---
Not seeing any arguments actually addressing my point. Though I suppose I shouldn't be surprised as people like you rarely ever actually address counter points preferring to deflect away from having to defend their point.
---
If they do, you all know what to do...
---
I dont think so, I have 3x as much cork as concrete, steel was like 20x
---
Played since BETA, have been playing NW since it‚Äôs release and have been playing it regularly. I have more fun in NW than in ADV.
---
Could be that! Pulls from Stash first.
---
Meh it's fallout the challenges can be silly and fun
---
Instigating lever action all day.
---
That's pretty much how I play.  Placing anywhere up to 2nd place team is fairly common.  Its that last spot that's difficult, because its filled with a team who actively explore, and are outfitted to the gills.  I have a snow ball's chance in hell of kill that team.
---
When you went to fix/craft something, you were short on screws and hit the "Tag for Search" button.
---
thank you
---
And junk/scrap dumping.
---
Fort Garvey
---
Instead of rain it‚Äôll be golf balls. Lol
---
As an avid player I‚Äôd have to disagree. At this point half my eliminations in a match come from the bush wookies lol most I‚Äôve found in one single bush was four
---
Nah. Stay salty though lol
---
Bethesda should make that into a random event
---
From the interview it didn‚Äôt sound like it be a new zone... just one off mission area we off at other locations
---
Yes I do, and I laughed at how much I had.  It's how the hoarder mind works...I'm going to need that..and..that, oh and this too. 
---
Most people look first for the  player vendors that are selling weapons and armor.  When a hoarder logs on they see that a vendor is selling 2000 junk and they think ooohh...jackpot!
---
Huh?
---
I have been regularly checking all spawn locations of the chainsaw, I usually get 2-3/day but I have only ever gotten one mod from it so it's been tough.
---
Yeah my goal is also the double bar and flame mods, may I ask what damage you got it up to, I can't really compare rn but with no mods I can get it up to 5dmg/hit as a maximum so I am hopeful for the mods, especially the flame one to rack that up quite a bit
---
I hope there's more awards as I've earned everything in that Raid. Solar Armor, Strangler Heart, Photo mode pose &amp; Frames, Vault 94 Icons &amp; Vault 94 Emote.
---
It's called reappropriating, not stealing.
---
where did you hear this?
---
Chad.
---
Oddly enough, one of my chars has a camp where she always spawns in exactly the same spot, facing the same direction. None of my other chars do this.
---
My camps are trash though, placed purely for convenience and efficiency based on my farm loops. So theres no decorations ore frills. Pure minimalism.
---
We can only hope sister. One day :)
---
I think it's good for Bethesda to have such a sad trombone moment. Hopefully they'll regroup and make some changes, and the next idea will be better than 'put all your resources in the BOS garbage can'. Jesus Beth what were you thinking.
---
Man I just could not bring myself to grind for the emote
---
I know what your saying to say is wrong but let pretend it isn't.
---
You get concrete easily, only now is concrete very has been considered rare,
---
Its clear from the stupid high numbers that the idea is we also donate from what we have. People a lot of people with tons of concrete want to keep it for their own reason or don't want to simply lose what is now considered rarer than flux. 
---
However sorry the reason isn't how do we grind 145m concrete, I doubt all the steel was gained via grinding. People don't want to donate for community rewards, if the flag was something else like a stripper hole then maybe or if it was a plan found in the donor boxes.
---
I was willing to grind all the way to the end, but it is so time consuming for me to do legendary run and reputation quests/bullion grinding for 3 characters that I've decided to buy the final 10 legendary run ranks. Next season I won't even try to complete.
---
Go into the junk tab on pipboy and you'll see the option for component view at the bottom. You tag/untag in that interface.
---
You can't have non-protected and non-instanced NPCs, people would just troll the shit out of servers so you never do missions.
---
Yes I think they will
---
This is my plan.  At 82 now.  Once done, I'm taking a break to play other games that have just released or are scheduled to drop this fall.  I'm sure I'll be back when there's another big content/story DLC like wastelanders... but right now the grind just isn't doing it.
---
i call it acquisition of technology
---
I didn't see this news so a link to the info would be appreciated.
---
Vault 94 was the best damn piece of content we ever had.  Removing it was the end of end-game group progression content in Appalachia.  I am skeptical it will ever return and I think making the vaults explorable "the old way" is kind of a waste because after the 1st time in there what is the incentive to go back?  In the other fallout games, vaults were cool dungeons with nice backstory and lore but after doing it once I never went back.  
---
Vault 94 has been the one vault in the Fallout series that I have spent the most amount of time in and had the most fun in.  So hopefully if they make vaults able to be explored "the old way" that we also get an option to raid them with a group doing difficult progression runs for rewards that can only be obtained by doing the raids.
---
M O D U S
---
also take note that it's not "collect 7600 wood" as in collect x amount of the material but "use the 'collect' action x times" so you have to gather wood 7600 times....fun!
---
I think they briefly covered this during 1 of their streans Quakecon from home. Patch 22or so they say will bring back Vault 94 with a twist.
---
OH my god the SS unyealding rolls.   
---
First i did the chest, in three rolls i got a 3\*Uny - Sentinels - AP refresh,   
---
Then i got the left arm, 5 tries 3\*Uny - 20%Junk weight reduction Ap refresh   
---
Then i got the right arm .......  
---
That god damn right arm i have rolled a total of 129 times, for a total of one 1\* Uny   
---
I have bought the rest of the set but i refuse to roll till i have that right arm with something i want.  I have prayed to Mothman, Zetans, Atom, Huboligists and all for nothing. I swear i'm going to go to the Vault and take PITA hostage and demand the secret service to give me a full set of Uny - sentinels - APrefresh  SS armor, and while the are at it 1.000.000 gold bullion, why do they need all that?
---
I'd love for there to be a community photo comp where the winner(s) get to have their photo included into everyone's load screen, at least for a period of time.
---
There was a post here that says a lot of info about Bethesda quakecon for Fallout 76, with the re opening of vault 94 to explore, not just raid.
---
3 star Good With Salt makes food items last 90% longer. But if you‚Äôre grinding the event, your prime meats will last between events. Also, this perk does not stack with the cooler back pack.
---
And no, perks do not affect coolers. food items in any cooler only last 50% longer.
---
From top of the world follow the tracks north on the map and you'll see a domed structure that looks like an observatory - that's the Atlas. 
---
Take a walk up there and you can see what the event is all about.
---
Then you can promptly tell the fanboy to go bugger off 'cause the BoS isn't welcome anymore! - like many of the rest of us :-)
---
Is there any Free States left to return? All those broken bunkers led me to believe they all got wiped out. Seemed ironic that a bunch of survival preppers were among the first to die out.
---
Link?
---
That would be hilarious.
---
The best way I‚Äôve found to beat it is one person be the conduit get some shots off on the robot then hide while the rest of the people shoot away and keep the conduit alive. What do you play on I was able to stay alive the whole time with my new character at level 20 obviously not doing a lot of damage but able to keep bloodies and stronger players alive just dodging and weaving.

Guess you hate the brotherhood of steel
---
Go ham on XP boosters (sleep, cranberry relish, Inspirational perk etc.), join Building team and do a lot of quests, events and high XP areas (mostly high level super mutants and ghouls).
---
One of the things that puzzled me about the ammo converter was that if they'd wanted to they could have had the same functionality (giving ammo points for unwanted ammo) with any of the vendor bots or they could have altered the functionality of a legendary exchange machine and call it Ammo Exchange, you deposit whatever ammo you don't want and you're given ammo points in exchange and you go to the ammo vending machine (located at most train stations) to buy your new ammo with your points. 
---
But I guess they wanted to give the player an award of some kind and they chose to go with the current device.

You should be able to hold the back button to exit

Report the wendigo for unsportsmanlike behavior.   Sorry, it was 2 am, bad joke.
---
Thankfully I have a full unyielding, unmatched,  set to keep me happy until I roll the last 2 pieces of SS, which ironically are both the right arm and leg. I am not super picky on the major and minor effects, thankfully.
---
As long there is one guy with a good build it shouldnt be a problem i can kill the thing in like 8 seconds with a commando build if not faster i would try it with a team as long if there is one guy who tanks being conduit its really easy
---
Waiting for the post where some Bethesda chimp tries to explain how this was somehow reducing server stability and unfortunately had to be patched.
---
Who then claims how, in unrelated news, there is a new text pack in the atom shop with unlimited lettering! Pls buy now!
---
Ture but thay did have bunkes maybe some worked n are hidden or form other states ohio ?idk theres ways to right it in maybe other members come looking for them

Reclaiming technology for the safety and preservation of mankind?

I think that's a great idea. Include the name of the contributor and it would give the community a little morale boost.
---
Simple things like this could really help get some measure of goodwill back.
---
my contribution;
---
" Think you're safe on that rooftop from the molerat? Think again."
---
Play Radiation Rumble and get tags on all the enemies. When I do that event in a building team if I cover one side by myself I tend to get 1.5 to 2 levels out of it, and I'm lvl 130 right now.
---
It's 180 items to refresh
---
High intelligence, intelligence team building, brain fungus soup increases intelligence, cranberry relish and beef stew increases xp. Some armor increases intelligence.  Different mobs give more xp than others. Super mutants being some of the best.
---
The higher your intelligence stat the more xp you earn, So max your intelligence at 15. Then on top of that use mutations like egghead for more intelligence. Join a building team for more xp and make sure strange in numbers perk is being used or shared as this boosts mutations. If you are a low health or bloodied build use unyielding armour, again from intelligence boost. Then on top of all that its sleeping, eating and path to enlightenment for more xp boosts. Think thats the best way.
---
you people blow eachother up daily with nukes i think I'm in the right here
---
Check out angryturtle on youtube. He shows and explains very well how and what to do. It helped me alot, and i can now manage to have all 3 conduits and be alive throughout the entire event, if im careful enough
---
Yup, it‚Äôs obvious they haven‚Äôt been around too long, frog legs isn‚Äôt even a problem as there are other things in this game mode that are actually worth complaining about. (Like spawning in at the same time for example) Some people are really blaming OTHER people‚Äôs perk cards for ~~sucking~~ getting eliminated. No wonder ZAX is always disappointed.
---
Welp that sounds dreadfully boring.  One and done for the vaults then no replay-ability in the content.  Such a shame.
---
They'll lower the goal like they did with the concrete
---
And then they lose it 5 min later when they use Radaway.
---
You shall ride eternal. Shiny, and chrome!
---
YEah i have a set of mismatch pieces, but want a full set of SS.
---
I see the transition, death by poison puts you into a knockdown state and then transitions over to respawn within a couple of frames. And I've also seen an instant respawn like OP mentioned many times
---
Get on a Public Team; preferably Building or Events.
---
Equip Inspirational Perk under Charisma.
---
Eat XP boosting foods like Cranberry Relish or Canned Meat Stew (the reward from "Feed the People" event)
---
Pop Mentats and other INT boosting Foods/Drinks when you're taking on mobs or high level enemies.
---
Get the Egghead Mutation.
---
Always do "Path to Enlightenment" event when you can.
---
Sleep in a Bed, or sit at Communal Fire Pit to get "Well Rested" bonus.
---
Use Lunchboxes, preferably at times where you're going to be getting a lot of XP to take full advantage of it.
---
Events, events, events. Especially if other people are already there. You can be tardy to the party and still get completion XP just for showing up while it's active. Don't be a dick though, try and help.
---
Not the best way, but you can gather an absolute shit ton of Wood and Dirty Water and boil it all.
---
The Forest photo challenge asks you to take pictures at specific (and different, so no spamming the photo button) locations, unlike the ones in other regions.
---
 
---
If you select the challenge a new window with the various locations should open and tell you which will register.
---
Its definitely not an Agent of the Enclave collecting materials from naive vaulters so we can finish construction of our Liberty Prime Colossus and lay waste to all who oppose us.

*Definitely not.*

---
You can't buy bulk cork? I thought the robot at artisan's corner at the ws resort sold that? Could be wrong of course
---
I think the site was screwed up and didn't update to the proper goal. I just checked and it's 15 million and it's almost met.
---
Yeah, on my Watelanders character I only had like 228 concrete scrap. So I went to the bridge in the forest and pick those up and turned in my 250. I got some booze and 2 stimpaks.
---
Ok so is it collectively 180 items that you need to loot or just 180 items at that location on the server, I.e. what other people pick up too?
---
I've been playing since the Beta, and have over 1k of each material I accumulated on mules characters and now in my Scrap box and when I went to donate concrete only had 700, so in my time of always picking up and scraping. There's definitely a lack of it.
---
I leave all mine unlocked. I get tons from events.
---
Any update? Its very frustrating, me and my friend have new characters (him playing for the first time) and nothing in this thread works for us. Both playing on PC, one with steam and one with game pass. This quest locks out SOOO much content for us. I have a support ticket also, but still waiting for any kind of reply (3 days now).
---

What do you think about it if they‚Äôre going to be the same gifts this year they‚Äôre just gonna change what‚Äôs in them and the people that have hundreds of thousands of gifts are going to open them and get all the new stuff so it‚Äôs just gonna be in the same position we are now because prior they didn‚Äôt have the floater grenades and now they‚Äôre adding those you didn‚Äôt get grenades at all and now if you open 100 of them you have 20 of each grenade
---
Typical brotherhood propaganda.
---
I want Kent Connelly to show up and be the OoM‚Äôs ‚ÄúQ-branch‚Äù type guy
---
I've never found "Water Farming" for Caps to be worth it in this game compared to FO4. I've always left them unlocked, if someone wants to take them, they can.
---
What would be perfect is if they turned up and looked at the base and decided..."nah, it's not very good...I think we'll set up over at that airport in Morgantown instead...you really screwed up our proposed base random local person! Go away!"
---
I thought that, but I spent an hour and a half to get just 23 cork.
---
So if you have junk being displayed it can take that for crafting? That‚Äôs messed up lol what about if you have junk for sale in your vendor? Does it take from their too? I wouldn‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt display junk(I know, teddy bears and stuff) nor do I sell it.
---
Thanks!!!
---
Maybe you don't understand, is optional there will be raid and explore options. Even beause they say will be "Fun", and they know that this raid could be really interesting
---
Very late
---
I have 10 of the smaller water purifiers, and they are all unlocked. 20 purified water lasts me a long time and caps are easy so I don‚Äôt worry about selling it. Plus I don‚Äôt make trips back to collect it, so they just sit there full half the time.
---
Anyone who needs water or 100 easy caps can have at it.
---
I figured
---
It is a way to modify the receiver on a gun.  Every gun has a prime receiver plan.  The receiver deals optimal damage and bonus damage to scorched beasts and scorched.  Prime guns use ultracite ammo which uses ultracite and stable flux to make.
---
the faction interiors are instanced.. why cant I kill them all and burn that bridge if I want to?
---
They changed the numbers, it's not going to fail anymore
---
They did have a spawn point like Fallout 4 in the game briefly (It's been awhile and I may be mistaken but I distinctly remember placing a fast travel mat in my first few CAMPS so I'd appear right by my work benches) but, I believe this was removed not long before they implemented player vending machines out of the fear that some players would  place their CAMPs spawn points someplace that was inhospitable to player health. 
---
The also changed the Cap stashes to container very early in the game's life as some players were duping the stashes (they were the Fallout 4 style cap stashes where you'd just pick up a stash).
---
They had a few Fallout 4 style designs and flourishes in the game at launch (or BETA) but they were either removed or severely altered because of player behavior.
---
Tried all vendors in White springs and found nothing. Of course someone could have beat me to it.
---
They‚Äôre Bethesda‚Äôs Ultramarines
---
This. Those common plans do sell, especially if cheap. Even the mounted heads. Some people are new, and weren‚Äôt around. They‚Äôll pay 5 caps for a mounted sting wing.
---
Lots of good points.  For Bethesda to do the exact opposite.
---
3*? Nope here's your 1* shovel
---
Have you tried purchasing additional atoms from the shop? Beth usually recommends this as an immediate fix
---
  "It's a very different experience than the old version, but it's "really fun". "
---
That's what they said.  It's a very different experience.  no where did they say that it was going to be end-game group progression content which this game actually needs.  
---
Their definition of "really fun" and my definition differ quite a bit I am sure.
---
Also it's really weird when you make a post asking for people's opinions and then down-vote them for disagreeing with you.
---
What did you do to hit 5 dmg if I may ask? The base it normally has is 2.
---
I believe the flame mod added like 24 flame damage (which does add up considering how fast it hits), I don't know how much the double bar one adds as the other mod I had was long low bar with added bleeding damage.
---
I totally agree. My favorite quests are from the Free States and Responders. But even if Bethesda doesn't make Free States to return why don't we make them? Why players that wants them back, join forces and make a community in the game. Like near the bunkers. A mix Free States with Scrap Town feeling? A bit like Harpers Ferry. Maybe would catch Bethesda attention. What all think?
---
I'd be interesting to see if the Nuke locations change towards Atlas‚Ä¶
---
It‚Äôs hard to find enough concrete, cork, or any of the other goals for this task, except steel. Especially with the scrapper perk. People kept/duped a buttload of steel since it‚Äôs used for base construction, and weapon and armor construction/modding/repair.
---
Believe or believe not, he give good hatten.  [https://youtu.be/fgdfcKtRQW8](https://youtu.be/fgdfcKtRQW8)
---
Lmfao it‚Äôs almost like the people that come up with these events dont even play the game!! ‚ÄúAh yeah cork is easy 200M let‚Äôs go!!‚Äù
---
Yes.
---
it works, you can easily test it by killing something without it, then killing the same type of thing with it
---
The people with their thousands of duped presents drop plans all over by the hundreds. All this would do is give dupers even more money. Meanwhile innocent people or old timers in the game had to get rid of them (because they weigh too much) and get screwed yet again...
---
It would be nice if they would sell the plans they buy too. Back before scripts I was able to pick up some decent legendaries at the vendors, it would nice to be able to do that with rare-ish plans.
---
I have 3 and leave one unlocked. I‚Äôm a bit generous, not too much though.
---
Scrap Box is out main source of sustenance
---
I expect the same with cork and any others we may not get close enough to. Bring down the goal to somewhere closer than we are and I speculate that they'll fudge the figures even if we miss the goal just so they can brag about how successful and active the community is during their next reporting cycle.
---
Same. Honestly if this wasn't space themed I'd have quit after getting the chicken coop. But I want the rank 99 reward.
---
Might not compete next season unless leveling up isn't a task
---
- SS Arms Buttressed 53 DR and 53 ER x2= 106 DR and 106 ER
---
- SS Legs Buttressed 53 DR and 53 ER x2= 106 DR and 106 ER
---
- SS Chest Buttressed 115 DR and 85 ER
---
- Scaly Skin Mutation 50 DR and 50 ER
---
That's already 377 DR and 347 ER without taking into account Ground Mutation,your choice of either Armor-plated or Insulated Backpack, and if your going to use either Vanguard, Bolstering or Mutant Armor Pieces.
---
I leave mine unlocked because I find most others leave their unlocked. Spending five minutes hopping from camp to camp nets me more water in five minutes than sitting in my own camp collecting.
---
Teamwork makes the dream work‚Ñ¢
---
I‚Äôd be down for it. Would really be interested to see how all the competing factions would interact. Seems like there should be more tension in Appalachia.
---
I like how the mouth breathing simpletons around here automatically assume that excavator armor = noob and try to assume some haughty air of superiority over people who wear it.
---
Its the best gathering armor in the game. Of fucking course people are going to want to use it on their farming runs. Its not like anything is a challenging enough in the game to actually require better defenses.
---
Same and am down ik theirs some groups on ps4 but not much luck with any on xbox
---
Wasn't that we weren't active, it's just that they chose one of the worst materials to grind
---
Only ~150 years early then? All super mutants including the more intelligent ones. Non-feral ghouls. Synths etc. The Enclaves virus were to take out all horribly irradiated humans, small difference from what the Brotherhood wants, really
---
Your not wrong.  I only have 5300 in my scrap box and I've been farming junk since day one
---
Wanna request Uber to the Crater ?
---
&gt;You're a moron if you think none of the above is an advantage.
---
It's not an advantage if there is no competition.  You don't need that much junk.  You don't need that much space.  We survived with half the stash space and no 1st before.  
---
As long as we are insulting people though, you're just one of the many people who wants the benefits from first but doesn't want to pay for it and wants all of it for free.  Go out and get a paper route and get a few bucks a month and stop whining because 1st isn't going anywhere.  If anything it's only going to get more benefits.
---
Thats because sometimes you won't get the few frames to see, since that's only occures if you survive the first tick.
---
You have a certain amount of damage to take once you are knocked to get yourself dead, just think about pvp. Mobs won't finish you since you are dead for them once downed.
---
If you ever used a pre nerfed strangler heart or gnasher grenade you will notice how op poison damage is without resistance, and depending on how strong the individual ticks are you will most likely be killed straight from the first tick which occurs instantly after knock state or see the few frames between the first and further ticks. They count pretty fast, back in the days I killed mobs with my strangler heart just by standing near them.
---
I saw this yesterday, some guy had over 100 weapons in the vend.
---
I shit myself and immediately fast traveled.
---
Talk about disappointment.
---
I'm on pc. Would be fun if there's one in each platform so we can trade experiences.
---
Yeah that is what I am talking about.  From a distance you can see it and then as you approach it just vanishes but the dot stays.
---
So after roughly 20 server hops last night and two this morning I still can't do the quest.
---
Are you sure you took those pictures in the exact 20 locations that it asks you too in the sub challenge?
---
I know, still have below 2k of collects :(
---
I've been firing up Abandoned Bog Towns.  I've yet to see a server where they're active and producing concrete.
---
Judging by what they are saying, that is what is happening.
---
GOD DAMN IT JOSH, THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS.
---
its turbo fert? its used to instantly grow crops like a grenade but of fertilizer.
---
So, why doesn't it show?
---
He put that perk card on yesterday, that's why we need so much less concrete now.
---
I don't go camp hopping but I usually do check a camp I travel to because I tend to leave my water back at camp like a doofus, so seeing I can snag some quick water rather than having to go back or hope I can find a stash box is pretty nice.
---
How do you know this info?
---
I have 3 large purifiers in my camp. Before FO1st started and before teams were a thing I had a mule account I would play simultaneously as my main. 
---
This way I was able to get all the team perk benefits and also leave a character in my camp to collect water and crops every few minutes. 15 water every few minutes adds up pretty quickly and I max out my vendor caps just on water alone
---
I never had much steel stuff in camp.
---
Mostly armour for me.  With white knight perk I don't break much armor.  So I had a bit of steel
---
There are already mods on pc. They do all sorts of things but just on the users end like change sounds, graphics,  make certain things glow to easier see. It'll be that kind of support. They won't let us change some things im sure.
---
Well, have a nice cake day.
---
If they have more than 5 plans I just assume they are known already to me
---
Ok so based off this, I don‚Äôt need to loot the stuff in a specific location. It could be a random 180 things from anywhere on the map correct?
---
Intelligence is directly correlated to XP for whatever reason
---
- Become a low health build with all Unyielding armor (+15 to INT)
---
- Join a Building team and fully bond (+4 to INT)
---
- Run with the Herd Mentality mutation and the Strange in Numbers perk (+3 to INT)
---
- Boost stats with food, e.g. Cranberry Relish (varied +% to INT)
---
- Open lunchboxes with group when running big events (varied +% up to 100% XP)
---
- Farm Super Mutants, ghouls, scorched, etc in the higher level large groups (SBQ, LITS, West Tek, Club house, etc.)
---
Even if you're not a "bloodied" build, the INT boost from running low health adds up quick, and if teamed up the synergy between mutations, perks and team bonus will get you leveling up nicely
---
I've got to bust that place again lol
---
It's almost as if they didn't KNOW that when they set the goals...
---
Why?
---
Yeah. I haven't been playing a lot, but for a regular player to try and collect that much concrete in a short session is hard. I'd love to contribute but it's just a tall order. I respect the players with the time and ability to grind this resource.
---
‚ÄúBecause of the plethora of bugs in this game, most of these tips are useless.‚Äù
---
Do it for science. You need at least a thousand tapes though. So you can do 100 per tower. We look forward to your detailed report.
---
It would check out communities of Appalachia on YouTube it talks about a few of them but most ps4
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt play their own game at all. 
---
For all we know, completing the main quest line will auto flag you for execution by the Brotherhood and the xpac was doomed from the start. 
---
PS: I don‚Äôt follow any lore and I have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
eso voy hacer hermano solamente el juego y listo
---
Best thing we might get is one or two generic voicelines about our desicion, but only when this npcs are inside a instance.
---
We already see the lack of care from Bethesda when choosing the opposite fraction or take all the gold, even if we reach max rep they bitch about us.
---
Damn. I'll check my server when I get home. But it could just be nobody sells it.
---
I just want to kill them..
---
&gt; Wasn't that we weren't active 
---
We don't know either way because Bethesda doesn't release live stats. There's absolutely no way of knowing if the community actually collected all the junk that Bethesda said we did or that they augmented the figures.
---
Also bear in mind that we went from 4m concrete over 2 days to jumping to over triple that a day later. Not saying it's not possible but it certainly looks suspect.
---
Looks a crabman for me, lol.
---
I can't wait as I never got to explore those vaults.
---
Really wish we had stats so we could truly say what we have under our belt. PS4 player here. I would love to see the consoles‚Äô communities participate in NW trials together...and destroy one another
---
some people will always cry 'hacker' when they get beat just because they don't want to admit they got beat fair and square.
---
In FO4, I made a base near the crashed remains of the BoS blimp that had a shop called that, selling "gently used" BoS items lol
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/mswWV
---
I'm pretty sure they gonna snatch wards osmosis kit and water cooled bonesaw.  Cannt have that tech out in the world amongst the common rabble.
---
yep :D
---
I always spawn in the same place it it is way outside of my build area. I have noticed the same with people coming to my camp. My CAMP item is right at the same edge.
---
current brotherhood doesn't want technology also they lowered the amount of concrete we needed it was a bug it's 15mill
---
Switch them to no windows. Place wall paper. Switch back to windows
---
I don't even bother looting them from her anymore. You'll get so so so many of them from the fight that there's no need to waste your stash or vendor space trying to sell them. I was picking them up and selling them for 5-10 caps a piece but even then no one wanted them!
---
Not true. It's 10% chance at a Nuked Assault Random Encounter location.
---
Finally. Someone to buy all my thousands of Mole Miner Gauntlet plans.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. See I try to be the conduit but my health drains so fast when I‚Äôm all 3 of them. And it seems as if it Agros you as the conduit.
---
The plan all along was to have the same people in NW fight each other continuously...It is a vault experiment after all.
---
Bethesda.
---
In a game like 76 you can‚Äôt really have consequences for your actions, it just wouldn‚Äôt pan out.
---
Verrrry late.
---
That's not very nice.
---
I try to be the conduit tank but I feel like I can never survive long enough to make any real progress.
---
I‚Äôm in the mid 80‚Äôs now and due for a break as well. Gonna see how close I get to 90 after today‚Äôs weeklys update. May just buy the last ten levels. Planning a break either way when the Kingdoms of Amalur remastered comes out on September 8th.
---
I have all metal walls in my camp, but I mostly use it for weapon/ armor mods and repair.. I have the scrapper perk card on, and while doing events like ‚Äúline in the sand‚Äù, ‚Äúradiation rumble‚Äù, or ‚Äúuranium fever‚Äù can net 1.5k-3k steel each run if you pick up all of the items
---
Would be cool if it removed the negative effects that class freak does not.  Or some malformed of that. Maybe make it synergism with mutants armor is too. Stack amor and weapon damage the more mutant armor/weapons used
---
&gt;for something we have 0 concrete info on 
---
Cant tell if intentional piss take at the "alleged" Mass Concrete Counterfeit going on or not. Either way I got a good laugh off it üòÜ
---
Another option I was thinking the other day is you set the spawn but it is outside of the build radius. I would like people to spawn on the road to approach my camp.
---
Even that is still exploitable though.
---
Thank you. Hopefully it gets fixed today though. Already had to do a ton of BS to get the fort to work and I just built a solid square for my first go at it.
---
Good on you. Don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôre being downvoted. I‚Äôm sure that person would appreciate it.
---
I'm never sure if the vendor hasn't loaded yet or if it's empty. I wish the empty ones weren't accessible. For the last couple months sometimes vendors take ages to show the items in them or never show at all when there is stuff in them. It's been very frustrating.
---
there‚Äôs a lot of perks and benefits that don‚Äôt show, squad maneuvers, bodyguards, etc.  
---
Herd mentality is a mutation vs a perk, who knows
---
I wouldn't hold your breath man
---
&gt; I would not be surprised if they found out about all of the enclave sponsored nuking, and is on their way out to shut it down.
---
TBH, I would LOVE if it ended up that, if we want to run silos, there's a squad of BoS outside you have to either talk or fight your way through before you even get into the silo. That would definitely add some extra fun for those of us that run silos \*all\* the time. And by all the time, I mean up to 9 silos a day. It just starts getting tedious after a while.
---
I believe the Sutton Station vendor sells it.
---
They already changing water and food. And ammo is plentiful already. You can also equip the card to find more ammo and another to make more ammo when crafting.
---
This.  It just wouldn't work and if they tried it do you really trust them to implement it well?
---
Witnessed
---
Free States for life, brother. They're probably my favorite faction introduced by Fallout now.
---
Lol, I put the drum set beside her guitar in my camp but she just ignores it. I guess they can‚Äôt use other instruments. I want to put together a band!
---
Ever think of checking the sub before posting?
---
Lol don‚Äôt worry I won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm a day 1 player. I‚Äôve learned my lesson in expectations.
---
Whats your platform?
---
Crafting will guarantee SS.  If you are rolling for SS all the time what are the chances the RNG gods will actually bless you with SS?  I tend to get nocturnal wood all the time üòâ
---
Which mat are you using?
---
All this talk of most hated enemies and no mention of Wendigos.  
---
Wendigos suck
---
I do that with them events too.  Good steel n wood
---
I'm not downvote you, probably  someone else, not me I'm sure
---
All seems like solid ideas, I‚Äôd even be fine if script was a slightly larger than would be weekly pool so I don‚Äôt have to scrip daily to get keep up.
---
Only things I wouldn‚Äôt be sure about is that treasury notes I think are going to have plenty of ways to get it once colossal problem is out, unless they plan to increase the daily quota. And 3*‚Äôs reform I know sounds more logical on paper, but there‚Äôs things such as SBQ that I question how guaranteed 3* gear would work. Players already can melt her in under a minute so being able to launch nukes and farm her seems like just another mechanic to make the endgame boss purely another form of grinding. I‚Äôd rather just see a rework of prefix perks so that all legendary perks could are usable. Nocturnal could be a fun build but it‚Äôs pretty useless rn. When there‚Äôs only a handful of viable builds, it‚Äôs not that 3*‚Äôs are rare. It‚Äôs just that everyone is fighting over the same subset of weapons.
---
always seem to drop disappointing loot too.
---
I only leech my water from purifier while I jump around for vendors.
---
Almost every camp has at least one unlocked, the amount where every one is unlocked feels equal to these who lock everything.
---
When someone had at least one unlocked and is in his camp, ill drop some antibiotics, healing salves or radshield for them. I love it to be allowed to supply my water from fellow wastelanders since I can't put purifier myself due the campbudget.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll have to check it out. I was just getting frustrated cause I‚Äôve probably tried it like 10 times with no luck
---
No, it has been 150mil for 4 days. It wasn meant to be 150mil, the devs lowered it after we all complained and saw how pathetic our 4 mil was. Check the actually events page, it tells you what all the plans for the event are and how much was needed for them.
---
I would LOVE some OoM attention. Hands down my favorite storyline in the game. I still wear the Veil of Secrets. If they put OoM stuff in the Atom shop I would scrap as much of my C.A.M.P. as I had to in order to build it all.
---
Exactly, so write new ones that aren‚Äôt useless.  Let‚Äôs be positive.
---
Found it twice hanging out in the pool area at Overlook cabin.   
---
Last time was when I fast traveled to a player camp and it was floating around there.    I think this was in the savage divide mountains. 
---
Have also seen it at the house that looks like a castle in a Berkeley Springs.   He was on the turret at the very top.
---
First time I found him was just outside of Abbie‚Äôs bunker.   
---
Like others have said Queen of the Hunt can sometimes spawn him.   Found him a few times doing that as well.
---
When you leave the instance and load into a new one, there is a chance they revert to no wallpaper. Happens at my camp all the time.
---
I have been playing since release. They should also remove fixer plans, tomahawk plans and all mods, since I know them.
---
The game is not about you, dude. Lots of people are starting new characters and I have two friends who have just started the game this week.
---
I'm right by Vault 76 and keep mine unlocked. Even with just 1 industrial, I have more than enough for myself.
---
Another settlement needs my help?
---
just followed the link, thank you I am excited!
---
Totally get it mate üëç
---
Amount of space (GBs) on the drive
---
A level 600 gave me a handmade fixer lol idk if its rare or wat but its a good gun
---
thanks, i really do like this game but it seems to not like me oh well.
---
I think anyone would burn out keeping that up on 3 characters.
---
Ultracite lasers and gattling lasers are separate weapons from lasers and gattling lasers. They use separate modes
---
Ultracite lasers and ult gat laser don't do bounse damage to scorched.
---
They touched the system recently, so it could be a new bug from this change:  **Scrapping:** Fixed an issue that caused crafting to use Junk items from the player‚Äôs Inventory and Stash before using their available Scrap. Crafting, building.
---
Took like a 2 day break so I didn't see them change it
---
Unfortunately, it would be immediately abused by people with trap bases. Which is why it isn't already in the game.
---
I love every little bit about that settlement! I really wish we could build something as cohesive as that in 76. It'll never happen, though. :(
---
Good point
---
Maybe try running a glass cannon like Bloodied. It still has that kind of feeling sometimes, albeit a bit different and not quite as... good? Fun? Satisfying? I‚Äôm not sure. But it‚Äôs kinda similar.
---
Though you'd be proud of the Enclaves accomplishments? You how, like what they did to get the defcon level high enough so that they can use the nukes in F76?
---
Yes please.  I've been stood at Morgantown train station for over a year and not a single train has turned up!
---
true. Reddit is definitely filled with whiners. I'll probably end up giving it anothrr shot
---
You can join me i love doing the event and have only failed a handful of times GT: Sk8npurplehippy. If you are the conduit you will become attacked but if you run far enough she normally locks to someone else my wife is always the conduit cause she has like 400 stimpaks supers and he hides on the building or inside the building while I stay outside with my vampire gauss rifle on my old character but with the new one all I have is a 2S ffr pistol so I‚Äôm not as strong lol.
---
Well, the replys uphere are really well explained. Actually, have learnt a lot about it. In case if you want to boost your experience real quick, you can hire [boosting services](https://mmoauctions.com/fallout-76/power-leveling). It work like this:  The professional player will play on your account and get levels faster by killing higher level enemies. Quite often they use some kind of monitor sharing programs, so you can see the progress as it goes (you can also learn something by watching what they do for the fastest gains). I hope it serves !
---
Almost like only 1 person working on the project plays the game and they aren't even developing the game...
---
The only time I ever die is to mirelurk kings and they drop anything special
---
You mean... The game is not about me and how I want to play it? I'm calling Todd...
---
Capture workshops and let them get taken over by the first wave of mobs so you have to do the ‚Äúretake‚Äù mission instead of the ‚Äúdefense‚Äù mission. Don‚Äôt worry about getting killed by players. Just store your junk after you capture a workshop. You‚Äôre not going to keep any of the places, you‚Äôre just trying to get the easy quest xp.
---
I got pretty lucky.  Probably burned up 50  SS roll opportunities and landed a couple of 3 star unyielding pieces as well as completing a semi decent overall SS 3 star set.  Modded all pieces with hardened capabilities and finally got the jet pack.   Overall, I‚Äôm pleased and this is coming from someone with a full Sent Assasins set.
---
Yeah thay should have a counter on how many times its been nuked to show what people think about the rewards for this event lol
---
You know who had an arc? Noah.
---
Agree to most of your points, except the nuke thing.
---
First, the codes are datamined. From the beta till today each week. I never encrypted a code myself, nor do I know anyone who did. Its a hell of hassle and may end up having the wrong code wasted hours of hours.
---
Also, nukes are ment to be endgame, locking it behind such an annoying mechanic for each server will result with no one launches them anymore, which clearly should not be the purpose.
---
Nooo, that would be horrble, unless you are in one of the 7 places that have a huge flat area, have you tried putting down the regular snappable fences?
---
I think the brotherhood of steel is pretty cool.  I also think the Cultists are interesting and we could get a good story out of them.  There is a lot of stuff they can do with this game and I imagine it will be getting updates for at least the next 2-3 years.
---
The BOS stuff could be bland or not bland it all depends on how they implement it.
---
And Just because you mentioned it, it's coming ;)
---
I stopped putting items in those clear display cases because I noticed my items would occasionally fall through the bottom and into the world. I guess it's based off which item loads first, maybe?
---
I noticed it by chance when I saw a teddy bear under one of my foundation pieces. It totally came from my case.
---
The display cases will lose items for me, however the Thanksgiving display case (tall one with 6 spaces) seems pretty safe. 
---
Just my observations.
---
But he has candy in his van!
---
Be really weird and tone death if they don't.
---
I fully expect them not to
---
It isn't garbled at all.  They are totalitarian zealots.
---
Yeah that was other things I was thinking of, make nights longer and darker (requires your flashlight). Make Rad Storms Dangerous, make mutations have a stronger draw back (while at it, changed the Mutant's perk to increase damage of weapon by X% per mutation, instead of 10% base damage.), make diseases much worst than they are. But while making every mob stronger, buff Power Armor, make it viable in this mode.  You should feel like walking fortress.
---
The SBQ dying in a few moments, was one of my main gripes and why i want this game mode. The "last boss" should be a threat, not some push over, but in turn, should give guaranteed 3\* and maybe more caps and more flux or something, in this game mode. Make it worth the ammo, chems, repairs, etc... that you need to go through, worth it.
---
Yes very much so.  The brotherhood operates on short term self serving goals.  The enclave plays 7D chess while you change around rodents with laser guns.  Besides your backwards thinking in New Vegas tword Veronica shows that you are actually just red necks with plasma guns and tin cans.
---
Resurgence of the OoM is all I‚Äôd ask for with this game. It wouldn‚Äôt even be difficult to do.
---
I just can‚Äôt understand why they‚Äôd create a whole new faction of assassin spies and then just have them dead and make us all try and join the brotherhood of steel.
---
I lost it from the thankgiving display cases actually, second row.
---
I use that too but... it's not the same lol
---
Ignore all the twats my friend. I haven't even put 200 hours into this game and it feels like a such a pain in the ass to play. Good luck though I hope you do come back to the game some point in the future.
---
In my dads car..... Vroom, Vroom.... Everybody dead
---
I kind of get where your coming from but what your basically saying is you don‚Äôt want fallout to be like a normal fallout game which quite frankly is a bit stupid
---
Pretty much every fo game has had bos and that is probably never going to change unless they go out of the us
---
&gt; And ammo is plentiful already.
---
As a former early player, it certainly was not lol. Higher levels had already got most places clean of their ammo and weapons. 
---
&gt;You can also equip the card to find more ammo
---
It hardly ever works at rank 3 lol.
---
You'd have a better chance at winning the lottery.
---
Oh yeah the mat.
---
Gonna sell those for 1c each tonight, (ps4)
---
If you are displaying junk, it could be pulled for crafting. Displayed items still count as being in the stash box.
---
They may have some unique dialogue but yeah there would be no difference between either faction
---
For the Holiday Scorched event?
---
It wouldn't surprise me, but at the same time, part of the appeal of that event was having so many Legendaries running around.  So, even if the gifts were unchanged, at least you'd still have that draw.
---
Thx alot for this
---
What‚Äôs interesting is in a day it did 4.2 i think. Everyone posting it‚Äôs not achievable. I‚Äôm not donating it‚Äôs a waste. Everyone pissed at the 150 million. Number. Next update it‚Äôs dropped to 15 million and somehow with all the negativity double the amount of the first day was donated. Seems like we won‚Äôt fail if nobody does a thing to me
---
Oh, lol you meant report the wendigo, I guess I can see that now that I re-read it haha.
---
As an avid NW player, this list really addresses most of the issues/suggestions/etc floating around in the community. 
---
I hate how a post coming from a new player/ bush wookie complaining about frog legs gets more attention than this list, because this is coming from folks who actually play it.
---
This, combined with the current PvP system where both parties have to fire at each other to start fighting, may actually be the best solution yet.
---
I mean, we‚Äôre gonna get more lore of the very early BoS. Stuff to expand upon it that even the original games didn‚Äôt have. I think it‚Äôll be just fine.
---
Sneak decreased
---
What do you mean? They have realeased a lot of information about a lot of their future plans recently, responded straight away for patch 21 and i would be expecting things to be reverted soon.
---
Thx, yes, the big map has huge potential for nice pictures.
---
Tanking the pylons is much simpler under stealth.  Throw on a CSS or combo a piece of chameleon armor with a stealth boy while you are taking the pylons.  Then just stay still behind a pylon and keep your super Stimpaks rolling.
---
If you partner up with someone that has any kind of decent build, they should be able to knock that thing down pretty easily.
---
Gotcha. Thanks!
---
I'm on Xbox as well.  I can tank the pylons for you if you need.
---
I wish they had just made it so the fixer was a craftable legendary, then we'd be sweet.
---
I run Bloodied on my main. The thing with Glass Cannon builds, in my opinion, are too strong. Bloodied by itself is not OP, but there are too many other things that make it god mode. Adrenal Reaction is where the damage comes from, then you add on stuff like Nerd Rage, and Serendipity (or Emergency Protocol in PA) which makes you almost unkillable. I only die from poison or killing myself with my own explosive weapons. 
---
On top of that, I got one piece of Life Saving SS armor, so I can self revive when i go down, and have Revenant perk, so increases my damage by 50% for 2 min. SBQ doesn't stand a chance.
---
I love that I can't tell if you're making this shit up cause it kinda sounds like something they'd do.
---
I don‚Äôt mind a bit of sprawl as long as the vendors are grouped. Joined a guy‚Äôs base yesterday that looked like I‚Äôd imagine a post-apocalyptic Appalachian set up would be. Shacks set up in a fortified circle. Was great stuff.
---
Explosive might work, as it doubles the fire rate.
---
Let's just face it: Rifle users were completely forgotten when they came up with the Bullion grind.
---
Some speculate that the BoS content is going to correct this in some way.  Whatever it is, I just hope it's not another charge-up Gauss weapon.
---
much obliged
---
hahaha get to it fellas :)
---
I really don't like being forced into supporting the BOS. Screw those luddite, poop-flap bucket heads.
---
Please and thank you! I‚Äôve been telling my group how much I adore this one. Wouldn‚Äôt mind having the ability to turn it off and on!
---
I agree that the rewards suck, but this is irrelevant to the situation. I am a FO1st member so I hoard any and all resources that I can find. I was surprised to see that I only had about 650 concrete. I donated 500 leaving myself with only 150. I think it is clear that the amount of available concrete that people have and what can be farmed is the real problem. I agree that people should work to achieve a goal with a reward. That said, the goal needs to be realistic. IMHO obtaining the amount of concrete and cork needed is so unrealistic, many are throwing up their hands in disgust and walking away.
---
Disagrees while proving my point in the same post. Okay then.
---
And you‚Äôre getting into a pissy tone and for what now?
---
You ever feel like remembering that reddit doesn‚Äôt show everything even after refreshing?
---
That‚Äôs before using 3 brain cells
---
Strange.
---
I'd love to see this.  They could instance off the secret basement (it's technically outside!) to allow for individual progression.  You could have:
---
- new recruit quests
---
- radiant daily quest (those Blood Eagles will, in fact, eventually kill themselves but it will take too long)
---
- an attack on the HQ
---
- a recruitable assaultron with a head laser that shoots cold.  German accent.  She trains your other recruits.
---
My fix On XBox:
---
1. I logged out.
---
2. I clicked "quit" from Home screen.
---
3. I re-entered
---
4. I was out of the hospital and the fuse was back on me but not the blood.
---
5. I got in the hospital.
---
6. I chose "Analyse" on the computer. It worked.
---
7. I replaced the fuse. 
---
etc.
---
Yes! I have a hard time getting rid of any holotapes. I‚Äôll pass up on most paper notes but if something feels significant lore wise I‚Äôll stash it too. I guess I‚Äôm role playing like some kind of archivist or historian piecing things together.
---
LOL ... they'll just be another faction to grind max rep with.
---
I think we‚Äôll see the colossus offer a good lvl of difficulty, but I doubt we‚Äôll see Bethesda go back to rework the SBQ. Bigger issue they have is magic weapons, which would fix the problem to an extent. And ultracite ammo in general is just such a niche machanic. It‚Äôs hard for anyone to be able to afford it for regular use and not a lot of players have the capacity to carry a secondary weapon that would only be used for the queen.
---
It‚Äôs just a boss that you either crush or can‚Äôt even touch.
---
why?
---
No no.. you maybe onto something here.
---
Well done Bethesda, I might log in today and actually try to donate some more concrete.
---
I've finished last week, on monday, and I'm enjoying the game a lot more. 
---
One thing is for sure, though, if the next season is just more of the same with the same idiotic linear growth attached to the SCORE ranks they can go and shove it, I'm not doing all of that ever again. 
---
I mean, the only rewards I use are the CC Dark Matter skin for my PA and I have a couple of sheepsquatch plushies sitting around my camp. That's it. Insane grind for basically fuck all. If it weren't for COVID I wouldn't have bothered with this at all.
---
Did you put some glitched ammo extractors at your camp? If so, they take up permanent budget even if you move camps and it looks like they are gone.
---
Oh, please don't get me wrong, I didn't mean moron as an insult. I would have just called you a moron outright. I meant it as a statement of fact. 
---
If you think paying for the ability to free up 400-500 in your stash isn't an advantage, when people constantly complain about limited stash and beg Bethesda over and over to increase the limit and you think that this is a smart take to have, I honestly don't know what you tell you.
---
Is that how you get out of the menu? I've been stuck in it twice and got my self out of it accidentally twice.
---
"We?" Are you a programmer deciding on the day's priorities?
---
There's no patch scheduled today.
---
Glad they mentioned the Covid pandemic in that information. People love to shit on Bethesda here for delays, but seem to forget about the virus that's killed 100,000's.
---
Finished it a week ago (Xp grinded) a lot just taking a break until a colossal problem comes out
---
But the whole thing about this game mode, is that you don't NEED to play it. If you are content with how things are done, stay in adventure mode. This would be completely optional. Not sure this was the exact way to go about it, specially with the way servers crash all the time. But it would be cool to make it slightly harder. Everything should be more difficult in this optional game mode, was the point I was trying to make.
---
With factions? Sure it would ... that's one way to get good PVP.
---
Would the introduction of time travel into the lore fix any plot holes?
---
Can you explain the personal 180 counter you mentioned? I've never heard it mentioned before.
---
I wouldn't hate a charge up Gauss weapon IF they would fix the damn VATS miss thing. I used an Instigating Gauss for a looooong time and the VATS thing just became too much to bear. But yeah, if I had my druthers I'd want something, anything that uses 5.56 ammo.
---
We as in the player base. I didn‚Äôt know they only fixed stuff for the programmers to play the game. Because it‚Äôs so evident they play the game.
---
Yes the BoS is a dynamic faction in fallout. With people making good and bad decisions. Morally gray decisions has always been one of the best parts of fallout for me. But the enclave has consistently been evil.
---
For instance the enclave caused the bos to go this far, against the scorch beast: "Rather than flee, the soldiers decided to continue manning their posts until the bitter end, trying to buy as much time for Appalachia as possible." 
---
The raiders has been a letdown for me, they were so bland I scrapped my evil character, and just did their mission on my main. If beth do a enclave update and they do them right I can have a proper evil character. Am quite excited for this.
---
Excellent ideas!
---
I would much rather have explored their original factions like the Free States, Responders, or the Mothman Cult than the BoS *yet again*.  I just don't think the BoS can bring much to the table that hasn't already been covered in past games.  There's little that I want to know more about them, even though this is an earlier incarnation of the BoS which will probably be twisted (it's all in the way Dorsey is so adamant about calling them "the good guys" - it's an immediate sign that they're going to be anything but).
---
OTOH, a lot of fans love the techno-fascists.  They also love the Enclave.  Which kind of makes me wonder if the broader moral of Fallout's story gets lost in translation somewhere...
---
*Scrip
---
Same for the whole game itself, you don't NEED to play it.
---
Why even bother to work on content not intended to be played by the vast majority? That's stupid and ignorant af.
---
That‚Äôs my plan for sure. 100 percent this thing and peace out for a while. I‚Äôm not slowing down, but the SCORE needed to rank up after level 80 is definitely slowing me down.
---
I think the explosive modifier and 50 limb dmg are mutually exclusive though? Not positive
---
That'd be pretty solid. But man .45 ammo is such a grind compared to 5.56.
---
I got mine from Harper's ferry robot
---
Honestly: No. My camp is near West-Tek so there are not many new players in the area. I don't need the water I produce by any means but I like the idea of my camp constantly producing ressources for me to sell and with purified water i can max out the vendor caps easily. If anyone is *that* thirsty they can get boiled water from my waterwell and cooking station and use my radiation shower afterwards if need be.
---
I‚Äôve already slowed way down at rank 57 currently. I probably won‚Äôt finish the board and I don‚Äôt care I‚Äôve already got the rewards I wanted. Already got the faction rewards I want besides the gauss shotgun but it doesn‚Äôt take more than 20 minutes to find his stolen equipment and take some pictures so I‚Äôm okay with logging on once a day, doing that and a queen fight and I‚Äôm good for the day. Really not much else to do in the game when you only have one maxed out end game character. I tried making a second character but couldn‚Äôt help but feel like I was just doing all the same stuff again. My main toon can switch between 3 different builds quickly and easily with no point swapping so I pretty much have everything I need in one character.
---
Lol this is like the 20th post this week and they all sound the same as this. Y'all don't need us to know about you leaving.
---
Well if we are basing anything off this game on thoughts on factions they all suck.  I'm less anti bos/settler/raider/mothman as I am get of my perfect west Virginia lawn you raggedy ass squatters.
---
Ok. I‚Äôve been playing the game for a long time and I don‚Äôt recall ever seeing the sentinels in the name. Exceedingly rare and it being the 3rd modifier might be why
---
Yeah, Someone Built me a camp a couple weeks ago and im now just changing it.
---
Again, this is not a rework of adventure mode. This is just a totally new and 100% optional game mode were everything is stronger.
---
&gt; pissy
---
&gt; before using 3 brain cells.
---
Ironic coming from you.
---
*laughs in Market Gardener*
---
I disagree with most of your points, but I'm upvoting for "Weasel Words".
---
LOL
---
Do people use non legendary weapons? I guess maybe the Fat Man. I can't see a use for them other than scrapping for mods.
---
Couldn‚Äôt it be that the weekend stats didn‚Äôt get updated until yesterday or today?
---
They really missed the boat on some PVP content with the arena.
---
Steel, plastic, cloth, wood, glass. Easy. Leather also not bad to get either. Concrete... a pain. CORK? What?
---
I don't think it stacks, but each piece has it's own chance...more armour gives more chances.
---
Don't worry it will get knocked down to at least 20 million
---
Try the Welcome Mats. I tried the grey one and it kept clipping. Switched to the welcome mats and it works.
---
Welp, there ya go.
---
PvP without VATS is how it should be IMO. Leave the aimbotting to PvE and the script kiddies.
---
There's other effects that make weapons *magic*, not just Limb. ;)
---
Oh cool, I'm actually at Top of the World right now!  I have Sunnytop station as a fast travel point but nothing in between! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Thanks for the help! I know I could have looked it up but I still feel like Bethesda should have activated a quest or given some in-game help for people who are a bit lower level.
---
Yeah I need a way to offload plasma cores. I'm still dropping them and it still feels bad.
---
He is and there is a lot of other stuff going on.
---
If you clear Fort Defiance you can get probably 10 or so straight jackets. They are 50c each. Whitesprings has good outfits, they sell for a bunch as well.
---
They've buggered around with the building mechanism recently in that last patch.
---
Is your doorway at the foot of the stairs like:
---
|_/
---
Or
---
|/
---
Try moving it back and change your position when placing it.
---
Try removing any floor or roof tile directly above its placement beforehand.
---
Good luck.
---
Because Bethesda has the staff of a former mobile game development studio running Fo76.
---
Well Rested - take quick nap then all of the above
---
This.  I play solely on my private world with friends.  Never PVP.  My stash contains pretty much exactly what CoffeeZerg suggested hoarders keep.
---
It's not P2W in my case, just a huge convenience.
---
This happened to me and I'm not using the new CAMP skin..
---
You claim them via the atom shop, and they're there for a limited time. You have until the 19th to claim the beret.
---
line in the sand has always awarded me 1 per SB killed.
---
tech data turn in occasionally awards one.  
---
There are several static spawns for cores - find them just sitting on a table.  There are 3 static spawn points within a couple minutes walk of posiedon.
---
I occasionally get cores as loot from high level ghouls.  Got 3-4 of them at Radiation Rumble.   Get at least 1 about every 3rd pass through WS.
---
Have gotten as many as 5 at Camden.  The event given by the manager can award 1.  Plus 2 generators, one PA spawn, and one in an ammo can.
---
The sentrybot at blair trainyard.
---
if you don't mind partial cores, then any PA spawn or fusion generator.
---
Only one has been released so far, and yes they are limited time, but I think you have another week for the beret.
---
I could see people redoubling their efforts based on the low 4M number... course, I could also see them giving up outright.
---
Glad to help!
---
Yeah a quest marker in game would have been a good idea. At the very least they should have made it a free fast travel marker for the duration of the event I think.
---
I leave everything unlocked, water, acid, ammo, collectron. My house is your house. Welcome Friends!
---
Anything is possible. Though is it plausible...? 
---
Seems odd that we've had a steady increasing count to 4m until Bethesda shifted the goal posts and soon after we have the massive jump.
---
As I alluded to, we'll never know one way or the other.
---
I have a restaurant/bar near Sutton and two small purifiers outside that ae never locked.  Not too much traffic either, but it's there along with a small cot in the back by the rad shower.
---
I'm not sure how this is ignorant... to answer your condescending statement: Because they added it in Fallout 4? Obviously there's a demand for harder content. Hand holding mode would still be there for you, don't worry.
---
Ah good to know. I see I have more research to do
---
I said that should have been the drops the first time around and got downvoted to hell.
---
Hey BoS, you know how to make an uhhhhhhhh Chemistry Workbench? I got mountains of plans to tell you how
---
Indeed, I don't see how Cork doesn't get adjusted.  The fact is, Concrete was off by literally an order of magnitude, from 150 million clear down to 15 million.  Someone either didn't care, or they made a gross overestimation based on how much Concrete was actually in the world and what players would do to gather it.
---
We landed on the moon!?  Jk but yeah, bloody mess should be unlocked as early as possible and used with all builds.  In similar vein to Glow Sight, you might look into the exterminator cards under perception to use during Heart of the Swamp and similar.
---
I have all the plans but I'm not using any of those weapons.
---
I want a souped up Gatling Gun, the sound of that thing is just so incredibly satisfying. :)
---
Or a souped up Shovel, to mix things up.
---
BOOM BOOM BOOM
---
BOING BOING BOING
---
:D
---
There are some solo guides out there.
---
Basic idea; Troubleshooters armor, and a fast fire rate vamp weapon pretty much makes you invulnerable to all of the bots. Dense torso, or Fireproof perk for the exploding eyebots. Marsupial will keep you far enough from the squatch to avoid the 1-shots. Strafe to avoid the eye laser.
---
Most times I don't even bother switching from diluted stims, to supers.
---
The survival tent is super juicy for junk farming runs. Scrap to scrapbox, the other 1400 lbs of guns you can drop on the ground then TP back n forst between your preferred vendor and the tent. All without having to move your camp.
---
Someone posted a little bit ago to move you camp a few time to make it go away
---
Based on their ooh-rah boy scout actions, they $should$ take over the silos.  It fits their M.O. perfectly.  I did their quests and rode in their birds.  Then i killed every last one of them.
---
Ad victorium, MoFo.   BOS is a weak storyline, like boy scouts with armor.     I dropped off concrete and received two snickers bars and a coke.....  150 caps in fast jumps for that?   
---
I would prefer it if BOS assaulted West Virginia....
---
Me, mutants, grahm, athena, foundation and crater against arrogant, flatulent BOS and my three nuke silos
---
Pretty sure cursed weapons are set effects like the fancy pump.  More of a collectors item than anything else.
---
We know one thing for certain - they didn't bother play testing it or base it off any collection rate stats.
---
I support the enclave 100%. I love them!
---
What happens if you muck it up?
---
They are looking at the scope of the issue so they can address it and get it fixed as soon as they can. Since this is a blocker it's a high priority. They don't have a fix just yet but are working on one. We'll keep you updated as they progress!
---
You mean go to terminal spend 30 minutes navigating a menu to send a companion on an "expedirion" that will return in 6 hours with a 30% chance at a 1 star legendary
---
really want to give your shotgun some love? Slap a long Barrel  on it, and max out Skeetshooter in perception. 
---
You can thank me later.
---
I'm having a lot of fun trying out different weapons. A *magic* Gauss Shotgun is absolutely ridiculous in VATs! Junkies ffr LMG too, oooft!
---
Do you have the new camp skin on? The future tech one from the legendary run
---
But it‚Äôs a game mode that you suggested would use the same account as our adventure mode after lvl 300. So the changes that would be made in a theoretical new survival mode would have affects on players in the other as well, especially if we‚Äôre also using dev time to rework existing mechanics instead of content built for a more general audience.
---
Do you use the CAMP skin from the legendary run? If so, remove it, it's broken.
---
Get this man an upvote!
---
bloody mess is a well known must have card for any build..
---
glow sight being only useful for glowing enemies(obviously) is a card I wouldnt use other than to swap in for a nuke zone since youre spending points on something that isnt giving back 100% of the time..
---
I put glow sight in the same category as the cards that only work for you in the daytime or at night..
---
For some reason my CAMP gets hit by one about once a week. It's due South of the Lucky Hope Mine and east of Relay Tower EL-B1-02.  It always goes down quickly and never has any good loot on it.
---
I‚Äôd appreciate any help I can get haha. I‚Äôll add you and bourbonier when I get home
---
It feels like they played Fallout 4, saw all the cinder blocks scattered about W. Virginia but didn't realize in 76 those are static objects. 
---
Although surprised garden gnomes aren't being farmed. Hornwright Test Site #2, garden on the south side of Huntersville, shed at General's Steakhouse.
---
In reference of Harambe
---
I would love to see a return of the responders to counter the BoS, then have a secret group in the responders running the OoM on the side.
---
I want a bloodied shovel JUST for Buried with Honor.
---
I need to find a ‚Äúmagical‚Äù list out there
---
I honestly have no idea, I've only ever launched one nuke because it generally seems more trouble than it's worth.
---
Fallout 4 was not an online multiplayer game.
---
Your hand holding mode is still too hard for some excavator noobs, which are obvious Bethesdas targeted audience. Its a casual game you freak, they don't spend money on a game mode for 5% of their player base when 80% duckling around without a proper build just to have all weightreduction perks active.
---
I already said I would like the idea, nothing much to do with lvl 1020 and several alt chars. But it ain't gonna happen just because a small minority you think you are leading wants action, go wait for the modsupport (lol).
---
There is a rumor that alongside the BoS, they could be adding a new cryptid to the game.
---
So long as the scrap is available, it won't dismantle any junk
---
Blueprints don't take up budget, but stored items do!
---
Really? I find a lot of .45 in ammo boxes etc. and usually in pretty good quantities. 
---
Using that perk that increases chances of finding extra ammo in boxes actually turned into a good choice for me, I found quite a lot of ammo early on that helped out later in the game.
---
I have one. Not a bloodied build so it's pretty much just a shovel but there isn't enough BOING in this game.
---
Same with Ultracite Armor plans.
---
So I think I'm there with you guys in average. I did 1750 steel and no concrete.
---
I don‚Äôt know if you heard or not but yesterday they lowered the requirement from 150m to 15m and by last night we donated 12.5m concrete. We might actually make it!
---
As a long-term Fallout fan (ever since the first PC demo in the 90s), IMO the BOS is the most iconic thing about the franchise. A secret militaristic tech monastery buried in the desert doing their best to put the world back together while everyone on the surface scrapes by for bottle caps and radroach meat? Long before we ever met the Institute, the Enclave, or a surging NCR, they were basically humanity's only hope for a path out of barbarism. And there was something so interesting about an organization that embraced/collected tech, but also couldn't help but devolve socially into something straight out of the middle ages. A lot can be said for how Bethesda decided to treat the group in their Fallouts, but for me the group never quite lost that allure.
---
Good PvP in 76? You‚Äôre joking, right? As much as I want that, all it would end up doing is making every other post here about how PvP doesn‚Äôt belong and then Bethesda would just take it away. Again.
---
Man i spent so much time explaining to folks around here the season pass isn't a good direction knowing Bethesda. Time sensitive grind fest with pay-to-advance option.
---
Some rewards are cool, but we really didn't need 8 guille suits... half of which have major clipping issues.
---
True!
---
I thought this too lol. They better give us A LOT of cool BoS camp stuff for this later on. Knowing Bethesda, it will not come for free, but I'd be happy if it was from Atom Shop. Been role playing as a BoS soldier since game launch.
---
I've never tried that perk. And to be fair, I was using an auto Fixer of the non-bloodied variety. It just used way more ammo than a comparable handmade and I was having to do far more frequent Lucky Hole runs.
---
You have to battle your way out and kill all in the building.  They come in two or three waves.  I ended up dying a couple of times as too many at once and shooting from all over the place not just one direction.
---
I like the BOS...**IN OTHER FALLOUT GAMES**. It's really annoying how Bethesda just keeps shoehorning them in to all the games, plausibility be damned. And they can't even write them very well. In FO3, they tried to make them "the good faction" and then made them the blimp fascists in FO4. At least New Vegas acknowledged that they were in decline because of their isolationism.
---
Haha I'm the same.  The dopamine hit when see a player vendor with over 1k junk.
---
The ice Floaters are annoying sometimes. One time I fast traveled to a teammates camp, I walked away from the game for a minute or so, and I came back to see that there was an ice Floater attacking me. He didn't kill me but I lost a couple of fusion cores since I was in power armor.
---
[https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs](https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs)
---
This was one of my later solo runs (using a Vampires Gauss Minigun). I prefer to take the event on alone, so other folks don't screw it up.
---
On Xbox here - if you ever want to join &amp; stay out of the way.
---
Can you imagine that?  That would be incredible!!!
---
Maybe 2022....
---
Hey, I can dream.
---
But yeah, that's probably why it is the way it is. Don't want to force people into PVP by making them actually choose a faction. I mean an online multiplayer game with PVP? Sheesh, why?
---
Member.
---
You can already see the number of plans but how about seeing the number of known plans? That would solve this problem.
---
They should absolutely do more with the OoM. I still can‚Äôt believe that amazing secret base is just sitting there empty, with nothing to do in it after the quest.
---
The only objection that I have to fast travel mats is how easy that would make trap camps.
---
I used to think that the WoW devs were the worst of the worst in this regard.
---
But then i started playing Fo76 and learned my lesson.
---
The base damage is 1 according to the wiki but that might be wrong to what I used: I had 44 strength at the time using unyielding (not full set) radicool, max base strength and a deathclaw wellington (6 str with carnivore) another +6 from whiskey with the perk and then I had other melee buffs with carnivore stacked because I run that with unarmed usually meaning glowing meat steak +20% mutton chops +20% Yao Guai ribs +20%, mutant hound chops +20% and i am not sure if I had that on but yao guai roast +30% and mutton meat pie +30% and also had bloody mess 15%
---
Seems like a waste of legendary armor especially since it doesn‚Äôt seem to work better than just having one piece. It says 50/50 chance but it seems to work more often than not just having one piece. Maybe I just have good luck ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Add me and find me sometime, I can help get you setup: orias
---
Thanks for the response.  
---
Based on a little research last night, I decided to restart my character.  In my first run, I'd been using bobby pins, caps, and ammo without any concern because they were all so prevalent in FO4.  I also had spent a few too many points trying to get my Strength up so that I wouldn't be encumbered all the time.  
---
After restarting, I've been careful to watch my ammo, I've only found one bobby pin so that's not an issue, and I've been more selective in my SPECIAL points. 
---
It also has helped that I've begun selling a bunch of junk rather than trying to horde everything. Not only does that help with storage, it also increases my caps for when I do need to go buy supplies.
---
Hey try Tasty squirrel stew it‚Äôs base in 10% exp
---
But with carnivore it‚Äôs 20%
---
And with strange in numbers it‚Äôs 25%
---
Yeah same here.  I pretty much just complete my SCORE challenges for the day and try to farm Mire events.  It‚Äôs not fun when most of the time spent is waiting and server hopping for these events but it is what it is.
---
There's the guess pistol, not per but not STR either
---
With how laggy encyptid has always been; and even more so post-update 21, it's just as likely you die after getting downed from a stray laser, assaultron blast, or the exploding eyebots which I swear have the explosion radius of a perk-bonused mininuke; none of it even registering graphically because the server and engine are too busy downing moonshine until the pain goes away
---
Whats a synth? Never heard of them before.
---
Thanks for reply!
---
Sounds like one of those old hillbillys (I think it's the region in USA where they are from?) in the movies sitting on his porch with a shotgun. Can just imagine him pointing his double barrel at a fusion powered robot suite wearing, gatling laser carrying soldier, deadass telling him "get off my  lawn"
---
I have a duplicate custom.ini with the archive section commented out, and the batch files rename them to swap them depending on which I use. I've also got the icon version of Ratmonkey's sorting mod installed, so they swap out the modified base game archives for vanilla backups or vice versa and rename the Interface folder to disable/enable it.
---
I‚Äôm at like 68, or so. Already burnt out and disinterested. Wanted the Gatling gun skin, just can‚Äôt bring myself to care to log in every day anymore
---
Broadcast?
---
Due to... Reasons... I never have the game sound on.
---
It's kinda funny when people are using voice and I just emote ????
---
You can side with the wayward?
---
How do you start that questline? Just got the game a few weeks ago and it sounds interesting.
---
If you wanna mow em down, get a decent gamma gun. Quad does nicely.
---
Consider a vampire weapon with a high rate of fire. I run the event with a vampire gauss minigun. Allows me to take pylons and stand toe to toe with the fake squatch. As long as I am dealing damage I‚Äôm not taking any. Vampires was a turning point for me, as I was always failing this event prior.
---
Its exactly the region.  Some would say WV is the epicenter of these "fine" folks.
---
Oh I'm sorry, I fucked up when trying to apply the mods resulting in the lower numbers and it's more than obvious now that I got back into the game to see what my dr was at
---
Ooh I see evil people who exploit this system to load up bad pics onto everyone's loading screen...
---
Plenty dont, especially the more RPG-ish ones; or when they do, it's in specifically instances separate areas just for pvp.
---
Like Secret World, for example
---
Reiterating, sell ammo. 45 and fusion cells are my biggest sellers
---
That thing is permanently feed on your budget, there is no way to remove it.
---
But there isn't any of political America left that they wanted to be Free of in the first place, even if they had survived, in which case what have they been doing all this time? Too many inconsistencies to work imo but hey.. Anything Goes, right?
---
I recently have been using an auto combat rifle (no fixer) as my backup as I run a melee build. 
---
I've been lucky enough to find batches of .45 ammo between 20-50 rounds at a time when they turn up. The perk really made a difference in extra ammo turning up - great now that I can turn it in on the convertor despite it being a pain.
---
I use the reward 10mm that does the flame damage (from the quest up at the water park) for lower level enemies and use the combat rifle for bigger ones when I need to fight at range or can't reach them to hit them. 
---
For SBQ fights I tend to use a gatling gun...tried a nice minigun but it chewed through so much ammo so fast it was just impossible.
---
My latest discovery has been a quad explosive railway rifle. I had it for a while but didn't realize what a brute it was on full auto against tough enemies. Target in vats and pull the trigger...I swear it practically cut a scorchbeast in half in one clip. Easily the best up close ranged weapon I've ever used. Just don't use it on small stuff as the recoil will pull you all over the place.
---
I guess some prototype weapons or maybe a hyrbrid T-51/60 power armor?
---
I saw a picture of something like that on the Fractured Steel update icon.
---
I‚Äôm a FISTO man, myself.
---
True, I‚Äôd spend a few caps if someone sold Nuka cola out of vending machines
---
Same for me. Ill take a few weeks break until they release season2.
---
God bless you, fellow American.
---
I won‚Äôt be on till later today but when I get the add I‚Äôll add you back and you just let me know when you want to do it.
---
Well, I figured that since Bethesda would be running the show from the comp to the upload, that kind of stuff wouldn't be an issue.
---
You have to find one of the bodies of the Mistresses. They are in various locations, but there's one in an alleyway near the entrance of AVR Medical Center... Loot the body and the quest will begin.
---
LOL!
---
I'd like to see DC, it should look like the inside of a very green nuke this early.
---
I know many are upset with all the "mounted" plans, which is why I have 0 of them for sale at my c.a.m.p. There are wayyy too many of them floating through circulation.
---
Hmm I'm a new player been playing a little over 3 weeks. I have over 1k ammo of every type except some of the rarer ones. Between mobs, containers, crafting, and most being 1cap on player vendors im overflowing in ammo and i don't have any cards for it. I dont use all the guns though so that could be why.
---
Just have a look at the post I linked, explains everything. But feel free to ask me if you want to know anything! Always happy to help a fellow Wastelander!
---
You can, but they need to be thought through. The ‚ÄòMayor for a Day‚Äô quest is a pretty good example of lasting consequences that don‚Äôt upset the game as a whole. I just wish there was a lot more of that sort of thing in FO76.
---
If you mean you don‚Äôt trust this team to deliver it, though, well...we could certainly talk about *that.*
---
&gt; mobs
---
The Scorched need to be nerfed TBH. They hardly get affected by shotguns and seem to have pinpoint accuracy.
---
Also pretty sure vendor in crater has some. But my memory could be spotty.
---
I like that it almost looks like something you could come across, that would be generated in the game. Being in the Ash Heap, you should go for more of a junk / destroyed camp, vs the more clean build that you have going on.
---
Not exactly my cup of tea, as I've been role playing BoS soldier since launch, so my builds and ones I like most, are always Steel and Concrete. 
---
All in all, good job though, I like it.
---
I'm already taking a break from the game. It's all too much for a casual try  hard like me. Especially after I got screwed on an extra month's charge of 1st. But I digress, I'm taking a break from multiplayer stuff for a bit. It's relaxing.
---
WITNESS!
---
Bruh of all the totalitarian zealots why couldn't we just have the Fleet of Particular Justice roll in and glass the Cranberry Bog or smth? Now that'd be wild
---
Correct. The "list" is attached to your character. The game remembers how many things youve looted, and where you looted them. To get item number one to respawn in location A, you need to loot enough items to get item number one to fall off the list so that it can respawn.
---
Bear in mind that certain items only have chances to spawn. Like say fusion cores. Other items, like say the static spawn .50cal machine gun in the truck bed at Abandoned Bog Town, will always respawn in that exact spot when you reset them off the list. And the contents of containers are randomized upon respawn.
---
Yeah ik
---
That‚Äôs a bit of a cop out by Bethesda, could you imagine if the Brotherhood coming gets delayed because we didn‚Äôt get the quota lol
---
I got to rank 100, and i am just done.
---
I don't really care about this BoS event, i want good stuff for this game.  
---
Instead we have stupid "bring me this, bring me that"  
---
Yeah, i will wait for a month or so
---
Same! One of the best ever Fallout DLCs
---
I use tesla rifle to avoid oneshot things. Allright, then I dont care, I will use my explosive gatling plasma and steal your XP. You asked for it.
---
Yeah I may have had my hopes up too much.
---
this.
---
If you want a little bit of fun, get a few hits on the (passive) SB when it flies over.   
---
It will agro, but will not attack.  hit it a few more times.
---
usually, this will cause one of the scorched to change from the usual L1-6 to a L68.
---
Makes life interesting if you are using a low damage/low level weapon.
---
Morgantown might be worth a shot?
---
Best place is in a private server. Anywhere you nuke will get farmed by the whole server
---
I guess you could try harpers ferry though
---
I don't find I see THAT many people at Whitesprings anymore during a nuke.
---
Whitespring is best, Morgantown is also good. Unfortunately, if you cant get on a private server, there is nowhere to nuke that is safe from other players.
---
Sure, just woke up. Give me a few.
---
Wow that's something that really had me confused. Thanks.
---
Maybe we‚Äôll go to somewhere away from the actual map of Fallout 3, one of the Out of Bounds areas.
---
There aren't any areas with high enemy counts that you will be able to farm without other people showing up. Most people need those materials, why would we not try to get some if you launch on a public server?
---
You could do Morgantown as well, lots of ghouls and scorched in that area between the trainyard, the airport and Morgantown itself.

The Brotherhood will always be around because of their power. They have the ability and resources of a real military(except for abundance of STEEL and cork of course) so they‚Äôre really not going anywhere. What‚Äôs important, like some other commenters stated, is how they are implemented in the game. It could be the most boring quest line or it could be very adventurous where we get to hunt cryptids to a further extent, maybe they‚Äôre coming to Appalachia to research the flatwoods monster in hope they gain some juicy tech knowledge that the brotherhood drools over. They could be coming because they‚Äôre pissed at the enclave for having control of the silos. It could be anything but we only know they‚Äôre coming to see what happened to taggerdy and such. As a Paladin myself, I‚Äôm only hoping bethesda makes it interesting enough so people don‚Äôt further hate on the brotherhood lol
---
Ever since they dropped what materials are needed I have been scavenging those materials. Not hard core just bits and pieces. So far I have gotten 17 bulk cork and 25 bulk concrete. That bit me in the arse when I donated all my concrete forgetting I was going to change some of my camp walls thus having to buy 2 bulk concrete. There simply isn't enough cork and concrete materials. Factor in time it takes to respawn, amounts in the universe and amount of players it just doesnt math.

&gt; and lazy.

Welcome to Bethesda
---
Nuke the pumpkin house and hit the fissure nearby.  Harvest an ultracite node, kill the scorched that spawn and just do that over and over.  Get a lot of all 3 every time I've done it.  Not nearly as many people show up when someplace weird like that gets hit.  Some still will but it should be less busy than whitespring.
---
Little does he know, he‚Äòll soon be banned for d00ping by beth, due to the crapload of ressources he has! Ha!
---
I keep my Pristine Nuka Cola machine stocked with all kinds of non-Shine Nuka Colas. On the house. No one takes any.
---
Loved the OoM quests. And agree BoS is not just boring, but borderline yikes since all that crusader stuff has been taken up by some of the more unsavory groups out there IRL.
---
I hope not. Imagine trying to get perfect 5 star rolls. 3 stars is enough of a grind.
---
A group of us did that. We filmed ourselves rolling down the road on invisible horses
---
Yeah I can imagine lol just know the nuking etiquette. Also, was kinda a waste of your nuke as well. Could have waited till they finished, then nuked the site again and killed the Queen again to farm a little.
---
Bethesda shuts down the public servers and makes everyone buy FO1st
---
It shouldn't take it for crafting. Personally the only time its done it to me is if I stay in a world my camp couldn't be placed. The stuff will display next time you camp is there as it remebers what was on display but in the meantime it doesn't remember not to craft with it.
---
Does this happen on more than one character?
---
The problem is that the picture has to be delivered from the servers. Hackers on pc at least are able for a long time to read certain infos from the server like characters reference id or being able to send damage - this is used alot for nuclear winter.
---
It wouldn't surprise me if they managed to hook into this system aswell and upload shitty memes, NSFW or worse. That could cause some serious problems for Bethesda meaning they get sued.
---
They already spawned the prydwen, generated glitched weapons, armor and outfits with legendary effects and looking at a single hack tools capability... it will be possible I bet.
---
Yo, I am so hyped for the future of Bethesda Games. I hope the double sided wall tech is developed by the time Elder Scrolls 6 comes out.  
---
Bethesda Game Studios - "Pushing the bounds of Technology"
---
Explains why going back to fort defiance isn‚Äôt spawning asylum unis. I got lucky and got a pink one and two blue ones, went back a dozen other times and nothing was there.
---
Also has to do with other people looting that place constantly too but after 30 servers I found it hard to believe not one location had a asylum uni laying around
---
Nah, they checked OP's post history and noticed they're taking shit.
---
do you have a ton of those bugged ammo converters at your camp?
---
Thanks guys! I get back on the 16th so this works out well
---
Is that the car that goes around killing Settlers ?
---
I have not found much crimson there.  Cobalt, yes, crimson, no.
---
The BOS have been in everything Fallout game since FO1.
---
Brotherhood is boring, yeah. Beth needs to get over them.
---
I did my last robot challenge recently and got my full 80.
---
I know this isn't what you want to hear but if its worth it to you and you have proof videos or screenshots all you can do is contact support.
---
Just to make you spend more of your life ingame.
---
Exactly this... when I saw the first set of numbers I giggled at how bad and off balance they were... 
---
Who has magnitudes more cork in their stash than steel??? Answer: no one.
---
I'd be down for an Anti-Material Rifle
---
Didn't they said at quakecon that they are not up expanding it?
---
Its not necessarily needed aswell, also it would mess up the messed up balance even more.
---
If you're worried that it's no longer a gritty apocalypse, that ship sailed a long time ago with the Atomic Shop cosmetics. Fallout 76 has pretty much been a Fallout theme park since its release. Which I get is annoying if you were wanting a mainline lore-friendly Fallout game, but let's not pretend that it was otherwise.
---
I like grafton steel yard.  If u nuke whole area catching the steel yard, workshop and dam u should be able to get decent amount.  
---
Workshop will spawn events for more NPC to farm.
---
It's all we ask for. Realistic expectations.
---
Pretty sure for atom challenges you have to use photo mode not the camera for it to count
---
Google search maps for it- South West (bottom left) corner looks like the next best spot for crimson.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt really focus on builds I just try to focus on what perks are gonna help me survive the best
---
&gt;I wouldn't hate a charge up Gauss weapon IF they would fix the damn VATS miss thing
---
Don't forget the failure to fire where you charge the thing up and it just fizzles out once you let go of the trigger.
---
i don't know the abbreviation parlance and don't have time to look it up right now.  buuuuut.  in a few days i'll be doing a scrip dump and will be rolling armor.  so if you don't get it elsewhere i'll keep my eyes open on that dump.
---
It's all about negotiation and getting to Yes.
---
The original numbers were off so bad... they need to go ahead adjust the others to, like I don‚Äôt cork?!? Lol
---
It's definitely a double edged sword. I love having something to work towards. But I'll be happy to just log on and fuck around without worrying about leveling up daily. Although that grind has loaded me up with scrip weapons for weeks.  And I'm level 91 and should be done by the weekend at least.
---
Are you using the camera or photo mode?
---
I did this challenge back in the day before the camera was added and I'm pretty sure you have to use photo mode at specific locations and not the camera for that challenge
---
Edit: Also yes discover challenges are just plain broken. Take screenshots of the locations being discovered and the incomplete atom challenge and open a support ticket sometimes they will just credit the atoms.
---
With how long it takes for shit to respawn, other players we never get a chance to see them
---
Thx man, appreciate it
---
Anyplace with a high concentration of Aster Flowers and/or brain fungus.  I know both of those turn to crimson flux.  
---
The ghouls will respawn a few times before the nuke zone wears off, so you'll get multiple chances to get HRF/HM/GM.  
---
IMHO, HRF is by far the hardest to get in quantity.  Will probably take a couple different nuke zones to collect a decent amount.
---
Don't forget chemist &amp; superduper when you are stabilizing :)
---
Nice to know, glade I already did all challenges pre wastelanders.
---
Like buddy said, you may here like a couple different voicelines depending on your rep with the other factions and who you chose to raid with and maybe not even that. They really screwed the pooch on any good storytelling and dynamic growth with anything in this game. People argue its just not possible with this game but i just think bethesda didnt take advantage of instanced areas soon enough. Then they half assed crater and foundation, i gues the insides played their part but i never go in them since i finished the story. So all that being said i imagine the new BoS missioms will.comsis of: go find the tags and holotape from this dead patrol, so support this team thats pinned down( if we're lucky), or go find this thing we need. Max rep gets  you a new set of power armor, a skin for all the guns we already own, and maybe some defences with the BoS logo. I bet none of the gaurds will even defend the base with the big guns they lug around
---
Is your NAT open on Xbox?
---
Grahm sells them.
---
I have a set on XB
---
So I always set my character up to carry the most every since beta. And when I quit playing after beating main story for about 6 months. When I came back to the game I started messing around with perk cards. I already was set up to be bloodied being I used the one that gives 5 extra strength for more rads. Then I got a 3 star bloodied grognak axe and used that. Loved it then got a bloodied death claw and used that a bunch too. It wasn‚Äôt until I got a 2 star bloodied combat where I really wanted to invest into other perks. I‚Äôm level 290 and just recently switched over all my perks to do bloodied stealth commando and I love seeing me hit 2k headshots. It‚Äôs amazing.
---
You no doubt have a point about the lack of concrete and perhaps the spawn rate on it should be increased, but even if that was done it's very unlikely the goal would be met due to the fact people don't see a reason to do it in the first place.
---
We never find Abby or Raleigh Clay's corpses, meaning they **could** be alive
---
Actually. What happened to you that makes you think you have a right to control how people play a game?
---
While I always lower the price from what comes up. I never price all ammo at one cap.
---
Seriously tired of seeing posts like this. It‚Äôs their vending. Their right.
---
Yeah, they aren't proud of their gene material getting stuck behind screen for hours.
---
Hit a random vending machine for yesterday's daily to buy a little bit of ammo. "Oh sweet, .50 cal!  I'm running kind of low"
---
Shit you not they had it at 5 caps a round.  I bought 3 single 10mm rounds for one cap each and left.
---
Did you remember to turn pacifist mode off?
---
I've only done the hunter thing a few times and I'm fairly certain if you have pacifist on it doesn't auto turn off for this.
---
I'll check it in just a moment and let you know.
---
Complaining about such things let me think you are a huge disappointment to your parents. 
---
Who cares?
---
Too expensive? Move on ffs... people have problems these days...
---
True, but the enemy spawn rates are pretty good for farming the other mats.
---
Does it respawn on that server or do you still have to server hop?
---
Get herbivore mutation.  Get grouped up, use strange in numbers perk.  
---
Well rested, cran relish, brain fungus soup, and Unyield armor.  Kill away.  
---
U also have lunch boxes u can use.
---
But there are cabins in the actual ash heap itself, mine blends! 
---
If that was the case I'd only build with wood in the mire or concrete, wood around 76 and metal in cranberry bog as watoga is robots. I think the ash heap would be wood or brick in honesty. I went with an open camp look also, its not built up much at all. 1 house, 1 cabin with sleeping bags, campfire etc. A Caravan looking set up next to the cabin...
---
I agree with what your saying 100%, but don't agree with not supporting BoS. They are personally, my fav faction lol. 
---
You certainly should not feel like you have to support a faction you dislike. If you chose to not support the BoS, you should be opted out of their rewards, but in return, get to claim rewards that the BoS supporters did not get. Instead of giving everything, to everyone, regardless of if you choose to side with this faction, or not.
---
For role players, I can understand that this is rather annoying. I'm just lucky that I've been role playing as a Brotherhood Soldier since launch, so seeing this event, made me quite happy.
---
I noticed more vendors selling ammo higher (as well as selling Missles and Mini Nukes more) since the Ammo Converter came into play. Maybe they figured people would buy them for the Ammo Points?
---
ghoul slayer weapon + glowsight3 is also great fun at RR.
---
It would be nice if they added the rest of the rare plans that have never been in these:
---
T-60 Base Plans  
---
Ultracite Mod Plans  
---
Ash Heap, Mire and Bog Healing Salve plans  
---
Ash Heap Disease Cure  
---
All the underarmor linings, including shielded Raider and Casual  
---
All the rare melee weapon mod plans (barbed walking cane, hatchet electro-fusion, etc)  
---
Assault Rifle plan  
---
Bear Arm plan and mod plans  
---
Stimpak Diffuser
---
And maybe throw in the rare event outfit lists for good measure. 
---
They could solve a lot of the problems by making them like the atlas provisions: non-sellable and non-droppable. Dupers at least wouldn't be able to distribute the gifts that way. And if they took the caps out of them it would also stop a lot of the duping.
---
The vendor descriptions should be modified:
---
1) Legendary Weapons
---
2) Legendary Armor
---
3) Weapons
---
4) Armor / Clothing
---
That change alone would help a ton.
---
You truly are a Cyber Legend!
---
I trust the guy, seems like he knows what hes doing
---
Double NAT type and strict
---
They were synthetic humans created by institute and emeny type in fallout 4. Also there was mission to save one in fallout 3
---
Having earned everything possible from running the raids, and enjoying the raids themselves.  I'm preparing myself to be disappointed.  The raids was the one thing in game that felt remotely challenging for me to do at end game.  
---
Since they are changing the mission and making it "explorer friendly"  I'm expecting something like the flop known as "the burrows"  something I'm gonna go through with no challenge, be in 10 minutes, and only go back to for specific daily challenges.
---
Well, you're right. OP can't tell other how to play, but they can complain about the choices others make when playing. 
---
Just as you have the right to price ammo over 1 cap, OP has the right to complain about it and not buy it. 
---
Personally I never buy ammo, I just bulk craft my own. So I sell all my extra ammo at just 1 cap, if you're selling higher then you might not sell as often as you would with a lower price.
---
I have 2, neither are locked.
---
You're right, it's their right to be profoundly unlikable people.
---
Nobody buys ammo at that rate, you're wasting your own stash space and everybody else's time. And if they do, you're ripping people off. It's a bad practice.
---
With ~~POS~~, sorry, **BOS** returning, now would be a perfect time for us Free Staters to return to kick their lily white asses back to CA.
---
i don‚Äôt even bother with player vending.  no one ever sells anything i want, and honestly, there‚Äôs not much that i need. ao don‚Äôt even bother selling, i‚Äôm sitting on bloodied and junkies weapons, and unyielding armor but i just can‚Äôt be bothered to put them up for sale, so to the scrip yard they go
---
I know, it was just a bad, corny joke :)
---
Ya, it's a shame there are such strict restrictions, although understandable in the sense that FO4 was single player.
---
Maybe they will be able to keep it locked up and we won't have to bring it back every day.
---
agreed.
---
This is actually a good observation, I hadn't thought of that, but still the conversion there doesn't work out.
---
I came across one CAMP, 4 full machines that I swear was just a Vendorbot running it. 30c Stims, Pipe Pistols, level 10 Leather Armor, random ass clothing, so many useless Mods, Junk - actual Junk, not Scrap. Not a single Legendary. No mounted plans though, but the Plans they did have were like "Heavy Leather Arms - 750c"
---
I got whooshed
---
All these items are crappy and not really worth anything.
---
That being said what plan are you looking for and have you tried the market subreddit you may find the plan from another player there cheaper
---
I meant, more open style camp. Like with those new Junk walls they released. I think it was Final Render that released a video like that, was pretty neat, might want to look at his videos for some ideas, then make it your own. Everyone can always use inspiration from others. Might spark some neat ideas for yourself.
---
When I'm looking for weapons, I check public teams to see if the camp owner is on one so I can quickly see what level they are. It helps cut down on the wasted trips.
---
I just hope the locations we go to are more than something like the GNR building quest from creation club, otherwise it won't be big enough to care.
---
It's out of control. Nobody is ever gonna buy ammo at that rate. Nobody's that desperate.
---
Only 550? Casual.
---
Never seen a truer post.
---
You‚Äôre being unlikable. And guess what. I sell lots of ammonia for more then 1 cap. 
---
You‚Äôre just a bully that is trying to get people to sell cheaper because your greedy.
---
Facts!
---
I share this sentiment. They have always been, and will always be my favorite Faction in Fallout.
---
That's probably the problem.
---
Yeah I know they suck lol but I was able to find some buyers to pick some of them and one guy paid 30k for the smg. I‚Äôm guessing he was just being a nice guy lol but I‚Äôm grateful, I got the plan after all. I‚Äôm just getting into this trading stuff and figuring out discord too lol
---
Better yet, just go hang out in a hospice.  
---
Hell, they should hinge an advertising campaign on the tagline "some other games are worse!"
---
Only difference in experience, they look different.  Its all cosmetic besides repair kits.
---
It was supposed to launch with Nuclear Winter. Last year...
---
I too enjoy this "feature" I recently rolled a nice Gauss shotgun, but damn it's too finicky for me. I always end up switching back to something with more dps when things get busy
---
I had that game on Ps4, never cared to play it online. As single player it's really nice with wonderful graphics.
---
You mean other games have problems?!? Next you‚Äôll telling even Animal Crossing had duping problems!?!?! Oh yeah it does!!
---
Daily Ops are gonna be like dungeons basically
---
The simplest thing you can do is assign your Xbox a static IP address and put that address into your router's DMZ. That puts your Xbox outside the firewall just to let you know.
---
I've done this before and never had a problem with it being in the DMZ but wanted to let you know.
---
You pick up a fan.  You need to loot 180 more items from the world (not containers) before you will be even able to see that fan, if it is there.  Containers I think is 120, I always for that one.
---
I know, I'm just screaming into the void. At least the first month or so it was a gritty apocalypse.
---
Not a very experienced MMOish player, but a central marketplace in the world would solve this problem without outside marketsubs and such for most players. Or if it was possible to automate a pricecheck bot based on sold items.
---
But but what about the gauss fatman or gauss nader?
---
I sunk thousands of hours into Fallout 4, I‚Äôve sunk a thousand hours into 76. This ain‚Äôt 4 and it took me three separate restarts on 76 to understand I was playing an MMO and not a RPG. Once I began to understand the differences it took off as my main game to play.
---
"I'm sorry to do this, but we need all your missiles and mininukes. We know it will never be enough, but we can compensate you"
---
I've played consistently for 2 years, and still haven't hit 1k hours. I don't think it was added as an "actual" achievable goal.
---
Because here we use the word space for the space on a drive, and Data is the amount of data being transmitted.
---
It's just strange for me to redefine words and introduce inaccuracy where there was clarity before. But that might just be me.
---
Must be fantastic to be this disillusioned with the real world.
---
Add it to the list of features that got cut because bethesda pushed an unfinished game so they could capitalize on the holiday season. We may see it in the future, but I doubt we will see it in the next road map release(the one after all the BoS stuff).
---
Tardy to the party
---
The main problem and I still don‚Äôt understand why it hasn‚Äôt been fixed.....is the broken weapons working unintentionally good and the basically god mode exploit since DAY 1!!!! How can anyone take this game seriously when builds don‚Äôt even matter! Just pick up a broken weapon that isn‚Äôt even suited for your build and you can solo the queen in a min or two while also never dying from the other exploit
---
"I rip people off by selling overpriced ammo all the time. You're just being greedy."
---
k
---
Lemme know when your vendors are open
---
Pre beta railroad
---
Wow. Ever heard about the search option?
---
I'm speculating, but I'm thinking they're just alternating equipment types between upgrades. So I'm not holding out for any heavy weapons in the next one, but I'm guessing a couple of different rifle types and maybe an explosive type (lol).
---
I don‚Äôt sell anything. I‚Äôm not a vendor. Whenever I need to do the daily challenge of buying/selling 3 items I just do that with gf so we both get credit for it. 
---
There‚Äôs people out there like myself running around with 30,000 caps and nothing to spend on it. 
---
So whenever I‚Äôm running low on shotgun Shells I go buy some. Most people sell it for 1 cap each. And that‚Äôs great. I‚Äôll literally buy every shotgun shell they have for sale, or up to 1,400 caps because I know I can easily go and farm weapons under 30 minutes and go make that money back. I‚Äôll even pay up to 2 caps. That‚Äôs reasonable. I think people are just so used to getting cheap and free stuff that they love to complain about having to spend caps. 
---
Fast travel with travel agent to a super mutant area. Or if you‚Äôre too cheap to pay for fast travel, either walk there or join a public team and hope that a teammate or their camp is somewhere nearby.  Almost every super mutant has between 4-10 caps on them when you kill them. Plus their weapons you can sell. Let‚Äôs just pretend for a second that the guy is selling ammo for 5 caps each. Buy 3 of them. It will only cost you 15 caps. Which you will definitely make up in less than 5 minutes.
---
Since fallout 3, this has always been my favorite part of playing. Finding the little "stories" of what happened here and unraveling them.
---
golf balls and baseballs are all i know scraps into it. i expect many who want to help will be raiding whitesprings.
---
All i see are duped xmas plans and 2 star gear all at insane prices, last night i saw icicle lights for 2k caps! I even saw large holiday gifts for thousands its a joke they didnt purge these inventories that dupe destroyed the already bad player vending.
---
I'd like to add GTA V online for consideration. What a hot mess. An abomination.

No problem! Hope you get it sorted.

they expect nukashine i bet. and sadly making a sign that says "free nuka col! not nukashine!" would juat be more suspicious.
---
I had to settle for screen shots, I'd love a poster in game!
---
I was about to say the same... I've been told they took them out because of players making trap camps and causing players to Fast Travel directly into the trap for instant death
---
The whole game is a huge glitching bug.

I don't have pacifist mode on so can't be that

Beauty run. Love the gauss mini.

This is true.

Ya i want to do a shotguns build but getting through armor seems to be its problem. I'm finally to the point now where I can solo legendary scorchbeasts . But they are tough even with my rifle.

It could have been amazing, but they‚Äôve put no support behind it in the time since the beta. People playing that game really know what it‚Äôs like to be ignored.

i also like how different groups of the BoS have different ideals. Roger Maxson wanted to gather tech and information to help future societies rebuild, but his successors decided to just hoard it and cut themselves off from others. Lyons wanted to stop focusing on tech and help the capital wasteland against supermutants. Taggerdy did what Maxson told her, until she diverted all focus to fighting the Scorched. and Arthur Maxson tried to combine his ancestor's ideals and Lyons', but in doing so became a massive asshole.
---
it shows that even one group can be different things based on who's in charge.
---
Cork isn‚Äôt that hard to obtain, just farm the forest and ash heap for low level scorched. Round up all the pipe pistols and pipe rifles and throw on scrapper perk card. Scrap em all and boom easy cork and a little exp.
---
i mean there not really any way to get proof but i quit the game it has to many issues and bugs that should have been long fixed. and i can do basic math 1050 + 80 = 1130 not 1090
---
Yeah, I understand what you mean. I‚Äôm sure game both takes up space and uses a lot of data. Maybe they meant both with a single word. But the main problem with the game is that it is BIG.
---
lol.. what are you keeping 400+ cork for?
---
I dont think ive ever kept more than 75-100 without selling the rest off...
---
If you are on Xbox your welcome to use my private server. I don't need any materials, I'll just do my daily stuff.
---
Also crystal decanters and if you have the scrapper perk pipe weapons give cork
---
&gt; I lean towards exclusivity, I don't want everyone to have everything,
---
They paid for the game, they should get the items in the game

I actually squealed when I discovered this quest. I have loved Mistress of Mystery since Fallout 4. The character herself is amazing and the ballsy attitude of Shannon Rivers (Fallout 4 recordings) makes me love her so much. There is so much that could be done with the lair. It is a pity it is wasted.
---
why are known plans filtered to the top of the sort? They are intentionally sorted to the top.
---
Someone bought every mounted head plan in my vendor yesterday. No idea why, but it freed up like 20 weight in my stash so I'm not complaining.
---
I know the feeling those two are going through. lol.
---
When Wastelanders dropped I played through the expansion doing missions for both sides, waiting for the inevitable hammer to fall and I had to chose one.  Made my choice and the consequence was...nothing.  Hit the vault with a specific group of people, had the option to give them gold or keep it, then go on my merry way.
---
Maybe BoS is less forgiving if you cross them?
---
At the same time I could see the NPCs not complaining too much.  We are the general of the Enclave and can launch nukes at our leisure. The raiders live in a crashed space station and all of Foundation is being maintained by Ward...those poor bastards.
---
Or..  controversial theory.. they are "fudging" the numbers, or screwed up somehow. Haha And the numbers are not accurate. Or the more likely scenario, people couldn't be bothered to do it.
---
I heard from somewhere in this subreddit that by scrapping pipe weapons with the scrapper card you get some cork. I did not confirm on my own yet, but I vaguely remember that being a thing.
---
you said the D-word, that‚Äôs a permanent ban. Sorry it‚Äôs just the rules.

For fluids and masses, bring along a bloatfly syringer. Shoot one thing with the syringer, then kill it, bloatfly spawns, shoot it with the syringer, kill it, another bloatfly, repeat, profit.
---
Also gives you plenty of glands, so it also produces acid.
---
Simple fix - make the fast travel point only work for the camp owner.
---
Holy shit. That explains so much. I appreciate it. So world items respawn every 24 hours assuming I've grabbed 180 items since the last time I came to a particular spawn. Am I understanding that correctly?
---
Never ever, people had been asking something as simple as "a way to get the OoM items back because I dropped/scrapped them" aaaand nothing.

Another case of wasted potential, hopefully now that we have human NPCs in the future we'll get more factions/quest even if they are mino compared with the main ones. Heck we have all these mothman cultists all over the place and not a single payout, the encryptid chain quests were pretty good and I hope they do something similar with the Mothman Cult or the Interloper
---
Hey, yeah! Thatd be brilliant :) we would love to take you up on your offer. If you let me know what your GT is me and my friend can join your game. Thanks a bunch!
---
Having recently finished the legendary run I usually only log in to grab daily bullion, scrip limit and cap limit from vendors. Don‚Äôt get me wrong tho I still love the game but it‚Äôs been a long grind and I‚Äôve been neglecting modern warfare. I completely skipped season 4 so now I‚Äôm doing a lot of catching up with that game.
---
Which 4 glitches are there? I'm digging to find a solution to mine
---
I don‚Äôt have the perk but I scrapped a pipe weapon today for some cork. Maybe you get more with the perk?
---
A centralized market would certainly help, but the problem is that in-game currency simply can‚Äôt buy the top end guns that everyone wants.  By and large, they‚Äôre trade only for other top tier equipment.  If you can find a bloody fixer for caps, you‚Äôre very lucky.
---
Gamers have such cool slang! POGGERS!
---
But I have so many legit mounted head plans just sitting in my stash, unlisted because it takes so fucking long to list shit!
---
Edit: but seriously, the next time I'm adding stuff to my vendors, I'm listing as many as I can for 5 caps each.
---
Perhaps! I'll update if / when I scrap one.
---
And a scribe that accepts all forbidden knowledge
---
My partner made a secret OoM mansion camp!
---
My problem is my camp is in the forest, so people glance over my camp and see that I have 43 weapons for sale and assume they are worthless junk. Little do they know, they are all 3*and no bashing bs.
---
I was wrong, there's more than 4 of them, usually the solution is to either be in a team and respawn on them, or close down the game entirely!
---
That is genius. Thanks for the brilliant advice :)
---
And globes.
---
I do exactly this.
---
Oh yes lovely globes!
---
Reminds me of fishing in World of Warcraft and Minecraft.
---
Just as boring in game as it is in real life.
---
I generally go where my team feels the most comfortable but I enjoy dropped by the overpass in the town at the big garage or at the back of the power plant but I don‚Äôt mind dropping at the steelyard because there‚Äôs plenty of loot there as well. With penitentiary it feels like either no one goes there or half the server does. But the same can be said for power plant
---
I think if you examine enough female bodies it triggers. That's what happened with me.
---
Hold the phone, they don't take cork to build?
---
Ever since getting Aquaboy perk, in the middle of Grafton Lake.
---
Nope no cork at all, its a flat cork profit
---
Never saw that site, and now i see where the Beth devs go to get ideas on proper UI ux
---
Christmas coins, or Hanukkah gelt.
---
Yea it's setup nice for that.  I wish I could take more workshops but I swear, every single time I do, either my friends want to jump servers for some stupid reason.  
---
Bugs it is for me!
---
this. when i start to think our community has it bad, i just stroll to that sub. makes me feel a tad better. but not enough to forgive how much of a mess this game can be.
---
thx
---
Yeah, Ive played since beta, I did this the Order quests so long ago. Id LOVE more with them! Huge that they haven't touched on this at all.
---
Absolutely yes please. That hidden passage discovery was the most exciting thing.
---
&gt;  it's very unlikely the goal would be met due to the fact people don't see a reason to do it in the first place.
---
No.   This is absolutely wrong. Go back and read my original post. I said that the concrete farming hot spots are always empty. That means that people are looting it and turning it in. 
---
People are willing to turn it in. That is not the problem. The problem is that it is not on the map to be farmed 75 percent of the  time.
---
I'd love for them to add content on existing material, but then they need to be splashy with the BOS to drive players.
---
The Camden amusement park, more faction with between Settlers and Raiders (conflict between them), more with the Super Mutants, and then the Mysteries. The questline is heartbreaking and it'd be great to start rebuilding them.
---
I‚Äôve heard the 24 hours but I‚Äôve not experienced it.  In theory if you take that fan, grab 180 more items, and server hop to where that fan should be, then it‚Äôll be there if nobody else grabbed it. 24 hours has nothing to do with it, again as per my own experience.  It‚Äôs tough to tell with items that everyone grabs, like fans, outside of a private server.
---
I'm not spending ¬£12+ on that junk lol makes me laugh as I recorded this and edited it all around the 30th The bundle didn't even come out by that point, not sure how long you take making videos but it isn't quick
---
LMAO, "good pvp" and 20 tickrate servers dont mix
---
Well, I know what I am doing tonight.
---
Or selling everything at face value. Look on the map and think to myself ‚ÄúDAMN 273 plans?! I gotta check it out!‚Äù  Only to find out they‚Äôre charging entirely too much which would explain why they have that many plans in their vending machine in the first place.
---
Unfortunately you can‚Äôt only In fo4
---
Yep... after doing my dailies yesterday, I log out and switch over to RDR2. I see its downloaded an update and installed. I log in... PS4 blue screen of death. Do it again... same result. Got on the internet to see the RD online community in a major uproar. To say R* screwed the pooch would be a vast understatement! Broke the game into something unrecognizable. It was then I realized that R* makes Bethesda look saintly (in offering private servers... because players on RD Online would give up their firstborn for that option) and freaking geniuses!
---
That‚Äôs the best thing that came out of this
---
People dont even use the legendary fat mans theyre so terrible
---
After browsing their subreddit, I‚Äôll double down on the no meme posts here.   Saying the same thing as everyone else but using a different meme to accomplish it is not creative.
---
Yeah I was thinking that the market would enable trading and leaving wanted posters for weapons. So you could see thousands of people looking for b2525 fixers üòÖ
---
So its gonna be something I clear (again) once in like 5-10 minutes, then visit daily for the challenge.  Basically the change I've described that is the reason I'm preparing for/expecting a giant disappointment.
---
Cant wait to get some end game content that isn't just  "M1 until dead" again, but at this rate it will never happen.
---
Wow.... I actually found some sacks of concrete on my travels last night (I was at about quantity 130).  I thought to myself...wow, I may actually get to donate once!  Scrapped it, came to about 180.  I gave up LOL
---
I think free states will be an antagonistic faction to Enclave. BoS May be technologically a greater equal but Free States represent a true antagonist to everything Enclave stands for. Plus Sam Blackwells relation to Free States/targeted by Enclave can be a major factor.
---
I‚Äôd just like it to be accurately giving ammo.
---
Not flares when I wanted railway spikes...
---
I remember reading that even though Atoms are platform based (ie Atoms on Steam can't be used on XBGP), characters are not, they're tied with the Bethesda account, meaning that even if you change from one platform to another (on the same console/pc), you will be able to use the same character. Just wanted to confirm to be sure.
---
Damn
---
Wierd good stuff?.. so like what? Bigfoot?.. have you not played other Fallout games? Becuase what your suggesting pretty far from what a Fallout game would be.
---
Its a very nice community and I'm glad you got your plan and lot of caps
---
If you own the vault tec generator or the compact skin there is a way to fix the ghost 10%.
---
Why not just ask Next Gen consoles?
---
Sounds like the vats bug then. Throw it on the pile with the other bugs.
---
Yes! Expand on stuff already in the game! There are so many good stories already in the game that they could expand on. They don't need to go back to the old factions.
---
This reminds me of Gotham tv show. When it came out they said it wasn't Batman's story. It wasn't even Bruce's story. It was Gordon's and Gotham's story. But viewers couldn't handle that so the show had to introduce Batman instead of making something new.
---
Ah, yes! I remember you! Thrilled that you enjoyed my camp :)
---
It takes up less budget than a turret, so for this guy to have 10% locked away means they had *alot* of Ammo Machines
---
Here is another bad camp visit scenario. Find a vendor with a Legendary 3* Junkie I've been searching months for. Just as I am about to buy it... he logs out! Noooooo!!!!!!
---
You can even buy the Tricentennial paints separately, at least on PS4. It was on sale a few weeks back for like 5 USD.
---
It was my post you saw, and I was wrong, you don't need scrapper to get the cork.
---
You can get cork from pipe weapons without the perk. Scrapper doesn‚Äôt give you anything extra, rather it gives you more of what you would already scrap. It kinda annoyed me when I got this perk early thinking it would help me get screws and such but nope.
---
That massive stash yields 90 concrete scrap. Another 120 at Bogtown, without extractors, and another 4 at New River gorge bridge means 250 concrete scrap costs as much as 100 caps in fast travel and at least one clip of ammo.
---
They had this in the BETA but the problem I can see from this is all the people who make trap camps will just trap you in a death room or even random players can just spawn you in a locked room or torture you, etc etc.
---
With all the broken/duped weapons out there...hell no.
---
The pvp in adventure mode is garbage.
---
You a real OG
---
The power plant is my favorite spot, but it‚Äôs usually contested. There is a lot of loot there.
---
Monongah mine has about a dozen crates in the fire, and power armor occasionally spawns in the warehouse.
---
South of the university near the bridge is good. I try to gain high ground immediately; there are a lot of crates up there. I think Morgantown is relatively safe if your team controls the high ground and snipes everyone.
---
The penitentiary is good. I feel that this spot is underrated, since I frequently take it uncontested. I try to take the roof as soon as possible since the best crates are up there and any enemies below are at a disadvantage.
---
The airport has a lot of crates, and petrified corpses give loot. That being said, I feel like this place is a death trap and I try to loot and leave quickly.
---
I wouldn't be against them having gold rewards similar to the SS and Foundation etc.
---
i just quit again been playing with non stop bugs, glitches and the game just not working the way it says it should. imo not wroth getting back into it
---
Yeah. I would have loved for it to be closer to its roots, but alas.
---
That could be interesting too - what if they ran a running gold total... of who has the highest gold reserves?  (aka, who do we spend the most gold with?)
---
Rank 93 here...def taking a break once im done with it this week. 
---
the XP repeatable was the main reason i got so far. Some days i hit it 15-20 times.
---

---
look i'm just wanting a atom shop version of the garb of mysteries, that's actually that nice evening dress instead of whatever that was that we got in game. :3
---
As far as I know there hasn't been any announcement of it but it seems likely considering the game is going to be supported past the date of next gen consoles coming out.
---
?
---
Um...I'll take some of those junkies off your hands. I'm prepping that build.
---
This is what I am running. Haven't touched a bloodied weapon in weeks. Have just been using junkies stuff and imo they kills faster.
---
I‚Äôm genuinely surprised they haven‚Äôt done that yet.
---
Dunno. I've seen people saying on here that each one takes up 2% budget. I don't have any and don't really care to fact check an issue that doesn't impact me, so idk.
---
Why not ask here, it applies to this game?
---
It‚Äôs a specific female body in a black dress with greenish wave stripes across it. The AVR pointer is the best for new players as it‚Äôs on the main story.
---
You seeing spots looted doesn't equal it all being turned in, plenty of people still lot areas for their own reasons. You're seeing something and claiming it equals something without anything to support that.
---
-Seek help.
---
I actually revisited Riverside Manor for the first time last night for the first time in the roughly 240 levels I have gained since my last visit.   I was hoping I could re-craft the unique items to add to my collection, but I was sorely disappointed.   
---
In fact, I couldn't even get into the lower levels initially, despite having the mask equipped, which was very annoying.   Thankfully,  a server-hop took care of that.
---
Tbh i don't know my self lol.
---
That quest line alone was worth enduring all the bugs and glitches up to that point.
---
Don't forget to run with butchers bounty!
---
Yes but no one can come and destroy your fun when you fight a dragon in Skyrim while some high level with duped legacy / magic items can come and kill the SQB you nuked for in 10 scds in FO76.
---
So yeah, nothing to compare, even if I agr√©√© that FO76 is everything but a MMO RPG.
---
Or a new way of depositing technical data which changes the reward based on who you give it to
---
Paladin- higher chance of paint schemes
---
Science scribe- higher chance of chems 
---
Engineer scribe- higher chance of mods
---
Field Scribe- higher chance of outfits
---
I kept all my stuff! You lose it if you don't. Super sad. You can upgrade their levels ive been told.
---
I had one from a friend who placed it in mine.
---
Its gone now once i redesigned my camp shortly after but i see the tiniest of slivers as grey. Not even 1%. Putting FashMasks on display took up more budget than it.
---
So 10% gone? Thats a bunch of machines
---
No, I'm saying I triggered the storyline before seeing any of the mistresses. Mine triggered at the Morgantown airport.
---
They announced it for doom and eso. So was hoping for a fallout announcement
---
There's no NCR armour, only Charleston Police Department ranger armour
---
Wish I had known that a year ago... üòÅ
---
All of the above?
---
Rip im a herbivore
---
They know how to make it they just don't have the ultracite
---
I just figured they were unique
---
I've found it's a lot of newer players from the game pass that don't know the value of things, so they guess. I've jumped in a party with a few of them to let them know a bit more about realistic pricing, most are receptive but others don't care. It's definitely made it harder to go to camps and stock up on things like ammo when they've priced. 38 rounds for 3 caps ea.
---
Option C! Do it for the Boys!
---
You have a legitimate strategy for winning/killing. 
---
QS exploiters, and noob tubers are the scum
---
That‚Äôs a great point.
---
I‚Äôve always viewed the BoS as more an embodiment of the era and location we‚Äôre in with each game. It‚Äôs interesting to see how each group functions based on where they‚Äôre located and what time period we meet them. Whether they‚Äôre a techno-cult with less, sorts fascists looking for almost enclave levels of biological purists, or inbred isolationists. It may be fan service but I also think it‚Äôs a very striking identifier of the troubles each region and decade face, and how an organization united under a small group of guiding principles can manipulate them into such different ways.
---
Hopefully we can just turn it over to the Brotherhood lol I'd happily sacrifice my ally status as I already have the Foundation rewards
---
Something my friend actually discovered is that holding back backs out of the entire thing. Dunno if it only works on Xbox or not though
---
Find the nearest open mic night at a comedy club, and share your gift with the world.
---
soon
---
Most people I see making this complaint are also unhappy that visitors end up in weird spots as well.
---
I'd be more worried that they don't like fact im a glowing mutant.
---
Why don't Beth just use the same method to avoid traps close to spawn loc that they used to keep players from setting up at marked locations?
---
Traps can't be closer than [whatever value] to spawn door mat.
---
I will donate all my concrete
---
Totally underrated story and quest line of FO76. Hell,, not even a reoccurring event to this great story line, but as someone else said let's go ahead AGAIN with BoS. It's all about selling shit for the Devs at this point. Also it's cheaper to continue to pull from old, tired content, just asked Bungie.
---
Would be nice that fireworks plan, used them up after queen fights to show appreciation
---
I finished and loved the grind! First time that I haven‚Äôt done dailies and feels weird. So I‚Äôve just been working on my camp and chillin, feels good üòâ
---
Can‚Äôt wait till next season!! More free stuff üòã
---
This Jeep has been in my photos for a while too. 
---
You can find them all over and me and my friends have one from low to high level like a reunion photo.
---
snap, i sell all the heads at 50 caps each and have sold out on a few of them atleast a few sold each server
---
Drop bags of concrete and old corks in the reception area üëç
---
When the fast travel bug hits try travelling to another close location, or move a little and reload your gun then try again.
---
OMG!!! Too bad I didn't think of that... On a side note of that train of thought: I've always wanted to leave a Nukashine at the entrance of the vault, in hopes that a true newbie would consume it... and watch to see where they end up on the map! ü§£ It'd be even funnier if someone was close by, with a flaming chainsaw and Raider mask, to go running at them while screaming into their mic...
---
Why am I getting arson vibes from this post?
---
It‚Äôs nowhere near as buggy and broken as this... It‚Äôs very *very* pay to win but if you‚Äôre like me, a dedicated grinder (even I can‚Äôt grind 76 anymore, it‚Äôs just killed me, as has GTA, but then again I have all the tools I need to kill people) you can earn your way into the rich list.
---
Thanks dupers for your rewards. Like it or not
---
Its the new norm.  People were always assholes in public events but I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs gotten worse since SCORE got introduced.
---
Yes, especially with Line in the Sand.
---
Hmm seems odd to me(PC player). I haven‚Äôt played the new Atlas update, but that shouldn‚Äôt affect events. I‚Äôve actually been saying they‚Äôve improved since public team queuing! I‚Äôd suggest hopping in one. That way at least it‚Äôs a bit more shared experience!
---
EDIT: Legendary slaughtering is still a thing. Sometimes get burned by that.
---
The Order of Mysteries was the only Fallout 76 questline that felt like ‚ÄúFallout.‚Äù
---
They should just make it one mechanic where you go down and can be revived. How they can put two dying mechanics in a game but can't do other simple tasks is beyond me.
---
I feel the same when I hit 600. I‚Äôm at 599 and like 7/8. Been a long almost two years lol
---
I still user low dmg weapons in events, and always just tag the mob, I even wonder sometimes if ppl will think I'm cheaping out on ammo
---
I see some ppl in events including my buddies in a competition to do the most damage and I wonder why in events, go do it somewhere else where one players will not be harmed by it
---
The plan was to see how much bethesda could get away with.
---
The real mvp
---
The brotherhood will show up and thank us for donating all the materials still because there is no way the dev's care enough to record dialogue for in case we didn't hit the goals
---
I‚Äôm a fan of both and tbh, I think I need some help because these games are BROKEN
---
And we just got it. Great play everyone!! We forced them to reconsider......wait what‚Äôs that you say? They didn‚Äôt readjust the cork down from 200 million??????? Never mind guys we still have to yell at them some more.
---
The apartment one made me chuckle. 
---
A wise man once said -"Do it. Just-do-it.....DO IT!!!
---
Because last I checked PS5 will be coming out as well and both systems support backwards compatibility and both systems can offer an upgrade.
---
lmao
---
 It into the current state of vending, BUT do keep a crapload of ammo at 1cap so no one needs to spend more that 3 caps to complete the ‚Äúbuy 3 items from another player‚Äù
---
Easy fix. Fast travel back to previous location instantly and can't take damage for 30 seconds after fast traveling into a camp.they already have something like this at every fast travel point where enemies do not aggro for about 15 seconds or so while loading in.
---
 I actually like the surprise and ingenuity that trap camps give me in game, but the point is to trick or stumble upon these not PORT into them.
---
Depending on the event. I‚Äôm not letting a ghoul get by because the guys we have to defend die quickly and we lose our chance of getting the best reward reward. Uranium Fever I still get out my 10mm to tag and then ‚ÄúCome here‚Äù emote for all legendaries. 
---
It also has to do with the fact that most people have god tier weapons after the recent dupe. Two shots with my Bloody Explosive Fixer and everything is down.
---
the dumbest of luck
---
Walk in and as how the managed to avoid having exposed metal on their interior walls.
---
The blast is not that bad, what kills me is the melee.
---
&gt; But the main problem with the game is that it is BIG.
---
70 GB is not big imho, but also nothing you get on a whim. I think it's one of the smaller sized games out there.
---
With 1 level Goat Legs perk and Chinese Stealth, I've taken minimal damage when falling off a mountain cliff.  Then same when jumping from a pylon... and no Bird Bones mutation.
---
Not always. Yesterday did Free Range. There was 6 of us. Everyone played right. Couple of players guided the Brahmin and the rest protected them.
---
When the Sheepsquach appeared we all got hits on it and it wasn‚Äôt one shot.
---
Bloodied or junkies.   Take ur pick
---
Nope they will remain. Bethesda has to muddy the waters per se of the loot pool so we can't get the 1-2 new items added with less than 1% vhance to get.
---
I'm pretty sure that is why they need the other 135 million concrete.  Finally someone with the guts to build a fort knox for bonesaws!
---
I'm really annoyed/frustrated that for both rdr2 &amp; gta5 - all of the updates came through online play.
---
I'd have loved more stories/content
---
Old bug. Most people I know call it the windego effect. It gets really weird when you are holding certain weapons and the mods are positioned all over the place. Like here http://imgur.com/a/dRV52wZ
---
I use the Escape key to exit
---
They still have cork listed at 200. Here's hoping they realize that maybe 2 mil is a more realistic number. Cork is one of the lowest farmed items. 
---
Now the real question is, did the person who initially set the numbers fuck up because they didn't properly understand how junk counts works in the game and thought 150 is more than 125 let's really ramp it up with next random junk item showing a complete detachment from daily gameplay experience
---
OR did they just quietly try to clean up realizing after the fact that there's absolutely no way this goal would be met and didn't want to face the backlash of people not getting the rewards because goals were set with unrealistic expectations. 
---
All other previous "goals" were things players would already do and so doing more of it is reasonable and perhaps even enjoyable. Setting goals that would require the vast majority of players to break their routines, especially while still expecting them to do the dailies grind, just set up the whole thing for failure before it even began.
---
That's awesome. I lost my crap when it actually picked it up!!!
---
pipe weapons, you say....
---
*sets raider collectron to gathering weapons*
---
As far as I know, the only legendary with a minimum damage requirement is the Scorchbeast Queen. Any other legendary only needs you to cause any damage of some sort. 
---
I've also not heard of corpses giving messages that you didn't damage them enough.
---
Stealth commando with auto fixer or handmade.
---
I do say
---
There is a static spawn for it on west tek
---
I‚Äôve actually had success selling junkies, bloodied, unyielding, and even vanguard. But then again, I price stuff to move. Only sought after prefixes ever go in the machine ...  Armor at 500 caps or less, and weapons averaging 1000caps, maybe a tad higher for good rolls and definitely less for weaker rolls. Ammo goes quick at a cap per, plasma cores for around 10 caps. I only stock rare plans, but try to keep these priced low as well. Rare clothing as I get it, but again, priced lower than I should. You might want to try vending for a week or two, clear out the inventory some, and then shut it down. Just a thought.
---
It's easy to get one as there is a spawn on top of West-Tec.
---
Getting one from the machines is ridiculous low though.
---
Yes, I know it‚Äôs not one of the biggest. But still, 70 is a huge number. And there were complaints about its size and the updates‚Äô size in the beginning. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre referring to.
---
I assume they will update it soon. and then we be able to whip 'em out boys, because we did it.
---
I personally love visiting camps regardless. I go there knowing I may not find anything, but I still have the fun of checking out what sort of interesting things they have on display. I‚Äôve seen so much cool stuff: hilarious signs, surprise deathclaw pets, great outfits for 10 caps, incredible views that make great photo ops, silly decorations that give me a laugh, not to mention maybe meeting the camp owner and saying hello. One time I met another player that was wearing the exact same outfit and hair color/hairstyle. Had to take a picture of that! And the feeling of finding that thing you were looking for is the best! And let‚Äôs not forget that team member camps are free fast travel spots!
---
Nothing wrong with that. When I hit 100 a week ago I cut my play time 90%. I go on now simply to do scrip caps and bullion.
---
I assume OP meant from the machine.
---
Charelston, Morgantown, Harper‚Äôs Ferry/The Burrows and Tanagra Town are all great places to farm flux processing materials, Especially Tanagra with the cricket respawn ability. When you‚Äôre making stable flux, I recommend a day or two of farming the masses and fluids. If you have room in your stash box. That way you can plan out your production run and know exactly how much stable flux you‚Äôre going to be able to make.
---
Damn I got it twice in one day from the machine
---
There‚Äôs a twist, once they arrive they‚Äôll ask why nukes are being set off. Atlas guy says it‚Äôs the seven sixers. ‚ÄúHmm I see, and you have been helping them?!‚Äù Pistol execution. 
---
‚ÄúNow then, let‚Äôs eradicate these vault dwellers!‚Äù
---
It would be exactly like the market sub.
---
If i see a tent out front i holster my gun and just wait for my treasury notes.
---
I'll recommend acid, as you can mine lead and iron.  I've encountered that I'm most limited by a lack of gunpowder.  So, the acid is used in smelting the ore and in making gunpowder.
---
My CAMP is on the acid node SW of Wavy Willard's.  The extractor is only part of the acid resources though, as my turrets net me Yao Guai bodies.  There's also room for the large Water Purifiers.
---
I love where I live.
---
or they take over my camp that's just across the road
---
I don‚Äôt think you understood what I was talking about. Someone being able to use broken weapons doesn‚Äôt change my original point, which was the mechanics of the fight. Magic items don‚Äôt change mechanics, only the difficulty to kill the enemy. Which was really just as easy to break in Skyrim with the right setup.
---
Sounds like you have a network problem, especially if others aren't experiencing issues. Not sure why you're trying to tag people at Bethesda first.
---
I play both and it seems to just flip flop which one is a shitshow.
---
It's like Bethesda and Rockstar get together and coordinate.
---
"We'll break our game this week and we'll let you know when it's "fixed" so you can break yours."
---
Out of the machine? Fairly hard. From the guaranteed spawn on the roof of West Tek? Fairly easy.
---
[This site even has the formula the game uses to determine the odds of getting it.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Perfectly_preserved_pie_(Fallout_76)
---
I'm making this all in jest of course, but it does make me wonder if they get weirdos there from time to time?
---
Also, can I mention as a side note, that I just moved here for work and how wierd it is seeing how accurate FO3 was on DC geographically.  That on top of being so close to West Virginia and the FO76 landmarks, AND the studio so close...üòÜ...im deep in it.

Had a low level try that once. So I locked him inside my house with a Level 3 lock. Then went into build mode and placed down punji boards on every open space on my floor. The only safe place for him was standing on my bed. Took him a while to figure out that he could just Fast Travel out of there! ü§£
---
Me too.  Nothing wrong with throwing that bit of information out though.
---
What does that build look like?  I'm running something I'd describe along those lines and it's great against most enemies, but I'm not doing anywhere near the damage against bigger targets (the Queen, the Wendigo Colossus, etc.) that the bloodied or junkies builds do.
---
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting downvoted. You‚Äôre speaking the truth maybe that‚Äôs why. Builds literally don‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm not specced for shotties yet I run around one shotting legendaries with a station pump because of broken magic damage. It‚Äôs silly. Only thing to do is ignore the exploits and try to play ‚Äúnormally‚Äù but then you get your experience ruined by other people who exploit the exploits. So to avoid that you have to pay for a private server...and then you‚Äôre just playing by yourself in a game that‚Äôs meant to be played with other people...ugh it‚Äôs frustrating sometimes.

[coconut clip-cloppiing intensifies]
---
You have inspired me to make my camp better then before not sure what all I can do now that they removed some of the camp building glitches but im not gonna let that stop me.
---
What weapons should I pick With the two? Rifles, heavies, shotties?
---
Well my friend, my shop is just for you, I just started clearing out the junk I have saved up again. Put up a bunch of bulk junk on the weekend.
---
Yeah no, it was just intentionally made bad in order to slow us down and make the process cumbersome so that we continue to get ammo in other ways. If the ammo converter were quick and user friendly there'd be no reason to use the Armco ammo factory or craft regular ammo anymore, you'd just be able go out then dump anything you got quickly into the machine to get what you needed. That's the reason it wasn't improved by much when we complained, they just dialed back the cumbersomeness ever so slightly and fixed one little thing that was actually a UI bug.
---
Cheers
---
I just throw grenades and hope for the best.
---
Do bullets wasted, dead weight gone, possible XP. Win win win.
---
Ports forwarded? Firewall off / Rules in place?
---
10/10!
---
Agreed. That I still have not overcome she usually doesn't come at you until that recharge point, but I have no idea how you would take here out when she comes close enough to get those knife claws on you. If you don't have a ranged weapon Mayne there are some melee tips &amp; tricks out there?
---
&gt; Don't want to force people into PVP by making them actually choose a faction. I mean an online multiplayer game with PVP? Sheesh, why
---
So essentially you are proposing FvF (faction vs. Faction).
---
Which - I'd propose the DAoC model (RvR, or Realm vs. Realm).  Which equates to - 90% of the world is no pvp.  in the 10% that is designated as such, you can fight other factions.
---
This supports people who want to PvP, and not simply gank people
---
Why worked just fine before I wiped it with only the default installation what changed during this process to suddenly require this now after over a year of it being fine since the 76 launch?
---
I support and promote awareness of them with my flair every time i post :D
---
But if I equip Glow Sight I have to unequip Tank Killer or Concentrated Fire.
---
Nuke the nukes.
---
The BoS will need some caps to trade for supplies they don't have, like a regular source of crops
---
don't worry about it, I canceled my three FO1st subscriptions, it's not a problem for me anymore, I've moved on.   
---
it is clear you are not community first, if you were, things like the ammo converter or patch 21 would never have happened the way they did. Can we talk about the atlas supply expectation failure here?  
---
You wouldn't sit with known exploits being activity used and would engage the community about not using them instead of staying silent and then waving the ban hammer days / weeks later.
---

---
It seems designed in such a way as to avoid the UI from needing to scroll. There must have been duping concerns.  Designing to thwart exploiters/hackers/rmt is the epitome of failed game design.
---
Lol just because you ended up with tens of thousands of duped presents doesn't mean everyone did. 
---
The mounted heads and everything else still sell constantly when priced appropriately. (Anywhere from 10-50 caps usually sell well when close to new player routes - on xb and pc especially with the flood of game pass players)
---
What people are really not getting is how the economy works and the balance of CAMP placement to goods offered. 
---
I think the easiest way to fix the problem for everyone is to have a more advanced vendor icon system breaking down the color code for rarity vs common (color a bar or line above the words based off percentage of whichever so if there's 20 items and 5 are rare, 15 are common you can visually see the 75/25 color split in a second and know what to expect)
---
Also ideally by splitting legendary and non legendary items as well as outfits from armor but I think the outfits one gets more complicated when some outfits can be given protection stats with mods like shielded etc.
---
While I‚Äôm not personally a fan of pvp (I‚Äôm just bad at it in general) what I mean is that the meta is unbelievably one sided, bloodied builds not only have weapons contributing directly to their build but armor, a mutation, and a countless number of perk cards dedicated to making them deal so much damage. The closest runner up is the junkie‚Äôs build, a build that is vastly outclassed in terms of damage, and after that there really aren‚Äôt any ‚Äúmeta‚Äù builds. And neither build is particularly interesting, both are just sacrificing something for damage. It‚Äôs lame.
---
‚óï‚Äø‚óï I hope you enjoy it!
---
All the new factions were really interesting. OoM like all the others have so much wasted potential. One of the reasons the shoehorning of the BoS back in is such a lazy choice and huge disappointment.
---
OoM don't even have a daily or anything. They do have a really cool secret base you have no reason to visit after the quest is finished tho.
---
Wow I feel stupid lucky looking at that formula. I just started playing so my luck stat is 1
---
I have the same issue. You need to plug something into your controller's headphone jack. You don't even need to use them, but apparently it fixes it.
---
We were still a couple million away before it switched to cork.... but we will see what happens...
---
Had a low level child join our team once and talked ENDLESSLY over the mic!!! Narrated everything he was doing. Changing gear, changing guns, etc... even followed us to a SBQ fight, and yaked and yaked and yaked during the entire event. Teammates started dropping out and jumping to other servers. At first I thought it was a girl but then realized he was a boy, whose voice hadn't changed yet. ü§£
---
All this plus the inspired choice of Claudia Christian \[aka Ivanova, *Babylon 5*\] to voice her
---
You all need to stop complaining about this. Go play the game.
---
(Todd Face)
---
I agree, more consequences would be more meaningful and interesting but hopefully not buggy. 
---
Like the wayward with the free radicals is kool because you can kill them but then you never get the mask, not game changing in anyway and more conversation options.
---
Oh wow. Thanks bro
---
Guided Meditation, Radiation Rumble and Lin in the Sand, these 3 Events give a shit ton of xp
---
I hit 90 sometime last week, and now somewhere around the same point 93-ish I think.  Now that I'm so far ahead with plenty of time left I'm only logging in on Tuesdays to bash out the weekly challenges and that day's dailies and calling it good to reach the goal.
---
I know I play it is can't do any of the missions involving npcs oh wait it's all of them. Can't do bounty hunting, the new naturalist roll (what a sh*t show). No animals to hunt for the trader role. R* at their finest ruining a pretty good game due to their fixation on gta online and not being able to understand what the community wants in a cowboy game. 
---
'Oh I want to get samples from animals and preserve nature.' A bank heist or train heist would be great.
---
Why would they? It wouldn't even make sense for them to care, in order for them to care what your reputation was with the Settlers or Raiders, they'd have to be in actual communication with both and not be coming to Appalachia for some specific mission - which would be the only reason they would come to Appalachia, being the BoS. The BoS isn't some nation-building dumbass restore civilization faction, they just want to hoard tech so that whoever does restore civilization doesn't do something worse with that tech than the old civilization already did.
---
Sheepsquatch(SS) gave me this message too. I have plenty of TSE weapons but didn't have them out as I was preoccupied with tagging regular mobs. SS spawned and I shot it it twice with tesla and went to switch weapons and it was dead. 
---
I've lost out on SBQ because I'd get a full volley of vats shots off and then it flew out of range. While out of range a few players destroyed her in 10 seconds.
---
Same but I definitely feel there‚Äôs been a couple times where they‚Äôve both been unplayable. *sigh*
---
How r* has fucked a patch up this bad is beyond me
---
I no that exp gain from int. Is 2% per piont and it also caps out at 25 points (50%) and exp cap for kills is 4k and exp cap for events is 6k
---
Heyo, you still on? My GT is Fudgeyplays if you meed to invite or something
---
Thank you!!
---
Out of over 700+ hours of playing, I finally got one out of the machine yesterday. It actually does happen I thought with my jaw at the floor lol.
---
Im just tired of seeing the same effects over and over, and Hence the reason for this discussion.
---
Nocturnal, 50% limb damage, Berserker's, Ghoul Slayers, Exterminator's, etc.
---
Maybe add some Freezing, Incendiary, Plasma Infused, and Wounding. Even if you keep the limit at three stars at least add these new effects to the legendary loot pool.
---
I understand effects that slow time such as Deadeye wont be avalbile as you cant slow time in a live game.
---
I know Incendiary does work because the weapon "Perfect Storm" has it and it works normally.
---
Thanks for the support! Honestly purchasing it is my last resort because I‚Äôm kinda broke rn haha but that‚Äôs a smart fix. Glad you‚Äôre not having issues with it on steam :)
---
I second this. Was about to suggest the same.
---
There are some that are decked out with PVP stats, they're just so damn heavy!  One of my friends was level 40 and got his workshop pushed in by a level 200. Let's just say I watched that level 200 all of assuden get evaporated.
---
I have both a Bloodied Heavy PA Build and a Bloodied Stealth Commando Build w/UNY Armor.  And I have far more fun with the Heavy build than the Commando Build.
---
Tanagra is good place, but you should do it in a public so others will join so you get more enemies. In the tree, every time you mine ultracite ore scorched spawn and there are around 5 to mine and every extra player is 5 extra waves of scorched that will spawn
---
I'm 99.999% sure it was said at con that it will be upgraded for new consoles
---
What did the message say, and where did you see it?
---
Yeah, that is extremely lucky. You will now have the world's worst luck with regards to legendary drops to balance it out.
---
Check around whitspring and Bolton greens you can get 50 to 100 cork (from golfballs) in each run then server hop and repeat
---
As a fellow RDO player, you ever wish you could just squish the best of two games together into one? Like I keep reaching for my eagle eye hotkey to help me find stuff. I also wish there were more pistol options to help scratch that lone wandering gunslinger itch I keep having. 
---
Or improve the gunplay in general really. I really enjoy how in RDO shooting from the hip makes you fan fire your revolvers. The 44 and Single action are so god-awful slow sometimes.
---
There are kids here! It‚Äôs an M rated game with kids playing and probably on this sub too dude, not cool to talk about adult topics on a sub for a mature rated game.
---
It‚Äôs the best when that dice roll comes up pie.
---
Zero. They removed the camp budget requirement a few patches ago.
---
I‚Äôve gotten 8. I hit just about every machine I come across.
---
The hilarious thing is they build a really good ammo converter in The Pitt DLC for fallout 3. Just give us that.
---
I average every 3rd time out of the machine.
---
this glitch has been around so long, and I love it
---
I once had a hot streak and landed it 5 times in 2 weeks. Haven‚Äôt gotten a single one since, well, not from the machine.
---
I'm reasonably sure normal Scorchbeasts, the Sheepsquatch, and the Imposter Sheepsquatch are all the same way, because I've damaged them and avoided getting credit for it.
---
Of course, you could also chalk that up to the server rejecting the damage number that was clearly displayed on my screen.  You can never know the truth.
---
The granary in the middle of nowhere.
---
It has a guaranteed locked container, a regular adventure container that can spawn useful stuff, a number of petrified Scorched, a NW container (chances for all three types), and chance at a Power Armor.
---
It's often in the clear with the first circle, easy to defend by placing the CAMP and building four quick walls at the doors and nobody will bother you because they either have to move on as the circle is closing or will assume it's a trap (and depending on what you get from the containers, it often is). Spawning there undisturbed gives you high chances to survive when you have to leave it.
---
I've repeatedly gotten in the last 10 in many matches thanks to that place, and it was a godsend in unlocking the Ghillie suit.
---
I‚Äôve never bought a shark card and managed to grind my ludicrous empire. And that game has to deal with a lot more than 76. It‚Äôs a business sim, driving sim, flight sim, arcade sim, battle arena sim, boating sim, golf sim, tennis sim,...
---
76 isn‚Äôt half of that and still can‚Äôt deliver.
---
That explains my thoughts exactly when I got it! I still can't believe it
---
how about terminal where you can sell plans one per a time for Bos currency but limited only 5 per day. And that terminal would be terrible non user friendly and for Bos currency you can buy for example plastic toy, small trashcan, and for 1000 of them nice bos themed lamp that will not light. 
---
Thats what we will get when they start thinking about this suggestion.
---
Was one of the best questlines. I wasnt into it at first, but with every new mission I got more invested in the characters, the final "fight" scene was intense even though i knew the outcome.
---
Need at least a cool event to pop up every so often to remind us that they are still technically a faction
---
I actually want a pvp event in relation to factions, they just have to be clever in how they present and execute it. Mechanics and objectives.
---
The main issue is always exploits and right now there are too many.
---
If bos faction ends up being more of the same content idk how I‚Äôll keep an interest in the game unless they extend the map or something
---
If it is green then I assume we made it
---
in all seriousness, if it were me, i'd just ask if i could enter the lobby and take pics with the statues they have there. i've seen them in videos, they're pretty cool.
---
Please no. I'm new to this sort of game haha
---
I'm within 10 minutes of Austin Beth :)
---
Doesn‚Äôt look like it, now on to cork
---
I don't think it's SCORE itself.  It's also that the most recent dupe must have absolutely *saturated* the market, because it feels like there's *always* some joker with a hacked weapon these days.  It has become the exception, rather than the norm, for the SBQ to not instantly die after landing.
---
I don't know if this is just me but it seems that when you scrap modded weapons you have a higher chance to learn a mod.
---
There‚Äôs a body there so you have pass it without realizing it.
---
Bethesda did it cause they want everyone to get the rewards
---
üòÇ
---
Maverick McSticky-Fingers over here makes me look bad. I only have (donated 500) 1700 left
---
Personally I run a minigun bloodied build and it does pretty well against large enemies, then I run a bloodied gatling gun against average and smaller enemies. Tha gat is slow firing and accurate and over all uses very little ammo since it 2 to 3 shot kills nearly any basic enemy. The minigun eats ammo pretty fast, so I save it for enemies that I have difficulty with or alenemies with a large life pool. The issue with bloodied is that it has weaknesses namely damage over time attacks and radiation. If you are looking to kill things fast and don't mind trying to constantly avoid damage, then it can be a good build.
---
Junkies doesn't do quite as much damage but your life bar isnt limited by needing low life as a casualty for damage.
---
Not a Fan of the Order but I like choices and diversity.
---
More Faction should be able to express themself with more Content (Enclave, Responders etc.)
---
We have now some Big Factions in Game to Choose from, now implement the Items and even better Real Player Guilds. Let 10 People get together and remake the Order or Enclave or Brotherhood or Responders let them have some form of Competition with monthly rewards or Titels to earn.
---
We have cool Factions, now implement something to make out of them.
---
I lost the mask so I can't even get inside btw I litterally forgot that the OoM existed.
---
Yeah PvP is a little weird in this game. I wouldn't really attribute that to the non legendary weapon having any special stat though. PvP damage is just counted differently so that a level 50 can't just instantly wreck lower level players. Also the fact that most players run bloodied builds really helps lol.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox we can raise hell in Los Santos together ;)
---
how do i get the ammo converter? i hop on and off of FO76 from time to time and i hopped on last time trying to get it and i thought i did from the season pass
---
True but, personally I can‚Äôt see how RDR was ever gonna be a huge success online. Technology is obviously limited because of the period setting. 
---
Fallout had so much scope to be so great, and still lacks basic updates to make the core services work. I still think 76 has been a steaming pile since it come out. Beth are just lucky they have such loyal fans to the franchise, and lucky that the previous successes made up enough karma that existing fans cut 76 a lot of slack.
---
So, did we make the concrete goal?
---
No. I scrapped mine ages ago by accident. I believe it says it prevents diseases but it doesn‚Äôt in any way shape or form. 
---
I spend every play session riddled with more disease than a college senior and couldn‚Äôt be (snottier) or happier. 
---
#plagueisbest
---
You could hide in the lake even without the card. If you spawn in water, you won't get rads until you leave it and go back in, so if you never leave the water and don't go underwater it's a good spot even without the perk.
---
After it‚Äôs over I think we‚Äôll hear the emergency warning tones, then Rose squawking about how she can‚Äôt believe we fell for it... and something about our entrails...
---
Yes, all the time. Everytime I‚Äôm at my camp in RDO I‚Äôd give anything for it to actually be customizable.
---
they did a year ago and none of you bought the items
---
See if the following works.  
---
Settings -&gt; Volume &amp; Audio Output -&gt; Chat Mixer - Uncheck 'Mute all other sounds'.
---
All the helmet does is prevent airborne disease and look cool. You can use any other mask with the stealth suit and not be set back in any way.
---
I had a similar effect with the radium rifle... 
---
... randomly i had the (known) Plan: Radium Rifle in my inventory, and I started getting non-blanks from making and scrapping them
---
Walk around the same spot in the parking lot, when security asks what you are doing, tell them you are looking for the brown bag that you are positive should be right there.
---
That‚Äôs what a synth would say. 
---
*squints eyes
---
Underwater is part of my strategy.
---
Some high levels with FO1st purposely keep crappy lower level weapons for newer players.
---
Lol, remembering my own college days, that‚Äôs a lot of disease. Thank you for the helpful answer, mate. It‚Äôs what I was hoping to hear. Thanks again and best of luck in the Wasteland!
---
you could photograph Todd, and make documentary about his mystique....
---
"What Mystique?"
---
They already have these but aren‚Äôt for camps I guess
---
Red dead online is different tho  rockstars has focus so much on gta online and ignored the red dead online service even tho it was promoted to be just as good as gta online
---
We could say the same for Zenimax‚Äôs Bethesda fallout76 and elder scrolls online are just the same but they were developed by 2 different studio unlike gta online and RDR online
---
Not all are learned from breaking down weapons. Some you have to buy the plans or you get from events or quest rewards
---
Same to you my friend and all the best.
---
Perfect! Thank you very much for the response. Stealth Raider go!
---
This is how INT works for xp...
---
Final XP = Base XP x( 1 + 0.03xINT )

---
Walk around in tightly wighties, when they tell you to put some clothes on tell them they are mistaken and you are dawning a full set of T-65 power armor.
---
There are many idiots but sometimes people use the calling emote for legendaries. Me? I don't care about uber builds or meta so I play what is fun for me. I never one shot anything, usually use a weaker weapon with explosives to tag and get most of the xp. Even with my 2h melee.
---
what planet
---
"Seeing as we didnt get the concrete done..."
---
Say what now?
---
I agree but it‚Äôs almost like they didn‚Äôt even try. Businesses and property were supposed to be large parts of the appeal and they‚Äôve never attempted it.
---
There‚Äôs plenty of ways they could have gone with flying machines, etc. or even just throw us Undead Nightmare and build off that. RDO just feels like they never bothered, it‚Äôs always just going to be GTAs weird little brother.
---
Sadly the gatling gun seems semi rare compared to the 50 cal or minigun so I don't find as many. I did buy one from a player vendor and broke it down and also got a blank learned. I assume it's trying to learn it but not.
---
You might have to put a second foundation next to it so you can orient the door how you want it.
---
This would be amazing.
---
How is Todd going to make us give up all our concrete for them though?
---
The concrete is completed
---
GTA Online at least gets constant attention from rockstar unlike RDO.
---
Considering that the loot pool included most plans in the game that weren't faction or quest specific, it would be hard not to. 
---
Without adding a ton of new items into the game for free, which is not going to happen outside another score battle pass, there is a limitation on what else can be added to the loot pool. 
---
What you're facing is the end game so "loot" isn't going to ever be something useful to most level 100+ players.
---
This is the only community I know of when playing online where almost all of the blame is being put on the people doing the exploits. Sure they shouldn‚Äôt be but I barely blame them at this point when Bethesda hasn‚Äôt even lifted a finger....how is this not a bigger issue! It is single handedly the two biggest exploits but we got people complaining about events and killing legendaries, atomic shop, camp issues and loot etc. Who cares about any of that when someone can come along after playing less than a few days worth and doing better in end game activities one shooting anything in their way without dying while other people who have maximized their builds for 100s of hours can‚Äôt even do that. Sure maybe red dead has bugs but atleast it doesn‚Äôt have god mode and instant shot weapons for 2 years!
---
Just wanted to point it out for people who didn't know it, or doesn't have three points in Endurance.
---
Besides, I've never been shot hiding there with my head over the water, so it doesn't really make much difference imo.  Even if someone sees you, it's not worth the risk.
---
Clancy manor has a ton of crystal decanters
---
If they aren't using Dense / Fire Proof, are they really your friends? ;)
---
Start working up your run speed now. You still have a few months.
---
Whatchu talkin bout Willis?
---
Honestly it was one of the best holy sh!t moments when the lair reveals itself.
---
I‚Äôm going to take a LONG break when I hit 100. Maybe a few months. Rank wise, I‚Äôm about the same place as you right now.
---
Same here. Hit 86 today. After Tuesday‚Äôs weeklies, I‚Äôm buying the rest.
---
Time for a break.
---
Good sir, I believe you forgot something
---
**NO ONE OUTRUNS THE ASSAULTRON**
---
And that was my number one complaint about taking fallout online. The game is great in it‚Äôs own way but will we ever have an epic story driven fallout again?
---
Well what would their purpose be? The fact that they are still down there guarding the gold is incredible in a way. Its just 5 guys that seemingly have nothing else to do... (If they where connected to the Enclave we could be cooking with gas...)
---
Me too. I usually just equip Glow Sighted when running Whitespring during a nuke for all the glowing ghouls.
---
Absolutely! Free States are my people! &lt;3
---
I don't believe that we as a community are even donating what Bethesda says we are donating.  I know I have donated anything and I haven't even gone to the camp.  Why?  Because I don't want the crap rewards.  They're basically having us donate for something that was already planned to be released......stupid and something quick they could do to make it seem like they are involved in this game that they probably don't play.
---
IMO, it's stupid to make a "goal" when there is no way people will donate 150 MILLION steel and etc.
---
Not everyone has Fallout 1st so making a "event" like this where we have to donate our material for crap rewards is very stupid.
---
  Its easier to get the pie from the machine than it is to get BoS paints 3-6 from Forbidden Knowledge.
---
The systems don‚Äôt automatically upgrade the games. That‚Äôs why I asked if this particular game is getting upgraded for the new generation in this games forum
---
I've had good luck running 5 pieces of troubleshooters armor with a dense mod on the chest.
---
I also run as many levels of chem fiend, field surgeon, team medic, and first aid as my build will allow.  I also like to use blocker to reduce melee damage if she arggos on you.  I also leave serendipity, nerd rage, and dodgy on for emergencies.  
---
I also prefer superstims over the regular.  We usually do 3 queen runs before encrypted and thats usually enough to get me through the event.  After a few events you kinda get the hang of when/how often to pop the stims.
---
Between the cards and armor I can tank all 3 pylons and get my hits in.  I've used the same build for both heavy gunner and commando builds.  Trying to stay in stealth with my commando also works well.
---
Very helpful. Did not know there were any crates in the fire.
---
Instead of being fun, it's actually taking away the fun of the game. Specially with the increased score requirements to lvl up.
---
If another NPC or item is at the spawn location it can mess it up, but where you place your physical CAMP device within the CAMP bounds absolutely will always change where your spawn in is. 
---
If you're noticing a problem maybe pick up and redrop your CAMP unit in build mode.
---
Radium is a Special case, for reasons only know the Bethesda it has the armour learn rate not the weapon.
---
Eventually the shrinking circle forces me to make my way towards the middle of the map. Aquaboy can get you a long way into a match.
---
Tbh they quickly learnt this and now do it lol , I use these too because my own weapons have a tendency to try to kill me, I mostly use explosive prefix weapons
---
why not consider a rework of existing effects to give them some purpose instead of adding even more loot variety which leads to even more legendary trash.
---
I use a different helmet... ranger helmet. I didn't like the orangey, insect look. Reminds me of a mantis
---
Nah, Intelligence only gives you more materials back when Scrapping.
---
I'd honestly wait till one wasteland comes out in September,
---
TIL. This should be something that is put in a tool tip or something.
---
And all Bethesda hears is "please let the holiday gifts  have the same loot pool as last year"
---
And maybe let us keep the reload speed increase when used with the Trail firework mines! Makes the single action so much more fun to use!
---
I apologize I went to fallout.com and saw it had moved on to cork but down at the bottom it shows the banner as "locked"
---
When looking up to find answers I kept finding posts about people learning it in only a few breakdowns so I assume it's learnable. I haven't had luck finding it via vendors yet, wiki says only watoga shopping plaza or whitesprings bunker.
---
I stopped playing alts pretty much all together. Currently 97 and once I get 100 my alts will come out to play again.
---
hello i play Red Dead Online and i can confirm that the game is abysmal. i only play it as i like it more than GTA Online (less griefers and such) but the grind is absolute shite. the game was never gonna be as successful as GTAO, but the state that it‚Äôs in is terrible. also, the last patch literally broke the game so that‚Äôs fun...
---
I agree, I started playing it again after the new role was introduced and I can barley play for more than 5 minutes before it disconnects, last night my horse kept disappearing from under me, its a real big mess.
---
The one in the store isn't the Survival Tent. It's just decoration. If you didn't place a camp yet, you won't have the option for a survival tent (at least I don't think so). But the option should show up when you pull up your favorites wheel. Same as setting up a C.A.M.P.
---
Perhaps you could craft one, mod and then scrap it?

It‚Äôs probably not even worth it to think this, but my dream story for the Brotherhood‚Äôs return is that they show up, shit on Russell who somehow connects with the Free States who also come back to Appalachia, flip some of the Brotherhood and we have to decide between the factions.
---
Yes it does. Sony specifically said that it is up to the individual publisher to provide free upgrades or not. Showing Sony fully supports free upgrades.
---
By far the best storyline !!!!!!!
---
I just don't understand the value proposition with the Gauss stuff.
---
Yes, it hits like a truck.  If you charge it.  In that time, you could have fired off a more conventional weapon 2-3 times, and not only would that too hit like a truck, but A: there's a greater chance at least one of these shots will connect and not be conveniently rejected by the server and B: you're unlikely to get swarmed because you can fire a lot faster.
---
I have a Bloodied Gauss Shotgun on my Shotgunner and while its damage in the thousands is appealing, it's so ridiculously quirky and sluggish to get that charge that my Bloodied Combat Shotgun is the thing I'll take every time.
---
Mileage will vary. Still some considerate players in the wasteland. It‚Äôs a flawed tagging system, but we work with what we have.
---
I made this awhile back. Just gunna drop it in their parking area.

---
The Order of Mysteries doesn't advertise their presence. They are everywhere and no where. Let the Brotherhood take there very public, and exposed position. The Order will silently endure while every raider and monster in Appalachia guns for them.
---
gatling gun mod learning is broken right now.  I've had all of the mods learned for over a year, but every gatling gun I scrap now says that i learned blank.  your best bet is to buy a speedy receiver mod box from watoga / harpers ferry  or whatever train vendor sells it and just install.
---
Yea I‚Äôm ganna slow down too  I‚Äôm just ganna focus on weekly  only.. and take the daily as they come 
---
But in the end of the season if I like the rewards I‚Äôll just buy the rank up
---
Thumbs up for irony
---
They already belong to a faction - the Enclave.
---
They might just not know it yet.
---
I dont think you undetstood what I meant either.
---
OP spoke about People coming to ruin the fun of more causal players abusing OP weapons, not about the OP weapons to be a problem.
---
If you use an OP weapon in Skyrim, its just your problem and doesnt affect everyone else gaming exp√©rience. In the SQB fight, it does, fun wise and loot wise. So yeah, thats why you can¬¥t compare
---
Same thing happens with all other workstations or animation objects (bed, chair, instrument, etc) if the CAMP or tent is removed while player is in the animation. 
---
Only fix is getting into a PA or another forced animation by interaction with another object. 
---
Otherwise you're floating around playing air guitar around the wasteland.
---
I would like it if you could help them either join or take over the white springs bunker and unlock more areas in the resort like a player‚Äôs personal room in one of the side houses and they could add a daily of getting rid of some of the ghouls
---
Honestly, why would they care? Meg‚Äôs raiders are a rival armed group and Foundation is just some civilians. They wouldn‚Äôt get along any better with either group just like they didn‚Äôt get along with the other raiders or the Responders and for pretty much the same reasons.
---
46k....holy shit dude....and here i was feeling accomplished after i scrounged to get 500 and donated... : /
---
Dang it, on PC with GTA. I actually had my PC built for it. I was originally going to buy a 2nd 76 to go on it too, but burnt out on 76 before I could convince myself. I had already done it with 3, NV, and 4, so when they announced Fallout 1st I thought it would be something good like Minecraft realms where I pay and could convince my friends to play again and I would pick up another copy.
---
Then they released 1st and I realized that wasn‚Äôt going to happen.
---
I loved Jakobs weapons in BL2
---
Classic Sully.
---
Auto gauss rifle?
---
Must be a synth.
---
Bloodied magical heavy PA with emergency protocols.
---
Last time, I just grabbed a m79 for multiple tags. No need burning up my valuable ammo.
---
That would be wonderful.
---
I think they broke it two patches ago (Patch 20 I think?)
---
Swing speed is the best!!!! Nice!
---
Yep totaly right
---
An  I should add You become enclave general (Major enemy of BOS at that time)  to trick to an AI (modus)  for its help to get tho silos. Not because you are aware of what enclave and its true motives was before you emerge from vault. 
---
Vault 76 came without npcs an that was a short sighted design. Then they added npcs and this move  created some  inconsistency in game.
---
And it's at 200 million. Now who down voted me?
---
Me too, I expect to have a couple of weeks to shake off the grind.
---
The reload on that gun is such a slap in the face to my gunslinger-wannabe ass.
---
The holiday gifts should expire after a certain time.
---
Yeah I've been hopping around for a bit now looking to just buy the mod. Got a decent enough legendary roll I don't think I'll be replacing for a while. Shame I wasted so many screws making guns lol
---
Agreed, my favorite story in the vanilla game üëç
---
I mean, it‚Äôs pretty clear that FO76 is an offshoot. I‚Äôd imagine that given all the previous Fallouts are story driven that FO5 will follow down the same path. 
---
FO76 just exists to capitalize on the live service model that can indefinitely support players and keep them spending and invested in the brand until FO5 can be released in the next generation of consoles.
---
A lack of new Free States and Responders content is a very sad missed opportunity that I hope they will dive into more with development. 
---
Personally, especially after FO4, I am unable to not hate the BoS. So the rest of the year has little to offer me if it's all grinds to unlock rank or cosmetics for them.
---
It happened to me. So lel.
---
Yes, it would be.
---
‚ÄòMarine Armor is utter garbage you shouldn‚Äôt use unless you hate yourself due to its weight and protection surprisingly lower than Heavy Combat Armor (BoS).‚Äô
---
They should work on the mechanics of a lot of different weapons. I wanna do cool shit with a sword you know? Or take out three ghouls with a sledgehammer.. fan fire would be fucking sick aha
---
Is it a random encounter?  Lately, I‚Äôve only been able to find an encounter with a mamma sloth and her babies versus some Yao.   That wouldn‚Äôt constitute as tameable
---
Also separate serums from aid.
---
And he was like wait why do I still have hard bargain equipped? Shit. No wonder those robots seemed hard.
---
The single action should be the most powerful or the fastest firing to make up for the reload. It needs something to make it viable
---
I paid for a handfulof levels last night.   I was just so sick of not playing the game "my" way that I couldn't take it any longer. And I absolutely,  positively HAD to get that secret door fireplace before I gave up....
---
I realize that there was still plenty of time left that I may very well have gotten there anyway, but until this Legendary Race event,  I had paid a grand total of zero attention to the dailies,  and I have found that I vastly prefer that mode of play.
---
As was mentioned elsewhere, between this grind and the reputation/ bullion grind,  I wasn't even playing "my" game any longer.   It had become a real chore, and I felt immediate liberation from that chore and instead I spent that time doing what brings me the most satisfaction in the game - tweaking my C.A.M.P.  It really is an insanely therapeutic exercise for me.
---
They really REALLY should nail this one though....if they do it might even bring in some of the fresh blood this game needs. Im excited too but cautious cuz u know....
---
I'm honestly surprised they haven't taken measures to get them out of the game.
---
Don't hype too much.
---
As an MMORPG player  it a super positive thing
---
Do you have a bathtub in your dirty camp?
---
Thought so ü•≥
---
I haven‚Äôt actually checked, but it feels like the reload for it in 76 is slower than it was in New Vegas.
---
No bashing? Not even Dumbledore brand boomsticks?
---
Serums are in Misc
---
same boat. i saw  that old guides for the quest mentioned a mole rat and wolf sample also. maybe they messed something up when they shortened the number of objectives? i might go find a wolf and rat and see if that works.
---
&gt; That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre referring to.
---
Are you OP?
---
Because the updates themselves are not that big either. It's, on PS4 where the SONY-updater requires the big download. On PC you might get the 60-70 GB displayed as patch size, yet the actual downloaded size was seldom over 7-8GB. Again, nothing big.
---
I didn't know about holding the back button to exit the interface, which is awesome, but I found that you can save a lot of time and frustration if you hit back on the screen after buying/selling the ammo you don't get buried so deep in menus and you don't have to click through all the additional menus to get to the buy/sell screen.
---
...and 100 mounted plans.
---
Serums are in misc
---
Just take them all to get the quest rewards, build concrete and power and then server hop.
---
This was all built post-Patch 21, so I‚Äôm sure you can knock your build out of the park :)
---
I've gotten it from a machine exactly once in the 1656 hours I have played 76. 
---
Weirdly enough, I found one in the collection bin of a port-a-diner once too.
---
Even less sense but TIL.
---
Where the Free States Love? Y'know.. the ones who set up the scorched detection system.. the ones who knew the Government was up to no good... they Made their own bunkers...
---
Honestly, if you‚Äôre a sniper and have your agility high enough, you really don‚Äôt even need the CSA. But the nostalgia of it is nice for sure.
---
The most disappointing thing about Fo76 was that nothing has been improved on in terms of gunplay and melee fighting since Oblivion. There's just no flair to any of it. Swing swing swing.
---
Still enjoying the game, but yeah, hard agree.
---
I think they should be removed completely from game and replaced with gold&gt;plan machine because they served their purpose in story, but that's me.
---
People tend to leave the world if they‚Äôre at max caps
---
I have a machine I keep stocked with nuka-cola items
---
RIP guess we didnt; now on Cork and the flag still says locked  
---
oh well; i guess well see it and the rest of the inevitably failed items in a 4,000 atom BoS "pack"
---
Im for it, but it needs to work in vats aswell.
---
Lol you‚Äôre responding to the wrong person then. Reread through this thread. The discussion was about the flying mechanic, the OP made a passing comment about magic weapons which was a small part that we weren‚Äôt discussing. The first post on this thread is clearly about flying mechanics and how the SBQ is not balanced properly to be a fun fight.
---
Just had the vault raid from hell. 3 glitches and 2 bsod. Frankly sick of meeting the gang.
---
I think RDO had some sort of single player campaign, not sure if it was any good...
---
Yea I'm confused what message pops up?
---
I really think someone at Bethesda has some kind of decimal point dyslexia. So many alterations and "bugs" all based around adding or removing some zeros. ;P
---
They may tap into fo3 locations and hint to Boston but they're incredibly unlikely to do much more other than acknowledge Vegas and California exist.
---
People should just stop putting these by the hundreds in their vendor... But that's like asking a trump fan to wear a mask ü§£
---
You know they mention a few weeks ago that they going to remove thirst and hunger effects from the game because it an inconvenience as the game isn‚Äôt about survival anymore....
---
Well it also an inconvenience to farm bullets too
---
Yup. Once I see that my caps suddenly hit 30k, I alt+f4, relaunch, go on a privet server, and spend that money at Whitespring.
---
Only in the box at the back exit or is there more?
---
Ok this is not going well. I will not participate in this comparison battle.
---
Finally a sorry emote!
---
I've been crashing randomly after fast traveling since patch 21.
---
‚ÄúSo sorry‚Äù emote is definitely going to be used sarcastically lmao
---
Exactly they don‚Äôt do them automatically. It is up to the different studios putting out the games. That‚Äôs why I asked in this forum. Do you understand yet?
---
Simmer down those hopes there, lad. We have yet to get an update or feature that actually lived up to expectations
---
Because they're boring. Just my opinion.
---
Fissure = instant death
---
I just came to shout about this! I‚Äôve been wanting it so long! //also huge thanks for posting this
---
He was asking about other players exp√©rience and talked about its frustration because of ither players behavior...
---
Automatic or not the updates will be the same.
---
I looked too but it seems the page didn't update for me
---
Fancy Thanksgiving Display is back for yall
---
Oh i know, but i started getting the :
---
"Plan Learned...." blank nonsense
---
then, when I had the known plan in my inventory, I started getting the actual plans from scrapping
---
[edit: about 20-30 scraps per new mod learned]
---
I never DC in RDO.
---
If it were me, when this pandemic is over, I'd totally call and ask if they do tours.
---
Keep in mind, though, Fallout 76 isn't made there.  It's primarily Austin, TX with assistance from Dallas.  Bethesda "Prime" works on Starfiend and TES6.
---
Exactly. I would do a rep route everyday and hit 7-10 locations. Usually got a rep encounter on about half of those locations on any day. It‚Äôs a sliver of rep but all those slivers add up.
---
"Hey kid wanna earn some BoS bux?  Well I dropped my technical data at LOCATION can you go pick it up for me?"    
---
That's as deep as the story will go.
---
Worst is when the camp is high. I'm 90% sure someone tried to grief me the other day, camp hanging out high by the bridge, went to their vendor and had a load of junkies weapons for cheap that I snapped up. After I shopped they lured me over with a dropped bag and the follow emote. As I was heading over they must have logged out, camp disappeared and dropped me - but I was wearing power armor so didn't die. They had a friend waiting at the bottom there who looked really awkward. I did the confused emote and moved on with my sweet collection of junkies.
---
I have no idea why I shared this story, it was really odd, only thing I could think of was they were trying to help their friend get the revive challenge for tadpole quest, who knows.
---
Here's the easiest fix to trap camps and the obly fair one. If your camp hurts me, I should be able to hurt it. Trapped in a room with flamethrower? I should be able to shoot my way out, or destroy the flamethrowers.
---
Capture last few minutes on xbox and follow them to new server
---
The Fancy Display Case is back!!!
---
Yes pistol, shotgun and HeavyGun were the only ranged weapons limiting other builds. Secret service armor is nice but brotherhood hopefully brings more to the gold grind and perhaps a new heist would be cool.
---
On launch I played daily till I reached 100, after that I stopped playing for almost two years and am only now getting back in to the game. It is natural to get burned out.
---
Free Sponders are on the come up
---
hrhr, maybe you should try playing a stealth sniper in the nuke zone.
---
Your opinion will surely change. It is a must have as it brings nearly the same rad resistance as a PA. And since sneak in groups is still fubar, it's a must have.
---
starched genes in the luck special tree negates that , you unlock it early on
---
rank it up to rank 2 youll never lose a mutation
---
Check if someone has placed a tent to break line in the sand, nuke the area, and wait for the event to start. Other players will be there sure but if you have a full team and you have decently fast (preferably explosive) weapons, you will get more than enough.
---
like others have mentioned, there are mods for 3, NV, 4 and even Skyrim with far more content and work put into it.
---
Project Brazil comes to mind.
---
but even then, Fo76 is comparable to a single Fo4 DLC and that's not a good thing.
---
Long needed
---
Well, if a faction throws around nuclear weapons willy-nilly just to do what is basically fancy gardening, they may choose to try a polite chat first.
---
Nothing for fallout 1st?
---
Someone did that last night, I didn't buy anything but they waited until I had seen all the machines, waved, and disappeared. Customer service to the last.
---
I feel like someone should start a thank-you sticky thread with names.
---
Most likely! just wish I‚Äôd had a chance to purchase the goods ü•∫
---
I would like to get back to just exploring and doing events . Lvl 180
---
thanks for your mercy üôèüèΩ
---
easier to find ammo. damage drops a bit.
---
if you had your pa on then if they did try to grief you they must be really stupid xD
---
Does the new So Sorry emote have it's own character model animation or does the player just do some generic animation while the cartoon emote plays?
---
All the people burnt out buying the last few levels just so they can stop.  It's almost as if the system was designed with this exact result in mind...
---
Do you already have an Ally? You can only have 1 at your camp at a time.
---
Yeah but then they‚Äôd miss those caps so :/
---
That‚Äôs good of them! Never know when a visitor might buy one of your pricey weapons!
---
We have to wait for some one with it to post
---
Agreed, but at the very least they've gotten Atom Shop items to represent your allegiance.
---
[Ahem..spin cocking lever guns plz.](https://youtu.be/E8OsYE8kiqg)
---
Fair warning about the Raider Waster PA paint.. It's bugged with Pipe Weapons and with certain heavy guns the left arm will obstruct most of your screen .
---
Edit: It works fine for the Laser and Plasma Gatlings though.
---
GT is ButtMudMike I'm getting on in a few min.
---
What‚Äôs in the Nuka-Cola bundle?
---
Yeah I leave server and move caps with my friend or buy something
---
Did you build his comfy chair in the companions build menu?
---
I am a stealth sniper. The CSA has greater rad resistance than power armor. I do use it, but only for high rad areas.
---
different strokes
---
I do! I wasn‚Äôt aware that you could have an ally other than Becket or the space gal. I‚Äôll try removing her terminal and see if he shows up.
---
HELP ME!!  I'M A CHEATER AND I DON'T WANT TO PAY THE CONSEQUENCES
---
I don't mind running around the map farming materials to make ammo and repair weapons and armor. The main complaint is the conversion rate of the ammo converter.
---
If ur running a heavy build glow sight and concentrated fire are great to have. Bloody mess is just awesome and has a place for any build. I think rejuvenated in end gets over looked alot. And dodgey+actionboy+lone wanderer is a great combo for most builds as well.
---
Is that the Fallout 1st helmet? I have the same one. I was also wearing that for a while, it‚Äôs very cool for sure. But I‚Äôm loving the Raider Skull Gas Mask I‚Äôve just unlocked in the legendary run tree.
---
‚úäüèº Very True! In the Name of Raleigh Clay
---
They could have been farming legendary ghouls.
---
That may be a rude move, but the nukes were made for destruction and madness. If anything, you're just doing what the game wants you to do.
---
I‚Äôll try that, I wasn‚Äôt aware that there were allies other than Becket or the space gal. Thanks, I didn‚Äôt think to check there!
---
And the regular stainless fridge, which is also nice.  Will have to pick up both.
---
Yes, now when i accidentally kill an legendary with splash damage because i didn't see it, i can apologize.
---
What about the petrified scorched?
---
Yes it was 100% intentional, whole camp felt fishy like it was set up to drop people from height. Even had one of them signs on the way in that say "have a nice day" but they'd changed "nice" to "shit". If you're on Reddit you're an idiot, but it was slightly amusing.
---
I've seen people use it just for XP farming the easy ghoul gauntlet
---
Happened to me after finishing Encrypted, died to the explosion, and couldn't respawn.
---
Had to ALT+F4
---
can confirm, 1 cork with scrapper, slightly more than no cork
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the appeal of the stealth suit to me (in addition to nostalgia). The fact it‚Äôs completely end game viable.
---
is your xbox old (3+ years?) check out cache rebuilding and memory organizing (may have to delete ye olde things to make room)
---
Hahaha what?? No it isn't.  That's an absolutely ludicrous claim.
---
Reasonably impressed by them actually taking steps to reverse thier ineptitude for once.    
---
That's the bare minimum we should expect, not something deserving of a kudos.  üòü
---
Same as last week.
---
I feel your pain. I once too stumbled upon a camp with lots of stuff for quite cheap and the owner suddenly left leaving me to plop on the ground like a sack of potatoes xD But I managed to buy a bit. My theory is that they either at max caps and had to leave or just didn't notice me at camp. if the camp is not high in the mountains that makes it easy for griefing then it's most likely that.
---
Hello! I'm a Megasloth tamer (I've had more than 5 sloths in my Fallout 76 time lol) 
---
Let me clarify yall, Megasloths only appear in The Mire and Cranberry Bog (Part of it) 
---
It has to be a random encounter (Mamma Sloth can't be tamed), Megasloth in trees can't be tamed.
---
Hulking Megasloth level 40 can't be tamed.
---
The only Megasloths tamable are the Sluggish Megasloth level 20 and the Scorched Megasloth (Both of them as random encounter) 
---
I recommend to stay with the Sluggish Megasloth, Scorched Megasloth tends to attack your crops endessly
---
I actually don't mind the Hunger and thirst aspect of the game.
---
It comes off as "I'm better than you because I know these plans and you're trying to sell them, how dare you" sometimes. Thankfully,  this sub is really tiny compared to the full fanbase. Sell what you want. Do what you want. I've sold these plans for 150 caps before. The markets there.
---
All of my this
---
That Eagle Nest is legit!
---
Mama fucking Mia the thanksgiving display case is finally back
---
Question from a newbie- are the discount amounts always the same? (eg bundles always 30%)? Or will the items there be at different discounts at some other point in the year? eg a Christmas everything half price or whatever.
---
Make sure to build him a TV in front of his chair, too. Gramps deserves only the best, since he IS the best.
---
In NW they give guaranteed loot if you activate them before they crumble. Not much, but you have a shot at useful chems or CAMP pieces.
---
He does a gesture that doesn't really speak I'm sorry. More like "whoops"
---
Right on man.  Yeah there are two others you have to meet in the world as random encounters then build their item.
---
Wut?! You can get 4k cap on a kill?
---
Think of it as selling ammo and buying ammo with a special currency..
---
Somebody is going to figure out the same ammo to sell for the most points (currency) to rebuy the useful ammo
---
It was in last week as well - specifics can be found on last weeks post - https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3ptn3/august_4th_atom_shop_update_for_those_on_the/
---
I cant get anywhere near that event.. just lags tf out for me
---
feels like I get about 10fps.. lol
---
Just need a laughing emote now to laugh at the griefers.
---
Or go dual pistols. Pistols are just so meh...if i could equip 2 different pistols tho.....mmmmmmm
---
tinkerbell is gonna live whether you clap or not, don't worry it's gonna be fine
---
How many atoms?
---
Works for me, thanks for the info!
---
even better
---
I believe it was 1/10th the man hours, which is still ridiculous.
---
Cool! Do they have questlines too?
---
Anywhere but the middle.
---
Got the valentine's bed and rug already. Theyre August's items.
---
YES I want this so bad. And a Silver Shroud style thing too.
---
I love it haha
---
Definitely, I really liked the arktos fridge but everytime I go to someone's camp and they have the textures on it never load.
---
I could be imagining this but i think they said they were working on it.
---
I bet they'd do Point Lookout again instead of Far Harbor because it's closer and fits the Interloper stuff they have in the game. They even hinted at doing more with the weird creature, so it would make sense to me.
---
I literally bought rdr2 2 days ago to take a break from fo76... and welp I'm back. üòÇüòÇ
---
You reminded me, I have to go back to the enclave bunker and re-read all the terminals. I did not realize until recently that logs were unlocked after completing the quest line. I would have preferred to know the enclave story the usual way but heh.
---
Im only thinking about buying it for that gold plated .50 cal skin.
---
Just weep for your depleted screws.... :|
---
Holy sh**!!! I never noticed that!!! Thank you.
---
My buddy was using the skin last night and his headlamp was also rotated 90 degrees to the right so it wasn‚Äôt lighting anything up in front of him.
---
Woah, hate those people.. I once had a camp set in the mountains too that was right above the abyss but it was because I liked it. I spent quite some time figuring out how put camp module so people wouldn't kill themselves when teleporting to me.
---
I don't try that often, because i'd just hoard it in my stash forever, but there was a time i got two in a row from the same machine. It seems the one in the Rusty Pick is relatively generous with the pie. Still not easy to get, though.
---
When i get back from the mire hunting wendigos I'll persuade him with my gauss pistol to leave the aria
---
What platform are you on? I can mod it for you if you are on PC.
---
210!
---
Yikes we already launched. Sorry my dude. Could help with the crimson nuke in a few hours?
---
It was so lame that they just cut out a huge chunk of builds.  As a rifle sniper, I was like, oh thanks, guess I got Gauss guns already, swell.
---
Is there a bonus item in the eagle bundle?
---
210 I believe!
---
No he said the EXP Cap (aka max) is 4k per kill
---
Actually, getting one pie from the claw machine it depends on your Luck stats. Having higher Luck stats will make it easier
---
You grind concrete for eternity.
---
Oh no all the B2525 fixers will be no good!  If you don‚Äôt have a B25252525 your not a cool kid lol
---
"Chally is a moo moo, but not Your moo moo"
---
I'm sorry but that makes no sense, unless there's been a change I haven't noticed all legendary drops from RR are locked to level 40 with the majority of drops at level 35, making them useless for anything but scrip.
---
I try, sometimes I set my girl down to play some tunes while I get ready for bed but some of y'all are literally afk for 20 minutes at my camp and I'm falling asleep with the controller in my hand waiting for you to finish what you're doing. 
---
It'd be nice if we could set up a 5 minute sign-out timer to warn players the user is wanting to hop off.
---
It‚Äôs a slow grind either way; there must be something that needs your attention after or before you finish these dailies
---
I‚Äôve read that since the update this hasn‚Äôt been working out.  I myself have never tried it though so I don‚Äôt know firsthand.
---
There are glitches to get to ally on Raider faster
---
your titles are the best part of tuesdays
---
and look at all of the stuff that if I buy, I cant fit into my camp due to budget!
---
Yup and put the angry emote in the blood eagle bundle. Only way to grt that emote....
---
Up next, "Not Sorry" :-)
---
Ah, thanks lol.
---
You craft new ones at a higher level but they require your original outfit as a crafting ingredient
---
thanx
---
Happened to me and a friend to. If you start pvp with them and they attempt shooting they will get out of it just a FYI
---
I am also on PC, just working right now but I could try and pop on later today
---
If I see a CAMP that is suspended in the air, I don't shop there, because I don't trust them to stay on the server and keep me from falling.
---
For real??? wtf...
---
edit: they don't show up in the fallout 1st tab so I doubt that.
---
God dammit, I need the doctor outfit but I was saving my atoms incase I have to get ahead of zorbo in the legendary run
---
Frederick is still out there I assume and hopefully some recruits too
---
Only way to get the icon too right? Pretty annoying
---
I never found cranberry or anything beside original, cherry, and quantum
---
I would like to see a resource collection event to rebuild the mansion and begin a new quest chain. Maybe allow you to officially register as a mistress (not unknown user as it currently stands) and compete on a leaderboard taking out blood eagles and other wasteland threats, along with helping civilians and solving mysteries (daily). Now THAT would be awesome. You could get the OoM wall emblem as a reward along with other cosmetics. And at the end the order hall would be rebuilt and we would have more order related content.
---
patience. you'll get the rest.
---
Stay excited but... I implore you not to get your hopes too high, knowing thier current track record.
---
one direction ruins lives
---
You don't want to piss off our God Todd.
---
I guess them numbers we see on the page do actually mean something after all...
---
The better argument would be to put something in that shows a brief breakdown of what is in the vendor. Like something to indicate if there‚Äôs legendaries or maybe the avg cap value of the items
---
I buy non legendary gear to disassemble and learn their plans. You aren't the target audience lol
---
I agree, excited for new content but it will probably be a small map with lots of restrictions.
---
What if I already whipped mine out
---
As someone who went through the trouble of completing a magazine collection I know exactly the kind of pain you must be going through. That really sucks, it's not a quick process even with player vendors. Good luck starting a new one.
---
The only redeeming quality of RDR2 is that unlike 76, it has its off-line single player story mode that adds value to the purchase. RDO is crap!
---
Suckers. I'd have paid 1200 for it üòÇüòÇ can't wait to add this to my camp
---
It was more a Fallout 1st "Discount" more than a 1st Item.
---
I did same thing I had atoms saved up and nothing to buy being I‚Äôm a fallout first member. So I could‚Äôve grinded for it but I said screw it and bought them. Still have plenty of atoms left over and I got a lot of down votes for saying I bought it. But I‚Äôm 33 I got kids and a family and am working this whole time. I work 60+ hours so I didn‚Äôt wanna keep having to play 4 to 5 hours after everyone went to bed.
---
See the description. But does not include it.
---
&gt;This was quite possibly the best questline in the vanilla game
---
while the climax disappointed me a little due to execution, i still wholeheartedly agree. it was one of the Vanilla quests that I truly enjoyed and that i continue to recommend to new players.
---
that said, they are just going to let it rot. there is so much potential to do things with original characters, factions, and storylines, but things like that get inevitably sidelined by BoS content.
---
It's worth it!
---
Which part?
---
No point doing it now if they havent before
---
Same, and I do my best lol.
---
For me, it would be the latter - I try to remember to check, but sometimes I forget.  I know I've accidentally dumped a few people that way.
---
NUKE. Line of Sand. You‚Äôre welcome
---
Shows how much I pay attention week to week. Thanks.
---
They are messing me up by changing the bundle names.
---
I just want Abandoned Bog Town and the SBQ kill to finally register for me.
---
This works for all terminals, no matter how many menus deep you are. It can be a lifesaver if something attacks you while you are reading a terminal.
---
Funniest thing is someone rushes out and obliterates Nightstalker in 0,0000000000012ms, like his/her life depends on it, while couple of us are still finishing the animation of leaving instruments.
---
This event is both fun ( playing instruments while carnage happens ) and horrible in terms of rewards for those that actualy play instruments. I can 1 shot anything in the event, but still rather hug the bass and enjoy the rythm than racing other (too)op builds getting kills in the event.
---
same
---
I got your back on that. Death to those authoritarian jocks.
---
Were badges actually dropping because I was doing about 30 repeatable dailies with only 4 badges to show for it.  I eventually gave up and bought the plan off someone.
---
I just checked, it‚Äôs 500 atoms.
---
I've been wanting that display case for so long looks like I'm buying $10 worth of atoms today.
---
Na bud the mag where copies for a friend if he wanted to start I still have my full set thx, God
---
If you sell 1000 rounds of 5mm to the machine you get 700 ammo point. In turn if you buy 1000 rounds of 5mm it cost 3000 ammo points.  It's 4 to 1 exchange rate for ammo.
---
Yes ! I want a dlc to revive the Order. Recruit others to become the new hierarchy, get new missions etc.
---
Every night I login, it‚Äôs super laggy and last night it kicked me out.  And my connection is very good.
---
how could you compare thise games? yes rdr2 is unplayeble right now, but im sure cockstar will fixed it pretty soon.... not like bethesda. Beth will NEVER fix f76
---
Saw that! Pretty righteous.
---
If you work as a tech project manager, surely you have some idea of how odd and demoralizing it is for people to remain so vocally obsessed with shooting down this team of planners and devs? They read this stuff. I would, if I were them. Give your feedback and lay off, man!
---
Yes. Holding ‚Äúback‚Äù will exit any terminal, not just this one.
---
That gave me a good laugh!
---
They still sell for me when I post them
---
When I steal I level 60s workshop after he stole it from a level 5 I‚Äôll use it
---
Wait go on about mayor for a day. What big thing happens
---
Isn't the enclave ending the "real" ending? It's the only faction the dweller really joins and sides with(story wise). Besides, the only reason the MODUS enclave was bad was because of Thomas McEdgeart(Glad he got killed). MODUS even hints that "his?" enclave will possibly never restore their connection to RR and the oil rig which means further research and development of technology.
---
 This time the enclave could be the sort-of-good guys since they haven't committed their atrocities yet(and we don't know if they ever will).
---
I'm gonna do that but for the Enclave in front of a Red Rocket.
---
I'd just be happy if they made pistol utility perks worth taking.
---
Still no  fixer or  radium skin. Any combat skin is not even applicable to fixer
---
fighting a BoS squad would be a lot more interesting than a few dozen armor-shredding mr. Gutsies.
---
I‚Äôve found what feels like every combination of legendary effects on every weapon in the game **except** for any bloodied + swing speed unarmed weapon.
---
Is there a unique noise?
---
Same on PS4. That works for all terminals, not just this one.
---
YESSS!!! THE FRIDGE IS BACKKK!! I KNEW ITTTT!!
---
Now I just need the roof fan and my camp is done!
---
Stand tall and proud
---
Yeah, 1:10 turn in to badge ratio seems about right to me
---
That's my guess. I could see also the fear of being kicked out.
---
Could be their friends logged in or are trying to join server and they want to play together.
---
Could be the team is bugged and won‚Äôt let you join because of ghost members.
---
Could be they want control and will switch between building and event as they do events (something I do)
---
Could be they want to rule with an iron fist and kick people that don‚Äôt share perks.
---
I do it to make sure that I have room for my friends
---
I only start a new team when i wanna play with my bf and there are no teams with 2 spots. Maybe this is a reason for others too, that there arent enough spots for friends
---
That one holds 2 more items without glass in the way, right? Sounds like a no brainer purchase for me.
---
Don't be sorry, it's the thought that counts.
---
Still waiting for that Fo3 handmade skin...
---
Some players cant join because some kind of error pops up. But some people just love to be leaders.
---
Just play in third person. Not a solution but this power armor skin actually started me playing that way and now first person feels weird.
---
I really hope they won't force everyone to go with BoS. I like idea of rebuilding modus Enclave too.
---
You know, there are actual good games out there you could spend your time on, hey?
---
You don't need to hop between two steaming piles of garbage.
---
boy they are so desperately trying to sell those ugly raider pa skins Xd
---
I can't stop myself from grabbing every desk fan and clipboard I see...I think I am good on screws.
---
Samsies!
---
Not really. There is a sound but generic.
---
I don't see it as much anymore, but it is weird to see one Events team with two players, and then two other people start their own. 
---
Also annoying: when there are twenty players on a server, and no teams.
---
When the cork part comes, I'm going to take care of all of you. I've got like, 21k cork burning a hole in my scrap box. I got you, wasteland, I got you.
---
I've been kicked randomly before so I prefer to run my own because I'll rarely kick, I also like to change my team goal depending on what I'm doing (which I've yet to see anyone else do when I play on random teams)
---
If you look at Bethesda official page for this week's Atomic Shop, it states available starting 8/13 for the banner.  https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4yv87wiyzzymMG5VPuyLuE/atomic-shop-weekly-update-august-11-18
---
No 4k exp
---
yeah, as I said its really just an accident sometimes :p
---
:)
---
yeah I can understand that! If they‚Äôve not moved for a few minutes then üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Yeah just checked as well but this is Bethesda and the sites manually updated so who knows if they just forgot or what
---
Kind of sucks, this whole "donate" steel, concrete, cork, etc is so Bethesda can do away with scrapping all together... 
---
We just drop items now, or sell them to BoS for caps to then buy pre-bulked materials. 
---
No more farming for mats, just caps. and the worst part is none of this is true.
---
With the fridge, can you store non perishables food items as well? Would be nice if you could so I can get get some better organization going.
---
Yes I know you can do that in the stash, but would prefer for food (and not Chems, serums, etc ) to only go in a fridge container. 
---
Also, how many items can it hold?
---
I would call it a ‚Äòbig‚Äô thing, but it is something with lasting consequences. It means all the robots in Watoga are now non-hostile.
---
Possibly they'd rather be team leader then some random so either they could:
---
-Have the ability to switch team goal on the fly, so that they can toggle it to event team at the end of events for extra xp and then back to build team
---
-They may be expecting a friend coming online later so want to he able to boot people off 
---
Or maybe they don't care to play with others, and just are turning public team on to get the bonus from herd mentality
---
Doing a trade and at the reset... ballsy
---
I did one where the other person kept turning off the jukebox. He was farming and wanted nothing to get in the way, including the event completing.
---
True in regards to the first point, my wife won‚Äôt join any team unless I‚Äôm in it, so I start one.
---
That would a be a decant idea.
---
I want to see vids of the two new emotes
---
To be honest secret service armor ruined all the other types. Wish each had a superior compared to each other. Like dr on metal and rad res on trapper. Secret service has everything. But it does lack in mods and you need to complete the heist for it. 
---
If brotherhood armor rolls out I want it not to be better stat wise but instead have new unique mods that can only be applied to bos armor.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if this is how it goes
---
*  they will take away half the plans that people do want, 
---
* add more versions of the common plans like the single-action revolver ivory grip plan, 
---
* add more common plans to make uncommon plans rare and rare plans have a .0001% drop rate (still better than OG Fashnaut
---
* it will probably have a bug where if get a plan that you already know, it will actually make you lose access to that plan, but you cant relearn it as it is marked as already known, and will take over a month or until after the event is finished for them to fix the bug.
---
* you will only get booze, caps, and scrip, and the rate that you get said currency is so high that you cant buy and resell stuff fast enough to prevent you from hitting the limits.
---
I really wish I wasn't so satirical about 76's updates, but their track record makes it feel like the shit above is not a far cry from what could happen.
---
ikr
---
We got it.  Yeah.
---
Best get to turning that cork in then so we can get a double points weekend!
---
That's usually what I do, but the problem is Scorched Earth. You can get staggered in 3rd person view. Overall it's my favorite PA skin, it's probably my favorite thing I've ever bought from the Atom Shop, but just wanted to let people know about it.
---
Fire proof 3 and a dense chest mod completely negates any health damage from explosive rounds and explosions of any kind. Go crazy with that.
---
Yeah I knew about starched genes,  I didn‚Äôt know it was a early unlock though.
---
Edit** just looked it up,  around level 30.
---
&gt;	I swear on the stack of my 9 copies of skyrim
---
Those are some rookie numbers!
---
They said that the 1st items show up in the special tab this month. Maybe they just put it there because it coincides with the BOS giveaways too?
---
Gotta do something during load screens
---
Thanks.
---
I vaguely remember when those exact bundles were released for the first time, there were some problems with them not being specific enough (e.g. an eyepatch being there and shown on a photo but not mentioned in the description or Gage underarmor shown in the other one, but not included, this kind of things) so, you know, better ask now than be sorry later ;)
---
Where's a good place to farm loads of stingwing barbs, though...
---
I have the same thing.
---
Upgrade
---
I think it just means its only back for fo1st members, and not available at all for others, not discounted though. I have 1st so cant test that though
---
Welp, looks like im a blood eagle now. Those are some legit items for them.
---
I always feel like an ass if i do that so i buy at least 600+ in ~200 increments.
---
I was so glad to be able to dress up my ally, she's wearing the whole outfit.
---
Oh Yeah! More Raider crap! :)
---
you know what that means...
---
Server hop. Sadly they will probably auto complete. That's what happened to me
---
Oh Finally!
---
(Runs screaming into the yard, excitedly digs hole with face)
---
For me, the fact if you accidentally lose one of the gear, it's gone forever, makes me not want to ever redo this quest line.
---
I lost my sword during one of the infamous gear loss glitches and could never get it back. The official solution was to roll an alt, do the quest line (which you really need to level up for) then hand the sword to a trusted 2nd player, then switch characters to my main and hope that 2nd player is around to give it back.
---
Instead of making it one of those 'gone if you drop it, but you can always remake it' kind of items.
---
I have about 50 items I can create that would vanish if I dropped it, but I can remake them all I want. The OOM gear needs to get this status, imho.
---
hahah they're really using some scummy tactics with this shit. Bundling up specific things you want with a bunch of shit so that for each of the good things you need to pay 1200.
---
yes
---
Just guessing, I believe I have clawed myself a whole pie since launch. So, eight times. (Unless you‚Äôre some kind of monster who doesn‚Äôt cut pie correctly.)
---
Tried server hopping, exiting and restarting, and soft reboot.
---
Exact same thing here. Bethesda sure has been coming in strong with the bungles this week.
---
Very true, thanks for the heads up on behalf of everyone else. It really is off putting how much of the screen gets blocked.
---
Order of mysteries and cult of the mothman definitely need some dlc .
---
We're finally getting some raider themed items
---
I hope they forget to take it off xD
---
We need a Where the Fuck Did the Body Fall emote for the tall grasses.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I guess I have to check out if it's still there then ;)
---
I'm maintaining my base in the Mire ready for underground bunkers to be added and the eventual return of some of the great characters \[Abby etc\]. I don't mind seeing the BoS back and the world building out  more but i am hoping that the Mire gets some development as there's a lot they can do there even just with combating the destroyed GECK-mutated vegetation etc.
---
I seen something similar. Guy got stuck at a terminal of a player who logged off. He was standing still doing the type gestures as he was scooting around. Pretty funny for a minute.
---
They are the first exclusives. Bethesda‚Äôs website explained it‚Äôs not on the 1st tab but those are them
---
True but it's fairly grindy to get it all. 
---
I agree with you though about differentiation...perhaps BOS could offer mods that give insane DR or ER or RR but not all 3. Mix and match among the five pieces to your liking. Oh...and a functional / modable helmet would be pretty sweet.
---
She is 100% why I love this whole sub-story within the Fallout Universe. Claudia Christian is 25 different kinds of awesome all at once.
---
They would be a list of exploits and work around tricks. Like make Gatling lasers for a free fusion core. Don't like nuke runs... pass through doors with photo mode. Check out this explosive bait trick. It would be glorious!!!
---
Does the blood eagles bundle come with an fu! Emote!?
---
I wore the veil of mysteries for a good 80% of my playtime until I got the marine diver face mask thing. May go back to it to respect one of the more interesting early quest lines.
---
Also the order of mysteries sword pierces armor naturally, if they gave it a legendary spawn possibility it would be the best one hand melee weapon in the game hands down. (With a god roll of course, but inate armor piercing is nothing to scoff at even with mediocre rolls.)
---
There's a lot I want to see done with early game factions like: The military, responders, fire breathers, free states, hell I'd appreciate pre war corporate as a faction with robots and stuff and especially the enclave.
---
But even though I like the firebreathers the most they got the coolest atom shop item ever which is the samurai outfit. But to my knowledge the order of mysteries hasn't got a single item involving them, so I'd put my bias aside to root for another faction.
---
Yes, I made a post like this a while back. Somebody suggested holding the fire button down to charge it like a gauss weapon, then releasing to fan a number of rounds depending on how long you held it.
---
Edit:
---
Here's the old post.

When I feel like I need a break from 76,I tend to go back to FO4 or NV,play at my own pace.
---
Yeah I figured that was the case. The website is slightly misleading though because they crossed the price out.
---
FINALLY! THE THANKSGIVING SHELF!
---
I just want a 90% reduced weight shovel for Buried with Honor
---
Personally, I want the Brotherhood of Steel to put a cork in it.
---
Reading this thread has made me realize I still have A LOT to find. 200 hours in and still finding new things, amazing.
---
Juuuuust barely
---
You get 50% at 0 dr and it scales to -50% at around 110DR, iirc.
---
So you'd be close to breaking even.
---
If you're not going to go full 0 DR it really isn't worth it
---
yep. It a whole "this is the start of something big" feel to it, only to end up being the finish of something medium by the time you are done.
---
I heard rumors that the person behind this storyline was moved to other tasks and that there were bigger plans for it via expansion and DLC that never came to fruition.
---
You will have to remove her terminal and build his chair.  
---
There is also a female singer that you can get.  The best place to find her is to server hop the small camp from the daily Photo Opportunity quest.  I found her there after 5 or 6 tries.
---
I get social anxiety joining teams because someone kicked me out before so I just make my own lol
---
Not sure what you are trying to say here, this has been known for a while, it‚Äôs the reason I have 13, after getting the High Cap plan and getting the Armoured plan for someone else. So 26 total badges, I heard that the drop rate is supposed to be about 30% which in my experience sounds about right.
---
Yeah I've played both and I've never had half the issues with 76 that I've had on RDO. In 76 I'll deal with the occasional bug or glitch that just makes me go hmmmm.... But I've yet to have any game breaking issue yet (except maybe when I started Beckett's quest). With RDO my camp constantly despawned, the modders and greifers were absolutely unbearable, missions just vanish halfway through. Animal spawns? What's that? Wagons and horses randomly blowing up. No rewards etc. Moonshine wagon despawns randomly. Only redemption red dead redemption has is the amazing world Rockstar built.
---
There's a dozen very good reasons why they should have removed the duped garbage and the people who duped them over a year ago, but here we are with none of that having happened. Wasting your time with mounted plan trash is probably the least significant of those issues, and it's still brought up often enough that you would think they would have done something about it
---
Wow, so now they are offering for free the stuff we had to purchase a few weeks ago?
---
Safer from hackers.
---
PC is best for singleplayer, I prefer console for any online/competitive.
---
Dude yeah.... This questline really fucked me up. Great stuff.
---
Anyone else not see enough distinction between these different brown outfits to justify the atom cost?
---
It still says it‚Äôs locked.
---
Ooh can‚Äôt wait to pick this up and give my bear collection an upgrade!
---
Please do this üôè
---
It most definitely DOESN'T cap at 25.  I've had mine to around 40 and I have incremental gains all the way up.
---
if there's a challenge for join a team or do X while on a team, and I don't plan on being on very long, (or not on long enough for the bonus link to complete), then I'll likely create my own team to complete the task.

I got my VEFR Railway rifle off one of my mules this morning using a suitcase at Whitesprings
---
Cool site to know if you‚Äôre sitting on something of value, but the appraisal value is super high. At some point the speed of making a sale and freeing up stash space has value too, so I typically price way, way under Fed 76 values. Good enough is good enough for me.
---
Thanks for the info, that's crazy... questioning my sub now.
---
To bad they were all fools who managed to be the only faction to get wiped out by something other than the scorched
---
I‚Äôd bet on something like the Raiders/Settlers faction stuff. Eventually have to side with one but could gain rep eventually through both?
---
There is some UI issue with your game. Wait awhile and let it properly load in. The free item is the sorry emote.
---
There's a tracker above. Says concrete is complete. Don't think the turnover has happened yet though?
---
Whichever you prefer or enjoy using.  
---
I use a bloodied heavy PA build for SBQ and Encryptid events and a bloodied commando for everything else.
---
There's always the guys running around and camping outside the back door killing everything before it gets to the door.
---
That makes sense... I mean imagine if Vault 51 had been the ‚ÄúDanger Room‚Äù in the Mansion of Mystery instead... how elegant that would have been. So different than yet another pointlessly sadistic AI.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
They still could!  :-)
---
You mean that the BoS will ignore the group producing military grade robots for conducting patrols across Appalachia, as well as deploying supplies from orbit, and more importantly, conducting orbital strikes across the area?
---
I‚Äôm inclined to disagree.
---
The tire set is nice for general camp building and such. Works nice to elevate your turrets and create barriers around your perimeter.   Good buy for your atoms.
---
Thanks op for posting!!
---
Hit 88 last night so not to long to go but half my gaming time I play other games so I'm not getting burned out yet
---
The official response I got from Bethesda:
---
1. make an alt
---
2. level up the alt
---
3. redo all the quests
---
4. give the items to a 2nd player
---
5. switch back to your main
---
6. hope to find 2nd player again and hope 2nd player is willing to give you your items back
---
Meanwhile, I have no less that 30 recipes for objects/items where if I drop them, they are destroyed, but I can make them anytime I want them.
---
All they have to do is create a kiosk inside the last locked chamber, and flag the items so they can't be dropped/traded.
---
I lost my sword due to a game glitch that vanished items. I fear losing my mask to the same error someday.
---
Pics?
---
sometimes i have no choice, the "cha-ching" noise shows up, then i am DCd, i tried yelling at my ceiling fan, the cereal boxes, and even the sun... nothing helps
---
Curious regarding this also, currently seems to be a free Fallout 1st exclusive according to the website. Within the game however, it's 500 Atoms?
---
Meh. I was thinking it might be something that could be spammed in the nuclear winter lobby

The in game dress looks like a scuba suit with a modesty skirt. horribly ugly.

Ya, the display should be in the atom shop all the time. Great piece!

It killed my interest in being part of GTAO‚Äôs subreddit.  For several years I was the ‚ÄúTip guy‚Äù that would show up in the comments and drop little known tips about GTAO that maybe not everyone knew and I‚Äôd get upvoted to the top comment spot.  But when it‚Äôs me going through 230 meme posts to find the one post where I can help someone, it became very not worth my time.
---
I wouldnt use the mutation till you're close.
---
aaronholt homestead up by the nw  lumber yard in the west side of the farm you get like 16 - 20 cranberries , 
---
make cranberry relish will still give you 10% xp boost till you get to level 30  stack with a well rested bonus and a 4 member  building team will massively help if you got unyielding armor too.
---
e.g  25 xp is the normal for discovering a new location , i average between 50 and 65 xp for this running my buffs 
---
handing in 3 dailies and doing one event  gets me 100 score now , its worth it.
---
i plant gourds at my camp and farm snaptail by flatwoods (the river to the right has like 50 of them)
---
i make 4-6 relish start of my play session and just have fun.
---
i imagine it would somehow kill us in the process... giving new meaning to the "fan death" urban legend
---
I got 1 during a Nuke silo run of all things out of about 300 hours of play time

Can we talk about how the use of the word "totem" in that Blood Eagle sculpture is (at best) tasteless, cultural misappropriation, and (at worst) racist.

I just wish Kent could have found out that his bestie actually was married to the Mistress of Mystery and took all of their lore discussions and made them in real life.

He never got to know that Fred was actually Fredrick Rivers and that makes me sad :(

Don't worry, I have another 20 in my cart in anticipation of cyber Monday

Yea you can have more than 25 points but if you were getting extra exp it was from somthing other than int. Dataminers have already gone in the code and proved this along with 25 charisma is cap for vendor discounts
---
I just made an Order of Mysteries secret mansion camp last week! I‚Äôll do a post later today. But yeah, this is one of the coolest factions, and I seriously cried at the end of the quest, and I was so angry and heartbroken.
---
I was heavily into RDR2 for a while towards the end of last year, played through all of the available content and then was waiting patiently for more, in the end I got sick of seeing GTAO still getting so much love and a plethora of new content while RDO got nothing. I ended up giving up and haven't been back since, from what I understand, they added the 3 roles and then no updates for 7 months or something until the most recent update added a new role? All I wanted were some more missions to continue on the story they started with RDO, it was the most engaging part of the experience for me.   
---
I've been playing 76 for 4 months and while it has been bumpy, atleast Bethesda have tried to continue releasing new content.
---
Coz I get sick of low levels thinking that coz I joined the team they can come and harass me with the trade emote. Only for them to shit a brick when they see how much you want for that 3 star bloodied GA. 
---
It's getting  boring now so I will make a team on my own and if anyone joins that's cool but at least I had a breather for a little while.
---
And FYI I have mutations for team play and I can't be assed to reset my mutations for the 20th time so I need to be in a team.
---
Side note: did we fail concrete? The reward still says locked
---
Modus is actually AC, but his avatar
---
I saw that but I mean in their weekleys atomic shop atrikel has ~~500~~ atoms but nothing behind so I wondered if it is supposed to be free
---
Eeeeeeeeeee!
---
I'm 100% down, as long as they don't bring back a surviving Mistress and make her the 'boss'. I've been running around saving Appalachia for over a year in that Garb. We should be the faction leader if they do give us more story.
---
I'd honestly settle for a nice outfit version of the Garb on the Atomic Shop, though. Then I could actually wear armor.
---
Well, today I learned.
---
i gave up and used headphones
---
Upgrade?
---
That's from about 2 days ago
---
(frustrated horse noise)
---
Um.... you know they changed the target right?
---
Also we hit the goal...
---
It‚Äôs been changed to 15mil concrete
---
Heads
---
Same!
---
I think eso‚Äôs system was better thought out personally, either a separate location or server to fight on and the rewards aren‚Äôt the best but they‚Äôre good enough that there‚Äôs no penalty to focusing on pvp rather than pve. It would work especially well for Appalachia with so much open territory to travel. You could have raiding parties to capture key locations, etc. and there could be additional pve elements like in nuclear winter so you can still enjoy the new gameplay even if it isn‚Äôt your thing
---
how about the undersides of the upper floors?

"Additionally, there are some congratulations in order! The community came together over the past week to deliver enough steel and concrete to ATLAS Observatory that everyone has unlocked the Brotherhood of Steel Military Beret and Standing Banner Rewards. Great work, Dwellers! Keep those supplies coming during [**Fortifying ATLAS**](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events), and everyone will earn even more rewards and events."
---
See? They even had the page ready and waiting to be published.
---
The cork doesn't sound quite as bad actually.  I mean it sounds bad, but it can be farmed from enemies.   I found you can get cork from scrapping pipe weapons. Killing all the mutants at Grafton Steel can get you quite a bit of cork.  Farming junk items from enemies is way easier than farming junk items strewn about in a shared world where anyone can loot it.  Cork doesn't sound great but man concrete is just awful.
---
My sniper can do 300-500 to the SBQ
---
My melee can do about 2000
---
I just don‚Äôt add any mounted heads, or ultracite plans, in my loot vendor. Also ignore night vision scopes. Instead I emphasize camp items, recipes for medicine and interesting plans and mods for big guns and other models that don‚Äôt drop often (ie hard to scrap for plan items)
---
FUCK I wanted that so bad but just last night used my 500 atoms on the vault tec gen which I also wanted but not as much.
---
that rocket golf club, fml
---
Doesn't that machine just give you one at random and immediately use it?  It'd be nice to just purchase what you want for later use.
---
Good on you though for the free drinks \*thumbs up\*
---
i forgot to add use "inspirational"  perk in the charisma tree also , i only have it rank 2  still massively helps.
---
(Todd face)
---
And a ‚Äúwhy did you freaking one shot the legendary!? It could have had the 3-star rolling pin I needed to finish my collection‚Äù emote as well.

---
Only perishables (and mentats for some reason), max limit is 15 items, and they don't stack when added to the fridge's inventory.
---
Yeah why are you posting this today when this was from a couple days ago?
---
(violently eats applesauce)
---
10 things I think.  The fridge is mostly for the cosmetic value imo. Looks nice for sure.
---
My brother leaves one unlocked and locked the rest.
---
My are all unlocked along with my scrap bin.
---
I feel they generate enough to share.
---
It does. Most people use them (and punchbowl) for Nukashine trips, but I wanted mine to just be Colas.
---
Okay, sounds good.
---
You forgot /s
---
meh, the concept of "totem" is in use worldwide, and thus is not, in my opinion, a reason for twisting of panties.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totem)
---
I had been wondering about this myself before in an older post, but I have seen some bugs with joining existing teams in the meantime, so now I just accept it as it is. I have been unable to join teams of two or three because of either A) team leader shown on the team logo as *offline*, or B) ERROR: team is already full (still showing only 2 or 3 members, though), ergo: ghost members, as others have stated.
---
I've also seen players start their own Building teams, then join mine after a few minutes.
---
Add me to the OoM is the best mission in Fallout 76.
---
Please do show them some love. I would gladly spend my atoms.
---
So, what did you need to be reminded of?
---
why? who are you?
---
The camp to me is the best part. So often I'm not near a stash box and loaded down. I just wish it came with a tinkering bench
---
boo
---
I like these little prefab 'mini buildings' I gotta say.
---
I would be nice if they updated the concept so that they were modular and you could stitch them together.
---
Thanks for the advice! I‚Äôd like to get her too. Space girl just complains all the time üòÇ
---
The spawnpoint can be changed by moving the camp in edit mode (or atleast that works with me) ,even tho i would like to see the rug as a spawnpoint again  :D
---
You took a screenshot then lived under a rock all weekend?
---
yup
---
I want that to be case but they are traditionally energy weapon users.
---
They reduced it to 15m and I'm pretty sure we managed to unlock it.
---
i'm sorry
---
O_O
---
*muh*...
---
Okay...first off, wow. I got 2 damage with strength of 19 or so. No other bonuses other than bloody mess...but that's about 15% so at that point hardly anything. Non-bloodied unarmed build so really not a whole lot else for me.
---
Fuck em and their quests
---
How apropos, given the recent avalanche of fuck-ups from Bethesda.
---
Gold Plated .50? But its in a bundle? Damn it
---
Feet. 
---
But also, if you want to make a nice looking kitchen area, some clean items like Unscorched Oven Mitt, Bread Box and Toaster, Cooking Oil and a Mutant Brain really tie a kitchen area together, next to a refrigerator.
---
Ah.. Didn't know you meant the website update weekly. Curious now aswell.
---
I believe all fridges can only slow down food spoilage by 50% and don't stack with spoilage perks. Only hold 15 items at most.
---
Actually great idea I‚Äôll try to find some
---
Wow thats a ton. What are your weapons‚Äô effects?
---
I usually make one if i'm gonna be trading with someone. I tell them where my camp is and that i'll be in a building team. So then they can join my world and join my team.
---
Pro strats FTW

Personally as a new player, I think it could potentially ruin the game for you making things way too easy. As a non subscriber I have never felt the need for it although it has been tempting for sure. I think the deciding factor comes down, if you buy atoms monthly then it is probably a no brainer, meaning if you say buy 1500 atoms each month constantly, then it may be worth it for you to subscribe instead and get the extra benefits. If you typically don't.
---
What I recommend is, play without it and enjoy the game as it was mean and if at some point you want to subscribe you can. A lot will tell you once you subscribe and get used to the unlimited stash, it is hard to go back. 
---
I am sure others will comment.
---
The point for this is instead of doing world challenges you can spam this multiple times per day, much easier compare to those tedious world challenges
---
I wonder your "known for a while" is about the glitch or about the "you can get badges by daily quests".
---
This is about a glitch that you can do a "Daily" quest multiple times.
---
Rebuilding it would be a cool quest line. You could do a daily recruitment quest, which would probably end up being a fetch quest overall, but when isn‚Äôt it a fetch quest? 
---
Maybe find someone to help create more radio dramas that will advertise for recruitments. Build up a radio tower or a hub within the manor to do it all. Have to scavenge the supplies to do it.
---
It seemingly is free to Fallout 1st members, at according to the "Atomic Shop Week Update August 11-18". It simply has a slash through its own 500 Atom price tag. Don't feel bad about your purchase though, the Vault Tech Generator is amazing and allows the ability to stack them on-top of each other. More practical use over the vending machine model change.
---
Survival tent and scrapbox are actually really huge. I spent much of my first two months playing just juggling junk and weapons, and ended up dropping stuff I would have rather kept. Since I only paid ten bucks for the game, I could easily justify investing in FO1st for a month or two. The tent has been super helpful but the scrapbox is the real game changer for a digital hoarder like myself. 
---
The good thing about first is that when you cancel, you still have access to your scrapbox (to take things out, but you obv can't add anything back) so it is feasible if you want to do FO1st every other month or even just one month and amass a huge stockpile to keep you in mats for a while. I've just completed my first month of the subscription and will let it renew another month. I wouldn't want to play without it.
---
YES. Gunplay in this game needs more flair in general and not when you get jumped by a ghoul and your character decides to spin the chamber while drawing.
---
Agree!
---
If you take damage after getting downed you will die, so if the laser hits you - it's not gonna stop when you get downed so you die.
---
That is not correct. From your own attached link:
---
&gt;While the term totem is derived from the North American Ojibwe language, belief in tutelary spirits and deities is not limited to indigenous peoples of the Americas but common to a number of cultures worldwide.
---
Furthermore, it's made pretty clear that the Blood Eagles are *not* Native American by any means; but just run-of-the-mill raiders. I'd even go so far as to say they're mostly white.
---
I won't be on for about 4 more hours myself. Ign is newt341.
---
i told myself once i need atoms ill buy it as a trial - i see it more as a commitment to purchasing 1600 atoms a month- couldnt be arsed about private servers
---
my fear is once i get used to that extra  space in the scrapbox ill never   give it up.
---
Ive played both since launch, going back and forth between both. These are some of my observations?
---
- Fallout 76 has always had more content compared to Red Dead. On RDO's launch, we had an unfinished storyline, and still do almost 2 years later.
---
- F76 had an entirely complete plot with side stories. - It took about 6 months for one major update for RDO with roles. F76 started getting content updates going into 2019. 
---
- RDOs character outfit customization is much better than Fallout's but Fallout has the upper hand on camp customization. 
---
- Both feature multiple currencies and a premium but... Rockstar did it better. RDO has gold and is easily attainable but still just enough to have to work for it; plus tokens to unlock the unlock for Role items (still gotta buy it with $ or gold) that unlock at each level of the role. Fallout 76...atoms...seasons...score..scrip..gold...ammo points...brotherhood steel bars (jk i hope not)
---
- Both major DLCs (Wastelanders and the Role system) added in grinds that have really badass content but can take a MINUTE to get. 
---
- Both games are very lonely, calm and relaxing if you're not worrying about the grind.
---
- Both games have fantastic, incredibly detailed maps and they're the best in their series (ik RDR2 is kinda cheaty, only 3 games)
---
- Both games are incredibly grindy, (ive yet to beat Wastelanders bc that grind doesn't interest me). Both games are very fun solo or with friends. 
---
- Bethesda needs praise for communication if we are comparing it to RDO and Rockstar... Yall heard of the Clown Movement? 7 months with no update...not even "sorry covid wrecked our schedule" from Rockstar. 
---
- I'm positive there are plans but no direction for either game as a whole. 
---
- cowboys yeeyee
---
- THERE IS TOO MUCH LORE MYSTERIES BOTH IN RDO AND F76 THAT WILL INEVITABLY BE IGNORED IN ANY SUBSEQUENT DLCS. 
---
I think I summed all my points up. I love both of these shitty games and know I missed some stuff as there are a LOT of similarities and comparables between both games.
---
PS: Red Dead Online is broken as of yesterday. There is not a single breathing creature out there...human or animal. Disconnects are about every 20 minutes. We have dailies too, but they are for a gold bar multiplier, steaks at 7 days, 14 days, 28 days. You see the problem if we cant log in... Also in Bethesda style, the new hotfix also brought nearly every bug back to RDO. Role NPCs and the camps are gone too. So its back to the Grief Grind of 2018...
---
We got the sorry one for free
---
The badges are actually dropping, the server gets the roll for it to drop, not me.
---
Tails
---
Oh my god...mobile fucked up my format. 
---
I had actual points to make I swear üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
you can still get carnivore and add like 170% flat with just meat items so it's still worth doing, I recommend butchers bounty, it makes it way easy to keep up
---
And just a bit of news, I got the flamer mod from a vendor today and went to hopwell cave, I was able to kill the level 90 deathclaw with my chainsaw \^\^ so that's a great start, also it almost instant kills thick level 60+ charred ghouls now, only problem is that being staggered causes me to need to rev up so I am forced to switch weapons most of the time
---
not fair, my joy was reading those crying for the fridge and diplay cases week by week
---
Thanks. Was the I‚Äôm sorry emote on there? Didn‚Äôt see it
---
In my experience with one violent night, the only thing you can count on getting is a 1* Nailer lol everything else is random. I've done UF more times than I can count, never get anything consistent.
---
I have been trying to join already existing teams for this reason, but I have been kicked for no reason. This just wastes my time as the bonding process takes time. I run two characters at the same time, so if either one of us is kicked, it is just a chronic waste of time for me, as leader I don't kick, so at the very least I know I will always have 2X bonding or more if others join which typically they do. Also I need two spots and most cases, teams have 3 people.
---
Gonna be spamming this bad boy...
---
Lol you burned yourself.
---
When you log into the game and the news tab pops up its on the news there. They are definitely the fallout 1st items.
---
Not 1:10 btw, the chance to drop is rolled by servers, had I a way to manipulate drop rate, I won't be sitting here playing FO76.
---
I believe it won an award or two.
---
That's why I picked up two of those 3\* rolling pins last week...they were meant for you!
---
F\*\*\*ing rolling pins....
---
That's kind of beside the point. There's are lots of emotes you can only get by paying extra for stuff you probably don't want.
---
It pulls scrap from inventory, stash, then scrap box then pull junk items to break down from inventory then stash
---
There is no way to better your odds. You just gotta grind legendaries or buy from player vendors. What one you looking for?
---
That used to work just fine. idk how it's changed since they reduced the timer, though. Haven't had to solo it.
---
F
---
Reddit. Lol its RNG no best place to find anything unfortunately. Its pure chance.  And very low chance at that   you xb1 or ps4? Throw up an ad.
---
Bleeding Kate's grindhouse guaranteed to have at least 3 to spawn every time you server hop
---
"bloodied builds are rapidly growing in popularity"
---
have they not been popular for awhile?
---
If you start with it, you'll like want to keep it. The Scrap Box and Tent are fantastic features and hard to let go of if you're used to always having them.
---
Save yourself a little money. Play until you're about level 30, get one month of 1st, cancel auto renewal, go to town. Use that tent, fill that Scrapbox to the brim. Then play a month or two without it. You'll still coast by on a ton of mats sitting in your Scrapbox that you can use your Stash for whatever. 
---
After the month or two without, repeat. Get a single month, abuse it.
---
I haven't bothered doing this, is it worth while, so if you doing an event, change it ? I generally just run building and leave it.
---
Mostly by the player that one-shots the legendary on purpose just to piss off the rest of the event participants.
---
Oh I'll buy every mounted head I see. I wasn't around when those plans were in rotation (given the comments, it was some holiday event? IDK), but I want every head I can get. I have actual mounted heads from some whitetails I've hunted over the years in real life. So I have a second house in fallout for my vendors/guest house where I keep my workshops, and I'm trying to put one mounted head for each animal in fallout to make it like a hunting cabin/log cabin in the game
---
Everyone reading this and still experiencing the auto complate bug even though they said it was fixed.. Keep making those bug reports on official website. This is a fanbased sub.
---
It‚Äôs not that they were forgotten, it‚Äôs that you can‚Äôt really do much with rifles. There‚Äôs already laser, plasma, and gauss rifles, you can‚Äôt do anything with energy weapons, and there‚Äôs tons of ballistic rifles. It would be pointless to add new rifles that just look different, and the fixer/handmade are already powerful enough.
---
the people who are really in for a surprise are those that think the BoS update is going to be a single content dump like Wastelanders. They teased in the Q&amp;A that it will be "spread out over several batches" and went on to say that some of the content is even coming *next year.*
---
Its a solid bundle all around. An outfit and related underarmor plus that eyepatch were enough for me lol
---
irl?
---
"I want more emotes"
---
"We got the sorry one for free"
---
"That's kind of beside the point"
---
that was a fun exchange
---
Yep! Cosmetics would be the main reason I‚Äôd get it, but if it did organize food for me easier, that‚Äôs be great too.
---
Wish it was an actual face. I'm practically at the end.
---
You got a laugh out of me. Is there something to do with staying logged in that auto completes your Dailys when they roll over? I have had it happen once and would prefer to never have it happen again.
---
it is a dance
---
I think they need to out around the time of the Enclave or whenever the mysteries of the isolated cabin are revealed.
---
sorry
---
It just looks good, even empty.
---
The whole atom shop is pretty much designed for whales. I would be inclined to buy a lot more things from the atom shop if they sold them individually or let players create their own bundle. Something like for 1,000 atoms you get to pick any three items in the atom shop. 1500 you get four. 
---
Like the fence walls. I would love to have them for my camp but not at that price. Especially when the other items are not worth it to me. I would never use them.
---
The Order of Mysteries made me fall in love with the game. In fact, all of the native factions to 76 did, but the Order especially. I love the BoS but they are definitely overplayed and I was really hoping for a Responders/Free States/Order update long before the Brotherhood showed up.   
---
I mean it's pretty ludicrous that there's an update featuring a cross-country expedition across an atomic wasteland before any of the easily resurrectable factions of 76.
---
I think I have a spare you can have depending on what kind of explosive shotty you want
---
The whining about the brotherhood in this post really drags down the primary suggestion in my opinion.   
---
I would like to see more Order of Mysteries stuff in the atomic shop, but we really need more BoS themed camp items for the enthusiasts as well.
---
Ya, ‚ÄúGreat with salt‚Äù seems to be better than everything else as far as preservation goes. 
---
I have that perk on at all times.
---
A freebie and actually wanting to buy other emotes on their own that are locked inside a bundle are completely different things.
---
Heavily debating on getting this bundle. What do you think?
---
A noob with only one monitor who wants you to chat with him even though he won't see it? Sounds like fun times.
---
Discount % are not always the same. I have seen 90% off on things before.
---
Oh okay, thanks.
---
wendigo is bae
---
Sorry its late
---
pretty sure it cant be traded  once crafted can someone confirm? , if im wrong ill sell you one  its a small backpack tho.
---
The outfit ruined it for a lot of people , most of us don‚Äôt wanna roll around in a dress. If they had an option to wear it like a shirt tucked into slacks I would probably still be wearing it
---
Guilty of using the punchbowl for said purpose.
---
Maybe, just maybe... The context was that as a player identifying as an enclave general, the bos making unreasonable demands of scrap for shitty rewards is already irritating. This isn't a lore video or Wikipedia, it's just reddit...
---
RIP my collection.
---
stupid events seems to drop them as rewards lately, i.e. Monster Mash, enclave nonsense, (blank) horde cranberry bog/mire, Todd's Face, even the Guided Meditation
---
my preference runs toward Non-addicted Full Health Riflemen and Commandos...
---
The fact alone that Bethesda actually communicates with their players in an active and often daily manner about what is going on is what is Bethesda‚Äôs biggest saving grace.  If R* communicated with their community like Bethesda does then they would have the most rabid and loyal fan base in all of gaming since they have catered to almost literally every demand the players have ever made; this latest update of QoL requests prove that.  Instead, they choose to use total radio silence and you having faith in them (which you can actually count on, believe it or not) as opposed to even the smallest hint of care.
---
I dropped First when they did the wall thing last update. That wasn't the only factor but with everything else, sheesh.
---
IT HAS!?
---
EDT: WOOO!
---
I'd love running into BOS.  I can get more plasma and fusion/fusion cell ammo from their dead bodies.
---
PREACH!!! I want more of them so badly!! IMHO, that was the best story/quest in the game, and heartbreaking to boot, and all I want is to pay tribute with OoM camp decorations, and to revive the Order and start recruiting folks again. Let us fix up the manor, get the training room functioning, and bring back the ass-kicking ladies! I nominate Daguerre as the first new initiate. Please, Bethesda, if you read reddit at all, I NEED this! As it is now, we get one lighted poster only, and the Mistress has to share space with the other Unstoppables on it! Show her some love!
---
You can avoid the clipping by taking off your current under armour.
---
Depends on your camp- I have different nuka colas in one and the robot models in another. I use to have board games, a typewriter, tea pots, and other clean ‚Äújunk‚Äù for a nice country home feel. The body parts in jars fill it up nicely too.
---
This is a dope week.
---
You know what, you‚Äôre technically not wrong.
---
"symbol that serves as an emblem of a group of people"
---
fair by me
---
I repeat, meh.
---
The helm from the fashionable raider outfit might be a good one for that - it's basically a catchers mask with a winter tuque.
---
Negative. It's from INT.
---
For me, up until now The Legendary Run has been pretty flawless (as far as bugs go.) but now I have 3 weeklies auto-completed, and same with my dailies (Both of which are Level Up so I just got screwed out of 2'000 Score there.) 
---
I'll tell you right now, this Legendary Run was already grindy.. I feel sorry for the people effected by this bug more than once, because  this just sucked out what ever enthusiasm I had for this game and gimmick. I was planning on playing this game primarily until Cyberpunk came out, but now I am willing to play until my Fallout 1st runs out, and then back to the trash heap with this game.. Not to be touched for another 2 years.
---
It should be under the ???
---
I'm only one-handed so it can go higher. But I've got Strength at 15, all Gladiator Perks, Incisor, and Martial Artist. Bloody Mess and Radicool. Adrenal Reaction, Twisted Limbs, Class Freak 3, Starched Genes 2, and Herd Mentality (a lot of other mutations).
---
I use a simple Bloodied Faster Swing Speed Machete with Sacrificial Blade mod.
---
I'm not even at full Unyielding for this character yet, only two pieces. But a few have Increased Sneak bonuses, and I've got max Ninja Perk. Chow down on some Deathclaw Steak and Glowing Meat Steak, pop some Psychobuff, then crouch under the Queen as she lands and just keep swinging at the head.
---
I have it, it's pretty dope yea  
---
says "BIZZNESS" on the tip of the barrel lol
---
(imagines a whale in the ocean, thinking about atom shop bundles)
---
Ack. I won't be home for like 4 more hours to see. So were you able to get this for free or will it charge the price it should be?
---
Yes. That‚Äôs how I got 26 of them, there is what 10-12 World challenges? 
---
It was why pre-patch ?? When they protected the bug parts from the auto-scrapping, prior to that people were putting the bug parts in their vendor for 25k so that they had a supply of parts to hit this repeatable as often as they could. 
---
The ‚Äúability‚Äù to do multiple times a day is a bug/exploit not part of the design.
---
I think a tea pot and a lighthouse souvenir would look really good thanks!
---
Any bloodied build will be good. But the top two would be stealth commando and PA heavy gunner (or even non-PA heavy gunner). While bloodied melee (or better yet unarmed, 1H and 2H not so much) will do great damage you will miss alot of enemies on events etc as ranged people will shoot them before you have a chance to run in to hit/tag them.
---
Well seems like since we got a free emote this week all the pea brains are just going to focus on that, not the fact there's countless other things people would buy if they weren't forced as part of a bundle.
---
Then maybe look at the one above me and explain it to them
---
Their goo piled hands can touch my plasma bolts.
---
I didn't even know I needed this until now. Yes, please, a million times!
---
Any legendary enemy has the same chance at dropping it
---
I‚Äôve seen a few people store urns, plates, and vases on them. I reaaally liked the look of that. 
---
Of course, teddies are a must for many. 
---
Also the robot models
---
Given that rifles where and still are the meta choice I think Bethesda left them out of the loot pool on purpose to get us all to try different weapons.
---
a rug and the slocum joe vending machine
---
Genius
---
Ight chief you do you, I‚Äôm gonna go skin some hapless traveller as an offering to my new sick ass metal god
---
Isn't  it the due at Atlas who is collecting it ? All on his own initiative ? The BOS didn't ask for it.... The radio message doesn't say anything about needing supplies as far as I can tell.  So maybe blame crazy guy instead of the BOS ?
---
I hope they'll at least care if you've completed the Appalachian BOS questline or not.
---
Last weekend was an insane SBQ event, obviously put on by a well coordinated team.  The blast zone didn't include Forward Station Delta, so (like everybody else) I fast travelled there.  They had built a huge arena (complete with bleachers) that gave people a place to stand, while also funneling the scorched into  a bottleneck for easy kills.  The queen was taken down in less than 10 minutes, and then the other silo launched a nuke about 5 minutes later.  Rinse and repeat, again, and then the THIRD nuke dropped.  Three SBQs downed in about 30 minutes.
---
You're kidding right? The Free States couldn't even keep Thunder Mountain Power plant away from Taggerdy's Thunder.
---
You can try to email Todd, and he'll change the slocum music to the slocum/fasnacht remix, but it follows your character at all times, even into NW
---
Grognak was sold outside of a bundle. 
---
And tricentennial wasn‚Äôt in a ‚Äúbundle‚Äù but it was in a cash add-on, so I guess that counts.
---
OoM has a decent story, but I don't wanna have a male character wearing a dress.
---
The gauss shotgun is a grind but at least you can buy the plan and roll as many legendaries as you like to get an Instigating, or bloodied or whatever floats your boat. They are all explosive.
---
Could you link a PA heavy gunner build please?
---
I feel like stealth is hard to maintain when you're doing Scorched Earth or farming a nuked whitespring resort.
---
it seems not, just a better price
---
edit: the emote apparently xd
---
I finished yesterday because I play constantly, probably won‚Äôt effect my game time in the slightest but I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt be hunting critters in NW or chewing bubblegum anymore lol
---
Here you go:
---
* Shoot humanoids in the head. Shoot robots in the leg.
---
* Hotkey purified water.
---
* Drop an empty power armor frame in a doorway to block enemies.
---
* You don't need to carry around 100 stimpacks, you god damn hoarder.
---
* Stash your junk before entering any workshop area.
---
* Stable flux always sells.
---
* People who lock their water purifiers are garbage in the sack.
---
* Equip Mr. Sandman FIRST, Covert Operative SECOND.
---
* Hold on to your Trail Fireworks.
---
* Concentrated Fire + Targeting a Sentry Bot's fusion cores = KABOOM!
---
* Fighting ghouls? Bring a Disease Cure or two.
---
Buddy of mine just told me that its green on the website. It's not updated on my phone. Check on a computer.
---
Seems more of an 'inverse funnel' than a pyramid scheme.
---
Where do you get the robot models at?
---
I never lock mine...
---
[support site](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
Mine is:
---
S4 P13 E4 C4 I5 A13 L14. But could be more fine tuned for min maxing.
---
Strength is max blocker and a touch of bandolier
---
Perception is max commando cards, tank killer, one in concentrated fire
---
Endurance is radicool, rejuvenated, and fireproof
---
Charisma is inspirational/friendly fire + strange in numbers/travel agent
---
Intelligence is nerd rage and 2 in gunsmith/demo
---
Agility is max adrenaline, covert op, 1 in gunfu, sneak, escape artist
---
Luck is bloody mess, serendipity, crit savvy, grim reaper sprint/tormentor, starched genes
---
Full set of unyielding, mixed scout and combat, several with ap refresh, a poison resist, and a sneak piece. Some various weight reduction (food/drink/chem is nice to have, saves perk points) 
---
Main weapons are Bloodied 33% vats accuracy 15% crit fill handmade. Means I only need one rank in concentrated fire, and I crit every other shot. I also have a Medic's Fixer for use as a support role. Secondaries are a vampire's rapid 10mm pistol and a faster swing speed shiskkebab (for healing npcs at events)
---
Mutations: adrenal reaction, eagle eyes, marsupial, bird bones, herbivore, herd mentality.
---
I have a TSE Gatling Gun and its my go to weapon for just about anything.  I also have a Bloodied Shovel, when I get bored I pull that thing out just to hear the metallic thunk! it makes when it hits something.
---
Now Johnny One-Shot can one-shot everything and then be "sorry for that"
---
Yes it's terrible that native peoples today are stealing that term from my ancient Celtic ancestors. That is indeed tasteless.
---
I have a BE+1p single action that one shots almost everything and that's without any pistol perks. I like it more than my BE25 10mm pistol because I can instantly fire from VATS if it's holstered. It doesn't require that I chamber a round like the 10mm.
---
Press and hold the back button. B on xbox.
---
Of course the one time i go on holiday that damm display case comes back üòï
---
New prefab rocks. I got it and it has just enough room for all my vending machines and a box. It eats up so much less space than the garage, and it‚Äôs less buggy too
---
I hate to say it, but it‚Äôs all a toss up, man. You never know with the Atom Shop. Some items come, then come back 6 months later while other items pop up every other freaking week. You can buy it full price today, only to find it 30-50% off tomorrow.
---
Welcome to the roulette wheel my friend.
---
Edit: spelling
---
i got a kick out of Penelope Hornwright being a ghoul in wastelanders.
---
The issue is they killed off the main characters in the Oom questline.
---
But would be cool to revisit it down the road.
---
Dispenses, similar to a punch bowl
---
Do you have the source for how it was done before? Please provide.
---
Maybe I did my homework badly before posting this?
---
And can you explain why the method you specified is not found easily when someone wants to know a way to farm possum badges quickly?
---
I wonder that sometimes too. The bonuses are greater with more members, so I can only guess that they intend to have other friends join and the existing team didn't have enough spots open, maybe? Or they want the freedom to change group goals on the fly.
---
It‚Äôs been a bug for about a year. When I reported it a year ago everyone made me out to be crazy. It‚Äôs when the yellow text in the top left corner pops up. Apparently it happens after playing Nuclear Winter.
---
most of the time yes but in this one you can buy the other things alone.
---
unless you just wanted the emote... rly? a fking emote is all that you want?
---
I think sometimes we forget in the face of the grind, that the game is about roleplaying and having fun with it. You can 'beat' the game with damn near any equipment. A friend and I took down SBQ on a private server yesterday in about a minute.   
---
The fight would not have been less rewarding if it took a bit more time and we had some fun with it.
---
It's a glorified punch bowl that you can stock for camp visitors
---
The tea pots are nice! Only thing about the lighthouse was that it clips through the top since it is so tall.
---
Jesus, and here I thought you people didn't really exist.
---
You could take up collecting and displaying 3\* shovels like I did...Sometimes I add in the pitchforks or picks, but mostly just the shovels...so many shovels...
---
they are here for tech
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken, they do not.
---
This Is one of the more memorable quest I did.kinda bummed I was never able to use that training room...its perfect for a small death match or free for all
---
Hell yea im definitely getting that.
---
The OP just *thought* they were on a private server, but they were on a public one, obviously. About the private transfer not working after the patch: I only saw (sparse) anecdotal evidence of that being the case. I have transferred lots of stuff that way since the patch, without a hitch. The private server crashing on you always was a remote danger, but I'm guessing user error is the more likely suspect: people waiting more than a few minutes before rejoining, or the router reconnecting in the background without them noticing.
---
google "todd bethesda"
---
I finished and I'm at 100. I just stopped playing altogether. Waiting for new content
---
So not a one thought to just fix/activate the jukebox?
---
I still wear the tattered dress on one tune. It still is technically the best overlay, it gives you 1 perception point. Just have to put a dress on that big strong body üòÇüòÇ looks good on mine though.
---
Yellow / Pink / Indigo are the 3 rare colors for baseball bats, they drop as non-legendaries :)
---
I have seen a bug that prevented me from joining a not full team once but it fixed itself after awhile somehow
---
This is the going theory. I always log out 5 minutes before and log in 5 minutes after, and have never had them auto complete all season. Seeing this while logged in, makes me think what happened to me is normal and somehow bugs out and stays that way permanently, because people have said they've logged on to 5/9 challenges completed or whatever
---
That‚Äôs what I was assuming.  I already have that one.  I got excited for a minute seeing it listed with the other regular vending machine styles and was speculating there may be a new Nuka -Cola themed vending machine coming out.
---
The  cause of the lag is nothing related to the tent magic, lol.
---
Its happening at radiation rumble also. maybe there is a tent too.. hmm.
---
I have this weird feeling that they released this with a discount both as a fulfillment of community request, but also to precede the possible ‚Äòimproved camp item placement‚Äô update I heard was coming. 
---
For example, if they make it so it‚Äôs easier (or possible) to place more items on more items, then there might be less interest in this display. 
---
I could be over analyzing it. Ideally, I like both approaches.
---
The robot at white springs train stations sells bulk cork for me , not sure if it‚Äôs a first comers situation or not but I definitely buy it there all the time now knowing I‚Äôll need it
---
All the stuff I want appears the week after I waste 400 atoms on this dumb shed.
---
Ign?
---
About 1h and 20 min from now, send me a friend request.
---
Same. It's all rng76.
---
I have found them at RobCo (where the AWOL Armaments event is) and you can sometimes find them on the bodies at the mothman shrine tree near Point Pleasant. 
---
Oh and you can get the chess pieces that also look like the robots from one of the fraternity houses in Morgantown.
---
My build does so much damage at this point that glow sight is nigh useless for me sometimes. I usually just leave in Green Thumb and whatever else is appropriate, like a level 2 refractor.
---
Her husband is technically still missing so /could/ in theory be alive somewhere and return to assist and act as a mentor/quest giver and keep the role of Head Mistress vacant (out of respect for his dead wife) but I totally agree about a clothing version for above the armour so we can actually sport our garbs and not be vaporised.
---
I usually have carnivore so I'll give it a try. I didn't know that food bonuses stacked like that.
---
The flamer mod is a lot of fun. I wonder if the perk that gives you faster swing speed on melee weapons works with the chainsaw? I have it and it might help ramp up the damage even more.
---
(chews bubblegum with popcorn)
---
there is no safe place
---
Sweet headed there now thanks!
---
I haven't had any problems with people trying to trade or ask me to change my load out. Guess I have just been lucky
---
No idea. Maybe hes a former office worker and wants to plan ahead for all the bulletin boards he wants to put up around the office ?  Gotta hang those cat posters somewhere.
---
\*Hang in there!\*
---
Isn't it just a fist?
---
Does your shotgun have instigating? Medics? Bashing damage or limb damage? Those are just a few effects that can trigger ‚Äúmagic‚Äù damage but with shotguns it only works in vats. If you‚Äôre one shotting max lvl enemies in vats but not outside of vats than your shotgun is dealing magic damage in vats. Not targeting the head of course just regular ol vats to get a clear test. It‚Äôs hard to tell with instigating though because instigating on a shotgun even out of vats is pretty devastating. And yeah it is disappointing:/ I hope bethesda fixes these things they‚Äôve been around for awhile.
---
feral ghouls...
---
also.. 2shot sucks.. accuracy is lacking.. get rid of that shit
---
Yup. Imagine a quest line where we restart the Order. Rebuild their headquarters, go on missions for them, recruit NPCs. The potential is endless.
---
I make a point to check whether anybody is at my CAMP before logging out. I want them to buy my stuff. And I don‚Äôt want to be rude if they‚Äôre using my workbenches or something.
---
Last night, I had somebody who just wouldn‚Äôt leave, though. I know he had already checked all my vendors and it seemed like he was just hanging out and wasn‚Äôt taking my hints, so I finally gave up and left him alone on that dusty hillside.
---
maybe hes a golfball manufacturer, and that's where Whitesprings gets theirs
---
Lol your like my buddy, he never played any FO before and thought 76 was great.
---
He's now playing New Vegas and FO4 and now reality is setting in for him.
---
Canadians will be pleased.
---
Other night I was playing and when I goto whitespring station I always check the suitcases and stuff being I‚Äôve found random stuff there. Well the one next to scrip machine has 878 stims and some lead ore. I grabbed them being no one was around so I don‚Äôt know if they thought the same thing or what. Who carries that many stims with them. I thought I was bad at around 150 total
---
How in the world did you miss all the posts
---
Just don‚Äôt scrap them like I did before you get them in your display üò©
---
I really wish I didn't hate that vendor....
---
Homeboy is learning that at atlas with all those nukes comming down.
---
No icon..
---
Imagine thinking a sorry emote is something to celebrate, after two years? You shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for emotes wtf, especially something so basic as saying sorry
---
I have never reported a player before on any game but I think if I saw that it would be my first time. Hopefully there is a report option for trolling hahhaha
---
Where does the Fridge show up in the build menu?
---
I've never actually thought about the Order of Mysteries that much. Can someone fill me in?
---
A lot of this stuff I feel should be in the base game already. It‚Äôs ridiculous
---
It‚Äôs updated manually. I imagine they have to talk to each other at Bethesda to figure out what‚Äôs the next action.
---
Oh I think it does work, incisor for armor penetration too, I am using it but I'll need to test it now that I think about it as I have never unequipped them, I'll probably do that tomorrow when I do further testing, I already logged off from the game for the day
---
I still dump plans I know but are poor sellers at train stations, and this includes all the ultracite plans I get from SBQ fights. I don‚Äôt have infinite space to wait for buyers when other stuff sells faster.
---
I run 2 characters: a bloodied, stealth, vats commando and a Junkies power armor heavy gunner. Both are fun, both do lots of damage.
---
I will say the junkies was faster to set up. Pick your drugs, buy a good weapon or two, get a set of power armor crafted for you (my first was T51, cost me a few thousand plus the frame and flux for the mods) while you work towards strangler heart or t65.
---
The bloodied was a looong grind to get good armor and weapons. It's also more challenging: maintain stealth, watch health/rads/food. Much more ammo efficient tho.
---
Oh Boy, howdy, Well, it turns out that good ol' Two-Shot stole fizzy lifting drink from Todd... and my-o-my what a scramble that a was... 
---
now Todd made ol' Two-shot more like a half'n'half of cream than a double shot of sour mash
---
Under the appliances section my good man.
---
Damn, I have a stalkers something crippling something (I forgot the third effect) and I can usually one shot ghouls but can‚Äôt one shot for example King‚Äôs (takes 2-3). I can do about a quarter of that damage when outside of VATS, but I also have the VATS damage perk card so IDK if that has any thing to do with it.
---
literally throwing money at my screen at this!!
---
Honestly find what works best for you, but I would recommend a junkies/bloodied hybrid, its as much to do with gear as it is points so you want a few bolstering pieces and a few unyielding, adrenal reaction mutation. With half health and a junkies rifle I am nearing one shorting everything. 
---
Or go full bloodied, just remember you are going to want to take a lot of defensive perks.  Lower quality items items like trapper and wood with sentinels will give you better DR than bad rolls on a good piece.
---
Have to hold B to exit the menu. I learned this at level 90. I'm more bothered by how non-user-friendly the interface is.
---
Display bat... you could be batman
---
Wow, good find I hope who finds my drop is low level so it can help them out I know for sure the final word 3 stars l50 was in that drop.
---
It looks like the weekly specials are vending-related.  Does the Nuka Cola vending machine act like a normal player shop?
---
Is..... Is that a fridge?
---
Fo4 wins over 76 fir me but prolly just cuz of the mods.  I like playing with other players in 76
---
Lol thanks gave me a chuckle.
---
"well um. We fucked up.  Tried to make it easier. They failed.
---
Should we give the banner?
---
Pff not free. 500 atoms for their failure.
---
But..
---
THIER FAILURE"
---
It's the ghost of Johnny Guitar. You get used to it.
---
Upvote for having the idea of using the neon lights to say ATLAS.  I really wish I would have thought of that.  I'll have to keep this in mind for future events.
---
Just checked there too. The arrow with the word concrete is green but the reward in rewards section still has the greyed out 'Locked' above it- unlike the baret that has a green 'Unlocked' over it
---
Dude I love this car, there‚Äôs one of these in my camp and it looks really nice in my raider corner
---
Finally! I needed raider related stuff for my new town camp
---
Well there are many small variations you can pick and choose but this could be a good starting point for a person who is not familiar with bloodied builds.  [The Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e344f5b&amp;d=sq2s32sr2sg2s01pe2eh2eu0c62ce0ic2s12ip2id2ir2a04l71lg2lt2lu2&amp;w=c72&amp;m=0c29feba). You can use energy or ballistic weapons with this build/mutations.
---
Most important thing for a bloodied PA build is *Nerd Rage* perk, *Adrenal Reaction* mutation, *Emergency Protocols* power armor chest mod and of course staying just below 20% health to benefit from *Nerd Rag*e.
---
*Ricochet* perk can be a little misleading when you read it and lot of people don't know why it is good perk for PA bloodied. When you deflect something with it, that shot will do 0 damage to you. So it is basicly a good'ish replacement for *Serendipity* that does not work with PA's. Other option for those 3 perk points would be *Dodgy* perk in agility.
---
Melee works just fine. The only problem you might have is idiots mowing down things during events. The queen can even be killed with melee once you learn how. 
---
i have an unarmed build that is pretty great. Hits hard and fast. Benefits from both twisted muscles and talons mutations.  I can tank most hits and scorchbeast barely tickle me. Thats without secret service armor as well. i run a mix of vanguards and other effects rather then just full vanguard armor.  Full urban scout armor.  Still relatively strong in nuke zones with the Chinese stealth armor. 
---

---
Edit : forgot to mention you can‚Äôt wear power armor with this build. Unarmed weapons can‚Äôt be used in power armor and you will lose some damage resistance from perk cards as well.
---
I've never seen any of these üòß

This is the best build of that type in my experience. I started my main as this when I moved from PS4 to PC. It's amazing and he's a great YouTuber. I tweaked it here there for my own preferences but not by a lot. Hope this helps! See you in the wasteland.
---
Yeah, I did have that in mind when I saw it..
---
Sent
---
Yeah, it is, my friend is so happy with it lol
---
I can't wait to put it down! You got me excited to build a camp again!
---
You can always add the player and send them a message asking if you can shop from them at a later time. If they have cool stuff in their vendor, they‚Äôre most likely willing to sell it, may just be at max caps, or it‚Äôs bedtime, who knows
---
I can see the first 2 as being reasonable and smart game play but I am unfamiliar with herd mentality. Don't you get more bonuses from more teammates and I guess I have been lucky with teams in that no one else has bothered me when I am on one
---
Love that camp.  Maxson's Folly is a great name.
---
That damn sexy troll of a man.. makes me so mad but.. ughh
---
It's like a love hate relationship
---
god i hope they finally give the workshop persistance update they promised with 1st
---
my camp isnt enough for all of these
---
I have a B/33/15 Gauss Minigun and it does sooo much damage. Of course, I can only use it on big stuff. It melted the Behemoth at Abandonded Bog Town in less than a second. I carry around a bunch of heavy guns (bear arms) and swap between them depending on what I'm fighting/what ammo I want to use up.
---
Try server jumping or logging off and wait a bit.
---
Of all the evil things....
---
You won't get sneak attacks if the enemy is agro'd on anything, doesn't have to be you.
---
I wouldn't mind some love for the order of mysteries but maybe they should consider redesigning the dress? It kinda sucks ass compared to other super heroes costumes in the fallout universe, even the Mechanist's suit looks better than the costume of the order of mysteries.
---
People (myself) just collected the parts in bulk as part of their standard farming method (we had a period of 2-3 weeks where Bloatfly glands were very hard to come by) storing the parts in the Stash (Pricing them in Vendor was to prevent them being scrapped during crafting)
---
Then, we would log in, check the personal terminal to see if the Scout Leader has reset, then grab 1 of each of the parts, go to leader, unlock the level 2 door at the back of the hut, trigger the roach (cry if it didn‚Äôt spawn) talk to the leader (activating the quest) loot the room he‚Äôs next to, on the way out of the room hand in the quest, continue about your day.
---
Fucking spit my coffee out, asshole!
---
Outstanding!
---
(Todd face intensifies, yet remains the same)
---
I agree. 
---
the portable tent, player icon, emotes. Should all be separate for each character.
---
I am hoping that the instanced camps will be somewhat like what you did with Vault 88 in the Vault-Tec DLC.
---
Same for me, and Wasteland 3 should release around the time i reach 100.
---
Make it a mutation. Agree
---
no- beth
---
They dropped the limits
---
because it's a weekly offer
---
Why would you assume we failed?
---
"Drei Gl√§ser!"
---
Inglorious Basterds is one of my favorite movies of all time. My Xbox Live account is even named after the movie: SgtHugoStigIitz.
---
But yes, I have a raider character who would never use the Tricentennial emote, and probably wouldn't apologize either. That's a good idea.
---
Communication is not Bethesda‚Äôs strong suit so I‚Äôve no idea what‚Äôs giving you that idea. Community managers do not equate to communication. They said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre aware and working on it‚Äù for bugs beyond half a year ago. A quick example is the fast travel bug. 
---
They‚Äôve also lied to us in the past. The fact that the legendary masks were ‚Äúunintentional‚Äù yet somehow they went unnoticed for over half a year of testing in the PTS and then a month after release. Then people start saying that they wouldn‚Äôt buy any head gear in the ATX if it couldn‚Äôt work with the mask. Suddenly it‚Äôs unintended and would you care to guess what they started selling not two weeks later?
---
They haven‚Äôt said a peep about hacked items in PC and they‚Äôre turning a year old soon. They often ignore to comment on specific elements outright. I remember that either ~~19 or 20~~ (further back) had some issue. If you dug around you‚Äôd find a ton of posts regarding some issue going on. Yet the only [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e6xtpr/i_build_a_cute_carousel_camp_that_kills_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) from bethesda during that time was about how cool some camp looked that was turned into a death trap carousel. Communication is not their strong point
---
E: remember when seasons were announced and everyone was freaking out about if future ones would be paid for? Rather than a 5 minute update saying no, they let it run wild for a weekend after everyone freaked out and the you tubers went crazy with it
---
golf balls and baseballs have it, people who farm a lot of plastic (aka shotgun players trying to make shells) get cork as byproduct
---
I have one but only 1 star
---
That could be it too. If the second shot didn't hit, that could explain the damage drop off
---
when they update it
---
Besides it was a good way of building in a delay of they needed to push back release
---
To what for cork?
---
(furiously shits confetti stuffing)
---
Can't you check your recent players list for this person instead of posting here where they are never going to see it
---
Wait where is this is it in now. Thanks I nearly missed this again.
---
It was bizzare that we couldnt mention the enclave to them but could to a bunch of soldiers
---
We did both event on a private and public too, noone used teslas or any energy weapons just ballistic, and the result was the game became almost unplayable.
---
So i think i can say its pretty sure not about teslas or energy weapons.   
---
The meatpiles.

the banner will be free on atomic shop on august 13

There's a Todd Build, you can mimic the time todd played Fo76, with his level 55 character...
---
i mean... this is our god, right?
---
Bwa ha ha I had pretty much the same reaction too. It‚Äôs the best display case.
---
RIGHT I did this mission and I had so much fun with it and thought the whole base was so cool (with the secret underground set up and the mission as a whole) but I have never seen anyone post about it.
---
Wait...we can recruit a Raider radio guy as a Camp follower.  Let's talk about the FO4 mechanic of assigning Companions to various settlements...
---
Imagine one person from OoM survived and decides to rebuild it and calls for everyone who completed the questline for help.
---
finally!
---
So that‚Äôs why I got downvoted for saying I don‚Äôt care for shopping at plan camps? OK, fair enough. I agree that people can do what they want with vendors, but they should accept what they do may generate less buyer traffic. My experience has been camps that go all in on plan vending have terrible prices and selection. So I see a camp with lots of plans and not much else, I shop elsewhere.
---
Omg!! Yes! Yes! Yes!!
---
^^^ This guy gets it.
---
I‚Äôd like to know when The Children of Atom are going to make an appearance.
---
Well, the Enclave was a "secret" organization inside the government.....if everyone knew about it, it wouldn't be a secret anymore.
---
Yea.. its very much a ‚Äúdamn kids, get off my lawn‚Äù emote
---
Yup, reminded myself it‚Äôs been too long since I‚Äôve watched it, now have I plans tonight after I finish up my dailies.
---
So you're saying the known method you specified is the Bethesda intended way of daily quest? Doing it every day?
---
Then why are you adding the "known for a while" to a glitch that you don't even know? I apologize for not specifying this is a glitch at the post, I'll do better at that.
---
Did you even read the full post before replying?
---
I never even knew there were rare bats, but I dressed Gramps up in a baseball outfit and rebuilt Moe Cronin's "Swatters" shop at my camp so I NEED THEM.
---
I feel for the guys that are actually donating all their junk when they're just messing around with the numbers like this lol
---
Oh I thought I just meant that that part was over
---
The steel fridge is better than the bloody Arktos one, but I'd rather get a nice clean white one. I want my kitchen to look nice, dangit! 
---
.
---
Surprised to see the Tanksgiving Display back so soon! Figured it'd be a big hit they'd save for this coming turkey day. Delbert Winters would want you to have it.
---
I can see if you are kicked out then making another one but to be afraid of being kicked out seems irrational. I have been kicked before and there is no negatives other than the 2 seconds to join another or make my own. People are making their own without attempting to join another and I look at their team every once in a while and it's still empty so it is not as if their friends are getting on. There are other reasons that I have seen people post on this thread though
---
They ain‚Äôt building nothing till the migos show up
---
‚ÄúWhile you‚Äôre reading this, Diseased Radrats are chewing on your legs. Enjoy!‚Äù
---
Well if someone was there I would‚Äôve left them but no one was and I even waited a little. But yeah  hopefully a low level finds yours. I still drop all the legendaries to low levels that I won‚Äôt use or that are low level. So if a low level finds it I‚Äôm sure they will think they hit the jackpot

In other breaking news: water is quickly becoming a great way to hydrate.

I find myself giving a hard pass to the new items every week in favor of grinding out for the Legendary Run items.  I had to cancel my 1st membership months ago because I have over 10,000 atomic points that I don‚Äôt seem to spend unless some cool old item makes its way back to the shop.
---
Apply for a job as a developer and fix VATS.
---
I'd like to return to the Pitt too, and all the other cool places in the Fallout 3 DLC as well. That'd be sick.
---
I've learned to just not follow Youtube metas. You can easily get your build rounded enough for DPS, carry weight, and being Nuclear Winter viable. Don't be a hoarder except for quality Junk items. Try and specialize into one weapon/ play style. This way you can focus on reducing weight for that ammo specifically, as well as a decent backpack mod. If you haven't beaten the Wastelanders questline yet I have top tier advice. Complete both Settlers, and Raider quests until the point of no return message pops up, side finally with the Raiders to assist with breaking in, and (here's the kicker) let the Raiders keep half the gold. You will beat the quest WITH friendly reputation and instantly be able to buy the Chemist backpack mod. There is no point in keeping all of the gold bullion, none, when you can't spend it on anything! If you need tips on maximizing Stash limits, daily limits, and build advice shoot me a DM. FO1st isn't a requirement, being level 500 bloodied build doesn't make you a better player, and being a slave to the limits doesn't have to be a hellscape. Cheers.
---
Same issue. Cannot advance quest. Fun.
---
Its sad to think they work so little on the game ending bugs and unstead fkcus on "fixing" bugs that make the game fun. I wish this was my first autocomplete issue, but it is my third instead.
---
That build is.. well.. very mediocre. Firstly lifegiver bug was fixed and there is no reason to take it anymore, using 5 points on demolition expert is a waste of perk points and a no no when 25% ffr is way better option for major effect, action girl/boy for ap regen when you are not using vats as a heavy gunner and you don't have dodgy is kinda silly, one gun army for bloodied build? Everything dies before you benefit from it. And Queen is immune to crippling. Also, SH Games is wrong about so many things about the game that it hurts my head when someone says he is great youtuber.
---
They‚Äôre missing out on good easy opportunities to appeal to the playerbase
---
fuck it, i mean, if you want to just toss in a few bucks, go for it. 
---
Play the game drunk, ignore others around you irl. 
---
This is your time. Also, yell at the sun when shit goes F. the sun is named Todd. 
---
Also use headphones so the other "life" is somewhat censored. 
---
oh, right Fo1st. i guess. It's just a helper with time consuming tedious scraping/bulking/selling, but no real benefit in game...
---
Fair enough, maybe I install a shortcut so I don't get nuked again XD
---
They rarely drop from enemies, always worth checking before scrapping :)
---
I would love them be added back, maybe some survivors do show up, as I don't think we have bodies for all names in the terminals, they could post a mission for rebuilding on the missions terminal thing to get everything started. Bethesda could make the manor an instanced interior which is player specific just like the other quest areas (foundation/crater/wayward) are and have you restore it, you could have recruiting mission, a radio show broadcast only available to those who did the quest line, technology acquisition ones similar to the ones that introduced you to the order, maybe have the computer come up with improvements, like get a "Deliverer" type pistol as an alternative to the revolver to drive home the assassin spy themes and finally get dailies which consist of taking down blood eagles and helping the common folk like scavengers or settlers maybe even the "soft" raiders of crater
---
I STILL use the Blade of Bastet. IMO it's the best (non-legendary) melee weapon in the game. I'd ki for more order of mysteries stuff.
---
And maybe a way to remake the Mistress of Mysteries dress? I scrapped mine forever ago and I want it back, but you can only make it once. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
&gt;boy they are ~~so desperately trying to~~ selling those ~~ugly~~ bad ass raider pa skins Xd
---
Fixed it for you.
---
the vats thing?
---
What is even up with this shite? Why does everyone sell 20 of each mounted plan? Im looking for plans i dont have and used to get excited when i see someone with 300 plans available. I get there and its 20 of each mounted and nothing else.
---
I would agree with you, but it‚Äôs a vast improvement over Rockstars approach which is absolutely zero communication.  You can scream at them for weeks and weeks and they will be stone silent the entire time and then weeks later release a fix or an update or whatever.  Often R* won‚Äôt even give a ‚Äúwe are aware of the problem‚Äù canned response.  You‚Äôd be better off yelling at an actual brick wall.
---
Bethesda at the very least; ineptitude aside, will communicate with us even if it isn‚Äôt what we were expecting or their idea will make things worse.  We know they are at least trying to not seem like a greedy gaming company out only for your money.
---
Those tires are so dope! The nest is gonna be so much fun to build with. 
---
I just get burnt seeing it costs $12 for 4 items and they have extras listed below... üòî
---
Well GTAV has been like that for years so I expected the same from RedDead. Never bought it, personally. I feel like Rockstar should have enough money and influence to get VAC security but whatever.
---
Bruh, 250 concrete they are SO HIGH. What are they building there? A great wall of B.S.is what I smell. I think they know they're junk market is destroyed, so let's tell everyone they'll get something free and watch the junk start flowing in. It partially fixes a mistake and goes along with a new group arriving. See "it just works" out guysüòÇüòÇüí•
---
not sure if you are trolling or just stupid.
---
I guess they figured that if every person in the active player base donated at least 1 time, we‚Äôd hit.. and then noticed that it wasn‚Äôt attainable
---
Yup :)
---
I've had team leaders kick me out of public groups upon joining before. I joined again, only to be removed again. 
---
Plus, sometimes someone is still "in" the group, but not showing up as in the group. For instance: you crash or have to dashboard your game without leaving the server. The game still sees you as being part of the group, but you won't appear in game. When you restart the game, you get the option "Play With Team" and it puts you right back in like you never left.
---
I don't know where the German accented robot idea comes from but as a German it amuses me and I never knew I wanted it. (I still play the game on English so I could actually enjoy the accent)
---
Thank you so much for the heads up!
---
I mean, I was logged out on another game today and came back to 0/2 Weekly and 0/6 Daily. Not super excited about it.
---
They will communicate, but it‚Äôs not enough to say they are good communicators. Comparing something bad to something worse doesn‚Äôt make it good
---
Not to be a nag, but would the preview (like when you're scrapping) show it being that color or would it show as plain wood until it's equipped/displayed? ü•∫
---
Where exactly does it say that concrete was failed on that? Because it's already been announced that banner is available on the 13th. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4yv87wiyzzymMG5VPuyLuE/atomic-shop-weekly-update-august-11-18
---
Hey thank you!!
---
That's what I love about it. it's basically a free spawn point that you can move for free. But what I really love is I can set up Workshops and not get suckered into PVP.
---
I remember seeing an AngryyTurtle youtube video on this, after testing he determined concentrated fire rank 1 gives 1% damage bonus, rank 2 is 2% bonus damage, and rank 3 is 3% bonus damage.  I just use rank 1 to have vats target limbs, and save the other points for something else.
---
no you literally just have to be in a team to get the full bonuses, even if no one is in the team with you
---
Yes, I have done a lot of drops on my private server last week and this week and have not had any trouble I just did not look until I hit o shit button but I can only blame myself got in a hurry cause of the clock and tried to speed things up.
---
No, I would advise you play the game, so to speak. The relatively low stash space makes you understand what is valuable, once you find a balance of scrap levels you can cruise through the game. Its a lot easier now as you can buy  backpack mods for 5-10k now, and they can be applied to any backpack. 
---
Once you have enjoyed the game and had your money out if it. Then pay for first, it changes the game so much. Allowing stupid weapon collections and easy access to trading for better gear.
---
(me at Walmart, wheels five carts filled with stuffing mix to check out)
---
Checkout Ma'am: "Sir, please, other families need Stove Top"
---
"I am THE STOVE TOP!"
---
(Laughs furiously as the checkout person scans each box)
---
I don‚Äôt think I disagree with you on that, but one thing that frustrates me with it is that it literally could just be a terminal. The machine itself doesn‚Äôt actually do anything.
---
I think stalker is one of the magic effects and if by crippling you‚Äôre talking about the limb damage effect then you definitely have a magic shotgun. I‚Äôm not gonna say it‚Äôs a good thing but for shotguns the magic damage is sort of an unofficial buff since shotguns are way underpowered for some reason. A good way to test though since I‚Äôm not sure about the vats damage perk since I don‚Äôt use it is craft a regular max lvl shotgun and see if you get the same results in vats as your stalkers shotty. The extra vats damage could be from stalkers as well if you sneak around so who knows may not be magic
---
‚ÄúWhat would you pay for that item in someone‚Äôs Vendor? Remember that when it‚Äôs time to sell something yourself.
---
I was JUST about to say this! I have the Raider Punk at my C.A.M.P.! He's always spouting off ridiculous nonsense about 'Gotta keep up my radio voice... you never know!'
---
It would be so neat to make a new radio station for him to read out new OoM stories, possibly based on activities WE do in the quests! WE could be the new Mistress (or Master!) of Mysteries!
---
Cool your jets, Chicken Little. Cork will be reduced and met, as expected.
---
No nag at all :) The color does show on preview, but I can't remember if the name shows the color :)
---
Definitely getting tired of this game.  I'm going to go to 100 this time b/c I hate leaving things unfinished but next season I probably won't even try.
---
It's really starting to bug me that this game is 10% content and 90% grind.
---
What do you mean ‚Äúeither‚Äù?
---
Will it take Fasnacht masks?
---
Did you try [yelling at a cloud?](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/019/304/old.jpg)
---
It does
---
Okay will be back with results
---
On the events page, it saw still showing locked so assumed we failed. Didn't see that other update.
---
We didn‚Äôt fail concrete. They haven‚Äôt updated that page. The atom shop page says we completed it. They lowered limit to 15m
---
You only need level 1. It doesn't up damage much at all unless you are aiming for headshots, or you have like a +50% limb damage and shoot those. 
---
As someone already stated level 3 has a very small percentage increase.
---
I think he‚Äôs talking about the story missions for online, not story mode. And no it‚Äôs not good, just a decent money maker to start you off
---
Sweet! Thanks for the quick confirm. Know what I‚Äôm doing after work.
---
Personally I think it‚Äôs worth it, great for having your own server so you can go places and not have someone already been and emptied the place. I normally only use private server then jump onto the public to sell the stuff I‚Äôve found/collected.
---
The tent makes a good place to fast travel too to save a few caps here and there or if you overweight you can bring it out and scrap your stuff/ put them in your stash box etc
---
With the atoms, they‚Äôre great if you fancy buying anything from the shop that can make your camp look better or weapons look better. It‚Äôs also good for levelling up on the legendary run, should you need too.
---
End of the day, trial a month out and see how you get on - just remember to cancel it if you don‚Äôt like it lol
---
2765th post about this
---
If i could donate smaller amounts,  i would. But i never have 250. I have 150. If we could donate in 50s or 100s i could chip in but i don't feel like logging into a private server and grinding out another 100 just for that
---
i do cloud bursting exercises, thanks to Lynn Cassidy, does that count?
---
But that‚Äôs just bloodied being bloodied, it essentially carries the gun to be good. Have any other effect (TS, AA) and it‚Äôs shit, might be ‚Äúdecent‚Äù with junkies though
---
That quest line was a waist
---
This makes me feel better. In that case, I'm almost certain I haven't scrapped one. Thanks for the info! Now I will be on the lookout for one of these.
---
Just let it happen
---
That is pretty cool! And there is an option as team leader to prevent new people joining right? If not you can just kick anyone that joins. I can see that. Probably going to get that mutation for myself then
---
There has to be something more, but most people reccomend to be completely logged out during the reset. Theres some, like you, who aren't even playing the game or have their pc/console turned off, and it still happens. Who knows. Its bethesda, amirite?
---
They fixed the webpage. It says 500 now instead of ~~500~~.
---
You need gold bars for that. Do you have some?
---
Fist starts with an F
---
is this outfit available now? or is it something no longer in the store..
---
They could have repurposed the breach and clear event to just have the motherlode get the resources wanted for the atlas project but slap a different name on it and make it much more frequent
---
You can be apathetic to something offensive and it still be offensive.
---
I hope you get lucky :)
---
I was planning on taking a break too, canceling fo1st and catching up with my real life. I am on the brink of hitting rank 79 and this has been very time consuming. It's better to walk away for a bit rather than getting caught up jn the next season
---
Yes. I know it‚Äôs a weekly offer.
---
It is the store right now for thankfully you can buy it without the bundle. It just came today
---
It's not a vending machine like the others - it's like the Punch Bowl.  You fill it with drinks and people can take them.
---
Are you using any source of HP regeneration (armor piece, mutation, timed buff from food/chems/others)? that's one of the main things that trigger the fast travel bug.
---
I used to have that bug everytime until I removed my healing factor mutation, after that never got the FT bug anymore.
---
yes, it's a weekly offer
---
Totally agree. I got a furious explosive drop from the queen and though I‚Äôd give it a shot. My word that reload time. Felt more ‚ÄòArthur!‚Äô than ‚ÄòArthur Morgan‚Äô.
---
The damage increase is only 1% per rank. The reason to use concentrated fire is the accuracy boost you get in vats.
---
waste**
---
You Responders are good people. ü•∞
---
MAX CORK!
---
(runs screaming into the street)
---
You‚Äôve been a big help. Thanks for stopping by.
---
I‚Äôm not home right now but I know there was one coming to the shop so I can‚Äôt wait to get off work and spend my atoms
---
It's so bad it has to be on purpose.  3 menus screens for each transaction, no exit button. Set amount limits for each transaction. If you want to sell 100, (at a 20 per limit) thats 5 transactions with three menus each. THEN you have to back up 15 times to get out.  If that's not purposeful, who ever designed it needs to GO!
---
NO...we can't take a chance...CLAP FOR TINKERBELL!!!!! LIVE TINKERBELL!!! LIVE!!!!
---
\#clapfortinkerbell
---
A  private server doesn't solve the problem. I tried several times in private servers and found the concrete hot spots empty. Which goes back to the entire point of my thread: there are times when there is little to no concrete on the map no matter what you do.
---
After the 2nd time it got boring fast. You can find Legendary gear faster than going through that questline.    
---
As far as a unique story and questline it is quite good.
---
Hah, nice try synth
---
I feel the same way about the Raider Waster Underarmor.
---
I shouldn't have to spend 1,200 Atoms for a tanktop.
---
i guessing it's because they see the event page doesn't have it unlocked while already been updated to Cork.
---
That's what I have in mine. Top tip: Go to the overseer's house for some nice kitchen items.
---
Lol also why do I keep getting down voted? Is there something I should do next time/ not do??
---
Make sure you check for traffic first.
---
Thanks, wanted to know because i got a .50 machine gun with explosive bullets and the berserker effect but i see that the explosive part is not worth it
---
Wait what?
---
Every time I join a server I need to re-equip the Class Freak card?! O_O
---
I've definitely not been doing this.
---
All sleeping and not knowing that im there, few feet away from them! :)  But it feels like that two shot handamde is all the problems...
---
[edit: CSS (Chinese Stealth Suit), the Fixer are your best bet, can add a StealthBoy MkIII for fun. Don't ever fire a shot, or do anything. Just sit there. it'll be stealthiest stealth ever.]
---
I'd buy it for you but I highly doubt you'll trust me with your account lmao.
---
Do all coolers/refrigerators have the same perk? This one says reduces spoilage by 50%.... I thought one said 90% and several have said does not stack with perk cards, but this one doesn‚Äôt say that.
---
I didnt think of that üòÖ üòÇ
---
Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve found much of those. But I have been getting a lot of spears recently.
---
If it's only for damage you're fine with rank 1.
---
If you use vats a lot with non automatic weapons you're gonna enjoy rank 3 as it gives you 20% hit chance instead of 10% from rank 1.
---
Scrapping pipe guns also gives cork. I don't know if you need Scrapper equipped or not to get it. And since they don't require cork to make you could make and break them.
---
The server hopping to re-trigger is a bug/exploit, it‚Äôs not how it was designed to be done. It‚Äôs also inconsistent, 
---
If your are PSA‚Äôing to advise people of this bug/exploit then fine, but what I also got from your post was ‚ÄúDid you know that you can farm Stings and Things to get Possum badges?‚Äù
---
To that the answer is, yes we did, have done for a very long time.
---
i see what you are saying, but mine get bought on the regular, and i still am missing some.
---
On the other hand you could have taken some and left some for the next person as well...
---
Hopefully we see more of this
---
What's the capacity?
---
it is still on concrete for me
---
"Finally" lol
---
Update: news drop came out still wasn't very good.
---
Yes! üòÜ
---
Could be. Like I said above, maybe the second shot isn't hitting.
---
pc? i've got a bloodied + faster swing super sledge in my vendor right  now :P
---
I'd appreciate it if they also had La Fantoma as a member.
---
This is perfect, thank you!
---
As a resident Herbivore in game, I can put to rest any concerns about said Brahmin. They had already met their demise in the great pasture in the sky after long lives of many Riding Shotguns &amp; Free Ranges. They had each written in their will that they wanted to be catapulted after their passing to prove that it wasn't only pigs that can fly.
---
This is such a creative idea. I love all the work you do.
---
It‚Äôs frustrating that durenego or whatever her name is rattles on about the OoM and theres no option to say I‚Äôm the current Mistress.
---
I‚Äôve been wearing the tattered dress all this time.
---
things
---
Six items.
---
Those meat sacks are a good idea, super mutants seem to collect a lot of animal parts.
---
6
---
I haven‚Äôt got a clue, just got it.... I‚Äôve seen them at player camps, and I believe it‚Äôs 6 things, someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong...
---
excellent! thanks for the reply.
---
The real modus
---
For what?
---
This post is a fail.
---
Great.
---
Honestly there‚Äôs really no downside to having people on your public team. Possible extra shared perks, free fast travel to their camps. Only one I‚Äôve encountered is some middle-aged chain smoking woman hacking up a lung in the mic. Had to mute her.
---
Just farm super mutants.
---
I'm betting they know how players would want it to work but they don't know how to do it. Creation Engine is so fucked up at this point after 20 years of bandaid fixes and updates that a small team of developers that are new at working with the dumpster fire engine don't know how to make it work. That is why we see simple af bugs in game for nearly 2 years, every patch breaking the game more and more, nothing working as intended, stuff missing from the patch even if it is posted in the patch notes etc etc the list would be several pages long.
---
BuT mElEe Is AlReAdY tOo OvErPoWeReD
---
Another great place to get them is Duncan And Duncan‚Äôs Robotics in Summersville. (That place you go to for The Wayward questline). 
---
I believe you can find all of the robots there, and it‚Äôs a relatively safe area. (Just watch for the turrets, those things are on crack).
---
same here. it's nice of Bethesda to make Tuesdays special for us :)
---
No, I was talking about the main game.  My point was RDO is an add on to an actual really good game.  I know that it's SORT of a stand alone product, but it wouldn't exist without RDR2, so it's not really an apt comparison.
---
Weekly
---
Mmmm, Super Mutant exp... Tastes like excellence.
---
what the fuck did i just read
---
No argument there. I just compare it to other bloodied pistols. And it's a beast with no perks.
---
Found a 3* enemy, fast traveled to a friend, did the follow me emote, ran over near the 3* enemy, fired my Junkie's minigun at it to tag it but I killed it instantly before my friend could land a hit. They were so pissed. Yeah, could've used the sorry "whoops" emote.
---
Ok.........
---
Aren‚Äôt they a part of the Enclave? I remember reading something about Enclave members being SS but can‚Äôt quite remember. It was definitely from one of the older Fallouts which I never played myself (1 and 2)
---
Should we turn in as little as possible so they reduce the number again? After reduced then turn it all in?
---
If I had a bobby bin for everyone of these threads I wouldn't be over encumbered.
---
Yes! Finally something especially made for us Canadians!
---
Is the scrap not in your stash?
---
I was burned out on Fallout 76 and went over to Rdo as they also have a season pass right now which is much more enjoyable to complete than in Fo76. Now I don't know what to do. RDO is LITERALLY unplayable right now.
---
All of them reduce spoilage by 50%, and don't stack with any perks.
---
Yas now if only they'll let us divorce our clients from the servers and play it totally offline where we can mod it to hell and back to our heart's content, with the caveat that characters used on such worlds cannot be used online ever again.
---
yea
---
Thanks. That solved it indeed
---
Monthly only - not weekly
---
Arnt they skin mods for the armors? That‚Äôs how it is for the PA (I‚Äôm a PA user)
---
didn't buy it but they fixed the website it now just says 500
---
I would also be fine with them adding both "fan the hammer" and "dual wielding" perks which are mutually exclusive but  would buff pistols in an interesting way "fan the hammer" would change the animation and shoot a lot faster at the cost of accuracy, I significant reload speed buff would also be nice for it (also to balance with dual wield) "dual wielding" would only "duplicate" your current pistol, so you can't have crazy combos which are essentially 6 star legendarys, this would in turn double fire rate and ammo capacity at the cost of slowed down reload speed (as it's awkward to reload with two guns in hand) both should work in vast as well.
---
Yeah. Tends to be when you get 1 you get them all (hasn't happened to me personally but I read about it pretty often XD)
---
Thanks. Also dammit
---
Wonder why so many people feel the need to post about it ? Hmmm, its as if it‚Äôs an integral part of the game isn‚Äôt working properly. 
---
What‚Äôs wrong with having to try multiple times to fast travel?
---
They're a skin. You don't craft the armour, you put it in an existing piece of amour
---
all
---
And you expected it to actually work when you bought it?
---
Ahh, oh well then :) thx for the info
---
How do you change emotes again?
---
~~you got 15k atoms!?~~
---
The questline was such an effort
---
Reduce all of the remaining challenges to 20m at most!
---
Sadly the way the game was built, it would be impossible for them to do that, however it was confirmed that we're getting similar mod support to fallout 4 on console
---
ok thanks
---
SBQ fights with low levels are so funny to me, there was a low level that was most likely new to the game and he didn't know what was going on and was talking on the mic the whole time. He kept on asking for things but I couldn't understand and everytime I tried giving him something he wouldn't see it but eventually he got too scared and said "I can do this right now I'm fast traveling away" and I felt so bad but at the same time I couldn't really do anything. It's funny to me now because they had more balls than I did at that low of a level lmao.
---
Outside of the Gauss Rifle, which has the charge mechanic, there aren't really any hard hitting energy-based rifles.  And the Gauss Rifle is completely impractical for someone who runs Commando.
---
Wth guess I got lucky then haha
---
Scrap kits scrap all junk on you and puts it in your stash. It doesn't stay on your character
---
They should be under the ‚Äúpaint‚Äù modifications for the respective armors when you‚Äôre at an armor workbench.
---
Risk and reassurance are two key considerations of the activities of science, engineering, invention, and technology‚Äîcollectively often referred to simply as ‚Äúscience‚Äù or ‚Äúscience and technology.‚Äù Whatever they are called, they play a critical role in modern civilization, being essential for the advancement of society and the protection of our quality of life. It is these human disciplines associated with discovery and design that help separate the good from the dangerous on the farm and in the factory, at home and at the office, and on battlefields and frontiers. While science and technology can be misused and become the source of ruin, we would be at even greater risk from tainted products and contagious diseases were it not for the benevolent use of what are among the achievements that make us most distinctly human. If science and technology are two- edged swords, they are also the essential weapons in detecting and managing everyday risk.
---
make leather armor-&gt; modify--&gt; ghillie paint -&gt; amy dance pants
---
Thanks for the tip. I mainly use sneak so alternatives are great btw does StealthBoy MkIII really make you harder to detect? I've only used it in pvp
---
The event page isn't a real-time tracker. Concrete is done for me and now the meter for Cork shows. I checked about 10 minutes ago. Considering all the cosmetics I'm disappointed.    
---
I'd rather seek more unique things and seeing more BoS things is a plus.
---
Assuming all of the pellets hit I would imagine the TSE would do more damage but they're notoriously inaccurate. Personally, I'd go with the QE.
---
So all your comments are based on the first sentence I said? All your clarifying are still standing your ground on how you already know that daily quests can give badges? Then I see no point in arguing further to someone just replied without reading the whole post.
---
6 Teddies... all ya' need to know! üêªüêªüêªüêªüêªüêª
---
I‚Äôm with you on that bro.
---
if we called cork "CowBell" people would furiously
---
They decided it was the perfect time to release it because of how awful and poorly thought-out this event is.

"Uses Pack Rat for efficiency"

"Gets killed by player or outside an event"

............damn
---
Great joke at least they want us to think so! It's about more then just not meeting the demand most people are straight not even doing the event because they dislike it of course bethesda doesn't want to have to admit this reality. Since this event started I've been seeing less people on then normal and barely anyone on my servers even visting the Atlas observatory to begin with.
---
Thanks, instant purchase, teddy bears watch over me.

I'd also take an anti material rifle \^\^

I'm on PS4, been playing for a half hour...3 disconnects and 2 game freezes. It just works!
---
And they‚Äôre for like 250 caps each... 
---
I‚Äôve almost stopped camp hopping for plans I don‚Äôt know... and then right when I almost quit, I find someone with one I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm one of the few vendors that don‚Äôt stock that crap but every other vendor I see that has 100+ plans, it‚Äôs 75%+ mounted.
---
Hey, I got a 68 year old chain smoker the other day, unmuted my mic to ask if he was ok, we Ended up chatting for a bit, pretty cool dude
---
They already "fixed" it. Fat chance they're gonna redo it again. Sadly.
---
QE Double-Barrel. TS is shit, and Pumps don't do as much damage compared to Double-Barrel. Use VATs.
---
Nah I figure go big or go home bro
---
I like the idea of rescue missions as well, like in Fallout 3 where you could save settlers from super mutants and if you do it stealthily you get a bonus or something. 
---
I agree about the manor too, have the odd Mistress running around maybe see them in the field? It just seems such a waste to me to have a whole new faction that has a lot of interest and do nothing with it.
---
It‚Äôs in greatest hits so I think it is on a weekly timer... I bought it so the red banner that says for how long went away, but the stuff next to it says 6 days
---
That‚Äôs skins for the deferent armor types. So if you have a marine armor or metal armor . You can apply it too that.
---
railguns are a kind of energy weapon and it#s the early brotherhood so they might have some more gunpowder based weaponry than they do later in the timeline, there is hope
---
&gt;This is a scam.
---
Yes, and I mean that in an IRL kinda-way not an in-game kinda way.
---
I don't group much but my own Stealth Sniper VATS does very well.    
---
All of my gear except for a backup shotgun is legendary but not all crazy insane damage. Most enemies have a ranged and melee attack so you're going to take a lot of damage, more wear on our gear, and use more healing and other items than the rest of us.    
---
IMO, every character should have a long range weapon like a Sniper Rifle to do as much damage before an enemy gets close. For melee you should have a shotgun for mid-range and then switch over to your melee weapon. I tried a melee only character and I didn't like it.
---
You on ps4 ? Also I wouldn‚Äôt trust anyone with my account
---
I was gonna suggest the cork one, lmao.
---
This is the 100 time the nuka girl outfit has came back... what about the outfits that never came back like the poodle skirt or the clean bomber jacket?
---
Makes me want to pull my hair out everytime. But yeah, there are a few players that have actual plans, but they are rare.
---
Wasn't that bed or a very similar version available for free during valentine's day?
---
No :)
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why I get excited about atom shop on Tuesday‚Äôs and I know we get a free im sorry emote. So that‚Äôs awesome but I have said my atoms being nothing for a while has interested me like the junk stuff. But this outfit I‚Äôm sure is awesome
---
Are you on Xbox? Can I buy the brotherhood jumpsuit?
---
Glad you got a positive experience out of it. In between hacks, she was yelling at some kids like Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire when he calls his wife on the phone pretending to be applicants. ‚ÄúGet back to your cage!‚Äù
---
Yep, new players will likely never get to experience 76 the way we were able to back then.
---
100% excited to be able to explore without a time limit
---
Which event did you do before returning to your camp?
---
Yeah it really is a waste and as far as I remember there were rescue missions in FO4 too that you could do sneakily but no particular bonus for that, it shouldn't be too hard to add and would diversify the dailys
---
K then I will probably just wait for it to return if it ever does
---
I am on PC unfortunately cause im trading that one
---
Ah yeah more spooky stuff!!!
---
I understand that, but griefers gonna grief, y'know?
---
I‚Äôm so glad that they added the public teams so I don‚Äôt have to waste caps traveling to camps anymore for some of this. Just gotta switch to different teams.
---
Me personally, I‚Äôm gonna throw my Fasnacht masks in there instead of behind them bulky glass rectangles!
---
I read the whole post, my first post was on the basis that you WASN‚ÄôT trying to explain/point out how to exploit a bug. 
---
If you notice, in my 2nd comment I point out that doing this quest multiple times a day is a bug/exploit.
---
EDIT to Add
---
Rule 8 - NO POSTING OR ENCOURAGING PIRATED MATERIAL OR GAME EXPLOITS
---
Now granted, in the history of Exploiting bugs, this is a minor one, but it is still an exploit.
---
I did both Uranium Fever and Scorched Earth
---
My main build right now is the fixer with the Chinese stealth suit. My agility is at 15, and I haven‚Äôt had any problems with sneak. Managed to kill a level 50 legendary scorch beast without even being detected too.
---
interesting. Ya I have every mutation and I'm wearing a full unyielding set with AP refresh.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the only difference between those is either a slight change in the pattern, like a heart moved to the other side, or the headboard a different shade.
---
Bug fixes aside, are we missing all that much?
---
This exact same bug happened to me using the white Captain Cosmos paint on Raider power armor with a tactical red headlamp.
---
Nice, About 30min now, almost home from work.
---
I have a quad non explosive pump that is so amazing when it hits in vats but it‚Äôs also labeled as a magic weapon
---
thanks for the snark. It was super helpful.
---
And just so you know I'm new to these forums and I have yet to see anyone post about it. So I didn't know.  
---
You're the best. Keep it up.
---
Ok thank you very much, I hope it will stay for 6 days, I left for holidays so I can't log until weekend, I really want that display
---
Ah a shame. Good luck!
---
How on earth did OP manage to get hold off \~15k Atoms? Thats freakin 150‚Ç¨ in bethesda currency... dear lord Todd have mercy.
---
Is there finally an atom glitch so i can afford some plushys too for once?!!? That would be dope! lol
---
Its the same fucking engine I dont buy that copout for one second. They've never even tried to hide the fact that 76 is basically 4 with a multiplayer mod haphazardly duct taped on and the netcode sure feels it from an end-user POV.
---
The only thing stopping them from letting us play it the way we wanted all along is they lose out on tons of delicious MTX money when they have to compete with the Nexus. That is it. They want to try to force us to buy Atoms through FOMO grinds and shit, and they cant do that if we can run the game totally offline. If we can run it offline there isnt anything stopping us from bypassing the Atom Shop with player.additem, or a Nexus mod of far higher quality that costs precisely bupkiss.
---
Exactly! It‚Äôs using stuff that‚Äôs already there and available and they could add a photo mission where you scout some blood eagles (I know most people hate it but if they can already do it why not add more)
---
Do you know which perk makes it magic?
---
The sense of emptiness, loneliness, and desolation that came with the lack of human NPCs. Really made it feel like we actually were the first people to return.
---
OK, if you say so... You should just read again the  3rd part of OP.
---
Its still asking about exp√©rience and frustration. not only about how the fight goes.
---
It‚Äôs the best display in the game imo! I hated that it was gated for seasonal release, but glad to see it pop up now for sure. Hope you get it!
---
That to, I'm not stopping at only one cabinet.
---
After yesterday‚Äôs shenanigans, there should be more screws in the game...
---
Honestly im just annoyed that I‚Äôm on holiday and of course the one thing i wanted comes back , Why couldn‚Äôt it be any other time ?!
---
Did you even read your own link?
---
The concept, yes.
---
Not the word.  The word is Native American and describes an aspect specifically from Native American religion.
---
You downvote this guy, and maybe he is trying to stir up trouble more than anything, but these are simply the facts.  They also placed great reverence in creatures like eagles, and to draw that parallel with the sadistic Blood Eagles and liken their sculpture to a "totem" probably wasn't the best way to put it.
---
Yeah, I don't know how they are going to manage to monetize upcoming seasons if that is their plan. I'm rank 55, and it is already grindy, and then you run the risk of this auto-complete bug screwing you out of score. I'll pay for a Fallout 1st once or twice a year if I'm playing this game religiously, but if the seasons become Pay to Play, I'll pass.. Personally my Season goal is to get the Raider Gas Mask... 
---
I do hear you about Bethe$da fixing bugs that affect them, or that personally benefit the players.. And then letting hinderance bugs fly under the radar.
---
Not sure but anecdotally I launched a nuke at Whitespring and arrived in time for it to land about 20 feet from me. All it did was knock me down but then I died after the 30 seconds counted down.
---
So go to YouTube watch angry turtles video on magic weapons. Being my shotgun has 50% limb damage it‚Äôs a magic so it does way more damage then supposed to but if you don‚Äôt have a magic shotgun half the time they‚Äôre junk. Before I saw his video I probably scrapped so many magic shotguns but didn‚Äôt know about it
---
The biggest issue I've had with the prefabs atm is I cannot get them to place on foundation.
---
I went to donate concrete since I bought some bulk to clear the vendor caps. I was equally irritated when I found out the required minimum was so high.
---
I noticed that on my last move, but I still had to set the prices on some of them.
---
I genuinely have no idea.  The name "Madame Blitzkrieg" bubbled up when I was brainstorming.  :-)
---
I really don't mind the photo missions as long as I can fast travel directly to or close to them if they are a daily, I hate that camp spot near crater davenport sends you to, always need to mountain-goat there.
---
I would like those missions to have a requirement where the blood eagles need to be alive tho, for the thrill and for the sake of it being scouting instead of clearing
---
Sucks for sure, but I think you‚Äôll be good until next Tuesday though, so there‚Äôs that! It‚Äôs also at a really good atoms price which is surprising also.
---
I'm saying that wearing it during PvP isn't going to do shit for them. Of course it's the best PA for farming runs.
---
Did a private swap last night, all good. But I definitely feel for op. That sucks
---
Let me know... I'll buy it too in that case lol
---
I don‚Äôt disagree with this sentiment with any and all of the donations, but if you want to get to the 250 just google ‚ÄúFO76 where to farm‚Äù and there are several locations that have an abundance of golf balls that you can breakdown and easily get your cork.  Sadly the rewards seem very underwhelming anyways and I‚Äôm a new player so it‚Äôs not like I already have a lot of the potential ‚Äúgood‚Äù rewards, I do however have very little inventory space for tons of garbage like alcohol.
---
*edit* The double SCORE and half price legendary Purveyor community rewards are good though - at least for me.  So hopefully we hit those.
---
Sadly i come back very late next Tuesday so im gonna miss it
---
Limb damage, bash damage and 33% vats hit chance for shotguns.
---
.......Fist you?
---
.\_.
---
Bloodied unarmed melee all the way. When I buff up with food and chems I hit the queen for about 11,500 dmg per hit in the face.
---
Sigh.  Fair enough.  I want a vendor that doesn't look ridiculous.  Will review videos on clipping vendors into other objects.
---
whatever floats your boat dude
---
I have 5 characters and what i did was choosing 1 for the Season, it was fun and made me miss my other characters, i might choose 2 for the next one :P
---
Yea like taking the gold should have absolutely killed your reputation but it badly does anything
---
I‚Äôve decided to just drop my scrap on top of the donation box near the spawnpoint there. That way, hopefully another player can gain enough to donate it.
---
no1curr
---
don't worry it will be changed at the last minute
---
Chonky boi
---
Dang, I didn‚Äôt realize. I replied to someone else saying they were out on holiday, and was gonna be back for the weekend... thought it was you at first. Pull some strings, get a buddy to log in as you, lol.
---
I tried to use it (v2)and it sucked. Just dropped the junk ammo I don‚Äôt use

---
Have you played any of the previous Fallout games?    
---
Fallout is meant to be played offline and solo. I don't like the look and feel of 1 and 2 and started with 3. I have 3 and newer and this online thing still has mixed feelings for me. The new content is the only thing that adds new content where the previous ones never got anything new. They all have their DLC but if you do everything then unless  your on PC like me then there's not much point in playing.    
---
I haven't played ESO as I'm not a big fan of MMOs.
---
Use? No. But I have bought cheap radium rifles to scrap since getting mods for that thing is like pulling teeth.
---
TSE shotguns aren't worth using anymore in my opinion. Shotguns already break too fast and have enough accuracy issues without TSE problems. QE double is the way to go. Faster reload, better accuracy, better durability and faster fire rate.
---
Funny how I see this post when I finally decided to do my OoM quest today
---
Banjo
---
i am still scratching my head on why a toll route is a 9 minute longer drive than a standard route. where i'm from the toll route is almost always at least 10 minutes faster and that does not matter on routing
---
Dropped at uranium. U get the lot as a bundle. Like .02% drop chance. Jammy sausage
---
The emote this game so desperately needed
---
All my friends are either on holiday or don‚Äôt play ps4 so I literally have no hope of getting it
---
I completely forgot I had like 2000 billion on my rifle build. Absolutely nothing to use it on other than SS and I don't want it
---
[edit: for reference, google "Todd Bethesda"]
---
That is great - thanks everyone.
---
Make more sense for a bunch of PA love
---
It might be random because last weekend I tested it by joining a server and checking out Marsupial giving me -4 to INT. When I re-equipped Class Freak it went down to -1.
---
Now that I joined a server it was giving the intended -1 without re-equipping, so either they fixed it or it's random :-) Might want to keep an eye out for that.
---
I'd rather go for something like "Madame Steinhart" or "Madame Eiskalt" or essentially any German word that could sound like a name to someone non-German but that's mainly because that's always good for a chuckle and I wouldn't feel comfortable with "Blitzkrieg" given its meaning for history
---
I am Nukashine
---
But I am glad you can get 2k atoms just by reaching rank 100. Final 10 ranks are already paid, so no point grinding anymore.
---
Yeah, happened to me when I went to help with a defense. Had no idea what was going on at the time. Thankfully I got out and didn't die.
---
200mill?  Yeah. Nah
---
It was Uranium Fever, when you hit that less than 1 in 1000, you receive everything.  Congratulations, you are now in the 1/10th of 1%.
---
The Zetans are waiting for your high score
---
Ojnab
---
It's a primary route into Washington DC, arguably the worst traffic in the United States.  The toll is for the fast lane, and at this time the morning commute was peaked.
---
I have 3 and the other 2 are just lvl 5. But it's a pain playing all 3.
---
Ah mines actually got better since the update lol. It‚Äôs still happening but about 50% less.
---
For the record, it holds 10 items per fridge. You can build 10 fridges.
---
I was wondering about that one too, can't recall seeing a nuka vendor before
---
While I feel like the addition of NPCs was a smart move for the future of 76...
---
The original experience often felt lonely, and desolate (in a way I quite enjoyed).
---
It gave you a real feeling of being the only one out there. Uncovering stories of what happened to people and groups.
---
Don‚Äôt get first, don‚Äôt worry about it, don‚Äôt give Todd more money :)
---
The main quest could have been interesting to actually play through when all the factions were alive. But no its just boring
---
Bethesda needs to make an events where we donate purified water and bonesaws to Foundation, 300million bonesaws and 150trillion water should do it I think? We have 3 days
---
Everything is ravioli.
---
The writing in this game isn't impressive. I'm fine with them skipping it for the most part.  If they had compelling characters or storylines, I'd want more of it, but the Wastelanders update isn't writing I want more of.
---
There are some great visual stories, like the strange teddy bear scenes and Fort Defiance, but survivor stories on holotapes and (especially) the npc dialogues from WL are meh to nonsensical.
---
IGN means 'in game name.
---
radenn
---
I THINK I learned this a week ago while messing around. It makes no damn sense.  A group was attacking my bro and I could do absolutely nothing to help. Except impotently shoot at them only to invite my own swift death. And after I died, still couldn't hurt them, and they just kept killing.  Each time I died, the PvP was reset and I couldn't harm them until they started shooting me. Why cant PvP be automatic in a PVP zone? Why are we punished for getting the jump on someone?
---
Take a look at this note: ['Lewisburg Ambush'](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lewisburg_ambush)  found during the 'Pleasant Valley Infiltration' mission.
---
I'm annoyed they haven't reset the goal to 15m like they did with concrete. Im not worried about any of the other materials but cork needs to be lowered as well.
---
Thanks for confirming. Tend to get a lot of people who take the advice given in the community and state...
---
*the patch notes say this can't happen anymore so this is false*
---
Do you think Commander Daguerre would finally stop talking about ‚Äú...floating in space...‚Äù then?
---
So apparently you don't need the latest version to play online on pc anyway but I'm sure they fixed that
---
Okay, those are better.
---
Thank you for reminding me, hadn't considered those connotations.
---
Cries in both
---
I am in the middle of this quest for the first time. I am stuck at getting the sword as I am 33rd Level and everytime I go to the whitespire I get eaten by a Level 62 Glowing piece of shit ghoul. I will get there eventually but it is frustrating because I love this quest!!!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i7vkf5/take_it_we_failed_then/g14bxs2/
---
I'd just love a way to get the sword and gun back, without a second character.
---
That‚Äôs pretty neat! Just wish it would preserve longer and could hold other food items as well. 
---
Good/great with salt (whatever the name is) works great for me)
---
Oh damn didn't even know they dropped as bundles, thanks for the info
---
How much agility do you have.
---
Some of it has great potential though, the ‚Äúorder of mysteries‚Äù quest line is absolutely fantastic in my opinion.
---
The limit isn't higher because of people with millions of junk.
---
I'm waiting till everyone sells or drops their so I can put my horde up for sale. Did the same with my Faschnact loot and it's selling like hotcakes.
---
This was what I found

---
Don‚Äôt worry about the defenders in this sub, you can‚Äôt avoid them. If this is the 2765th post about this subject then even more reason to post it. 
---
It‚Äôs a completely valid point and post, it‚Äôs actually sad how people try to shut you down, the more posts the better, people pay for this shit.
---
The Almighty Todd.
---
My Gma will be happy about this. She feels so bad if she kills a legendary before everyone can whack it
---
This weird choice on how it works does seem to lean to favour the attacker but can backfire if the attacker isn't as strong as they think. 
---
My best guess is because ransoms can hold your claim from going through. 
---
Basically this also might work even if your not on the owners team but present during the attack.
---
Patch notes also said the SS limbs deep pocket mod plans are now available.
---
I don‚Äôt even know that, that‚Äôs pretty cool
---
Tone deaf. And they will change it, if they haven't already.
---
No sure about damage, but the QE double barrel is just fun gun to cruise around with
---
I sell Ultracite Plans for 150 a pop, no matter the part. Had a dude come by and buy a whole set of power armor and heart emote me for days. Some things sell when priced appropriately and can make someone's day.
---
It's fine, you can't think of everything constantly, no hard feelings!
---
It's not that difficult if you're a Fallout 1st member and are picky about what you buy.
---
No they were originally gonna have it in the bundle but then took it out to use at a FO1ST / SCORE reward.
---
Totally agree that it's silly that we can hold food longer on us than in a fridge.
---
Melee is so strong that it's kinda silly to devote all those special points to a pure melee build.
---
Three points in strength for martial artist or incisor. Thats all you need to include melee in your build.
---
I'm starting to put my trust in how the game works with community more and more everyday rather than the patch notes purely for one fact
---
They play it regularly
---
Pretty sure because all members have died, and the way the lore goes it seems like it was the leaders almost comic book fantasy of having a group of femme fatales. At least the BoS is made up of mostly ex military and they are still around and thriving, unlike the OoM.
---
So Player A attacks the players b and C but, not as Player A as Player C and then it sends them Skewing off into an alternate reality where Player A is actually Player C but Player B starts to fade out while playing "Earth Angel" on the Violent Nightstage, but that doesn't matter as then muthafuckin Player B turns into Super Mutant Biff  shows up just in time for Player A, who is now C, to knockout Super Mutant Biff who was Player B the whole time and (Todd Face time phase)
---
It‚Äôs only fast travel if it works the first time.
---
Bojan
---
Sure why not...
---
Use only 1 rank
---
Most of the people hoarding that much junk aren't going to be turning it in.
---
So many people were hurting to see NPCs in 76.... And for the direction of 76 it makes sense. 
---
I however do very much miss the original experience. It was so lonely and desolate. You wandered and explored 76's little stories, and really felt like you were the only one left. 
---
It was a really unique experience. I really enjoyed it. A lot of people need quests and stories told to them via NPCs, through exposition. 
---
I don't. I like when a game gives you a unique experience and can really hammer home a feeling of experience, and I feel like sadly, that was lost with Wastelanders (which I get. Rebuild the wasteland and all that)
---
I have to admit, that the Order of Mysteries was easily the most compelling storyline in the vanilla game. And though I guessed the ending pretty early on I had to see it through to the end. And even then, listening to that last holotape was like a punch to the gut. Serious kudos to the writer of that story.
---
As an aside, when I had Sofia as my Ally I gave her the Mistress of Mystery costume to wear, she was a fan of the series so I figured, why not? Sadly Bethesda didn't include any sort of dialogue from her about the possibility of players doing that. Oh, well.
---
all this over some flux
---
They are spread out through the house. Unless someone else already grabbed them.
---
alright thanks
---
but theres one problem, how do i gather enough ammo
---
Yea pretty much.
---
i turned my vaccuum on and yelled into it. it sucked
---
I've got that but instead of opening a doc and searching that was consolidating things for this one item we need.
---
I'd love to buy mothman or robot dance emotes, but they're not in the shop - and if they were I'd think they'd be in a bundle...
---
Can't even play rd2 online because it keeps saying a fault on rockstars and lol for 3 months
---
IMO game needs at least fix weapons/armor bugs first before adding new ones. We have enogh broken/unproperly working stuff atm.

Thanks for the report we will look into this.

This sir is pure genius.  And for every 1000 water you get a special loot bucket with Halloween candy and mount plans.
---
The NPC‚Äôs I don‚Äôt bother talking to, but the order of mysteries, some of the viewpoints on the early creation of the factions, is very interesting in my opinion. The obvious attitude towards ghouls and whatnot. Though it is interesting all the best characters are dead!
---
Patch notes are a great place to start but they're not The Infallible Word of Todd. Once you have observational evidence that contradicts it you start looking. Especially on something as easy to test as this.
---
Tree shit
---
Yes but I mean more reliable
---
do it
---
I don't have any perks equipped for it, but last I checked I have a bloodied broadsider that does 1,001 dmg per shot.

Thanks for the concrete evidence.

They could‚Äôve just kicked you out to find a water chip :p

if you have a friend with 1st , or you are the first person on a server to turn it in it will work...so if you dont have a friend with first server hop a few times until you find a server where no one else has done this quest yet
---
edit: i think they did test it but since they were they first person on the server to turn it in it worked fine for the tester
---
Aww jeez

Can't wait for this to MAYBE be patched in next months update.

A good game developer would hotfix this shit real quick, it's the main storyline ffs.

The rewards were trash, so bad that it really was a donation. One the actually cost you money and not worth the fast travel fee. The materials are dumb, the goal amounts are crazy, and the 250 minimum to contribute is assanine. I hope we don't make the goals just to show how shit it is. Treasure hunter had some combat and some fun

Fucking, when I worked at Marine World out in Vallejo CA we had two killer whales there; Yakka and Vigga. Now Yakka, she was a good girl, she'd just swim around doing her little whale in captivity thing. Vigga though, she had problems. All day long she'd just go on and on about the atomic shop. And this was 30 years ago, before there even was an atomic shop. 
---
As soon as I'd get to work in the morning there she'd be, waiting. "Eeeee eeeee 'click' 'click' eeeeeeee" she'd say to me as I approached the tank.  "I don't even know what the hell a grognak bundle is!" I'd reply, wishing just once she'd ask about my morning or how my weekend was.

science and science expert are different perks. having a rank 2 in science counts for rank 1, but just having science expert does not.
---
we have a level up challenge every day. just choose the basic science perk.

With a Fixer, 3000 point headshots are pretty normal. With a handful of consumable buffs, 500+ point headshots on SBQ is typical

Pipe revolvers don‚Äôt have any cork, just the 38‚Äôs

Yea we all know it isn‚Äôt an atom shop change the atom shop already has combat rifle skins. Bethesda is already looking into making them applicable on the fixer but that has zero relevance to this post lmao
---
Yes exactly because it just works!
---
Jealous! I‚Äôve been wanting them for ages that I even had a dream last night that I finally got them as a reward ahahaha

The problem I always had with the constant demand for NPCs is, besides not fitting the story, there WERE NPCs in the game. They just weren't human.

You mean the plain version of the Chinese assault rifle, the non-green version?? Because me fucking too, it‚Äôs what makes me want to check the atom shop every Tuesday. I need it
---
I don't even know what needs cork to be crafted. But a character I have played for a little over a year now only has like 300 cork in my scrap box. I really don't think this is going to be any more feasible than the concrete goal.
---
I think it has a lot to do with the usefulness and availability of the resource. People had a lot of steel because it is everywhere and in almost everything you can pick up to scrap. Concrete is common enough but if you build camps a lot, you are potentially using it a lot for foundations. Cork, has such minimal usage that very few are actively looking for it outside of this event, so not many are going to have a lot of it stored up.
---
But I have 8 Teds.
---
you mean "change," not "fix."
---
This was definitely the best quest line in the game, felt like a proper fallout quest with excellent lore and storytelling. The ending was hauntingly beautiful and made me extremely sad when I saw them together at the end
---
Have you tried doing meeting one of the challenge requirements, anyway, to confirm you wont get the score?
---
Tbh the OOM quest line was boring and bland. That quest line was the most boring one second to Recruitment blues with the goddamn DMV. Also having that veil of mysteries in my inventory because it was an essential item really annoyed me.
---
"A Gold Plated .50 Cal Rifle Skin"

bruh are you telling me that typo was in there all these times the bundle came out and I just noticed
---
Would be nice to get a lunchbox for each 1000 score over.

But remember this is part of them taking away our access to earning atoms.  If we end up paying all the atoms we earn in the pass just to complete the pass it's just a shafting.

Okay, cool. Thanks for this. I haven't had the chance to personally test which of the (3?) pipe guns gave cork.
---
Duped? I sell each part for 150 (they're worth 500) and I've earned all those stacks legit from doing the SBQ. Am I supposed to drop them for free for you? They're already discounted out the ass. Don't assume because I have a lot of something I'm a duper. It's insulting to people who play this game legitimately.
---
&gt;no

"science perk" is no the same as "science expert perk". There are 3 different science related perks, normal one, expert and master and each one have different bonus and their own card ranks.

I ran into this problem just the other day with a new character.  I tried switching servers, but that didn't work.  When I logged back in a day or so later with that character, it let me complete the mission like normal.  Maybe a full log out and log in will help?

THIS. It's such a disappointment that there is so little content. I really hope this changes because screw the BOS. Lore wise, I am so salty about their upcoming involvement in the story and that we're going to be forced to grind for them to further the story.
---
WE NEED ORDER OF THE MYSTERIES CONTENT!
---
It changes, but usually once something goes for a certain discount it will not be sold at a lower discount again. The basic PA paints for example used to go for 30% off a few times, but then they went 50% off a feature or two ago (they come back under best sellers literally every month lol) and now it seems it is always 50%

It's a waste of a nuke if you don't time it right since you can't kill the queen with a nuke and it won't spawn another. Unless your goal is to try and nuke people.
---
Considering they don't seem to be slowing down to do that, I'm just making suggestions to try and make the most out of what they ARE doing.
---
If you haven't played the actual 'main game', then more fool you mate. It's an absolute peach...beautiful in every way.
---
Online ? No comment. I'd imagine for all the grief it gets FO76 is far better in that respect. The single player RDR2 is one of the best computer games I've played hands down, across all platforms.
---
I fill my camp with plans because as the opposite player, I go to different camps to collect them, and if they have a shitload, I go straight there. If you have no plans, I assume you just have some overpriced or underleveled gear sitting in a store. Not worth the travel caps.

i bet we'll do out best and still not reach it and they'll lessen the goal again.

As for weapons that can be realistically used, a Lever Action rifle.

If I had to guess the likeliest of reasons it uses an interface isn't because of immersion, but as an anti-duping measure.
---
The lack of a hopper to dump or retrieve ammo in favor of having everything just sent and removed directly from your inventory alongside the slower console interface means that the system wouldn't be vulnerable to the usual quick swapping container and lag based duping methods.

Also, I missed a SBQ raid because I was stuck in the menu for 2 minutes trying to figure out how to escape (hold B, who fucking knew)

We at the Order of Mysteries do our best work hidden in the shadows, unlike those boisterous boyscouts in the Brotherhood of Steel.
---
Seriously though, I wish there was more out there to decorate our camps, or something relating to the quest line in the game.
---
That's still a tad disingenuous though because I have stacks of those as well because you also get them from the SBQ. You can't just go around assuming everything is duped when there's people who play this game a shit-ton and get many legit drops that you can only use once. I'm not gonna just throw them away when I see how much others sell them for. I'm not saying there isn't duped shit, I'm just saying, I've done the SBQ so many times I have stacks of everything she drops for days.

This.  I saw it was on cork. But that the BoS banner was locked as if it wasn't achieved.

I assume this wouldn‚Äôt be scalable as the count shown in the minimap is an index value that is common to all players in the server, whereas known plan count would be unique per user.

The hardest hitting single-shot ones are "The Dragon" (225 base dmg) easily taking top spot, followed by the "Black powder Rifle" (180 base dmg) and "Gauss rifle" (140 base dmg) for their respective highest level versions, though I recommend the Black powder rifle for one-shotting if you can get your hands on an instigating or bloodied version because The Dragon can't be a legendary (apart from legacy versions and very very rare one stars from the candy turn in at watoga highschool)

Carrying over decisions from one set of content to the next to the next snowballs to much if you actually try to do anything meaningful with it.  The best you should ever expect of it is maybe some throwaway dialogue at some point where it doesn't matter either way who you "sided" with. It's a waste of time and resources otherwise to come up with different quests and story progression for if you sided with the raiders or settlers when they can just make a standalone story for the BoS, especially if there isn't even a requirement to do any of the wastelanders content int he first place and new players can just head straight to the BoS.

What

As far as useful weapons go bloodied lever action and gatling guns do well for single shot damage. Instigating is quite good for regular mobs. If you want to spend a bunch of perk points the bolt action pipe rifle and pipe revolver double dip with gunslinger and rifleman perks. With the right perks and sneak bonuses I've hit for 3k plus pretty regularly. Sneak attack modifiers are the way to go for big damage numbers.

Maybe I'd bother if 250 of them weren't required lol.
---
The orbital strikes and supply drops may be difficult to track back to the Enclave, but the military robots with the big ‚ÄúE‚Äù on their chest are a different matter. Those are the ones most likely to spark a confrontation.
---
The Enclave being hidden while the BoS is out in the open simply gives the former a tactical advantage.
---
Still, that wouldn‚Äôt prevent the BoS from trying to figure out which group in Appalachia is currently playing with all the hi-tech toys, and more importantly, looking for them in order to appropriate their tech, so that it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmisused‚Äù.
---
Also the high school gym has some baseballs and golf balls, too.
---
YES! The duffel bag is a fantastic loot drop bag. It's easy to spot amongst grass and debris. If it wasn't for the terrible interaction box, it would have been absolutely perfect. Whoever came up with it had a great idea. It looks like they may have simply reskinned the paper bag and just forgot to change the dimensions of the interactable area.
---
Go on a trading sub then tf??

just for you

This is one Wasteland family with a vacancy I‚Äôd have been able to support. If Bethesda didn‚Äôt wipe my entire account. *sighs*
---
Oh well. It‚Äôs not like I was gonna play anymore anyway. I only got on to mass dupe B2525 fixers and legacies for the people who *still* couldn‚Äôt get their hands on one despite the state of the market. For caps too.
---
I lost 6250 score today. :/
---
Probably a visual glitch. Try changing servers or restarting the game. There are 8 weekly challenges: [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html?](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html?)
---
FFS its not the reason why i said you cant compare....
---
The question asked by the OP wasnt about the mechanics by themselves, but about player exp√©rience and frustration. I dont care about what People answered, mechanics are not the question here.
---
And in that d√©partement you clearly cant compare a single player game and a MMO, where other players can ryin your experience and influence mobs behavior
---
Whats so special about it? Does it display items differently to the other cases?
---
I can‚Äôt even be bothered with 2 characters 90% of the time.. all the god damn scorchbeast Queens being spawned.. üòí
---
I'm quite alright here, thanks.
---
Helping new players is one of my fav things to do
---
Nope. There are a couple other skins for it.
---
Her\* and buy. I guess I'll delete the post in a sec
---
Yes. This, is in fact, the correct answer.
---
Not ture I've been on during reset many times and didn't get the bug and have had days when I waited till an hr or more past it but still auto completed, But I really dont give an f any more cuz I'm finished WOOT WOOT
---
Same, and looking forward to seeing your camp!
---
OK Todd
---
Anyone figure out how much camp budget the metal eagle sculpture takes up? If it uses a bunch like the neon billboards, then it simply isn't worth it.
---
I'll just be sitting on my front porch doing the fist shake emote at all you unruly kids if you need me.
---
...yeah.
---
Thank you üòä I love the helmet
---
Your friend is wrong.
---
To be rid of a bounty, someone must kill you.
---
Although I wouldn't mind it getting more attention I really didn't find it that enjoyable after a while
---
Dang, I always miss these things...
---
There is no Todd, only Zuul.
---
There's a theory that being the first person on a server to try to complete it will allow it to work. You'll have to get lucky on a public world unless you have access to a private one which seems to work.
---
Ikr?! Like why does no one ever talk about how the actress who plays the Mistress of Mystery just happened to live in West Virginia and literally started her own faction of real life mistresses after the war? We even get to see her &gt;!dead body!&lt; 
---
After completing the mission, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder where the other Unstoppables! resided and what happened to them after the war
---
I liked the order of mysteries. Im not going to lie but when wastelanders came out, I was hoping for an npc to be at the manor with special dialogue. I think the military base got special dialogue.
---
The scrip limit is 150 per day.
---
Your last straw needs to be something else.
---
I legit went around and bought concrete off every vendor for the stupid brotherhood.  All I know is a better be a member since I already went thru their quest line.
---
I think the bolt action .50 cal hits harder if thats your criteria.
---
Lol @150 scrip limit a week. Also you're nowhere near the "endgame" if you're level 50 and haven't figured that part out yet.
---
Yeah, I really hope we don't get Fallout 4's genocidal fascist version.
---
I'm on Xbone. But I appreciate the suggestion.
---
The banner is unlocked. Try refreshing the page or closing that tab and revisiting it.
---
Someone placed their Fallout 1st Tent just outside of the brick wall that surrounds the event area. It forces all scortched to spawn as a pile right there...I really wish people would quit 1 shotting everything at these events.
---
You‚Äôre welcome.
---
Welp, that's unacceptable.  I would pay a fine but anyone who kills me will have to take my life as I fight back with all I am worth.  I guess I am a career criminal.
---
Yea this isn‚Äôt some post apocalyptic wasteland where conflicts would naturally arise between people, it‚Äôs all about collecting different stuffed animals and taking selfies....
---
If you check it out, most of the crates are in front of the house in the fire. There is a large crate along with two smaller crates behind (north) of the house.
---
These Secret Service are not Enclave. The Enclave ones are aboard the oilrig.
---
I totally get why they keep bringing the nuka girl outfit back. It's probably a top top seller and they want to keep exposing it to new players. I just wish they would keep a larger atom shop inventory going at all times but they know FOMO is the best motivation to move their product.
---
Where is best place for this?  I park my CAMP by the group in the Gad lake bed and I seem to get mostly the rifles from them.  I‚Äôm not a max level if that matters.  Thanks!
---
Turn in like 2.5M then stockpile untill they change it.
---
Well, yea but, I just assumed, 6 of one
---
Yes, yes he is indeed a chonktonkiclus
---
It‚Äôs only an underarmor, but you can get a version that has armor ontop of it.
---
I'd love to see a full faction war once every body returns but you have a point.
---
Not all the Enclave were on the oil rig...the lore talks about Enclave groups scattered across the globe.
---
(Shakes jello mold)
---
Maybe not wood and cloth, they are pretty easy to mass hoard but the other ones...Yeah pretty much
---
Your friend is proof that level doesn‚Äôt mean much in this game. 
---
You aren‚Äôt ‚Äògriefing‚Äô anyone just by stealing some water. You get Wanted and then get killed. That‚Äôs part of the game. 
---
Griefing is a while different ballgame.
---
No they are not. These SS are prewar remnants. The Enclave SS from Fallout 2 should be on the oilrig now.
---
as opposed to public blood
---
Hey all, I know this one is frustrating since it's blocking your progression. We're actively working to address it as soon as we can so that you can get back to the main quest. 
---
A fix is in progress, but it isn't ready for release yet. I'll give you a heads up as soon as I hear an update on the status of that fix.
---
Father Face
---
Would you like to speak to the manager?

CHALLY IS MOO MOO

You mean the well-known Line in the Sand glitch that we've been using for weeks?

No, I don't think it's happened before.

Dual wield SHOULD exist. Like, don't give me extra speed, just the possibility of using a pair and having 12 shots at my disposal. In fact, you could give a penalty to my accuracy and it would be fine too.
---
I have a bunch of them in my machine for 10 caps, and I still see lots of newer players buying them, probably because they see other idiots selling them at 150 and think they're getting a deal.
---
This is heavy
---
Speed loaders would also be a nice addition for the revolvers, being able to craft ammo in the form of speedloaders for a few additional steel per unit.
---
don't worry, we will be able to whip 'em out soon enough.
---
Keep increasing your bounty and eventually someone will come along.  More fun for you.  Quite often that someone will melt your face off before you can blink, but that‚Äôs the nature of the game.
---
Right here
---
lol yes if you notice no one else in the video seemed surprised by it
---
Yes, I love those tapes.
---
True. I am talking about the Enclave Secret Service protecting the Enclave president.

If you scan the area with your camera it will appear in the top corner of your screen it enters your field of view
---
I'd rather have 3 points of Good with Salt so that all my great food buffs, with talents and perks and in with the group buff is easier to maintain.  There are too many OP guns out there to worry too much about 15% bonus damage.
---
What a weird post
---
GrAH-PEH!
---
West Tek, Huntersville, The Generals Steakhouse, and Bog Town all have a decent amount of Super Mutants. Harper's Ferry can spawn them as well but it's a variable spawn so you might get ghouls and scorched. These areas might be a challenge though depending on your build since you aren't max level.
---
Pylons=electric(energy) The imposter lays down a blanket of fire=burning.
---
Achieved victory.
---
It's been happening to me on xbox for weeks now
---
... maybe...
---
Good old Frank Horrigan....yeah, definitely not that Secret Service.
---
[edit: wee]
---
It‚Äôs not bad manners, it‚Äôs just extremely uncommon. When the game launched pvp was a much more common occurrence. Every server you joined had several people on the map with bounties and your base would have to be locked up right with good turret placement etc. As the game started to slow down player wise people who liked pvp moved to different games and most of the people left playing to this day are (mostly) more interested in pve/cosmetic content. 
---
So you can def play that way, but for the most part there‚Äôs very little incentive to do so and most people won‚Äôt really engage in it themselves
---
Shut the door on your way out please üòÜ
---
.... gnomes...
---
The terrain plus explosions always makes this a tough body to find?
---
all that is
---
i had tried with and without the grounded mutation, it does show ~~weapon~~ energy damage ~~-13%~~ \-12% but doesn't seem to be noticeable or maybe the damage numbers are not reflecting it
---
No doubt, one guy killed me already but he was like level 500.  I have killed a level 40, a level 82, and a level 19 thus far.  The level 40 I killed three times.
---
The rest is from stealing (I didn't know lockpicking gave negative karma at first).  Like with the level 500 guy I broke into his bedroom and was playing his tuba and he came home and one shotted me.  Oh well, it was funny :D
---
They will absolutely get rid of repeatable SCORE challenges next time.
---
You people blasting through so quickly only to cry about it will do nothing but fuck everyone in the long run
---
(mannequinn laugh)
---
Tfw the blood eagles get a bundle before the enclave do
---
there's 8, like usual
---
Yessssssssss
---
Yeah I'm usually on around the same time but for whatever reason today I just got absolutely plowed
---
Gold bullion isn't safe either. There was a glitch to do with that yesterday
---
Man I'm sorry about that. I haven't experienced it myself on xbox but now I've said that I probably just jynxed myself.
---
I just did this, and found a black prospector's hat to go with it. Looks good, almost Film Noir.
---
Hmm, is it really!? Color me confused cause I literally checked yesterday an hour after the Daily quests reset and could only get 20 scrip from the vendor machine.
---
Nice! I have the soundtracks for Fallout 1-4 on my iphone. I listen to it while painting Wasteland Warfare minis.
---
(Taco)
---
Great week! Picked up the Blood Eagle nest prefab, the barbed and chained tires, the spiked barricade, and the cultist furniture. Have we seen the cement tires up on the shop lately?
---
This would make a good Fall Season theme, and could be expanded to include other Fallout superhero stuff. Tie in a Halloween vibe and it could include some cool items that won't work.
---
Myst is a game
---
OOF
---
Ahh that makes sense you‚Äôre clearly a weiner/winner
---
Unless I'm mistaken that's referring to [Natasha](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Natasha_Hunt) taking out the raider Kerry, right?
---
happy happy joy joy?
---
moo?
---
I love the Flamingo Units measurement. Lmao
---
On the fence about the new stuff.
---
Seeing the comments this is a well known bug. I've done this event like 20+ times never seen it before. üòÖ
---
damn
---
You have to level up on the season pass then open the menu and hit claim. Then you know the plans for it
---
and your argument is...? because "haha" isn't one.
---
Fo76 is what, a hundred holotapes sending you on fetch quests that repeat ad infinitum? that's hardly what I'd call content. the only noteworthy thing about Fo76 is the map.
---
meanwhile Project Brazil had twice as much thought put into it and Far Harbor had about the same amount of content pound for pound.
---
and if that's not enough, the NV remake sure fits the bill. the voice recording alone is more competent than Fo76 as a whole.
---
All about this!! They have that great facility that never gets used. Isn‚Äôt there some eluding to  further quests in the lore/quests?
---
You dared to touch his tuba!?
---
i like apples
---
Tesla or Grenades for the win.
---
Astounding how you got to level 50 and don't even have a clue how scrip works.
---
Taddy
---
Next we need a laughing emote
---
you too?
---
right?!?
---
I have no body or no nose. Nobody knows.
---
Scrip resets 20 hours after the last time you‚Äôve exchanged a legendary
---
i hope todd finds me, we can eat cap'n Crunch together
---
At this point I just carpet bomb any high XP event fields with my TS auto grenade launcher.
---
I have a low level friend, I have been helping,  trying to complete this quest and the same thing happened to him twice. Really sucks. This actually breaks Wastelanders.
---
nobody nose
---
They still seem to think we can manage 200 million cork... What strange event.
---
RDO is an addon though to be fair FO76 IS online only. Red Deads single player blows FO76 out the water.
---
(googles it)
---
I know, I know....  But then again I was socialized in a hole in the ground.  What did you expect?
---
P.S.  I bought my own tuba after that because it was cool.
---
Yeah I hope it gets fixed, there's always some prick who has to use their highest damage explosive weapon and if you're not spot on with your reflexes good luck tagging everything.
---
thanks for the heads up, been wanting this one for awhile.
---
Moose?
---
They reduced concrete so they will have to do something here as well, no way we do 200 million cork :D
---
campception
---
When DOES the season end, anyways?
---
Autocorfuckyou'd again.
---
Why would it be astounding that a player who plays an MMO expects the Daily/Weekly reset times to happen at the Daily/Weekly reset time? Not have its own 20 hours timer?
---
Did they explain that in-game?
---
They did. Fallout First.
---
this is the way
---
Honestly, I hope it turns out to be a scam and he just happened to have some BOS shit lying around to give us. Making this guy into a supervillain is way more interesting than bringing back the most dull faction of Kyles in the series.
---
It's getting so frustrating because I literally just want the raider gas mask. I probably could've already had it or at least been a few more spaces closer if I hadn't been f'd in the a by the auto complete bug. I lost out on 2 ranks just TODAY because of this. Just try to avoid nw, and the atom shop before you join adventure and try to not be logged in during reset
---
old news
---
If your on Xbox head over to my camp they are on the wall above my work benches. Just picked up the last one I needed the indigo a few weeks ago had the  yellow and pink for a long long time.
---
you've missed out on at least 12k SCORE and you're 5 levels ahead of me... how is that even possible.
---
I'm interested what's your perk set up?
---
Ah! You're a hypocrite, nice!
---
Yeah :)
---
Technically yes, most states have a minimum wage higher than $7.25, but only barely. Only 29 states do not use the federal minimum.
---
Ok, so I'm level 50 with a perfect build I picked while leveling. Scrip isn't as bullshit as it seemed(still really dumb).
---
What do I do now? Grind out the same events over and over and over to farm for weapons? Is there something else I can do now that all I care about is gear?
---
Holy shit. I also heard they added NPC's to the game.
---
I limited the fps to 5 below my 144 in control panel. (nvidia) That solved it for me.
---
Sorry for ask but... why is this display is posted  as the second coming of liberty  Prime?
---
Take 0 budget? 
---
Take more items? 
---
I know that.
---
That is one of the dumbest restrictions I have heard. Do they let you know this in the game at all?
---
Like... for free? :o
---
F'd in the A. Brilliant. And this game has been like a long marriage for me, I put up with the bullshit for a moment here and there of happiness. Then it all goes to rat shit again.
---
Not at all actually, my TS does not 1 shot kill everything but it does get my hits in so I at least snag kill credits.
---
It's not from high fps.
---
"Install your game on an SSD and cut down loading screens to 5 seconds!  You won't even be able to read this message before the screen goes away"
---
Jeeze dude, you‚Äôve waded in to get offended at something not directed at you, and then proceeded to explain why you aren‚Äôt guilty of it?
---
Cool? There ARE tons of those plans about. Charge 150 if you want, but they aren‚Äôt worth it and I begrudge paying the fast travel caps to arrive at someone like yours camp
---
Trust me, I will!
---
For me personally, can‚Äôt speak for others, but it looks nice, isn‚Äôt as bulky, and it does in fact hold 6 items instead of the default 4.
---
Also, it was a seasonal item only on the past, and just randomly popped up in the greatest hits tab.
---
Telsa + this glitch = XP bar viagra. It's awesome.
---
More or less. Just a weird thing for a helmet
---
Holds more than 3 items. Slimmer/smaller footprint. Looks like furniture that would actually be in a home.
---
[](/flutterbrow)
---
I play on PC, Esc gets you right back out. I gave up after one attempt at using this thing after the update (guessing whether I have enough of the ammo type to trade is not fun). I can't even imagine dealing with this on a controller.
---
At least Bethesda has community managers and is actually decent enough to communicate with its players. Rockstar is radio silent about 99% of the time about issues.
---
Cork can at least be farmed from golf balls at Hemlock Holes and Whitesprings. I imagine they'll wait two days lime they did with Concrete, determine the rate, and set it to something more realistic that can be met, like 20mil tops.
---
OP states "the game was $0 to me"
---
You have the option to pay a sub if you wish, but it's not mandatory; and not even that unacceptable given the game is F2P for a lot of people...
---
The fist shake emote being locked into a bundle is a hate crime.
---
So... this aged well, didn't it?
---
You should probably sacrifice a Beaver to appease the Mangymoose ASAP!
---
I can only see this escalating towards the Rockies at this point.
---
Good luck to you!
---
No, it looks a hell of a lot better though
---
It's absolutely crazy. Open up your Lunchbox and FEAST!!!
---
It just works!
---
It's Bloodied commando build.
---
Actually, isn't that a perfect testament to this game? Bethesda did no explanation of it's currency and how it works to the point an avid MMO player couldn't figure it out. I tried the most common sense efforts - check after daily reset, check after weekly reset. It's 2020 - reset your daily limits at the same time. Don't put in a separate 20 hour timer, what the fuck Bethesda?
---
I'm sure they are just giving people a chance to foolishly freak out and post about it.
---
While I agree with you they ain't native but since Fallout 76 is already lore breaking and not exactly 100% historically accurate to the area, it's culture, the year in which the bombs dropped, and the people that would've actually gone into and come out of these vaults I'm sure they can come up with some story like someone importing civets for a pet or a coffee based business that imported civets to create and sell expensive coffee in west Virginia.
---
Fair point actually! I take that back. ;)
---
It was their way of apologizing for my weekly challenge being autocompleted.
---
Thanks. So, I am not buying it. I want that undershirt only.
---
Prime plans do, ultracite plans don't
---
I wa sunder the impression it was only 150k
---
Edit nvm it was 150 mill but my stupid ass thought it said 150k
---
what is it from?
---
How do you make an argument against someone who says the sky is not blue and the grass is not green?  It's just such a ridiculous claim that it's difficult for me to say something other than "well look again".  Far harbor has as much content as 76??? Wtf???
---
What is the difference between an NPC on a holotape sending you on a mission as opposed to an NPC sending you on a mission?  You can dumb down almost every RPG quest to a "fetch quest" if you try hard enough.  Means nothing.  I like the holotape better because everytime I go around that area after the quest I don't have to see a dumb NPC repeating the same line to themselves that I've heard a 100 times before.  A holotape isn't annoying and a reminder that NPCs are just shallow robots that say and do the same thing every day.  
---
The pre-wastelanders story in the game told through holotapes and terminal entries is some of the best story-telling this series has ever seen.  To be able to wove such a great tale without the help of NPCs was truly an amazing feat.  The Lore for 76 was amazing until the NPCs came along and all of a sudden we were fighting for a gold which we all have tons of in our scrap boxes with the goal to make a new currency that in the future clearly never took on.  That, I will give you, is dumb.
---
I plan on selling mine like I did with concrete. Help someone else contribute since I'll never make it to 250
---
I am only counting the currencies that can be turned into multiple locations for a variety of rewards, as they are the most like a real currency. Tadpole tokens, claim token, and the many others are rewards that are ment to exchange at only one place and has zero value to anyone outside the player and singular vendor.
---
200 mil cork seemed highly unobtainable even at the outset of the event. Hope they adjust it
---
explosive legendary effect.. doesnt drop anymore, so the ones people have are the only ones left in-game, thus it's called a Legacy weapon. only way to get one legitimately is to drop serious caps (or even irl cash) to buy one from somebody.
---
Ask some duper to give you an legacy explosive flamer.
---
cheat
---
That‚Äôs what  shooting with legacy weapons (a explosive flamethrower) looks like
---
Oh hell yes! As much as I love hearing BINGLE BANGLE BUNGLE on infinite repeat...I would just sit somewhere pretty in Appalachia and listen!
---
Because everyone in the order is dead
---
It‚Äôs like the OG fallout team worked the first few months then just left the interns to run it, this OoM shit was soo fucking fallout
---
Did you try calling the gun a good boi to see if he would reload faster for ya?
---
Y'know what, there's alot of complaints about this game I can understand and agree with, but this is just silly.
---
I've always been a fallout fan. Ive always loved the series and thought an online fallout was what we were all missing. But this ain't it chief.
---
It's a legacy flamer with explosive
---
Saying that a bloodied anything performs well is like saying that any adult can beat up a toddler
---
Those have the Explosive major legendary effect and are now legacy so the only way to get one is from another player. Good luck.
---
I am on Xbox. Is your gamertag the same as it is here? I will be on in 2 hours and would like to swing by if you'll be on.
---
This. We need something like that
---
Drop all of the cork and concrete at their door. Tell them it‚Äôs for Dorsey and that you‚Äôre just a delivery driver and can‚Äôt be bothered
---
They fixed the 'exploit' in the last patch where you could make infinite screws with assaultron heads.
---
I hope so.
---
Seems like rockstar was hoping they wouldn‚Äôt have to work on RDO but realized the online mode had less to offer than no mans sky on release lol, honestly when I played RDO than swapped back to 76 I was like wow RDO is horrible
---
We gonna reach the goal no matter what even if noone gonna donate anything. It how this always been with this kind of events in all online games for years.
---
well. not the chainsaw part, but I have done that and then followed them on their journey dressed like the Easter bunny. but mostly to hide in the bushes and make sure nothing kills them. Freshcuts are different than those who annoy me by coming to my camp, and hitting me while I'm working on something.
---
Just ideas for other things we can add to our camps don't always have to be the first of its kind can just be about having something different cosmetically.
---
I was thinking stalker, myself.
---
Nope.
---
- it uses the same engine. 
---
- The scorchbeast still uses the label ‚Äúdragon‚Äù for a lot of its coding. 
---
- The fact that more than one person can fight it means diddly squat in what we were discussing
---
- This isn‚Äôt apples and oranges... and the OP‚Äôs first point is completely about the in-game mechanics. you‚Äôre just being argumentative. 
---
If you‚Äôre going to correct someone, then yes the topic we were discussing does matter. You don‚Äôt butt into someone‚Äôs conversation about their favorite movie and start rambling how books are better. Same way, if you‚Äôre going to throw in telling people they‚Äôre wrong you don‚Äôt get to just pretend like the conversation we were having revolves around what you wanted to talk about. Context matters, and you‚Äôre just ignoring it at this point so you don‚Äôt have to admit you weren‚Äôt reading.
---
Thx
---
If not this, at least an armor penetration perk. How could they not add one?
---
Read patch notes.
---
This is one of the smaller reasons. But, could you give me one reason it is smarter to have a 20-hour timer based off your last interaction with a vendor and not have it set to the daily timers? Or not set it to a 24-hour timer?
---
It is silly, but look at their design pattern. Silly things everywhere. Silly design choices everywhere don't make a good game and don't make a good foundation for an MMO you want to live for the next decade.
---
Assaltron helmet exploit was fixed with the latest update. Sorry bud
---
Nope, an strangely enough, the wood challenge/event is only 150m. Wood, the second most common junk item, steel being first.
---
Wow
---
Like a said when I followed up was I was comparing it to all my other bloodied pistols.
---
Same here man well since it got taken over by bethesda I dunno about before. But I'm keeping faith Wastelanders pulled the game back from the depths but since then it's been on it's way back down, somehow.
---
I'm looking forward to a break, personally. So much grinding.
---
True. The number is ridiculous.  
---
My main char is level 101 and has the max Standard Packpack. With its own SPECIAL and other things can carry 290lbs of stuff.  
---
I haven't been able to donate b/c apprrently Bulked and organized Steel isn't good enough for the Brotherhood of STEEL.  
---
Cork doesn't come from a lot of Junk items and I think it's at 200 million.
---
That‚Äôs my point! Stop making one location use into currencies. It‚Äôs clogging my inventory trying to keep up.
---
I had never had any connectivity issues until P21. Everything was rock-steady up until that point.
---
I have been having 2-4 DCs every evening since then.
---
After you made this post, you‚Äôre more likely to get a restraining order than a tour.  LOL
---
No reason to keep doing dailies but lots of reasons to keep playing.
---
Nothing happens. You still see the challenges and earn score, but they will not add in anymore.
---
And here I was thinking the radium rifle used the same mods as the combat rifle. I've only used one like twice. Both times in NW. You like it? It does radiation damage only or both physical and radiation?
---
this would be awesome but there‚Äôs gotta be a shit ton of stories that‚Äôs updated regularly, or else we‚Äôll all listen to all of them in a 4 hour gaming session and never visit the radio again :(
---
Damn! Hadn‚Äôt thought of that, I‚Äôm too busy listening to Dutch and his constant ‚Äòplans‚Äô.
---
I can't think of a game where the goal wasn't met
---
No, the classic G3 style Fo3 assault rifle skin.
---
So is that the concrete one failed ?  Looks like it's moved on to Cork...I thought it would be midnight but maybe at the daily update ?
---
Showing the banner part on the Event page as still locked anyway.
---
Bethesda...you are utter clowns. People told you the numbers were insane, you did the right thing lowering it but still it's a struggle because the stuff simply isn't there to be had.
---
Cork is still at 200 million too. WHY ??!
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt think people realize that lol, most you could do is mayor for the day and make it so you don‚Äôt get attacked by factions, or have interiors to factions / buildings that you change, be kinda awkward for anyone trying to do settlers quests and as a raider you kill them haha just doesn‚Äôt work for online games.
---
I play a pretty decent amount since I've been out of work and I run sbq several times a day. I run the hell out of events and I use every exp boost i can get with my unyielding armor. It's the only way I can make up for the lost score.
---
Why are you here?
---
Good for photos but I'm not giving up the shielded perks and buffs. üòâ
---
You should be good, not sure why this is happening.
---
Good idea but how about they just add the possibility of current chickens in the cage giving not just fertilizer but eggs too?
---
(scraps Tattered Field Jacket)
---
That's also very true considering every other weapon type has it
---
If you liked the first one you‚Äôre in for a real treat once you get around to it. Just an epic, epic game.
---
I retort not because I'm offended (you're the one insulting legit players), nor do I care who you were initially talking to, but simply because you're wrong. Welcome to the internet. 
---
I'm commenting because you're making absolute statements which are relatively inaccurate. You're basically going around spreading disinformation, and someone calls you out in the comments, so you get defensive.
---
I'm just trying to drive home the point that not everything in the game is duped, and yes, there are tons of people who don't have a full set of gear and want to drop some dosh on plans they don't have. Supply and Demand, bro. So yeah, pretty cool!
---
Why does this feel like their not so subtle way of apologizing for bungling the last patch, among other things.
---
I don‚Äôt even know how you could have explored the whole map by level 50. Do you just fast travel everywhere and fast click through terminals? This game is all about exploring. If honestly don‚Äôt even know how you complete all the main quest within 50 levels.
---
Actually some companies have let us fail community events. I know PopCap let us fail one of the community events in their shooter PvZGW2.
---
I bet there are more examples of this in more we‚Äôll known games but I bet it depends on the company. The question is - does Bethesda even have the authority to let us fail an event without facing mass community backlash? They‚Äôre already on bad terms with the community so a community event is the perfect highlight to test this
---
Hence the LOL I added.
---
I'm just super disappointed that everyone involved with the OOM is dead.
---
I would like to redo this quest. The crafting became crap once you accidently throw out base event item.
---
I once to rebuy voice of set from another player.
---
yeah instabuy
---
Wow, finally something I want but haven‚Äôt had power for 27 hours...
---
Its actually Beth saying sorry to us rn
---
They basically said 76 was just an offshoot that they wanted to keep online / updated consistently, personally way I take it is this is Bethesda‚Äôs attempt at making online co-op working out the bugs on a larger scale to maybe add it to 2-4 player co-op in the new fallout, since they introduced the personalized instances etc
---
I wish it was an actual scout of the BOS and not a fanboy.
---
Do you really only play because of the season?
---
It's a Fun bug, it'll get fixed, the meat piles pile up for lag, but still fun.
---
THAT would be cool. Love the Responders. It'd be awesome if there were special events that you could only join if you were allied with a specific faction.
---
Yeah,.GT is the same send me a message I might be on my alt then so I can switch to my main. To clarify they are not for sale as it took me over 12 months to get the last one.
---
I got the pink first just after beta from a super mutant
---
Bought the yellow from the vendor at Camden park and it was a spawn as he sells a bay sometimes and was on a private server u just need to check the colour.
---
After many many attempts I managed to trade for one. It was a high end trade but it didn't matter to me I just needed it to finish the collection.
---
I researched and they drop in government drops and the event from Morgantown airport but I got fed up doing these as I was getting nowhere.
---
A few weeks ago someone was selling all 3 on the trading sub so you might be able to put a request out but they will cost you a lot.
---
google "Brad pitt 12 monkeys eye roll gif"
---
It doesn't. I have a rifleman build and my 50 hunting rifle isn't able to beat my lever action. Which is pretty disappointing.
---
Yea sorry, I realized I was being being unnecessarily defensive  haha.
---
I would honestly choose neither and go for a +33% vats hit combat shottie. I use one on my stealth shotgunner and would never go back to a DB or having to reload a pump.
---
I think two different pistols could be a bit too strong, as you could essentially have a "6 star" legendary, having a perk have you hold one you equip twice is a better solution in my opinion but it's a very cool concept
---
Gotta remember here on reddit is the minority, and you‚Äôll always see 10+ posts complaining to the 1+ positive, and reddit really does work as a negative hive mins
---
red asylum that you hunted for and found in the asylum? or one that you bought or traded for?
---
I've never even used one outside of NW either. I just buy them if they're real cheap because I'm a completionist when it comes to weapon mods. Even still I'm not even remotely close to all of the mods for that gun, it's ridiculous how hard it is to get anything from scrapping them.
---
Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. Just power armor.
---
picked up a BSS sledgehammer from a vendor for 100 caps yesterday, and in my greed- didn't realize it was level 10 :(
---
I'd say I have 80% of the map discovered. I do fast travel everywhere - I'd be level 20 if I didn't.  
---
For me exploration isn't as fun cause the Xbox graphics are oooof and MMOs can take that wind out of my sails. Sure I might find a neat hut with easter eggs, but being online with level 400s around... I know they have been to every inch of the map. And this is my 4th fallout at least. Only so much joy to get from exploring a wasteland.
---
Agreed! It was my favourite quest I've done so far, I had so much fun with it.
---
well yeah but that doesnt stop us spilling the beans like we did to those soldiers
---
Most like the event started on a preset timer, but all the resources are handled manually. They probably have to change the required amount of cork separately like they have to enter the gathered amount manually. Probably will see it change this evening or tomorrow am
---
so many people are like this and i'm like 'why bother "playing" if you're not gonna actually play'
---
Actually a really good idea \^\^
---
Traded a bol sent marine set for it
---
That's true.
---
Any Savage Divide event plus Messenger can give the jumpsuit collection
---
I‚Äôm confused. I didn‚Äôt say everything is duped. I‚Äôve already said that I thought ultracite were but I was wrong which ive also already said. What more do you want? I‚Äôm defensive cos I feel like you‚Äôre having a moan for the sake of it when I‚Äôve already said I was wrong
---
That's pretty terrible and also unacceptable.
---
Haven't logged in a few weeks. Nothing interesting going on for the game. Did the Bullion grind did the score grind. Now what? This game really needs end game content. Running the same 4 events over an over is been done..
---
aye. it's proper fucked
---
using a TS Auto grenade launcher myself and it takes off about a quarter of their hp without demo expert, i feel bad when I accidentally leave it on though, while I don't 1shot the scorched, it does deal far too much damage to allow everyone to get their tags in.
---
the board flips over and it's blank
---
Sad truth vanilla oblivion is better üòÇ just down to the block mechanic.. I know it‚Äôs a test of skill but like not on a fucking laggy ass server lol
---
Or he needs to seriously consider OCD medication
---
Yes, accept inviye and I'll join you
---
Maybe it‚Äôs not the game for you then. The map is the highlight of this game. You miss a lot by fast traveling everywhere.
---
fuck man... well done.
---
You guys built a fort?
---
Aww, I want one too üòç
---
they screwed us
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. The only thing the BoS is good for us blowing up and then parachuting away from their burning zeppelins.
---
The mothman cult and order of mysteries - heck even the blood eagles should get a lot more lore and story development.
---
I would wholeheartedly embrace an order of mysteries focus and go collect all sorts of weird sh.t to help.
---
we fail
---
Wow what a surprise another broken thing in the game
---
That's... Really weird. I spawn in the exact same spot, off to the side of my main building, ever single load in. However, anyone who teleports to me, and not the camp, seems to spawn INSIDE my Arktos Pharma Biome, scared witless by Thudds McKenzie.
---
This is definitely something that needs looked at.
---
Do you have the password?
---
Or we could kill them and loot their corpes :3
---
We need an "Unstoppables" serial radio station.
---
No, they arent. This is a smokescreen pure and simple. They are hoping people will make posts exactly like the OP and start talking about how bethesda appears to be changing for the better.
---
They are not.
---
If you have a suitable camp build, then you can place it again. I have a mobile camp vendor on one of my characters which I can place the camp again and the vendors will be filled still. Some recommend placing vendors in a small out building separate from your camp proper.
---
just everything, but it's the canadian sorry
---
I don‚Äôt get it either. My problem with seasons is I do feel like I need to do the challenges. I would be happy to be done the run so I can focus on actually enjoying the game haha. There is a lot to do besides the run, same thing for grinding gold and legendaries. I‚Äôm lucky I don‚Äôt feel the need to do that.
---
Apparently we get Bethesda to be reasonable. If this pattern keeps up then hopefully cork will be adjusted
---
ahh not so bad then.  if you had farmed for that for months then F wouldn't even begin to express the tragedy; still sucks horrendously.
---
They're probably going to be antagonistic towards both factions, but you'll be the intermediary for doing things in the wasteland.
---
Like every Fallout quest ever.
---
Anyways, I'm not convinced having actual consequences for your choices would actually be in Bethesda's best interests. Since we're using perpetual characters, do you have any idea just how fucking upset people would be unknowingly locking themselves out of rewards or making themselves permanent enemies of a faction? For all you folks currently saying "wow yes consequences plz", there'll be hundreds of people making a choice and then realising they fucked themselves and want to revert it.
---
This is the inherent issue with every MMO ever made, when we're using characters that aren't disposable like in a single player game.
---
I appreciate that - I just want to see them. I could just Google it I suppose but seeing them "in person" is better. So the vendor bot you mention, is that the one that hangs around by the employee shack where you turn in the fuzzy tokens? I have only looked at his inventory a handful of times. I also have a bunch of those supply requisitions - looks like I need to start calling them in ü§ì
---
The first* time.
---
Ghost Recon Wildlands...community events failed all the time.
---
Nope. Go read the spoiler unencrypted transmissions.
---
Pretty sure you can complete just from junk in the wayward
---
Cork is tough, but I have already contributed 500 and cork can be farmed by scrapping pipe weapons from dead enemies. And there are certain places in the map where enemies with pipe weapons are common. The cork sucks, but I don't see it being as bad as the concrete, where you are at the mercy of random spawns.  The output from pipe weapons is low(ish) but it's not like concrete where I often found zero concrete in places where it is supposed to spawn.  Super mutants in Grafton, Grafton Steel and Grafton dam drop plenty of pipe weaponry. That is far different from a server where there is zero concrete  anywhere in the server because somebody already looted it.
---
Still not sure why people lock their water purifiers...I mean, it isn't like they don't produce more.
---
Yep and that would work if day one wasn‚Äôt 4 million and day 2 was 8. Day one being a Sunday. Lots of people on with their stash donations. And day two a Monday when it‚Äôs not initial stash donations on a target of 150 million and day one had achieved 4. Seems a little fishy to me
---
Nah demo expert is useless right now
---
Well, I was hoping that the Gear chasing would be enough to make it the game for me. It was never the exploration that grabbed me in. And you can tell I'm coming from MMO land - Exploration will never keep someone in a game forever unless the map is constantly being added to. I tend to play games that give me cool shit to play with.
---
I love the Order of Mysteries! I currently wear the whole outfit as it provides a lot of great protection in the wasteland!
---
Oh yea I saw that too, they‚Äôve got that G3 (the R91 rifle in fallout) and a plain fo3 style version of the Chinese assault rifle. I‚Äôd kill for either but I want both.
---
They do take suggestions once or twice a year. We are screwed now till probably the middle of next year.
---
That seems really frequent. Are you sure it‚Äôs not an issue on your end? It used to be like that for me in 2018
---
I have a grenade launcher which is the ultimate tag master. Also, molotovs. You can just rain them non stop and have fun, and fire. Those shitty flamer grenades which can't be sold also count. 
---
Lots of fire. 
---
A plasma with the flamer mod also works great.
---
If not eggs might definelty be toxic right lol
---
I'm curious what kind of player base they've got going. I can't be the only one who dicked around online for about a week tops before bailing forever due to griefers. It was real bad, like nothing I've ever seen in FO76. Like dickheads following me around the entire map bad.
---
Why the hell were the taxidermy plans not rare loot off the appropriate mobs? Would have made much more sense to me.
---
I mean seeing it‚Äôs dropped is motivation for most, and who knows how often they updated the number could be every 12 hours or 24 etc
---
wow what an assholes...
---
Beth already changed concrete goal and probably rigged the results... I think it's good enough hint they not gonna let us fail the event.
---
So? It‚Äôs their game and they can sell whatever they want. They do not have to play to appease you and make it ‚Äúworth‚Äù the trip in your opinion. If you are that concerned about wasting caps then do not go to vendors...simple as that. Simply take your chances with the purveyor and various buying and selling groups on the web. Also, after level 50 (100tops) caps should not be a problem and if you are having trouble with caps something is wrong, IMO.
---
life goes on
---
[edit: yes, this is a reference to Chris Burke]
---
[edit: godammit, not like that you jerks]
---
Lol don't give them any ideas now.
---
Same! It was the best way I could think of to honor how much she loves the character. Can you imagine how cool it would be if after her questline is finished, you guys talk about the order and you can encourage her to go take up the mantle of the mistress?
---
It's not a plot hole. The actual start date was misinterpreted by wiki users from the fallout bible  (which hasn't been canon for the past 15 years)
---
I mean I did spend months grinding for the gear to trade for the set, and months making the trades lol. But yeah haha. Just wanted to throw it on my allie
---
No it‚Äôs every 24. When the score resets. Sunday it was 4.2 I think. Monday it was 12.6 and the target changed to 15 lol
---
Class Freak
---
It's okay dude. We're all bros here. I just have a very blunt way of communicating. Glad we've clarified any misconceptions.
---
True but just as we can have multiple collectrons another platform that collects  honey would still be ok and this would still be the first honey collector of its kind.
---
Bloodied/Unyielding stealth commando.
---
Others are strong, but not that strong.
---
The technical highest dps is food buff stacking bloodied unarmed melee, but only on paper. In practice its a trash fire outside very specific situations.
---
The first few months after launch were *bad*. Absolute silence from Bethesda apart from telling people they couldn't get a refund.
---
I just checked &amp; refreshed the page on my phone and it still appears locked, while the rest of the page already moved to the cork part of the event.
---
The green color of the arrow that shows event progression may not necessarily indicate that the challenge was cleared, just that we are past it.
---
Still, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if whoever updated the page simply messed up somehow (shocking, isn‚Äôt?), so... wait and see I guess?
---
Yeah that's the vendor, sometimes it will say chain wrapped baseball bat or similar you just need to examine the bat to see the colour. If I kill any enemy with a bat I always examine it before I scrap or sell it as you never know.
---
Yeah, I bought the bundle a minute ago - the salute is still there! Enjoy yours!
---
My original hope was that with the return of BoS there would be a resurgence of the Responders and the events that players took part in during the lead up to their return would help define the strength/weakness of the groups. 
---
For example - if players really helped push the Responders they would be in a stronger position with more resources than the BoS or vice versa.
---
But they really love the BoS so that will be it for a bit I guess.
---
Personally I'm just building up my Responder police character...all pistols and shotguns. I've already started building the first new police station. 
---
I just can't wait to get my hands on some of the West Virginia state police stuff someone saw (on a dmine I guess).
---
It's a glitch. Somebody was farming ammo at the workshop.
---
I mean I believe it if it was like 30 and we jumped that much hell no, but just double what we did in one day is believable, who knows how much people in other time zones play this game lol, I remember someone on dragon age inquisition literally played only multiplayer for 13 hours a day since release, he was on my friends like and whenever they did events for killing like dragons for example he‚Äôd spend every second killing them.
---
So as far as adults wooping on kids this one woops the hardest in my child wooping opinion.
---
Are you sure they were not the ammo generators from the converted munitions factory. There‚Äôs a glitch that allows players to do this.
---
Yes, someone blueprinted the ammo factory extractor and plopped some down at this workshop. now the workshop has an inkling of incentive to use.
---
Capture, profit, defend.
---
Should include the ones about shooting the queen in the air and standing on stuff.
---
Cork is a part of England that has never conformed to change, even their half-pence were deemed "non-currency" prior to 1875
---
They nerfed super duper.
---
"Eat people."
---
let this be a lesson, kids... before you come on to the internet to elaborately shit on something, make sure you know what you're talking about.
---
That's fair.
---
I don‚Äôt know, I have 900 hours in and still find new things when walking around
---
You need to read the piece of paper that says "!hope for the future"
---
Old World Radio - Boston, on YouTube(it's the Fallout Radio 2 station), has one sponsored by Hubris comics with lots of this stuff on it. I listen to it sometimes.
---
It's excellent. Give it a listen...it's exactly what you're talking about. Just turn off the radio and in-game soundtrack on 76 and play that on your pad or phone maybe. I do. Loads of other stations too. Sadly Old World Blues, the New Vegas one( with Dusty Duuude) is corrupt and is just static now, still hasn't been fixed...it was terrific..!
---
I don‚Äôt have access to the ps4 so i cannot remote play
---
I'm sure we did. You're looking at the same thing we are.
---
I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs the John Travolta meme
---
Whats your ign?
---
yea! i want my walls to have that 70's show vista cruiser feel
---
No it‚Äôs not. With more players on. People donating their stash on day one and day two. After seeing 4.2 million with 150 million needed you think that would prompt less players to donate 200% more?  It‚Äôs not close to believable.
---

---
My wife and I did that stoyline back in Dec 18. 
---
She spent hours trying to figure out how to finish it and didn't realise you had to use the terminal.
---
We were watching Hilda on Netflix when Alfo the elf said something to the effect of  "All the best legends involve paperwork" 
---
My wife stood up and almost screamed,
---
"I have to do the paperwork!"
---
Logged onto 76, ran to The Riverside Mansion and found the terminal to promote herself.
---
I lol'd all night.
---
If we get a bunch of people to ask maybe we can get them to add them, missed out on the raider tent because of the lack of content
---
One of the employees *did* say they were working on one so I‚Äôm not exactly surprised
---
This Canuck is :)
---
Dang, that sucks.  Well hopefully can find a good solution.  Good luck!
---
worst case? no, (shrug, sadness, motivation)
---
if the crying is bothering you, maybe you're not cut out for raider life
---
Know all we need is the artificial wood wallpaper
---
nuke it
---
Yes we did
---
TP the foyer.
---
What would you need cork for?
---
I experienced this bug. Once you go back and re-read the scribe‚Äôs terminal, when you go to the centrifuge‚Äôs terminal there should be an option to power up the centrifuge, a which allows you to proceed in the quest.
---
I half expected to have some sort of serial or series to listen to in FO76 since all the others (FO3, FO4) did as well. Alas, it was not so. I‚Äôd be down for this, or even just down for them to inject some of the stories from holotapes you can find. Hell...the lady who did the voice acting for those series lived outside of Charleston. Give us a mission to recover some of her old recordings and have us deliver them to Julie.
---
Edit: To clarify, I‚Äôm talking about the Mistress of mystery. Let‚Äôs hear some of those stories.
---
Right? But in my defense, how was I supposed to know the Scrip goes back to the vendor machine 20 hours after I got scrip from the vendor machine.
---
That's so fucking odd. And never explained in-game.
---
To add - everyone really hopped on the Scrip train, but truth is most people still think it sucks and ignored every other point. People in this subreddit don't really want to hear about how the game isn't good.
---
No it is good manners.
---
Big babies will claim you are griefing and exploiting and will try their damndest to get you banned for the playing the game.
---
(pictures Red Foreman print)...
---
(agrees violently)
---
You may not have seen my CAMP.  
---
I play only as Silver Shrouuuuud! (with the voice and costume) and I've got all the Mistress gear in a display box with "Goodbye my friend" on the wall.  
---
(I had one person say "Oh shit, you're real?  I thought you were in-game audio!")
---
aye
---
I'm looking at it right now without perk cards and a lever with hardened does 184 and a hunting with .50 receiver does 186.
---
I think you might be the exception. Glad it's fun though By all means, I hope they make the game even better and you can enjoy it more.
---
Yep same thing here 4 weeklies and 3 dailys. Logged on 30 minutes ago. Didn't go to nuclear winter or the atom shop first.
---
We have only been asking for it, for two freaking years now! We are screwed now we won't get anything we ask for, for another two years.
---
I mean roughly 30,000 players on fallout and If it‚Äôs 15 mil that‚Äôs roughly what 500 per player? Even if it‚Äôs only 20k players that‚Äôs still 750 per player.
---
What did it say?
---
Because it had to be good since he deleted his entire account.
---
Yeah, youre right, contexte matters. So when someone asks a question about something, you should understand that people corrects you regarding the question asked. If not, well, you won, youre the best and it will remain that way because I hate wheb People are condescendant when they dont even answer the question. And everything you said could be said to you too, but the diff√©rence is that I answered the opening question, not you.
---
I just kept killing raiders, even the friendly ones.
---
What do you mean?
---
so the materials things is a method to cut down all the duped materials in game from the display glitches right?
---
Ah.  The 2 times I've had it happen to me(once back when challenges were for Atoms) were during a reset.  I just chocked it up to that &amp; avoided that scenario at all costs.
---
Its 15 items, and I believe its per seperate fridge. So if you have the arktos pharma one and the nuka cola one I believe you can store 15 in each fridge. The items will still show up in your stash however but with a snowflake logo next to them and its only perishable items but for some reason I keep having a berry mentats show up for no reason even when I don't have one.
---
Is this a bragging contest? My melee can do more than 10 000 to the SBQ;)
---
Not really interested in the handmade, but wil l definitely be doing this eun a few times. Thanks!

Does anyone know if the plague power armor skin is coming back to the shop?
---
Double points coming, so maybe you‚Äôll be good
---
This has happened several times to me with a non-explosive shotgun.
---
there are quite a few golf courses in Cork, Ireland...
---
Ty
---
Clearly you don‚Äôt play the game given that comment.
---
I mean it‚Äôs supposed to be a part of the game but almost no one uses it. Stealing purified water is a weird one because you generate that stuff in mass quantities, so I‚Äôm not sure why anyone would A) lock their purifiers and B) steal from purifiers.
---
To get rid of a bounty someone has to kill you.
---
Bethesda advertises this as a pve adventure as well as a pvp adventure, but both were fudged originally and since, it has become more geared towards pve with pvp players moving mostly to NW.
---
Not your fault at all, just very unusual
---
Thabks this worked along with reading the note
---
it was todd... he said (todd face)
---
Avo Messiah, lvl 59. Shoot me a message if i'm on and i'll play with you
---
Gamma gun
---
I believe so. I have another fridge that also has 50%
---
It‚Äôs MY base.
---
Yep but your not factoring in things like.....I‚Äôm level 275. I have 5 toons the other four are all over 50. I have fo1st. I don‚Äôt buikd. I have 972 concrete and collect and scrap a lot. Also the motivation of seeing 4 million done with 146 million more to do isn‚Äôt going going to inspire anyone to go throwing their scrap into a bottomless pit for a reward they couldn‚Äôt possibly attain. Let‚Äôs see if we make the cork 200 million target. Which no doubt will go down to 20. I have 421 cork. I don‚Äôt use cork for anything.
---
Good luck actually getting those hits to register
---
Ah, ok, haven't logged in in a while
---
No, server hop
---
Picking sides basically is juat you deciding on who you want to split the gold if you want to split it. After you raid 79 you will still be able to max rep with both factions, just will take a bit
---
I heard so much about this, what level do you need to do it?
---
I was hoping my misfortune might bring joy to a few around here, glad to see that happen, so thank you! :)
---
Alright, will do, thank you!
---
Sneak Perk + Ninja or Covert Op = BIG DAMAGE
---
i'll take a fair rating!
---
(throws macaroni at roomate)
---
Not sure really... I believe I was around 25-30 when I started it.
---
Hey we did pass the concrete just saw that it is unlocked.
---
That looks really dope! Gonna have to give that a try for myself.
---
I don‚Äôt think there is another way to prevent this other than limiting your fps. It seems to be bi-product from the haphazard fix by Bethesda to unconnect the physics engine from the framerate. I would suggest the same as DynamittHarry2020 and cap your FPS below your refresh rate and see if you still have tearing.
---
It‚Äôs not as bad as it was back when it started but it‚Äôs still not great. They changed the distance you can see player dots, added some other safe guards for defensive players but the game still caters to griefers.
---
Three
---
That's really awesome, it turned out great. I tried the rug trick for the first time last night to put stuff on metal shelves so that was really exciting for me lol this is next level though. It looks great.
---
Which part B of why we lost yesterday's event.
---
This^ our armor and outfits should be entirely seperate (can I argue outfits should weigh nothing?). On top of that, we should be able to have armor load outs.
---
Hey I mean when you have too much mass in a given volume it‚Äôs destined to turn into a black hole and distort reality at some point
---
i will have to try that. i have a 1\* Instigators Combat Shotgun. got it as a SBQ reward a long time ago, with all the shotgun perks i currently use with it i can one shot a lot of higher level enemies when using VATS, but the second i don't use VATS i have to take multiple shots to take them down.
---
Same!  Will server hop to see if that fixes it.  SMH
---
Baronik
---
Maybe it's just that people are tired of hearing the same complaints? They jumped on the Scrip one because that one doesn't come up often.
---
Also pipe weapons scrap.  I got a ton from the super mutants at grafton steel
---
Like I said people play in different times and have different motivation, I donated over 4K concrete lol I‚Äôm sure others did too I‚Äôm sure one crazy bastard probably has 20k never underestimate people who only have one game to play
---
Yep. Got em all after One Violent Night.
---
gunpowder
---
Only happened to me once. If you‚Äôre doing Nuclear Winter or checking out the Atom Shop make sure to hop back onto Adventure Mode before you stop playing.
---
Morgantown
---
Yes. 
---
The 12.5 number was from yesterday. It‚Äôs not updated in real time. If you check the events page now you can see it says it completed.
---
Mad Max vibees
---
Yes and no. Yes because you just ruined a SBQ fight but no because that‚Äôs a part of the game
---
Someone hit Morgantown yesterday. Been months since I've seen that one.
---
Last time I tried to do this quest it wouldn't update when I killed creatures with grants saber. I stopped trying and still have it.
---
They will just lower the goal and boost the amount they enter that people turned in again, so it doesn't fail like the others.  They will not let it fail, don't worry.  That would make them look even worse.  I haven't donated anything yet due to no carry weight left, and haven't seen anybody up there on xbox donating anything, yet they miraculously complete each time.  I can think of better things to do with my time than spending a day server hopping to collect hundreds of virtual golf balls, for some virtual booze or plans that I already have all of them on the list, and dropping it all on the ground.
---
Okay you didn't go into NW or the Atom store, but did you stand on your head watching old episodes of "Who's the Boss?" in a mirror while you were offline?
---
I bet you didn't. 
---
That's the trick of course, I'm pretty sure customer service at Beth knows it but they just don't want to tell us so that players will buy atoms to complete.
---
Can't complain about it if you're not willing to do the fix on your end you know. No really, it's true. 
---
Oh and also you should record it post it here so we can all...umm...see the proof that it works.
---
I've been playing for about a year and half on Xbox and PC and while I cannot offer any proof that it isn't on my end I can say that I've had this issue on both systems and only with this game. I do not d/c this frequently from any other games that I play. I also have seen quite a few others complaining about this issue so I know I'm not alone. I have also seen bethesda acknowledge server instability in the past.
---
Fully agree!
---
It was bad enough that they forced them in the vanilla game, though I applaud them for properly exiting them at the time to avoid lore conflicts with FO3.
---
But now they are forcing them in again, and apparently as a major plot device, which I‚Äôm not in favor of.
---
FO76 had plenty of unique factions they could have explored, not just the Responders, Free States, Foundation and Crater, but the Order of Mysteries, Mothman Cultists, Free Radicals and even splinter factions like Modus Enclave, the Fire Breathers, the other raider gangs or maybe even Chinese remnants. And let‚Äôs not forget the one faction normally left out, despite its major involvement everywhere: Vault-Tec.
---
At this point the BoS feels both forced and out of place in FO76.
---
Well I am suggesting Golf for those who want to save ammo.
---
My friend and I discussed this and agree 76 needs a couple of more stations. 50s stuff is great, but Appalachia is steeped in all the folk and old timey stuff, we really need a station with all that on it. Think the 'Oh Brother Where Art Thou' soundtrack etc.
---
There are a tonne of good amateur bands out there that I'd bet would donate tracks for free, just to be heard. Imagine talented Fallout fans sending in 'Stories from Appalachia' too and the good ones getting put on for maybe Atom prizes ?
---
Also a crazy yokel/hillbilly Talk Radio channel could be immense. Get in young wanna-be comedians to help develope it and again allow fans to contribute.
---
Wild, quirky channels(vetted of course), that could make the game legendary. There doesn't need to be copyright fees if you do it another way. Look at GTA. Loads of terrific pop/rock and other great songs, but they've always had talk stuff and daft ads too. Lots of top fan efforts already. Bethesda could do themselves a big favour an approach these people to help.
---
Two channels is not enough.
---
We've also hit 15 million posts asking about this.
---
just like every other golf resort, whatever belligerence you do, will be forgotten and ignored
---
I'm not buying the rest, there's likely about 28 days left, even with no xp grinding I'll finish the last 10 levels within 11 days just doing the dailies and weeklies.
---
I'm not playing any extra though, bored with it.
---
I‚Äôm sure this is an intentional conspiracy by Bethesda to get people to buy ranks. Honest I feel like as a gesture of good faith, they should give the entire community a bunch of free points, if not for the auto complete issue at least for the overall horrible design of the season pass.
---
Finally the standard fridge and display shelf are back. I can finish my kitchen.
---
I fiund such a setup at another workshop. I claimed the workshop (owner must've logged off) and powered up the machines bit couldn't interact with the terminals and they didnt produce any ammo.
---
Yes, same with raider items, the fridge and the Thanksgiving display case. Neat stuff
---
You do you and have fun and how other ppl react isn't on you.  So long as you aren't being toxic in area voice or being pest to ppl who clearly don't want to fight imo it's the other ppl taking this shit way too seriously if they freak over pvp.
---
For me the keys stopped working. Only one movement button worked indoors. I thought my keyboard was fubar. Limited the fps by 10 below and its fine.
---
I listen to Radioclassics on SXM. All the great oldies.
---
Oh don‚Äôt get me wrong server stability has certainly been an issue in the past. I play on Xbox though and it is pretty rare that I get disconnected. It still happens occasionally, but it‚Äôs certainly not hourly or every time I play.
---
Shannon rivers got what she had coming to her for senseless man hating. The raider her daughter betrayed her for was a boy she refused to adopt post war, karmas a bitch
---
I changed my chars sex to wear the dress.
---
Yeah, what do we do with that xd
---
do all the quests on both sides (get the stealth suit from settlers) before you choose. you can ultimately get both reps to max anyway
---
i feel this. i would love to have glow sighted and tank killer at the same time but i have all the rifleman perks maxed out and equipped constantly because i rely heavily on my 3\* explosive handmade as a backup weapon.
---
They used to but wankers used them to trap and kill people and then steal their junk. So Bethesda removed the option.
---
Maybe a union and confederate hat?
---
Not sure this post is allowed on this sub but I would say 5k
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Your smile though 
---
üòçüò≠
---
if you see the encryptid event, do it and play medic
---
Lol these Fallout fanboys dislike anything criticizing the game. Just give it a rest bro let them play their buggy dying game in peaceüòÇ
---
Thought I put this in market, thanks for the heads up
---
What‚Äôs so good about concrete
---
fuck tonne
---
Instigating fatman, I think, is the only viable legendary fat man. Not sure the other two slots, probably mutant's for just a flat 10% damage boost (which 10% of such a larger number is pretty hefty.) It is the only way to do the most damage, I think, doubling its output with the one shot (making it actually feel like a proper fatman), but is entirely conditional on it being the first damage a creature takes. 
---
I like the Daisycutter, because it isn't 60 goddamn pounds, and you can switch the MIRV back to standard for more damage for harder enemies. Or keep the MIRV and just hunt lower level areas to gather all the enemies into a group, and wipe them in one spread out MIRV shot. Great for certain lower level map events (like those enemy swarm horde events), to knock out those event SCORE dailies and weeklies. But I have not had luck with RNGesus with seeing other fat man. This is merely all a hypothesis on if it would make the gun viable
---
Still happening, after update 21!  I have video showing I have Sludge Lung, but the challenge doesn't register it.  :(
---
Good call. I haven't seen the event for a while sadly. Just bad timing I guess.
---
Sorry, I didn‚Äôt see any.
---
morgantown highschool has a decent supply of golfballs and globes.  And you can pre-stock on plastic cafeteria trays and halloween pumpkins while you're there
---
in my experience you for whatever reason don't spawn at the Camp device location of your own camp but other people do. everybody else pops right onto my front porch where the device was originally placed, but i always spawn outside of my own camp walls.
---
Sorry, meant to say reason to play daily. It's not that I don't want to play anymore, but it would be nice to not *have* to play every day to satisfy the grind.
---
&gt;How do you make an argument against someone who says the sky is not blue and the grass is not green?
---
I could ask you the same thing. or maybe you're just not analyzing both instances closely enough.
---
&gt;You can dumb down almost every RPG quest to a "fetch quest" if you try hard enough.
---
that's my point, though. you don't even need to try with Fo76, every quest is dumbed down from the start. quests are indeed designed like that, their core is essentially always "go to X, kill Y, fetch me Z". but the presentation is embellished to be as complex and entertaining as possible. in Fo76 everything (bar a couple noteworthy mentions) is literally **just** go to X, kill Y, fetch me Z. it's lazy and uninspired.
---
the problem isn't the holotapes or the terminals. that's a completely valid way of telling a story. I actually agree with you, I think Fo76 was more enjoyable *before* wastelanders. and that's because we had to imagine the people behind the holotapes, their struggles and how they ultimately met their end. it's bittersweet and engaging. unlike seeing a poorly animated NPC that bugs out every other encounter. imagine how much less annoying Ward would be in holotape form.
---
but that doesn't change the fact that, holotape or otherwise, no quest in Fo76 is comparable to the Fo4 or Skyrim DLC, or even mods like New California. because all of them are extremely shallow and padded out with nauseating repetition to make up for the lack of thought put into them. *that's* the problem here.
---
repetition isn't content. it's disingenuous design used by mobile developers to pad out actual content and spend as little money as possible, leaving the actual heavy lifting to their playerbase in the form of daily logins, limited currency, etc. and if you ignore all the meaningless busywork in Fo76, its content is nowhere near that of many mods out there, let alone better games like Fo4 or Skyrim.
---
Whats the FU rating for the Thanksgiving display ?
---
saw  harpers for the collosus (sp) but the flux was garbage
---
Been waiting for it!!!!
---
Does your character control like they're actually over encumbered? Hoping it's just a visual bug with the UI not updating.
---
Depends on the weapon. All plans will allow you to craft them yourself. 
---
Certain weapons (fixer, bear arm, basically any weapons added in DLC) require you to know the plan in order to get legendary variants. This does not apply to any weapons available at the game‚Äôs launch.
---
How about an Agility perk that provided a massive buff to pistol RoF when in VATS?
---
Red dead 2‚Äôs story is far, far better than the entirety of 76 in my opinion, I still love 76, though
---
sounds good
---
I believe they will need all the steel and concrete to rebuild with the amounts of nukes we will be launching against them.
---
Didn‚Äôt Frederick, Shannon‚Äôs husband survive?
---
yep, death camps ate face (Tossed into a fissure, funny but meh)...
---
best idea to keep reconfiguring your camp box for a viable spawn (test and repeat)
---
I agree. That was a good storyline with fun quests.
---
And after that, "Sorry, not sorry."
---
I gotcha. I'm also planning a break when I hit 100 as well. My poor video game backlog.
---
Had it all in my stash. Got rid of all my misc items, all ammo I don't need, most of the ammo that I do need, all my food, over half my chems.
---
I got rid of a ton of my own stuff even after giving him everything he had me transfer for him. 
---
Getting an item out of my stash will add weight, but even after using that item immediately I still weigh just as much and don't go back to my original weight.
---
I just keep gaining weight and having to drop more and more of my things I need.
---
Doesn't help having griefers kill me while trying to do the build weekly at a workshop, while I'm in build mode. They took all my junk that I had been trying to make back, and followed me around the map harassing me until I hopped on my private server.
---
Just sick of the bugs that make it unplayable, and the players that enjoy stalking, harassing, and making people miserable on top of it all.
---
They gonna need to call Mr. House.
---
My survival tip would be dont be a butt hole
---
F A T M A N
---
they will port it, but there wont be some huge upgrade to the game because of the new consoles.
---
Atlas is a high tech toy made to control the weather i think they'll have no problem with a few robots but you're right

I believe it's every members duty to rain down the full power of our nuclear arsenal upon this brotherhood.
---
Always use mine on Morgan Town.
---
legendary from purveyor turn ins (scrip) = plans you know...
---
Legendary from 3* mobs = random
---
I heard that this one was a free gift at some point in the past.
---
Scorched Earth is also a good one.
---
I can help. What can i do for u
---
I hear people complain about scrip all the time - but it's just the 150 amount which is basically nothing each day(haha just kidding, it's not each day. it's 150 total and each time you take from it that amount gets added back 20 hours later. Not a day. 20 hours. or some shit like that, who knows?)  
---
I would love a better place to put feedback for the devs and hope it gets read cause I imagine this subreddit is rife with complaints all the time. Just chalk me up as another player who isn't pleased! Whether I get Scrip weekly, daily, or every 20 hours.
---
Put em in iceboxes they r the most secure but they will fuck up once in awhile
---
You learn weapon plans which will allow you to craft the base version of that weapon, no legendary effects applied.
---
Only a handful of plans, which require endgame content earned through completing wastelander‚Äôs main quest will allow you to craft legendary items. All other legendaries can only be found through gameplay!
---
No, I become very overencumbered. Was screwed out of 2 queen fights yesterday trying to drop everything so I could fast travel. 
---
Can't even pick up food to eat immediately without holding the weight gain and preventing me from running/fast traveling.
---
yep, private world transfers are lies right now
---
Jeez, why do people enjoy ruining things for everyone? It's like that current ammo machine dupe thing, people aren't even scared of bans and their selfishness causes the devs to take actions that affect everyone. Stahp it people! Tired of being punished for other people's actions üò§ Anyway, thanks for responding, I figured that might be why we can't have them, however, I don't see why the mats can't be individual. If people want to be butts, they can see where people spawn in &amp; trap it without needing a FT mat so abolishing it accomplishes nothing really.
---
If I fast travel to a camp to do some shopping and end up at the bottom of a hill or cliff. I just fast travel to the same camp again and it always puts me right in the camp.
---
It loads very fast, way faster than the first try, and it's free.
---
The only downside or maybe upside depending how you look at it, is you may end up behind a locked door that the camp owner doesn't want you behind.
---
Make sure the bags of concrete are old and got wet so they're less bags of concrete and more...um...a rock in a bag.
---
Good I'm glad
---
This just in: more damage is worth it!
---
claiming them workshops is fun though, claim, hop, claim hop
---
Agreed! I liked the Responders a lot!
---
I was originally going to suggest having fallout fans be the ones to narrate the stories but figured it would take a lot to have to record multiple episodes and then update it on a biweekly/monthly/‚Äúhowever often they update‚Äù basis
---
I agree, though. Two is limiting the possibilities for gameplay
---
The best thing is to take all three, have a vampires gatling weapon, and when you eventually go down, don‚Äôt have anyone revive you until the last second because you‚Äôre still acting as a conduit in a downed state.
---
Well damn. I've never heard of anything that could cause this. Good luck!
---
Maybe they could rework it so either A) the mat has to be placed on terrain only and not foundation or floors ect. or B) if a person dies to your trap after fast traveling you become wanted
---
Not sure how realistic these solutions are though
---
Yes we did. Bethesda updates manually so if we didn‚Äôt get it till the last day we won‚Äôt see it actually completed.
---
Scroll down further on the event page and it will say unlocked on event items.
---
cork is also available from pipe guns....but is not required to craft them from what I am told
---
I'm totally wised up on cork mate. But  200 million ??? They'd be as well asking us for 200 million Deathclaws...
---
Fvckin madness. Will we have to wait until Friday before they adjust that ridiculous quota too ??!
---
I‚Äôll have to check it out, that sounds awesome. Thanks
---
I'm still confused.
---
If the nuke is placed well Harper's is great for flux.
---
buff garb of mystery (more tanky on par with Chinese stealth armor)  
---
some daily !  Christ its even in lore !!! (automatic system that not YET operational!)
---
this happened to me a lot, yelling at the sun doesn't help. I tried digging a hole with my face in my neighbor's yard, but it did nothing...
---
... giving up helps
---
Yea, the folks here are either folks in denial about the state of the game or die-hards with broken hearts who stick around cause they love Fallout too much. Or newbies who should get out of here and play something else.
---
True but how many times have players returned to the Appalachia radio station?
---
I'm in game now. camp is near the original overseers CAMP. if you could just jump off something and die and let me revive you I'd be a very grateful human.
---
Not at all. I was mostly pointing out that that‚Äôs what I do and it‚Äôs NOT a perfect Bloodied Melee compared to an all god roll Sniper.
---
then i just am garbage
---
Thanks. Even unequipped all my weight boosting perks and re-equipped them, got me 2lbs less than I was but still over. Definitely some kind of bug but idk how they managed to fuck it up for one person.
---
Another friend of mine can fast travel, but can't run or even walk normally, he's stuck at the snail pace. He doesn't show being over-encumbered at all.
---
Tony Heyward and Todd Howard sound eerily similar.
---
I mean have you met people?
---
But yeah, they can still easily make traps so it didn't solve the problem it was meant to. Love to see them put them back in. Could even do skins in the Atom shop!
---
Also if you have a bathroom put Toothpaste,toilet paper , plunger , toothbrush etc. Would be a nice touch
---
Once its safe to eat at places again, take a trip and eat at Bob's Shanghai 66 if you're going to drive that far anyway. I am also about 45 minutes away in the opposite direction.
---
Haha okay. I'll be there in a minute, sending friend request
---
It's excellent. Loads of stories and modern bands doing 50s style covers of modern songs as well.
---
Nuka World ads the lot !
---
At least in 76 there's always something to do, even if it's random encounters with enemies. Those spontaneous things don't even exist in RDO apart from the occasional wild animal or NPC you looked at wrong.
---
I play like 4 hours a day and never saw one if those in a workshop or camp lol
---
Whitespring spawns got nerfed some time ago. I like Morgantown for cobalt flux and mobs. Harper's Ferry has quite a bit of crimson and violet flux. There is a decent amount of cobalt and fluorescent spread out if you place the nuke well. You can also get glowing ghouls in the Burrows underground for xp but they don't drop flux stabilizing mats.
---
That doesn't seem to work at my own CAMP. The only time I spawn directly in it is if another player is already there. That seems to change where I spawn. I have anorher character with the same CAMP spot but I spawn only slightly down the hill. I would have to pick up my entire CAMP &amp; move it 2 feet back just to change where I currently spawn. Seems a lot of effort. A FT mat would be such a delight &amp; far easier. ü§ì
---
Yeah, not expecting anything concrete to happen, but wanted to add my voice to the chorus.  I'm so glad BETH took the time to "fix" issues with CAMP building, but not this.   
---
/sarcasmOff
---
Probably 'easiest' method would be to require it to snap to the outside of the green build zone wall and require it to be on ground. All wishful thinking most likely.
---
just lost 350 scrip worth o legendaries :(
---
If you do it right, FSP can get you both the Queen &amp; Colossus....though since the drops are mostly trash, it's an exercise in futility.
---
This is something that is mostly forgotten about the BoS, because most folks only experience is with 3 and 4, or the DC splinter group.  Maybe we'll have another undocumented splinter group, but why they would even keep the moniker this early on is beyond me.
---
We're dealing with the early BOS.  The one that will pry your pip boy out of your cold dead hands, because you can't be trusted with it.  And, uh *checks notes*, we haven't been angels.
---
Cant find your name. You can try to add me. Its &lt;ayes23&gt;
---
I‚Äôm not seeing a link?
---
Ok that helps a lot, I have been checking random encounter spots, server hopping etc, but didn't know about the sluggish sloth.
---
Yes! That would actually be cool! I'd like one that says "got taco's? or something...
---
If only they didn't need a community to tell them obvious things. :P
---
Maybe in a few more years they'll even be able to produce a working text chat, so we can actually write 'sorry' instead of emoting it!
---
It still isn't there unfortunately.
---
6000 for me plus the repeatable.
---
I've been on my private server for about 30 mins now and there's not been a single bit of lag and no server not responding messages 
---
HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!
---
Never seen any, on PC
---
thank you! Perfect for work!
---
If you've already gotten the Chinese Stealth Armor, I'd recommend going with the Raiders.
---
10,000 concrete i donated they even lowered the cap we were a 100,00 shy and now all we got was a FUCKING SORRY EMOTE
---
IDK why people get so bent about this. nobody is forced to shop player vendors, Walking is free, fast travel is your choice. If it ain't your flavor don't eat it.
---
Boost your intelligence as high as you can with a berry mentats chem for a +5 INT boost, and scorchbeast brain for a +5 INT boost, I think brainfungus has a +4 INT boost, and it gets doubled if you are carnivore or herbivore depending which you got, hop into a public building team and get that max +4 INT bonus, and THEN scrap your radium rifles all at once that you've collected. The higher your INT, the higher chance you scrapping a weapon results in learning a mod for free.
---
Ill give it a try
---
That is just weird. You mind if I ask what platform you play on? pleasedontbexboxpleasedontbexboxpleasedontbexboxpleasedontbexboxpleasedontbexbox
---
Mmmmm. Tacos...
---
Dammit, now I'm hungry!
---
I'd forgotten about just how many handmades you can get off the cultists...
---
So "water" is not the term used for fluid monohydrogendioxyde? I actually do not know, and will Google it because it's interesting.
---
Edit: "Water" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard ambient temperature and pressure. It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds are formed from suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.
---
Golf balls seem to be the only reliable source I've found. Surely there's something else? I had tons of steel just laying around, and took the time to farm concrete, knowing it was coming, but cork is another beast altogether. Anyone have any pointers?
---
It's an online game, surely the radio channels could be streamed and regularly chopped and changed..? Different stories on different weekdays, serials...interviews with 'The People of Appalachia'...üòÑ
---
Could be outstanding. Imagine Ward being interviewed on Whitesprings 18th hole discussing his handicap, while settlers scream in the background trying to deal with getting rushed by the Golf Club ferals...all the while the host getting more and more nervous...üòÅ
---
I been sitting at 100 for about a week now. Just waiting in the next on tbh
---
6 Teddies one display plus some other nice glowing items, glowing blood, high radiation fluid, quantum in the second.
---
i hate all of you they gave us the sorry emote so you can apologize to the people who were trying
---
I liked maxing the raider rep first for the ammo machine. The gauss shotgun is available from the Settlers and the gauss minigun from the raiders once you hit max rep. Other than those three items, it's just preference.
---
üí™the superior builds
---
Disappointment
---
‚ÄúHey you got fast traveling to work!‚Äù
---
And of course, a week later the plans still are not in the game.
---
it's so you can apologize to the players who were donating when all of you said lets see what happens if we don't donate
---
Bahaha PS4
---
I can't get the pass thru power connector to work with them.  Really wish I could get power into my military tent in an orderly fashion.
---
Lots of folks have moved them underground to keep from being reported.
---
What economy? lol. Ammo has been duped into the millions quite a few times. Let the workshop Chad's farm, it's still work.
---
FSP?
---
And you can get plenty of plasma guns off of Blood Eagles.
---
Fissure Site Prime
---
*Please assume the position*
---
I have just been dumpin' all of my mounted head plans in the river, and other plans at the OG overseers camp. I haven't missed them one bit.
---
Because the brotherhood are stuck up egotistical maniacs
---
Just because one is worse, it doesn't make the other good. One is a complete shitshow, the other a complete shitshow on fire. One is worse, but they are both absolute shit. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy it or that you should feel bad for enjoying it, to each their own, but the sooner we can all agree on the fact they're both shit, the sooner they may either improve and become halfway passable, or get abandoned. The former, preferably. Got both games as a pre-order and have played both RDO and F76, both pre, and post Wastelanders and they are both completely abysmal. The foul stench of greed just lingers even after a proper bath. Both me and my wife enjoyed both, to a certain extent, but at some point you just gotta take that step back and reevaluate. Both are completely indefensible. Great ideas and potential, but the worst execution imaginable. If I wouldn't know better I'd claim they oughtta be ashamed, but deep down we all know these companies are long dead and rotten.
---
I hit 100 during the DXP weekend then didn't play at all for 3 weeks. It was totally the right decision and the break was great. I only started playing again because I had a hankering for rebuilding my camp with the new junk walls.
---
Pipe weapons give cork, so head to the penitentiary, grafton, grafton steel, Morgantown.  Loot the pipe guns and use the scrapper perk.  Low level super mutants seem to drop pipe guns a lot.
---
Edit: 
---
Just wanted to clarify that I checked while scrapping and the scrapper perk does not seem to give any additional cork, they will only give one per.
---
I‚Äôve seen this more than once recently, and what little desire I currently had to log in has been further cut in half because I don‚Äôt bother using my alt anymore. If I get chance I get on get my scrip and gold and leave now. 
---
It‚Äôs my bloodied weapon storage on my alt, and I‚Äôm not risking it. Raise awareness.
---
Yo this is clean. I like that a lot.
---
How long is the scarecrow in the shop? I couldn‚Äôt see it, but the others are all there long enough for me to get them. On a beach vacation at the moment until Thursday, and wondering if I have time to get it.
---
worked fine for me yesterday, but today i lost 300 scrip
---
craft tons of level 1 pipe pistols withe super duper, and then scrap them with the scrapper perk and you'll get cork much faster
---
Actually, "water" is the name for the liquid state of h2o
---
Why did they nerf Whitesprings? We need *more* good places to nuke, not fewer. Thanks for reminding me about Morgantown. I've done that before, but it's been ages. I think I'll do Harper's in the future because of the Burrows but I hear your point about stabilizing mats. 
---
It just seems that they could make small tweaks to improve the nuke locations. Flowers are wonderful and all, but I don't want to wander around a nuke zone and rarely encounter enemies. I'm looking for a little spice here. lol
---
This would enrage everyone there. So yeah...
---
On the other hand I think its funny so thumbs up from me
---
Sooo you know this game is made in texas right?
---
Have you tried to do them?  Supposedly you can still complete them as part of the new finagling the did with the patch as that has been indicated from daily posts here.
---
Some people are in popular spots and sell water. I lock all but one.
---
I think they do it a bit in ESO. The trick is that when you come to certain areas there are changes in what's rendered depending on the player. For example - player A sees all the settlers and can talk with them, player B sees only corpses and cannot talk with them.
---
It's not a huge thing, you couldn't make too big of a change, but it would be enough to allow for serious consequences for player actions.
---
Any specific suggestions?
---
Ps4 why ?
---
Fantastic. That makes it easier.
---
I hope so too !
---
Sleep in a tent and have someone move it, then you can cosplay as a whitesprings ghoul!
---
I still like Whitespring just to go knocking heads around in the golf club. Haven't seen anyone hit Harper's Ferry in a while, but that used to make the Burrows glow and was fun for a bit.
---
I didn't mention that as I figured doing it was a given at this point.  
---
I'll be trying to sing the theme to "My Favorite Martian" while gargling aquarium water next.
---
I get an error message a lot when I transfer but I just join again and all the stuff is still there. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the same error you are talking about though.
---
Does it do it without the scrapper perk?
---
they also don't take any cork to craft so you can just make tons of them with super duper
---
When it comes to Fallout 76, Bethesda has issues with not fucking up the duffle bag.
---
Strange. I can't check the stats right now, but I'm pretty sure that I hung up my 50 because my new lever did more damage..
---
Checks personal notes.....4 nukes launched at atlas since sunday....gonna go with they ain't fans.
---
Probably 22 or 23 at the rate they're going.
---
If you're lucky
---
Don‚Äôt you mean seppuku?
---
This is really cool good job mate.
---
Yep typo
---
From what I'm seeing it's only when you have the Scrapper perk card and it is also apparently a bug.
---
Yeah - straight out trying to gun down those with the most access to nuclear weapons seems a really really bad idea.
---
CrumbBum3857, can craft and mod many items if you ever need any!  Good karma In the trading sub so I‚Äôm a reliable smith :) 
---
Glad you‚Äôre enjoying the game!
---
I always hover over the zipper on the top, not defending the size of the hit box just pointing out the hovering over the zipper sort of makes sense
---
There's a Mothman Cult fast travel point just south of the "small camp." I think it's called Sacrament. If you run over to the fort from Crater, you can just FT for a cap and save some time.
---
Or just get a jetpack and go over the top. That's what I do, now that I got my weightless SS chest that I just carry for the jetpack.
---
Have you applied the bugged skin to your CAMP device?
---
We can't know until later
---
I have seen some. Fix it Bethesda!
---
+karma
---
Good to know!
---
It appears that we might not get any "fixes" before patch 22...which totally blows, since BGS broke several things which should never had happened.
---
It is quite a welcome change that enemies use such a diverse array of weapons and armor now, it used to not be that easy. Previously you had to craft and scrap high tier weapons such as lever action and handmade to learn plans. Crowned enemies and "end of dungeon" chests would also have these items on rare occasion.
---
Exploiters screwing up the game for the rest of us. Report people you see doing this, please.
---
Haha for real. That‚Äôs all this game is now. It‚Äôs like Safe Space 76. Nothing but people building cute little camps and collecting cosmetic junk. I like to role play as a blood eagle or raider and terrorize people. I went to some players camp and they had a settler NPC right by the house digging a hole with a shovel. I executed him right in front of the camp owner. Then they immediately left the server.
---
sounds good! i'll shoot you a message sometime soon as well
---
Well then, you better start solving it or you'll be in trouble.
---
Hence the term "Community Event" =)
---
People were farming legendaries, xp and nuke mats faster than they liked I guess. If you nuke Harper's try to hit the Red Rocket Station to the south and the farm house and power substation to the northwest. The Red Rocket spawns ghouls, mutants or scorched. The farm house is a random spawn but has more flux and mobs for mats. The substation and Red Rocket will occasionally spawn legendary enemies. There is also the random spawn chance for the Sheepsquatch near the train station. I will usually run the look up top and then go into the Burrows.
---
Absolutely nothing üòâ, but you can put it in your scrap box!
---
Line in the Sand  
---
Crop dusting SB downs a bloodied with the DoT.
---
Bloodied goes to revive, revives but downs the reviver (me).
---
Gets revived by another bloodied, and they go down.
---
Was a funny circle of revives
---
What is kind of funny about this is I use an IBM Quick3270 terminal daily (Green screens) and feel right at home in the ammo vendor, tab is back in both Fallout and Green Screens lol. I don't mind it as much as other people but I can definitely see how it would be upsetting to most people.
---
I play both sides so I always...have something to play
---
It doesn‚Äôt take up any space?
---
I used to farm materials by getting a high bounty and waiting on people to come kill me only for me to destroy them. Just throw on a full set of assassins gear. You‚Äôd be surprised how many people carry about bulk junk on them.
---
So we aren't getting the BOS banner? If so then Bethesda needs to reconsider.  They have already pissed a lot of people off with the camp building changes. They are in no position to test the community's patience any further.
---
Infinite capacity with F01 scrap box
---
I thought this at first, but nobody is duping concrete and cork. If they were trying to thin out duper's scrapboxes, they would have done flux, lead, steel, copper, acid, plastic, etc. The only two items that have been heavily duped are also easily enough obtained to hit goal without dupers' assistance.  Also, if that was their intention, they would kinda be encouraging duping. 
---
It was more likely an attempt at getting fallout first subscriptions up in the lead up to the start of the event.
---
Illuminati confirmed
---
no. everyone but you.
---
Hopefully they will do more with them at some point.  Eventually we run out of things to buy with bullion but will keep getting notes from public events.
---
Would be pretty neat if they opened up a proper currency exchange down in the vault where you can trade bullion for scrip, caps, fuzzy tokens, claim tickets, whatever BOS will make us use, etc, etc.
---
Oh, thanks
---
Thanks again so much for your help, I really appreciate it. If you ever need a favor, let me know!

...there you go mate. Loads of different 'stations' in there. Just have a rake...the Hubris(sponsors) one is the one station with all the drama stuff woven through it.
---
[This is the specific channel... ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxH73sGgO5g)
---
Non automatic, for one.
---
I remember beta, you couldn't go near a town without it sounding like a warzone.
---
they said this when the event started these are one time items and the camp system didn't change it works the same way
---
South Sudan.
---
You in power armor? If so try leaving it
---
Can we get an "degenerates Like You Belong on a cross emote" next
---
Last night my buddies and I developed our new gaming mantra:  Whatever isn't broken.
---
out load?
---
Maybe offtopic, but since people talking about emotes, I dunno why they changed team up emote logo with some photo emote. People never understand it and start posing for photo mode instead of joining the group
---
Try it with the fish, I tried it without and it didn't work.
---
Do you have a reliable enemy source for lever rifles? I'd be interested in grinding for those as well.
---
No sudoku is better
---
Not exactly sure, why don't you test it out and report back? You seem to know what this glitch is and how to activate/deactivate it. I'm too lazy to strip down before entering power armor.
---
First, they need to fix the wallpaper / wall glitch.
---
Ha!
---
Twist: it was added to sarcastically convey their regret about being managed by people that are complete dogshit at their job
---
I had that problem too.
---
You can get around by hooking up a "connector facing upwards" conduit on the roof to a "connector facing downwards" conduit, and then you'll just have the little connector poking through the roof.
---
Looks much neater than the pass through.
---
we finished concrete. But there is some in Blackwater mine.
---
What?
---
On paper damage only. Broadsider is broke AF.
---
Lol tbf it was like 4 in the morning
---
If you are looking for it to donate we have passed that phase.  If you are looking for it just to farm a bunch there is a link that is going around called "Where to farm:  All the things."  You can probably search for it.
---
How about ‚Äúno voice chat what the hell are you trying to say???‚Äù
---
Agreeded it‚Äôd be nice but clearly ESO has more people working on it / money put into it haha, I love eso they honestly made a nice lore game into a good MMO I love the questing and environments
---
You can also get cork from globes, baseballs, and crystal decanters, but those are all less widely available than golf balls.
---
It‚Äôs happened twice now where I‚Äôve put well over 3000 scrip into a container, and the message pops up while trying to log back into private (the world has timed out) but when I load in they‚Äôre still there. I know one day my luck will run out but so far my losses were about two legendarys and a bunch of worthless plans. 
---
Better to be safe then sorry tho, good heads up.üëç
---
Up to you. Scrap box, private server, fast travel tent, a little more reliability in being able to purchase atomic items. Just depends if those are worth $100/year to you
---
Bounties are only cleared by dying to another player in Fallout 76. Most Adventure Mode players absolutely *hate* all forms of PVP and thus will hate anyone that decides to try force them into engaging with it, or pester others until they do engage in it.
---
Im waiting for state trooper pa skin, looks very cool. And 3rd person is good for using Gatling gun, since iron sight is shit
---
That‚Äôs kind of a ‚Äúyou‚Äù decision. A lot of people buy for one month, spend the month grinding scrap, and then don‚Äôt use it again.
---
I personally love it for the scrap box.  I really don't play on private worlds but they are handy for moving stuff between alts if you don't know folks who play the game.
---
I like the monorail elevator
---
I'd love to see some focus on new factions. The BoS has been beaten to death. A Vault-Tec faction would be amazing. Would kinda be like the Institute in FO4, every other faction hates them, they have awesome, scientific tech, and have a pristine underground base. I would go all in on that for sure.
---
Assuming you play the game, yes
---
Yeah, 
---
According to [this source](https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/fallout-76-player-count#:~:text=At%20the%20time%20of%20this,million%20copies%20sold%20at%20launch.), u/itscmillertime is pretty far of base.
---
u/giantpunda, what was your point again? Oh, right.
---
Well you can get a discount at the wayward and polly‚Äôs old head but you can also get the free radicals mask and not be attacked by the raiders when you go to WV Lumber Co.
---
I'm dubious about the numbers, not like there's any actual logs that are visible to the public to show that people actually donated the last bit to complete.
---
If the community fails these challenges, it's a sign that Bethesda doesn't get their community. And they probably don't want to have that PR nightmare to deal with.
---
I don't care what they said. They wanted  us to farm something that was not on the map to be farmed.  It's penalizing the community for not producing something that could not be produced.
---
Refrigerated backpack, too.
---
You'r welcome glad to help :))
---
The world of Red Dead Online is beautiful, and I love the 1900's clothing, but it also feels empty and cold, Fallout feels more alive even if it's not the best experience. Also I hate having to be forced to play with others in quests, specially when theres griefers all around.
---
Lol idk if that matters but I do feel my mule lags hard when I enter his inv.
---
No, they are things like "Level up three times", ie, gonna take a few days to do.  I'm not hopeful, but will keep an eye on them to see if I do get credit.
---
Well where I live it‚Äôs $15 dollars so I went off that but still it should be way higher
---
Copy the url and then paste *that* into a new page.
---
Yes, but just for the lolz they will then make SS limbs unmodifiable.
---
I'll look into that I've been needing to fast-travel to the fort and go from there
---
i gave 10,000 literally years worth of concrete
---
I thought it'd be fun to try. Haven't had a chance to use it yet.
---
Thats actually what i wanted to do lmao.
---
That fixed it. Thanks.
---
I pretty much gave up on it lol
---
You will need a suitable Hill to perform that glitch!
---
Or Fastnacht
---
Same. I like to imagine that at some point, somebody at Bethesda argued "nobody's going to wear a mask that just covers their nose and mouth", and then 2020 came around and here we are.
---
I think mine's 33% extra vats hit, I haven't had a chance to test it yet.
---
I wish they would add more none pristine stuff. I don't like my camp looking like there isn't, you know, an apocalypse that happen.
---
Valentine was crazy back then. Part of me misses it because I barely see people at all now, feels super empty.
---
I should check my harpoon...
---
I have hit 100 today but I've been winding down to the daily grind, nice to have newish rewards for quests but I did fully flush out my dailies for the first time in 400 levels the other day and now they're piling back up 
---
Back on the Legendary Scrip Reroll wheel, I got my full 3\* Uny SS set with a mishmash of extras but a nice balance and my Bloodied Gauss Shotgun/Minigun w/ OK secondary effects, but the shotgun could do with something other than 40% bashing and I might go for some +1 int Armor, but just stockpiling to roll some legendary tenderizers some day.
---
I don‚Äôt think my estimates were that far off base :-/ lol. Either way, way over 100k daily players!
---
After like 2 days in game I subbed. As long as I play I'm not turning off. 100% worth it for me .
---
yep, you probably should \^\^
---
I hate it when companies try to make money too. Bastards.
---
I really wish they would offer "fixed" versions of all these appliances. We have this fridge with a pristine shine, but the door and bottom panel are broken.
---
I dont have alts and the whole private world thing is kinda useless for me. But the scrap box is a thing that i would love.
---
Another camp needs your help. I've marked it on your map.
---
I think they did that so you don't spawn in and die...  Move your actual C.A.M.P item you place when starting camps around it changes the fast travel spot.  It's kinda finicky
---
I WISH it worked, at all. If it even hurt enemies I would always have one on me. I keep a quad ffr, and a bloodied 90%reduced weight, just praying they fix them someday.
---
Im on ps4 Why ?
---
Don't die in the air, it's even more of a pita.
---
You get one coral for scrapping them, but spend two screws for crafting them. 
---
Even if Super Duper procced 100%, trading 1 Screw for 1 Cork isn‚Äôt a good idea in my opinion. 
---
Cork is easier to find than Screws and far less valuable overall.
---
Very nice
---
Also we aren't getting enough free atoms anymore.
---
Now the Atoms that we get from the battle-pass are used to buy BP-tiers instead of atmo shop stuff...
---
Because I‚Äôm waiting for friends to get on.
---
we'll donate 2.99 million and suddenly the goal will be 3 million just like that!
---
Just your server shutting down. Every server resets after it‚Äôs been online for a long time.
---
Oh duh. I was thinking Rifleman.
---
Just a server reboot. Happens all the time.
---
Golfballs are a more efficient way of grinding cork
---
i would wait untill the game is in a better situation the recent updates were...lacking
---
Gener...erh...Knight!  Another military installation needs our help!  Here, I marked it on your map.
---
That would honestly be hilarious, just have Garvey senior be a member of the Appalachian expedition who, while observing the labors of the Vault 76ers.  He has an epiphany that employing Vault Dwellers to complete tasks ensures the tasks get done for no pay and trivial rewards such as paint schemes.
---
He decides the BoS is for chumps and walks to Boston to make a fortune.  There, he creates an organization utilizing his philosophy of exploiting vault dwellers for free aid, the Minutemen.  He taught everything he knew to his son, Preston, who in turn taught everything he knew to his son, Preston, who in turn taught everything he knew to his son, Preston.
---
Is there anything similar or anything thatll add a bit more survivalbility i can swap for?
---
Its great.  What I did before I got it was take ALL the scrap out of my stash and see how much space I was going to save.  With with minimal scrap in the box it was still a TON of room that I was going to save.
---
That make it worth it.  You can get it for a month or two and then just farm like a mad person and then let it lapse and pick it up again later if you need it.
---
Brilliant great story
---
This is my new go to spot. Lots of Cobalt and plenty of enemies.
---
The keys will still work depending on how much FPS you are currently rendering too, I found I had to look at more complex parts of the room before it would let me move again. As soon as you look at the floor though, you can‚Äôt move because your FPS shoots way up.
---
Then they go through their "I'm a badass" teenager years where they get quite dickish... be ready for that :D then they'll be on the level.
---
hotfix is rolling out
---
That won't help if you can't get back in your world.
---
Add golf balls to your grinding, the Morgantown highschool Gym has like 100 or something
---
I see it occasionally, but its usually some obscure time like 4am (when there's only a couple of people on tat particular server.)
---
yeah i was thinking about waiting for the second season and BOS thingy.
---
I'm thankful to receive a free "So sorry" emote another one for the collection but the way they did the Angry Fist Shake, it's unnecessary to thing to do.
---
Now if it was part of an emote bundle like the Christmas one then I wouldn't be upset since I'd be getting a few or lot of emotes. But this bundle is not worth it if your buying it just to nab the emote, if you want to run around with a colander over your face I'm all for it and it looks great followed by the nest. The totem..
---
Is alright
---
I‚Äôm rank 98 and I‚Äôve yet to do any of the daily and weekly challenges yet today, Once I do them after I get back from the store I‚Äôll probably be done with the legendary run... Thank god it‚Äôs over.
---
I will say the tent is nice. It seems it can be placed in a lot of places that a camp cannot because the smaller footprint.
---
I live in Germany myself the minimum wage here is at 9,35‚Ç¨ so \~11$ and I would definitely say that's way too low but the effective value depends on prices in your area so I can't really asses the situation in america, not unlikely it's at least just as bad though so I am inclined to agree with you.
---
And one thing Bethesda does which is kind of a scam is, they also have 100 atoms cost 1‚Ç¨ so you literally save money by just buying with another currency, with this challenge I feel like they should've either made it a "multi-stage" thing where you get a decent amount of atoms at 76h, 760h and so on or a repeatable one giving some atoms every 76h of game-time
---
Personally i bought one month, i use the scrap box every second i can so at the end i could end up saving for months of junk, and the tent comes in handy to saving a few caps. The ATX rewards are good too, the price is mostly for the atoms you get, which is also a good thing considering you save money. In my opinion, it's really worth it.
---
Fissure site prime I assume
---
If this happens by accident I just drop whatever legendary I got from it, doesnt help more than one person but hey... Yeah always use a low damage weapon as your 2nd quickswap for events like that
---
You gotta find the last placed machine to interact with the terminal
---
Like my private server that was only up for 2 hours?
---
You know something? I can't remember ever being dc/d from my private server. I use it frequently too for farming fusion cores and ammo materials. Very interesting.
---
I'm assuming they will come with the release of finalized patch for Colossal problem, maybe next week, maybe next month
---
You should advocate for Wndigos.
---
You can be the FO76 version of Jane Badall from FO: Tactics.

I have a baby blue one and a pink one, both came modded as bladed, both have no color in the name. So is my blue one not rare?
---
Everyone says that but where is it exactly?
---
You give Bethesda too much credit.
---
Maybe you could do Remote Play from your phone.
---
Yeah these seen to be scarce as hell
---
God I would love for this place to be more positive, thanks for at least trying.
---
It also takes up build space in your CAMP budget, so you're encouraged to buy Fallout 1st to increase your CAMP budget. Wait, does Fallout 1st even do that? Seems my CAMP budget is pretty tiny and people that obviously have Fallout 1st have huge CAMPs, but maybe that's my imagination.
---
The real problem is that Bethesda thinks this fun.
---
I was gonna say this
---
But is it free AND permanent? Or will it be a temporary thing that only a few people can claim and then be exclusive to people who only got it in this window? 
---
Better hope not the latter, otherwise that'd be pretty dumb and so would Bethesda.
---
You can sever hop to pick up more scrap from the purveyor
---
Oh, I know. My point was that you were actually hella conservative with your numbers, that source says 400k across all platforms 
---
I just found it amusing that you did all of that math, only to be told that you have no idea what you're talking about because you didn't provide an actual source stating 100k. So I provided one, that was 4x that number; while dickwad up there was scoffing at 100k.
---
It's near Fort Defiance and Lucky Hole Mine.
---
The concrete bags are at the top of the downhill elevator (there's 2).
---
Mind the gap, it's a long fall.
---
Maybe they could replace bashing with alt fire gun modes, such as fan fire revolvers, burst fire for auto weapons, maybe punch-through rifle rounds and shotgun slugs. And have activating alt fire use some AP for balance and/or an alternative to V.A.T.S.
---
Last week when there was a shut down imminent warning they were doing a hot fix for the Charleston mine bug. Hopefully it‚Äôs just them fixing issues quickly.
---
Second story of the sorority house, there is a chess set made outta those little guys.
---
I‚Äôd love to have the Marksmen Carbine as a bullion weapon, basically an AR15 that fires 5.56 and has tons of customization options.
---
The RU556 Assault Rifle mod from Fallout 4 would be a good example.
---
(Matter of fact I‚Äôd be happy if the author of that mod would sell it to Bethesda just so I can have my favorite rifle mod in 76.)
---
Well guess ill be keeping the majority of my fo1st atoms this week...i already have 75% of the stuff thats ‚Äúnew‚Äù
---
  Yes, to learn mods - which can significantly increase damage dealt by weapons or maybe just increase their range, ammo capacity, or accuracy.
---
 or increase DR, RR, or ER on your armor.  
---
For example, the alloyed mod for L50 metal armor increases DR of the  (heavy) chest piece from its default 86 to 117.  Or use the lead lined mod for more RR, deep pocketed for +10 carry weight, ad nauseum.
---
And those mods work on both normal and legendary armor or weapons.
---
Plus there are atom challenges for learning X number of plans/mods.
---
Thank you for the recommendation üòä ‚ò∫ üòÄ. 
---
I just got it fixed
---
Cheers y'all
---
When you inspect the weapon, does the paint job say blue or indigo? If it says indigo then it is the rare one, it does look blue-ish :) If it says blue, then that is one of the colors you can mod yourself, so not so rare [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Baseball\_bat\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Baseball_bat_(Fallout_76))
---
Finally! Now, if we could only get  middle finger &amp;  exploding nuke emotes I'd be content. I do a lot of silo runs, so it'd be nice to let the other people around me that they shouldn't leave the server just yet.
---
If changing servers dont do it you probably have to rebuild then. Sorry, its all I can think of.
---
1850 less atoms.
---
Homer fist emote ftw!
---
This one looks like a hotfix. Normal server shutdown is 15min and just says it's shutting down. This one was 5min and said change server for update.
---
It's the same bs with a little more bs and now some limited time bs. I really wanted the the Raider Cage and Fireflies, but I can't.
---
Ahhh.  Waste of a fusion generator, it was
---
wasn't the bomber jacket back a few weeks ago? I think it was part of the military week.
---
Thank you! Will check this evening.
---
I'm mad I was 170 levels in before my dumb ass realized I could change my hair color üòÇ
---
Were you in or using power armor today directly before, during, or after the reset?
---
Lifesaver, thank you fam.
---
just oh my god. yas bethesda. 
---
either you give us nothing or you give us everything at once and DRAIN OUR ATOMS! we stan. thank you, this is an awesome update all around imo.
---
Thank you :)
---
The tracker still says 4.65 million for me, how are y‚Äôall seeing this?
---
Ugh that sucks man I'm sorry üòñ
---
Im just pissed I lost 8 workshops. Wouldn't be an issue if the promised feature to retain workshops on a private server had actually been delivered.
---
something in there might need some power to operate......
---
try temp turning off all mission markers except that one.
---
I thought that was only if we meet the cork goal
---
Nope. If people can't take it, they shouldn't dish it. I feel that new gun is fair payment for putting up with that bullshit.
---
private worlds are just servers that happen to be empty when you log in. so, yes.
---
Such BS and they have no fix for this, very frustrating
---
You can power 5 per generator, but only the last placed one lets you interact with the terminal, and all machines will make the same ammo
---
What sort of idiot would waste all those screws for some cork?
---
I know but you can only find so many in one day
---
Nah actually I got it i logged in this morning to see it back all 3k caps so thats nice atleast glad it basically erased my dumb ass mistake
---
Whatever sounds good to you!
---
Wish they‚Äôd add more dance emotes to flash in front of people without 1st cause ‚ÄúSo sorry‚Äù
---
I mean technically we never joined the BoS, we just got around their grid wall security by a loophole lol
---
Weird tower thing on the edge of the bog
---
There was a new aviator jacket but I don't remember the original one, the one that was there from the start of the game. Maybe it's called something else and I'm wrong with the name, tho.
---
The thing about gold bars is they are surprisingly easy to grind. Lack of monetization is probably why RDO gets so little love compared to GTAO.
---
can you bulk the ones you have?
---
Bulk, scrap the bulk, repeat until you hit the required number.
---
The idiot that gets too many, I'm sorry you don't have the amount to waste. :P
---
More like grind squared now with the Legendary Ruin
---
Fairs, just wanted to make sure if there was any that I need to get
---
Hahaha. He seems to just like to troll.
---
golfballs are limited.... you can only find so many in one day this is endless. thanks though
---
That's not what people were saying when 1st launched when people complained enemies weren't spawning believing it was a recycled server.
---
Last week they were running a hot fix for the Charleston mine bug. Thats why people lost their worlds and couldn‚Äôt get their gear back. I think the same is happening today. Maybe for the smiley bug yesterday or something else.
---
You saw a chance and you took it, but at what cost...
---
That is just one of many quests related to the sheepsquatch. 
---
Have you started the Van lowe questline? That one you mentioned is one of the 6 (I think) side quests beyond the primary Van Lowe taxidermy quest.
---
Well, made 99 and 100 today. the lv99 is just an ordinary door in my opinion. but it looks nice. i will definetily take a breake... was just.... TO much. :-/
---
I'm not entirely sure if they've set up the Enclave to be the morally ambiguous faction in this one. Who was the guy in the military during the Wastelanders questline that said that MODUS sounded "like \[pop culture character that I forget\] except obviously evil"?
---
I mean you left the question a little too vague, if you aren‚Äôt sure where to start maybe start with a newbie guide on YouTube.
---
 But the game let‚Äôs you go at your own pace, you don‚Äôt have to decide how you want to play right away
---
I think your assumptions are correct, probably we'll get 2 bonus daily challenges. This are just my thoughts, Bethesda hasn't specified nothing more as I'm aware of. (Sorry for bad English I probably messed up the last sentence)
---
Right... Yay, they provided basic functionality 2 years after launch. I'm glad it's here, but I'm still peeved we've gotten a damn Mothman Dance before we could get basic communication.
---
Yeah I just did that D:
---
Gotta rebuild my Club again
---
So more bs to try and force you log in daily? Ok thanks.
---
As a fellow German, I agree.
---
Go to the wayward. Look behind the counters. Collect hot plates, typewriters, fans
---
Probably not, but Bethesda wouldn't admit it.
---
What‚Äôs legendary ruin? Haven‚Äôt kept up with the game for a while now.
---
Get out of here stalker
---
I think its based off of a real cryptid story in our world. Im not too sure of things passed that.
---
Yep the only paint that is legacy is the Initiate paint
---
What is cork even used for outside of camp building? Am I just dumb or something cause I've never seen it anywhere besides junk.
---
No, it's not normal. You got lucky :)
---
Managed to transfer stuff no problem yesterday via Sutton lockers, but thanks for the warning. Maybe currently issues are possible.
---
Yes! Evil begets evil. Now you are a scammer. Anyway you cut it you are no better than the person you scammed.
---
If he‚Äôs a CC then he should know what are the repercussions of even play scamming.
---
I should have paid more attention to the storyline instead of just caring about leveling.
---
Exact same thing happened to me. 3 of my daily's also autocompleted.
---
I suggested this in another topic, but they could let us donate in variables of like 50, 100, or so. Those amounts, especially for materials not as readily available to all, would make it easier for everyone to donate, and if it's an issue with giving out provision boxes just make sizes like all the other loot boxes like this were. A small for 50, a medium for say 100 or 150, and a large for 250.
---
Very fair lol
---
So for anyone that didn‚Äôt know you can buy all stuff separate or in a blood eagle bundle for 1200 and comes with the outfit and other cool stuff. I bought the bundle being I had 1500 left over and I will get my fallout first 1800 tomorrow.
---
Soooo basically you want zero consequence to dying?
---
Pro-tip: don‚Äôt carry hours worth of junk on you.
---
Yes I alredy finished It but it looks that Sheepsquatch never exist before war and this Is a miscellaneous quest, not connected to the Van Lowe questline
---
Nuke LOS
---
What Is the real Story?
---
Oh you are kidding (face-palm)
---
depends on your enemy, your perks, whether you are scoped or hip firing, and mods on the rifle.
---
for example, 3\* AA Fixer vs 3\* supressors exploding lever.  Tank killer3 and Glowsight3 equipped.
---
Target: L40 glowing mole miner.  
---
AA Fixer, hip fire, detected.  85 dmg.
---
explosive supressor, hip fire, detected: 135 dmg
---
AA Fixer, scoped, sneak attack: 450 dmg
---
Explosive supressor, sneak attack : 250 dmg
---
Thanks for the opinion. I think you're right. I shouldn't have done it, but no doubt he deserved it. Whats a CC?
---
Honest question, how does it affect you?
---
hows that again?  
---

---
Not trade-able, but as previous comment stated you can server hop to buy more. The purveyor stock of vault steel and legendary modules refresh on each new server
---
&gt;There needs to be Atom Points rewards when you reach level 100 of a season
---
OMG this is such a stupid rule.  I'm legitimately making a suggestion and your rules engine is looking for ... in the title.  Pathetic.
---
soon!
---
not what who was saying? it was always known that adventure mode and private worlds use the same servers.
---
There's lots of bugs in game. Shotguns are bugged in vats and do alot more dmg than intended. Same with pipe pistols they can use rifle and pistol dmg perk cards for crazy dmg. When these bugs gets fixed they will be crap again unless they get buffed.
---
You literally typed everything I was going to type.
---
You on Xbox? I‚Äôll run it with tou
---
I use the vats matrix on helmet and the jet pack for chest and calibrated shocks for legs. I can‚Äôt remember if I have any for arms
---
You can't bulk screws.
---
Content creator.. youtuber, twitcher e.t.c
---
It was added at the same time and is connected to one of the CH monthly newsletters. It‚Äôs a side quest just like the one outside the motel in the mire (if you haven‚Äôt gone there yet, look for the note on the table outside near boomer)
---
ps4 unfortunately
---
Do you have a rough idea of what kind of weapons you enjoy using and see yourself using later in the game? I knew I wanted to use a shotgun so based my perks around that and then helpful things like lock picking:terminals:armour crafting etc. When I got to level 50, that‚Äôs when I starting playing around more with a build and altering my set up!
---
Legendary Run* free battle pass you have to complete challenges for. Would have been entirely different if it was event based.
---
Around Christmas, there were random scorched in Santa outfits and other Xmas apparel. You got a gift if you killed one, and they dropped from those. They're pretty common, but new people play all the time and don't have them. You're an example of that, and that's why I sell them really cheap.
---
Hell I'd give them to a new player, but randomly dropping them seems like such a waste. And if you price them at 0, someone will take all to sell themselves, or to dump so they don't exist.
---
i make lvl 20 fixers and put them in my shop for 200 caps just for low lvls to have a fixer.
---
Ah yes. Thank you!
---
Sorry bro. Wish I could help
---
I just realized I haven‚Äôt been looting golf balls and plastic stuff from whitesprings ever since I got Fallout 1st around March...
---
God I love the scrap box.
---
juat gotta log in and claim it before it goes away
---
Cause I did like 30 of these Forbidden Knowledge quests and never got jack. And the game suddenly gives me two in a row!
---
What type of build / weapons are u looking to get into???
---
Theres only a few that are probably must haves, rest all depend on build and playstyle. Look online for a build planner to assist. 
---
Things to consider:
---
1) Weapons you want to use - Unarmed, melee, pistols, shotguns, heavy, ect. - Only rank up the ones for your chosen weapon type.
---
2) Power armor or not - If going powered armor, some perks are useless that you would normally want as a non power armored player, such as marathoner.
---
I completely agree! Best part of the vanilla. In the whole game the only faction I like more is the Pioneer Scouts and that's only because they have cuter outfits.
---
I bet this is for the main quest line bug impacting new players
---
If you deserve one?
---
Yup me too. I kind of can't wait to hit 100 so I can stop playing for a bit.
---
Yep, commando and bloodied got a bit ignored so therefore rifleman as well. The low health sneak use of the weapons don't need much of a boost.
---
Because Gauss is being spread about between factions, I feel you are right to suspect we will see the new Gauss auto rifle show up at BOS as well as improvements for the rifle, like a large magazine and quick charge to lift DPS a bit.  I wouldn't hope for much as the bloodied FFR fixer is still most likely the best weapon in the game if you exclude ledgendary weapons.
---
You can try. I've sent 3 in over the past 2 months and only gotten an automated "we received your ticket" email. So I wouldn't get my hopes up
---
One of my 3 characters that I logged in today is in PA. I used him for about 15 minutes to scrip over an hour before reset. He was not the character I logged out last on nor logged in 1st on.
---
However, when I logged my main (non-PA and the last one to log out prior to the reset) back in after the reset, I could only see a 0/2 and a 0/5 for weekly/daily, and only the incomplete ones were listed in the menus. I switched to my PA guy and the lists changed to 4/8 and 3/9 completed, and I could see the auto-completed quests in the lists now.
---
This is bugged for me as well.  I cannot apply the camo paint to my EXISTING under armor.  I can make NEW camo under armor, but I cannot apply the shielding lining to it even though it appears as an option.  I sent it a report to Bethesda, they told me to make a video and send it to them, BLARG, seriously?  
---
The paint for the actual SS armor does work though.
---
Happened on the private I was on to, mentioned an update. Just one of those things I guess.
---
sudoku. its a puzzle. like, literally a puzzle. they're in newspapers next to the crosswards.
---
Or dual wield pistol plus one hand melee.
---
Explosive 10mm and ripper with jetpack power for that space marine glory

---
They fixed the smiley exploit
---
The story line for the order of mysteries was incredibly disappointing to me.
---
Currently I‚Äôm using an Anti Armour Suppressed Sniper as long range and then a Sharp black diamond(sword) as my close range, I want to get a better gun than my sniper though eventually, just not sure what I can get at my low level of 25
---
Time zones wouldn‚Äôt matter on a 24 hour update. We can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt fail any of the challanges.
---
Tell that to all the people that complained on this sub at launch and were told they were "fresh" servers. I'd love to know how it was "always known" since Bethesda didn't say squat and I've seen people talk about private servers having fewer cores than public servers which is the reason they can only handle a fraction of the players vs a public server.
---
They didn't blueprint the machine before the glitch got patched......
---
Its essentially like the regular Bigfoot story. It started in the mid to late 90s. Witness es described a large white thing, and in 2 cases attacks were reported. The most recent sighting was in 2015.
---
I know it sucks but it‚Äôs the consequence for carrying it around. If I die and someone takes my junk more power to them. I was the idiot walking around with it. I have also taken other players stuff. One time at the event with the burners I was playing and going around after event and looting all ghouls I killed. I see a bag laying there so I take it being I didn‚Äôt think anyone was coming for it. Well someone then proceeded to message me saying them and their friends where coming for me because I stole their junk. I said oh well you should‚Äôve scrapped it. So I see you get upset but I also see that if I have stuff I don‚Äôt want to lose I scrap box it before the event.
---
That's roughly where I place the nukes for both. [https://imgur.com/a/ha805xG](https://imgur.com/a/ha805xG)
---
If you nuke Harper's try to hit the Red Rocket Station to the south and the farm house and power substation to the northwest. Morgantown I just put the nuke edge just southwest of the train station. It has a chem bench so you can stabilize flux after picking. Markers are where I center the nuke.
---
How do I get that armor
---
I'm not looking for a money refund, just an atom refund. If I was to do a money one I would do a live chat support for my platform which in this case is Microsoft. Have done it before and everytime they refund the money I spent on atoms.
---
Go to Sugar Grover.  There are fans and globes there a plenty.
---
Sometimes you can also bulk screws and then scrap them and get credit.  That works for some junk but not all.
---
same im lvl 83 now only figuiring it out haha
---
You need to go through the Settler Quests. I think it‚Äôs the third or fourth one that sends you to a location where you can get the armor.
---
simon the life of the party
---
Oh also I saw a comment on a gauss shotgun do I buy it or do I get it for free
---
I'm swimming in screws so hasn't been a problem for me, but whatever way to get cork is best for you go for it
---
just was contributing what works for me
---
thanks, i‚Äôm just ranting tho because this game likes to play with my emotions
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423294/fallout-76-hotfix-no-downtime-august-11-2020?language%255B%255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en
---
It was a hotfix
---
So you want to invest in perception. Specifically commando if u are going for a rifle build.
---
And luck to you invest in vats...
---
Ah yes i forgot the CH, i Remember that in the motel question explain that the wendigo are cannibals mutated by Radiation
---
I bought a plan just so i could make-&gt;scrap them for mods, hoping a get a decent 3* legendary roll one of these days
---
I'm sure it's intentional to make sure people can't steal from a loot bag you are standing on, like the paper bag. It sucks and I would love it fixed but I don't think it will be.
---
It's kinda sad how bad most people are at PvP. Being on the otherside, some rando naked chick stole my junk from my collectron and then came in my house to taunt me I guess. So I pulled out my shotgun and blew her head off. Easy peasy. I kinda wish PvP was more prevalent but it's just how the player base has evolved. Don't worry though, the mechanics are there for a reason. Don't let the whining dissuade you.
---
If you‚Äôre thinking of changing weapons relatively soon I‚Äôd focus more on the perks that will assist you in the long run, then when you have a weapon you like, you can choose perks around that! It was only when I hit level 50 that I really started thinking about my build and moving perks around and it didn‚Äôt effect game play for me as you‚Äôll mostly be questing/exploring/looting and then higher level events later on
---
Thanks for the DV, but scamming is scamming!
---
See you next Tuesday!
---
pick whos characters you like more. you can still grind rep for both afterward, and the ones you screw over will love you again after a couple of days
---
Some safes are marked inaccessible on a random basis
---
Just got to try your luck
---
Bloody Mess is the one everyone should take, because it works for all builds. 
---
Glow Sight... Like Exterminator, means micromanaging to me, so, no.
---
sorry emote
---
Got to the end of one today and went to out in the code and instead of bringing me to the keypad view it instantly said "invalid code" and I didnt even type a single number.  I was then locked out.  Talk about pissed...
---
I‚Äôve been waiting for this display case all year
---
Haha omg that is some serious, dimension altering C H O N K
---
i never downvote dude 
---
i find it passively wimpish
---
i just joked , clearly the lad caught a scammer and burned him , id do the same for wasting my time.
---
I found the oom questline to be too boring and more fetch quest centered than a lot of the game
---
i hate that you're right.
---
Weird. Didnt know that. Never seen the one in Monangah inaccessible with the perk equipped.
---
Is there a way to make forbidden knowledge pop up besides randomly?
---
I second that wendigo thing. The stories confirm it, and they are usually found as bosses with gouhls. Which is why I personally think wendigo, should count as ghouls.
---
Thanks for the heads up! That is an insta-buy for me. I have seen them in people's camps and didn't know what they were called or how to get it, I thought it may be an elusive plan I had missed.
---
One of the challenges was to claim three workshops.  Banged that out, and after the 3rd one was claimed, there was no indication of the challenge completing (audible or visual) and my SCORE value did not change at all.  
---
So no.  You cannot still do the challenges and get credit, at least based on that data point.
---
Imagine for a second, if you will, that you're a company that makes video games. You create an entire new battle pass like system, KNOWING FULL WELL that you have an auto-complete challenges bug and have basically... forever, and then based the ENTIRE system on challenges. It seems a little crazy, a teensy bit, but hey, bugs legit do happen and sometimes they are really, really, really painful to track down. It happens, I've lived through chasing shitty bugs for months, it's so dumb and upsetting and frustrating. I get it.
---
BUT, I've never been able to just NOT build a workaround to a crippling bug like this in my entire career. This shit is so simple. They built on top of a known broken system, and knew this bug existed, they had an _obligation_ to build a workaround for this bug. Customer service should be able to award SCORE based on this bug. "Yada yada money" -- Yeah, them's the breaks sometimes. If they're bleeding money because of this bug, then maybe they'll fix it. They damn well should have logging in place to know each instance of its occurrence by now, and should be able to _easily_ fix this. It'd probably be manual, painful and not a long term solution, but again, knowingly make bad decisions that'll impact your customer and sometimes you gotta deal with the fallout (hah!). 
---
I really, really want to be clear though. This isn't incompetence. This isn't malice. This is just not giving a shit and throwing in the towel sort of behavior. They can fix SCORE, it's possible, it's just a number in a database. They _choose_ not to help their customers.
---
The advantages to 3rd person are endless. The main thing I love is that I can dodge shots by running perpendicular to the shooter without losing sight of the shooter.
---
Damn so many things I want ..  so little atoms . Damn you legendary run. Do I buy atoms or grin hours for atoms ......  dammit Bethesda!
---
Never got one from a machine until my Luck was at least 6+, however the past two times the machine grabbed it for me it never dispensed it, think I‚Äôve only ever gotten about 13 total and I‚Äôve been playing since launch. üòÖ
---
You get the mission when you pick up "technical data" a somewhat rare drop in crates or containers.
---
Man this would be so funny in video form.
---
I‚Äôd say 25-50 scrip per extra level of score gained.
---
Apologies my bad..
---
Just the usual toxic behaviour that i‚Äôve come to expect from this place...
---
Agreed, I realized I‚Äôve had 12 Bulk Cork in my STASH forever and have never had much use for it. I think it‚Äôs used for weapon racks, not sure of anything else.
---
I believe it‚Äôs worth it because of how I play.
---
I spend a lot of time exploring and I will literally loot and scrap EVERYTHING. So it‚Äôs really nice to be able set up the tent nearby, scrap and deposit, and then keep looting! 
---
I love purchasing new camp upgrades so the atoms is a handy bonus.
---
The server, I don‚Äôt really use much? Only if there are challenges like claim a workshop etc and I don‚Äôt want the hassle of people attacking me lol. I tend to stay on public servers because I like to do events with other players
---
Not at all! This kind of shit is what stops me from actually engaging with other players outside of public events. If I can't get something through player vendors, or drops - oh well. It's not worth the risk to trade like that.
---
Once I collected all the best stuff, and there was nothing new to do, I just stopped playing.
---
If you grab your tin foil hat...
---
You could argue that beth intentionally decreased the chances of safes being accessible to push up their NW numbers
---
It's a kind of magic
---
I can‚Äôt get any data or this quest to pop anymore every since I drop the data off a month ago. It‚Äôs getting really old now
---
Yeah I was asking for an atom refund as well
---
No wonder they spent the time to make an "I'm Sorry" emote.  :(
---
I think it will be like the setters or raiders. U don‚Äôt actually join them as such...
---
Further compromises an already weak economy, as 5.56 was used as a currency prior to this. Impacts server stability like any other dupe method. Free, unlimited ammo creates its own balance issues. Just to name a few....
---
Mmmmm XP, farm them all!
---
Same here for a long time. I seen someone on reddit mention ‚Äúthanksgiving display cabinet‚Äù and looked it up.
---
I was right with you bro... That sucked big time! Same happend whilst I was doing it on PC.
---
That's really nice. I also like how your can sink the weapon displays into the wall now, so much cleaner.
---
i hope you mean the whole internet , heres no different , some cool people
---
some wet blankets
---
Definitely depends on your build. 
---
My essentials: Good with Salt , Action Boy/girl, Aquaboy/girl, Leadbelly, Travel Agent, ThruHiker
---
Also important to me (but only use when I need them): Good Bargain (when selling to vendors), Happy Camper (when building up a camp/workshop), ammosmith and super duper when crafting.
---
No, i meant the fo76 Reddit community. Most ppl are amazing and want to help but there is an entitled, bullying element that cant have a debate and agree to disagree...
---
I KNOW! I love the Order of Mysteries so much. After going through the quest line I totally retooled my first character to focus on melee to use the sword and wear the costume. I really want Wasteland Warfare to release some Order of Mysteries stuff.
---
What I meant was I think they were trying to fish out new dupes, knowing that no one was duping concrete and cork likely. They probably looked for the least amount that the player base had of the common scrap
---
You have the best single player game ever made in a wrapper. I‚Äôm jealous, I wish I could play RDR2 for the first time again.
---
I‚Äôm still looking for a good gun that will help me against like level 30‚Äôs easier because atm my gun does 68 damage and struggles against them type of creatures
---
I wouldnt be surprised. I dont use that perk often but I've never seen a safe I couldnt open with it equipped.
---
You're fine. Ppl who dislike pvp can avoid it pretty easily.
---
Like if we met and you didn't get the hint I wasn't interested I'd just block you for a session and move on with my day.
---
I've seen those cars IRL. You can't convince me that they wouldn't still be running in F76.
---
Thanks,  I'll try that.
---
What platform are you on? If you‚Äôre on PC, I  can always see if I can make you something that will work better for you
---
Good news: if you put in the card but not the code you *probably* didn't lose the card. At your next launch in that silo you shouldn't have to put in a new card.
---
If I recall correctly, schools tend to have a few globes laying around, as well as baseballs. Then random offices and shops, but those are just one-offs so maybe not worth the effort.
---
Bolton Greens has a couple of toys, a giddyup and a globe.
---
Xbox unfortunately but thanks for the offer
---
Leaving aside whether the weather control of Atlas may or may not be useful against robots (considering that across the many Fallout games many pre-war robots have endured countless passing of seasons, sometimes for centuries, and remain operational with next to no maintenance), I do suppose that the BoS would be able to take down an Enclave 6 robot patrol (though the BoS corpses at Watoga may point the other way), which may consist of 1-3 Assaultrons &amp; up to 5 Mr Gutsy units.
---
The relevant part is that engaging such group in combat, would likely lead to Modus determining that the group in question is a threat to the Enclave, or at the very least, their surface operations.
---
As a side note, given how the two events Enclave events that work in concert with the facilities in orbit rely on relays on the ground, I‚Äôm inclined to think that the implied logical order of events is that the robotic patrols seek targets and install the necessary relays used by the other two events. Therefore attacking the robot patrols in such scenario do would represent a problem for all Enclave surface operations, likely leading Modus to take action to prevent further interference.
---
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll still be given out in future seasons. 
---
But definitely wouldn‚Äôt mind having it permanently myself lol
---
Check your addictions and mutations - they all have reduction to perk points

Like in fortnite save the world: SCAMMER GET SCAMMED
---
Well damn, I will just hound them until I hear something I guess.
---
WELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL! Right after i posted that i got a warning that the server was about to shut down and i had to find a new world. I had JUST shoved loads of stuff in the ice box at the rusty pick to transfer to my other characters. So i took it all out and left. And then it took about 3 mins to get back into private. And then i filled the ice box and left. I loaded an alt up and.. it was a new private world. 
---
about 50k in ammo gone plus loads of aid and a lot of mostly scrap legendaries with a few that were worth something. FFS
---
If the vending machine is connected to any other object, like a poster on it, or letters, or something like that, it gets stored as a blueprint and next time you move, it's all there.
---
For example: labeling them (ammo, weapons,etc.) Is enough.
---
&gt;At the time of this writing, the player count for Fallout 76 is an estimated 22,000 to 34,388 players online for the PC version of the game, with console users for XBOX One and PS4 ranging at an estimated total of 400k users across all platforms, showing a decline from the 1.4 million copies sold at launch.
---
Based on what sources exactly? Oh hey, look at that. It looks like there are none!
---
Forget the fact that their "figures" are based sometime prior to mid Jan 2020, you know, more than half a year ago. A lot can change in 8 months.
---
Looks like Mr "pull the figures out of their arse" is in good company.

As stupid as it sounds, I don't mind helping her go through the story as she's experiencing it, but a lot of it felt lack luster and grindy, and I don't want to have to do that for her then do it for me on top of that. Running the story again just doesn't feel worth it with how the endings don't have any meaning to them.
---
Abandoned bogtown work shop has a hidden floor inside the office building, filled with junk for screws.
---
You already can...
---
Not all pipe weapons give cork. Revolver gives steel only. I also believe that scrapper doesn‚Äôt give you any extra cork. This is a good strat if you are willing to trade screws and gears for cork.
---
I have a whole idea that they could have used the Legendary Run as a tie in to a OoM. Bring back some of the games fun cheesy 40/50s feel it used to have (think 60's Batman). SCORE rewards could have reflected that cheesy side. and there could have been subtle tie ins into a resurrection of the Order. I mean really there could have been so much play on comics, Hubris Comic nerds,saving Appalachia, tie ins to Settlers / Raiders  and so on. There was so much OoM assets they could have used. Plus Claudia Christian and the fact she is the around the same age as Rivers and she is awesome.
---
I completely forgot about the scarecrow. You have to press a button to make it light up, but the effect is pretty cool.
---
Kill wendigos, loot offices.
---
Thanks, but I have neither addictions nor mutations. Could they even cause all stats to drop to 1?
---
Don't tell bethesda that for god's sake!
---
I can be very persistent. Especially over 1260 atoms.
---
Does stuff normally cycle around? I want the red shift power armor
---
Play around with all of your shotguns, even odd ones that you would think would suck.  You'll probably find that some of them are much better than others.. in vats.
---
If that‚Äôs your goal you can do it
---
Great ain‚Äôt it.... i think there is also something to do with the updates. So i just re-did my mutations and they work better than they did. And by that i mean specifically i took less damage. Same mutations and after the negs kicked in!
---
I raised a ticket with Bethesda ages ago about the same behaviour with perk cards. Bethesda confirmed this happens and the solution is to ‚Äúclear‚Äù your cards and it fixes it...
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't Blood Eagles drop these uncommonly?
---
I don‚Äôt think those challenges are needed when it comes to trophies/achievements progress? I haven‚Äôt finished those challenges either, but the only trophy I have left to get is LITerally.
---
You would need to get to Ally with the Settlers to get access to the Shotgun plans.
---
Did so, still says locked.
---
I will check on my desktop later, and like I said, I don‚Äôt doubt that it may be the case and someone simply messed up, but I also wouldn‚Äôt discard the possibility that unlocked version you claim to see might be the one that got replaced by the version in which it says locked (the change to the unlocked version might have happened automatically along the phase change, and they could have required to change it to reflect that the pause ended without completing the task).
---
Forgot to comment it works for fallout first or if you have a team you can join in the same world the servers usually take 5 mins to despawn the items so if you‚Äôre quick you can get your items back
---
YES. I often play these tapes while playing.
---
Run around outside, in a clown outfit, asking if anybody has seen a wendigo!
---
PC is obviously easier to hack, are you denying that?
---
It‚Äôs just a visual bug usually. Check your carry weight to check if it‚Äôs actually visual or not
---
5.56 and all ammo was duped en masse prior to this and was already depressed in value.  This isnt a dupe method and ihave a hard time believing it is computationally intensive to add x units of something every 5 minutes.  Id suggest that you not let it bother you that people are getting free ammo.
---
What we have come to expect from Bethesda release dates sadly...
---
Did the autocomplete happen to you exactly a year ago on this exact date?  If so, the game remembers all of them being completed even if you were logged out properly.  Has happened to me 14 times alone in the past 4 months based on dates I wrote down last year.
---
I just don‚Äôt want part of the new content, namely dungeons and off Appalachia locations, to be exclusive to the BoS quest line.
---
I don‚Äôt like the faction and don‚Äôt want to be forced to support them in order to be able to play that content.
---
Once you enter Appalachia, you can NEVER LEAVE.
---
No, that's cool. I'm obviously being way too kind. From now on I won't care when people are going down around me. I'll just deliver my shit to my box, and go steal theirs after they die. No honour amongst thieves, and all that. Call for help, I may just stand over you until your timer runs down. Sadistic - maybe, but at least I'll get shit I didn't have to work for.
---
How about just letting us accumulate score for the next season?  A Score Bank.
---
https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1091
---
It's not really card related, they are not the same character. No shotgun cards on this. I could try to remove the rifles card however
---
Ahh, that makes more sense. I mean, it doesn't work that way, but I can definitely see Bethesda having this motivation, while remaining totally oblivious to how dupes are discovered, achieved, and shared.
---
Did you guys not know this? I thought it was common knowledge.
---
Because we can't stand so much grind.
---
As long as it‚Äôs not mandatory to access part of the upcoming content, I don‚Äôt mind.
---
It hasn‚Äôt been postponed. The 2020 roadmap goes through the winter which ends in 2021, which means they probably plan for sometime later winter/ early next year.
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt be postponed. But as far as the devs have stated, they‚Äôre still on track for the BoS questline.
---
Thought fans were spring
---
I‚Äôm sitting on 70k and almost 2,000 gold.. I literally have NOTHING to do and I‚Äôm still grinding away. *shrug*
---
They also take screws without giving you screws... overall weird design choices by beth
---
Yeah it's such a cool concept that it's a shame that they're basically all killed off before Fallout 76 takes place.
---
It‚Äôs been a ‚Äúbanner‚Äù year. Next up, ‚ÄúWhat a corker!‚Äù
---
Not true. Just like any junk item, you can reset your item list and start the hunt all over again after a server hop. My junk run yielded about 40-50 golf balls per server hop, less when I did a public server rather than private of course.
---
Does the bulk/scrap thing work with the screw challenge?
---
No surprise at all. Wastelanders was delayed about 6 months, it was originally supposed to drop in Sept of last year, but they delayed until Nov, then further into 2020. Legendary players was an idea that was supposed to be implemented this time last year but got put on the back burner for a long time with nothing else mentioned until just a few months ago.
---
It looks like that it do its best in vats, yeah. The thing that really surprise me is how much is more accurate than a combat shotgun
---
I use a mod in Fallout 4 (xbox) for converting ammo; the ammo-O-matic by SKK50 and it works like this, deposit unwanted ammo and select required ammo to be dispensed... it's that simple. Why couldn't something as straightforward as this delightful little mod not be created by the actual development team for Fallout 76... or moreover allow players to scrap ammo at the tinkers workstation?
---
It's the top floor of the tall building west of the workshop bench.  Access it by going down through the elevator shaft.
---
I'd have to see this conversation myself before commenting on it.
---
You can get the bindings quicker than what happened in that whole scenario.
---
If you‚Äôre using class freak, it‚Äôs a little broken at the moment. If you‚Äôve died recently, upon respawning you‚Äôll need to unequip and re-equip class freak. This isn‚Äôt true every time but it‚Äôs been doing it to me on and off since patch 21.
---
Never connected it so i cannot
---
What?! Sacrilege!! How can you say such things about the original 2 games! For their day they were some of the best written games you could find. I remember becoming addicted to jet to survive a pretty bad fight, then I became a slaver to support my habit, eventually just using Jet to feel normal. What lows we can sink to. Totally side tracked from the story, but that's the awesomeness of it!
---
Proof yet again that Bethesda doesn't actually play 76.  If they did they'd know how much a pain collecting cork us
---
You do realise that just because you compare something with something worse, it doesn't suddenly make the first thing any better.
---
in all fairness, explosive should probably be your last choice in weapon effects if you're considering berserkers with 0 DR.
---
I'm not sure! I'll test it this evening.
---
Well look at every other person on this thread and I think we are in agreement your wrong.  So go use all the  screws that you dupped into oblivion and leave your shitty ideas to yourself
---
Ooops. Missed that. Thanks.
---
I have the red Arabian horse, all my favorite guns, and a stack of gold with nothing I want to spend it on.  
---
They put resources into GTA online and make lots of money.  Why is Red Dead online the redheaded stepchild of Rockstar games?
---
That would be really cool. I'm all for that, even though technically you do join them in the main story arc. But, more Brotherhood is always welcome by me.
---
Powerplant and mid city seem to have the best loot. Grafton Steel is actually pretty good too but it can be a bit of a maze.
---
Try this... remove all cards and quit the game completely. Log back in and then equip cards and re-test...
---
I love how Flamingo units is a standard camp budget unit of measurement
---
I just transfered 5 guns, 10k ammo and 3 armor sets via private world today.
---
Yeah, my carry weight is actually down to 155 and I'm overencumbered (including AP loss while walking). :/
---
I don't know what the emote looks like but if they did a decent job of it and didn't break other emotes in the process, good on Bethesda. Some genuinely positive feedback.
---
Enjoy your ban.
---
Shotguns are amazing, but the key thing, that I‚Äôve found on my shotgunner, is not use suppressors on shotguns. They literally cut your range in half.
---
LOL too late.
---
Are you a twelve year old whose mom is using the XBox as a free babysitter? Learn how to use Google instead of harassing that high level player over there for circuits and ballistic fiber after they were nice enough to make you some mini nukes for the fatman you used for a day and then got bored with.
---
If anyone needs me, I'll be over by the Nukashine again...
---
That's just 2 emotes - Sorry.... not!
---
I'll keep that in mind for the future, thanks. But currently I don't have it equipped anyways. :/ So strange.
---
I agree! I have always found the BOS a bunch of turds, the order of mysteries was one of the best quest lines in the whole game and also the secret veil has become more relevant than ever!
---
I‚Äôm thinking more like we are their personal ‚Äúdog toy‚Äù that are send to dangerous locations because of some ridiculous idea.
---
Shotguns are bugged in many different aspects. Bad bugs include rubber banding health. Good bugs include magic damage bug with certain secondary legend effects, as well as a good bug with "blocking damage" armor that effects all shotguns causing major damage.
---
Oh so I have to build it ok
---
From what they said, Fractured Steel wouldn't be released until 2021.
---
Gt: Big Keebes 
---
I'm level 72, hmu and we'll play
---
I haven't had time to play lately but i look forward to your updates and wanted to say thanks for the effort.
---
I'm sorry, that is too consumer friendly.
---
I mean I know it‚Äôll never make the money of GTAO but I still love it and will play it forever. It just sucks the 2 games I play both are nightmares with issues pretty consistently.
---
I hope we also have the option to destroy them.
---
100% this. Extra challenges is no excuse for poor customer service.
---
The idea was to reduce the number of free atoms we were getting, so suggesting we go back to that is kinda pointless.
---
Unless you plan on being a PA Melee character, the arm mods are useless.
---
The twenty-five foot tall Colossus one that spawned babies during a SBQ event sure was not too happy last evening. About 12 of us spent most of the event trying to take that SOB down with the SBQ laughing at our pathetic attempt.  That was damn scary when that Big MF would roar and level 400's went fleeing. Geez...
---
I've always thought that this would be a good perk to add for pistol revolver builds to give them a little more depth and end-game viability.
---
I added link for source
---
So trade screws and gears for cork? That seems like the wrong thing to do.
---
It appears to be a genetic anomaly created by Arktos Pharma.
---
Try buying bulk screws from traveling traders...
---
I hope you had the atoms for it, because paying for the remaining season levels with cash means literally *rewarding* Bethesda for turning the game into an unenjoyable grindfest.
---
I bet it is, but I‚Äôve been a fallout fan for 20 years, so it deserved first shot over rd. My wife got me Jedi fallen order for Christmas and that‚Äôs in cellophane still too
---
yep, people tend to forget that winter ends in March for some reason.
---
Still says locked to me, already tried refreshing the page and open a different window.
---
There are certain combat shotguns that do the same thing.  Keep testing.
---
Where I can find this information?
---
In that case all I can think is to unequip and re-equip your armor if it has and SPECIAL bonuses. That‚Äôs been going on too. I haven‚Äôt experienced it, but I‚Äôve heard (through something YouTube channels) that this happens. Alternatively, I‚Äôd try just unequipping all the perk cards and re-equipping them. It‚Äôs definitely an odd on. Past that, submit a ticket. Hope it works for ya!
---
In a way it was probably to incentivize their fallout 1st subscription. What better way to give people atoms than to make them pay for a subscription that they don't even deliver promises on?
---
Yeah I was just wondering if there was another way cuz I'm sitting on a bunch of them
---
How do you k ow when the reset is
---
How did they not implement a weapon case in this game yet is beyond me.  I know they like money, come on Bethesda.
---
It's been a while since I looked into it - From what I remember about Wild Appalachia DLC &amp; Project Paradise, I believe you could find some Sheepsquatch info on the terminals at Arktos Pharma
---
I want them to pay me to steal the bonesaw.  And then I want Ward to pay me to bring it back.
---
Everyone knows screws become cork after they are removed from a weapon
---
I‚Äôm jealous of you fine folks that have time to game. I hope I‚Äôm still into gaming in 30 years from now when I retire.
---
Lol, from the game? 1) they probably wont ban people for this and 2) Ive never done it.  Tried to use some at a workshop that I found but didn't know how to do that correctly.  Ive seen a couple camps with them, and picked locks on and looted each one I've seen, but havent built any.  I just don't see how it ruins my experience since it doesnt change how i play.
---
Id rather have atoms in place of scrap kits and photoframes thats for sure
---
I guess when I was younger I definitely thought winter was in November and December and then reset. Idk how I thought fall fit in there
---
why do You think that bethesda will fix something that they "fixed"?
---
This challenge sucks on so many levels it has to be a joke at that point
---
Sure during normal gameplay, but if you have the resources and want to contribute for the community rewards, it's much faster and easier than farming cork spawns
---
I started playing FO76 in  January.  My main is level 170, my first mule is level 70-something, my second mule is level 50-something, and my 4th and 5th characters are just low levels I created for doing the weekly "gain 3 levels" thing.  Since January, I had been playing almost daily.  I got burned out on the grind, and now I have not even logged into the game for about a week.  I figured I would take a break, to maybe get excited about playing again.  I have been seriously considering just canceling my FO 1st subscription and deleting the game from my Xbox.  The longer I am not playing, the more I realize how much I do NOT miss so much repetitive grinding.  At least I have all of the Xbox Achievements, so I don't have to worry about those.
---
Are they talking about that one specific feature being released next year, and when it is it will be part of BoS, or do they mean that feature will release as part of BoS, and that won't be until next year?
---
I thought it was just me. I switched back to the paper bag.
---
Called it the moment I saw their roadmap. They‚Äôve always been sporty about dates, and very few things have ever landed on time. They can blame COVID or whatever, but they‚Äôve never been able to stick to a calendar.
---
1. Don‚Äôt get married
---
2. Work for yourself/invest
---
Never miss a beat
---
I honestly don‚Äôt mean to most of the time.
---
He‚Äôs talking about Fractured Steel, which is supposed to release sometime in winter. OP forgot that winter goes into next year.
---
Can i atleast take a vacation. Doing two sets of legendary run is tiring and boring af. üòÇ
---
PSA: The Thanksgiving Displays are on sale right now.
---
I figured it out actually lol
---
Ok thank You, so basically it's a mutated goat created by arktos and escaped like deathclaws?
---
Takes more farming to make a pipe pistol than to find a golf ball. I farm 40-50 balls a server hop. Not only do I get cork for this cycle but I also get plastic for a later one too. My item reset at the end of the run also nets me cloth for another goal.
---
Sorry yes its only the pistol, more for anyone with obscene amounts of the other components.
---
I‚Äôm happily married with kids and way to much a lazy/cowardly individual to be a successful business owner. But if wishes were horses no man would walk right.
---
Roadmap says "Winter". Winter runs until mid-March.
---
Yeah I am an idiot I did it wrong LOL it works
---
What is the foundation one? I could use that too
---
honestly i am waiting to see if and how they use that. i mean being "part" of Taggerdy's brotherhood would be the logical in for the faction, like how we had to use rose to get in with the raiders. 
---
on the otherhand that's like nearly all of the main quest there so yeah.
---
Don't worry your little head so much. Daddy Bethesda will pull us over the line regardless. Hell, they smashed 90% off the concrete total. I don't expect any different with the cork run too.
---
Kick back and relax. You could contribute nothing and I'm all but certain that you'll still get the reward in the end.
---
Re-equipping did not help but thanks anyway. I'll try again tomorrow and if the bug is still there, I'll submit a ticket. Can't keep playing like this... :/
---
Also displays 6 items instead of 4
---
Yeah. Not a good strat if your plan is to farm the components for the pipe pistols.
---
I'm gonna get as close to 100 I can, spend atoms to get 100 then not play for a few weeks.
---
So did they apparently,  on the actual road map it says "this year" top right corner of the roadmap
---
While that is true I just can't see them doing that. I think bunkers are planned to help expand the limits of our current camps over replacing them. As far as I know, Bethesda has given no indication their plan is to remove surface camps.
---
I see your logic, I just don't think it's likely.
---
Did you mean to send this to Santa instead of the fo76 sub?
---
5mm is a cartridge.
---
Road map also says "this year" top right corner
---
I personally would have gone with more actual content to keep people playing but that's just me.
---
Yup, and they‚Äôll be lucky to land that given how Wastelanders went.
---
[How's this?](https://gamstat.com/games/Fallout_76/)
---
100,000 players have earned at least one trophy in the last month on Playstation alone. That number isn't even including veteran players who had already earned all trophies prior to a month ago.
---
But please, continue on with your numbers from not only the least popular platform, but from an individual launcher on said platform.
---
Also, 8k players? Where have I seen that number before?
---
Oh, yeah. The person who worked out the math said that exact number.
---
And you know it's going to be a decade before they drop RDR3.
---
I think I laughed way to hard at this. So true.
---
My favourite quest and also still wear the veilüòÇ
---
Did you refresh your page manually as well? The page will act like it‚Äôs refreshed but unless you do it yourself it still gives the outdated info
---
You have a lot of Atoms.
---
Without a doubt, it‚Äôll all become a nice little Atomic Shop bundle when this is all said and done.
---
A lunchbox for every 1000 score past the season would be good.  Otherwise I‚Äôm throwing in the towel til next season, which means more of a chance of not coming back at all, and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs true for others.
---
Lol. I know exactly how u feel, lol
---
I'm always curious what 'work shop is under attack' whenever I first boot up the game.
---
Same for me, i spend a lot of time playing and the scrap box is a god send, i also put the survival tent up by the crater and its not too far from vault 79 either.
---
You heard wrong
---
Yeah.
---
I did, and also tried copying the address into a new page: still says locked.
---
Clipboards are springs
---
No there isn‚Äôt. There is an item memory for your character. It‚Äôs around 300 items (don‚Äôt remember the exact number). All you have to do is pick up 300 items  after you pick up a piece of junk (golf ball). Then when you jump servers the ball will be there again. For me I do a junk run on my private server and end the run with around 300 burnt books (cloth). This resets the run. I then jump to a public server and play some events for 15 minutes for the private to reset. Jump back into private and do it all over again. You can do that all day long.
---
Edit: 180 items. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h9g6nv/reset_times_for_items/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Yes, the winter content begins this year. They already mentioned that the content will come in parts, like it has every other season. They‚Äôre not going to dump all their planned content over 3 months in the 10 days before the year ends lol
---
Its always 1700 BST
---
It is I feel. Endless scarp box is why my wife and I did it at first. But then each month you basically get your money back in the form of Atoms too (1650), so if you purchase things often then you are basically get the added features as a bonus. The Tent has proven more useful than we first thought too. Only thing is I can't figure out how people have different skins for it yet. Either past shop add-ons or plans somewhere. I don't know. So at first you kinda have this boring standard looking tent...But it does what it needs too. lol.   But yes in the end it is $100+ a year extra if you look at it that way too. It just really depends on what works for you. :)
---
It's certainly nice to know that RDO is much bigger mess... But I try to not have much schadenfreude from that. I want to like Fallout for what it is, not just because the alternatives are worse. 
---
Also, interesting parallel betwen 76 and RDO. Both are from a company who makes beloved and successfull singleplayer games. And both are online games that the company struggles to get right...
---
He resets on Monday now.
---
Safe from what exactly?
---
Probably the perk that allows someone to dodge bullets it shows the dmg numbers on your side but it doesn‚Äôt actually inflict the dmg
---
I play both and I'm having more fun with Rdo even if both games are working like shit
---
False ,when it came to Wastelanders that thing dropped all at once
---
Oh that was Eckhart.  MODUS killed him and his.  We're all from the Vault, recruited by MODUS, cleaning up Eckhart's mess, when the BoS failed like the bitches they are in the Glassed Cavern.  I know it was hard for you all, but we'll finish the job.
---
No it's definitely bugged now. Might be a ticket job. I'll try again after work then lodge one if it's still busted.
---
Because having people in my bedroom, unannounced, is just creepy.
---
Someone coming and stealing from an extractor, ammo producer, etc. If anyone cares about those things. I have seen it a lot.
---
Starting yesterday or next Monday? Because my friend said he got gold from him last Saturday (8-8-2020)
---
100th time, no.
---
STILL no R91 skin ffs
---
Thought it wasnt sopose to work while in power armor, I was in my stealth suit with semi autos so I was deff not set up to pvp at the time
---
Even a OoM doll, poster, statue would be nice!
---
I don't know if you have heard, but PSA: The Thanksgiving Displays are on sale right now.
---
see why cant people lead with this shit, I've never heard of this til now I'lll have to try it. I feel I've picked up 300 items since my golf balls and they still have not reset. Also if your correct then I wouldnt say its a waste of screws, to many as it is.
---
Bud, look at this current roadmap. They aren‚Äôt dropping everything at once. why would they? Their playerbase dropped by 1/4 within 2 months after wastelanders content finished.
---
Why are you so against being wrong about how seasons work?
---
It‚Äôll most likely be a content dump before everyone leaves for Christmas followed by regular updates to the game
---
Oh my god me too!!! I also like the Responders log or whatever it's called. Really sad. Some chick locked herself in a room while the airport got hit by scorched and everyone turned.
---
Nah I‚Äôm sure it works no matter what I could be wrong though
---
üëçüòä
---
Doing it IRL has to count for at least 50 million.
---
Alrighty thanks for the tip!. Time to make 200million pipe pistols. Gotta do my part!
---
Year ain't over, to be fair.
---
Apparently it's bugged and you can buy from him over and over if you just go out after buying and come right back in.
---
Edit: That is what I heard anyway.
---
You could just see one of the developers sigh internally when asked about faction support in the QuakeCon interview.
---
if you dont like how someone else sets up their camp then leave and go somewhere else.
---
Odd. I guess try again later from a different device or browser. I haven‚Äôt heard anyone else with that problem
---
it started with the patch last tuesday. He reset when the patch hit, so if you were lucky you could have bought from him twice last week. He resets on Monday now. So he reset yesterday.
---
Go out of the wayward or conversation? As in say buy the 300 gold them what? I have like 1 1/2 months more of gold grinding and I need all the gold I can get
---
Looks like... Yep we somehow unlocked the BoS banner... Huh... guess someone duped a whole shitload of concrete... Git r done!
---
But, mudbutt you said that's how they always done it which was a fall statement from you, Wastelanders dropped at all once
---
Ah. I see. Ok. Thanks.
---
I got this error a couple of weeks ago when I was doing the same thing. I lost some junk legendary items, so I wasn't too upset. Lesson learned. I had a second account I wasn't using that I got for free, and an older PC capable of running the game at reduced settings. I now have a character on the alt account pick up everything as a added safety measure before switching my main. It takes longer to do it this way, but it is safer. I realize most people cannot do it this way, so if you have a friend you can trust, that will work too.
---
your friend was able to buy on Saturday because he still hadn't gotten the gold from the patch reset.
---
Go to any train station and buy bulk from the vendor bot, then scrap it.
---
1 Bulk Screw = 10 and will complete the daily.
---
If this is true I'll be bankrupt by tonight.
---
In Pubg back in the day if you got above lvl100 in the battle pass you would get tickets that you could use to buy some cosmetics etc. I think atoms is too much but something like scrip would be great
---
I just hope we get the option to stand against them. But probably not. We will be forced to work for more fucking fascists.
---
Buy the gold, leave wayward, re enter and buy again. I haven't done it because of possible banning, but I believe thats how.
---
[I found this a couple days ago.](https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/dielectric-flux/screenshot/18640742) I tried to delete them, but could not. This was one xbox.
---
Is this a legacy blueprint from when you could blueprint the workshop cannons?
---
we know.
---
Yesterday. I bought from him Saturday and again yesterday.
---
I am....not opposed to this idea : O
---
Don‚Äôt forget that in addition to the item reset you have to change servers. Also junk is public and so if someone else looted it on that server it may not be available for you. This is a big benefit of private servers since you get a fresh server that is unlooted.
---
Because no one seems to know how to close the door behind them. Including the damn NPCs...
---
I'll check on my next level up I swear it said no power armor tho,
---
I said season. Not that‚Äôs how they‚Äôve always done it... 
---
So we agree you were wrong about your post then or are we just arguing semantics?
---
You go fight the scorchbeasts in that radioactive tunnel we will stay here striping these old printers for parts and whatever we strip will be your reward.
---
Robbing their purified water?  If it was unlocked, you're not robbing.  If it was locked, you become Wanted, anyone can kill you, it's by design.  Your friend who is much higher level is a weak person and the reason Bethesda continues to make 76 a Safe Space.  Fighting for workshops IS NOT GRIEFING as it CLEARLY INFORMS YOU by taking the workshop you AGREE TO PVP.  If the game allows you to do something, it is in fact BY DESIGN.
---
I know this is late to the game but it is the most recent post I have seen in my search.
---
What I discovered is that sometimes the request just doesn't show. It may be when someone pre-Steam friends a post steam player. Anyway, If both send a request it matches up the two and accepts.
---
Accept Friend Request üòä
---
Ah. Ok. Thanks
---
Yes on the heavy barrel...
---
It doesnt always stay in that spooky look all the time unfortunately needs activating if you are getting it for that awesome scary look
---
Highly doubt you will finish the job. You'd probably try to experiment on the Bravos and the Scorched plague. And as I said, I only went far enough to steal a set of X- 01. If I could, I'd blow up the Whitespring bunker and MODUS.
---
This cheat has been patched.
---
Then go to your own base and use your own benches. If I want to put locks on my doors to keep the entitled rif raf out of my base, then that is up to me. I built it to suit my needs and purposes. Not yours.
---
I fought this guy myself for the first time last night. Me and two others. Took a lot longer!
---
I tried the rocksy glitch but doesn‚Äôt work for me. May have been patched?
---
I really love OoM. The storyline is for me the best story in Fallout, ever. No other quest in all the games made me get up from the chair and go for a walk to clear my thoughts. 
---
OoM really deserves more attention. Our characters hold the rank of Grandmaster. We could restart the Order, recruit new girls and train them as a covert peacekeeping force for the Appalachia. Or we could let Sofia rebuild the Order and just help her here and there.
---
You can use the heavy barrel, it'll turn gold with white paint at the end, but you lose where it says "Biznes" on the barrel. 
---
The Raider skin can be applied to any power armor, I've just put it over my Excavator set.
---
I saw someone talking about it either yesterday or the day before, wouldn't surprise me if it was fixed that fast. Can't have people enjoying easy gold bullion.
---
keep the levels the same +25 points per still then do the rewards like this;
---
1. Scrapbox
---
2. Atoms
---
3. Lunchbox
---
4. caps
---
5. Perk pack
---
Repeat. This isn't crazy OP, it's low effort and easy to do but you get the lunchboxes and atoms for goodness.
---
Now that's just not true. Fallout has always been about rewarding player choice. When BOS arrives you'll get one of three greetings:
---
1. "No friends huh, well don't expect us to waste our time helping out some random wanderer. Now go fetch me some cork, loser."
---
2. "A raider huh. Usually we wouldn't bother with scum like you, but we need cork and lot of it. Get us some, raider loser."
---
3. "You're part of that collective on the hill, right? Well, hand over all your cork or something might happen to that pile of crap you call home. Loser."
---
Yeah some peeps like space.
---
Though it's my vendor business philosophy that if you're camps lit up on the map it's a safe haven of sorts and you're announcing that you're there. I believe in locking up your own bed and private section, but having a common area open.
---
If it's not lit up and you stumble across it then you can't expect anything.
---
reset? so january wasnt considered winter?
---
I mean if they update it at 8pm eastern people in day Asia would be just waking up? Lol
---
Don‚Äôt suppose you have the vault boy pa helmet do you? Does it go with the raider pa if you do?
---
If you‚Äôre using vats that‚Äôs what happens to me. I‚Äôve tested it can vats my buddy in the head all day long and it shows 110 but nothing. Switch to free aim and he‚Äôs done. Always assumed this is what people meant when they said vats was broken in pvp but never looked into it deeper than what was happening to me
---
I got atoms when I hit level 100
---
I‚Äôm literally telling you that‚Äôs what I see. 
---
[Look for yourself. ](https://i.imgur.com/bDpKBgU.jpg)
---
Agreed.  I‚Äôve not sold any armour for ages unless it‚Äôs uny
---
It‚Äôs been up 24 hours. Which part of that are you struggling with?
---
Also Sofia would need to be involved somehow.
---
Man, if that were an actual reliable stat, I would 100% go with it.
---
Although, from the same website:
---
"The numbers on [gamstat.com](https://gamstat.com) are not official, this website is not affiliated with Sony or Microsoft." - Not direct sources i.e. questionable reliability
---
Also from the [breakdown](https://gamstat.com/how/) of how the website derives its figures: 
---
"[Gamstat.com](https://Gamstat.com) estimates are based on a representative sample of \~8 mln accounts retrieved via PSN AP" - 8 is by no means a representative sample. However, that's just a minimum. No average or typical number is stated so who knows how many samples are used. If it leans closer to 8, it's pretty shit data.
---
By their own admission:
---
"I found some other website's estimates, and they are very different from yours.
---
So it's their word against mine. It is up to you to decide which numbers to trust."
---
Yup...
---
I think this quote on their site puts it best:
---
"Please read [how it works](https://gamstat.com/how/) and make sure you understand the meaning of data before you jump to conclusions."
---
Oof buddy, I just feel sad for you now.
---
How long is it available in the atomic shop?
---
The PA can apply to any of the PA's. However if you play in 3rd person the headlamp won't light up ahead of you, instead it will aim to the right and from the foot. At least it does for T-65.
---
considering the name of the update is "Fractured Steel", im guessing there will be infighting and we'll have to pick which group ends up in charge.
---
&gt;Hands down my favorite storyline in the game.
---
My favorite questline in ALL Fallout.
---
It shouldn't matter unless you have multiple copies of the same gun in your inventory. Just about everything has been duped at this point so it's not easy to spot a dupe amidst everything else. I think you are safe to trade even if it is a suspected dupe. With that being said, I've found a few God rolls myself naturally and in player vendors - - they can't ban you for playing the game and winning RNG.
---
I guess January- aug/September was just all spring and summer? Made sense at the time. Seemed like winter came a lot sooner back then
---
You trading and getting a weapon that might be duped, won‚Äôt get you banned.
---
Yeah, I find it's easiest to just FT to Crater for the pic there, run over to the fort (and grab the remains if Buried With Honor pops) fast travel to Sacrament, run up to snap a pic of the small camp, and then run down to the cemetery to finish up BWH.
---
I actually do, the helmet on the Excavator set is the Vault Boy one right now. It looks pretty sweet together.
---
If Bethesda are banning people for unknowingly trading and receiving an item that may be duped, I've never seen a confirmed report. 
---
As far as I am aware, your fear is unwarranted.
---
I dump ultracite plans.   Only have 30 slots for plans
---
How many items can go on this Display case?   
---
The glass ones I'm currently using only allow 4 items  
---
I've used up all 20/20 Display cases in my base (I'm making a museum of all the Items in the game \[trying to\])
---
So business as usual at Bethesda?
---
I‚Äôm talking about after the first day brah not sure what time they started it but again like I said people no life specific games someone easily could of have 20k concrete saved and donated it or even a duper had it. The 15 mil goal was easily obtainable.
---
Yes! I never thought of this before (and I'm still kind of new) but that would be a great idea!
---
I would totally donate more concrete, but the fact they force you to donate 250 all at once instead of whatever you've managed to find is absolutely ridiculous. 
---
We want donations to help build our shit. Oh, you only brought 50 concrete? Na, take it back. I'll wait until you've got more before I accept your donation. -\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_-
---
Ah awesome I‚Äôll get it then, cheers for the advice!
---
Cripple the legs and head is the best technique. If it is too close range rune away and shoot the legs. Once she can‚Äôt run at you take cover to avoid the beam and shoot the head.
---
Your American arnt you
---
It does seem like more people have been locking their doors recently.
---
The ‚Äúscorched earth‚Äù one won‚Äôt trigger for me and I complete the event at least five times a week. I‚Äôm assuming that the glitch that‚Äôs stopping the game from registering my SBQ kills for the challenge is the same glitch not giving me credit at the end of the event.
---
Call me crazy but I think once the next big content drop comes out they are going to be completely forgotten. That seems to be what the developers do. They introduce a new concept or item then just abandon it.
---
And the new role is by far the most expensive, since everyone had 7 or 8 months of nothing to do but grind, and it's really just hunting, which was already in the game, but with extra steps.
---
If they‚Äôve got the big windows you can just jump right in üòè
---
So the root mod that gets applied to the armor piece appears to be
---
[[005253FB] &lt;mod_Legendary_Weapon3_Melee_LessDamageBlock&gt; "Cavalier's](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/005253fb)
---
Which has a property that adds 15% to the actor value [[005253FC]&lt;LGND_LessDmgBlock&gt;](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/005253FC) 
---
        {
---
            "Value Type": "FormID,Float",
---
            "Function Type": "ADD",
---
            "Property": "ActorValues",
---
            "Value 1": "AVIF - [005253FC] &lt;LGND_LessDmgBlock&gt;",
---
            "Value 2": "15.000000",
---
            "Step": "00000000"
---
        }
---
So you have an actor value that stores the total value of all the things that affect "LGND_LessDmgBlock".
---
On the initial mod you also have a property that adds a common perk. [001E684C](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/001E684C) &lt;ench_LegendaryWeapon_AddCommonPerk&gt;
---
            "Value Type": "FormID,Int",
---
            "Property": "Enchantments",

            "Value 1": "ENCH - [001E684C] &lt;ench_LegendaryWeapon_AddCommonPerk&gt;",
---
            "Value 2": "1",
---
This then references a magic effect [[001E684B] &lt;Legendary_AddCommonWeaponPerk&gt;](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/001E684B) that then references a perk [[001E6849] &lt;LegendaryCommonWeaponPerk&gt;](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/001E6849).
---
This perk has a WHOLE bunch of conditions and things that it applies, as they shoehorned *all* of the legendary affects into this thing.

This portion will occur any time you take incoming weapon damage, as seen by the **"Entry Point": "Mod Incoming Weapon Damage"**
---
It specifies weapon damage as it will not apply to fall damage + environment damage.
---
On top of that it then has conditions requiring that something you are wearing has the keyword **"HasLegendary_ArmorWeapon_LessDamageBlock"** and your character is blocking.
---
Provided you fit those conditions the damage is then modified by **"Function": "Multiply 1 + Actor Value Mult"**
---
Which will take the damage and multiply it and add it to our actor value from before.
---
**Damage_taken = incoming_damage - (incoming_damage * LGND_LessDmgBlock)**
---
Really long answer so here's a TLDR
---
TLDR:
---
Yes, any incoming  "Weapon" damage you take is reduced. Weapon is there because this wont reduce damage from falls/environment.
---
Then go to a different campü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yes? Not sure what that has to do with anything? The developers are also American.
---
Yeah I get that. The main thing that scares me is when players are too generous like today some guy he was really nice gave me two god rolls for a bloodied ss sledgehammer. And I was like he's a nice guy but then my brain was like shit what if they are duped aha
---
Thank god
---
Blasts like Bobody's Bizzness
---
Do you use it before they explosive bait your camp?
---
True
---
I'd do everything in my power to make sure Johnny guitar is included
---
I feel there's a misconception about this duping banning thing.
---
Unless there's a clear indicator something is duped (Ie there are thousands of it where it's not plausible like a bobblehead) there's no offence buying a weapon from another player.
---
Unless Beth is the most ridiculous, unethical business in the world, there's still the burden of proof that must be met showing the buyer to have breached T's and C's. The simply act of buying an item doesn't meet this. 
---
It's a game, we are players, and as a survival of sorts we need to be able to trade for gear. 
---
OP I say go about your business in game. Unless Shady_Tom_69 also has *billions* of wierd shit on him when you trade, you're fine.
---
Just be patient. It's not a race. Decide on a central location for your camp, farm purified water to buildup your caps and work through the quests. Visit other camps and buy good stuff for the future and relax.
---
Yeah it's probably just a stupid fear, I just would hate to lose my account tbh I've had it since the beginning and Its like 1 of my fave games
---
Hearthstone PTSD intesifies...
---
This is not the right attitude for this this game and quite contrary to your original post. I only pick up junk if I think it has been abandoned, otherwise I squat on it and give it a minute or two. Unless of course it has hundreds of bulk, then THAT my friend is a lesson to be learned by that player.
---
It‚Äôs not going to magically get easy at level 50 if you weren‚Äôt working on your gear and perks. What weapons are you using?
---
Have you done mistress of mysteries and the 3 side quests from reading posters at train stations?
---
Try the Ash Heap. Do Daily Quests. Do Public Events. Claim and defend workshops. Join Teams. Do Scorched Earth if it pops up.
---
go to crowded events and focus on tagging as many enemies as possible without worry about killing them, use XP boosters(sleeping, canned meat stew, craft-able food),  kill low level super mutants as they give lots of XP, &amp; use the benefits of being on a public team
---
It worked for me a week or two ago. It only worked for me if I was the one to actually kill the raider and selected the second option.
---
Do events only for leveling. 
---
It sounds like you're stuck because you can't easily solo the best farming spots in the game: Whitesprings, West Tek, Harpers Ferry.
---
Best events: scorched earth, radiation rumble, one violent night, horde events, encryptid, heart of the swamp, line in the sand; basically, high level ones. Your goal is to tap enemies and mooch xp. Only go to events with high lv players already present. Shoot everything once.
---
Nah the guy was a bloodied melee build like me and he just gave me 2 bloodied god roll guns and I was like no one is this nice XD
---
The corks might already give him away, there are only so many of stuffs you can make from it, it's either civil(too soft) or wine cork, or maybe, both. I suspect after all the materials, the ATLAS Observatory might likely being the new greatest winery in the new Appalachia, which also had it's old-time‚Ñ¢ RobCo robots ready 24/7 to defense
---
Not doubting you see that, but I‚Äôm also just saying what I see.
---
However, apparently the ATX update also confirms the goal was achieved, so I will assume is just a bug/error on Bethesda site.
---
the ritual binding is a static spawn; that would have been a boner of a trade
---
&gt;"     One can be found in the secret ritual area under the Mothman Museum. It requires a level two Picklock skill or the bathroom key to access.
---
    One can be found in the basement of a house north of Wilson Brother's Auto Repair, lying against an altar.
---
    One can also be found in the Lucky Hole mine, found next to the ritual mask, in one of the two yellow bins.
---
    One is located inside a blue bin next to a wood stove in the cabin of Johnson's Acre. "
---
Oddly enough I received both those plans within a couple turn ins of each other...happened a week ago.  Two to five turn ins a day since, and the best I get are outfits.  At least we‚Äôve made progress!
---
Then they'll just pick the locks?
---
Grinding hard doesn't make it any less miserable. You're just sprinting to an end game that doesn't exist.
---
Maybe it's just me but I found the earlier levels to be considerably more fun than the later ones.
---
I think based on how the landscape is, the giant excavator in the Ash Heap might be the tallest point when you're on the top of the spire
---
That's deep.
---
It‚Äôs plop.  Don‚Äôt bother.
---
Free states, enclave, moth men cultists, new raiders, 3 old raiders, settlers, responders, order of mysteries...
---
Because u can‚Äôt grasp that day 1 or 2. 8am in America or midnight in Asia. It‚Äôs a 24 hour update. That means a whole day. EVERYWHERE. Was 15 achievable from the start. I‚Äôd have said yes but unlikely. But it wasn‚Äôt from the start. The target was 150 million. After the first 24 hours. That‚Äôs everywhere. Time zones don‚Äôt matter ok. We had done 4.2 of 150 million. In the next 24 hours. Again everywhere. But on a Monday. Not a Sunday when far more play. 200% more was donated. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense. At all. You‚Äôre making an argument that‚Äôs holds no water. Why, when the belief was we needed 145 million more to complete the event, would people pour all their recourses into a bottomless pit?  Makes zero sense. And according to their daily update. We failed. According to up coming weekends the beret and the flag will be available for free in the store

..... Scrip lol
---
It's hard coz I've done everything I want in the game and normally I'd leave them in the dirt. Now I'd scrip them atleast heheheh I won't endorse cheating, but scripping ensures the cycle of life where I get my weekly dicking from the Purveyor for no gain.
---
No worries. I find it easier to pick up golf balls than to sacrifice screws. 
---
I‚Äôm at 5k Cork anyways, so it‚Äôs not really an issue. But for the average player, I have a feeling Screws are more precious than Cork.
---
It doesn't stack in an additive fashion. Each piece rolls itself independently. 5 pieces is a statistical average of 96.875%.
---
Even with five pieces and mysterious savior on, I have had it fail to revive.
---
Mysterious Savior doesn't have the same cooldown as the armor.
---
I tried it, but it displayed as a singular cartridge. I didn't even know there was a mesh and texture for that in the game, I've only ever seen it spawn in large quantities with the small ammo box mesh.
---
My point is a locked door means nothing if you have a window next to something like a bed. Just interact with the bed through the window and poof, you're inside. Once inside, some people don't bother locking their collectors because they think having a locked door will keep most people out. Someone could pick the lock if they wanted to, but most people don't want to be wanted. Being wanted means you are open to pvp.
---
Pro tip if someone has over 120 plans they have copies of them in their store that‚Äôs the limit for unique plans. The more they have the more likely they will have only mounted ones. It‚Äôs far better to visit someone with under ten plans then more because then they are likely selling a plan they think is important and throwing away the stupid stuff.
---
I'm 4k hours deep and I've run out of stash and I have basically every weapon I could want. Sometimes I will find a decent weapon and hand it to a buddy or a newb that seems to be struggling. You can usually tell if a player is new if you trade with them and examine their inventory. Other times you find a good weapon, maxed on carry weight, aren't specced or don't want to use the weapon, so you offload it on another player since it won't fit in the stash/vendor. It's a much better feeling knowing the weapon will be used as opposed to stuffing it in a machine for scrip.
---
Now we need a "don't one shot kill the legendary" emote.
---
Until you actually cancel your 1st sub, they won't give a shit.
---
I wouldn't be at all surprised if they don't hotfix the issue and release the fix during the next patch a month or so away.
---
I know right
---
I know about all that, but people can just pick locks on the extractor if they want it.
---
All mods for that particular type of weapon can be used with the skins that are made for that weapon.
---
I still have Cmdr. Sofia dressed in the Garb of Mysteries at all times. Was surprised others haven‚Äôt.
---
Yeah. Im kinda really wierd when it comes to scrip where if I get a 3 star legendary I will always check the value. If its above 5k I put it up for sale. If not then is scrip it to buy another 3star
---
Yes, you have -9. He can‚Äôt do all of this.
---
Their camp, their rules. You're not entitled to access anything that they don't want you to, as frustrating as it might be for you.
---
It is a weird game.  I'm perked as a sneak  rifle build, yet my best gun with highest damage is a 2 star shotgun - it is a monster.  I tried other shotguns and they are crap.  It makes no sense.  But I don't question it - I just don't change anything in my perks now.  I'm afraid I'll fuck it up.
---
I've had no really issues with Super Duper, though I've used it when crafting ammo, food, Radshield and Stimpaks
---
What's wrong with vats? I genuinely never used it in any fallout game ever
---
Seriously?  Fuck yea!
---
I think some people will use it as a "oops did I do that?" kinda emote
---
Refer to comment above where I said most people don't want to be wanted.
---
2 responder crates at Morgan Town trainyard. One right at the top of the tall tower and the other in the signal box as you approach the station from the south
---
I been taking it slow just a level of xp a day unless friends are playing a lot. I‚Äôm at 92. I prob will keep gaining a level a day so i can get my script roles and rank up for legendary perks. It hasn‚Äôt been much of a grind for me because I‚Äôm pretty active

BoS are in 'Rona lock down, 14-day quarantine for every state they cross from California. Do the math.
---
Next items after steel, concrete and cork will be shitter paper and sanitiser. You won't find a surgical mask in a vendor now either.
---
Fucking 'Rona. When will this year end seriously.
---
Maybe let us choose a currency for every 1000 score choosing between atoms, gold bullion and legendary scrip. Thus way all players have an incentive to keep playing the game.
---
Watoga high-school is full of globes, desk fans and typewriters üëç
---
Cool.
---
If you‚Äôre seeing an outdated/past version of what I‚Äôm seeing on the website, that‚Äôs an issue on your system end, not Bethesda. 
---
It could be a cache issue, for example. Something is still showing you an old version of the information.
---
I've been able to get a refund a couple times, no real hassle, just message support and include info like date/time. Amount, bundle name and reason for refund
---
Yeah the guy wanted the sledgehammer and asked what I was looking for so I just said bloodied side arms. Which is why he gave me them I'm sure it was completely innocent on his part and I'm happy I got the weapons cos one of them is something I'm actually gonna use. I just hate how it makes me feel like shit
---
I think most of us have done this by mistake at least a few times. The solution would be to just make everyone in the area able to loot during events regardless of whether they got a shot in. Is that something they are doing with One Appalachia?
---
The final scene in this quest broke my dang heart :(
---
 if I have my locked ammo factory near a window or not Near a window, if they want it, they pick it.
---
If you use the jet pack on power armor you can reach the top top of the world. I had to pop a nuka quantum and eat a sweet roll to boost my agility, but I made it to the top. The Top top.
---
Wasn't planning on it. Melee was best when in early game but with various Bloodied guns of all types, ammo for them isn't hard. My bloodied explosive 10mm is enough for majority of the fodder of the game. Ammo for that is everywhere.
---
I run only one vendor and if it ain't bloodied or uny which is the demand, it's a scrip'er. And *decent* traits too, not Godrolls but I don't waste peoples FT costs as I'm out of the way.
---
Leave a bunch of meat piles in the high grass around them so they know there's something there but can't find it
---
I feel like we are going in circles because you're not understanding. It's all good though, have a good one.
---
You'll get over it. Mod that puppy up and go shoot some shit. I'd just chock it up as a win for the day and thank the fella.
---
Brah ironic to say that about Americans while having typos etc but you must be British because you‚Äôre a cunt, and the original goal was not obtainable but people STILL put items in even if they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll make it, they still want rewards and items and a goal they all aren‚Äôt Debbie downers like you, plus not everyone checks the grand total online or is a dick on reddit and play the game, hence my point about people who no life games, the vast majority of 76 players aren‚Äôt on reddit.
---
I assume there's no difference between the PA jet pack and the SS jet pack.
---
Instigating / bloody lever actions for potshots / one taps. Furious/50%limb/25lvc at the queen/iss/big mobs.
---
I find hunting rifles way too slow unless there is only 1-3 npc that arent sub sonic bloaty boys or bugs.
---
Used to use a handmade when ship hit the fan, but pretty much rely on the levers and a 10mm I/E/25lvc for trash mobs now.
---
On my support character I run an AA/33/25lvc gatling gun and while not a "rifle" per say, it really feels like a vats sniper weapon and I notice way less rubber banding or damage not being applied as compared to my levers especially the bloodied. If only my AP didnt burn through so fast...
---
Secessionist traitors must die.
---
10000 ammo? Nice gonna grab me some 308. Nope, all 38.
---
They did announce they were working on this before the patch came out... but you could still make the argument they knew ahead of time the patch was going to suck.
---
Your sentence is pretty good and better than many english-only redditors often produce. You could substitute 'These' instead of 'this', 'anything' instead of 'nothing', 'that' instead of 'as': "These are just my thoughts; Bethesda hasn't specified anything more that I'm aware of."
---
It can hold 6, but it's not great for particularly large items. I'd use it for your smaller things and keep the large ones in your existing cases.
---
Yes!
---
Not you.
---
Okay, friend. You're absolutely right, even if the numbers pulled directly from playstation API indicate otherwise.
---
I'm sorry for doubting you.
---
I did like I said he's a really nice guy
---
Top of the world is probably close to being the highest, I can't remember if any places stood out as looking much higher [when I was up there](https://imgur.com/a/aHfOut9), but it was a while ago now.
---
A bunch of people who have downvote with no counter argument.  lul
---
FYI that Arabian is a starter horse and is pretty shitty.
---
Add me jaydizzy82 I need this also
---
We never found out one way or another.
---
The worst part is when you call everyone over for the legendary and the first person to get there one-shots it and leaves. Then everyone thinks you were the one who did it when they get there.
---
get a tesla rifle too
---
Sleeping - 5% xp boost, Cranberry Relish (cranberries are easily farmable at Aaronholt Homestead) - 10% or 20% with herbivore mutation and 25% with strange in number perk and mutated teammate, lunchbox - 25% (up to 100% if whole team uses), brain fungus soup - 10%... that takes you to 50%+ depending on variables.  Each Charisma/Intelligence also gives I believe 2% xp boost so full public building team is 8%, there is also a charisma perk card (magnetic personality) that gives +2 charisma per teammate at rank 2 and also Inspiration perk that gives 15% xp at rank 3 if in group.  So another 35%+ there if in full building party.
---
That does really piss me off when that happens. But I‚Äôm gonna go to sleep. And no, I didn‚Äôt downvote because I agree with you.
---
RDR2 single player is 1000% a better experience than anything Fallout 76 has to offer
---
I understand completely. Somebody can glitch through a window if there's a bed or work bench nearby. Fine.
---
But if the owner has locked the ammo machine (likely they will if they tend lock doors), then the theif will just pick the lock on the ammo.
---
I know cos I do this all the time on my raider character, I'm the cunt.
---
Yeah, like how nearly all of my secondary emotes just vanished last week. I'm counting like 8 that just aren't there at all. Like the robot dancing, Mothman, salute, one of the team up emotes, and a few more I can't think of off the top of my head.
---
Passive aggressive apologies are the only ones I can make
---
Have a good one
---
Great lol... just need to avoid vats in pvp instances from now on
---
Would actually be fun if we picked factions and could have clans or settlements, so much potential wasted. 
---
Collecting mats for the bos but we never rebuild anything ourselves.
---
Only takes 15 min to create a new character and go to wayward to get level up. That‚Äôs about as much time as you spend in loading screens for NW in case you didn‚Äôt know
---
Lol holy shit that happens all the time.
---
Dude do yourself a favor and go play a game that was designed completely and actually has a story.
---
Came on to search for just such a reason not to buy this. Thanks for saving me 1200 atoms. A shame, it's one of the more interesting PA skins IMO
---
Its kinda weird, but it definitely conveys an "oops! sorry!" to me.
---
Overseers bathroom has a box of screws and a box of springs FYI. Her whole house gets tipped on the reg by me. It's underrated. Mix of everything.
---
1. Git gud nub
---
2. Use critical savvy instead of better criticals
---
3. Rank 1 of adrenaline changes worlds
---
4. Psychotats is fren
---
This is true, and it‚Äôs been a weird year for everyone, so a little grace can go a long way. I honestly don‚Äôt mind them taking time, but they really do need to talk to their marketing department about making these roadmaps more realistic.
---
Yeah, I was honestly disappointed as much as she talks about it, they didn't at least give her some reaction if you do that.
---
Lmao yep, good news is if you can free aim most can‚Äôt. I‚Äôd heard something about vats and railways still working but I‚Äôve not tried it.
---
See... I can't understand how this would even be possible considering how our building budget gets eaten up so quickly. I know how much turrets take up of our budget. But thousands of walls stacked? Is it another unlimited building budget exploit that I'm not aware of? For some reason their excuses ring hollow in my ears and mee think-eth they lie-th... I could be wrong but their reasoning isn't passing the sniff test.
---
You‚Äôre talking shit. And u can‚Äôt figure out a 24 hour cycle affects everyone yet think that‚Äôs the same as a typo lol. Face facts. You‚Äôre wrong. Your also American so your used to it.
---
I thought it was a ton of fun until I hit about level 30. Now it feels like I‚Äôm in a slump and can‚Äôt access any of the fun stuff. Maybe thats on me/my build, though
---
They could always add someone else who passes the tests same as the players. They did it for all the early questlines in the Forest (have a human NPC hang out at the quest area to infodump) so why not do the same with the Mistress of Mysteries?
---
Others answer seems like safe bets. The hard part is Bethesda employs artistic renderings to make the map feel larger and more distant for backdrops at a certain distance, which makes for a really great view but hard to trust if the forced perspective is actually aligning properly.
---
In the instance I am refering to, the ammo converter or extractor wouldn't be locked, the point I am trying to make is that most players don't want to be wanted, sp don't think one set of locked doors is good enough.
---
It‚Äôs worth a google though to make sure I‚Äôm not talking out my ass
---
Most likely its just another reputation grind with some exclusive currency yada yada.
---
Did they say Calender year? Because a lot of companies use financial year.
---
Better at free aim with my heavy character, and I didnt attempt my railway on him I'll give it a shot if he trys again dudes still on my server
---
I don't know more specifics than what I wrote because I wasn't actually involved in any of it. üòÖ And I agree that they're not passing the sniff test here.
---
That'd be fun: have a new recruit immediately recognize your rank. Double points for us who run male toons but completed the questline. Yes my dear, I _am_ the head mistress. Mastress?
---
Thanks I finally got one in Monangah and sprinted up to the mansion
---
Nah it totally makes since, I did damage while aiming down sights but when I was using vats is when the bug happenes
---
I mean, at quick glance your build does fine.  I think you‚Äôre just having issues with the high DR of the queen.  I think the only other thing you could do would be to get a piece of armor with the reduce damage by 15% when blocking and try to up your fire rate to have ‚Äúmagic weapon‚Äù which should increase your damage.
---
Your build doesn‚Äôt show mutations, I‚Äòm guessing you have adrenal reaction and other mutations like eagle eyes?  You should fill your Crit meter quick with your high luck so you should be able to fire off a bunch of crits pretty much every other fire in VATS
---
The only change I might make to the build is to move a couple of INT over to END so you can have Fireproof when against SBQ, and maybe a couple of extra points into CHA so you can run Lone Wanderer while solo and Strange in Numbers when in group (tenderizer is cool, but shouldn‚Äôt need it that much except in a few challenging fights) (edit - drop INT down by 3, removing batteries included, and put 1 point in END and 2 points in CHA)
---
Well, Steel Dawn needs to be released this fall  like the Road map says.  I don't think they can get away with another long content drought like we had with the Wastelanders delay.
---
Damn, how long is it there? I'm sitting on 5000 atoms and this is one of the very few things I've been watching for. After the derecho hit the Midwest yesterday I've been without power for 30 hours now and no ETA for a fix, could be multiple days. I'm already getting screwed out of the damn daily score challenges because of this
---
Nuke Atlas!
---
Definitely does happen, not sure if some safes/creates etc are always accessible and some go in rotation ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Really?  I don't recall them seizing any of my weapons or equipment in F1. In fact, I recall them selling cybernetic implants once I proved I would be a good ally.
---
You left out the part that needs to be fixed, can you edit your post?
---
The presents have been duped millions of times. I see them in so many vending machines.
---
Ok, well I'd still pick it. The chance of finding a couple hundred caps worth of ammo is worth the 10 cap bounty!
---
it's worth it for the atoms alone if you're like I am and like to collect the weird occasional item. i was going to get it for just one month, mainly to expedite trading between characters, plus atoms, but now i've had it three. i'm going to cancel this month, however, and probably just buy a second account. i already have 5 characters, one of which has become a mule out of necessity, so having a second account to use as a trader, mule, and extra CAMP real estate just seems to make more sense and will be more cost effective after less than two months. private worlds are occasionally useful for a few things but i probably use it less than an hour a week
---
Runs a bloodied build. Get killed easily. Surprised pikachu face.
---
Yes, gawd forbid people were having fun. Lol. 
---
Thanks for the nuke selection tips on Harpers.
---
Your friend is the asshole. Nothing wrong with engaging in PvP if someone tries to kill you for your bounty.
---
[Here's where I usually find him, at my camp.](https://imgur.com/a/SsalT5o)
---
Gatling Gun got me from 35 to 50. Game changed once I got it. Still use one at level 230.
---
Ah yes duh. Lol. The whole point of this thread was to AVOID the Queen. It‚Äôs just tiresome at this point.
---
I was just on top of the monorail for...unknown reasons and I can day it isnt the highest point, the way the landscape is its actually pretty low, i could barely see the top of the Mount Blair excavator, i would guess thats the highest point
---
I noticed this recently too!
---
The last time for me that FO76 was anywhere near unplayable was after Update 11, when they updated the Power Armor and made the PA glitch happen more often? I quit shortly after and didn't come back until Wastelanders, so if there were any bugs even more game-breaking than that (and the nigh-unplayable Vault 94) I never got to experience them.
---
No glass in the way
---
Idk what‚Äôs a bloodied build
---
Do you mean poop?
---
Delays are annoying, but with 2020 going the way it has, I can't rightfully expect anything to go as expected. 
---
Delayed major content is still major content, and I'm happy to see things continuously added to the game.
---
I really missed out on those display cases. They look lovely.
---
Knowing the BoS from Fallout 1 they should disregard all of us as tribals and will only let you join if you go on a "mission" (suicide run).
---
If u can‚Äôt take the hits don‚Äôt use a bloodied build
---
I want this so much, far and away my favourite questline of vanilla, and probably in my personal top list for modern fallout quest lines
---
;D that‚Äôs a hard competition
---
the different tent skins are monthly fallout 1st exclusive free items. there haven't been any available the last two months i think.
---
Free for now.
---
If all it takes to string you along is honeyed words then ive got a bridge to sell you
---
Nevermind, it now appears unlocked on my end too.
---
White Knight, mainly so I could put the special points in agility vs endurance.
---
Also the wheel barrow behind the police station has lots of handcuffs
---
Wow, this sounds so much like MY character!  I have all 3 Rifleman maxed out, Tank Killer and Concentrated Fire (I rely heavily on VATS). I mostly use two rifles: an Instigating Sniper Rifle and a Junkie's Explosive Lever Action (which I use a rank 2 demolition with). My backup/close range is a Junkie's Pump Action which one shots most things.
---
Most of us figured this out on Day 1, dude.
---
Every level increased by 25 score... apparently 1 level does go up 50.
---
I can play about an hour a day and am rank 80 for what that‚Äôs worth.
---
slither?
---
Im OK with general pvp if it's say lvl 25 v 25 but not 348 vs 12 (personal experience) or even worse my first nuke zone which was 4 lvl 150s vs me at 25 or so all exploiting the drill/chainsaw/ripper exploit (you can kill someone near instantly when they haven't activated pvp)
---
Intentional feature, just gotta get good.
---
At least you did not also have a 20+ foot tall Wendigo Colossus with her too. We had 12 or 13 ranging from 90 to 400 and we failed, running out of time in the event, because of that big mother. Scary when lvl 400's are fleeing because that thing ROARED with a blast of fear..
---
Like some said, events and dailies. I was lucky enough to use double XP weekends for a lot of it. But basically constantly moving the storyline and doing as many events and dailies as you can will eventually get you there. Also as people said, sleep and canned stew, good 10% boost.
---
Yeh you‚Äôre a cunt anyways was referring too if they started the event at 6am in gmt-5 when the event started for say gmt+10 they would have missed the burst, wasn‚Äôt referring to 24 hour time zones was referring to when the event would actually start for them they would of missed the initial say Sunday boost according to you, since it would be the night for them when it started, sure 24 still passed but they woulda missed the major boost according to you. I was mostly talking about when the event would of started for them unless 76 specifically started the event at the correct time for them which is possible with the enabled hot fixes but I doubt it.
---
This is an underrated post. Im not yet finished with the legendary run but i can see how once you hit 100, there really isnt much incentive to log in until the next season.
---
I've heard that running a Bloodied weapons/Unyielding Armor setup is a good combo.... Is there truth to that?
---
I haven't even tried to grind it out and will finish over the next day or two. Just playing the game normally and doing the dailies/weeklies when I have time to play. There are still a few weeks left even.
---
I think there are much bigger issues they need to address.
---
There is currently a shotgun bug that makes certain ones do a ton of damage there are vids about it
---
RDO was fun, but once you've done one bounty mission you've done them all, and I ran out of stuff to do pretty quick compared to GTAO.
---
Thank man, I appreciate your help :)
---
Why should others care about what you need? Use your own fucken camp and stop demanding shit of others.
---
And in my opinion it feels like most recent changes,  improvements,  cosmetics all feel like they've thrown in the towel and don't give a shit. Too many sloppy mistakes,  in my opinion,  means the team has lost focus and is just going through the motions.
---
Imagine her excitement!
---
There were a lot of posts early on about saving your Atoms to buy levels later, not sooner, and why.  I agree that the level cost progression (and ramifications) was barely touched upon in any of the official info.
---
Same.  I was offline for almost an entire day.  Didn't turn  it on until about 20 minutes after reset because I was staring at the wall so why not? 5000 gone.  Just like that.  Originally I only had 2! weekly challenges.  Critical hits and build up your camp.
---
It's been a longtime since I've seen a failed SBQ fight. Don't recall anyone leaving the fight either
---
Hahahaha I know exactly what you mean! Greetings!
---
Not sarcastically, I‚Äôm confused what you‚Äôre wanting them to fix?. Assaultrons are supposed the closest thing to a boss robots have along with sentries, stealth field is just another tool to make sure they don‚Äôt need high hp like sentries have. Same way bloodied commando builds usually have stealth perks to reduce the likeliness they‚Äôre attacked
---
Certain heavy guns including the .50 cal machine gun which has an included skin in the bundle....
---
did not work for me. thanks anyway!
---
I thought the Arabians were the fastest horses?
---
Where did I demand something u fucking dumbass
---
"filed under bug because its not fair."
---
just cuz you dont like it doesnt make it a bug, dude. this has been common knowledge since day one.
---
Same as above, done the daily/weekly as I can. At about lvl ~90 &amp; not too taxing
---
I have noticed a lot of strange game behavior after the patch. It feels like the game is literally unraveling
---
NO LEAVE WHILE YOU STILL HAVE A CHANCE. Delete this app and live out the rest of your life in happy bliss!!
---
It‚Äôs updated every 24 hours. How is this hard for u to understand. If it started at 6am your time. It update at 6am your time. And I‚Äôm the cunt?  Jesus Christ you‚Äôre thick
---
True. I would expect them to lower the score since it‚Äôs currently impossible. We‚Äôll see.
---
Sorry doesnt show as I bought it, should be 16 days if just came on today though
---
Two shot? Nearly lvl 500 and if I get hit am dead instantly! The joys of been a Bloodied build :)
---
The salute people accidentally had access to despite not purchasing it, so they removed that. 
---
As for mothman and robot, did you cancel 1st?
---
Just don‚Äôt buy 500 copies of the same weapon
---
not free stuff. Have mercy, mister
---
I saw a 10mm going for 6 caps
---
&gt;So the average person who has played ANY board game in life would assume it's the same cost per level/rank
---
So you never got houses in monopoly before?  Also why are you assuming things? Especially things found out on day 1 when people were jumping 6+ levels in a day.  
---
&gt;Sure enough, the next rank costs 50 points more!
---
Known since day 1, have you not been on reddit for 6 weeks at this point?
---
&gt;This system needs to be better detailed -snip-
---
Its pretty straightforward if you looked at the blue bar twice ever. 
---
&gt;This may be the first and last season I bother to competitively play through. Unless I know how your challenges scale up over time, it's false advertising to me
---
Your ignorance to how the system works =/= false advertising.  There were plenty of resources and posts about it.
---
Edit: define fair? Wtf is not fair?  It's all free, same time limit as everyone else, the score requirements are the same for everyone, all the given info was the same for everyone.  Fuck the auto complete people have an actual reason to be mad unlike this failure of a post.
---
Adamantium Skeleton, White Knight is a good perk to have only when you‚Äôre really repairing armor, other than that just keep an eye on your armors status. However level 3 Adamantium Skeleton is extremely useful as it completely eliminates limb damage you take. I ran it for a long time and loved it.
---
The thanksgiving display shelf is back, I've been waiting for that one!
---
Every single progression system mechanic currently in the game is like this dude.
---
Leveling up and faction reputation take more points to rank up the higher you get as well
---
This is also pretty common for any type of season pass type content like this 
---
I don't know why you're surprised, even more confused why you think it's so unfair lmao
---
No problem. Happy nuking.
---
Just tried it. I got to top of the round part of the structure but I can only get to the second antenna using nuka quantum, honey, and agly boosting food. How did you get to the top of the tower?
---
You‚Äôre referring to when the counter is updated I‚Äôm taking about when it first started, yes I understand how fucking time zones work I‚Äôm talking about when the event first dropped, if they actually updated it at 6am every time zone, or just the zone they reside in, and you‚Äôre the one that ignored the valid points and focused on HAHA AMERICA DUMB I SMART, instead of talking about how many players play this game and how 250-500 concrete per player could of done it.
---
But its for girls :/
---
It‚Äôs true what they say. America does everything bigger and better. And when u do stupid you really go all out. I mean our village idiot sits in a park shouting at the sky. You made yours President. üòÇüòÇ.
---
I had almost no one show up for the SBQ before its me a lvl 120 and two lvl 50s
---
It would be cool if they incorporate it into the reputation system. Like if we reach ally reputation with the brotherhood, a special dialogue option comes up asking if we want to join.
---
Great point. Didn't even think about that. I figured they want distant structures to be tempting to explore so they stick out more.
---
Have you backed out or restart fallout? Haven‚Äôt heard that one from anyone so it‚Äôs probably your account made a poor connection to Bethesda services.
---
I found it helps alot with the Legendary Run Grind actually. All the dailies give a nice boost to hitting that XP credit. Not to mention you don't have to throw away a ton of legendaries hitting the caps with just one character.
---
It started on the roll over of score. The same time as the updates. Fucking halfwit. I‚Äôm done. Can‚Äôt have a battle of wits with an unarmed man. Or child. Or whatever. Utter bellend
---
This one time I was calling for people to come and tag the legendary enemy and before the arrived I accidently shot it.
---
This one guy was like "thanks for saving it, to bad the one shotter got here fist".
---
I didnt know what to say. Just said your welcome and left it at that hahaha.
---
Again ignoring points and trying to delude the convo with not related shit brah not even making this political and you somehow do it Jesus.
---
Enjoy the grind! What‚Äôs your platform?
---
Or! Go to therapy!
---
100% no matter how many time Bethesda fucks up there is always gonna be white night ,thumps up bro you aware
---
I meant hitting the daily limits on 3 characters.  Caps, bullion, and scrip.  Wowza.
---
Yeah but for me joining the brotherhood through a bunch of terminals and the DMV always felt like a loophole we use to progress through the main mission. It would be nice if players get the option to officially become a brotherhood knight/paladin.
---
On sale now!
---
I can and I will. üòÜ  
---
I was in the days of the Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Gameboy, and every Playstation so far. I did play games similar to that but 3D is largely whre it's at for me.  
---
FF7 is a turned based game and yet the original exceeded expectations. RE2 was really good despite the awesome graphics and Oscar level acting. The Remake was really good as well though I do have some minor issues with it.  
---
What I post is my opinion. If you love them then GREAT!!!!!
---
ha
---
Yes, yes, and yes! All of it.
---
I stopped using WK after a Nerf awhile back.
---
Plus after so many queen fights repair kits are more common than cork for me, so armor durability is a non issue.
---
I do use Adamantium Skeleton on my Bloodied melee since limb damage and damage over time can be deadly.
---
No, fallout 1st does not affect camp space. You get 1650 atoms a month, borrowed private servers that allow 8 people, a survival tent, an bottomless scrapbox, 2 emotes, an unmarked discount on some things in the atom shop, and some costumes from 1st. That's it. All other benefits were reneged shortly after they allowed people to sign up for 1st.
---
Lol called it British, see you ignored that too and dur I‚Äôm smart you stupid that‚Äôs your points you STILL ignored the fact of how many players are on this game could easily do that and even try to make it political I‚Äôm out go be superior and lose control of the world and get pushed back into a tiny island.
---
Barely any health
---
You might find it unfair. But it‚Äôs been known since day one; the S.C.O.R.E required to rank up, increases by 25 each time and that it has been stressed multiple times that it‚Äôs better to buy ranks at the end to avoid the exact issue you‚Äôre having with 150 points not being worth 1000 or 3000 score or wherever someone might be until the very end.
---
settlers have them sometimes too.
---
"Mason! The numbers! What do they mean!?"
---
Incentive is if it‚Äôs fun play if it‚Äôs not don‚Äôt üòÄ
---
Neither I use FireProof
---
I mean, even with nonsense like that, it hasn't been that hard to Rank up on the Season.
---
I'm at 88, have never bought a Rank, got nearly every daily and weekly done, and anytime there was an annoying daily I didn't feel like doing (read: Kill a Player in NW), I just earned 30,000 exp in Adventure mode instead.
---
Neither, because once you're built for a bloody build you don't usually take much damage at all. I would put points into something stealth related instead.
---
In Fallout 4 (many years in the future compared to events of 76) not every Assultron had a stealth field generator only legendaries and the dominator etc, so going cannon based here why would they change it so that they all do in 76? It literally makes zero sense that 75 years after the bombs fell they all have stealth generators but 210 years after the bombs fell only dominator and legendaries do. And while I'm on this point why can I get a cryolator in this game when the overseer of vault 111 designed it? They need to fix the glaring over sights that they originally just said fuck it package this with a fallout label on it
---
Guns break fast. Use both.
---
Noice. May be my fave gun in the game. Only have a one star junkies but primed it and it slays. Have fun!
---
I already managed to find a use for it after I unloaded on (with Pacifist on) some guy in PA when he came around a corner while I was doing a "defend your workshop against super mutants" mission. I saw big lumbering creature, so then I started blastin'.
---
Serendipity and blocker.
---
Just give me a new gun thats not just a reskin for the handmade then I will be happy
---
I know it‚Äôs just a bug no it‚Äôs.... unsettling
---
Name checks out.
---
That's Awesome! if you haven't already, I'd recommend using the Transfer Settlement Blueprint mod to save it...or even share it?
---
Overdrive, Psychotats, Ballistic Bock....in that order EXACTLY...Small Guns Bobbles if you have them...I had that problem too, and vats headshots will do a bunch more damage....good luck
---
In INT, First Aid increases the HP restore per tick. This can help with survivability
---
At the least it‚Äôs very aesthetically appealing, especially compared to usual method of just setting the resolution way low on distant models. There‚Äôs a lot more depth to the background to me.
---
I‚Äôve got 85 or so improved repair kits. üòÅ
---
I‚Äôll probably keep both. But I‚Äôm certainly wanting to see how this does on some higher level things.
---
Did you try 5mm ammo?  In the wild it shows up as a mini ammo case if I remember correct.
---
It's worse in VATS. They botched this weapon bad
---
Going to have to say that if they would like less negativity sent their way, they could at the very least release a SINGLE patch without screwing something else up. Sure, it's only been 21 months of constant blunders. But I have to ask, do you have the same level of job protection as they do where you can fuck up for almost 2 years straight and not get canned? I've never had a job that would tolerate that. Not sure how many people have, really. So yes, I agree with you. Someone should be laid off, but at Bethesda.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
1st. Try it with a little more hp. Besides the stupid meta there are a lot of interesting an strong builds.
---
2nd. Its supposed to be a challange. One hitting everything would make it pretty boring wouldn't it?
---
I have and restarted my Xbox too. I was playing this morning when they updated the atom shop idk if that could have caused it.
---
Script would be nice
---
They took our concrete just to sell it back, bunch of jerks
---
A lot of people do that just so visitors don't leave their front door open, rather than to do with theft :)
---
White springs - house with Xmas stuff has a couple toy cars and a truck.
---
I believe i have that already lol.  Cant be sure sinve im at work but im pretty sure i do
---
You dont ally with anyone really. Just do both questlines until it says Ally with crater/foundation for rep and all questline rewards. Choose the one whose reward you want the fastest. I split the gold equally but its not all that important. You are however not getting it day one. Now you get to grind rep for about a month and a half for both factions. Raiders are a little quicker if you go to the ones by ohio river adventures and do the photo quest for the raiders until maxed.
---
They do not give a fucking fuck.  Not even one.  If they did this would have had a resolution now other then give us money for Atom.
---
Theres a big brain meme to be made here but like this event, I just dont care enough.
---
I only just discovered this a few days ago, assumed it was common knowledge and I was just dumb lol
---
Running lmgs you will probably need them! Have one as a backup if one breaks on you. The AA one is probably the best for general use.
---
Globes
---
All the golf balls at The Whitespring. 
---
Dismantling pipe guns while using the scrapper perk.
---
as rare as any other weapon
---
Those 2000 rounds you have will last mere seconds. Lmgs just burn ammo.
---
This one ^
---
I have it primed and it's a beast.
---
You sure love your corn soup.....
---
I kept getting ganked, lasso'd off my horse and horse stolen when I played about a year ago, that wasn't fun to me, did they give a passive mode or anything to help with the ganking?  That's pretty much the only reason I quit, otherwise looked like it would be fun and those event stories you do with other players was really fun too.
---
Whitesprings
---
Loot every golf ball off the courses, check the golf bags inside the club house, and hit up the putting greens close to the main entrance of the bunker and clear the greens of balls.
---
60-100 cork ish per run.
---
Other good items are globes and the Crystal alcohol decanter junk items.
---
I spammed one fifteen times last night = pie.
---
Now what..... Do I eat it? I don't understand the pie phenomenon...
---
Cue daily quest to "recover dangerous tech" and it's just stealing some poor grifter's laser rifle
---
I had this happen. Today it seems like it was worse than ever before.
---
Like the toilet one last week. Best description for Patch 21.
---
Yeah ... I‚Äôm constantly crafting and buying .308.
---
Maybe they crashed..
---
OMWTFYB
---
I wouldn't say that.
---
awesome! I knew saving that blunderbuss was a good idea!
---
I very much agree on that. I was also the only one in my group who could see it
---
I love when the low level thinks it‚Äôs a huge threat and lights it up while everyone waits to each get a tag.
---
Carnivore doubles the benefits of meat ( tasty squirrel stew w/o carnivore = 10% exp, w carnivore 20% exp)...BUT .... with stranger in numbers card, it becomes 25% exp. 
---
I also like cause u can eat raw meat without worries of diseases. BUT...u lose healing and benefits from veggies
---
FINALLY VAULT BOY POWER ARMOR!!
---
\- Don't trust your Doc, mutation are good
---
\- Did you try dog food? It's better then you thought
---
\- Being almost dead is normaly a bad thing, but not if you've a bloodied weapon
---
\- See the Mirelurk Queen? Yes? Good you're dead already
---
\- If a player give you a nukashine you should drink it immediately
---
\- 9/10 players don't have a problem with nukeing someones camp
---
\- Move your camp station to change the fast travel location
---
\- When you losing health such drowning drink water to get your health back
---
\- Don't do power armor and vats. Just don't do it
---
\- Don't kill legendary enemies on events. Let other people hit it too
---
\- There are rare outfits in the game. Some are so rare that there more valuable then god tier weapon
---
\- Explosive weapon are garbage. Don't bother. Legendary effects not included
---
\- One shooting legendarys don't make you strong in other eyes, there just thing you're an ass
---
\- Nobody buys ammo for 3 caps. 1 or 2 not more.
---
\- See that legendary? It's gone now. Don't waste time and loot the buddies directly
---
\- Stealth bloodied commander everywhere
---
\- At the whitespring pavilion is a water fountain which cure disease
---
\- You die as bloodied or life long enough to become a junkie
---
Nothing I love more than during nuke launch sequence seeing a legendary one come striding out, ready to be a total and utter bitch.
---
Word on the street is shoot the legs out....
---
But yeah it's not a bug or a fix, if you're bloodied they're gonna cut you down whether you like it or not. Even full HP they're a handful especially if they get a jump on you.
---
I see what you did there! üòâ
---
Well the one girl did kinda murder the rest of them soooo there is none of them left to rebuild
---
Wrong studio. The one working on 76 is in Austin, TX
---
I love this idea, I was really hoping for the same thing. I really enjoyed doing that quest ü•∞
---
Just remembered i have 1k cork, time to see what great goods we have in this bundle....
---
Is there any chance there will be an option to turn off annoying sounds, like vending machine music, Scavenger Collectron Voice, allies jibber jabber and most of all the funky Mothman and Protectron shuffle tunes. I tried playing with vocals turned off but then I miss npc talk, hollotapes etc. I am literally on my knees begging Please,Please,Please do something!!!
---
*supposedly* coming with Patch 22 in September, but come on we all know by now not to expect them to keep their release dates...right?
---
I'd go protest out front. Copy one of the protest signs from 76 and have at it lol. My dad needs a job is my favorite.
---
Nice to know we aren't the only Vault Tech Experiments!
---
There‚Äôs a defensive mode now - people can‚Äôt lasso or hog tie you anymore. They can kill you with explosives still but it‚Äôs only free aim for them and no auto aim with weapons. 
---
They also made the players on the map invisible to other players unless you‚Äôre very close so it‚Äôs much easier to get away from griefers now.
---
Unironically incredibly excited when I saw it.
---
Serious put him in game as a roaming NPC.
---
Imagine the the dude striding down the highways, strumming away...
---
‚ÄúUh... yeah, that‚Äôs a real shame, isn‚Äôt it...‚Äù
---
The technical reason was not the jested inquiry it was more so the fact that any developer who gives a crap doesn't slap garbage together and throw it out the door sight unseen. I'd be embarrassed if any of the stuff in this game had my name on it, clearly most of it never gets QA'ed beyond it compiled with only 10 errors, ship it!
---
I make that stuff all the time. Green thumb, Silva Homestead, and water from across the street. Brainless way to easy caps when I‚Äôm bored. 
---
It‚Äôs not the best way, it‚Äôs the Moose way.
---
Feel the power of the dark side...
---
Not in the listed calendar year. Winter would be November/ December of that calendar year
---
Yeah, the animation is good.
---
They added BOS twice...
---
Sometimes you just got to quit as she will not fall and die. The other day I fought her for 15min, used seven fusion cores x 2 due to perk and she just wouldnt drop. Killed her in the end but man that was gnarly.
---
I find that the online portion is the worst part of most games.
---
It's probably because of how massive the power armor hands are and how the fingers are able to articulate. Plus you might just have too much draw strength in PA that it could break the bow, but these are all just assumptions here.
---
Yep, it still only displays a single round. I'm going to try again later and see if maybe there's a way, but I think I'm just going to have to find an alternative. I'm trying to think of quest-related misc items that are possible to display, like the paper targets or the inert bombs; maybe there's something that either uses an ammo box mesh or something similar.
---
If only there had been some bulk cork right next to it...
---
Please br a bit more descriptive? There are many masks like that. Do you mean the gas mask?
---
Thanks man, sounds better than it used to be, I might try it out again sometime.
---
That‚Äôs just when you turn off pacifist, take out a Fatman, hurl a mini-nuke in their face, and run as fast as you can before they recover from the 35 damage that they took from the hit.
---
Yus. Time for the so sorry entourage. I also wanna know if they patched the camo ss underarmor glitch.
---
Only if it's setup better. The first incarnation had some major problems - like effectively murdering little boys.
---
&gt;**estimates** are based on a representative sample of **\~8 mln accounts**
---
They wouldn't need to estimate if they had access to the actual player count data.
---
I'm not surprised you missed this small but very crucial point. After all, attention to detail isn't exactly your strong suit.
---
Don't be shy that looks excellent on you
---
You can get from anywhere to anywhere else with the SS Jetpack, just use a springboard trap to launch yourself. There are two of those, use the bottom one. The only thing to keep in mind is you still take fall damage, and with that velocity you‚Äôll also take damage just from falling too far down all at once or going too far forward without boosting in between. But the fix is a complete and utter game changer. With two pieces of 50% fall damage reduced armor, you can literally fly anywhere with little effort. You take no damage mid air or from falling. Just have to time your boosts just right, have some mutations like bird bones and marsupial, and decent AP regen. I run a bloodied build so unyielding for every piece other than the two fall damage reduced ones, it works great. 
---
[Here‚Äôs a video showing a few long flights](https://youtu.be/nbYemhMfq3E)
---
It was an epic fail! The best part was them trying to Fast Travel over and over again.
---
It's my go-to for food &amp; drink. IIRC it replenishes 15% of each (or maybe 15%/10%) and easy to make (especially with Green Thumb and Super Duper enabled). When I have excess I usually sell some off (although I haven't in this screenshot).
---
Then don‚Äôt play nuclear winter it builds character and you‚Äôll have a better time unless you‚Äôre so mentally inhibited shooting other actual players and not npcs is out of the realm of reason for you
---
I think it would be weird if you donated one cork at a time, with more cork in a bag on the floor, to manipulate the ATLAS provisions box. Then again, it‚Äôs just me
---
It was the first thing I saved up for. Fasnacht gave me so many treasury notes. I have like 390
---
the chained and barbed tires are a single tire, not the stack of tires like in the picture wtf man
---
You might mean the secret service helmet? Or the flyboy helmet?
---
Betheada said beforehand that this would be the case. People had the exact amount per level up to level 100 figured out on day 1. I agree that maybe the atom cost should scale but all in all - this one is on you.
---
I‚Äôm sad that my main lost his veil...I had moved to an alt ages ago and they have since made it character locked..... should be so easy for them to make it so we could re craft and gain access to the basement
---
Let us know what system you‚Äôre on so we can  destroy your camp!  
---
Just kidding. Welcome to FO76. Enjoy your stay.
---
Hold the TV rabbit ears antenna outside the window with one hand, the other hand needs to be in a bowl of lukewarm water. Stand balanced on a single foot. Now, hold that position so I can ~~watch~~ play the game.
---
Yeah. Remove it because aimbot has no place in a game like this.
---
Yeah I really liked this storyline too. I actually think it ended too quickly. Feel like they could add more now that NPCs are back.
---
If you‚Äôre talking about those masks that looks like the one from the Division 1 &amp; Division 2, then Im on the same boat as you bro. I couldnt find any info on that either
---
The same thing happened to me. I did the quest 30-40 time without getting anything good; then 2 BOS Plans back to back.
---
Why do you need to be on a private team with a randomer who can grief you? Team mates can‚Äôt build at your camp on public teams, use them and it eliminates the problem
---
I thought the quest was excellent. I‚Äôll probably get downvoted because most people here love them but I found The Order itself to be meh. Their mission is basically just killing raiders / ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù and that‚Äôs basically just what we the player, and any ‚Äúgood‚Äù faction, kinda does anyway while doing other things lol. Their origins, uniform and secret base are cool though.
---
Its not the best choice. Its spacer's choice!
---
Considering I'd be in charge, obviously it'd be better!
---
Mole rats constantly one-bite kill my bloodied ass.  I‚Äôm filing thus under bug because it‚Äôs not fair.
---
Rockstars "LIIIIVEE SERVICEZ" are the worst thing to ever happen to them!
---
It‚Äôs not griefing, but I fail to see why you would want to be wanted all the time. Any lockpicking that is not yours will get you wanted when it is done at a persons camp or workshop they own. 
---
Also, not sure why you are stealing water as a lot of events give you that as a reward. 
---
As for your friend, they used to have a survival mode for PvP stuff long ago but got rid of it. Most players enjoy the game, wandering Appalachia and not fighting. 
---
However, as a non-PvP person, I usually block people I see with a bounty as it usually means they are not my type of player, unless they are less then level 10. So by continuing said actions, you could be missing out on meeting a lot of people, as I learned this trick from a friend I made on the game. I personally wish they would just get rid of NW and make a PvP, PvE and mixed game setting so that everyone would be happy and could play how they wish, but I doubt that will ever happen lol.
---
I'd totally get the Blood Eagle bundle if I didn't buy the Nuka bundle last week. Sadly it'll be long gone by the time my Fallout 1st atoms arrive, I really want that emote and the build is nice too!
---
Don‚Äôt be in private teams with strangers. Public team members cannot build on your camp.
---
You have to be logged out 30 minutes after reset. You can log off right before reset, then wait 31 minutes.
---
I use the cooking emote, just for the salt at the end. ;)
---
You mean the scout masks?
---
That bloodied limb damage minigun will be amazing for the queen, prime that sucker!
---
It's probably the one from the Wastelanders Raider Bundle, it's not in the Atomic Shop but your respective platforms store.
---
Wasn‚Äôt sure if my half-assed attempt to reference that game would be noticed!
---
You do no? You get the notes. And yes it takes a month or so to get it.
---
You have to be logged off 30 minutes after reset.
---
That would be a bit op..
---
Roll an alt. Delete, rinse and repeat.    :)

Any of these?
---
Really? That stinks. Both my wife and I have the PS4 trophy for completing Scorched Earth. Think we got it at the same time. Both of us also don‚Äôt have the progress for the in game challenge, however.
---
Almost as if it would be expected to require more and more xp per level.  Guess the hundreds of posts people made saying to wait until the end to spend atoms made sense after all.
---
First time I've heard of any type of RPG ever requiring more xp to level up the higher your level gets!  Seems preposterous but here we are LMFAO.
---
I know it wasn't me
---
You get treasury notes for gold bullion from events...
---
Scorched or some new tech thingie they want. Maybe some sort of civil war or my personal hope the Enclave in some form.
---
Events are the most fun I had leveling up. That or focus on the wastelanders questline 20+ should put you close to max. If you finish that go after the original story line to unlock nukes.
---
After that, if you want to min/max exp gain.
---
Base 15 int gives 45%. Full unyielding gear gives you 15 int gives you 45% Xtra exp. If you get unyielding/int that's 20 int total. Brain fungus soup is super cheap and easy to make and doesn't require a recipe. Gives 2 int, 4 with herbavore mutation. Leader/int bobble give another 5/6%. Brain bombs are harder but give you 3int, 6 with herbavore. Either of those stacks with cranberry relish (requires a recipe and semi harder) that gives 10%, 20% with herbavore. There is also a magazine that boost food buffs by 50%. A full building party gives 4 int. Moth man event gives 5%, sleeping gives 5%. Lunch boxes give 25-100% base exp. Berry mentats give 5 int.
---
Heard mentality mutation gives you 2 int. Egg head gives you 6 int. Strange in number perk makes both of those and herbavore 25% stronger. Inspiration perk gives 15%. Night person perk gives 3 int at night.
---
I may be forgetting something but if you go hard, you can get up to %400?
---
%800 if youre on a double XP weekend.
---
Cancelling 1st shouldn't remove them, however playing on a different psn account unequips all cosmetics including the emotes.
---
I personally don‚Äôt agree with that. There were lots of people who finished the run in the first few days. Just because they either played 24/7, cheated, or bought the board should not entitle them to atoms for being done. 
---
I play everyday, and am level 78 and will finish by the time the season is up and when that happens I can take a break or return to playing how I did before the season run came out. 
---
If you finish early, your done, that‚Äôs it, and that‚Äôs the way it should be.
---
Why would this be suddenly needed after a reinstall after quite literally over a year of being fine?
---
I've given the launcher complete permissions in my firewall to no effect, and I am unsure what ports need forwarding to please this picky as fuck launcher.
---
Which they still refuse to do anything about!
---
ü§ôüèΩ
---
Seriously, it seems like the perfect idea for a display case. I'm thinking [something like this](https://www.secureitgunstorage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/miodel52guncab.jpeg), with the door stuck permanently open. Maybe three or four spots for pistols on the inside of the door. Something like that would sell like hotcakes. Hell, they could add a pre-filled static version as a "floor decor" item and I'd still buy it.
---
I normally drop a nuke on them
---
Ooooh that looks really good!!
---
Gut feeling: with expeditions coming and the current atlas event, I think they are gonna be another "neutral" group and the enemy will be the wasteland/any enemy type in the area we are sent to scavenge from.  
---
I think it will go along the lines of "getting a new foothold" in the area and we need to go out and do supply runs to support "rebuilding" the east coast BoS
---
It could be the raider mask that you have to buy
---
Unless you‚Äôre a melee build I wouldn‚Äôt see the need for adamantium skeleton and you only need white knight when you‚Äôre repairing your armour, use fix it good as well and it‚Äôll repair to 200%, perks like serendipity are more useful
---
If only drinking all that alcohol during dailies gave us cork per bottle.
---
A mic question emote would be handy, I've lately moved to private parties due to the sheer amount of players refusing to talk at all, and whenever I see random mic icons, they're listening to music and still refusing to talk!
---
blue ridge caravan gas mask
---
‚ÄúThank you for your donation, soldier! Enjoy your reward - enough alcohol to convince yourself that Russell Dorsey isn‚Äôt actually the smartest con artist Appalachia has ever seen.‚Äù
---
I'm reading that Egg Head with Class Freak negates the STR and END loss completely. Is it true?
---
Spruce Knob (aka Foundation) has a sign saying that it's the highest point, but idk if it's true. Or did you just mean "farthest drop"?
---
You do have a good point though. You would think that we could eventually split off into raider, settler, BOS factions.
---
Yikes this thread, Bethesda has had  almost two years and the game barely resembled a finished product as of April nevermind the laundry list of dumb " oops we can't do anything right"  moments this game has had near constantly since launch. 
---
Red dead 2 was a single player masterpiece that more than earned your sixty dollars even before getting into what RDO offered. That being said it's shitty that rockstar is basically going to do what it did last generation by making next gen RDO the service it supports most but it is what it is. Not even getting into the RDO apocalypse right now (shocked and disappointed in RS) as they usually have the talent to back up any hubris unlike Beth. 
---
This thread is just blowing smoke to try and make  supporters of this game feel better, you shouldn't, ever, Bethesda is garbage and you should feel some guilt for enabling it for so long. At the very least that because they sure as shit are turning a profit of of you and that is the saddest thing of all.
---
That‚Äôs an okay idea. But i would only support  it if it was every 3300 score, like from level 99 to 100. A thousand score is way to easy to get.
---
I always said it would be neat if you had a CAMP item that played holotapes you own.  Like play one of the story tapes around a communal bonfire
---
Workshops are easy quick quests. Go to one capture it. Leave and capture another, return and complete defend or retake mission repeat. Super fast levels and resources. Players may occasionally kill you but it really doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
I'm not leaving, but I am also not wasting my ammo when some aholes don't let her land and staggers her in the air. I just do enough damage to get on the loot list and then I only fire when she's landed. If the event fails, it fails.
---
Until we get a usable chat, I think that's the only thing I/we can do.
---
No. Did it kill anything?
---
Seriously!
---
I sell what i want for the price i want. The clown suit should be reserved for fools who buy those items.
---
I plan to, just need to get the damn plan for it. It is kinda hilarious that the minigun only weighs .8 due to bear arms and its weight reduction roll.
---
Is it the [Raider pathfinder mask](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Raider_pathfinder_outfit)?
---
Log out 1 minutes before reset, then stay logged off for 30 minutes. Not 20 minutes, not 29 minutes, but 30 minutes. Then play the regular game before playing NW for the day.
---
People always downvote me but this works 100% of the time. I have NEVER had an autocomplete since I started doing this.
---
I havent done a single NW challenge and never will even if I dont get to the end of the fracking board...
---
Agreed. Not even going to bother
---
Wonder who will be inoculating them from the Scorched virus, or will they already have a cure for that, or did Bethesda even consider this as a sticking point with their developing story?
---
I had one, it was a sad weapon to use. I prefer AA, I, or TS for a Fatman. Although a junkie would be sweet these days.
---
The new Blood Eagle Bundle has an angry emote.
---
Sell it. I know for a fact that many players would love to display one of those in their camp
---
No. Legendary Chem perk should allow stacking chems more easily as of right now very few chems will actually stack without canceling one another out.
---
There's defensive mode which means players can't auto aim snap to you, can't lasso you at all and your dot on the map is transparent and really difficult to see. There's a setting for your horse that lets you pick who can right it (anyone, friends and clan only, no one) same with taking carcasses off it. You also can survive a headshot if someone lines one up on you and you can retaliate without consequence.
---
Honestly defensive mode is great and 99% of the time people don't fuck with you. You'll have the odd lol level kid trying to lasso you and failing without working it out lol. Somethings you can't do in defensive like long trader deliveries, see rival missions and any event/story mission you join disables it for the duration of that and usually dumps you back into free roam without it on so you'll need to switch it back on bit otherwise no restrictions unlike passive mode in GTA that doesn't even let you use a weapon. 
---
It's great for doing the moonshine and short trader deliveries especially for peace of mind, while bounty hunting it's the same deal.
---
Don‚Äôt forget you‚Äôll need violet flux for the ammo, I use a minigun for the queen, with ammosmith on its 300+ rounds per flux, so you can get a plentiful supply quite quickly, but if you are new this may be tricky
---
Themselves.
---
Yeah. Give bloodied builds even MORE damage. Super sweet idea.
---
You can't remember what you wrote. That means you are either too young to have working memory retention or too old and have alzheimers.
---
Yesterday an idiot using tesla gun spam n killed the legendary b4 it can mutate, end up he gets nothing. How i know? Cos i tagged the legendary too n managed to get a shot
---
I saw a dead one in the Grove when they were first added and I was just like ‚ÄúYup I‚Äôm playing Fallout 76 this has gotta be some horribly glitched ghoul‚Äù and I continued on my merry way. :/
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it does need fixing, but for the purpose of griefing there is an easy way around that as I have mentioned
---
The SB just laughed at me.
---
Even her minions.
---
It was just sad.
---
Yes the Pathfinder mask looks like a sweet little black respirator. Is a very good cosmetic as it is a gas mask and you can still equip into "hat" slot and "eyes" slot.
---
Thanks alot, I ended up purchasing the game on PS4,  does the "fallout 76 wastelanders" Include the game, cause I ordered it for $10
---
No but almost entirely it‚Äôs 75% so it‚Äôll be like -1
---
Will it still be available if we can't log on this week?
---
Yeah I have it so I can wear my bottle cap sunglasses and Enclave hat
---

The one I'm wearing here?
---
Nah she is not hard, I am lvl 101 at this point and flux isnt much of a problem. Even if I did lose over a dozen (10 of it being violet) last night due to the game crashing to desktop right when I was at my dropped loot after dying to an invisible mirelurk queen. So gonna spend all night re-farming that.
---
The next emo icon is fxxx U with a middle finger straight in the face. Good for showing it at event to one shot legendary kilers
---
I think you misspelled ‚Äúevery‚Äù since you couldn‚Äôt have possibly only meant bloodied. Iirc any build can use chems, that‚Äôs not something you only unlock when you are at 20% hp.
---
And the customer service is atrocious, always locking and ignoring any tickets that even mention score!
---
Nice, keep killing her and it‚Äôll drop eventually, or you might find it is a vending machine, damn that sucks üòî happy farming!
---
The janitor thing but after hours resolve community highly requested bug fixes and feature requests. However you get caught by one of the dev leads who decides to take you under their wing.
---
Then one day you attack a police officer and the lead makes a deal with the police to give you leniency in exchange for treatment from a therapist.
---
You and the therapist don't hit it off so well initially with persistence he breaks through to you and you break down into a fit of sobs when he tells you that it's not your fault.
---
You eventually head off to California to see about a girl but the community is happy for you and for the brief window of competent updates.
---
I have many different outfit "sets" but one of my favorites is this mask, 3D glasses, and the raider skinner hood.
---
Smiley was bugged for a few hours. You could just keep going back over and over.
---
For me the 3 or 4 last paints were super fast
---
Yeah from Ward
---
Could be that they were full but someone dropped.
---
Yah, I believe that wastelanders is in all their branding now after they released it
---
And this is why you never see anyone using mini nukes. They weigh too much and hit like a soggy pea.
---
nope
---
Why? I have to check what I got
---
No idea
---
6 items.
---
Yes just make sure u get the right perks to keep u alive
---
Awesome! Thanks for the quick feedback!
---
I don‚Äôt but that‚Äôs a badass idea
---
Just in case you didn‚Äôt know, there‚Äôs more than one system for seasons. Winter ends in March in the Astronomical seasonal calendar. However there‚Äôs also Meteorological seasons, which is based on calendar months. March is ‚Äúofficially‚Äù spring if I‚Äôm in the northern hemisphere. I grew up with this system in Australia so the idea that winter is in March is totally alien to me.
---
https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/aboutseasons.html
---
I‚Äôm guessing Bethesda used seasons to be as vague as possible though so ‚Äúsometime early-ish next year‚Äù is more accurate lol
---
We aint making 200 million, that's for sure :-)
---
Hm not sure. I haven‚Äôt seen anyone mention it. Hopefully it just fixes itself, but you may need to contact support to see
---
Does letting a legendary mutate give you better drops?
---
Strange.  I found digging a hole resets the challenges
---
Well being a lvl 457 on ps4 and just buying a pc kind of sucks
---
Question: do you auto unlock the plans to craft the rewards in a workbench or get them from the atom shop??
---
It was a great story, but I‚Äôd be more into it if it didn‚Äôt involve my male character in a veil and a dress.
---
Hey guys, I don‚Äôt mean to interrupt, but PSA: The Thanksgiving Displays are on sale right now.
---
No problem! Enjoy the game! Start playing now and you should be at a perfect spot to download the next major dlc when it releases
---
Urgh, is THAT how it works? (sorry to resurrect an old thread, but I was googling how to do this and this was the closest I've found to an answer)
---
So, if I unlock, for example, the free states survivalist jetpack, I go to modify my torso, and that will show as a misc mod alongside the regular, unskinned jetpack?
---
Brown and White one? Have to buy the Wastelandet Raider Bundle for it
---
How many is it today?  1 or 3?
---
Very good
---
The rocketsuit was already under the apparel section for that same price, though?
---
After the rep and gold grind, I was burnt out at level 50, or I should say I stopped having fun.
---
Will come back for meat week, and need a more meaningful grind, like legendary perks
---
I dunno if it‚Äôs a visual glitch, but restarting showed all 8, however they are all marked completed and I didn‚Äôt not get any score points so I‚Äôm missing out on 6000 points
---
Yup, one of the MANY things they broke with this half assed patch.
---
Wut
---
Did you buy the base plans or mods?
---
don't private teams. And if you have asshole funny friends don't private party with them.   
---
Fun police strike again
---
I have four on sale for 200 caps each. Nobody buys. I‚Äôll bring it down to 100 and see. I‚Äôve seen people try to sell them for 1000. Gtfo here.
---
At least you know what you are doing. Leveling up should be quick and easy.
---
I hit 80 today so I feel like I might as well finish it. 
---
The grind is getting a lil tiresome though.
---
Some but not all of mine showed complete as well.
---
Does anyone here RP? I'd love to play with an Order of Mysteries themed RP team.
---
They can‚Äôt make the current system work this sounds really cool but man do I think it would break right away
---
Whatever ones cost 350?
---
It‚Äôs used in lightweight/ultra lightweight weapon mods as well
---
Unless I'm mistaken, I've seen people wearing it.
---
Broken for me as well.
---
Your organization really needs to look into regression testing.  While not everything can be tested, the main quests are short enough they should be validated every single release.
---
I know this isn't something under your control, but it's frustrating from the outside to see a lack of testing.  I think your developers would ultimately accomplish a lot more if testing were preventing so many issues, particularly regression bugs, from going live.  It's a lot less expensive the earlier an issue is caught.  Ideally many issues that presently make it to live should be caught by automated testing at the time a developer tries to commit them.
---
Yea at least I got that going
---
Atom Shop. Tab over to where all the free stuff is from Quakecon. Should be at the bottom
---
The BoS are the baddies. Source? I'm an Enclave General.
---
I think this is the best idea yet for shared camps, I would love to have this in game!
---
Highest attitude in the entire map
---
I mean, if you‚Äôre THAT desperate for pie.....
---
Two is too hard to do?
---
I have a dense torso and fireproof 3 and I still die in 1.5 seconds to my explosive gatling plasma. 
---
It used to be 0.15 seconds so I mean now I at least get some leeway to not die.
---
I didn't even know about this flying method. I will test this so much now. For... Research. Lol
---
2
---
If I see a sky platform I'll shoot for three seconds to do enough damage to get loot and retire to a nice warm tent. The rest can waste all their ammo staggering her....
---
No. And that is the worst Arabian.  R* literally gave it to me as my starter horse in beta.
---
Yo nice roll. I have a few different legend combos in LMG but haven't tried an AA yet, Let us know how it is.
---
LMGs are probably one my favorite guns in the game. There is no windup, clip is decent size, fire rate is superb; only "downside" is low craft amount for ammo unless primed but still, and no "scope" attachments-- would be nice to put an acog sight on this bad boy or at least a red dot.
---
You definitely bought mods, the plans are 750
---
I will tell you after I do it. Don‚Äôt need everyone jumping to my special spot
---
ü§£
---
Really good addition :)
---
Lmao
---
Yikes
---
Explosive legacy lasers are an exception you are correct.
---
I don‚Äôt even know where to find locked boxes. 
---
Every box I‚Äôve come across has been unlocked. But I‚Äôm a bush wookie so I don‚Äôt actively look for boxes.
---
That is correct, it's basically crafting a whole new one, flux and all.
---
No shade to 76, But seriously - I don't think you're getting the gravity of the situation, Go play RDR2. It's /that/ good. Something you drop everything for. xD
---
The enclave bunker has so much potential
---
Bloodied heavy gunner here. I approve and once you have enough weapons that bear arms card never comes out lol. I have around 50 heavy guns in my inventory. All different types
---
Mutations, the gear you are using (power armor frame), food and chems all can affect your stats. Look at the effects and see if there is anything there explaining why you are having a penalty to str.
---
Rip me
---
We are.  We're the baddies. As far as I'm concerned Atlas is the bait.
---
I have a confession to make.
---
Everytime I go to Ward to do the daily he just goes "Go find my shit."  I talk to him again without even moving "Oh you found my shit"
---
Every.
---
Time.
---
No clue why.
---
*Welcome to the newest episode of the gameshow everyone loves...*. ***Guess The Mask!!***
---
Nooooo I'd never. (totally will)
---
they are the original "magic" weapon..
---
You need to learn the base limb/torso plans first, Regs sells those for 750/1250(?) bullion each IRRC.
---
Edit: spelling.
---
But is there a bug or something?
---
PC?  
---
I can craft &amp; mod for free fixer on 20 and 30 lvl
---
I use the metal barn by crazy cat lady's house North of Bolton greens. There is a locked tool box inside the metal barn.  I usually get a couple people spawn there with me but I usually beat them to the Box
---
Anything you can find bullets for.
---
You just answered your own question.
---
Ally.
---
You're no longer the "rabble"
---
Naa, I‚Äôm on Xbox, I‚Äôm clueless when it comes to mids as well and how to get them
---
You're mistaken
---
10mm ammo or a 10mm pistol?
---
I did monongah mine (one in long trailer) then ran to monongah town (one in long trailer on the south side of town)
---
Goto train yard and climb the one tower has a crate that has a lock or goto prison has a save that has a lock. When they had this challenge a while back. Took me a while to do it but man once I complete it I find so many locks. Just like the revive a team mate. Never did complete that challenge but next day I must‚Äôve revived 10 different team mates
---
Theres a difference between bring and annoying
---
I'm right there with you. This Legendary Run has been a chore and I just want to be done with it. Currently rank 83 and I have 2000 atoms ready to be spent once I hit 90.
---
Congrats Bethesda, you got me playing every day...however, now I no longer enjoy it.
---
Best weapons for leveling I‚Äôve found are usually non automatic silenced rifles. A good combat rifle is usually fairly easy to keep fed and if you can find someone to craft you a fixer you can go practically anywhere on the map thanks to the sneak bonus.
---
I also prefer to carry two other weapons for different situations. A sniper rifle, preferably a lever action rifle for long range and a heavy energy weapon like a Gatling laser or Gatling plasma. I use these on larger groups to get tags in fast and at Queen fights to get enough damage for the XP.
---
What platform are you on? I‚Äôm not online atm but other users may be able to jump in and help set you up with at least a rifle.
---
Generally speaking you will find that PC versions of games like this which use in-house engines targeted and optimized for consoles will have these sort of issues which are not prioritized. 
---
Especially with Bethesda as they have relied on the modding community to handle the PC version issues for nearly 2 decades.
---
I have been noticing the rubberbanding health recently. It's frustrating as hell. Does it only occur with certain shotguns or all?
---
Are we the baddies?
---
name checks out
---
How about simply starting with letting us have the ability to build EVERYTHING at other's camps.
---
I payed the fucking atoms, I have the fucking materials, so let me fucking build it.
---
Snakes slither,  a tiny piece or barely anything of something is a sliver.
---
English is stupid.
---
If this isn't a permanent emote made available to everybody at any given time, it's a pretty empty gesture honestly.  It'd be very stupid if it's free temporarily then removed, or eventually costs atoms.
---
oh yes
---
Which, given 'Thesdas coding skills they stay non hostile until they're at like 1% health and then die so you get that sweet sweet 2x bonus.
---
Gotta kill 10,000 robots with various types of weapons somehow....
---
I did the 1,100 with pistol by shooting liberators and farm hands with my Voice of Set.
---
Completed that and now it says kill 1,000 more with revolvers.....the Voice of Set, which is a revolver DOESN'T COUNT.
---
Fucking Todd.
---
Also, I'll point out, while I'm in rage mode here about Todd, the reward for "playing" this game for 7,600 HOURS should not be like 40 atoms or whatever.  It should be for like 5,000 atoms.
---
Anyone know the best way, on PC, to afk properly without getting booted?
---
I highly recommend a combat rifle!
---
Yes. THIS!
---
Bruh you got everyone dyin'...
---
You are going to be wanting a Fixer ideally for your stealth commando build but the prefix for this combat rifle kind of negates the whole build since you want to kill before being detected. The 25% fire rate is decent so I say keep it until you can get an upgrade.
---
I have plenty sell them for 350 a piece
---
Platform?
---
I'm still paying for and using Fallout First.
---
The challenges actually got me into NW. They aren't the worst. For things like kill three creatures and use stimpacks, I spawn in the middle of nowhere and look for crates until I get what I need. Then I kill creatures or run into the storm to use the stimpacks. It's the easiest way I've found to complete the challenges and avoid combat.
---
I don't know of any specifically good lockpick spots but I just would go for the cabin on the hill if you're talking about Morgantown. It has a terminal, usually isn't highly contested and it often has good loot.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôll be on later. In about 6 hours. If you can wait
---

---
I was actually excited to find out there was a clown suit. Somehow being a mutant cannibal clown hopping around with a death claw gauntlet is so satisfying.
---
For 250 score you're better off farming 30k exp for the repeatable
---
Unless they have bigger ones
---
xbox
---
I'm in the exact same account (Xbox) as I've always been on.
---
I literally bought Fo76 to escape the emptiness of RDO and the RDO update just made it unplayable with constant disconnects and crash
---
Does anyone else play 76 on that console though?
---
Alternate title... I came for the flux and I ain't leavin' 'til I get it!
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, I‚Äôm currently using a Anti Armour Suppressed Sniper Rifle as my long distance, it does 68 damage, is a level 10 gun and has 2 stars next to the level of the gun, it‚Äôs good against things up to about level 20 ish.
---
My close range weapon is a Sharp black diamond(sword), it does 50 damage, has 1 star and is level 15
---
Yea 6 out of 8 were marked competed for me
---
Get addicted to 4 more things and pick up a junkies weapon
---
Caesar/Edward Sallow described them the best way.
---
I got a 90% and love using it to tag mobs at events
---
You might also want to check out Ghost Recon Breakpoint. UbiParis shows complete and utter incompetence. R*, Bethesda, and Ubi used to be my favorite game companies, but now? Idk.
---
Gamertag?
---
no, you get one cork without scrapper. I've never used scrapper in my life and get it every time with pipe weapons
---
Omg finally! This is what I've been asking for since launch
---
I only use White Knight when repairing armor, waste of perks for combat. 
---
Adamantium Skeleton (AS) is good for certain play styles. If you don't do stealth as much, or prefer "run and gun", or tank playstyle then AS can be an extremely useful perk when used with other perks. You could put dense on your chest mod and pick up blocker you can tank a lot of damage already, but if you also use running perks, cavalier armor, serendipity/ricochet you can avoid a lot of damage while moving. Adam Skel helps keep you moving without breaking a leg, or your head which can really mess you up while you're in combat. Some don't think it's a big deal cause you can just pop a stimpack, however if you've ever been mauled by a bear you will know there is no escape once he snaps your legs.
---
instigating power attack damage melees are great in my opinion.  just keep rolling 2 stars for 50 scrip

Best food for the weight/trouble.   RIP my character's intestines.

Go to monogah or w.e there's usually addictol there.
---
Big lag/frame drop issues since the new update. Never failed a rad rumble until the other day. I was running ore collection and my guys were complaining about frame drop.... Wasn't bad in the tunnels....... When. You got up top though, single digits frames. It was unplayable. Have had this issue at other events as well.
---
Meeeee toooooo!
---
Messaged you
---
Isn‚Äôt this a good thing?
---
Screen shot?
---
Guessing you've only played Fallout 76.
---
They're selling it back to us!
---
Me thinks OP placed ammo factories at his camp and is blaming phantom griefers for his problems.
---
Typical BoS, demand your goods to in turn sell your goods
---
This exploit was fun?
---
What do you mean it wasn‚Äôt enabled? Do you mean captain cosmos?
---
Not for a bloodied build
---
nope cause I'm running a bloodied build. i depend on the stats to be able to move.
---
If you kill  the legendary b4 it has a chance to mutate to its legendary state. U will get normal drops. Period.
---
I used to 1 shot kill off the rest of legendaries at Uranium Fever b4 it gets a chance to mutate when players 1 shot n kill the first. This is to let them learn if u dun wanna share. Thats the only legendaries u get in events as long as I see U in any events on the same server.
---
I got a bunch of names in my growing list to watch out for whenever i m in a public server. And true enough, their habits dun change when they play in other public servers
---
Basic communication would fall under actually having some damn text chat, which games have had since the 90's.
---
Not if your bloodied build
---
This was my first since the Legendary Run began. I honestly don't know how I can prevent it
---
I can wear mine... just doesnt have space helmet on it, which is infuriating
---
Do you have the sun kissed perk or are you on a public team where someone is sharing that perk?
---
I‚Äôll be crafting the mole miner gauntlet though when I get enough teeth for the extra blade
---
bare fist damage increase and swing speed.
---
You get the outfit with it though too at least. I want it now but sometimes they throw it on sale at the last minute. Need to save up money or I guess I could give Bethesda 10 dollars...oh the ultimate dilemma, save or Todd?!
---
Just like Jesus intended when he invtented captilalism, God bless America
---
It‚Äôs not hard if you know where to go. My secret spot has 4-5 locks
---
If this happens when you're on a Public team, someone is likely sharing a perk that removes Rads over time. I believe that perk is called Rad Sponge.
---
Have you checked the perks your teammates are sharing?
---
I‚Äôm level 400 something and I still have a rough time with the assaultrons that go invisible...
---
Just did an event at one of those military bases in the bog and on top on the scorched beasts and scorched, there was an invisible assaultron fighting EVERYTHING and winning. 
---
(Usually the second they go visible I light em up in vats but this one never left its stealth field... That was an interesting fight.)
---
Keep playing PS4, unless you really need hacked weapons and legendary PA/outfits etc....
---
Log in match, unlock Box, logout. Log in match, unlock Box, log out. Super easy.
---
Man how cool would it be to at least have some dailies for these guys and getting rewards and plans for skins
---
i guess that was it. i just left the public team and it stopped. thanks for the tip.
---
Yes. Why would that matter if I'm on the account paying for First?
---
Seriously...  I LOVED this quest line. 
---
I would love a faction based off of them.
---
Other two effects are meh but that fire rate makes it better than a non legendary combat rifle so I say keep it till you find something better.
---
they're horrifying, my heart sinks anytime they show up in vats or notice me
---
SBQ is nearly immune to explosive damage.
---
The only challenge I did was the one to take a photo lol, I‚Äôm not going to bother with any challenge that can‚Äôt be finished in under a minute
---
My only problem with that is o cant do the fake sheepsquatch event cuz no one joins in
---
This would be pretty cool but you know the BoS are only coming back out of pure fan service. The next faction to return should have been the Responders. Have some ex-emergency service people restart the group and take over Flatwoods or maybe even take back the airport.  
---
I roleplay Brotherhood and don't think they should be coming back. Especially in this way.
---
just left the public team that i was in and someone was using a perk card that did this.
---
I checked effects and there are no strength penalties, I've actually never seen actual stat increase/decrease. I have marsupial giving me -4 int. but it's never effected me outside of speech checks
---
Ok but, that still doesn't answer what you are getting your girlfriend.
---
yeah that was it
---
I can't help but wonder how many people actually join a private team with strangers who grief them and how many are actually placing these in their own camp them self, realizing no one needs that much ammo and having regret over losing their budget.
---
As nice as it sounds it doesn't make sense. If you pay for some or all of your rank you effectively get a refund. It also unfairly rewards those with time/money and creates more fomo. If we had it we'd have people complaining. Even the biggest battle pass style game like fortnite has next to nothing beyond 100. 
---
You hit 100 enjoy the fruits of your labor and relax.
---
It does. That‚Äôs why I am writing a novel on the New Enclave in Appalachia.
---
Because if a different account logs into their Bethesda net account, it unequips all cosmetics you have tagged, so you will need to re-equip them every time after they play!
---

bDisableAllGore=0

That needs to go into your c:\users\YOURNAME\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76\Fallout76Customs.ini
---
It rounds down to 0 with Class Freak 3.
---
Tbh the workshops themselves are slow and pointless. You're better off just scavenging or buying whatever you need. Sucks that the made those the pvp spots because the people who are spec for pvp have no need for them so it's just huge levels attacking lower levels
---
I wish you wrote this in a more structured format instead of a run-on paragraph.
---
As for what happened to you... did he sound like a preteen or a teenager? Never trust either of those to honor a deal.
---
The bad guys will be anyone who doesn't bend over backwards, kiss BOS ass and give them everything they want.
---
Hey, I price things according to their rarity, not utility!  :)
---
No it's an MMO.
---
Workshops are a PvP environment.
---
If you want to have your own workshops you'll need Fallout 1st.
---
The real problem with trading is who goes first.  You trade with a random at the train station and then they take your item and log out.
---
Glad to hear that, always check the shared perks on public teams. I hate when people share rad sponge or sun kissed, I hope Bethesda implement a way to reject shared cards from teammates so I don‚Äôt have to leave a bonded team because one of them shared a perk that messed with my build
---
Oh ok I was wrong that‚Äôs amazing
---
That fight I just had with one now, the only way I was able to see it to shoot was because a melee scorched was chasing it and hitting it so I knew to shoot in front of him... Still had a rough time of actually hitting her, I was sweating bullets trying to shoot it as I hear the head laser charging up. Ha ha ha
---
If you‚Äôre losing 50 caps, you aren‚Äôt exactly low level yourself
---
I don't see anything wrong in stealing from a thief

Your poops would be all corny....

Tried again tonight and it worked!  Got bored pressing the button but nearly done now!

I don't have that file. Should I create it?
---
Dude my fav book growing up was a book called Morris the Moose. Good moose. Not mangy, but good moose. Moose. Ok I'm done. 
---
Moose.

If this is just a silly unequipping issue I'm gonna feel both grateful for your post and idiotic for mine. üòÇ
---
Guess what, you can complete the run without doing any of the NW challenges.
---
I'd like that, and junk walls. We did get junk fences, but a full junk wall set would be incredible.
---
Ahhh thank you. That would explain it. Just joined 1st about two months ago. Figures. LoL
---
So when do they usually add stuff for 1st members? Is it random or does it happen like on a Tuesday etc?
---
I just use the wooden icebox
---
I just run in circles around her and hit her when I can, take way less damage that way. when she shoots her laser I hit her
---
I hate the gunplay in rdr2, honestly. The camera shake is horrendous. And 76 definitely needs new rifle and pistol options for sure.
---
Shotguns are messed up presently. Either they do a ton of damage for whatever reason or they do very little damage and rubber band health; you will see a "chunk" go down, but bounce back up and instead do very little damage. The chunk seems to be the "reasonable" amount of damage the weapon is supposed to do per pellet hit, however the game seems to get confused with how many pellets are hitting at the same time while calculating enemy DR, status effects, legendary effects, perks, etc *PER PELLET*.
---
Shotguns have always been bugged in one way or another.
---
Both the nuclear winter cosmetics, and all unlocked emotes. Hopefully this is the case, but it's been my experience when swapping PSN accounts.
---
It‚Äôs both sad and laughable that the supposedly most devastating handheld weapon in the wasteland only tickles high level enemies
---
It's an 'expect to die' warning when you claim it.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I like the players that make cool houses but sometimes they just all look the same, I love making / finding like fallout style bases just adds to the immersion.
---
Even if you plan on going melee I recommend sticking to range until you get perks like blocker and serendipity online. You waste a lot of stims healing in melee combat at lower levels. Let me see who I have on and if they can hook you up with something.
---
Would that apply to herd mentality too
---
OP is just trolling us anyway, hasn't even responded to his own thread to thank people for their suggestions nor confirm one way or the other.... :-)
---
Or...
---
Deposit a bulk of corks every day in front of their office door.
---
Perhaps, to make them understand how irritating bugs are, depositing roaches in huge bulk is not a bad idea too
---
Pun intended really. Not for execution.
---
Try googling "Fallout 76 gas mask" then switch to Images
---
im level 63, doesn't stop some small peen high level dude with a mini gun shooting all my resource extractors and killing me before i even hear his gun shooting.
---
No, nothing new.
---
Ie Tiny pee pee kids trying to make themselves feel something other than dead inside.
---
There's been a bug for the last 3 patches where you can loose your anchor to your private world, even if a friend is still in it, you just can't enter it.
---
It makes all shotguns magic and high fire rate weapons.
---
Ammo
---
We were texting.
---
I used to have a shotgun for close range but I kept having ammo problems that‚Äôs why I went with a melee weapon
---
I'll check and reply afterwards. I'm feeling quite dumb right now, though. Not gonna lie.
---
i just don't get where all these people posting about meeting nice people. everyone i have met so far has been toxic
---
Not sure how to or where to link one. This isn't the first time I've noticed it not giving me the point either
---
Been that way for a long time.  I have a two shot explosive vats 3* level 1 hunting rifle sitting in my stash for whenever I get around to making a proper alt.
---
Yeah I was just power levelling a friend who got the game the other day and I went from capped 60 to 22 FPS and it was ridiculous
---
I‚Äôm still waiting on the outer world to go on a discount so I can play it
---
U need to set your expectation to &gt; 365 days
---
I'm not donating Cork. Call me selfish but it's too much of a hassle to grind and I've barely got any of my own, certainly not throwing it away and have to hunt some down when I actually need it!
---
I'm sure they'll lower the number but I honestly don't need Double Score. Would it be nice? Hell yeah, I'd get to take a break faster!
---
I'm donating Cloth and that's it.
---
Nope! They usually are around your level. If you dump scrip to an alt you can buy level 1, 3 star weapons and armor.
---
Sadly, some of the best stuff is level locked. For example, you'll never get a level 1 Tesla since the min is 40.
---
Bethesda "fixed" the tesla rifle lol
---
Ok. I guess I've just been extremely unlucky to never have gotten even a level 1 two star. I do leader of the pack and other low level events all the time to give the gear to new players.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it does as well. 
---
I‚Äôll have to double check though.
---
Nah 25 to 40 I always find to be the worst/hardest levels to grind, if you havent managed to pick up a decent legendary with good effects.
---
Lvl 25+ mobs start getting much more DR/ER than in the forest and most builds dont get much in the way of armor penetration perks til 30+.
---
Join a public building group, stash your junk and hit up workshops for the claim+retake events. I avoid the defend events because there is a much high chance of being ganked by another player.
---
Do public events, and do/find the daily quests for different zones, thats where a lot of my exp comes from now.
---
The 30s suck though, once you hit the mid 40s you start to feel stronger and by mid 50s you can be a demi god.
---
Int is a 2% exp increase per point so things like underarmor and buffs that increase int can help increase the exp you get.
---
And start thinking about mutations, once you have starched genes rank 2 its a real game changer.
---
If your on ps4 hmu, if not likely someone else can help ease that grind for ya.
---
Oh man, you haven't even gotten the infinite launch prep glitch yet
---
I'm sorry.
---
My tip would b. Uninstall the game n go to bed. Thats the ultimate strategy. :p
---
Yeah, don't even get me started on hitting the caverns. I feel bad, I just talked 2 friends into getting the game and they're stuck because the issue with ounce of prevention, so figured we would hit some power leveling..... Yeah, not good.
---
Maybe some raider war machine will show up and be the enemy of the brotherhood. 
---
(Ever since I found that rotting bird on the side of Seneca rocks impaled by some kinda metal spike, I always wondered if a group of raiders somewhere had a vertibird that shot giant spikes.)
---
I know...
---
Lucky if we make 10 million on cork, never ever will get 200 :-)
---
And don‚Äôt worry about that, it‚Äôs 12:30am my time so I‚Äôll be getting off soon
---
Did you start the Nukashine quests? The desk in the Morgantown tattoo parlor also spawns an Addictol.
---
And you know why they are not asking for screws...
---
the new stuff this month (valentine bed and woven round mat) was last week, so probably every month or so around then. it's always tuesdays at 10am EST (or whenever the new update comes out, sometimes it is a few hours later)
---
Yup, not even enough to kill a rad rat, explosive weapons are pitiful!
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure the AoE damage from the explosion resets the Furious trait after each shot
---
I‚Äôve literally had radroaches survive it. The damage effect is incredibly broken and not in a good way
---
lol I have one in my vendor for 6900 caps, I put it there as a joke so I don‚Äôt think someone will ever buy it
---
Finding a low level 3 star legendary enemy is a quite a rare thing. So you don't see lv1 3* items that often. I have a small collection of such items for alts i have collected over the course of last 2 years (since launch).
---
whitesprings mall also works
---
I can see buying low level 3 stars with a new character, but I'm level 245 and I do these events to help new players get legendary gear. This is the first time I've ever seen a three star level 1 weapon from an event.
---
Damn. I've definitely noticed that, and it seemed to take longer than usual to take down enemies considering I have decent shotgun. Guess I'll need to rethink my build for the time being... thanks for the info.
---
But get destroyed by bullets..mmmmk
---
Wife works at a winery, and Austin is 2 day shipping, lots of cork available to me.
---
Shame the kill Wendigo quest doesn't allow it to be any Wendigo, they patched it to only work on the Wendigo cave one...
---
Had this issue last night. Hit this person with every weapon I had including 6 nukes. Didn‚Äôt move their damage meter at all.
---
Strange. Hopefully someone else can help then. Best of luck.
---
I really wanted that banner from the concrete one that just ended but we didn‚Äôt make the amount, we got 4 million out of 125 million concrete
---
Careful dude. You can trigger it inadvertently. Without being on a team where they share it. Has something to do with Healing Factor and the health regen from Guided Meditation. I've tested it multiple times and always worked.
---
Awesome! I‚Äôll check it out. Thank you so much!
---
"It's time for me to steal all your components again, overseer."
---
"*... yes resident...*"
---
It felt almost as cool as finding a max level beauty.
---
Yes check now
---
We made 4 million concrete, we will not make anywhere near 10 million cork
---
I have one Junkie character and I must admit I love playing it. Full health, decent damage, I immediately consume all alcohol I find which keeps thirst full always, and I can easily find the chems in the world or very cheaply at player vendors. The Biv daily quests are a breeze, too.
---
I still haven't figured out all of the ins and outs of Reddit. I'd rather have the OoM flair than a platinum award. How would I go about getting it?
---
people that dont donate get the rewards regardless ?
---
Shame they never did anything with the presidential suite, still fun to sneak in and take photos.
---
You get 500 atoms on top of all the other stuff on rank 100.
---
Ha, I once was in someone's camp because I got baited for hell lots of stuff.. I open their vendor and everything is like 10 times overpriced xD Disease cure going for 1500 caps, purified water for 33, hell even ultracite jetpack for 15000 xD I know you set your own price but this is just ridiculous. I don't nuke them (it's a waste), I don't drop clown outfits, I just take everything from their camp that I can (food, water, resources if open) and leave.
---
Um... we got over 15m concrete. They didn‚Äôt update numbers over the weekend.
---
Hey see you're looking for ammo that looks decent on display, syringer ammo actually displays a small case that says ammo on it!
---
Edit: it looks like this https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Syringer_ammo_%28Fallout_76%29
---
Also im definitely stealing this awesome idea, i love the poster behind so you have the additional light inside the case.
---
I've had that happen before in that same spot.
---
If you have caps I would just lost to Xbox LFG saying you are looking for a non legendary fixer. I‚Äôve seen most players sell them if their vendors for 150 to 400 caps, but you may find one for free if you ask. Otherwise server hop at train stations to see if the bots have a good silenced weapon. Look up some of the lead farming spots that have barbells and weights and craft ammo as you use it.
---
Get a Fixer, it out performs all the bullion weapons!
---
How is it some of your items have punctuation in front of them?
---
Have you not been on the sub? How can you be disappointed?
---
Veil of Secrets can look surprisingly badass with several outfit/headgear combinations. I just wish there was a way to upgrade it to act like a gas mask - the terminals indicate they were working on getting it to be functional for protection against environmental hazards. Surely the combined efforts of Dr. Hornwright, Jen, and Commander Daguerre would be more than enough to fill the shoes of Frederick Rivers and improve on the equipment the Order had.
---
Np mate. Some shotguns are only effective in vats, and some are only effective outside of vats. You can do some research and see what you can do to make your shotgun op, but it shouldn't be necessary-- it should "just work". I only use shotgun for trash mobs and to cripple, I don't actually use shotgun for damage.
---
'Lady, we've been doing this for a while. Stay in the basement with the robot until I'm done.' lololol
---
Foundation thanks you.
---
They lowered it down to 15 million. The community achieved the goal. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
We done the concrete one. It just hasn't updated. At least I'm pretty sure.
---
corn soup is a pretty good food item, fodo and water, nifty minor buff. cheap and easy to make. 
---
I enjoy how theres more comments about the soup than the topic you intended lol.
---
Its not just duffle bags, its like almost anything possible.
---
People downvoting this man for speaking the truth. Have an upvote!
---
I‚Äôve been looking for one of these too, I know it‚Äôs pretty bad but I‚Äôd like to at least have fun with one. That or at least a Ts version.
---
That's how I always read it. That Natasha took out the raiders and Kerry, himself. Not that Fredrick was killed.
---
I recommend starched genes/class freak/strange in numbers and literally every non-melee mutation. You get so much.
---
Yea its the only gold daily I do anymore cuz I'm tired of fast traveling round the map.
---
It took ages for me to find a suitable box that didn't respawn as an fake box, and then I had to fight players over it!
---
Lol no where in there do I say u "have" to put something somewhere stupid
---
I read Give A Moose A Muffin to my daughter all the time. I think I still have that book somewhere in the basement.
---
I haven‚Äôt tried it with the ss jet pack, only my xo-1 power armor. Once you get to the top, above where rose is, it‚Äôs a lot more difficult to land on something above that....
---
Can we see?
---
Angry or No
---
Unless you regularly get the auto complete bug!
---
Having played on Xbox and now PC I can tell you there's less of 'those types" on PC, a lot less. :-)
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one rocking that combo - regular sunglasses also add to it nicely.
---
Yea i bet :) I have a lv1 BE25 pipe gun for my alts, with full set of lv1 unyielding wood armors.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
i do play on pc. :(
---
I‚Äôve started going between Vault tech uni, green county lodge and the fire department for the gyms, what‚Äôs Xbox LFG?
---
Today was an update or whatever it was, it force logged you out with a countdown of 5 minutes. It might not be the case, but I had it too. Once wasted a lot of resources, went through silo, launched nuke, started SBQ and people joined in, one by one they started to leave, i thought they left because it was dying slowly but in like 2 minutes I got the notification about new worlds available and that the shutdown is imminent in 5 mins. so maybe they also got this. also it's very common to crash or disconnect during SBQ fights.
---
I used quantum, cooked Scorchbeast lung to boost agility, and the most important ingredient? A sweet roll.
---
Wowser, dont go to xbox or PS4 then lol
---
I‚Äôve been thinking of doing a second run to get some missing trophies. 
---
The game is not as clean and refined as FO4 or Skyrim, but I still enjoyed my first playthrough.
---
I mean they are RADROACHES. Im calling it a lore friendly "feature " üòÇ
---
I'm also new, can you explain what you mean by "fixer?
---
No idea why you got a level 1. Glitch?
---
Either way the 1 stars are great to give to newbies or for alts. I got my alt a full 1star set of unyielding for the 15 int boost
---
Oh right sorry I had a brain fart
---
They're weapons or armor that I've renamed with dots, commas, or semi-colons in front. Forces them to the top of the list when sorted normally, so I don't accidentally try to scrap them. Habit of mine since FO:NV or whenever we first got the ability to rename things.
---
Its a sheep with "human like" qualities... its Apalachia, do the math. Not a big suprise. One lonely night in West Virginia.
---
I kept 1 in my stash, but never used it as it was nerfed big time. Just for display purposes
---
The sound effects.
---
That's the only reason we want a Fatman.
---
No.  That‚Äôs scheduled now for patch 34
---
Yeah I‚Äôve heard that it‚Äôs pretty good, but not great. I refuse to pay full price for it because it‚Äôs short and it‚Äôs not worth the 60$ price tag in my opinion, so I‚Äôm still waiting for it to go for 20$ or less
---
you can still max rep from both factions regardless of who you side with..
---
the important thing for most people is doing the settlers at least until you get the CSA so you dont have to buy it if they plan to side with the raiders...
---
I think many people do the missions for both up until "Siding With" which locks you in when you start it.. and then they decide
---
No, over 15 million concrete :-)
---
Thanks!!
---
Hell no, I do not want another 1 quest per-day reputation grind. I would immediately lose interest.
---
Thanks for the welcome everyone! I play on Xbox. 
---
I guess if I came home and my camp was destroyed... at least I get to start over! lol
---
Damnit. Oh well thanks anyway.
---
Workshops are the only PvP zones left in the game. The game literally warns you about it when claiming one. If you don‚Äôt want to engage in PvP make sure you are sneaking whenever inside the build area to not show yourself on the map. Invest in a chameleon armor piece to stop other players from using VATS. Otherwise the only way to avoid the PvP is stay out of workshops. Come back when you are ready for a fight.
---
Shhhh don‚Äôt talk about that ü§´
---
It‚Äôs an endless cycle for Bethesda. Fix bugs, make new update, get more bugs, fix them and repeat
---
Cool! Thank you.
---
Hope they introduce Crip Hawks, then we‚Äôll be having mad turf wars!
---
Woah woah woah, woah.... woah... hold on there. The PC community is wholesome as hell compared to the console communities. I've never had anyone scream obscenities at me on mic on PC... can't say the same about xbox.
---
Not to say there aren't assholes, but the assholes are the people using hacks in nuclear winter and the people using exploits that crash the server on purpose, and the people who follow you around harassing and hitting you and trying to initiate pvp after you've told them you're not going to (pvp is fine, but if someone doesn't want to just leave them be).
---
What you're doing is a legitimate game mechanic, as long as you're not using exploits to win your fights and it's just because you have better pvp skills than they do it's fine.
---
Suggest your friend grow a thicker skin, he's playing a post apocalyptic survival game, not a gardening sim.
---
Well it is a PvP zone
---
pvp is fine, i almost hope it happens but all my weapons are shit compared to some ahole with an op weapon that melts me.
---
No it doesnt.
---
It effects you in no way.
---
There is no "ammo economy"
---
"You think" it causes lag but agin... no it doesnt.
---
I have 6 friends all with 30 machines at camp and the lag is no worse then it's ever been.
---
You wanna cry about something  cry about how they unbanned the dupers.
---
Cry about how simple game mechanics fail to work properly.
---
Cry about how after 2 years they still cant even come close to fixing this game.
---
Idiots acting like this is some Salem witch hunt and you have to invent reasons to be upset about something that in no way effects you.
---
What is the reward for all this cork?
---
When you side with a group you will get a small loss of gold if you decide to take it all but it‚Äôs more worth it to take it all.
---
when it comes to photo opportunity you tell the robot the opposite faction you want to get rep for. That can be done once a day like the other daily‚Äôs.
---
I‚Äôm not usually one to weigh in on this, but workshops are specifically designed as PvP and are one of the last true bastions of it for Adventure mode players. You‚Äôre given ample warnings, it‚Äôs fully intended to be high risk.
---
It's absolutely not an mmo, even by the games own description.
---
And scorched
---
They lowered it to 15 million, and I just looked at the website after getting home. We passed, you've got the banner!
---
Can you drop plans paid with gold bullion?
---
So if I want rep for settlers I tell him that I will take photos for crater then I turn the crater photos to the foundation?
---
I noticed that too yesterday.  I completed 3 of the score but the alerts did not show up and the advancement to the score challenge, until after I removed the PA.  Although...I think the challenge showed up as completed in the daily challenge window, but the score page progress remained unchanged while I was in the PA.
---
Spawn in under the "M" in Morgantown.  You'll be right next to the bank.  There's multiple safes inside the bank vault area that have a chance to be unlockable.  Exit the bank and turn left and follow the wall until you see a hole in it.  Go inside this hole in the wall and up to the 2nd floor, there is another safe on the floor.  If you don't find 2 safes to unlock there, just log out and try again in the same spot. 
---
This challenge is not hard as long as you know where to look for safes.
---
Haven't tested it in awhile, but I'm petty sure it does work on a single enemy and aim for the torso/head. The bonus effect becomes nullified in groups of enemies when the splash damage hits another enemy that is not the main tartget.
---
Would be cool if Bethesda fixed it so that explosive splash damage isn't counted as weapon damage, but a separate category like "effect damage" or "bonus damage" therefore not messing with your primary weapon damage.
---
But maybe it's also supposed to be a "flaw" with the legendary combination...? It just doesn't seem fair as the main purpose of furious is precision, to stack damage 5x on the same target to gain your bonus.
---
It's done, look at the event page. The banner's 'unlocked', after the beret leaves the shop in a few days the banner will likely take it's place
---
I noticed that too. Still doesn't make up for the wall shenanigans.
---
Unyielding would be awesome! I saw Angry Turtle's video on how to power level from 1 to 50 and he was using level 1 unyielding. I was like, yeah, how am I supposed to get that? Lol. I enjoy helping low level players. The ones who don't expect anything are the best. They appreciate it more. üôÇ
---
Np

Collect the most pertinent suggestions from the community here and become a direct postman who delivers them in paper form to the studio directly.
---
I wasn't affected. But I know a couple of co-players who were :/
---
+1000 carry weight is what I want
---
no worries, got the problem solved
---
Same issue here. Crashes to desktop every single time. It‚Äôs been happening since the update, though with not as much frequency as today.
---
Fixer with .38 Auto receiver, stinging magazine, stock for bashing to increase durability of gun, long recon scope.
---
I, too, enjoy LMGs. 
---
It‚Äôs great when I fast-travel to NAR Repair Yard and see a sheepsquatch. I can down it in less than half a clip sometimes.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. Never seen this.
---
Put MIRV on it and make sure you have demo expert perk cards turned on.  Your weapon is not as useless as you think.  Not practical, but fun if used correctly.
---
Every bloodied stealth commando ever
---
You realize they can't just add shit to the game on the fly right?  This emote would have been sitting in the game files since at least the last update just waiting for them to release it.
---
I ran into someone like that, he happened to be behind me. So I asked if anyone was stupid enough to buy his ammo. He didn't respond, so I continued "that's okay, you don't have to answer because I already know no one does."
---
Why even bother tbh? All the plans from the provisions you can get the other way, there is nothing special, nothing rare. Just a way to mess up your space.
---
FED76 has a solid pricing tool, albeit based on PC. It tends to overestimate, but is a handy quick reference to see possible demand.
---
I just want to say, your English is better than my anything-other-than-English. The notes from /u/TheIllustriousJabba look correct to me, but I didn't do well in High School so what do I know?
---
But honestly if English is not your first language, never apologize for trying. You were able to get your point across, you helped a fellow redditor, and you did it in someone else's language. Continue kicking ass and taking names.
---
Reset for daily quests is around 7 or 8pm EST unlike the daily challenges which change around 12 noon EST. Gold bullion, scrip, and vendor caps reset 20 hours after your first exchange of the day. I have not figured out Smiley's rotation yet since they changed it to monday.
---
Another note is dailies don't show up until you visit that biome or sometimes speak to the quest giver. Some biomes have multiple dailies possible so you might not get the same one two days in a row.
---
Best wait until Dec. Devs are working from home currently.
---
Go to the roof of West Tek.  There's one that is a guaranteed spawn up there by a chair/paint - Unless someone else has looted it by the time you get there of course.
---
but i have 8k cork so...
---
Well if you get a screen shot and upload to any free image hosting page you can link that here. 
---
Without more info it‚Äôs hard to know exactly what is happening. 
---
When you level up are you selecting strength and then a card I strength? Or are you actually selecting a different category and then picking a strength card?
---
Yep, you were right. I'm a dum-dum for not checking, but I guess my cynical side assumed it was related to patch 21.
---
I can confirm you get 500 atoms reaching rank 100. Just got it today!
---
Definitely trying this when i get home! What is the rug trick though?
---
So do all quests then when you have to decide just pick. I kept all gold and yes I lost rep. But then there was the raider rep glitch which is still possible I believe so I got rep after like 3 weeks or whatever then settlers there wasn‚Äôt a glitch so I just did pictures and wards daily and sometimes random encounters and made the slow slow slow slow slow crawl and finally got it. The rep doesn‚Äôt go down that much. But it is a unbelievable slow crawl for the rep.
---
Corn soup rules. üåΩüåΩüåΩüåΩ
---
I'd keep it and chamber it in .38 with a powerful automatic receiver. I'd use it to clear enemies that aren't bullet sponges, spending the free .38 ammo that you find all over the map üëç
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call it babying. Steel is the most common resource in the game. Cork and concrete are pretty rare by comparison. Lowering them is just being realistic. 
---
It will probably happen
---
Well yeah you can get them for free from the West Tek roof
---
 https://imgur.com/TwvwroF
---
Lucky you
---
Idk but the furious explosive automatic railway rifle I have is pretty much vats crits everytime. It‚Äôs a beast
---
Damn it‚Äôs still high-priced?  I‚Äôd give you my copy, but it‚Äôs a digital download.
---
Did you go out of your way to collect that much? My stash has just been from playing the game naturally. And how much gametime do you have logged?
---
Ok.  Idk I guess.
---
They lowered it to 15 million yesterday evening my time. We got the reward it is coming in a day or two.
---
I wear the dress too! It‚Äôs technically the most OP outfit in the game with it‚Äôs +1 to Perception.  
---
But I just like the way my max-muscle, long-haired Grognak character looks in it ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Yeah, on PlayStation it still goes for 60$ with no discounts and 40-30$ with discounts. 
---
Haha I appreciate the offer my man, but don‚Äôt worry about it. I don‚Äôt have any problems paying for it I‚Äôm just patiently waiting until it goes cheap because I‚Äôm not in a hurry to play it, 76 is occupying most of my time now
---
I got one the other day. Wanted to display it in my camp. While still traveling about I had to scarf some food and water. I made a mistake and ate it. It wasnt about the pie, it was that it came from that damned machine.
