I deserve the downvotes

Whitespring is still a popular nuke site so be prepared to log out when there is a launch targeting your homestead. OTW have fun.

Hardly standard.  And there's no way they're releasing the software for the game, much less the server software, it would be cracked in a day and pirated, not to mention gone over with a fine tooth comb for exploits on the retail servers.

And it didn't exactly work out for him, and being versed in cqc even in person I wouldn't be I danger unless he was armed with a gun, in person. At no point did I say I was concerned for my safety, just concerned by his obviously fragile mental state. Try and rationalize it all you want kiddo but this sort of interaction was definitely someone suffering from one or more psychoses at once. If you've never acted before, which I am going to put myself out there and bet the last time you "acted" was lying to go to a friend's party after curfew, you'd know that even delving into a roleplayed "persona" any person, even professional paid actors can't keep up 10 solid minutes of screeching without a) taking a break between takes to keep the voice fresh and B) not break and laugh at the ridiculousness, as even actors that have graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic arts can have trouble keeping in severe character.

I’d only put one point in Demolition Expert, max.  You should hit for 2,000+ on a regular vats head shot with a proper build.  Demolition expert add 4% (total damage) for the first point, and only 2% for each additional point.  So it’s not very good.

Good question. Following real principles, it is and so are flamers. In-game flamers are not energy, even though fire is really energy. The Gauss rifle is in real life a projectile weapon, but in game they are considered energy because of the charge up to fire. Explosive weapons like grenades and rockets shouldn't be affected, and neither should Explosive prefix legendaries.
---
I'd be happy with the legendary shotgun I had in new Vegas. Its legendary effect was to highlight dead bodies with a red outline.
---
I've got one very similar that a queen dropped for me. I just have +250 DRWR on it instead of RW. 
---
As for .308 consider switching to ultracite .308. Yes it takes flux and a bit more materials to make but you get back 178 with ammosmith 2 and that's without super duper.
---
Making private servers has nothing to do with the atomic shop team
---
Instigating Lever 1-shots up to a level 68 2* Supermutant without a critical.  With a crit head shot, you 1-shot a 3*.  So an Instigating Lever is the best in slot weapon for a Rifleman Sniper build.  The IE handmade is great for tight areas though.  The QE, VE, or AAE handmade are other solid options.  
---
The .50 Hunting rifle absolutely sucks compared to the lever.  That said, I have an 3* IE Hunting Rifle I’ll sell for 100K if you’re buying.  😜
---
Yeah they do exist. They used to spawn at vendors, but after that one update, I don't know anymore. It might have gotten much rarer. I know you could get Scout Armor mods in the Enclave events, so perhaps you could get Enclave Plasma mods too? I've never gotten any out of the 100 or so times I've done them. Just Scout armor, armor mods, unique outfits, and Enclave plasma guns. 
---
My current fav plasma is my Junkies Plasma with 10% aim damage. Does much more damage than my Quad and 2 Shot Plasma. Need to get me an Anti Armor one someday, and pray they add in Enclave Plasma legendaries one day.
---
Thanks for this, couldnt find any info on this anywhere!
---
I'm on ps4 IkarosBonghits
---
I believe Explosive is its own damage type. No clue what flamers deal. Gauss rifle actually does ballistic damage, but is counted as energy in terms of ammo weight reduction and crafting.
---
Flechette harpoon gun is a great heavy weapons shotgun.
---
&gt;I'm no gun expert but I think it could maybe be made from a modified auto grenade launcher?
---
The one from metro is a modified heavy machine gun. Closest equivalent in this game would be a shotgun reciever for the .50 machine gun.
---
Luckily it's just far away enough that I can walk into the blast zone but it never gets hurt.
---
&gt; You want a tense deathmatch to a quick end with other players (Survival mode)
---
IIRC this mode was removed right?
---
Hey guys how do you like this 'content' they have been coming out with? These additions are baby-sized in scope and the cash shop is disgusting. $1 for a pip boy reskin? $5+ for outfits ported from Fallout 4?  
---
I personally don't think they get slammed enough for this practice. Guys, I get you like the game and the concept in general, but they really are screwing you here. The more money people put into this game the more okay it makes it for them to act like this.  
---
I was really looking forward to private servers. Knowing I can't host it myself despite having the hardware is just a disappointment. Many games have this, why can't Fallout 76?
---
FFR only increases your rate from 5 to 6.  Instigating Exploding is definitely the best in slot sniper rifle, but it’s also SUPER rare and worth over 100K. I will pay 100K for any IE Lever if anyone is selling.
---
Oops, just scrapped one.
---
Agreed.  Vampires is great on a handmade too.
---
For sniping no doubt, but in the middle of mobs quadruple is best so you don’t run out of bullets.
---
Check the trading sub, I’ve seen that kind of gun go for less than that.
---
This is a bug, it still happens when nobody is ontop of something! The only fix was to catch her with a pacify back when they let you hit scorch beasts with it, which alas they removed that feature!
---
Yep. Works great. I can swap an entire loadout quicker than changing a single perk without the mod.
---
You can both get one if they spawn as an item.
---
I found one too but they wanted 7500 caps. I thought that was a bit too much. I'm glad you found it!
---
Find someone selling an IE Lever for under 100K. If so, I’ll buy it and give you a finders fee. 
---
I’ve been offered 60K +40 weapons for my IE Lever, and I turned the trade down.  I’ve had QE Levers, etc.  I’d rather have IE so I 1-shot everything. That, or a BE Lever. I’ve pretty much owned every lever type in the game, and that’s what works for me.
---
No mountain lions in West Virginia...oh wait no snally gasters either..I think a new batch of creatues would be nice though
---
This can happen at any nuke launch position, and even if nobody is ontop of something, it is a game glitch since launch!
---
For me it’s a better version of my modded fallout 4 with lots of cooking grinding thanks to hunters moon(or all the radstags in herds 12 deep in the toxic valley?!+butchers bounty 3?) not just that, but just one thing in example!
---
Good luck I've seen them go for 1000 a piece
---
If private servers are a thing there is a good chance mods will. Bethesda even said they expressed interest in it when 76 released. So it’s not impossible
---
Microtransactions in a game like this are good because they let the devs keep making great content for the fans to enjoy! I don't understand what's so difficult to get here
---
I bought two copies ($120) pre-order, only to have it drop in the following weeks. I don’t care WHAT the reason was, I was kinda salty over it. The game wasn’t well balanced, I was constantly running out of ammo, and wasn’t having -fun-...you know, what you vine here for? 
---
I picked it back up a month ago and it’s been well re-balanced, but man, I see where OP is coming from.
---
Support does things? I couldn't start the pioneer scouts missions for some unknown reason and when I reached out to support they told me they'd look into it
---
yikes, i actually had someone message me on here and gave me over 100 for free! i insisted on paying and giving stuff away, he said no thanks, what a nice guy
---
Companion, health Regen and junk creators
---
It does look awesome. The scout mask also blends nicely with the medical goggles. Now if i could just get the US mask to drop...
---
What a bunch of little bitches, downvoting me. Get the fuck over yourselfs. Lmao! I can't wait to see the demise of this game at this point.
---
If u was on xb1 i could give u that mod free i get thoes mods from diff events.
---
i did not read any of this
---
Just found like 6 of them at once in whitesprimgs from raider vendor bout to delete thread but thx
---
Scout mask + Welding Helmet makes for another great combo
---
Is this a troll?
---
And you wouldn't? Well we know who has actual humanity here in this equation. Hint: it's not you. Now toddle on child so I can actually read people's stories and not your cantankerous retorts for attention that you appear to be starved for.
---
I keep finding broken cameras.  Can I repair those?
---
Try it with a vintage nukashine!
---
PS4 is the only console I can manage. Everytime I get a PC, it dies. So I need something that can handle my anti-electronic touch.
---
Plasma grenade plan is near the top of that list.
---
I recently watched a video If I find it I’ll link it but it just entails why things are the way they are with them now seems  they are going through a set up for a buyout and it’s a really is interesting, but after watching it I kinda just went numb.  And well, here we are.
---
Yeah how much you wanna buy?
---
It’s $16 right now lmfao that’s a price drop bud. 
---
I’m stating facts, where you’re clearly posting from an emotional position trying to defend the game.  
---
Here’s some advice- you can admit a game isn’t good but that you like it AT THE SAME TIME.  I’ll give you an example- I fucking love the game Battleborn, but ultimately it failed and has almost a non existent player base now. 
---
Try it out I promise you wont spontaneously combust or something
---
I bet you never heard from them again😂
---
Basically if an event pops up you should do it. They all have a small percentage to reward plans, some of them extremely rare. For example, Tea Time, one of the most hated events, can reward the Tomahawk plan like all Forest events
---
Wow, finally, a reason to wear my scout armor mask, hehe.
---
All scopes are fine because you don't actually have  your gun displayed on screen. The issue pointed is, even the little green dot on holographic sights are invisible because they made everything being invisible.
---
Looking for marsupial and speed demon. Any other good ones for sale would be dope to. But mostly those 2
---
For me all 3 is pretty much mandatory since I am running I thin 9 mutations.  Don't judge it is an addiction.  Decide what mutations you want and decide how much of the negative you can stand.
---
“price drop very early on”
---
“It’s $16 right now”
---
Facts, right? You just proved my entire point so... thanks I guess.
---
It’s decent. You running heavy explosive build?
---
[removed]
---
Simple list. Shielded Casual/Marine/Raider Ultracite gatling laser plans only from distant thunder(really any cranberry event but I have gotten 3 from it).
---
But the rarest and hardest to get especially a full set for yourself: Any T-45,T-51,T-60 buildable armor piece. Though T-51b is the easiest one to get since you can get it as an event reward also where as the other ones well you have to have luck and be a good hunter.
---
Reminds me the time I used some transparent paper on my screen with many dots for various distances x)
---
Turning off the high quality water really helped for me.
---
I can’t tell you how many times I killed a legendary and either it was a robot that blew up or a nearby car blew up and my legendary took a trip into the next county. But some sort of identification system for dead legendaries would be helpful.
---
https://youtu.be/qJt_i2_vsSw
---
Jesus, were you like at ground zero at Chernobyl or something? I’ll definitely consider it then, thanks a bunch for the info
---
All the Shotgunner perks in Strength for damage. Skeet Shooter in Perception will tighten up the spread and accuracy. Enforcer in Agility is nice as well for taking out knee caps but I usually only throw it on when I run into a bat and a couple shots will cripple its wings and bring it down for you to finish it off up close.
---
Just put a sticker on your screen lol.
---
Coming from somebody who has a stealth based  rifle build, I would love this, but I'm sure everybody else would hate it. I've always viewed it as a balance issue. Up close stealth combat with a short rifle and a sight I could auctally use would make it too easy.
---
It is nice for events like SBQ and Imposter Sheep Squatch because it will help out the other players around you by reducing the enemy damage. For other fights where you are solo, it isn't as much of a benefit. If you don't have a better one then I would say keep it until you get an AA Explosive or Furious Explosive, something like that.
---
If only I wasn't at work :(
---
Careful what you wish for, look at what the sheep can do.
---
Without atom shop have as a random drop for either capturing or defending the Ammo Depot. 
---
As Atomic shop it'll probably be another 700 atoms, which whatever I got over 2000 from just challenges
---
It sounds like you dont "get it" at all.  Games as a service change dramatically over time from their launch date.  You say it hasn't changed at all, but even the changes to world events and how people interact with them are pretty substantial.  
---
Either you ignore how this game has evolved, or you have a strange disillusionment about how you perceive the game.
---
Maybe he was going to safe keep them for you but it kicked off the server.    Yeah probably not.
---
I feel your pain. I do the same thing and recently lost a lot of good stuff in much the same way.
---
I guess that would break the balance of some recipes
---
Were you junk sorting in a workshop? Maybe had someone on your team who initiated PvP against them? Those are the only ways to flag yourself for pvp
---
What system you on?
---
Good luck trying to sleep, that dude got em! ;) (kidding man)
---
3* Ninja and 3* Covert Operative = 3.5x Sneak damage with fist weapons. Even before throwing Bloodied into the mix up it is beast damage.
---
Well bethesda retracted the "cosmetic only" statement. So, I'm sure we will get nothing but paid for necessity items now.  
---
Why work on a new quest for an item or have a chance to earn the item when you can just spend 10 bucks? Right?
---
First thing that comes to mind every time I hear full health is a junkies build.
---
I had a bag disappear before my eyes. I would never do it this way. Wouldn't even cross my mind. I would enlist a friend to help. And planning on hopping on in a bit to do exactly this. He's stuck, he's gonna create a mule. He'll transfer the stuff to me, mule will log in and I'll pass back. Seems like the safest way. 
---
Sorry you lost your stuff. That really sucks.
---
Whenever that may be, Rodgers.
---
I worked for Walmart when it originally went on sale for $40 USD. It never went back up in price after BF. Less than a year into launch and the game gets a 33% price drop? Definitely not a good thing.
---
You can in first person too, just swap weapons and then swap back. Stupid fix but works, keeps the weapon visible while rest of the body is camouflaged
---
Thats RNG for ya. People expect to get only good stuff
---
I'm on PC.
---
to what end?
---
seems like the same RNG to me.. I dont think there is any conspiracy going on
---
Something like that.  I recently started an alt and it is almost unbearable not having speed demon and marsupial.
---
Stupid fix but it works, just swap weapons and then swap back. keeps the weapon visible while rest of the body is camouflaged
---
You're either incapable of understanding this concept, or just being intentionally dense, either way I think we're done here.
---
Making mule accounts always felt like duping the game.
---
I'd take a maroon, liner removed, cardboard slightly trimmed, and fuzz shaved off.
---
Corcoran's as well.
---
Sure, but is that wrong?  What good is a sale if you only get the stuff you won't use?
---
Holographic sight are a little dot of light projected by the red dot itself, why would they become invisible in the first place if your pipboy is still able to cast some light? There was no logical thinking behind that. They just coated everything except for scopes point of view. If that was logical scopes should be invisible too because the reticle is physical and marked on a glass part, unlike holographic/red dot sights that project a little laser into the glass.
---
That's even more weird when you think about how an Enclave agent for exemple would be able to work with a stealthboy if he isn't able to see himself or his tools.
---
Its not advertised as better odds
---
There are Civil War battlefields nearby - Antietam or Gettysburg would be great for these or team battles.
---
Do u run a junkie build
---
Yes, would appreciate this QoL. Glow green the WHOLE time. Or would that be too annoying?
---
Thanks. I'm a Bloodied build and die instantly from Pylons. At least I can drain its health quicker than most and simultaneously kill all Mr Gutsys and Eye bombs.
---
Don't know why its 50% for you. I dump about 6 or 8 plasma cores onto the sbq with my two shot gatling plasma and always get loot.
---
With companions coming in the new add on this might be part of their plan.
---
I'd hope they have human/ghoul, animal, and build-a-bot companion options, potentially using different stats for each  (char for humanoid, int for bots, and maybe endurance or char for animals).
---
It's definitely just RNG. I've gotten some amazing weapons the last few days.
---
If you did this at a workshop... Why were you sorting your junk at one of the only guaranteed PVP locations in the game? Do it at your CAMP... As long as you don't, you know, drop your junk in a paper bag or something, it's as safe as can be.
---
if you were at your CAMP, did you have any of the mutations or armor that retaliate and can trigger PVP?
---
Check Watoga vendors--- you should be able to find several plans. Just make sure to only buy the "gatling" versions.  :)
---
I Always encounter it where hee health goes back up again. I expect it. Are you saying thats a glitch?
---
Damn it. PS4 here. I was going to offer to go scaving with you and rebuild your junk stash. 2 people = twice the carry weight.
---
Well, all I can offer is an apology and a best of luck to you. Doesn't change anything but maybe it'll soften the blow.
---
I expected a full game when I bought it but got a buggy messy game is that stupid consumer att?
---
It's all random, like usual. I rolled a decent two-star exterminator explosive Fixer, but the 800 points I spent on armor was total garbage. I still made out better than I expected with the one good piece.
---
I got a few great items. I've recorded every drop and I don't see any obvious bamboozling- seems like the usual rng.
---
I would just patch the game make it a basic feature of all tinker benches since it would be dumb as fuck for it to be locked behind any kind of wall since we start the game knowing how to make almost every ammo type from scratch anyway. 
---
As for the atom shop it should simply not be in it at all.
---
But agree to disagree
---
&gt;I'd prefer to see a base game Ammo Converter workbench(maybe quested), with skins in the atom shop(wouldn't hurt to make a few quested ones too ie "more content").
---
This. You have an atom skin for each faction, raiders, BOS, all that. Maybe a robot "skin" that functions the same but is a robot that stands in your camp. A bloody one, a clean one, one that looks like it is a hillbilly workstation, one that it military. Sell em for $2 each or get a bundle of all them for $20.
---
Fuck yeah, you ready to play bro?!
---
Hell to the yes!
---
What's your tag?
---
Yup. Happened to me a few times today. Probably server lag

Took me less than a minute to find contradictory statements on this very sub from several months ago. Just search “walmart”.
---
Again, this is exactly why asking people here is pointless. This sub is toxic and its the community’s fault. There’s no reason for this post to get this many responses over something that doesn’t even matter now.
---
Yes. Since day 1. Ive tried a bunch of fixes and nothing has worked

Super_POG
---
Ill be home in 10 minutes brotha
---
Use the cash register in the red rocket up north, unlimited space and next to a stash box. 
---
I’ve gotten f’ed many times doing this method bc of disconnects :/ 
---
We need a way to transfer between toons
---
I really appreciate that you'd do that for a stranger like me. Even if you are on a different system, it does make me feel better about the community as a whole :)
---
For ammo converter here’s what I’d do:
---
Allow anyone to use if unlocked
---
Flat rate for conversion via caps
---
Also ability to convert to flat lead and gunpowder
---
Baseline model 500 atoms.  One mans $5 is another’s weeks atoms
---
Sell faction skins for 500 more atoms
---
Basically those that want one get it, it’s not a lot of work to get for free, and you can customize it for your preferenced style. 
---
Bethesda will never do this.  The one calling atom shop shots is obviously schizophrenic and has yet to figure out how the hell to run it consistently.
---
Omg. I will NOT run that event if 90% of the people are trying to shoot the imposter while hes invisible.
---
There’s double the reason to wear it now that they’re super rare!
---
Learn how to manage your health, just because you are a bloodied build doesn't mean you have to have 20% health all the time. Power armor and first aid and field surgeon perks will go a long way towards helping keep you alive. Showing up and planning on not trying to get even one pylon is just asking for the government cheese. You're not really helping.
---
Maybe some other thyme then
---
Yup, 1000 atoms pls
---
Don't let one pothole ruin the entire trip. We're all in this together. :)
---
No, and a lot.
---
In the previous Fallout games? At a time combats were using a turn system, and a 2D view. Now that you mention it, these Fortnite-esque request ruined Fallout, why developers add recent mechanics and kill their games for casual players D:.
---
You know, because something "works fine" doesn't mean it can works better. How does allowing a little green dot of light that is projected on a glass is ridiculous? I mean, on PC at least you were able to mod previous Fallout to run some new things, add better animations, new tech (took me 2sec to find that picture-in-picture scopes is a mod on FalloutNV https://youtu.be/0U6KcFF1hOIdoes it looks so "ridiculous"?).
---
I'm not in the Fortnite fanbase as well, but dude you need to open your mind and not aim at a newer game to justify a conservative opinion.
---
Without going bloodied it seems like the most powerful build.
---
Wow they still havent fixed this
---
Completely agree. Getting it from a quest and then buying skins for them. Hope this happens
---
Sweet picture!
---
Thank you, had this event pop up earlier for the first time in a long time, I'm the lowest level there and nobody else is activating pylons, and while I die repeatedly their shooting his invisible ass
---
I would but it says I have to shoot a cat and I can't bring myself to do it, plus I'm scared that even though you're supposed to keep them alive after shooting them at least long enough to collect the data, the poor thing will end up dead all because of me.
---
It collects junk for you.
---
What’s the Vox?
---
I'm usually on after 6pm Mountain time in the states. my gamertag is Gonerboy.
---
As long as it doesn't hurt Chally. If it feels less like a pre-war mosquito and more like a post-war stingwing, we'll have to find another way.
---
I'll remind that for tomorrow, thanks :)
---
Yeah I know, I'm an idiot. I don't enjoy PvP stuff in online games so I don't look into their mechanics, I never go looking for any fights. 
---
I've just used Workshops as a 'free' quick travel spot for an evenings play, and sometimes to harvest some ore, but I didn't know the rules change while you're in the area. I assumed it was the same as rest of the server where I've never had any trouble from anyone, so I didn't even think anything could happen while I made room in my stash.
---
Are you just trying to scrap them for the mods?
---
Nope.  Check back Q1 2020.
---
I’m doing a plasma flamer type build, but can’t find a plasma gun
---
Then it should make the crosshair disappear too, since it's meant to cloak everything including what allows you to aim.
---
Alright, so even with Perk the Loadout mod it's not worth it?
---
I hate noobs soo much at this moment its not funny. Was doing a legendary run thru whitesprings. was getting awsome 3* legendary items after i had got done doing my farm run i go to look at everything i got. and they were all lvl 35 Wtf this is why noobs dont belong in our areas.
---
The wasteland is unforgiving. Just gotta keep trucking friend.
---
This. I play bloodied unarmed and there is no problem with this event. Get your health  up to 3/4 take the pylon  and make your way to the imposter. You can spam stims between whacks and if there are others there doing damage it will be over quick. If you die just rinse and repeat.
---
I don't know about mods. I'm just an Xbox player.
---
Oh okay. I know you can get them from treasure maps a lot. That’s how I got all the mods learned for plasmas. But if you’re just looking for one plasma then you can buy the plan from Phoenix in Watoga Shopping Center.
---
This might sound overly simple, but have you checked your setup on your actual TV, and not the console? Mine was cut off, and it was my TV doing it. A couple of clicks and I fixed it.
---
Whats yours?
---
I'm really just curious what lead you to think a day goes by in 10 minutes.
---
Thanks, this is very useful information. :)
---
If everybody can use it I don't see how they would hate it. I mean, people can already insta vats heads with auto rifle, how could allowing a player to aim with his sight unbalance things?
---
Horde events where you kill everything but the horde legendary. Keep the legendary alive &amp; other 3 stars will spawn
---
One violent night, don't rush,  take 20 minutes then multiple legendaries should spaen
---
mind if I ask which event you get t-51 plans for?
---
I finally found you!
---
Ah, no worries, mate. Thanks anyway. :)
---
Quite simply I just think if you go completely invisible then everything must be invisible, it currently isn’t impossible to shoot targets while using a stealth boy. You could even use third person POV. The crosshairs have helped, these types of requests in my eyes are people just asking to be spoon fed.
---
Online now
---
I'm a bloodied build as well and rin all 3 pylons so I stand by what I said. Having a bloodied weapon and low health isnt a bloodied build. You need survivability perks.
---
I've also heard the underarmor plans (Casual, at least) drop from Savage Divide events as well.
---
With the right perks and effects, they rock. You wont be the king of kings, but any láser rifle can get the job done. My commando uses an automatic láser rifle sometimes. They don't break as fast as people say they do. 
---
Problem Is crafting ammo. But if you already are the kind of guy who pays for 556 or 308, then, you'll have no problems. Otherwise, copper Is a bitch.
---
What is the outfit/armor with the tire pauldrons?
---
People still do that event?
---
I never drop bags. I find a box that's not in a well traveled area. Sorry for your loss tho bro, that's shitty as it gets.
---
The vox does no damage so it won't die. It'll just start talking. Otherwise you're stuck with it.
---
I've been bloodied for 1 year and I'm level 280. I know what I'm doing and I'm not going to spam stims the whole time.
---
I think I've had mine since Beta days, just couldn't bring myself to get rid of it, was kinda cool.... Lol
---
Just don’t put beam splitter on it, that’s what makes them break so fast
---
NMS had to do what they did to keep that train wreck alive.  Some of the others did it for marketing purposes and its not like FO76 has not had any content added since launch.  How many of those are actually online multiplayer, and I don't mean coop games or Civ.
---
For Fallout 4, I downloaded the Nate companion mod (will be careful to avoid spoilers for any who have yet to play the game). I put himself and my character in power armor to do a certain quest. I forget what weapon my character had equipped, but he had a .44 pistol. We're sneaking with weapons drawn, I look back to see if he's still following, and I nearly burst out laughing at this big, hulking power armor suit crouched with some puny looking little gun drawn. Felt like I owed him an apology for that.
---
If you were at a workshop organising your junk, with all of it on you, you were practically offering yourself for sacrifice. 
---
I don't pvp, but... You have learned a valuable lesson today. Workshops are More dangerous than scorched Earth nowadays.
---
Guess I'm shooting a kitty next time I'm on. Apologies in advance, Fluffy!
---
I showed up to one with around 90 seconds left, dude was full health and everyone shooting at him invisible, did all 3 pylons and pulled out my AAE Gatling Laser with 30 seconds or so left, got him down to a sliver before he disappeared after time ran out... Everyone had left when there was 30 seconds still on the clock thinking it wasn't doable I guess... Had just 1 person stayed we would have had it... Don't leave early when you think it's gonna fail please...
---
Don't worry, soon you'll be able to rent your own private server from Bethesda so other peoples fun won't get in the way of your online multiplayer game!
---
In before some beta says to play on console.

u/raptorking202 The last time I had a harmless creature like a rabbit as a target I killed it...

World objects have a **per-character lockout**, based on a history list, instead of time. Each character has a list of 180 most-recently-looted world objects, and a list of 60 most-recently-looted containers. A character must loot enough new things to push old things off their list, before the old things become available again.

You aren't helping by trying to suggest things that don't fit my build. Power armor when I have WWR Unyielding? I trade weapons and I'm at 520 carry. As a Bloodied build I 1 hit all enemies at the event, I'm the crowd control. It's not my job to pylon. I run with a team and we share any and all health sharing/healing cards. Anyways, my squad does not fail the event as long as the game doesn't crash. Our damage dealer is a Bloodied meathook doing 8k a hit, plus we drop queens in minutes and server hop. It's called teamplay. I'm not running pylon, but that doesn't mean I'm not helping 100%.
---
With the vox?
---
Get a crossbow and take out some super mutants. Add in scrapper perk. Lumberyard and Westek come to.mind, but Westek might give you some issues with a crossbow ;)
---
Yup
---
The queen of the hunt works for me but I haven't been able to do the big game hunt in over a week
---
That's weird. In my experiences the vox doesn't do damage.
---
I don't even remember the last time I saw it pop up.
---
🙁 Poor bun...
---
xXDreamYetiXx
---
Wait! Someone just told me otherwise. So it might do damage.
---
I run S3 for blocker, P15, E4 for fireproof and radicool C5 for lone wanderer and tenderizer1, I6 for 3 nerdrage and 3 gunsmith ... then I think A9 action girl 3, covert 3, gun fu 1, adrenaline 1, evasive 1 and rest in L14.starched Gene 2, class freak 3, bloody mess 3, serendipity 3 ... I run grim reapers sprint 3 usually but sometimes move those around.
---
Maybe it was just a fluke, idk, I’d have to retest it on anything but a cat
---
I mey be a (whale) but i perfer the multiplayer server vs buying a solo server or opening a public server like ARK.
---
I'll probably test it again as well then.
---
Good job! Would love to visit that some day!
---
Yeah I said in another reply, I know I'm an idiot. I dislike PvP at the best of times so I didn't know the ins-and-outs of it, and I'd never had a problem in a workshop before so I didn't know that could happen. I'm just pissed off that I've lost every crafting item I owned because of it.
---
Join my server, ill hook you up....what level are you
---
Yeah, I saw. Would be nice if, when we reject daily quests, they stay removed from our pipboy until we actually go out of our way to start those quests again.
---
Raider for sure, I have not seen personally a casual from any savage divide event.
---
Does science perks affects the weapon's usage from your point of view? It shouldn't since it's not written on the card, but what if that was the case :o
---
Also, laser weapons have a better hipfire accuracy from what I've experienced (plus the ammo capacity is affected by the barrel, that mean you can use it as a non auto rifle with hight capacity without having to deal with extra weight for hi-cap mag and semi receiver that deals better damage).
---
☠️ RIP
---
Sure, distant thunder. Took me somewhere in the 40s to get the complete set.
---
No difference. Get it where it's cheap. I got the digital copy when it came out and bought a "hard" copy from Amazon for $18 for a mule account. The game is the same on both.
---
Yeah. With some of them they go away after 24 hours but others don't.
---
server hop west tek and scrap all the weapons. Snag yourself a mix and match set of crap armor with weapons weight reduction and  you can server hop 5-6 times without being overweight. If you can get your hands on a guns and bullets 5 it allows you to get more mats from scrapping which also stacks with scrapper. 
---
When I need steel I'll ask a couple friends to do the hops with me and will I'll hold all the weapons so they aren't overweight. I think the last time we did it in a team of three after 5 hops with scrapper and the magazine we had 6k steel and 1100 plastic.
---
Not for a digital download.
---
I don't understand the point of logging out. It's not like you  an initiate pvp for stealing someone's loot bag. In a civilized society we don't take their bag. It can be any level of a player. Big or small. They will take someone's loot bag if they are uncivilized. Had a level 150 take the loot bag out of a level 10. I mean come on, there's nothing you need from a level 10 that you don't have already.

[Fallout 76 price drops](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pcgamer.com/amp/fallout-76-drops-in-price-again-to-dollar35/) 
---
it literally dropped a week after launch, and has gone down since. Whatever helps you sleep at night lmfao just admit the game is bad. Jesus Christ the fucking fan boys in this sub are hilarious
---
Weird. Just did that one about an hour ago with no issue. The one that keeps screwing up for me is the Breach and Clear event. All the containers are empty for the entire event. Grrrrr.
---
As a weightless Cham mutant I support this message
---
And again, the week later you’re referring to was a black friday sale. 
---
At least look at the date on the article before you post, you make yourself look stupid.
---
Now you’re talking shit in circles; AND you already were told this.
---
Want people to take you seriously? Get a single argument and stick with it. You’ve bounced around three times now. I don’t even have to try. Your posts alone are the perfect example of why you can’t listen to people on this sub. Half are full of shit and the other half are drinking the koolaid. The half who are full of shit always retreat to the “you’re on Bethesda’s side wahhhhh!!” argument.
---
They’ve already taken notice on this issue
---
&gt;Sad sidenote - one butler had damaged legs, and was dragging itself on the driveway slowly, still welcoming me to the Whitespring. That's dedication.
---
I can't tell if that's better or worse than the "walking" sentry bot I saw at Whitesprings. Back wheel was rolling. Front two were moving like it's a protectron instead. Only ever saw that happen once, but it was creepy as fuck and I don't ever want to see it again.
---
Herd mentality just works for you.
---
Empath works for you on both.... sides?  But as it is percentage I’m not sure how they add up.
---
You get the empath +damage from yourself and -damage from your friends but as far as I can tell it only works once.  So you take 33% more from your mutation but you take 25% less because of friends so it’s only 8% more, but that doesn’t include class freak and strange in numbers.  As I said the math seems to get weird.
---
Take home message is if you group a lot and run class freak, these are pretty much no downside mutations.  Bonus if you can share strange in numbers or class freak to your friends if they don’t have it.
---
This was my first thought too, check the aspect ratio on your TV.
---
ya rlly, u can use green thumb on those and get the 10 -- or any random 10 pumpkins u have in ur inventory
---
Im on xb1 and my screen doesent have that issue.
---
You’re focusing on the pricing because you can’t defend anything else lmao no good game drops like that after a week from launch, say it with me THE GAME IS BAD BUT YOU JUST LIKE IT
---
I am currently in support of this and have been wanting it for a while. If people have a reason that it should not please share.
---
What’s that? I’m focusing on the very thing that proves you’re full of shit? Why yes, that was the point. You contribute nothing.
---
Red Dead 2 went on sale for the exact same black friday.
---
Sucks. I did something like that once. There was a level 60 something making a brand new camp but they went idle. I was a level 10 doing a near by raid where a level 40 ghoul reaver came charging at me. Well I wasn't prepared so I took off towards him for help. Needless to say he died from being idle. After s few minutes after I killed the reaver I ended up getting his loot bag. Felt bad because I literally received 80 percent more loot than I initially had. Lots and lots of bulk. I messaged him over 5 times in the course of two weeks for me to drop it off back at him but he never responded. Would have done it too.
---
Tell me about it lol. Even got downvoted for keeping people in the loop. It's like they want me to throw heated coil mods and handmade rifle plans in one of the few accessible rivers or something lol
---
I dont get why people say bloodied builds are glass cannons. I made a second character rifle build where I usually sit anywhere around or above 50% hp and i wanted a weightless set which i have now but im taking significantly more dmg and dying more on this character then my other bloodied character where ill push 5% health and not worry about dying. Im considering just going bloodied on this character aswell (ones melee and this is a rifle build) just cause im familiar with it. On my main, (melee) Uny set usually or ill thro on a Bolst and Chameleon legs. Serendipity + nerd rage does wonders imo, i dont use Evasive or anything like that. Im sure there like glass cannons compared to a full heath vanguards armor set but i never tried that. I like to think everybody should be sneaking in this game. It would be the smart thing if this was IRL right? So if your sneaking your not really taking damage in the first place so wouldnt you be better off getting the benefits of being low health and uny armor. Sneak, Strength, endurance other benefits and even if you get caught you can re set crouch and usually avoid incoming dmg in the mids of a second. I don’t believe thats a guarantee with a full health build that has high agility, definitely not with my mid health Weightless set shenanigans i have going on, though i dont have shadowed and all the ultralight limb mods on this character yet.
---
On my main, a super mutant with a minigun can spray probably 500 rounds at me before i die, i got a clip of me walking around infront of one and you could barely see my health go down. The queen is the only thing that can really do dmg to me if it catches me, maybe a yao guai, and for some odd reason an unarmed scorched conqueror punching me in the back hits hard. I would say the imposter sheepsquatch too but usually with the right circumstance i can one hit them without regen.
---
So what i like about bloodied is the overall sneak bonus, but even without sneaking i dont even bother running up to the weaker enemies (anything thats not a boss) to kill them, istead troll them and walk up to them.
---
You might be wondering why im saying all this its because i like using snipers on this character, hunting rifle, lots of pipe weapons, no levers, and im on the verg of going bloodied regardless of dmg output but more about the dmg resistance. You got any idea what im doing wrong with this character? Should i ditch this weightless/sent set and hopefully comeplete this vanguards/wwr set soon? Or will that crush my sneaking abilities. Is half health with adrenaline not worth it considering the benefits of staying high health or the benefits of lower health? Depending on armor.
---
I'm insanely proud of some of my camps and they are way below your league here. Greatvstuff!
---
One cap per bullet at the vending machines.
---
Since there's no more survival mode, pvp players are back to use the places made for pvp. Same things happened to me after BGS announced survival ends.
---
Now I take workshop for the rewards, build/upgrade (better generators, etc) the collectors.
---
But the first thing I always do is placing a stash and a workbench. You never know what people want, even if you're peaceful, even if people can take anything in the workshop. We use a place made for pvp, we have to think of it. It's like trying  to test new stuff on a mmorpg on a pvp area. If you're not ready to engage/disengage/lost as little as possible, then avoid the area :/. People who wants to fight will fight.
---
I noticed that when people see my stash nd my workbench, they usually act friendly because they kow I have nothing on me. And if they want to take the workshop I let them do, it's okay I build collectors for people and myself, I'm not looking for their thanks if they take it the result is the same : I took the little I needed and people take as much as they need.
---
Awe. Well thank you so much! This is my end game.
---
Yes it's in the dawnguard dlc. You choose whether to join the vampires to remain with the dawnguard (vampire hunters)
---
I know this is tooting my own horn a bit, but not that long ago I ran across someone's camp and they had an open iron ore deposit right near them plus they were missing a few roof pieces, so I sent them a message offering to make them an extractor, plus the needed generators for it, and finish roofing their little hut. They accepted, I set up the extractor, finished the roof, then offered to craft more workbenches for them (which they declined, saying I'd done a lot for them already). I got so much more fun out of doing that than I'd ever get out of splattering some random strangers brains all over the wall of a workshop any day.

The game sucks and you know it
---
No good game prices drops like that, the reviews suck and the only thing full of shit is you not admitting the game is bad. To be delusional or a troll like you must be a blast though, can’t tell if you’re serious or just trolling at this point
---
You on pc? I can mod it for you tomorrow if you still need.
---
Can confirm, no cheaters on consoles.
---
Just cause you can shoot dosent mean you have to. Made a bunch of friends in survival.
---
They should be like this to prevent people from stealthy killing while the other guy has zero chance.
---
Strangler PA is op in pvp
---
Lordy. Looping again. Missing the entire point again. Not a single person in this entire chain was talking about the games quality- just that you lie about it.
---
Seriously, go do something with your life. There’s enough wrong with 76 that no one needs to make shit up.  Get a hobby, read a book. You got caught bullshitting, so what? It’s not the end of the world.
---
&gt;Tldr; took a shit in my hands and clapped.
---
RIP me.
---
I think this is a good idea. I often stream ESO and I am friend with a lot of ESO streamers and the general consensus is that drops are good for literally everyone including the game
---
Hell ya! Adventure is a murder fest and if people want peace they can play private.
---
I haven't seen any results of his "work". Is there any stash of his own loot? My own stash is not full, but i don't see any new junk whatsoever. He is just wandering around, that's all he does.
---
The event lags, so people are not in sync with the server.  Don’t think everyone is stupid or uncooperative, very few are.
---
Junkies sneaky commando is a ton of fun
---
Big Bend Tunnel works best for me. I can get 500 to 600 in one run. Use the scrapper perk.
---
b1-0s if anyone is looking for Fo76 buddy can add me. Do I need to be online?
---
I run a junkies commando build and the damage increase from junkies is great. At first, i really didnt want the drawbacks of the addictions but i quickly got use to it and realized that the withdrawl effects arent so bad. Its a +50% damage increase in the pipboy value but it is actually more than 50% due to the way the damage formula works
---
Like level 6 on pc!!!
---
Having redownloaded FO4 recently, I sometimes suspect FO4 of having better graphics than FO76.
---
 It was not always this way. For a long time, from the start, the regular scopes would go away as well, when you became invisible. The NV scopes always worked.
---
3 times today and 3 downvotes, perfectly balanced as all things should be.
---
If on PC, let me know if you are interested in selling or trading the TSE combat shotgun.
---
You need copper node in your camp if you use energy weapon or it will be hell.
---
Except bots don't turn into meat piles.
---
If you're able to use the "accurate" crosshair on 3rd person, you should be able to use the same "accuracy" on 1st person, or make every crosshair disappear while invisible. 
---
3rd person is a work around to this lack of detail. But if YOU are invisible, how does the colored LIGHT dot from your sight become invisible, unlike your pip boy that is still able to casts its light on every surface. 
---
This particular request is asked to balance things. It needs some works to let the little dot appear, but nobody asks it right now, this post is just here to point something that would be nice to fix.
---
It's not here to make the game easier. You can already full auto vats in the head, how allowing the player to aim with its sight will be a game changer?
---
Must’ve been a few months since you checked man, like close to 6 months, they nerfed TSE a long while ago.
---
If you do "Stings and Things" daily, this is the unmarked shack you are guided to to collect tick blood sacs.
---
wheres this at on the map anyhow?
---
I didn't know that, it's good to know that was not intentional and they fixed it so :)
---
Only prosnap camera DELUXE
---
I will just grab all pylons and kill imposter myself plus i will be grateful for whoever spend 2k caps to activate the event, that’s all Turtle out 🐢
---
Scrolled thru comments and did not see a game changer torso armor mod: Dense Robot Torso mod (plan? Idk) makes you practically immune to explosions from cars, sentry bots, and "scortchbeast blue ring" attack. This mod may be available for other armors, not sure.
---
Full health Rambo style unarmed build, feel free to check it out, it’s very fun for me i enjoyed making and using this build: https://youtu.be/F9OmHxl-hEs

Guy needs his own meme GoodGuyVendor
---
I need some toy breeds just so I can put "beware of dog" and then have some Pomeranian in a tutu bounce out from their doghouse and lick visitors to death.
---
I had to shoot a fox and instantly killed it, but I was in sneak though.
---
As an ex explosive build user - explosives have their own explosive damage category. This game does *not* categorise weapons by the types of damage they do but the medium that they are, eg., ballostic guns, energy guns, explosives. So, regardless of the explosives' damsge type, they are only treated as explosives and whatever modifers they get will modify both damage type. 
---
The only modifier I know of for explosives  is Demolition expert.
---
How much damage is this doing
---
Just don't expect it to be fallout. It only carries the name. Has A lot of bugs but most of the truly bad ones have been fixed or rarely appear. The death zone is one of the worst. If you notice your health dropping rapidly for no reason RUN! You might get lucky and get out of it in time. Building is A bit quirky. Watch some youtube on that and check here for how to get by problems. Often exiting the build menu and going back in resolves the problem with items that cannot be placed. And the build budget is A pain. I resorted to no roof and only walls that were needed to hang things to save build cap. Using A tent for sleeping quarters. There's tons of minor glitches like the ankle biters, enemies who cannot be killed. But those rarely affect game play. Most of us are hoping Wastelanders will make this game worth it. But it is playable and has A few good points. You can find my camp just west of Dyer Chemical at the falls.
---
Do you want to be invisible or not
---
They said they will be adding more "utility" items to the shop recently so I say that planters will be one of these utilities.
---
QA team would be nice. Better to delay than ship very buggy.
---
That's pretty awesome, I've come across some vendors like that, and I always buy way more than I was going to just because of how nice that is. Easily dropped 1k caps. 2 caps for missiles and mini nukes? Hells yeah
---
You can see it on the video, it can go higher with more food buffs (all melee dmg food stack) and gear with +1 strength, but what i have there is already enough to solo imposter, if not the fact that I forgot to drink nukashine that fight could be much faster.
---

You can add me on PC
---
I didn't know if u new off hand on the damage. Can't watch video until after work
---
could they be implemented? yup
---
should they be? imo no. community challenges imo are a much better option to have the community get free items.  im also very against putting stuff behind a single platform (especially one that is ran so bad)
---
also this was a thing:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9uqlhh/pete_hines_on_possibility_of_fallout_76_twitch/
---
I don’t remember exactly but it was about 500 per hit maybe more
---
That bug is long gone
---
Oh darn that’s a shame, thanks for the update :) 
---
It’s been a while since I’ve had a viable chameleon piece
---
Nice
---
The perfectly preserved pumpkin pies cure hunger much better. If you know where to get it.
---
Missing out if you don't, plans go for 15k+
---
Or instigating, no adrenal reaction to keep health even higher. I been doing a lot of stealth tests to see what works. What's nice about a full set of chameleon is if detected, you can lose mobs by stop and go. Something you can't do with unyielding. With a good mix you can get decent dr and er with the escape stutterstep. Muffled doesn't do anything better than ultralight, least from the tests I've done. You can have a heavy bos combat chest with dense and still have decent stealth this way. 4x ultralight + 1 shadowed, 1x dense. Sturdy frame seems to do nothing from tests too. I tried multiple shadowed armors, muffled seems obsolete by ultralight and escape artist imo.
---
The stutter worked on everything but the mobs during meat week, then you can build a vanguard set or a higher dr version of chameleon. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJGILxJTJ2M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJGILxJTJ2M)
---
Junkies is good too but thought put this out there, stealth + higher dr/er + instigating is no chems and efficient for ammo, repairs.
---
Also your point about wanting to be spoon fed is like saying to someone that his car engine doesn't start by turning the key "dude, you're asking to be spoon fed, starting it with wires helped until now, so stop asking how to repair your neiman and use the damn wires!".
---
Here you have a character that is able to see precisely where he's aiming on 3rd person without using vats, so he should be and he is able to aim, but on 1st person for you that's normal if he can't aim because "he is invisible, so, yeah." (without using a workaround). Life is full of contradictions.
---
Yeah i’ve noticed that too, is the fridge bugged or something cuz I swear it doesnt help at ALL. I’d be more mad about the fact if it didn’t look so nice in my kitchen.
---
just blew my mind, I totally thought this was possible already. I do believe we can get carved ones now tho lol
---
If you really think about it, I guess it would make sense that the sight is invisible too
---
Problem with mega farm is budget won't let you. And all that stuff is readily available. You just have to learn where good supplies of each item are at.
---
Wow
---
The one in the first image, I’m not sure.
---
The one in the second image is the Raider Scabber outfit from the atom store.
---
weird flex
---
Thanks for showing me that, I can see he's against it 😂
---
It might be, but for 6 months straight and roughly 500+ SBQ fight she has not bugged out even once for me as long as people stay out in the open and thus avoid places the AI can't get pathing to.
---
It just works.
---
Eso has it why not...
---
You dont have to spam stims either.
---
U get me
---
It's like they wanted to get their hands dirty and finally got the guts.
---
You're coated, not invisible. If you can see your weapon transparent, like glass, or water, that means a dot of light should be able to appear on the surface that is already transparent. If you want a proof, turn on your pip boy light while using cham/stealthboy and see if the light is invisible.
---
Pistols solely because pipe revolvers benefit from both Rifleman and Gunslinger perks when modded with a rifle stock. My pipe revolver does about 10 damage less than my hardened lever action, and it uses alot less AP for vats builds.
---
Hehe I know people like thier guns. I have a bloodied sniper. The lever is outclassed imo the handmade and the sniper rifle is also one shot. Trying to point out no point in the lever really. You take another shot, no recoil on the handmade either.
---
You still on, where are you?
---
I have been selling ammo all for a cap. Fusion cores, .50 cal, if it ended up in ammo, it was sold for a cap. It's rare finding players like that but I do it because I run melee builds. It's not common, but there are some of us who does that.
---
Just saying you can’t have your cake and eat it too, being completely invisible should in my opinion atleast have some drawbacks
---
Where'd you get that pose? Im only a level 30 so i'm still learning.
---
Mappalachia...
---
So we need to use ESOs trading system?
---
Yeah, they're pretty much going to capitalize on that fact. Probably why they took Survival mode away, to force shitty workshop interactions right before they introduce paid private servers smh
---
never had any problems with it
---
Limited Time Atom Shop a little back; it may make its return though, only time will tell.
---
run through harpers ferry, you can usually get a decent amount of them if its scorched. same with big bend tunnel
---
replied to wrong dude, sorry lol
---
whats that?
---
FUCK.
---
            Thank you
---
&gt;run through harpers ferry, you can usually get a decent amount of them if its scorched. same with big bend tunnel
---
I play bloodied sniper too, but an IE Lever is worth three BE Levers.  It’s a REALLY rare/special gun.  And this is coming from a guy not even using his IE Lever at the moment. 
---
And I agree the BE Handmade is great (so is the Fixer). Pretty much every gun is good when bloodied...I have them all, pretty much.  
---
PS: Sell me any IE Lever you find.  I’ll overpay because I’m crazy! 🤪
---
A couple of weeks ago I was fighting the Queen in a badly laid drop. Bloodied, had to stay right outside the rad circle. See, when I panic hop, I tend to smack the button for my fucking Pipboy mid-jump. Well, I did. My game lagged. I accidentally slid across too many buttons. 
---
Queen dead, go back to my camp. Tidy things up, dump flux in my stash. Wait...Where is my TSE handmade? This was before I knew to favorite weapons. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I had dropped it some time during the SBQ. I went back down to the bog and hunted for over an hour. Not one bag. It was awful. I hope some low level player found it and was absolutely over the moon. ...And now I favorite all my good weapons lol.
---
Honestly, it’s frustrating
---
Not really honestly kinda regret buying it. The stuff they did add dosent fell substantial and alot if the stuff players ask for like refrigerators were put behind a pay wall. Everything they add just seems like another basic dungeon that your gonna have to run through 100 times b4 u get even close to what u want. It might and this is a huge might be worth playing when npcs drop.
---
No, I was just giving an example of a good in game trading system.
---
Oh i might have heard about npcs but a loooong time ago. It's still not in the game?
---
I mean......all you to do was find a friend who could hold it himself while you went and switched characters. I would NEVER think of just leaving my stuff out in the open for anyone to take, especially knowing how much the game tends to crash.
---
This one was on you.
---
Yeah I use big bend for steel on my other character so will deffo hit up there thanks!:)
---
Or just hold it.
---
Good to know. I've been looking for an upgrade for my Resistant Harness since practically Beta. Never seen Shielded (or the one below it) drop from anywhere.
---
Guess I'll start doing Mire dailies.
---
vendors, vault 94, more events 
---
it is a lot more alive since launch and with npcs coming in 2020 it'll be even more alive
---
What should we do then?
---
I just want shotguns to work again.

Boxes you could drag items to would do it. Could trade multiple items too, each side puts up what they want and both have to confirm for the trade to happen. I could see another dupe with all that though. I remember in runescape, each item was simply a number. Some jackass had the idea he'd change the number and there was no server side check, so a sword turned into a phat in the trade.
---
I have a quad DB for crippling, I only use the enforcer perk. I can clear whitespring golf club, no dramas.
---
I does that. Sometimes I just lay them in front of my vendor because I collected too much and they arent selling fast enough lol
---
Try that thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia\_my\_project\_which\_can\_automatically/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/)
---
The sad part is I've had that happen with a problem before. They never replied.
---
The two of you fucking rock. Never change \m/
---
I did not know that. Thank you for this information.
---
So what about 3rd person crosshair? I mean where're drowbacks when you swap to 3rd person and gain bigger fov, ability to see around fences/walls without exposing yourself and the ability to use accurate aiming that is independent from your character status?
---
The ability to aim in 3rd person should hint the players that the character is able to aim. Lile i said to many, when you can full auto vats in the heads, how rendering the little dot supposed to be rendered would unbalance things?
---
What was the point of the creation of stealthboys lorewise if the users weren't able to see what there're doing?
---
Blue tape too pls
---
It's the stalker outfit from the Atomic Shop
---
Seems like you do not want to work for a game company and get locked into a room until your done making a game or dlc
---
Thanks for the update, that's sad :(
---
Yes, I did this on my mule. I think for guns it mostly gives you pipe weapons, hunting rifle, 10mm and 44. I dont recall getting much different stuff than that, but its been a few months
---
I did that  in 3
---
the new dlc was delayed to the beginning of next year
---
What's the big rare drop on this daily? I've been doing it for months and only getting crap rewards... I'm assuming there's a minuscule change of getting something rare?
---
I remember that system in RuneScape. I have it in my phone now. It seems nowadays that an idea could go both ways as good or bad. I feel the game could use something new to make it easier for everyone but at the same time something that some players won't get irritated and say it's a quality of life thing and stating that we could just do it ourselves.
---
Wow really dame
---
Exactly why you pop buffout and put on power armor
---
Not my idea by any means.  Somebody did it to me and i thought it was hilarious.
---
So your saying since you have a third person reticule you don’t need the red dot light lol. Just use third person and that’s no longer a problem thanks for proving my point
---
I’ve had plenty of people add me to a team to tell me they are doing it to make me an anchor. They usually toss me a little something for doing it. Just find someone with a mic, be honest, and let them know when you are done.
---
Shouldn't fridges be available to obtain through some rare plans? Besides, they only increase food spoiling time by 50%, it's not a big deal. "Good with Salt" can increase percentage up to 90% at cost of \~three more level ups and 3 Luck.
---
My scaventron doesn't work, can't say anything about his usefulness.
---
It’s a special syringer you can get in a daily quest that can make animals able to speak English when shot
---
A stickied thread is the worst solution to any question being asked "... now?" since the thread wouldn't be updated frequently.
---
And there are not necessarily fewer bugs "now" than there were "then" for every person that would ask since Bethesda keeps adding more that they do not resolve before the next update patch of bugs. If anything, it's roughly the same game with different bugs.
---
***HAIL THE CLEAVER TREE***
---
also, where's your camp?
---
My guess would be 10am Eastern US time or 14:00 GMT.
---
I'm saying since the 3rd person aim is viable, there's no logical point to prevent 1st person gameplay. I never said we don't need red dot. You assume things and you're more here to "prove a point" than discuss if it's a good thing or not to show the dot on 1st person.
---
Your point is since you're invisible you should have some drawback, that prevent from aiming from what we're here to discuss. But you change your point to "3rd person is okay". Careful weathercock, the wind is changing again.
---
If they are going to be adding gold panning, you're telling me the player won't randomly catch little guppies, worms or frogs?
---
Seriously? Paid for this shitty game and now have one of my three mates needs to buy a fucking server to avoid all the lag of the horribly exploited and destroyed normal servers, which wont happen, cause we are poor as shit. That and I don't have ridiculous upload speeds that Bethesda thinks I should have for their own servers or game, let alone when it deleted itself 40 gigs through on release date. That was just, the absolute best. Thanks Bethesda, never had a more shitty gaming experience since... well, never... So awesome!   
---
Forgot I haven't seen a price tag anywhere, no one know how much it's supposed to be? Won't still be happening either way but I'd love to know how much it costs for a half enjoyable experience.
---
By god.... *takes of sunglasses*
---
Community on PC is pretty great. 
---
No idea personally, but you might put "RP" into the search bar up there, I know I've seen a few posts from people looking for other RPers.
---
Mules don't have thumbs. I don't see them playing fallout 76.
---
So because you brought up third person I can’t talk about it makes total sense
---
Yeah it's sad tbh
---
Try equipping combat armor skins. Same shit. They don’t work
---
They can’t do anything about bugs but they work quick whenever the atom shop has a problem 
---
Jokes aside they actually immediately solve refund problems though I wouldn’t expect customer support to know anything about fixing bugs
---
Will give caps if anyone finds one and invites me on XB1
---
I remember hauling my first mininuke around for a long time just to be disappointed with how weak it is.
---
And don't forget your Green thumb perk. Its awesome with Tarberry, Snaptail and all alcoholic beverage making requirements.
---
Are you on PS4? I think I have an extra urban mask.
---
It makes perfect sense,  considering you are supposed to be registered already. It should at least tell you that the silo was supposed to kill the person who launched the nuke because of x y z lore therefore requiring a new identity of some sort.
---
Was a Con pack of some sort. 12-19.00$ I think. Others had the Battle coat, revolutionary general uniform.
---
Invest on rifleman ir commando. Really simple. Commando Is better since these weapons can really go fast.
---
It was a bonus item for purchasing a certain amount of Atoms. I loved that part of Fallout 3 so I scooped it up. Might make a return for Halloween but it was there really recent
---
My wife just watched me spend hours on a camp. It is close to what I want... but hours...
---
1. Xbox community isn't too different ps4 so going to suggest it's good. It's a big world, not so much if you go to white springs, top of the world and anywhere near vault 76. People generally stick to themselves.
---
2. It's fairly common to find people in character. I'm a raider character. So I have to initiate pvp, even if I have a lot to lose.
---
Sounds like a possible duper I’d avoid picking them up
---
Oh I have to try that... I’m shooting the scorch beast queen. Do you know what the daily is?
---
Yooo this worked! You're a lifesaver
---
That's how it should be. Make what you want and enjoy it. Plus if you lurk here you can find some tips. I have learned lots in the threads.
---
Second this.
---
No. That’s something that legendary creatures do.
---
It was reward  4 for buying $10 worth of atoms. The first was The Mechanist, then Maxsons outfit then a generals outfit then slasher.  They were up for like a month each. I missed the mechanics, since I had no reason for atoms at the time.
---
Sadly no. Xbox. Thanks though man, youre awesome for offering.
---
Yes it isn’t a bad idea isnt it?
---
Oh ya fogot about the Diseases.
---
This is a frustrating feature since fo4
---
nope move on nothing to see here
---
Bloodied vats crit less vats cost fixer. 
---
Already have a god roll of every other decent gun, and have unstoppable monster and a bloodied swing speed +1 strength power fist. I guess it would be nice to have a bloodied swing speed reduced weight super sledge for nuke zones
---
maybe because this specific weapon cant be modified it also wont show up to be renamed?
---
It would be fun and with potential recipes, there could be added bonuses like +10% melee or extra 10% xp, like some of them already do have.
---
Not damaged so you can't fix it yet, but when you inspected the weapon in your inventory there was a button prompt at the bottom left side of the screen to rename it.
---
You're right, the pip boy light should be coverd as well
---
yea it's unfortunate but let's be real here it's better that they take their time and make it as good as possible
---
I'd be fine with some fisticuffs for the workshop! I'd still lose, but at least I get to see the guy before I die
---
I've eaten opossum irl before, there isn't much I wouldn't eat if I was starving.
---
patch notes are always a good read on lazy days
---
Talk to the people you got your code from?
---
Right now I'm hoping for a double barrel shotgun with max range.  furious, instigating, executioner, ?
---
1 star gives only 1 star items.
---
2 star can give 1 or 2 star items
---
3 star can drop 1,2, or 3 star item.
---
It sucks, but that's the system.
---
Ok ty both you guys are right did not know that
---
Ive contacted support about when playing nuclear winter it auto completed all ym challenged without rewarding me anything, they wouldnt even give me the 70 or so atoms for that just said that nuclear winter challenges had been disabled for the time being clearly not reading what I had written
---
Wes tek or uranium fever will both give a few hundred steel if you use scrapper perk. I've gotten 500 steel from one uranium fever before
---
$10 atoms bundle with a bonus of 500 atoms 3 repair kits 3 scrap kits and the costume. 1000 + 500.
---
What’s to hate about Tea Time? It’s dead easy.
---
And it’s like all of a sudden there’s earth quakes when your looking through the sight
---
Because Bethesda removed literally every other way to roleplay as a raider
---
That's why I'm asking, if this is seen as a drawback of the mutation/item/effect, where does this drawback exist in 3rd person? If there's no drawback, then this isn't a drawback, this is a balance issue. Or simply BGS didn't take account of how a red dot/holo actually works and used it like a simple accessorie that add a floating reticle. Which is also okay because as I said to another guu, nobody wants it right now, OP just pointed that you can't aim in pve while invisible in 1st person because of a missing dot light.
---
But still, I'm interested in answers to the previous questions.
---
&gt; Now toddle on child
---
And you lost.  You can't act like you're right when you're resorting to discrediting others' arguments by calling them children.
---
I would be standing all the time. So with that said would you still pick AA over F?
---
Yes, the shotgun doesn't need to be an extremely close range weapon.  That's what melee is for.  Make it like a rifle but with spread so the real damage fall off is the pellets not hitting, not the pellets turning to sand after several feet.
---
 The sun and moons transform day to night, but what transforms the *mind*?
---
Yeah :x could be fixed with a little tweak on the sightfov but I'm not sure if they can do it individually, I don't think so.
---
Queen of the hunt, I've gotten 2.
---
Well........duping is cheating, so.....
---
XD! I know that pain x)
---
I have done this before aswell. I try to keep everything under 30 caps unless its ammo then it's just 1 cap. I also sell food and water for 0 since I'm so close to the vualt, I wanna give newcomers a head start
---
Yeah, I miss that 400lb stash - it was fun figuring out resource management in Beta
---
Before I left for work today I spotted the plan for the ultracite laser gun (not Gatling) at the BOS Watoga Vendor, server hop there and u will find it quick, then just craft &amp; dismantle over and over to learn the mods lol.
---
Only if I can use grenades
---
But the new fortnite update was just released. Fallout wants to be like fortnite...right?
---
I have around 80k 556 and 9k Bobby pins. I usually close up my shops when I get around 25k caps and start buying stuff. I use Bobby pins to get my caps back from npc vendors when I buy something, but I'm working my way away from that. I've gotten most of the plans now so I just sell them to vendors daily.
---
Bloody. Having unyielding armour will boost your agility up when at low health so your harder to detect so that's another bonus
---
Or free paint or skins so they dont see it...
---
Don't forget 2x with poison resist ...
---
I wouldn't say a tenth. Maybe half. It's a pretty widely used ammo type that is bought regularly.
---
Tastes like chicken
---
I use a piece of scotch tape with a mark on it.
---
&gt;50 cal rounds instead 50 cal rounds
---
And you think you're any better with your asinine attempts to discredit my feelings on a situation just because you weren't there. Shows a lot about your character if you view my concerns of someone's well being as a character flaw. The only person here that lost is you in this scenario. If you're going to continue to ask stupid questions and make stupid assumptions like a child, I will point that fact out. If you don't like it, maybe you should have told a story, which is what I asked for in the first place, and not an opinion piece. It seems following instructions isn't your strong suit little one. You'll learn in time though. Hopefully.
---
That would be awesome! And be even better if there was different dialogs as well 
---
One of chally being nice, mean, having a dig a Grahm, yourself be great
---
Had flatwoods monster at my camp yesterday and then mothman today. Also got my first perfectly preserved pie the other day too. First try on the machine!
---
The AA will negate more of her armour than Furious would.
---
let me grab that paint off your hands then i can use it lol
---
Just to comment on the duper concern: I was able to catch these spawning in on video:
---
[https://youtu.be/q1k1S0nt1OU](https://youtu.be/q1k1S0nt1OU)
---
Dont know why this gets downvoted? It is a deliberate marketing tactic targeting us. It's the same with limited time %off sales of which I even fall prey to. I like a good deal.
---
Totally Agreee!!!!! ive missed so much :( my favourite part of this game is camp building.. I die a little bit inside each time i see all the different floors and statues and decorations ive missed :( i really want the greenhouse too.. One day i hope they bring it all back.. i'll be buying EVERYTHING!!
---
Plasma grenade/mine, heavy raider arm/leg/torso, healing salve mire and cranberry bog.
---
Thanks!
---
&gt;one-shotting me with his TSE Handmade.
---
So, he two-shot you.
---
Never forget the words of our gaming God Miyamoto: "A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad."
---
So I agree, it's an obnoxious question because we already know the answer.
---
From what I understand with AA and Stabilized it would be 77.25% but with F it would be 45% Stabilized and 45% extra damage. So would the extra 22.25% be better then the 45% extra damage?
---
That's a solid point of view.  It sounds like your bloodied build is close to what I tried and for the most part I agree.  I usually felt pretty confident I wasn't going to die in a fight even when I was discovered, but my main gripe is the stupid rads.  They constantly had me in fear of dying.  Not even in fights necessarily, just accidentally wandering into radiation had me watching what little health I had get zapped away.  When I combined that with the fact that the build I came from generally seemed on par for nearly everything combat-wise, I didn't see the benefits to my personal play style / preferences.
---
From what I can tell, the armor pen mags dont even work. Definitely doesnt work for my as handmades.  I tested them with multiple mags 
---
and NONE of the mags made a single damage number difference on, ghouls, deathclaws, sentry bots, assault bots, protections, scorched beasts, super mutants, or players.
---
Be a great idea I think 
---
Different area’s different fish so different meat to cook 
---
Or could even do a warcraft thing where you fish up random items which is basically scrap but there’s tare items in the water.
---
you are right
---
As a lvl 300+ player, the last thing I’d want is to be mistaken for a walking vending machine.  I wouldn’t want every lvl 50 player bothering me and interrupting my menus with trade offers.
---
We have vending machines at our homes. We have the option to refuse trade offers. Do we really need to mark items for sale on our character?
---
I can already see this idea encouraging freeloaders to check players like they would vending machines and getting butthurt when someone carries only what they need and doesn’t want to give away their extra legendaries or a handful of stimpaks.
---
You missed it huh? The general should be escorted by missileer at all times. It would be considered a hostile act otherwise.
---
It's in the fourth part of the training in the little pentagon room at the bunker.
---
 Twitch drops would be amazing. It would definitely increase viewership and reinvigorate the community.
---
&gt;Havent played since launch
---
Ok, congrats
---
Don't mess with Fallout 76 raiders, they'll kill you over stuffs they don't even need 😎
---
No shit, if you ever take over a workshop when you're under level 100, you are like a lamp to the moth. If you're +200, no one will bother you even if you take over all three power plants in a single session.
---
He's trolling you Kb. Lol
---
Did you read the rest i want to start playing again figured this would be the place to ask
---
Lol you deleted your comments? Well isn't that special
---
How about spending 30 minutes to try it out by yourself?
---
Dont understand the toxicity for a simple question im not trying to be rude in anyway
---
It happens, when people see the same question over and over again for a billion times
---
No, I was making progress. Oh wells, It worked this time - Just not for the deathclaw thing. Damn stealth build limitations.. I think I have to get detected.
---
Yeah that isnt a bad idea and we could get low level weapons to be able to either scrap or to give to low level players
---
Bloodied, it's a myth that you die easily. It's cool.
---
I have a furious ffr 50 cal max heavy gunner perk cards loadout on one of my lvl 3xx characters. Uses 4k ammo per scorched earth and i thought it was badass until i lvl up my other bloodied build lvl 1xx character, it is my favourite character now.
---
It's a vats crit sneak bloodied lever gun rifleman commando build. I use an instigating zealots 50 cal in excavator pa sometimes. It's cool. Hold the trigger button and tap crit often. Squat up on the fence stay away from scorched earth mobs.
---
I have a genuine intrest in the game im not trying to attack the people who already like it i thought i made that clear i guess not
---
I'll have to try this. Thanks.
---
I mean it's the fastest way to lighten camp stash. I stock up on fusion cores and sell them pretty cheap along with the 1 cap ammo deal. I sell my 38 and 10 mm for 0 along with syringer. I mean if I ain't using them im not raping your cap stash for them.
---
I wasn't thinking. I live in California. We have Mountain Lions and Bears. Oh my.
---
Wtf are you talking about i am on reddit to see whats new and dont post something everyday
---
Had no clue that was a thing, thanks
---
This post is quite useful:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
I just want the scout armors to get some nice skins.
---
I just got a BE+1A Lever Action Rifle from the Purveyor. Thought about making a B build. You use PA all the time or regular armor?
---
I’d rather eat people but if I was starving probably
---
What’s the point? On a private server, it would just be you and your friends. Who’s going to come to your town?
---
Yes! Let me plant firecracker berries, strangler pods, and glowing fungus at my camp!
---
Welcome to PC! my tag is LadyGoggles, feel free to shoot me a friend request. I'm not on everyday, but when I am it's usually around 6-7pm Eastern. Hope to catch you in-game soon!
---
Is this a chance for me to flex that I got a BFFR fixer, IE lever action &amp; TSE Railway?😏
---
"Does this game have 16 times the detail yet?"
---
Thank you for this i didnt mean for this post to be disrespectful in anyway
---
I use strangler heart PA and the acid damage on it is only 4 damage per second in PvP, I wouldn't call that broken.
---
Lol deleting comments now? You obviously are a shady pos if you have to delete your comments and posts. Go scam elsewhere
---
If you FT to Lucky Hole Mine, go south about 100 yards/meters. There’s a very small pond along the base of the cliffs...
---
Fun fact: the other item that randomly spawns in my camp is Viable Scorchbeast DNA.
---
No problem, hope you get one soon!
---
Lucky you.
---
I got a explosive 50. Cal
---
It was actually last months pack and they reverted to calling that one the summer pack. They had back to back $10 passes until these few weeks of zero new content
---
I just returned back there to have a look (thank you, I forgot I said I was going to do this) and it was not there. Instead I found a Light Machine Gun. The Gatling Plasma was in a meat bag, so it could be relevant to your Luck points. It has spawned a heavy weapon 2/2 times so far
---
sure, but you need to pay for that
---
Only the barrel matters for that. Auto barrels for commando (or guerilla if pistol grip), any other for rifleman (or gunslinger with a grip).
---
Halfway between Summersville and Whitespring
---
 I want a "pissing in the fissure" pose.
---
I barely wear excavator pa. Only for gathering lead from lucky hole mine.
---
Exactly, I was doing the same until someone nerfed my camp because I was catering solely to low level players. Like I had legendary weapons for levels 5-15 for like five caps each, legendary and fully modded armor at around the same level and price, all repaired, no junk other than bulks of screws and springs for cheap, but because I didn't have any 3 star level 50 legendaries he decided to destroy my entire camp. I didn't even have time to put junk in my stash so I could fast travel and move my camp. He was like level 160 something and I'm a little over half that level. I have since stopped vending entirely and moved my camp away from the forest.
---
I spent $15 on Amazon with a free $15 Amazon gift card for Twitch Prime members and still felt like it was too much for this game. It just feels so unpolished in every area compared to current games.
---
I have played since launch ... you have a question?
---
^^^
---
I’ll take that as a yes then ☺️
---
How has the game improved bug and connection wise and why does everybody seem to hate new players because i have a genuine interest in the game but it was hard to play i didnt really get to experience as much as i wanted to
---
They do
---
Or the regular tuxedo, maybe a wolf tuxedo for the wolf fedora would be nice
---
Yeah, people sell that plan for like 20k caps Ive seen, If youre into the game and like assault rifles Id say learn it yourself
---
If no there are plenty of people willing to buy
---
I got a 3 star mutant's gatling laser, does extra damage percentage if I am mutated, and I am mutated without rads because of a legendary chest piece I have on that cures rads during daylight hours. When I get back into it after my sprain heals I'm going to try and get another mutation if it's possible to have more than one
---
I spent over 17,000+ script all on weapons and didn't get a keeper in the bunch.  I got plenty of weapons that others would find desirable, but it was very discouraging.
---
Damnit wrong thread
---
Gross. I at least look for higher leveled people in excavator PA. 
---
300lbs in a workshop is ASKING for it.
---
The personal terminal will tell you where the tourist is on your server, I believe it's under either Appliances or Misc. Structures. You'll need to unlock it in the Atom Shop if you haven't already, but it's free.
---
I got a rock... 👻
---
I got a bag of spoiled vegies once and was so confused as I've seen it being used as a "your shop is shit" message. Lol so like I get so confused when that happens like now when I have a visitor I just ask them to talk to me if they need something or if they think something is overpriced. A bad review is a bad review. I dont want a prospective customer to be swayed by the bag of shit left in there...
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
The plan isn't rare it's just in high demand
---
For me it runs very well indeed. I have a good connection and I built this machine to play games.
---
 Go play the fucking game to find out how it is!
---
Same here dude
---
shotguns are really good withcrit builds where you use 4 leaf clover and ignore all other forms of crit gain. if all your pellets land pretty much every other shot is a crit. this makes them pretty much the only weapon good with medics prefix and can stack crit damage with something like junkies or bloodied build. pistols are cool cause you hold them in one hand while wearing power armor and they use very low ap in vats.
---
I've left spoiled food but only because it was taking up inventory space, so when I do drop spoiled food I drop a couple canned items and a water or two so it doesn't look like I'm giving a one star rating on their contents. If someone doesn't have what I'm looking for I just keep searching, no resentment from me lol
---
 No body cares, go play or don't. why pick on us?
---
This is awesome dude!
---
So I bought the game before launch and Play every Day. It's possible to have 5 characters on one account, so I have 5 at level 150+
---
I'm still bored so I start deleting characters to try new builds and IT bothers you that I transfer some junk and meds?
---
To that I say.. you suck. I mean, you are really bad at games if this is an issue lol..
---
neither will ever be as good as rifle or heavy guns unfortunately but you can do 99% of content just fine with a nicely rolled legendary.
---
I ment no disrespect but ive been faced with constant toxicity sorry i had interest in your game guess ill pass
---
I wasnt picking i was wondering im sorry
---
i am ign crackbeard
---
i have the rifle/pistol
---
Yeah. 1 cap for all ammo except .38 and .44 which i usually put at zero caps. Its usually a high lvl that takes the free stuff but occasionally it gets into the right hands. I try to pay attention to when someone buys like 38 shotgun shells. Its usually a low lvl spending all they can and are hard up. So ill pull the rest out if the machine and give it to them. I would rather be a nice guy that gets played sometimes than a jackass anyday. Stay classy folks.
---
Stories like this are why I always hire couriers from trading communities. It'll run you about 1 grand and there's usually a glitch with server crashes or the UI not loading correctly to work around, but it's worth it.
---
The plan is rare.  It has a low chance to drop from the event and also, because the event is nearly impossible without a proper team, it is rare in the fact that not too many people complete the Encryptid event successfully or even take the time to try doing it at all.
---
"RoLePlAy aS a RaIDeR!" You guys crack me up.
---
I whole heartedly agree.
---
This is why we use Excavator PA with the extra carry weight mod for the chest. If you log out and then log on again you also get another +100 lbs of carry weight too. You can still move as normal (but with some AP drain) even with 1000 lbs of loot. Then you can find a world container with no weight limit to do the transfer, hoping the server doesn't crash before you come back with your mule character ;)
---
If you're on PC you can run 2-3 instances of Fo76 on the same machine (just change the graphics setting to low if needed) after buying some cheap copies of the game. This is what I do now as I lost some good weapons/armor before, when I got disconnected or my anchor server hopped.
---
I started the event without knowing what it really was and a group of 8+ people all over level 200 showed up. Although I died a lot still, I had a blast.
---
so doing it that way, do you avoid the 10% loss of caps?
---
Okay, good for you. And according to your "research", Bethesda isn't trying to become a publicly traded company?
---
Yeah NW is beta, so that makes kind of sense
---
There's a container at the back of his pod you need to collect the junk from.
---
I I got one decent armor piece. And then everything else was trash.  The only good Legendaries that I got this weekend we’re from queen fights and player vendors
---
 Wondering whether we can tell you if you will like the game? We can't!
---
Yes.
---
I want them to add a NCR veteran outfit or at least the helmet
---
Wow, I only did around 3,000 scrip and with the same results as you, nothing I’ll use but a few items others will want. But 17k, holy smokes. ‘Very discouraging’ seems a wild understatement of what that experience must have been like.
---
I asked what changed/improved and gave you questions not if id enjoy the game
---
Your improvising skill is... man !
---
 Are you on PC? I can help people there. PenGun in game.
---
Bloodied explosive handmade, pretty good
---
Got it. Thanks
---
Thats why I dont wear chameleon armour. If you play high agility stealth build chameleon is useless after a certain point. Especially combined with 3* sneak.
---
I got a furious explosive handmade from 190 script lol
---
How much do they go for ?
---
Pretty sure it will be fixed come Wednesday
---
This is a known problem that's been around for a good while and is a separate issue from quests not always saving progress when you'd think they would. Some quests seem to be more susceptible than others. I've had this with the last Free States quest (Coming to Fruition) over the weekend, and some of Rose's quests (Flavors of Mayhem and Key to the Past) also tend to vanish and re-appear randomly on log-in.
---
The only known fix is to keep server hopping/trying to log in until you get those quests back.
---
Gatling gun, .50 cal guns, Light Machine Gun. All have SHITTY first person accuracy. Zoom out to 3rd person and the shot gun effect turns into a sniper gun effect. It's crazy.
---
Your faith in Bethesda is touching
---
No. Just trash. I spent 3500.
---
Nothing that I'll use, but a bunch that I've sold and a couple that I stashed away as I know they are worth a good bit.  2 star assassin's explosive handmade, 3 star bloodied fixer, executioners power attack sheepsquatch staff, 3 star Junkies ffr 50 cal.  
---
Not bad overall, but nothing game changing and I'm set for scrip for a few days.
---
No, it was a one-shot because the second bullet missed. ;-)
---
They occasionally bring things back into the shop actually
---
Imo, and I'm level 27X, I've noticed more success with AA over Furious. I haven't played since Nuclear Winter dropped though so it is quite possible my experience is out of date.
---
It's not that rare when you do the event and succeed, but the failure rate on the event seems rather high.
---
Whats the primary legendary effect?
---
I only ever tried the Cranberry Relish as well. Nothing else is really worth keeping a storage of, lol
---
There is a water basin and nice flat space left of mysteries mansion. If you place your camp while facing the mansion across the "Lake" you Will face that way on fast travel 😎
---
Also close enough to whitespring for quests and trading.
---
Yeah but it stacks so if you use something like an explosive laser or gatling plasma with a splitter mod it becomes even more instakill than it was without the acid damage
---
QE combat shotgun and Junkies SS pole hook
---
I just hope the bring stuff back before I lose interest again. Lots of good games on the horizon.
---
Yes, player to player trades are not taxed. Any day now they’ll fix the trade glitch.
---
Lol, you’re obsessed. Find something else to do cus you’re lookin just as nuts 😂
---
But they're not in bags
---
If you kill someone in one Hot with a shotgun are you also a smart ass and say you 8 shotted him... One Pull of trigger=oneshot even if it Would fire 25 bullets
---
That's a myth. I use a BE gatling plasma and a VE gatling plasma with beam splittere and I've tested it with friends. Many of my friends can take over a hundred shots and the acid damage doesn't increase with every shot.
---
I usually just use roads if I want a flat area.
---
Yeah, this has worked for me, too.
---
Roleplay as a Virgin Sounds better
---
The answer is no anyways
---
Wish I’d know about this weeks ago
---
I lost interest with the purveyor sale. It really made all the negatives of the game stand out like small bank space and the 3 3* weapon per day scrip limit. 
---
They haven't added anything worthwhile since release. Maybe what? 3 hours of new content so far since it came out a year ago? Just because you have to replay it 100 times to get a half decent reward doesnt mean its 100 hours of content. The game is basically still in beta so I'll return when they actually make a finished product
---
JE90 Guassrifle
---
Maybe it was patched? I've seen videos of it working in the past. I dont have strangler heart armour so idk if they were legit or whatever
---
I was so happy when someone told me to try it like a month ago.
---
Seriously, just *stop*. You’re trying to be overly intellectual and morally right but your obsession with this thread has gone way way beyond the point of normal behavior. I was reviewing my posts; you’re rereading and responding to comments like your life depends upon it. Calm your shit and be cool, honey bunny.
---
B often has said ‘through’ a given date when they should say ‘until’ that date. It will probably end tomorrow morning Bethesda (Eastern) time.
---
By rapid I'm guessing you mean faster fire rate. Both of your examples have 2 Prefixes and 1 Major effect so I'm guessing your talking about build your own legendary with no restrictions and not following what we currently have...[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects) In that case...
---
Vampire + Furious + Fire Rate Ultracite Gatling Laser
---
Vampire + Furious + Quad Light Machine Gun
---
Vampire + 2 Shot + Quad Tesla Rifle
---
I'm sure I could come up with some others that were varying levels of both fun and OP as crap at the same time.
---
Because killing players is funner than grinding screws
---
I got a 3\* Bloody Pipe Revolver.
---
I got a casual shielded plan from Queen of the Hunt.
---
Where were you when I needed you? 🤪
---
In two words:  yes.
---
1: I'd love that but don't see it changing. 
---
2: It's probably lag.
---
It stioo freezes the game at the queen for sure
---
Spent 1500 and got literal steaming shit that I can only turn back to script 3 guns a day because they would rather punish us than let us just have a chance at decent rolls faster. Made me decide to uninstall
---
Not what i meant
---
Probably lagged out lulz. 
---
There should be a sticky about common bugs and if they have solutions like this.
---
"F" NO
---
It could be any type of fishing with rod gun bow explosives etc
---
And it could be something under the challenges menu to earn atoms as well
---
Why would they do that do like bruh
---
The best flat ground I know is on roads or under electrical pylons. I use a great one west of the most northern train station in the great divide.
---
I'm going to fix this for you.  With some painters tape right on your monitor.
---
I can see that happening :)
---
Hell i'm trying to get the fixer plan. I'm burning through caps fast traveling trying to find someone selling the plan
---
The battle coat was the very first tho. From around february-march this year, I think
---
Same 2700 here and best was a BFFR lever action which is kinda lame, FFR on sniper guns seems useless
---
I like your faith.
---
It may be blind faith but its faith nontheless
---
It's annoying but I'm with you on the practice part. I have no issues anymore.  Useful skill in any game too. You only get the quick reflexes when you dissociate and live the game, as weird as that might sound.
---
I'd rather have ffr on a lever than on a bolt action, but yeah it is still kinda useless unless it was quad imo. The pipe gun is good if it's a revolver as supposedly you can still double dip pistol and rifle perks for higher damage
---
1 perception.  Yeah, it was on the high side, but I was trying to dump caps and I didn't have one.  Seemed fair to me.  I use an IE lever and it'll give me some options.  Gotta grab the stuff you want when the opportunity arises.
---
Class freak also helps with carry weight
---
Dude, get off your high horse.  This happened in a videogame.  You're taking it too seriously and acting like some guy came up to you on the street and was making tangible threats.  Any threats you're saying happened happened over a videogame.  It shouldn't be taken seriously.  Now stop saying shit like following instructions isn't my strong suit or I'll learn in time like I'm a child.  That's just pathetic.  Again, get off your high horse.
---
&gt;I wouldn’t hold back on the fridges either if each purchase wasnt actually the whole fridge unlock at $7 each time.
---
Please don't say this.  Please don't do this.  No one should be paying $7 for a fridge in a videogame.  No on should have to pay $7 for a fridge in a videogame.  Too many things in the atom store are overpriced if you were to buy atoms with money and so many people don't have a problem with that because you can get atoms in game.  That doesn't change that $7 for a fridge is too much and no one should be paying for atoms to get that.
---
wow man you must be loved in parties huh
---
It's a perk called Frog Legs.
---
No thanks. ESO stream chat on twitch is full of people endlessly asking "DROPS!? are drops on!? DROPS PLS" and it's incredibly annoying in my opinion. 
---
I'd rather get rewards from doing community events, not from watching particular streamers.
---
Really? So I can it with the perk system. Thanks.
---
You said it yourself.  Slower Rifle weapons are pointless. FFR rules.
---
You misunderstand, I agree $7 is far too much for a fridge. It’s likely that it’s so expensive because the item is for sale instead of just a skin
---
Losing junk is literally the only consequence to death in this game. They should definitrly not make it easier.
---
In Nuclear Winter yes. Or you can save up your overseer tickets from duplicate cards that you get in perk packs in NW to buy it.
---
&gt;Sturdy frame seems to do nothing from tests too. I tried multiple shadowed armors, muffled seems obsolete by ultralight and escape artist imo.
---
In what context? It absolutly reduces weight of armour carried. Or are you sayin that the reduced weight gained from Sturdy Frame has no effect on stealth?
---
Put points into intelligente 🙂
---
I always bring a shovel in my inventory because of that quest. The 6 points of carry weight wasted are well worth shutting him up.
---
Bethesda said they were aware of the issue and will be patching it in future.
---
It is possible to do 47K damage to the SBQ through her 70% Damage reduction. That I have seen killed her at 60-70% health (Discounting arguments that she has 32k non-scalling health to start)
---
So it is entirely possible to 3 shot her, and in theory even 1-shot her.
---
A level 30 All Rise at level 35 was easy enough.. don't overthink it 😁
---
This ducks over my entire stealth build
---
Man it’s almost as if you,your guns and everything attached to them are invisible
---
That is a lot of dedication and love you put into this. Really really stunning work. I just wish I could see it in person but I'm playing on PC. :-(
---
This is so true for a glass rifle at long range. 3rd person is easily superior to vats with Gauss rifle
---
3* and 3 2* armor and then you still have change. Be dramatic, bye Felicia!
---
I mean, the gun isn't visible so... 10/10 realism?
---
If you get close to it, you still get the option to make friends even if it has no idea you’re there.
---
and is that my fault that they are too lazy to do work. BGS what the most profit with no work or little work as possible, and we can see it on the shop. its not even a year and how many times have they used the same assest on the Shop or assets from other games. 
---
what I dont agree with is them forcing me to buy new mechanics after I paid 60 bucks for the game. I dont care about cosmetic microtransaction, P2W no matter in what form or farctor are not OK its a fucking cancer in the game industry. 
---
also I wouldnt mind supporting them if you know, they fix the game on a timely manner and would bring new content for end game players more often. 
---
by you defending them you are part off the problem and not the solution.
---
Use an officially courier, just type “courier!” on a Reddit post and someone official will help move your stuff for you for a small fee. It’s better than losing it all when the server crashes or someone finds it man I’ve been there and done that
---
Same for me but there is a line if the microtransactions become as bad as Ubisoft in there single player games I might not be able to distinguish what is the game and what is dlc
---
While we are on the topic of aiming, please fix the minigun bug that causes the gun to not fire if you aim after starting the spool up.
---
Bethesda: good idea! *slaps a 1000 Atom cost* there you go!
---
NCR didn't exist during this time though I get what your going ignoring the Pint-Sized Slasher outfit...
---
Yeah I'm super overweight... I'm giving away legendaries
---
I got a bloody/vats crit Fixer on Thursday. It’s pretty absurd. I guess B/E might be a little better for PvE, but the crit boost and combat rifle vats efficiency absolutely smokes players in PvP. I’m more than happy with it.
---
It’s simple really: JUST ADD EVERYTHING (non-magical fantasy-esque) FROM SKYRIM INTO THE GAME. 
---
You already have the coding, the sprites, and the designs. Just DO it. Instant improvement.
---
I've done at least 200 Improved Repair Kit worth of SBQ and did not get this glitch for months now. So either the nuke placement I mentioned prevented it or simply staying outside the V9 fence area all the time which leads to the SBQ aggroing to me or others staying outside 90% of the time.
---
Lol, I did get where I am all on my own. It's called adulthood. Try it yourself dome time
---
Good on you then.
---
That's a pretty good idea. It would be a great currency dump, which the game does need.
---
So you basically want a Fallout: Wasteland Sims Edition video game instead. Lol it seems like you guys are never gonna stop until “Bethesda makes it” so that your character never dies and farms unbothered as if it weren’t set in the Wasteland. Oh well.
---
I only have a 1060 and get massive framerate drops at people's camps who have many lights; lamps, christmas lights, etc. Is your camp lit up like that?
---
Only if I can just pounce on them and yeet them out of the water with my bare hands
---
I just ask someone to hold them for me if that's any help at all
---
Yeah that could work and only accessible when you call it down be good for both extra storage and swapping items between characters as many people use multiple characters for different builds
---
Same here, I'm having the same issue with my 980ti 6GB vram. That's why camp budget exist coz too much objects on screen with no optimization create this beheviour.  For example, one complex camp placed in a complex area (like whitespring) make the frame drops to 50, two near camps kill the frame to 30 or so...
---
Thanks! I just miss having my robots from fo4 so this would be a fun way to have so cool npc help.
---
Me to man, i just get use to it. Not a big deal just have to aim good
---
Serious non trolling question since vie taken a break from the game until recently...is the regular crafted version of the fixer even that good? Worth the effort to get?
---
Wouldn't a legendary fixer up to 3 stars with better perks be what people would want?
---
Love it. I love playing solo. Joined clans I never play with. I need this.
---
Yes, my initial 1000 scrip yielded an F10 50 Cal and a FE Minigun. Two days later while spending 150 scrip, I finally got a Troubleshooter's FFR Gatling Gun - it cranks like mad and makes short work of Silo/AWOL robots. The rest were either the wrong weapon type (Troubleshooter's Pistol) or wrong legendary prefix (Nocturnal Minigun). I sold 3 bloodied and 3 explosive weapons (but no BE).
---
I love the concept, but I definitely took advantage of this when I was playing classic MMOs back in the day, and it ruined some flavor of the game. Having a super high level earn the items and then passing them along was a bit, well... cheap in a way. 
---
Although I do think this might be a considerable option to have Plans given to the account and not the character. That somewhat makes sense to me. Still make be cheap. I’d be willing to try it.
---
This is me in racing games, if I'm not in first person I hate it and I play much worse
---
At Level 50... Maybe? At level 30, definitely. I was given it at level 25 and when I reached 30 it was a v good weapon for me
---
AA gives you +28.9% more damage and F gives +45% damage so in the long run, sustained fire on the SBQ's face is better with F. Especially if you prime it. I have an AAFFR and an F10 50 Cal; the former hits 22 dmg over 11/second speed, the latter hits 35-50 dmg over 9/second.
---
Two things. 
---
1.) I would love there to be a Community Design Community where we could upload a picture of a concept and Bethesda could look at it and decide to put that bad boy in-game, rewarding the artist with a plan for it or whatever and
---
 2.) I would love to see a bigger and somewhat modernized variety of items for characters to wear. I’m not saying to remove the 60s aesthetic, but let’s begin to let it evolve. The bombs drop in 2077. That’s 100 years after the aesthetic’s original time period. Just look how much our real world styles and tech have changed since then. (I know about Fallout’s nuclear instead of miniaturized power backstory, but it feels like a game company’s excuse not to make new items nowadays.)
---
Just some thoughts rolling I my head.
---
Whenever I do this I make sure I have a level 1 pipe pistol, level 5 armour and die easy while shouting the same 5 lines of dialogue. If I'm gonna roleplay as a raider I'm gonna make it "true fallout"
---
I always find at least one stealthboy at the raider camp behind top of the world ski resort
---
Assasins but i think i have a stalkers
---
From one of the September ITVs:
---
* We’re currently placing our focus on Wastelanders, but after it launches, we will revisit your feedback and make additional changes to the game to improve PVP in the core Fallout 76 experience in fun new ways.*
---
That’s all we know about the future of PvP atm
---
Yes please!!! I’m in Australia and the queues are so long. I can sit there waiting for half an hour sometimes. I’ve given up on queuing cause the wait is so boring.
---
To be clear, anti-armor effect stack multiplicatively, so AA (50%) and Stabilized (45%) is   72.5% armor ignored. However, armor ignore has diminishing returns on the actual damage dealt so F is actually 22.42% more damage. You can play with this in the [Calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html).
---
I an currently doing a bloodied sneak build. At how much agility would you say that chameleon becomes useless? I have only 2 pieces of armor with unyielding and 21 agility in total.
---
Thank you. Well it wasn't me, but I do that too. I encountered way too many people with ridiculous prices. "Of course let's buy your gamma ammo at 5c each and this three star worthless armor 11200 just to scrip it".
---
Yeah, 5.56 sells like mada. My melee guy I balling and all he does is sell ammo.
---
I dont need armour. Also, you going to disagree with any of my points or just say I'm being dramatic and ignore the problems I brought up?
---
My favorite suggestion on this sub so far. I like the postmaster idea, would be good if you were be able to attack the postmaster and steal the loot. They would be quite rare to see I think, how often do you randomly encounter another player on the map unless you're at someones CAMP or a busy location? You could have different levels of post too, like the real world but adapted to fallout, so like 1st class delivery could be delivered with heavy protection and free postage could be like a level 5 protectron taking your mail. They could charge whatever it would cost in caps to get to the persons CAMP + 30%?
---
I don't think this will happen but it's a neat idea.
---
Nothing good from the purveyor but 2 OK finds from player vendors.
---
A Instigating FFR 50 cal for 1 K caps and a Vampire Fixer RW for 5 K caps. 
---
I am always at full caps so it's basically free guns from vendors.
---
The accuracy hit from two shot makes it a pretty bad effect for a long range sniper rifle. Having your damage start to drop off at mid range is not what most rifleman characters are looking for. Two shot is alright for heavy guns and commando builds, but it’s way down the list behind bloody, junkie and instigating for desirable long gun effects. I’d consider furious and executioners to be better options on a lever gun, if I’m asked to value it. 
---
TSE is still being used in the community as a colloquialism for “strong gun”, so I’m sure it’s possible to find a buyer. You typically don’t see them being listed as “trade only” on the forums anymore and the prices have dropped substantially, especially since the purveyor was added to the game. I wouldn’t expect five figures, but players that don’t have experience with a two shot long gun might overpay if you put it in a vending machine.
---
Like i can drive a car. Give me a little Rc Car and I look like a derp factory creating derps on an unheard of level. Its absurd to me now. My nose goes up to third person. *trots off in a hoitey toitey manner*
---
But for real though, it's something I cant seem to do anymore. My brothers are fascinated by it.
---
Awesome! How are you levitating things?
---
Watch someone light up an end game event with a B/FFR gatling laser and a half decent build, then chime back in. I won’t get into legacy energy weapons, because calling those junk is absurd.
---
SMH.. 1:3* is 40 script so 3 turned in is 120. do you want me to keep plugging numbers? because you were exaggerating I'm your post to give your point (points?) spice or attention? IDGAF  why but kudos to you for why you don't like a game. Just go away and drag the whole train with you. I am not going to say anything about the issues you brought up because you perceive them to be issues and they are not.. frankly they are YOURS . my issue is opinions like yours. After a glass I wine I half heartedly threw in my two cents. I felt compelled to respond to clarify but your post lacked so much substance I don't see a point. see ya starlet sniper.
---
TL DR
---
why are you online if you don't like to read? 
---
get bent.
---
One of my hopes is the ability to queue up at Vault 51. Maybe after it’s out of “Beta”
---
I have a bunch of plans for cheap in my vending machine, I'll be on sometime later today(10/21), PSN is mgs_otacon
---
Stop taking the workshops if you don’t PVP. 
---
I haven’t PVP’ed a single time during my 600 hours in this game because I keep my ass away from workshops. 
---
If we want some kind of player base in this game, we need the game to cater to both PVE and PVP.
---
Added to psn
---
I can do math you fucking twat and before you commented about me being dramatic (lmfao look at your useless dramatic paragraph you just made compared to the few things I was saying to op) no one was even talking to you. Dont like what I'm saying why dont you scroll past like anyone with half a brain cell would do
---
No mention of ultracite targeting HUD? Super rare plan imo
---
I run my stealth build with 20 agility now. I use to have 24 agility with chameleon but wittled it back slowly then dumped the chameleon.
---
I thought the was the reason but I removed all my lights and only gained about 2 fps and it still uses 100% of the GPU. Even changing to all low settings keeps the usage around 80-100%.
---
I can help, what is your IGN?
---
Why would that be good?
---
Mrblurr (PC btw)
---
Yeah it's really bad much worse then fallout 4 settlements. I think it's got to do with the overall render distance being very high in fallout 76.
---
most inconvenient cheat to ever exist
---
Burr no one was talking to me. burrr ba Burr cool story dude. sorry you stuck out at Chili's tonight.
---
So, you were buying 1000 atoms every week since March? And now you are asking Bethesda if they want to milk less money out of you?!?
---
I mean...come on...they are a profit oriented company. As long as you keep throwing money on them, they are thinking that their business model is great. Why should they change and risk that players like you are getting more atoms for free and stop buying atoms? Because...obviously you like to buy things from the shop. And if they give you more atoms for free (or as rewards) you might not buy extra atoms. Also, there is only a limited amount of new items they can put into the shop. Increasing the amounts of atoms you are able to spend will mean that 1) they have to increase the effort in making new shop exclusive items, 2) you will have bought everything when "limited" items will return to the shop, and 3) you will get an access on atoms unable to spend...(except you can buy a private server with atoms)
---
TL;DR: As long as you keep constantly buying atoms (1000/week) they will have no reason to increase the rewards of challenges...
---
i disagree because collecting all the bio cards means no one can slip in behind u and jack your launch
---
A level 12 started shooting me and messaging me asking for stuff when I didn't reply. So I shot him in the face. 
---
I like helping out but only when I feel like it.
---
I sold a "You have been insulted" note in my vendor for 1c once lol.
---
lol boy so i ever
---
care to share? 😁
---
I’ve been stuck with Heart of the Enemy for months with no option to restart the generators, and a 0.5w DNA sample in my misc that I can’t get rid of. I can’t finish or restart the quest, so I’ve never completed it. I’ve tried going back to the Asylum, going back through all of Scribe Grant’s stuff, no luck.
---
The same character did Someone to Talk To once, and it’s never reappeared. Only one of my three characters ever gets that quest to reappear as a daily, and naturally he’s the one that’s terrible with rifles and uses power armor. Given that I’d like both the tattered field jacket and shielded raider plan, it’s a bummer that daily never spawns for 2/3 of my characters, and maybe once every two weeks for the character that can repeat it.
---
&gt;Burr no one was talking to me. burrr ba Burr cool story dude. sorry you stuck out at Chili's tonight.
---
I feel bad calling you a twat now that I realized your a bit...less developed up there than the rest of us
---
it's the internet buuuuuuuuuuddddy. no one is really talking to anyone in comments like yours. they are just circle jerking . 
---
why? I dunno.
---
I come here to laugh and scratch my head. and occasionally trade pixels.
---
these little boots though. make me realize some pls us still aren't that socialized. 
---
all good
---
 all good.
---
these aren't even paragraphs but like..
---
well spoken word.
---
btw.. all that rage .. twatt being your default. Hmm 
---
gotta look under the hood. That reals incel.
---
regardless... 
---
well.. disregard that.
---
learn how to talk to a lady and be a gentleman.
---
you'll go places
---
This the same vault tec that made a vault of addicts and put them in rehab only to introduce a massive drug stash? Or the one that pumped gas through concealed vents and watched the population tear itself apart. Don't forget the one that developed child soldiers either...
---
hmmm keep going there Captain shovel. I'm fine.
---
map76.com, search for Stealth Boys and choose the the option that starts with “LPI_”.
---
there are 67 world spawns.
---
they’re all marked very well on the map but you’ll still have your work cut out for you.
---
thankyou much!!😁😁
---
you’re gonna lose sleep trying to find quite a few of them haha
---
Captain shovel lol haven't heard that before. What else ya got for me?
---
This, and the scrip reset. But it would be ok to see it in the terminal or a kind or new holotape (like the nuklear silo status holotape).
---
I sent you a friend request.
---
It has merit
---
I may be rolling Intelligence 1 but.. ahem ... your the one hanging out in threads titled " do weeds weaken memory" and claiming you likey.
---
does this guy fuck?
---
nope.. no not applicable.
---
also- 75% of your trades don't get any hits...
---
I saw this the other day and the junk pile mid-far west. There were like four of them just chilling out, all “Hi, Dave. Morning, Terri.” over there.
---
&gt;Jesus Christ the fucking fan boys in this sub are hilarious
---
Huh. Fans in a sub dedicated to the game, go figure! 
---
Also trolls who either don't play the game at all or who have hundreds of hours into and still say it sucks. Trolls.
---
Do we?
---
i never knew about this site 😁 its gona help with so much, i really appreciate this
---
Can I just get a hug?
---
Nah those just speak for yourself being lonely enough to go thru a stranger's history to try and insult them to feel better about yourself. Give me something else that's funny like captain shovel
---
It’s up to the vendor. I seen it for 50-100 caps.
---
nothing, just the door. 
---
which your used to because.
---
ain't no party for you.
---
nope.
---
your the guy who everyone hours up to smoke and then..
---
has to go home to bathe their cat? Grandma 
---
.... vaccum?
---
save it.
---
you'll go far in this trajectory.
---
not today.. it means too much and you are responding too quick.
---
you win.
---
but your bath sucked and your overdramatic and need to relax. this game is legit. I'm a beta player and..
---
your just beta.
---
byeeeeeeeee
---
it’s populated from actual game data, ie. not like a crowd-sourced site. it’s crazy accurate. 
---
how i get it to work best is i use it on my phone. i zoom all the way in on the location i want then i use the minus option to zoom out only 1 time. 
---
items line up just past the tip of your player location arrow but not all the way to the center of the arrow.
---
You were lucky with that griefer trust me
---
Requirements: 
---
x1 cute puppers
---
x1 little girl
---
x1 Alchemy ability
---
Wait. Something went horribly wrong in the process. Should I try this again?
---
I know of one are you on PC?
---
It’s nice to be surprised. 
---
It’d be nicer if we could have our character name above our head instead of our account title. 
---
I doubt anyone in Fallout is named FallSquish420pooppoop.
---
If they will not help with puzzles they will be useless, in the vault you fight against the clock by doing puzzles as fast as you can, mobs in raid doesn’t matter.
---
Yeah. Do this. Yes yes yes!
---
Stealth VATS commando with J25 Handmade, Plasma Rifle or Fixer. SentAss. Good luck with obtaning the best gear, though.
---
5200scrip only thing im keeping for trade is junkies swingspeed.reduced weight mole miner. Everything else was trash broadsiders etc..
---
Some people just want to turn this game into GTAV. 
---
I haven't had this experience yet. But I can see how it can be frustrating, especially as the game initiates defend missions every 30 bloody seconds when you take over a damn workshop.
---
B25 Fixer, B10 Fixer, AA33 Fixer, lvl 5 TSE hunting rifle
---
After the first time or the last time?
---
Bloodied explosive 50. Cal... still huntin a dream..
---
Dont be sorry, the action hero is not so good anyways, you will find better one to paint
---
I have a prime zealot's crossbow. I had chameleon when I first got it, used it just fine. What I disliked most about the chameleon was spooking mobs will sneaking, changing weapon or stand still to long.
---
«i would buy it fron the store even» 
---
Please no :(
---
If I get another one I'm gonna sell it for 500c next time.
---
This is epic stuff, you got my upvote ..
---
If you don't like exploring... I don't think this is the game for you...
---
It tried on a scorched and it was 13k damage. On a scheepsquatch it was 4.7k ,so i don't think it would be that extreme on the queen. I'm sure i'm missing much though, as i remember a video where i dude one shotted her.
---
Yes
---
Just the other day I was at a camp that sold a t-60 jetpack plan for only 200 caps, and ultracite mod plans for 50. Easy to say that made my day.
---
*Be [careful](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IaGi1HLYhC8) what you wish for.*
---
As if them game has been lore friendly but pint-sized slasher would be really cool
---
You need 9 points in agility though.
---
Black water mine where uranium fever is.
---
&gt; 76 never stood a chance because no matter what Bethesda did it has a sub community completely dedicated to destroying it.
---
No, 76 never stood a chance because it was released half developed and poorly designed. Fans (or anyone who bought it) and potential customers getting angy is a consequence, not the cause of 76's failure.
---
100% yes. I'm not that savvy as in I don't know how to get screenshots from my Xbox over to my iPad, so no idea how else to share problems. I saw a camp with thousands of the same high value items obviously duped, also one last week with racial slurs on their camp
---
Zenimax was created by the same people as Bethesda in part as a publicly traded funding vehicle for Bethesda and and a holding company. They still both have the same CEO. They are effectively the same company.
---
Yeah, but that's subject to change any time they do anything...
---
Thats good to know!
---
You're one of the good ones.
---
Well I'm used to it now, so I don't want it now.
---
&gt; **After Wastelanders and after various bug fixes** 
---
That could be a while.
---
This is actually a great tip!
---
I'd just hope Bethesda would allow us turn off the event triggers.
---
FREE SCRAP!!
---
Nuclear winter is a totally different animal. You don’t get to bring in any of your weapons and perk cards are unique to that game mode FYI.
---
What is this "friends" you speak of?
---
Whaaaaat?  You can mod automatics to use 0 ap?
---
you're basically saying you dont wanna lvl up and have instant elite gear rofl
---
Nice! I have a lot of fun in that mode. Morgantown is a great map
---
Legendary -25% mod, automatic receiver on semi/auto weapon (i.e. handmade, combat rifle, 10mm). Dot sights, forceful stock, swift magazine, everything else aligned.
---
Enjoy.
---
Yep I was in the same boat
---
I mean... Is it installed?
---
My 4th character I pre made level 20, 30. 40 and 50 versions. It was amazing to level on rifleman / commando.
---
add me on ps4 with 'fo76' in request 
---
check out vendor for plans, cheap as fuck too
---
The failure rate shouldn’t be high if people did their jobs (pylons)
---
Holy crap! After logging in this just happened! There was a Scavenger bot just standing off in the distance and from the sky fell 100+ mines! What the hell is happening to the wasteland? LOL
---
Well, is it?
---
No way. Your a stealth sniper, unyielding will help you not be detected so you wont need bolstering. Definitely use serendipity 3 as it basically cuts damage taken in half tho for only 3 points. When I pvp I also put on lone wanderer 4 and dodgy 3 as well as switching one unyielding piece for a chameleon piece
---
I also think that we should gather them all together and have a gladiator battle.
---
Nah keep Dogmeat only for the main entries.
---
Can you imagine how much stuff would vanish into thin air if Bethesda wrote the coding for this idea
---
Sound great, when r u on?
---
Look up “vox syringer” on the wiki, all the details about it are there
---
40k for my legendary reduced carry weight shovel. It's like you can't even feel it in your pocket 😎
---
Literally everyone but myself and my teammate.
---
Well you add The Fixer to your list of options from the Purveyor rolls. It’s kind of like a 4* weapon.
---
I like the rerecorded voice lines.
---
There will be fishing in the wastelanders update, it was shown in the trailer…
---
Well there you go. The SBQ only flies away from everyone if she can’t get to them. Next time tell everyone to get on the ground if they don’t want this happening.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9OmHxl-hEs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9OmHxl-hEs)
---
that's my junkies unarmed build.
---
My teammate actually tried to tell them but noone listened 😔
---
ohh that I completely forgot about it being repurposed but yeah I can see why it's unusual
---
That's really cool. I can never understand how can someone sell anything in this game for more than 500 caps. Even rare items. It's an absurd.
---
Thank you
---
Awaiting private servers for best experience ;)
---
There was one in my camp a few days ago. Two steps forward 3 steps back ya know....
---
Ok, I'll make sure to comb through the whole thing today and make sure it's updated
---
No. Acquiring new weapons over time is part of the fun. If I had the same weapon the entire time I would get bored. This was a welcome change. It doesn’t take long to get to level 50 anyway- then you can have access to any weapon you want. I appreciated the challenge when I was a lower level and miss it.
---
I’ll definitely be on the look for those armor pieces then, had no clue they increase stealth. Thanks for the info
---
Well, he doesn't claim that its a proved fact that the company is going public, and he is trustworthy enough to believe his theory. 
---
I don't get why you so easily dismiss him, he has a popular channel with hundreds of thousands of views.
---
Purveyor was great! I got some awesome explosive handmades and plenty of cool 3* stuff to sell in my shop. Great for business!
---
Who gave this a silver 😅
---
&lt;3
---
What in blue grass tarnation is a twitch drop?! Don't make me shake my walking cane at the lot of ya..
---
I think that cheeky ghoul Amy Kerry needs to stop getting up and changing her terminal password every day before going back to the Creamery and playing dead.
---
Excellent sneak rifle, so amazing for that class. Heavy as hell, but good for any toon, that sneak bonus is sweet.
---
Yea true! Also canonically idk how the Children of Atom fit in but tbh I never played 4 but I heard a lot about em and they seem cool!
---
You can try downloading the new files into the folder that contains the old game files - the Bethesda launcher might verify goid install rather than redownload
---
Quad rock on the db
---
Damn, thats a sweet haul!!...the day my character pulls even one of those would be glorious... but it won't and that is just hilarious. 90% of what you pulled I have never even seen drop in this game..lol  Been since day 1 beta level 200+...never had an explosive weapon drop, never seen a two shot drop, (did have a quad telsa drop tho) never had a lever gun drop, no rare plans. Of course, I'm not PC (XBOX) but the "RNG" for me has always stood for Repeatedly Nothing Good..lol  Sucks...was pissed about it for awhile but now I just realize its not going to change, same loot pools will remain in rotation, no matter the server, time or "RNG".  People pulling real, usable weapons will keep grinding and loving it and those who keep pulling Furious shovels, rolling pins, ultracite laser pistols, wood armor, bats, pipes and garbage unusable stuff will eventually fade away.  Keep pulling those gems!  I'm glad someone is getting them!
---
Hells yea! So HYPED, I was so bummed when they canceled it to next year they better make it worth it!
---
Nice idea but rather than DLC, how about a free update? 
---
I know they have now shown they will go back on their word (cosmetics only) but they did say this game would be free updates only and no DLC.
---
I’m 99% sure you could fix your teammates camps at release, don’t know what happened
---
Yeah I did the event twice the other day and got lucky with both attempts being successful. Some guy sold me the plans for 9999 so pretty much a steal and if I get the plans again I can sell them for more than I bought them.
---
A lot
---
It’s just a delay. I think it will be worthwhile. Problem is now everyone’s expectations will be huge lol
---
Yea facts
---
I just serve hop. Fixes every time
---
Raider Armor plans in my opinion are the 2nd hardest to get. You only have one chance per character play through at the end of Rose's/Raiders quest line to have less then 1% to get the plans.
---
I think having the huge benefit of being literally invisible should also have some downsides. 
---
That’s why people are abusing stealthboys. 
---
A game is not fun when there is an OP element with no downsides that everyone exploits. It kills meta and diversity.
---
That's what I'm wondering, since I just ranted.
---
Thanks to the donater though (my first medal).
---
Just play RDR2 of you really want Bethesda to try and make FO76 a clone of RDR2.
---
Raider outfit. Very rare reward low drop rate from the mire daily quests and the mire events. That should be cherished, very lucky.
---
I just have the camera guy permanently marked on my map even after doing the quest
---
I have rented out guns to friends before, they always gave it back as I was their source for mass amounts of ammo!
---
You got a lot of Vampire's in the beginning. Do you generally see many of these in your world drops with those characters?
---
They first appeared in FO3, but weren't in NV because they don't seem to have a presence on the West Coast. They're basically religious fanatics who believe every atom contains a universe and fission explosions are a divine miracle that creates new universes, viewing the dropping of the bombs as a grand holy event ushering in a new era of Atom. Some of their members seem to have a mutation that makes them immune to radiation and ghoulification (which they consider a sign of their being Atom's chosen), while others are just normal humans who can be ghoulified. My guess is in Appalachia, they would view mutations as signs of Atom's favor.
---
Only issue with introducing them in FO76 is that they call their deity Atom, so with the Atom Shop, the jokes whining about prices write themselves.
---
Probably unintended.
---
Said that I never checked how rare it actually is.
---
I was locked out from the dailies in The Mire for months which means that I might have done Play Time maybe 20-25 times since last November and I've got it to drop twice.
---
Might be a fluke, as a said I never checked the .esm for the actual odds.
---
I had a similar issue with making an alt account of my gf's console.
---
I figured if there was minimum level to initiate PVP (level 5) maybe there is a minimum level to do player to player trade. I rushed through some quests and was eventually able to character to character trade with my alt account.
---
Super useful having a 2nd account for so many reasons.
---
I believe they may have fixed ecological Ballance so that you don't need to collect that password everytime. I've been running it for the past serval days without needing to go get the password. Of course it's Bethesda so it could just be a glitch lol
---
Not yet they are future content
---
Does anyone know when they are coming out? Before wastelanders?
---
Been playing MMOs for years so this seems normal to me.
---
No idea yet Bethesda is dead silent about anything but waislanders
---
Oh good God 😂😂😂 That's understandable
---
I know you asked for Bags of Cement locations but you can build a Concrete Extractor at Poseidon power plant.
---
That’s dissapointing
---
If they removed it you would find level 5 walking around with insanely OP weapons that their friend gave then
---
I love this game but... bruh
---
We are limited in ways we can't imagine and for someone like yourself, it's even harder. Wtf I wish we didn't have players doing that
---
People got sick of Bloodied build griefing in Survival and workshops in Adventure, so Bethesda added a cap that effected the entire game. Adventure griefing is still an issue, but Survival is gone now and high damage, low fire rate weapons remain useless in NW.
---
That’s basically 76 in a nutshell disappointing
---
Enforcer has been emancipated from the shotgun build, it belongs to every build now.
---
Rifleman...melee...handsy melee...pistols...we all use at least a few points in Enforcer lol
---
I mean in some areas definitely. Still fun though
---
So it increases sneak just like that?
---
Yea definitely has some fun areas but they could have done so much better
---
Yeah
---
Not everyone wants to hold hands and ride your Mr Fuzzy bullshit
---
Aaaaw he is so cute! I will use that as Wallpaper, thank you so much for sharing!
---
That's either a very recent patch (I turned it off months ago because I got sick of having to get the password every time) or mine is just glitched, which makes me sad.
---
*what the hell happened here?*
---
You created a Centaur.
---
Just find the camp unit, it has a fix all option....just saying
---
Yes, that's what is missing. Works only on your own.
---
Yep! Based on the character's level!
---
I had done the same thing for the longest time but the other day my game glitched a bit and turned it back on so I decided to go ahead and run it but it never gave me a marker to go find the password. I've done it several times since then and haven't had to get the password yet
---
Probably the same person who whines about atoms being too expensive yet buy silvers on Reddit.
---
Can't wait to nuke some fish.
---
Wait until the gain intelligence and become our Robot overlords... 
---
On that note "I welcome our robot overlords" [bows graciously and dons tinfoil hat]
---
That is pretty sweet :)
---
I have spent 8.7k scrip combined this weekend all on 3\* armor - where the odds of getting what I am after are the poorest - and out of 290 instances I got no 'wow' pieces, 2 nice ones, about 5 that are serviceable and all the rest scrip.
---
Still, given the horrendous odds when it comes to looking for a specifc piece of armor I am going to call it a success considering the small amount of effort involved vs something like getting raider armor plans for instance.
---
Lets get these guys back together
---
Ah it's all good! I have a hell of a time finding them in the wild so I'll give it a try!
---
Agreed bro. I’m surrounded by flamers and crossbows, broadsiders, harpoon, you name it. Bought my handmade for a lot of caps. I just want a load of vendors I can shop through without the legendary grind, cos it’s just crap that drops every time.
---
I mean there has to be a trade off to becoming completely invisible.
---
I'm not sure about the Hasty reciever or how new you are to fo76 but here are a few tips.
---
1. Buy the plan for the weapon you want mods for then craft the lowest level version of that weapon and scrap it then you will learn mods.
---
2. Bolt Action Pipe Pistols and Revolvers can double dip on perk cards (Riflemen and Gunslinger) all you have to do is add any rifle stock to your pistol to be able benefit from the Riflemen Perks.
---
3. Adrenal Reaction Serum will boost your damage.
---
What platform are you on? PS4 doesn’t seem bad at all for wait times.
---
I do use melee! But it's not like raiders use that shit on purpose, they use it cause it's common. If a raider found an actual good gun they wouldn't pass it up
---
Okay, but no one has told me how that is an actually bad thing nor provided any counter argument that addresses the fact that every other game in the series worked this way. 
---
If someone can explain why the game is actually better for the level locking beyond artificially extending playtime i would be ecstatic. 
---
My main question being why would anyone care about low level players who even with this change would still be far weaker than anyone with more experience having the ability to use high tier guns. 
---
Cause i really can't think of any situation in the game that is made worse in any way by people being able to use whatever they find, even if a level 300 drops a fully modded TSE combat shotgun at a level 1's feet the only person who that affects at all is the level 1 who now can fast track them self to the endgame and just be on par with everyone else. 
---
Yeah you can make the argument that that player will have less incentive to keep playing but that incentive is already completely gone for anyone the instant they hit 50 which the vast majority of players already have on their mains, so i just do not understand why this change would bother anyone.  
---
It really seems from the dissenting comments i have gotten and the downvotes on some of my counter arguments that the main reason some people don't like this idea is not that it makes the game worse but that they would be pissed off at anyone having an easier time grinding up to endgame than they did. 
---
If that is the wrong assumption then please anyone actually explain your logic for keeping the current system because i really am very interested in knowing why people like it.
---
I can smell your salt from here lmao
---
There's a mod on nexus to shut him up.
---
Higher level gear should have a special requirement, not a level one! And even then let you weild it without that special requirement, but with a penalty to damage or accuracy!
---
I was thinking of just flat level scaling of all equipment augmented by the perks that are already in the game, but this idea is actually much better.
---
I always craft low levels a Brotherhood recon rifle and if they play the game for long enough, a handmade! Would be nicer if we can make them better stuff too!
---
Please and thank you
---
It's how Fallout 1/2/Tactics handled it, I think New Vegas had this as well, I can't remember though!
---
I wouldn't hold your breath fallout 4 was the same
---
Same thing happened to me, nuke mines out of nowhere.
---
I'm new with this thing of god rols, legendaries, I just judged legendary by there damage and how effective they are. Btw what's FFR? Maybe is a dumb question but as I said, I'm new with legendary items 😅
---
Yes! Three eyes fish!
---
I dunno, I always sell them for 10c a map.
---
Y.E.S
---
This is super wholesome. Your bud sounds like the human equivalent of a golden retriever, hope you reconnect!
---
Never heard of anyone finding anything rare in them usually the best you get is the dragon gun I dug up plenty and got mostly nothing and never a stared weapon or plans. It's fun but don't get your hopes up
---
I’m just buying junk legendary for 10-20 caps per scrip and then I go huge on every purveyor sale, caps are much easier to make then scrip.
---
Commando vastly outperforms rifleman in PvE too! I'm using far less ammo for faster kills when I changed to full auto!
---
If you go into the service entrance you will only have one load screen
---
Oh furious explosive sounds great, that's a dream.
---
I've heard that you can get the dense mod plans from treasure maps for cranberry bog but that's really all I can recall at the moment. I can tell you that the luck giving better quality loot is really just a misunderstanding. What it really does is give you weapons and armour with better condition bars
---
I haven't poured through the tangled mess that is the levelled lists for the treasure maps so I cannot be 100% certain however I am fairly confident that the only current way to get the raider armor plans is via doing Signal Strength until you get them.
---
If I would have found an easier way I would have gladly taken that route. The 'create character &gt; complete Signal Strength as fast as possible &gt; delete character &gt; rinse and repeat' ringer is gotten really old now even though I have a fairly streamlined process that allows me to do this multiple times per hour.
---
Never got one from a treasure map and I have use 1000s across multiple characters.
---
No I’m not able to see any pattern with my legendary drops
---
Heard of people getting power armor plans, rarest thing I got from them is a stimpack...
---
You know, it's not like I didn't do maps - it's my 4th or 5th big dig, but I never found anything awesome apart from PA pieces plans, so wanted to know if I'm unlucky or just there is no chance to get something rare.
---
I'm a handyman build, so I change my build for the situation. Now I'm finishing to level up my barbarian perk, should I begin with heavy weapon?
---
 No
---
I was walking in the savage divide yesterday and came across 8 all stood together not saying a word in the woods
---
I don't like scopes but this is why I still use scopes.
---
True story friend. I've been overweight after every random scorched/mutant encounter, not even a scorched/mutant camp, imagine the tons and tons of weapons they drop...
---
I needed this yesterday. Shot down a cargo bot while at someone's camp to shop. The vertibots ended up taking out most of this camp as they exploded. I felt terrible and tried repairing what i could find. The base was a bit "abstract" so i couldn't figure out what was actually broken and what wasn't! So the repair all would have been good.
---
Although it sounds weird, there's a reason why every RPG out there uses this sort of restriction.
---
How do punji boards in a workshop make a player wanted?
---
My instigating explosive lmg cares to argue with that statement. I can pretty much just spin in circles spewing death.
---
Then I hope it gets even better friend :D.
---
Idk i got a 3* zaines 10mm yesterday that bullets explode and it still 1 shots everythig and same goes for my shotgun that does explosive damage.
---
Speech lvl 100
---
In the beta my friend and I went on a quest to find fishing poles... we were very sad to see we couldn't fish with them.
---
No thanks, I'm trying to do a heavy weapon build. Maybe after doing that build I can sell you the weapon. I'm on Ps4 btw.
---
You know what would make Bethesda add this to the game by telling them its what Fornite does too which is true you can fish in game now.
---
would have
---
Yeah you're right. But with some perks I can do a great thing out of that weapon.
---
It one shots the queen?
---
This isn't a good reason. You can sneak in and out of a small PvP zone pretty easily, and I have serious doubts that you're hopping multiple times daily to avoid unwanted workshop PvP. I actively seek out PvP, workshops or otherwise, on a constant basis and can't imagine having one quest objective in that area would be much of a hassle. People are so over dramatic about PvP in this game.
---
At least you'd know where PvP players hang out.
---
Yeah a quest-marked holotape that lets you access those quests from the Pip-Boy would be nice. After all we linked MODUS to a space station, we can also link him directly to our Pip-Boy.
---
One of the reason nobody actually deciphers the nuclear codes is that's a lot of trouble activating the quest to localise an Officer eight freaking times.
---
FFR: 25% Faster Fire Rate. It is often on par with Explosive regading kill time.
---
please enlighten the ignorant - whats so special about it, other than it is apparently hard to find?
---
Hell no. U take it too lideral. Smh. Noting can 1 shot the queen unless ur hacking.
---
Thanks for clarify :)
---
OP is upset and has been borderline harassing commenters who disagree that their negative encounter was with a seriously mentally deranged person who has threatened their livelihood (by suggesting they’re a flat-earther). 
---
Some people have responded saying that it’s probably just someone messing with them (as that happens somewhat regularly in any online game)—or just a weirdo to simply be dismissed—and that it shouldn’t be taken too seriously. OP is seeking confirmation and validation of their experience and is pissed as hell that not everyone agrees that they should feel legitimately  threatened.
---
Just my take, though 🙂
---
Yeah i understand that, but to not compensate people for the bugs caused is a bit shitty especially when its such a small amount.  
---
Its like refusing to give someone a drink they tried to get from a vending machine that didnt drop but still ate their money
---
I know, sorry! I knew what you meant. But the problem I had with the meat hook is that with the right build it can kill the queen far to quickly.
---
Maybe any weapon has the capability to inflict massive damage yes, but the meat hook is still bugged. It's not meant to double dip into perks, mutations, food buffs egg. It's a developer oversight, if it was intentional then more weapons would do it.
---
Constantly. I saw one working one who said atuff when I interacted with them. But all others have been glitched and you can't interact with them.
---
I mean has anyone actually tried this?
---
You wan't to be a settler? But you were just let out of a vault to inhabit a destroyed world - This doesn't make any sense. Now go shoot at a flying lizard. Come now. Off you go. 
---
You can't scrap fixers
---
The real endgame with this sale was finding the right stuff to scrip in order to get precisely all 150 scrips so I could try three times for the day lol
---
Yesterday I needed a single 1* piece of armor to get the last 3 scrips from the machine and after farming West-Tek overencumbered three times with no luck I had to nuke the freaking queen to find a legendary enemy.
---
Then we could have a feature that allows you to turn off player trading.
---
The vending machines get limited at times and our players have to carry the excess items we can't put in stash boxes. The scrip machines run out of scrip and the vendors run out of money at times.
---
They can just suck it up. I had others complain and I just ignore them. They will learn soon enough.
---
Like camouflage?
---
Thats it. Its hard to find. But of all the hard to find asylum outfits, its the easiest.
---
I still hate dialog trees. Being the completionist type having to go through every possible conversation point, it was refreshing to load a holo and keep it moving. 
---
Trees work for games but now it feels unnatural standing in one spot going through trees watching some npc strike vogue poses.
---
While you’re at it allow both scrip and caps to stack day by day,some people don’t play everyday
---
I do loads of treasure maps and it keeps my vendor stocked in not so common plans. Every now and again I get a new plan that I don’t know and I thought I had them all. I’ve learnt nearly all the armour mods from scrapping what I’ve got off the maps. I got a dense leather plan from a Mire treasure map last week. I spend most of my gameplay travelling to vendors hoping to buy maps. Well worth it.
---
Some other people on this sub theorized Beth doesn't want people grinding for hours, but they want daily log ins instead
---
You on PlayStation?
---
You can buy any gun or armor with cash on ebay. Ran into a guy yesterday that paid $25 for an explosive gatling laser. That is way more ptw than anything bethesda has put in the atom shop. Problem is bethesda gets zero of that to support the game.
---
The same way they did before Reddit and social media.
---
People have ideas and then implement them except now you might have to take into account what  206k people might also like otherwise risk being branded as not "community-friendly" And honestly there is a reason why people go to college to learn game design and normally have it as a long term career rather than just going on what peoples surface level suggestions on what they "want" right this second.
---
Did he remove you from friends list or something? I hope you guys meet up again.
---
Went in with around 500 scrip.
---
I got a 3\* vampire broadsider....
---
but I supposed that was offset by the 3\* ultracite gatling laser :)
---
The fixer is a combat rifle not an assault rifle.
---
Good, at least I have and confirmation about possibility to get dense plans, not only PA pieces plans.
---
Nah man on Xbox
---
A dead meme for a dead game. You don’t even need the photo mode pose, you just need to play for more than five minutes at a time and it’ll happen
---
I met one but ir just waddled around. What are they supposed to do
---
I’ve been doing them for months and probably done way over a 2000 and it was the first one I’ve had. I do 20 maps in one place at a time. Cranberry, Mire and Savage are the best.
---
Yes yes yes
---
Yes, I almost have more than 20 in each location and I collect all except the forest ones. Looks like I'll do digging in the next weekend.
---
You said you learned it correct? Here's your sign...
---
Similair to what I'm doing, I'm doing a HND Game development course but at the same time i like to take feedback and develop on an idea given by the community
---
It's a perfectly valid reason for them to not change how workshop PvP works without also making a bunch of other changes too.
---
I'm a low population area and play at non-peaks times so there's often only 1-2 servers available, just today I had to hop 4 times to find a different server as there were 7 people duking it out at the munitions factory and there was no way I could find and disarm 4 bombs within the building itself without being drawn into the battle.
---
There's also places like Berkeley Springs and Tyler County where the deafult spawn/travel point is within the workshop zone. Beth would have to change those spawn points and quest areas if they altered things so that you don't need to contest to be considered hostile.
---
Not 100% on this but historically in all fallout games and recipes are consumables.
---
When I forst started, I would take Posiedon in the middle of the night - between 2-3 am...fewer players around to take it from me. 
---
Eventually learned where all the forest PA spawn points were located.  That solved the problem...
---
I swear they fixed that issue a while ago. I remember seeing a post about it and one of the CM responded that they are working on fixing it
---
Yeah it’s best to do a lot at once. The only thing is you’ll be over encumbered at one spot doing 20.  I tend to do 2 spots every day, just to supply my vendor. Don’t forget to use scrapper perk to get extra mats.I’ve done that many I don’t even have to look at YouTube to find them.
---
No
---
each letter will cost 250 atoms, but if you buy it in the bundle for 850 atoms, you also get the T pose for free
---
planting in pots indoors  is the #1 thing.
---
I can see this being a reward that has a .001 chance of dropping
---
If you used the recipie to lea4n how to make it the recipie will be gone from your inventory as happens with all recipes and plans you learn, you can make the serums to sell but you used the recipie.
---
I tried did an experimental mini build in a pond on one of my alt accs. And can confirm everything works fine underwater Only issue is we cannot have walls or rooms as such, just benches beds and other items sat atop a concrete block. Which can then be sunk to bottom of a lake/pond/river. It worked fine, my character slept under water for an hour with auqua boy perk, but he still got waterborne diseases, but as I am a plague walker it doesn't bother me much.
---
all that wood and metal. something I desperately need for my ultracite ammo
---
The first plan or recipe you ever learned was for a serum? Or you just never noticed they always disappear before?
---
No worries, maps are usually in not very crowded spots and I run unyielding build with 550+ capacity (with high capacity backpack and many perks lowering weight), so I can easily do up to 3 spots before I'll need to go to stash to unload the crap I've collected ;)
---
Not just fishing... they should make a whole water-themed expansion. New water/underwater plants and food. Water-theme CAMP parts to build our own boathouse, lighthouse or a dock. "Water-mill" generator for moving water. Aquaculture for food. Bring back Nuka-lurks. Introduce Beer-lurks just for the sake of having a wacky questline with Biv: "The mire-loorks are so angry because they drink that smelly water, hic. Try giving them some Beer, it's what made me such a nice fellow!".
---
which means you will need to respec your main character to use that perk for NW. it is fucking bullshit imo.
---
I tried contacting support, took a week of getting the runaround.  they then finished the ticket by saying it was something they might look in to.  no refund.
---
Yes and trapping.
---
We have fishing poles. Can’t wait for some damn mutated ass fish.
---
You get to the point where you could buy serum recipe from enclave vendor and don't know how plans/recipes works? That you "consume" it upon learning?!?!
---
I have high capacity backpack and only use it doing maps. Good luck treasure hunting.
---
go to one of the known spawn points.  If its not there, server hop. 
---
Repeat until camera found. 
---
I did it at wavy willards.  If Ansel wasnt there -  Go inside, kill all the scorched, loot the lockers by the wave pool (found a few bobbleheads), server hop, and repeat.  Took about an hour.
---
thank you ;)
---
Try maintaining some of the best weapons as a level 10. I agree there will need to be a balance, but level requirements are stupid. 
---
A good change might be that if you are under leveled an increase in the rate of degradation.
---
Sometimes the question the author wants to be answered is instead "Is the game perfect?"and argues that the game is not "good yet" when there are issues remaining. Sometimes the question is not even asked in good faith. And when asked in good faith, people need remember that this is Bethesda. Bethesda is one of the companies that will never make something perfect. Obsidian is another example. Bethesda game or Obsidian game will always have this specific kind of "jank", this unpolished-ness.
---

---
West coaster usually on at 3 my time :)
---
You read it. It's gone but you can now craft said serum. That's how it works.
---
Also you can get the cost down to 17500 with a full set of unyielding armor @20%health, 
---
Lvl 3Hard Bargin, lvl 3 Party boy grape mentats and a beer.
---
I agree with this lol
---
Bethesda are going to read this as 'after wastelanders can we pay 9.99 for different dirt'
---
The traveling leather coat has a drop rate of .02 and with the mire quests bugged for so long they are very rare.  If you look on the trading sub that we are not allowed to talk about you will find people selling them between 18k and 20k caps, I have seen as high as 30k a couple of times.
---
My first one came via a friend who also bought it from a vendor and I accidentally  scrapped it.  I managed to find someone on the trading sub to trade an TSE Handmade for one to replace it.  Finally, last month after playing the game for almost a year I had one drop from the Queen of the Hunt quest, I was ecstatic.  There is a matching green hood that is a natural world spawn but it is also very hard to find.  After looking for many months I managed to find one in a player vendor.
---
You can just add him from recent players
---
I make sure to give them a heart emote before moving right along.
---
theres actually quite a bit at WS.  Make the loop around the cottages, pick up all te buckets, etc.  Once the golf club is clear, go to all the tables in the dining room.  get the knives, forks, and spoons.  (each utensil is 1 steel.)
---
Toolchests and toolboxes in the laundry building... then go across the street to blackwater - you dont have to go into the mine - kill the moleminers - miner suit for black titanium, breathers for steel.  plus their weapons, plus all the other junk there.
---
Plots and planters would be very lit, even if we don't get any new plants to domesticate
---
Yesterday I had 4 of them in my camp.
---
So many games with majority DBs in it.  Not this game.  This and maybe L4D are the best for natural niceness
---
I'm saving mine I think (well I hope) they may update the loot for them in the future.
---
In PvE there's no doubt commando outperforms, having the critical hit frequency few times higher than rifleman.
---
The thing is in PvP besides the critical hit frequency, range is an important factor - each my shot does displays 110 damage, theirs don't do me damage on these distances.
---
I was commando sneaky sniper last six months, mastering the playstyle. If I say rifleman beats it, its mostly because I was beaten and I now beat using the rifleman.
---
I jumped to a hoard event at the scorched tunnel, and Graham was there! he was just going through, saying lines I hadn't heard before, sounding much more like a mutie than the meat cook guy... he was smashing guys from the back, I was head-popping the waves from the front... it was freakin awesome! I followed him for a while and I really remember how much I enjoyed having a follower. I really miss Gage following and making remarks about stuff. prolly gonna play fo4 after I get caps and scrip for today
---
I've been researching this not sure if you've found one yet but I did. It's actually good too I have 5 water purifiers the lead extractor and a decent camp with just enough room for crops..its right near the plane crash and heart of the swamp event. It's at the top of a cliff overlooking a waterfall. I was able to fit 2 purifiers at the top and 3 down and the bottom of the cliff. It's also a good map location for traveling. I haven't had anything attack my camp yet either. Hope this helps if you haven't found anything yet.
---
The Mothman Cult will be one of the subfactions in Wastelanders. Devs confirmed it at Quakecon.
---
Fallout 76 has so many possibilities for new factions. I really hope that Wastelanders serve us more than "Settlers" and "Raiders".
---
Old factions can get resurrected. The New Responders. Free States Reborn. The Reforged Brotherhood of Steel. Hell, even the Order of Mysteries can get reborn if our characters pass the credentials.
---
Grafton could have two new faction, divided on the stance toward current Grafton Mayor. One pro-mayor, other against. New elections are comming and the player has to choose who to support.
---
Speaking of Grafton Mayor, one of the robots could start a robot faction that is unhappy that meatbags are back in large numbers and taking over the automatised Appalachia.
---
And what about non-feral ghouls? They could learn what happened to the original non-ferals and as result turn into xenophobic faction and the player has to take a long time to earn their trust.
---
Why would you think that you can sell it after you learned it? Thats the same as firing a gun and then being able to sell the bullet.....
---
So your daily quest might actually be difficult once every few days. They nixed survival and that impacted way more people than 1 daily quest would. They absolutely need to add PvP zones into adventure mode or else people will continue to slap you down in your workshops out of no where.
---
Facts. It helps when you rock the raider icon too, I have more people politely ask for fusion cores than try and fight for them lol
---
Okay I'm intrigued. Is getting unique stuff a possibility or do we still have to use the atomic workshop for a lot of stuff?
---
I think the thing to consider here is that Bethesda is not a charity. it's not, not should it be, the responsibility of the consumer to keep a company afloat; that lies on the company and their decision making. Bethesda created this problem and now they're selling us a solution, which is really ridiculous.
---
"...is this the beginning of a new, terrifying planet of the horses?...."
---
They do actually, it’s just an incredibly low chance, like .01% or something
---
I know you're stocked with caps to roof, but I seriously doubt the value of time spent digging in virtual dirt. Personally I sell all plans for 50 caps; but to each his own, of course.
---
this evening, europe time
---
Not rare but not easy to get either.  I have completed this event successfully 30+ times and still no plan drop for me.  :(
---
There's a couple more around the area and the workshop produces cement as well, I think.
---
Nah, I really wanted another singleplayer Fallout experience, which is why i play super late when  the servers are mostly empty. I dont mind a challenge or even PvP, I just dont see the point in going out of your way to be a dick to a low level player. 
---
I'm mad at what someone did, not the game itself.
---
I tend to like to perch up high to get a better line of sight on incoming enemies. With that being said, when I jump up on the stumps that the bot is headed for, it breaks his pathing to that stump 100% of the time.
---
I now stay well out of the path, and only jump up on the stump after the new dialog has initiated.
---
However, this may not be your issue, and YMMV.
---
or, like, more poses/emotes in general.  forknife has all kinds of crazy dances and emotes
---
Reason for plan to be valuable: the fixer is games best nonlegendary rifle, and as a legendary rifle, it also is the best one.
---
You might roll The Fixer from the purveyor, provided that your character knows the recipe - characters that can't craft the fixer can't roll the weapon from purveyor.
---
I have 5 characters where I store legendaries and scrip items. I needed 5 plans to enable each of my characters to roll a fixer. I spent 60k on these plans for myself, as well as some more for my friends. More people want those and doesn't have the plans the higher the prices. More people have them already learned, the price lessens. Right now it's increasing but I bet in a month it will start decreasing as more people will already set in on all their toons they scrip with.
---
How are level requirement stupid? A low level player fresh out of 76 isn’t suppose to have end game gear. That’s not how a game like this works. All you and the OP seem to be are entitled people who don’t want to actually work for or put in the time to achieve something.
---
or for raids, too.  im a broken record, but 'eso has this' play the game while waiting to lobby fill for cyrodiil, dungeons, delves, etc
---
I haven't made any tutorials. At least not yet. But I believe it was a Sinister Hand or Jugg video I saw it in.
---
That may of been a reason for one of the events not working now that i dont perch and just spam jump with marsupial to spot easier its been working
---
Try adding a couple of zeros first. 
---
https://youtu.be/AZ1WYOqIabM
---
Start at about 13:00
---
I am extremely confused by this post as well lol
---
Have you been able to resell any other plan/recipe after you learn them? I
---
exactly.  its kinda cool that we finally get a way to do all our roleplay/pvp/solo w/ friends and we'll soon see a buncha posts of ppl advertising their community servers
---
Don't call a myth something that was definitely part of the game at some point - I haven't retested this myself recently, but definitely the first strangler opponents I met were able to OHKO me from hundred meters from explosive harpoon that dealt me 0 damage on hit then proceeded to shred my HP faster that I could outheal it with stimpacks.
---
Saying strangler PA deals 4hp in a game where you could literally multikill people with a single shot from hundreds of meters - this is a myth lol.
---
NW would be so much fun without the queuing.. I mean it’s obviously because there aren’t that much players who are playing that mode, do it takes a while to find a game. But this right here would be a good improvement!
---
I’m going to link this post in every “more build budget” post haha
---
This would be pretty cool.  They need to update all the water features in the game.  There really isn't anywhere cool to explore underwater.  No big lakes or rivers to explore.  I just feel like they could have done a lot more with it tbh.
---
I keep a ghoul slaying weight reduction shovel. just makes sense
---
My house spawned over one. I thought i had a new table until i realised it was a collectrons head.
---
I didnt think CAMPs could even spawn onto things.
---
Roleplayers were pretty screwed up having to deal with some randoms lol, I believe they must be as excited as us PvPers are
---
Any build and weapon from my understanding can do that. Idk been watching energy weapon builds since they buffed them and been sering players putting out 21k+ dps idk how they do there builds i cant touch that high.
---
wow, humble and informative, thanks!
---
At this time, there are no markers to delineate the edges of WS zones.
---
As such, it would way to easy to accidentally/unintentionally walk into a zone, initiating (unwanted) PVP.
---
Plasma casters
---
It's that expensive because BSG data shows that people will buy it at that price point. No more no less If no one bought it it would be cheaper and if more people are willing to buy it at the current price they might see if it would be more profitable to charge more and offset the loss of sales with larger price points. E.G you can sell 20 things for a dollar each or 1 thing of 20 dollars both get you 20 dollars but one of them only has you losing one thing (even though its digital information and thus does not actually disappear when used or copied people still think about it in those terms)
---
That's the idea.
---
It’s like you forget this is an online game. Pvp before level 50 was some of the most fun I had in this game. In most cases we both sucked and it made it much more fun and caused  some long intense battles. If there were no level caps on gear It would massively effect the sparse balancing in the game. Fresh players would never be able to compete with existing players who already farmed gear on their main that they can now just switch to a level one? A level 200 shouldn’t be using the same gear as a level one in any scenario. Also without these level caps there would only be one variant that just gets more powerful as you level up? Also sounds like a nightmare as level scaling often is.
---
Why would he be here?
---
If you're starving, you'd eat anything loaf.
---
Lol.
---
This perk is freaking annoying and shouldn’t be in the game, period. It destroys the fun completely for me, I was top three two times yesterday and got killed by a jumping moron with a grenade launcher two times. Takes no skill and it’s just annoying.
---
It does make the game worse. Have you ever played Diablo 2 or any other MMO. They all have level systems In place so people early on in the game aren’t over powered and can actually progress through the story. You come off as the type of person who doesn’t want to do the story but just be able to do what all the end game players are doing. You don’t want to earn anything for yourself you just want it handed to you.  You even say it yourself, “that player can fast track themselves to the endgame and be on par with everyone else”. That’s not how a fallout game is played. I’ve put hundreds of hours into this game, there are people who put thousands into it, you’re not suppose to just fast track yourself to the endgame.
---
I'm spoiled brat, just a honest one
---
You might accidentally wandered into a fissure site as well and get into an unwanted SB battle. That's how games work. Before you learn zones you accidentally wander into them, and sometimes die.
---
How about infinite, there's zero reason to limit it
---
Xbox gamertag: Paladin Bailey.
---
I'm co-founder/co-leader of a Brotherhood of Steel Discord (Xbox only) so if you're looking for people to back you up and feel like you actually are making a difference well look no further.
---
I'd rather they make equipment levels standardized between all gear. Why do some guns stop at level 45? Why arent more guns available in low-level variants?
---
Maybe you're right, since they completely weightless.
---
I’d never run out of food it’d be great
---
You haven't seen it used effectively. Put that on a full auto weapon and it stacks with each explosion and each projectile you can create so many stacks that you crash your game. Pretty sure that is broken.
---
no idea tbh
---
there should be alternatives I agree for explosive you can get the perk or a dense mod , I also think it should be a legendary modifer as well but thats just me
---
https://twitter.com/MrsP123/status/1184107700294209536?s=09
---
Oh my, you're right! There is one! It was completely hidden, because i put it in a corner and could even reach it. I'm stupid-o.
---
It was the closest thing to an actual role play environment this game had. The leaf eater servers are boring.
---
Not sure if this is a question or suggestion and you know the answer or not - but yeah, the Blue Camo paint from the shop works. Basically any atom shop paint makes them not show up trade windows. Blue Camo is available on some items, but not all.
---
Selling a known ...
---
Absolutely agree

---
Thank you! Why does something like this never come up when I Google this.
---
As it's been confirmed that none of the rare plans I'm after can drop from treasure maps (and I've already learned all PA pieces, as well as all dense plans), I think I'll just keep collecting them - maps weight nothing, so maybe they'll upgrade it's loot table in the future...

Good bloodbuild decimates ass/sent people and monsters with 1* gear, I do believe that bloodied sneaker is the games cheapest powerful build because it can rock in good hands on items that are free, but I also believe having less than 6 endurance is suicide and gunsmith is entirely optional and if used, level 3 gives out enough QoL. The fact that the best tier bloodbuild items are exceptionally demanded and expensive doesn't mean their 1* version sucks. They don't.
---
Other than that, you've expertly described the dangers related to bloodbuilds as well as the confusion PvE opponents present shortly before dying. Upvoted.
---
I guarantee they will be put in the atomic shop. Probably with wastelanders.
---
Thank you, I know of this YouTuber and I honestly can't stand their voice so I don't watch them.
---
oh shit, I found a reason I've had my forrest mask in my stash for so long
---
People can't ask if a game is good? Sounds like you're the obnoxious one.
---
Me personaly. I have mutations so while a lot of players say mutated suxs for weapons. Well it mey suck for n9n mutated players while thoes of us who have mutations get bonus dps from useing them.
---
I think having a sales terminal would be great.  Something that allows you to actually type in what items you have for sale whether they are being carried, stashed, or in your machine.

&gt;griefing in Survival
---
How do you grief in a 100% agreed upon PvP situation? Just curious.
---
Are you going on Xbox? I can help you out.
---
Explosive FFR Gatling lasers and quad FFR Tesla’s are it.  Cheese cannons indeed
---
You definitely could, I remember sometimes searching teammates camps to find the CAMP device to do just this
---
I've been away from the game for a few months due to travel, and it seems most of my friends stopped playing in the meantime. I'm in Europe, but am likely to stay up fairly late, so if you're up for it, feel free to add *AldorinDK*. I should be back home in a day or two.
---
There is no need to do so many things - it's been datamined, that CHR can lower price up to 25 points - above that there won't be any more discount ;)
---
Pretty sure I've sold some known plans
---
Early next year most likely.
---
Just because they added it to fortnite doesn't make it a worthwhile addition to other games.
---
This will never happen precisely because they want to get those people to play everyday.
---
Yeah since the load times approach GTA5 load times less loading is better.
---
I 100% agree. It’s a shame though
---
That seems like an oddly long wait for a relatively simple feature, but if they plan to roll it out with Wastelanders, I guess it makes sense. Cheers!
---
Yes, as TheMadHam mentioned, they plan to add Plasma Casters to the game in the near future.
---
This is correct! You don't get any extra Ultracite wearing Excavator. You do with all other Ore nodes though.
---
Got it! Thank you. I hadn't considered how easy Vault Tec's bright blue is to see. That makes sense. Thanks for the explanation and for not making me feel dumb while you did it!
---
Tough crowd.
---
People not grabbing the pylons and hiding on top of the shed piss me right off. 
---
Played the event and died multiple times and it failed.  Awesome.  I then decided to PvP those not doing their part so extracted some level of revenge.
---
Not really, what they said was that the DLCs would be free. Just google it. All the updates are part of season DLCs, so we already got two DLCs and paid nothing for them.
---
What platform are you on? I have a bit of handmade ammo laying around.
---
Kinda confused about the scavenging collectron. It seriiusly only holds 3-4 items at a time? That's near pointless.
---
That happens when someone is duping them and gets DC'd before picking them all up.
---
It should cease once the Server is reset.
---
Now I understand. When you add skins it would make that item not seen by others. Anything without a skin or paint would be seen. This would make sense and I feel this could work.
---
...There's no way in hell you been bored this ENTIRE time! lol
---
Of course we won't ever be friends. You obviously have snot ear, and that's gross.
---
Mainly because there is not a 30k cap on ammo. When we fill up with caps we hop around and try and buy up ammo to reduce our cap amounts. 
---
5.56 just happens to be the easiest to sell with .45 being very close imo.
---
Thanks for the tip, I will try that.  Although in the video you linked, nothing happens when the person enters the 6 digit code at first.  Meaning, no Green or Red Screen to confirm if it was accepted or not (until adding the extra zeros first).  When i do it the screen immediately turns Red after the 6 digits.  However, I will still try it later today when i can get back home to play it.  Again, thanks for the idea.
---
I don’t like it but it’s normal in MMOs.
---
It’s kind of stupid that it’s not you that are becoming stronger but your gear.
---
You’re weak without your gear, it is what it is though.
---
I appreciate the offer!! I’m on PC!
---
And everyone using something that overpowered is why I'm never gonna play NW
---
That means you picked another one up after you already knew it.  You have to use a plan at least once.
---
A great way to search and to inventory your supplies. Now that's a good idea.
---
I love finding wild collectrons! I’ll take pictures of them and just admire them and their silliness! I always just say they’re very dutiful and dedicated robots!
---
We've seen them add simple things that break a million other things in the past so I'd rather they wait and make sure they break as little as possible
---
That's a pretty sexy new side table you have there, friend!
---
Same here! Thought Im now away for a real military exercise but Il be back on friday, we could meet then.
---
Those were only duplicates lol.
---
The additional "legendary"  effect. But that's imho not needed when you are already running a high stealth build with marsupial. 
---
Whenever I got one, I sold it, because it actually does less damage than a handmade with the same legendary effetc.
---
It's the best rifle in the game and TSE shotgun are one of the worst
---
You really dont need that much intelligence, it would be better used in agility
---
Instigating weapons are good for levels upto 100. They provide excellent damage in the areas u r going to play during these stages. Get an Instigating two hand melee (with the maxed out slugger perks, u will one shot kill most enemies) and u r set to cruise thru next 75 levels smoothly..
---
Combat rifle that can technically have 4-5 legendary effects.
---
They're the sad, unloved robots, left behind by an owner who quit/hopped servers and forgot to bring their friend with them. Be kind to the robots, friends. They're just looking for their forever home.
---
You get the quest if you explore it's starting point, which is in the forest; starting the quest is something that really can't be avoided. 
---
   The scaling fix several releases ago makes it possible for lower levels to accomplish some of the early quest tasks in the mire and WS - learning where you can/can't go is part of the game.  
---
  Besides, having multiple quests active simultaniously almost guarantees accomplishing at least a couple of steps toward completing one mission or another  during each play session.
---
How in the hell did I miss that? Sorry!
---
Thank you, sir!
---
Heh, they can't just hop on over to nexus and buy the mod, that would be too easy.
---
Thank you so much, you changed my life today.
---
Thank you, Star-Paladin!
---
Can see it happening with the npc update.
---
I had to go back and spam it a few times before it worked.
---
I'd definitely agree with you on that one. I do wonder just how tricky it is though, since there have been addons for PC users to use loadouts for a while now.
---
You can also get the key at Mount Blair train-yard, without going through the process. Row of lockers, up in an elevated catwalk thing.
---
Rewards are account based. Why would you use your main?
---
It's not a bug, it's a *fEAtuRe*
---
you won't need to feed the hadmade much if you sneak attack stuff in the head with it (semi auto). and you'll get more 5.56 drops from mobs as you level up. 
---
I dont have much experience on hybrid builds like this, although I've planned to do one myself soon (bloodied one handed melee and pistols). it all depends, playing alone? in power armor? lone wanderer, starched genes, nerd rage or something else. got lots of options under S, blocker, incisor, martial artist etc. My hybrid is only going to take the first 10% of each weapon skill, gladiator and gunslinger and mix in a lot of survivability perks.
---
I thought the camp stuff was character-based and not account-based
---
It is a potentially valuable commodity because they can be useful as a source of weapons/armor to scrap for mods, ammo, plans, chems and as you rightly point out they weigh nothing.
---
There are precious few weightless items in the game that are of any value and you can potentially store a vast number of... probably 65535?
---
Apart from this and to an extent Mr Fuzzy Tokens nothing else comes to mind.
---
Even the tokens from Lode Baring weigh 0.1lbs each, almost like they were made of 'old' discarded bobby pins :P
---
But they haven't released any DLCs, all we've had so far are free updates and patches.   
---
Update = for everyone, needed to play, free  
---
DLC = optional, not needed to play, normally not free
---
To be clear, players aren't looking for Fixers. They're looking for Fixer plans and legendary Fixers. 
---
The Fixer grants improved stealth and faster movement in stealth. It reportedly does more damage than the combat rifle; which is already decent. I have yet to do enough testing to see if it outperforms a handmade. 
---
Legendary Fixers are hard to come by because they haven't been in the loot pool very long.
---
Unique stuff is mostly legendary weapons. Unique cosmetics are mostly Atom Store. But some like Nuka Cola Power Armor Skins are obtained in game. Some others in events like meet week. You can get atoms by completing challenges. There is little need to buy them. Patience and not blowing them. Consider what you get carefully. They are only cosmetic and may not work as expected. Always check here for posts from others who bought them.
---
Ad Victoriam
---
Ah, Gage. He's a great one! I really like Hancock, too. Same sort of smart ass remarks. :D
---
And check weekly for the free stuff.
---
If I could pick any three effects, I'd love these:
---
Quad, Bloodied, Explosive Double Barrel.
---
Quad, Bloodied, Explosive Harpoon.
---
Quad, Bloodied, Explosive the Dragon.
---
Quad, Bloodied, VATS cost 10mm pistol.
---
Quad, Bloodied, 50% Crit damage AssHead.
---
Quad, Bloodied, Explosive Laser Rifle.
---
Quad, Bloodied, Explosive Plasma Rifle.
---
Bloodied, Explosive, 10% more damage while aiming Fixer.
---
Bloodied, VATS Crit, VATS Cost fixer (the first possible roll on this list).
---
Bloodied, 10% while aiming, faster reload Fixer (another legit roll).
---
Bloodied, 2x faster reload 6-crank laser musket.
---
I'd rather a paid DLC and actually get something substantial than the content we've got so far that was funded by the atom shop. At least IMO the content released so far barley matches what we got in one of the smaller Fallout 4 DLCs, and at this point in 4's development they'd already released Nuka World, the final DLC. 
---
Basically you don't get shit with a live service and I'd rather the player base be split between modes/maps than just disappearing because we get an hour of new content every month if we're lucky.
---
i dont know tbh. and i dont remember his name. i may have accidently deleted him while cleaning my fl. today i realised that the only way for him to meet me was to join my world and fasttravel to me because we dont have a chat system for friends on pc. now the only way seems to be reddit, thats why i posted here.
---
I saw a group of random collectrons in the middle of nowhere. I figure they're plotting against us.
---
That might be true if we weren’t capable if literally going back to pre-beta on this very subreddit and seeing the repeated bitching about why it shouldn’t be made.
---
I suppose bugs do ensure devs having a job ;)
---
It's base damage is higher than a handmade, and .45 ammo weighs nothing with bandolier rank 2 while 5.56 weight .001 or something like that. and when people run around with 100,000+ rounds of ammo these days, that means a lot.
---
Upvote for sure! No reason why a holographic sight goes invisible. Its projecting it's own light which is not a part of the frame. 
---
However, I think it is due to the engine and the sight being a model on the gun. I think the only way this gets fixed is if they make the sight model not being effected by chameleon which would mean you would see a sight floating. Not a terrible thing but would draw complaints just the same.
---
No it doesn't
---
Hope springs eternal! Worst case, he never sees this. But if he does, awesome!!
---
I wouldn't need 8 INT? Then how much? And what perk(s) would I use in AGI?
---
Monorail elevator near fort defiance. Go all the way up and work through the tram. Many bags.
---
I hope you guys meet up in the wastes! Good luck!
---
I’ll be on tomorrow so I’ll send you a friend request then :)
---
Yeah, you can sell a known, but you can't sell the specific one you learned from. It is consumed upon learning. The (known) plans you sell is copies you get after you learned it.
---
True but who knows what the OP's base Charisma is?
---
Also, old habits die hard lol
---
Fair enough friend.
---
Yuppers
---
No, they're all Atom shop unlocks, so you can use them across all 5 characters under that account.
---
As a side bonus to making a NW specific character, my NW toon is lvl 110 in Adv, and has made 40k caps, without ever having been played in Adv.
---
I see you have rank 5 makeshift warrior, how quick does your weapon break?
---
I see them every now and then especially near Whitespringws but I don't see them 'everywhere'  and I really do not see where its a problem having them roam around.
---
I love that so many of us have random legendary shovels that we just keep. I thought it was amusing, so mine lives on a weapons display in my camp. I grab it before I head out towards Grafton, just in case.
---
well shit, I have been playing NW completely wrong. thanks for the information
---
Simply put, it does the highest damage per bullet of any silenced full auto rifle with equivalent legendary effects.
---
This means that it out damages a full auto handmade which was the previous king in this category.
---
When I grab the pylons I get destroyed. There needs to be an in-game explanation on how these events work. I'm sick of watching 40 minute YouTube videos every time I want to do somethung in game.
---
I like to believe they were wanting it to be a bit more role play-ey. It simply didn’t work. In reality you can’t take one of the deepest-dialogue game series ever and just drop it for an entirely new game. The people wanted co-op, not an MMO.... but it’s getting better. I like how the future is looking.
---
Do you have meat cleavers in your inventory? I know sometimes when loading in, the things I'm carrying can spawn in as a physical item that can't be picked up...like viable scorchbeast DNA, technical data, plans, toxic mutagenic waste, etc. I'm wondering if this is happening to you as well since it seems to come out of you and not the tree.
---
They really need to add a cool down timer that you can view in your Pip-Boy. I use all five of my characters, and trying to figure out if any of them can start dumping slag is driving me fucking nuts.
---
BETHESDA, you can do this, baby! I believe in you!
---
I have all of mine built in and around terrain features. I'll try to find some pictures. When I'm traveling I'll often try to see if I can place a camp just to see ;-)
---
* One is inside the monorail pylon near the elevator. I see other camps there, but rarely many actually up and inside. The challenge is getting high enough and ALSO getting the junk node.
---
* One I have on the lookout / park area north of the Bed &amp; Breakfast (on the road S of the Whitesprint). I've got it using tents and open-air kinda look and feel.
---
* One is inside / around an actual rest stop on the road near Huntersville. It's a rest stop, one lobby and 2 restrooms w/ a parking lot (and a nice bluff up behind it on a cliff).
---
* One I have around a drainage culvert, using it as a covert entrance (going under the bridge)
---
Other areas I've considered, but not yet done.
---
* There is a restroom up in the toxic valley, somewhat east of the lake w/ the toxic mutagenic waste.
---
* You can build in and around the houses south of Seneca Rocks Visitor Center.
---
* Lots of rail cars, but I like them level so things sit better.
---
* There are several under-the-road areas in the bog you can build.
---
From the hell to the yes!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I’ve seen it once or twice but I haven’t played in a few weeks.
---
Yeah for 1000 atoms 😂
---
Buy something from MODUS via pip boy and have it drop from space
---
BATTLE BOTS
---
My username is PBcolts23, feel free to add me!
---
&gt;Get all the resources going, unlocked, and start crating items
---
If you want to minimize the PvP potential from workshops, don't craft there;  in fact, spend as little time within the workshop boundaries as possible.  If you're going for fusion cores, drop a fast travel mat right in from of the fusion core processor and then fast travel back to your camp to do your crafting.  Every so often, fast travel back to the workshop to collect your cores.  The mat will make sure you're right at the processor where you can grab them and fast travel away in a matter of seconds.
---
As someone else mentioned, once you get to be a higher level, people will (for the most part) stop trying to claim your workshops.  Most of these "raiders" prey upon the weak and won't attempt PvP if there's a chance that they might come out on the wrong side of the fight.  So, between now and then, be the mouse that sneaks and scurries grain from the silos and know that someday you'll be the grizzly that no one messes with.
---
If you read what I wrote it's not just dailies that would run into issues with your proposed changes. The Berkley Springs workshop is currently primed for spawn camping, Berkeley and Bog Town's enclave events would be a mess cause they're set within the workshop zones, hoard events like to travel through workshop zones etc. 
---
I get that you don't like getting snuck up on in workshops due to the broken way attackers get all the advantage but your solution creates multiple issues. If instead there was some way owners in workshops could be notified when someone was encroaching on the workshops territory so they could be ready for a takeover attempt, or a couple of seconds delay between initiating a takeover and actually being able to PvP the workshop owner to encourage actual PvP vs cheap kills. Those changes might improve the overall experience without compromising multiple other quests and events.
---
Year 3 update lol
---
Alcohol as well is a must for melee junkies. It's super easy to farm (a few wheat plants) and has bearable side effects as well as a variety of options for benefits.
---
Script and venders just need to reset when dailies do.
---
There are two other vaults not open. And yeah, I’m sure they could unlock areas we cannot see right now to show people coming in or others moving in from out of the map.
---
Thank you! This is very helpful.
---
There isn't really anything left for me to do in the game anymore except to roll for the Fixer legendaries. But I can only roll for 1.5 a day.
---
It's as if Bethesda wants me to quit playing.
---
Pretty sure they talked about it in the e3 announcement
---
u/lmc80 Fallout missed connections.
---
Because it’s an online game and we are the NPCs lol. You would really prefer an ai companion over an actual player?
---
Yeah, I heard it used to be there.  However I checked all the lockers and it was not in any of them.  I think it was a mistake that they even it put it there in the first place, so the developers must have removed it.
---
I once found a corpse of a Deathclaw named "Travelling Merchant". Makes me think that people of Appalachia were actually shapeshifting reptiles but died out for some reason..
---
my brother got realy upset to hear the survival got removed &amp; private servers dont sound like no problem solver, its just gonna be a lame ass lan party.  does not have a taste for battle royale as it removed vats ( hes an older guy who did not play caunter strike back in the day) . fallout is the only game he plays, but now he wont.
---
They were working on 94 and 96 together and were originally planning to release them together but decided to hold of on releasing 96 so they could get feedback from 94 to find out what works and what doesn't. There hasn't been much talk of vault 63 at all. There were some data miners a few months back that had got a layout of 96 and showed it off and it seemed to have had a cryo lab and a creature lab
---
It actually does, because with handmades the second shot is also counted as first and procs like the first. That's how you'll do 2\*2k damage.
---
Yeah im in complete agreement. I like the look of the Wastelander update, cant wait to see how they implement these new characters.
---
Just the sneak added bonus. Basically can be a 4 star legendary.
---
Thanks! I'll have to check these out.
---
1. Let us fish from our porches, sitting if we prefer
---
2. Let us create ponds (camp item) to fish in if there's no local water
---
3. Let us catch special 'cosmetic' fish we can place in aquariums as a type of display case
---
4. Let us catch rare three-eyed mutant fish that can be used to make serums
---
I killed a level 12 the other day because they claimed the workshop. 
---
It’s part of the game
---
Glad to hear its not only me.  I can certainly go back and try it more times, or maybe even switch between servers to see if that makes any difference.
---
Yeas, if they can change way to pick them up (no animation showing the map) - transferring maps between characters is very time consuming...
---
I'd prefer not to get to the Top of The World and discover that Rose is a fucking Mr Gutsy.
---
I hope you are trollin' for your sake. There are a couple of ways a handmade beats it... Damage is not one of them.
---
It just really performs well if you get one with a decent legendary effect. I have an Executioner's Fixer,  and while I'm not even fully spec'd out for max damage, it was one- to two- shotting everything yesterday, especially once adrenaline kicked in. And if you've got a sneaky build like I do, the Fixer pushes that over the top. I mostly use an AAE handmade, but I'm definitely using the Fixer more and more.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but it feels like the Fixer takes less AP Per shot than a Handmade aswell.
---
How did you feel about it? That’s the real question.
---
My camp just south of Grafton also spawns the Viable SB DNA. But I can’t ever pick it up. Sometimes I also get Chem Station plans that I can’t pick up either.
---
Kill anyone dumb enough 2 take a workshop, kill em all
---
Np, it's a great tool!
---
No. Fish are dead
---
I saw someone killing the Lvl. 29, I felt so damn bad.
---
Will do!
---
People always say XB1 seems to have a more mean player base, but in my 1300+ hours, I haven't found this to personally be the case.  Everyone I've ever ran into who has been using a mic have been decent folks.
---
Snootchy boochies! 
---
Can I stand outside it all day?
---
Did you do the quest and learn about rose? Why does it matter what she looks like? If she was still alive, would that really matter? Her personality is exactly the same. What does her being human matter? Lol
---
I ignored that second half because there are clusters of spawn points all around those 2 zones for you to choose from, and I'm almost positive that none of them drop you directly into the workshop zone. You still have to walk into them but I'm not home to test it. Events also automatically make everyone on pacifist mode, which is how people did events on survival so that's not much a concern either. 
---
I don't care at all if people sneak up on my workshop. I'm tired or hearing other people complain about it. I think it's only fair that if I enter your workshop you should be able to initiate PvP the same way I can.
---
You're still coming back? You must be a Kevin. I am allowed to have concern over someone's well being and an anthropomorphized 15 minute Nickelback song like you isn't going to stop me from doing so. You came here with a pedantic opinion, didn't bother sharing a story, and for what reason exactly good ol' Kevin? Not enough attention from your parents? Sounds like a you problem
---
Not my cup of tea either. As everyone else that’s gonna comment here though; it is all part of the game.
---
You should have out-conspiracied him.  "Oh, you believe in the earth?  That's cute.  It's all a simulation, moron!"
---
Moral? Yes.
---
Nice? No.
---
My normal rule is that if both are lvl 50+ anything goes in workshops. If I feel like PvP I might engage, do a bit of fighting then give a salute and let them have it. No long engagement, don't want to eat up too much of a fellow players time in case they need stuff from the workshop and have to log soon. Just a few short rounds of PvP, a nice salute and off I go, sometimes leaving a gift if I have a lot of what they seem to be extracting from the workshop.
---
Yeah thats a great idea, id love a wilderness area, maybe it could be like the glowing sea from fallout 4?
---
I did like it to complete the challenge, but never touched them again. Loot was terrible.
---
It's a dick move, but you'll find plenty who justify it for one reason or another.
---
[According to Bethesda](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more?) people are tired of cosmetic-only "micro"-transactions, and have been asking them for the ability to pay for *"items with real utility"*.
---
Those must be the people who keep asking if it's "good yet".  They're desperate to play a pay-to-win game and they keep asking if Bethesda has implemented that yet.
---
That hasn't been my experience. If I leave it long enough it seems like it holds about 15 items.
---
Fair point, but some dialogue options wouldn't have gone amiss.
---
Or maybe they should just have a clock on the vendors that shows when their stock/caps get replenished each day from the first time you make a transaction.
---
Ahhh thank you for the clarity.
---
I have combat armor with poison resistance.
---
Do you play on PC? I do, and started with FO3. I had never played ANY shooter before, so my husband modded my game for the 'god gun'- one hit kills on everything. He set me up with lots of ammo, and it was great! For about an hour and a half. What was the point of looting when I had the best gun? What was the point of leveling up if I could already one-hit-kill every single thing on the map? I finished the main story and never went back. All I remember is wondering what the point was.
---
Enter New Vegas. Having played 3, I did it properly. I found guns and gear. I leveled up to use what I found. I had to choose perks carefully so that I didn't waste them on some QoL perk when I REALLY needed my gun to do a LOT more damage. And you know what? When I beat it, I played it again.
---
I understand where you're coming from. I can see the appeal of having a level one railway rifle as soon as you walk out of the vault. But the grind of finding better and better equipment is half of the fun. I promise.
---
tl;dr ... The game is not half as much fun when you have god tier weapons and armor when you start off.
---
I think they had and are still having problems with instancing tech or something similar that does not involve lore.
---
Well it's a wild wasteland afterall...  Think of it like a more experienced raider picking on a fresh outta vault dweller. Players in fallout76 were supposed to be the Npc's and create various interactions between each other. So I'd say you got killed by a mean bully raider but there's nothing wrong with it, since it's the part of the gameplay. Is it moral ? Probably not, but the  personality of that person who killed you reflects in his actions.
---
To your first question, wuick bursts can avoid most of the recoil al lot of the guns have. 2nd option is to aim low (at their feet), and let the recoil bring your aim up to finish with a headshot. It's about the only way I can down someone in a single burst with the rad rifle, or SMG.
---
I run full agressive perks, with 1 slot for utility, master commando for 30% dmg boost to auto rifles, tank killer for 40% armor pen., tenderizer for 20% dmg buff, and bloody mess for additional 15% dmg. I also run Pharma farma for med-x and psycho. Keep a med-x up at all times for the 50 DR, and pop a psycho when you know an engagement is eminent.
---
Learn the locations of magazines and bobbleheads. The games I can get a small gun bobblehead (+30% dmg), and a +10% dmg to other players magazine, and I'm insta-killing anyone I fire at. Throw in a stealth boy, and you'll be wiping teams.
---
Yes. That was a change and took a little getting used to. We are getting that in wastelanders.
---
And lets have that with a side of “Now 500 daily scrip limit”
---
Yes and no yes because they’re in known risk of PvP being initiated against them (The warning you get saying Other players may initiate PvP when you claim a wshop) and No because I morally think is wrong to kill anyone under level 50 but that’s just me
---
Probably not until the patch Wednesday unfortunately.
---
Oh boy whadda huge amount of questions! Sure proves your point!
---
Couldn’t have put it better myself-trying to hit someone who is regular jumping is hard enough, not to mention being one or two shotted by someone who can jump five times as high.
---
I didnt realize there were so many damage boosting perks in the game. Seems I need to do some leveling!  That answers my question.
---
Should make it like WoW's Blingtrons.  When ever scavenger bots encounter each other, they fight to the death and winner gets the junk the other bot was carrying.
---
  Thats how I got my first SB - didnt know there was a fissure nearby. I had Just made L50, headed toward the pumpkin house.  Ducked into hopewell cave.  ...  suprised by its reisdent.... when walked out, SB.
---
Ended up being a trial by fire - before I got to the pumpkin house front porch, had taken out 4 of them.
---
Plasma Caster, Gauss Gatling Gun, Gauss Shotgun, Gauss pistol.  
---
One Legendary Gauss Gatling gun and Plasma Caster please.
---
Act anyone who actualy paid any attention to anything tod howard said along with bethesda. Fallout76 is not ment to be a PvP based game. Yes there will be minor drama along the way. You see what happened when greafers took the field in 76. Bethesda quickly changed things so players were not forced into Pvp interaction and now homes/ camps cant be harmed.
---
Wholesome
---
Lol "upvote with alts" sorry dumbass, I don't need any alt accounts for upvotes, admnd oh shit! One email address, fancy that. You happen to be the asshole here, and not once was I seeking validation from mouth breathing, mountain dew guzzling, basement dwelling weeb wannabes. I asked for other weird stories, and judging by the upvotes, and your downvoted, deleted comments, no one wanted your opinions either. Now run on home before you give yourself atrial fibrillation because you're angry that I think your opinion is as valid as an expired bread loaf coupon. Fucking Americans, can't follow instructions. 
---
Just my take though 😁
---
My guess is that since nuking Appalachia is part of the canon they didn't want to force people to do it when there are humans in the area. I mean, it's not like we haven't nuked people in a Fallout game before, but at least then it was a choice.
---
Like it was said above - the only thing Luck raises is the durability bar for found items - it doesn't affect loot quality...
---
Like for like with mods then yes (mods make quite a big difference).
---
Perforating on the fixer and Stinging on the handmade workout about the same.
---
I would kill a lv 5 and take all there junk
---
?
---
Was it on PS4? I'm level 49and took Grafton Steel in a nuke zone from a high level player. 5 minutes later my camp got nuked and it's not normally an area that gets nuked. I'm wondering if it was coincidences or redemption.
---
🦀🦀$11🦀🦀

This^^
---
Well, there has been sentient nice mannered Deathclaws in the fallout games before:  
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Goris](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Goris) 
---
However, that one has been confirmed to be a bug.
---
They need to fix Error CE-34878-0 aka Bluescreen
---
If anyone on xbox wants to play i pretty much don't know anyone who plays it and im up for team-ups if you also don't have anyone and want to play, my english isnt perfect orally but i get by, i can also speak in spanish or French if english isnt your mother language either...
---
Keep it. Wastelanders wil be out soon enough.
---
From what I you are saying, I hear; you put in the work to locate this good weapon, but don’t deserve to use it.
---
Why should I not be able to use a weapon after working to find it?
---
And it was memorable and fun, and you know not to wander around that area now unless you're looking to box some SB.
---
I'm lvl 20 and had a lvl 355 try and take the ammo factory yesterday..... He failed but tried
---
&gt;You're still coming back? You must be a Kevin. I am allowed to have concern over someone's well being and an anthropomorphized 15 minute Nickelback song like you isn't going to stop me from doing so. You came here with a pedantic opinion, didn't bother sharing a story, and for what reason exactly good ol' Kevin? Not enough attention from your parents? Sounds like a you problem
---
Read this back to yourself again and tell me what you've just said isn't embarrassing and pathetic.
---
Well, they should make the game not suck and fix shit been broken since beta
---
Ive heard that it out dmgs the handmade
---
*Crabrave*
---
I don't even know what this means.
---
not really what i was going for tbh
---
As if blazarquazar over here deleted a bunch of his comments, comment threads he started I might add, and think I have over 80 alternate accounts for upvotes. Guy is just as crazy as that flatearther and about as smart lmfao. What a living joke
---
I prefer automatics, as they fit well with my run&amp;gun playstyle. You can just as easily add/swap master rifleman for sneak/sniper play, or some of the heavy weapon equivalents in. There are lots of valid options. 
---
All NW rewards are account based, so you can benefit from making a NW specific character, so you don't have to bork your stats in Adv.
---
I’m thinking I’ll go that way.
---
I’d kill you and teach you how to spell
---
I was going to say “prove it”, but actually, don’t.
---
better than nothing i guess
---
I had someone try to claim a workshop from me. They messaged me while still being contested, said they just needed to claim it to complete a quest, and that I can claim it back when they are done. And that is exactly how everything played out.
---
I plan on playing in power armor once I get decent gear (I’m missing the left arm, torso and left leg to complete my T-45 armor set) I definitely play more often by myself than anything else so I do use the lone wanderer perk and I have a couple other specific perks in mind to bolster this build as I level up and unlock them
---
I rarely visit the interior of Whitesprings or the bunker for this reason. I always get lost in those corridors and hate all the load screens. I've memorized the way to get to the control room, but if I see nuke cards in player vendors, I always buy them to avoid the hassle.
---
Yes, it was on PS4. Saw someone, not the victim nor the killer.
---
What is the benefit of a Private server?  F076 is basically my 1st online game that I've committed to... So go easy on the salty responses.
---
Definitely should, would love to see something like the fishing mechanic in RDO, or at least something more simple
---
I like the perk for mobility, but hate I for combat. I feel like I'm playing old-school Unreal or something with everyone constant bunny hopping. I now am on the please remove it train.
---
I don't mind losing some junk, even lots of it, I'm just pissed that I've lost everything I've been storing since starting the game.
---
And yet they call Wild Appalachia and Nuclear Winter DLCs. We have DLC roadmaps for them. Sure, you can argue semantics, but it is what they were called. Again, google is your friend.
---
The difficulty option would be really nice. So little of the game is useful for high level characters now.
---
You mean how you were murdered by words Nancy? Yeah the only one who should be embarrassed here is you kid. You came to act like a brat, got treated like one and now you're pissed off because someone can stand up to you. Your lack of listening skills is astounding, but expected.
---
And that is why i always check the Armor tab of Vendors. Hasnt payed off yet but it might.
---
Some people are so desperate for this to be just another single player bethesda RP
---
Others have issues with griefers they hope this will solve
---
And yet others are assuming eventually they will be able to mod these servers just like they did previous single player titles which I sincerely doubt.
---
Trade it for a gun u want. I doubt Gamma gun would be then a Bloodied FFr handmade when wastelanders since the rad dmg is fixed
---
do we need a "r/missedconnections76"?
---
Its an easily missed trap.  Setting off or disabling traps in an owned workshop gives the wanted status.
---
I'm not sure what you mean thy this (I'm assuming it's a bug but I'm still interested).
---
Can you please explain this step by step for me? I have a a junkies fixer and a junkies handmade so should be able to confirm :)
---
I hope u can disable pacifist and make a PvP sever or host free for alls
---
Sure which platform?
---
Omg, dude, I’m not the one who’s angry. Have you read your posts? I’m honestly astonished at the emotion in your responses. I’m all done here but I hope you have a good gaming experience in the future￼. ￼I’m sorry that my country of birth offends you￼ so deeply, I haven’t been proud of it myself since Nov 2016. Maybe eat some good food, smoke some weed, or do whatever the fuck makes you feel happy but I’m done arguing about nonsense and truly hope that you feel better.

Scrip it. 50% discount now so you can try to have another good 3* instead this trash.

I try not to sink to their level, being that most who act like this are most definitely severely mentally ill. Biffnutticus over here and blazarquazar seem to think that even though they weren't there, both of their very different and idiotic judgements are what happened. Like seriously how moronic can some people get? People don't scream about killing your family for not answering a question in a video game unless they are mentally unstable
---
Bethesda has already confirmed mods will come. Multiple times. Including in the announcement last week. So it's not an assumption. ;)
---
Just contest workshops or stalk people
---
Everyone in our part of it are either dead or fled the scorched. The fresh bodies are just people who didn't know better trying to pass through.
---
Good point. It’s running almost 400 dmg on my bloodied build, but I’ve got a bloodied handmade so what’s the point really?
---
Guess its time to start a secondary Character for Nuclear Winter. If i start with a Level 2 character how does that work with Special points? Do i have to load into adventure to level up and assign special points or is there a way to do that directly in NW? Haven't played much only enough to unlock the special Morgantown items.
---
I certainly hope the "mods" will be regulated and wont affect drop or exp rate, unless they significantly boost difficulty.
---
Hey all, we're aware of this and you should be able to apply the gold paint to The Action Hero in a future patch. This didn't make it in time for Patch 14 on Wednesday, but it's coming. Thanks for the report!
---
Future comment if this was implemented,  "I was in the middle of X and the game transferred me to NW. We need some type of system to allow us to finish X before being transferred to NW."
---
Hi! We have a fix for this in Patch 14 on Wednesday.

I've got an awesome closeup of a flatwoods monster up the hill from ws, I like this more lol

Why? We're ppl crying over their bases being destroyed?

But they don't, they call them updates. We have update roadmaps for them. Again Google is your friend.
---
Or go to the fallout site and look at how many updates they have announced and notice not one DLC

Usually people are friendly in this game and if a workshop is taken, they won't bother fight you to claim it. Sometimes i get approached by players who are leaving the game and want me to take the workshop. I've done the same.
---
Recently, i've started to see more "griefy" attitude among players. Damn i got bullied by two 200+ level guys at Whitespring for no reason. I'm level 115 btw. F\*ck you madrobotz or wtv your name was.
---
I guess having less and less to do is rendering people more pvp oriented. I suspect NW also contributed to it.
---
Yup. And then barely anyone played survival, so that was gone.
---
Hmmm. Less than 3lbs though. I might hold on to it instead. If I ever hit my head, I might start PVP’ing.
---
Thanks for the feedback on this. I'll bring it up with the team and see if there are any plans for this. Thanks!
---
Oh no you seem to mistake vulgarity for emotion. Yeah that's not how I work, see I could be smiling this entire time and you wouldn't know it, but please go on about how I have over 80 alternate reddit accounts for upvotes. That's about as physically credible as jesus coming back from the dead. Do you need a slow clap on your way out?

Ahh. Was not aware of that

I found one just floating above a lake yesterday
---
You will need to log into Adv. to allocate SPECIAL points, there isn't an option yet to do it in the vault lobby. Nukes &amp; Dragons has a pretty good addendum to their FO76 build planner for NW perks and stats, it's worth checking out if you want to plan ahead, or see what perks there are. There isn't always a lot of time in the lobby to check out new perks, or make changes to your build.
---
Funny thing is, this is taken with ingame camera. I was trying to sneak up on him, but he spotted me and teleported right behind me. I've turned around and took exactly this one picture :D
---
Probably be happier playing a dedicated PvP game.
---
Thanks for the feedback! I brought up the ability to grow pumpkins with the team last week. Will let you know if we have any updates to share on this!
---
A medics fat man and a junkies rolling pin. :P Honestly though, more junk than I could scrip (so I'm now encumbered until next refresh), zero useful armor, a few items to sell and an executioners faster swing speed pickaxe.
---
Story wise, it makes sense.  But I do wish there was maybe a random human or intelligent ghoul(s) hidden somewhere on the map.  I'd be willing to bet they just didn't have the dialogue trees built at all within the F76 engine.

This is my bloodied melee build. I wear a full set of Unyielding armor, +15 to all specials almost doubles your melee damage. For nuke zones, I drop iron fist and martial artist, and add all 3 slugger perks with 2 points in each. Your death claw gauntlet wont work in power armor. But to deal the most damage, trade that junkies dcg in for a bloodied dcg. If youre going to be at low health anyways, you may as well get the most from it.
---
Strength, 
---
the only thing I changed is Traveling pharmacy for Blocker. Blocker is is a huge defence perk, and especially when youre up close with a melee build. 
---
Perception 
---
Not that important to keep 3 points here, but I personally do so that I can open all locks, and use glow sights for when im in nuke zones. 
---
Endurance 
---
5 points into Ironclad is a lot for 50 dr and er. Instead, add extra points into Agility for Evasive. With some unyielding armor you will max out the er and dr from that perk at 45 with only 3 points instead of 5. Plus, with a low health build, the agility is more important than the endurance. Radicool is a must for any low health melee build, as +5 strength will add a lot of damage. Dense armor and fireproof will make you nearly immune to explosions, one of the top killers to low health builds. 
---
Charisma
---
Playing alone, lone wanderer gives a lot of extra help. If you dont want 3 points in perception, I would add the other 2 here for party boy/girl. You can get some extra strength from alcohol, and this perk will double it. 
---
Intelligence 
---
Keep this at 5 so that you can repair and build mods for whatever your needs. Nerd rage is the only real important perk here for a low health build, but you shouldnt need more than 5. 
---
Agility 
---
Already talked about Evasive. Action boy/girl so you can keep the power attacks up. Adrenaline for the obvious 60% damage increase. Just keep killing and dont stop!
---
Luck
---
Serendipity is arguably the most important perk of all for low health builds. With high luck it will trigger more than half the time you take damage, saving you from all damage. Starched genes and class freak so you can have all the mutations with basically none of the side effects. Bloody mess for extra damage, and mysterious saviour for those times when the extra er and dr from barbarian and evasive just aren’t enough.
---
And who are you to tell him how to enjoy his game shame on you!

Probably the main benefit right now is increased server stability. I regularly have 20+ people on my servers and you can see the difference in lag and DCs when they're high level players dropping nukes and farming tons of mobs, vs. being on a server with like 10 lower level players.
---
Another benefit could be increased building budget for camps. The current budget is so restricted because it impacts performance, so reducing the number of concurrent players from 20+ to 3-4 would allow us the extra performance boost to build more-- and maybe even build adjacent camps with friends.
---
Related to that, if private servers are persistent (meaning we always return to the same server), players would be able to build up workshops as additional camps around the world. Right now if you leave a world (through choice or DC) you're usually assigned a new world when you log back in, so everything you built in workshops is gone.
---
Private servers would also reduce competition for scavenging out in the world. Sometimes people will want items that spawn in a certain location, but arrive to realize that all the loot is gone because someone is farming it or just finished scavenging the place. Basically, we wouldn't have to server hop, which I personally find immersion breaking and kind of cheesy.
---
They would also be a bit harder than public servers, since you wouldn't necessarily drop a nuke and have a bunch of people rush to farm it. Also, the addition of player vendors is awesome but it does also reduce difficulty, as I've been to many player camps that are giving away free crops, free water, and potentially dirt cheap equipment and medicine and such.
---
And finally, in the long run private servers will give us the ability to mod our experience, which isn't something you can do on public servers (since everyone would need to run the same mods to make the experience unified). Mods aren't available yet but they may be the most important part of private servers in the long run.
---
As you can see, there are many reasons to enjoy private servers!
---
It isn't trash its actually very good
---
Either you or someone you are teamed with have pacifist mode turned off.  Or, there is a wanted player and you or someone on you team hit them and they hit back starting PVP.
---
I don't like people who enjoy the game at a cost of destroying it for others...
---
Sup Ham and agreed
---
Btw, if you want to be wanted again, find locked player doors and pick them. Someone will complain but it puts you on the map and someone might show up.
---
I didn’t even read your response. I think you are emotionally unstable. I’m reporting you.
---
Depends on your gear, if you can kill them basically in one second/shot then no, otherwise fair game
---
This would be awesome! Thanks for the suggestion, I'll bring it up with the team today.
---
Yes, it is moral. I love going to workshops and killing people so much fun.
---
When did I ever say I felt threatened you giant idiot? I said concerned for his mental health. That's a completely different story and if your idiot ass was right in front of me trying to put words in my mouth I'd smack what teeth you have left into the back of your throat so that your next customer gets a gum job.
---
Then you shouldn’t be playing a M Rated game my guy or buy your own private server.
---
It was for free at launch
---
I really like fo76 lore :)
---
Still, lockpicking became kinda useless. Most people just lock their room just cuz it's cool but if there's nothing to break it's pointless
---
Mods won't come for a bit, but when they do, they will almost definitely be customizable like previous Fallout games. There's no need for regulation in that kind of situation, as you can make the game as hard or easy as you like (I will personally mod it to be super hard survival mode, cause I love that!)

---
 &gt; This would be awesome! Thanks for the suggestion, I'll bring it up with the team today.

So that's why you removed your comments, didn't want to be reported. Sorry but only children report people lol
---
That’s weird considering that you’re all supposed to be teamed when joining the quest.
---
If your STR is lower or you're further away, that'll drop your damage on a heavy weapon.
---
This is Fallout. That's the whole point, survive and if I wanna be a raider just let me be, get good
---
I would expect each server would probably have its own instance of the player. I would personally enjoy a level free server where you start at 50 and get all the perks you want. 
---
Or maybe bring back a fallout 4 style perk tree. 
---
Main reason? Have the entire map be like the cranberry bog, only you don't start with good equipment.
---
Most players can coexists and play "nice", so no wonder those who acts as dickheads are not liked.
---
What about character transition between modded private server and adventure mode?
---
Hey all, thanks for the reports on this. We're working on a fix for those poor abandoned Collectrons. I don't have a timeframe to share just yet but we'll let you know once the fix is ready to roll out.
---
Sure, be what you want, but I like changes they've done to Adventure to make life of griefers harder ;)
---
Its why I always say ESO is basically the more successful sister to this game, had a rough childhood but quickly turned her life around and is now adored by everyone while her brother is still living on the couch.

Sounds cool but I'd personally prefer if it didn't fire a hail of radiation bolts like a rapid fire gamma gun. Instead I'd love to see a continuous beam of radiation, or maybe like a flamer except it irradiates.
---
Yep, to the right person it would be awesome.
---
ZeroOmegaZX on PC add me!
---
Don’t worry... that guy’s a Tool. Eh ehh. Am I right?
---
I only lock my house because people leave the damn doors open and it drives me nuts lol.
---
It's playing as a raider, and that's what Todd announced. I guess he just didn't jeep his promises
---
I've always done it, but I've never hit the 150 max and then went back until this weekend.
---
Or just make it a global timer so we all know when it will reset.
---
Not the first time, I guess ;) And probably not the last time either...
---
Like I said, the parent comments were deleted. A.k.a. your inappropriate comments were deleted. I didn’t think they were necessary without any context. I’m blocking you now. Good day
---
That and Cranberries considering Thanksgiving is coming up as well.
---
hmm, ok, maybe I need to get up in her face more. Normally a rifle guy so it's not natural to me. Thanks!
---
Or, when you take the workshop, build a stash box, stash all your junk and build while crouching. If someone comes and takes you out, go somewhere else for a while and wait for them to server hop (most PvP players aren't in it for the loot and just go looking for targets) and then go back and retake the workshop. Also, if you want fusion cores, just memorize the power armor locations in easy areas and make a route to farm them.
---
Just out of curiosity, which vendor was on duty at the Whitespring Station?  Was it the "normal" lvl38 one or the "off-hours" lvl5 one?
---
Wait the cheese as in the bruhhhhhhhhhhh
---
I have a suggestion for a fix sir. Just hear me out, I understand you are a busy person so I’ll get right to it.
---
You know what an elephant graveyard is? I will assume this do. So all these left over electrons should be set to walk to one location after the owner leaves. Once they arrive at this location they die. That big sink hole in the mire would be a good spot. Just let them walk off and plummet to their deaths.
---
Define griefing, because right now you sure sound like you’re one of those people that sit defending workshops 24/7 with a Food Build then complain why their Asassins Explosive Handmade isn’t even moving a pixel in my health lol.
---
What a coward lol. Go on and run away like you planned, and no none of my comments were deleted, all still there chump. Please please block me you irrelevant single celled organism.
---
Doesn’t like exploration 
---
Plays a franchise where exploration is a key component
---
I think I see the issue here
---
Good suggestion, I'll pass it along to the team. Thanks!
---
Whatever you say.  And my name isn't Nancy by the way.
---
I would recommended playing around with the F76 perk planner on nukesanddragons, never hurts to have a semi-solid plan on your perk progression. I just picked stuff on my first character without a plan and that toon was a mess.
---
I am on PC too, if you ever need some mods on that T45, or some combat armor modded with BOS etc. give me a call :-)
---
If I thought a nuke strike on Grafton would silence the Mayor, I'd try it solo . . .
---
That's hot
---
Level 400 here, your advice is shit. Don’t hate the player hate the game.

praise the sun

---
 &gt; Good suggestion, I'll pass it along to the team. Thanks!
---
hmmm.  I take that to mean your playstyle is more linear - one quest at a time.
---
Nothing wrong with that, either.
---
I enjoy battle royale but it is far from the same experience survival provided since battle royale is all about killing others while survival is about adventuring, surviving and engaging in unexpected pvp
---
Who or what do you suppose are in all those semi-trailers you can't open?
---
Yeah I personally just wish it was on a set global schedule...I know technically the current system can be used to greater benefit for the most dedicated (20 hours instead of 24), but as someone just checking in when I can it is really annoying not being able to just definitively know when it resets and not being able to look it up like I can for every other game. :/
---
For me griefing is keep killing one person (on trying to do so) without reason, to entertain yourself. And I'm not talking about workshops - I don't claim workshops at all (well, only when there is a challenge that require to do so) and people who moan about being attacked after this are guilty not reading what it's written upon claiming.
---
I don't care about what your name his, hence using whatever name I feel fits your situation at the time, Horatio Cornblower
---
I'm not a raider myself, but removing the threat of other players did make the game softer.  Especially for a nuclear wasteland.
---
The way they float in mid-air makes me think they are ghosts of the many robots I killed haunting me
---
The thing with the gauss is that even though you have to charge it, if it does a large output of damage anyways, you can simply tap the right trigger and kill the enemy in one shot
---
People can leave the event to get out of the temporary team and then they can attack. This was a common trick on survival.
---
Why is explosive rifle that good? Its just 25 extra explosive dmg per shot or am I missing something?
---
That is the big gay.
---
Well, I hoped that in time F76 would become more F4 and I'm happy with changes.
---
I was server hopping Berkeley Springs as I was replying to you earlier and while I haven't tested everywhere it seems that if you exit/crash within the town area it loads you back in within the workshop zone. It puts you in the middle of the street facing the door of the building you go up through to reach the workbench. 
---
I played survival too and events were only pacifist for those who chose to remain as participants.
---
Yes! I guess if it is not in the pod when we log out it gets left behind. Poor thing.
---
Oooh, and cap stashes too!
---
Then speed is the main synergy of explosive mod.
---
You can buy the idle pose of when you have your fists out for 150 atoms in photo mode though
---
Yes. Do it and be part of the hated raider community in this game.
---
Does this gun have a 250 DR while reloading legendary effect? That breaks the primary effect, Hunter's in this case. Otherwise the SBQ is an animal still and Hunter's should work.
---
If raider roleplayers actually did some roleplay besides some Hulk Smash shit they'd be much more welcome in my opinion.
---
Take inspiration from some Fallout 4 quests involving raiders for example. Build roadblock camps and ask for a toll, or try throwing a request and a threat or two before starting shooting at workshops. Create intricated labyrinth death trap camps and ask for a reward to let people out before they die, stuff like that.
---
Hell, the Mr. Bandit random encounter is a more entertaining raider than most of you guys.
---
Because people kept pushing Bethesda for a new fallout game every few years and they literally can't make them that fast is my guess. That's why i feel fallout 4 got the build it yourself aspect too because for a solid year every bethesda post was flooded with fallout 4 comments
---
This... there's a lot of institutional knowledge in the game and the breadcrumbs that come on the load screen are too infrequent to be useful to new players.
---
I don't wonder if many of the folks hopping to the event are new and haven't even done the lead up content
---
I used to do that cause for whatever reason some vendors overcharge or charge full price for USED items. I’d leave them spoiled stuff and give them a thumbs down to show their prices suck. For my shop, if it’s used, it’s heavily discounted cause it’s USED. I never charge full price for anything. But I mentioned leaving the bag of spoiled stuff thing on another thread some time ago and got ripped a new one. Then was also told that leaving the spoiled stuff just give them the chance to make fertilizer and then they can use it to plant stuff. So really I was *helping* them. I since then stopped doing that and realize that by not buying anything from vendors may deliver the message.
---
Good thought but, no, it's only two stars.
---
Gatling Drill - rotating "bits" of fury!
---
must say I prefer the handmade as a solid allrounder. good for sniping, and good for spitting out lead fast when the ghouls come runnin'. The gauss is great but the charging lag is a problem for me. hunting rifle and lever action are great too.
---
By raider I mean some sort of mafia but yeah. There'd be no point in smashing your camp... After all I do t gain anything. Although I could destroy it if they refuse to pay up
---
From a builder and social perspective, the game has been making good advances.  From a combat and general threat outlook, it's extremely lacking however.  Hopefully they'll reach a good balance down the road.
---
It’s interesting how different people play this game in different ways. I play it to relax. Not be on edge. That said, I have been trying to do hunter hunter. But sadly very few people like to play it.
---
I absolutely LOVE my BE lever action. 
---
It's quick, efficient, has a great atom shop skin and it 1 taps most anything in my way.
---
You can use it, once you reach the level to use it. Pretty simple and straight forward.  If it’s that good of a weapon put it in your stash like a normal person and once you hit the level requirement then bam 💥 you can use it
---
The DNA is in your inventory for a quest and is an old bug. Never seen the cleaver tree before, lol
---
Assuming that's allowed, I imagine it'll be up to the player(s) involved. For example, I would want a hardmode experience and thus would only invite players to my server who are willing to start fresh, whereas other players may not care about balance and create an 'open house' type server.
---
Agreed, still not all people who PvP are griefers and that’s a fact.
---
my explosive flechette harpoon gun would be an amazing fishing tool
---
Exactly
---
That's how I feel too, he's got a good sense of humor and it kinda sets the mood for my play style.
---
It's a jeep thing, you wouldn't understand
---
The bundle it was included in, ended on 10/7. They haven't reissued any of the special "bundle items" so far.
---
That's where I am. I just transitioned to a bloodied build yesterday after getting a regular bloodied handmade with +10% damage while aiming, and it does like 300 damage a shot already. But I'm not sure how much damage a lever action would have in the same situation, or a gauss, because i havent found either. The handmade is really nice and snappy, but I dont know if the others are just better or something.
---
Ahh it has been a hot minute and I am getting old.
---
I want to catch a three eyed fish and name him Blinky.
---
It tastes like chicken.
---
This is why lots stay in Passive so they dont receive cross fire. I strike over 15 peeps at every SBQ fight with my 3* tessla rifle but since i stay in passive no one gets harmed.
---
Would u mind telling me how much damage it does at 20% hp? I used to rock the lever, but idk how much damage it does with bloodied explosive at low hp
---
Yeah. I think it would bug me a bit though.
---
I have. I also like the idea of them 'breaking down'.
---
Thats a tough one, i personally leave players alone when they claim workshops and just server hop til i find the workshop i wanted unclaime. As for it being a low level, well thats tricky, im not saying i do this  but i know players who use low level players to claim workshops just to lure players in to kill them when they try to take it from the low level player and i know it works. So just be careful when u do sometimes its just easier to hop then to get wrecked over a workshop or worse risk getting ur base wrecked.
---
Or, do some personal management of your own and keep track of your actions. Or do u want Bethesda to wipe your ass also after taking a shit?
---
If you've never brought a power plant back online before, you're likely to get windmill or large generator plans your first time, rather than fusion reactor. You might need to do it a few times.
---
Haha, I find them floating in the air or walking over cliffs defying gravity!
---
Put the bones in the grave, and a shovel spawns on the other side of the nearby tree.  That's how it works for me.    
---
OTH, you have found a solution to an annoyance.
---
Yeah just keep pacifist on all the time, otherwise be very careful with your shots.  
---
That said if you're me and you're off after a wanted player....don't forget to turn it off...
---
I use em for mats collection... i normally run the whole of 1 area a day by walking between them...
---
Ive gone through hundreds of maps... mostly junk from it really.
---
Happy to buy more maps but at 50 a map its still a costly exercise to buy more... i have a had a few donations which was a nice treat!!
---
A one star bloodied handmade with powerful automatic receiver and all commando perks will give you a first class rifle.  Put a reflex sight on it to maximize your AP if vats is important to you.  The explosive affect is ok but not needed...it may increase the wear rate.

For my rifle builds I alternate between an Instigating Lever Action and a bloodied auto handmade.  This is just what I’ve settled into after trying many rifles.  Not to say others have no value.  In fact, a bloodied The Fixer is rather popular these days....it just suffers from a lot of kick that the handmade doesn’t have.
---
I have a 1* bloodied lever that does upper 600 in nerd rage.
---
I have mine at location 1. it has an amazing view where I can see both the bog and the mire. I can see the robco factory and the nukes being dropped at fissure prime.
---
Explosive Legendary is 20% of weapon damage, 32% with demo 5. so if the weapon does 200 it would be +64 explosive damage
---
4:30 pm or Am?
---
But that’s the problem. Why do I need to put this 10-20 pound weapon that I likely won’t use for a week or two into a stash that already has 700 pounds used up for the essentials. 
---
If I had enough room to hold onto it until I could use it, then I might lean a bit onto your side, but I just don’t. 400 pounds are used up on junk, another 200 for meds, and 100 on essential weapons and armor.
---
Arktos has a nice big parking lot.
---
How is a subreddit interfering with the design/development of an AAA publisher's game? I genuinely don't get it, so please explain it to me.
---
Vanguard and Bolstering are legendary effects so only come on items dropped by Legendary creatures.  
---
Polished can be learnt by scrapping metal armour types - its one of harder ones to get if i recall. I'm on PC otherwise i'd by happy to upgrade your metal armour \[legendary or otherwise\]
---
She’s a beaut, ain’t she?
---
... That was meant to sound like I’m talking about an object/structure, not an actual person. I’m not flirting with a video game.
---
No, but it is an assumption that you'll be able to do whatever and add whatever you want with mods.
---
It's an assumption to assume no restrictions.
---
I have ran lever, handmade, gauss, and hunting.  Of the four, I prefer the handmade right now.  I have been trying to get a fixer, but haven't been able to claim one yet.  That second, third, and so on shot ability really is the difference with mobs and higher lvl creatures.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if wastelanders comes with a steam release. That would help the player base.
---
I want some silt bean planters. Gotta make me some appalachili on a regular basis.
---
Kinda a dickhead move
---
There's gotta be some free staters left
---
Do you have a power armor frame? If not you need to place one down near the station then you can build parts to put on the frame. Hope this helps! 💕
---
Do you have a chassis in the station?
---
I think it was mistake to remove survival - most people who enjoy killing each other were there, while those like me, not interested in PvP were on adventure. Now those 'raider' lost their playground and I kind of understand their frustration...
---
I've done the event successfully many times (30 white wolf fedoras and sheep mascot outfits in my stash) and got it twice. Seems like about 1/20 chance?
---
I think it'd be nice if they did it like so:
---
\-Basic model achievable in-game like backpacks
---
\-Skins for sale.....but if you buy a skin and don't have the in-game item, you still get full access for it through purchase, item is still priced like a skin
---
\-Like backpacks, maybe have some mods/variations to utility that are in-game only? Increased % degradation prevention maybe?
---
As is I'm just sitting on Atoms waiting for the fridge skin I'd like because its nearly useless to me as a utility and I definitely don't intend to spend on more than one at the current price point. :(
---
Also ffs please release appliances that don't look fucking broken! The fridge door and the oven door on the stove being ajar and janky makes me so mad and its the only reason I don't have the red stove. &gt;:\[
---
An unpaid guy in a basement somewhere made a mod for this in like the first two weeks of the game being out, it's actually mind boggling that it's not in game yet.
---
Wait. So you stopped the behavior when you realized that you were inadvertently helping?
---
Tl:dr - The worst review is no review and the best review is any. Feedback, pos. or neg. is helpful.
---
 At any rate I think we should get a way to type up Twitter style notes to drop. Maybe they have a limit we can leave at a camp or in the world at one time.  Would kill this nonsense. Honestly I think some people dont realize what they're selling stuff for. It's like they are priced from the perspective of the vendor bots. Or worse. Lol its laughable sometimes. If I come across it I say,"fuck" craft if I need to and dump scrap in my stash or something and move along. If I give them anymore time it increases the idea in their head they are significant in my gameplay. That is the deal, percieved value.
---
Umm the perks for semi and auto rifles are different, you swap them out each time?
---
Ah. No, I don't have a chassis in the frame. I thought that it worked like every other crafting station. I'll park a frame there and see what happens. Thanks!
---
you need a power armor frame to put in the workbench so you have something to put the pieces on. i think you also need to be level 25 to make the excavator's lowest level version, i can't remember. but mainly you need to have a frame first. they're all over the map, so you could look up a spawn location near your camp or something.
---
My base is NW of westek and the satellite relay tower; so I start at Westek, clear out the mutants, collecting everything, and fat walk to the satellite relay station, clear more super mutants, collecting everything, then fat walk to my base. Usually nets me 1k+ steel, lots of gunpowder, and the occasional legendary. 
---
When leaving westek, I usually leave out of the back entrance on the lower level. There are 4-7 mutants outside, with a good chance of one on the back stairway being a legendary.
---
I have never had scrip issues before this sale. Grinding and killing 3* enemies and getting 1* items makes it tough to hit scrip limits. However, knowing this sale was approaching, I saved up to have a chance at a god roll. Unfortunately I got 90% heavy weapons and now I’m over encumbered and my stash is full while trying to scrip all these useless missile launchers.
---
Read in the data mining thread they were removed in the event changes patch
---
I feel the same on my Xbox One X. Obviously I don't have access to resource monitors, sensors or any kind of this stuff, but when I'm idling on my Camp is the only time I can hear the cooling fan spinning faster, and it immediately slows down when I open the map, and instantly goes back to full speed when I closes it. Not even on blast zones I can hear the fan running as fast as when I'm sleeping on my camp...
---
I want Gatling meat cleaver
---
Lol
---
There's also a bunch in Harpers Ferry, just round the corner from the Vendor bot where the Chemistry station is
---
I had a wet dream about a grognak axe with fast swing, better power attack, and + strenght.
---
So, piggyback question: How (in)frequently do fixer plans drop? How many White Wolf Fedoras do I need to obtain, before I can get my hands on one of these goodies?
---
Also, how does it work? Do you need to obtain a legendary combat rifle, and affix the fixer mod to it? or does it drop as a legendary the fixer?
---
I had a higher level invite me to a random group, I accepted, ended up getting killing by them and they picked up my dropped junk...
---
The only one I care about is the ammo factory. I’ll sneak in, get my remaining ammo and go. If they want it that bad, they can have it. I’ve got other things to do
---
Thanks.  This was the first comment that actually tried to answer a few of my curiosities.
---
Checking the vendors for hidden gems like that is always worth the extra few seconds.
---
In my case, I accidentally scrapped the BoS bomber jacket I had and was rather annoyed. 2 days later I found a replacement at the Watoga station.
---
I call bullshit.
---
Don’t feel bad people come and they go. I like to give people a leg up and they ad me to the friends list. A few people I see almost everyday 99% I never see again. I think a lot has to do with play style. A good friend is someone you can play with and not say anything for a half hour.
---
I have a table by mine, and I've taken to jumping on it and then dropping items so the bag registers there.
---
I do have two camp spots that have world-containers that I try to label and use.
---
600+ for sure with 1* rifleman perks and nerd rage.
---
I usually do multiple queen kills a day and never had this issue.
---
He sounds like a jeep girl...
---
With no rifleman perk cards the Instigating Lever is still quite powerful and conserves my precious 5.56 ammo.  Other times, yes, I swap out perk cards.  I also have a bloodied pipe bolt action that’s a lot of fun...it benefits from both rifle and gunslinger perks if you have the room in agility and can hit for 600+ dmg.  
---
I’m one of the players that’s swapping around one perk card or another every 10-20 minutes.  So it’s just normal for me.  For example, I run stealth most of the time but use a different set up for Queen fights.
---
So, this is happening again huh, maybe that's why the 309485709234875093487509234875 Server not Responding, ffs
---
No sweat.  Now, you get a "Bury the Corpse" quest on every bloody login.  And . . . all those side quests you've already completed keep recurring at random and won't go away until you do them again . . . or sometimes they just autocomplete.  It's still a wild, wild world in Appalachia.
---
I replied to your question, but in the wrong place...
---
I hopped servers forever in Charleston and eventually found the hood in the little clothing boutique across from the hospital/ med center.
---
You state that like it's common. xD  I don't think I've seen a single 76 player asking for or talking about private servers in the context of 'I want to do anything with no restrictions!'
---
I think most people realize there will be restrictions since this is an online experience. And especially given how Bethesda handled Creation Club for FO4.
---
I agree. Sentient ghouls should have been around. That could keep it lore friendly.
---
That was heartbreaking loooool
---
I'm partial to being across from Ohio River Adventures. It's nice and quiet. Also provides a nice stop for the occasional new player who wanders by.
---
That's a very specific one in a million thing to happen though. And events are still the same way. You can leave the event and try and get people to accidentally hit you to spark pvp,. But the times an event leads you through a workshop have to be so minute, the same way disconnected might reload you into a workshop, that I just can't see these being good reasons not to change workshops to consensual PvP zones.
---
Gotcha....good to know then
---
Is that one rare? I've had one laying around but assumed it was just a regular BOS piece.
---
Yes yes and more yes.
---
Alien Gatlings moddable to run on fusion cores. It's literally all I want from a possible alien-themed future DLC.
---
But how will you regulate economy if the transition is allowed? It doesnt make any sense :S
---
I'll have to test this later but I can't see how every workshop isn't covered in traps if this is the case.
---
Oh wow... I didn't realize he was screaming about killing your family.  Thought it was all just game shit.  You made the right call there.
---
If you want an idea of mods look at eso. No one's going to adding in new monsters, or weapons. Seriously people are going to to very dissapointed if they think mods are going any further then UI changes/qol/sounds. I'm excited for it but your expectations should be in the relm of online games and if characters can bounce between private and public then much of game play can not be changed.
---
har
---
I want a Gatling Tesla
---
You are right mate. After all, let's also remove the displays for caps count, ammo, weight, scrip, levels, and everything really. You should be able to keep track of those.
---
I can probably look if you want to know. 
---
Regarding the fixer, have a full auto one on my commando and the recoil is kind of spongy. same with semi auto, just like a combat rifle, the whole gun sort of bounces around and you have to wait for it to settle so that second and third follow up shot isnt as fast as for the handmade.
---
I'm guessing they mean ganking low level players repeatedly to the point that they literally can't play the game because you're killing them every time they respawn. Sure, it's a PvP environment and people should expect to be killed, but when you are following someone around just to keep killing them then it strays into being a dick territory.
---
Great.  I came back happier with most of the changes, bug fixes, added content, etc., but PVP and now reading about how NW works is a little disappointing.  With Wastelanders being delayed too I guess It'll be a while before possible changes are even considered.  
---
  It's all fine I suppose.  Thanks for the info and actually addressing one of my questions.
---
Not really these days, though it's probably not considered common as muck either, more in the middle. I've just only ever had it once and never got another drop for it.
---
unlike other methods of "raiding", workshops are a legit game mechanic and people shouldn't be upset if they get killed by a player while owning one. the game straight-up tells you when you start to claim it that dong so flags PvP for you, as other might want the resources you're getting, so you should know what you're getting into.
---
personally, i stay the hell away from workshops unless i'm desperate for a specific type of scrap. but if i DO, i fully expect to get murdered eventually and build the appropriate defenses.
---
There are fish in the game already.  The river on the west side of the map is full of them.
---
Ah okay. I've played since November and still haven't really started the BOS quests so I assumed it came from there. Thanks!
---
With some fava beans and a nice Chianti.
---
This is a known trap btw. A low level on a team will attack you. If you take the bait the others come in and kill you....people are annoying
---
I believe a bigger scope requires more AP.  So a simple reflex dot will maximize AP, while a long scope will use more.  I’ve also noticed automatic rifles use less AP than semi autos.  This has been my experience and is not data based.
---
Sorry, honest question, why wouldn't the Gauss Gatling have to spin since even the regular rifle gauss can be powered up by charging the shot? My guess is that it'll ''spin" or an equivalent to charge its barrels and reach its maximum damage potential.
---
Now the real reason for all those legendary shovels from the SBQ become obvious.
---
Me and my buds play everyday. Like to help lower level folks.

---
They will likely wait until tomorrow. Basicly if its going to be like other games of the genre expect the server costs to 10$ a month minimum. With it likely being 100$ a year minimum.
---
yeah. NEVER accept a team invite from someone you don't know. they end up initiating pvp with another group of their friends that they have waiting so they can kill you despite Pacifist mode being on.
---
I'm not sure I understand your concerns. xD
---
I buy a private server, I invite only people I trust. Whether or not transition is allowed is therefore irrelevant. Play on the servers of people you know and trust and you won't have problems!
---
Hey Bethesda, give merchants 500,000 caps. Best way to end this issue. Lol
---
Thanks, these two plan can only be bought and not learned - unless something changed recently.
---
How did he fail?!
---
I don't know how often it drops from Encrypted (bought mine off a player vendor for 500 caps a few months ago). And the only way to get a legendary fixer is from the purveyor, or another player who it got it from the purveyor. The catch is you need to know the plan before it gets added to your pool of potential purveyor drops. In terms of modding it, you simply need to scrap combat rifles. You do not need to build/scrap other fixers for mods.
---
still no dancing emotes tho...
---
They got rid of survival server as no one used it except as there weekly garrenteed 3* farm. Why would bethesda pay for anything players dont use.
---
I know there was a group of them in the game, but they were killed by another faction and some fled.  But it would have been so much cooler if say Rose was a ghoul instead.
---
Loaded it up for the first time since borderlands 3 been out to do the vendor discount. Hit up west tek and it sometimes took 4 hits with melee before the enemies would take damage at all and the input lag for doing any task loading up map etc.. Enough said.
---
they said that Wastelanders is people coming BACK to appalachia. so i imagine the majority of anyone who did survive left the area years ago, and everyone we will soon meet are either people who lived in west virginia and left, coming back to their homes, or people who are just traveling from other areas. that said, i am certain that there are a few pockets here and there that have survivors in them, that will conveniently open up around the same time.
---
Dodgeball time!
---
Was thinking the same thing a few minutes ago, pulled a Furious Fixer last night, I want to see if my luck continues today...
---
You must know the Fixer Plan to have a chance for the Purveyor to drop a legendary Fixer,
---
As far as I know they do not drop any other way.
---
I've done \~60+ Imposter Sheepsquatch events and only gotten 2 of the Plans.
---
My concern is that ppl from modded servers will hop on unmodded adventure mode. You sure understand what would this cause.
---
Instigating +40% power attack +1 strength Grognak’s Axe
---
Yes!  I also use all 5 characters and this would be awesome.  A notification would be too easy to miss, this would be better.
---
There should also be one for the Legendary scrapping machines (I think they also run on a 20 hour timer but I could be Mistaken.)
---
Wise words.
---
The Fixer plan is a random drop that can pop the first time you do the Encrypted event, or never.  Hasn’t dropped for me after more attempts than I can hope to count.  
---
The plan builds a Fixer.  Then use combat rifle mods to mod it how you like.  Once you learn the plan there is a chance to get a legendary version from the purveyor.
---
Yeah, it wasn't frightening to me in the first place, it was disturbing and being an advocate for mental health I am concerned for his psychological well being. Which those two other redditors keep trying to dismiss as me being scared for my life genuinely, which would be a lie. I've had a gun pointed in my face in real life during a robbery of a convenience store 17 years ago. That's the only situation I ever feared for my life in. Also the reason I started training in Kung Fu. Not that martial arts can stop a bullet by any means, but I was 13 and needed to feel a little more safe.
---
Good builds are typically your efficient builds. Max damage or max carry weight or whatever the goal is. You can definitely run a build parked for both melee and rifles but you'll ha e ti sacrifice something. Give it a go.
---
Also if workshops can be made persistant, they could be used for small scale faction play. Having Workshops remaining persistantly and simply being flipped ownerships. To give folks a more consistent way of pvp. While leaving the rest of the world pvp free. But again think this is mostly aimed at people that want to specifically play with friends and not deal with the trash that keeps trying to force things on others.
---
There’s a difference between displays of crucial information and notifications that provides a form of QOL.
---
And it’s good for you too, makes you more multi faceted.
---
You can build a jack-of-all-trades character (I've done it), and you'll do alright, but you'll always be leaving something on the table. A pure melee character will have 15 strength. A pure rifle character will have 15 perception. There's no way to square that circle. 
---
You can combine melee with heavy guns and/or shotguns much easier since those weapons use strength perks. 
---
If you have a strong rifle build, you can use a melee weapon as a backup to save on ammo, but you'll never compete with the damage of a pure melee build.
---
That's kinda creepy lol
---
There's a couple places I think this map is missing. To the east of the crazy cat lady house (13) there are 3 different cabins that you can build in with the northern most cabin having several super mutants spawning. The center cabin is probably the easiest to build in but you'll have the super mutants wander over ocassionally and attack your camp. You can also build you camp at the Wilson's brother's auto repair shop even though it's a marked location. If you place your camp right you can encompass the garage and the house behind it. That's actually where I currently have my camp set up
---
I get so annoyed when people say the exceptionally lame pvp at workshops is an integral part of the game.  I'll accept that when you can't go to a defense event at them and get shot in the back of the head while helping kill molerats.  And when an actual pvp timer is added so people can't hit V, Q, click click and you're dead before you even know what's happening.  It's not a fun mechanic or a decent pvp experience either.  It mostly currently serves as a mechanic for lame behavior.
---
a whole farming update would be totally awesome (incl. keeping pets!)
---
if you’re on xbox i can get u the plans later
---
Have to agree, I'm currently using just a 1\* Bloodied Handmade and it just shreds everything.
---
[Gauss Gatling and Shotgun](https://i.imgur.com/kdE7yjP.png) It looks like it could spin but we wont know until it's in game  
---
[Gauss Pistol and Plasma Caster](https://i.imgur.com/kpo9vot.png) I expect the Plasma caster to work like in New Vegas.
---
So I could do a hybrid build?
---
Agreed
---
Youre lucky. I got mostly trash.
---
they were hoping the "every human is another real person" thing to be a hit. they wanted people to become the shopkeeper, the raider, the faction leader. it wasn't and we didn't (except for raiders and shopkeepers, but shopkeepers weren't properly positioned until vending machines were added). even the Raider players we got were few and far between. as Todd himself said at E3, "we created a nuclear wasteland, and everybody's nice to each other!"
---
i'm certain they realized that just having US be the npcs and instigate meaningful conflict wasn't going to happen, so they needed to create an actual human threat. hence, not only human NPCs returning, but factions as well.
---
Wow, yeah this surprised me.  I just read up on how NW mode works.  I had wrongly assumed it was just survival mode tied into a battle royale.  For me personally that's just disappointing.
---
I have the exact opposite problem.
---
There’s always one chillin in the middle of a field to the left of my camp. He’s always there just. Looking at me..
---
They need to make certain areas on the map pvp areas.  I think the savage divide would be a nice area for this.
---
Another thing Bethesda needs to look at is workshop pvp.  They need to make the workshops into something that players covet.  If they made them create finished items it would be great. This would promote more organic pvp.
---
\-ballistic fiber and cloth factory
---
\-alcohol bottling plant
---
\-Nuka cola plant
---
\-Dog food/canned food plant
---
\-weapon manufacturing
---
\-gold/silver mines (make gold and silver scrap worth more)
---
\-etc
---
One other thing to create would be a fight stadium (Raider organized) in the game somewhere.  Allow players to bet on the outcome.  Also make different types of battles.  
---
\-only knives
---
\-only fists
---
\-no armor
---
\-shoot out with no vats
---
\-player vs. animal 
---
\-etc.
---
I am, and I do appreciate it. I already have the plans I just never got the key to the Dome. Everything was so crazy when it was first available that it got really buggy trying to get the key. Started trying again a couple months ago and this popped up.
---
According to support two months ago this was a known issue and was going to be fixed.
---
that would add so much differentiation to characters and playstyles, i love it!
---
Pure rifle has 13 PER ;)
---
Yea that would be a private game, not a private server. If i dont get to keep the server as mine, when i log off. Im not buying.
---
The Fixer is basically just a Combat Rifle with the added Stealth Bonus.
---
Other Legendary perks on them function normally.
---
I have a Ghoul Slayer's, Vats Crits +50%, &amp; 25% Less Vats Cost on a Bloodied Stealth Rifleman build that One hits level 68 Ghouls with ease.
---
You should try it out. It’s fun. I like the fact that everyone goes in on a pretty even playing field. Sure you can get perks over time but at the end of the day it comes down to skill. Way more balanced than survival was.
---
I'm not going to look at ESO, ESO isn't made by Bethesda and doesn't operate like Fallout 76. xD
---
I'm going to look at FO4, which is what 76 was based off of, and which is made by Bethesda. Even looking at Creation Club I can see new weapons, new settlement stuff, new quests related to the unlocking of some items, etc. 
---
Nobody knows how private servers and mods will function, but I have no reason to assume it's going to be like ESO or be super restrictive. You say expectations should be in the realm of online games, and yet here we are getting private servers this week, so why would I need to think about a game like ESO which is *always* a communal experience and has no private servers?
---
Also, it's not hard to prevent players from transitioning between public and private servers with their characters. I'm not sure why you've convinced yourself that there will be open migration between servers...
---
Yea for sure I’m just saying this dude did not kill a level 300+ with a level 20 lol
---
I don't even know how people do this. I thought duping was gone but I hear about this alot. Still never seen it in game
---
Yes 1 factor is alot of the pvp community who enjoyed and actively played pvp but alot of players have moved on to BorderLands 3 and same goes for alot of the YT community as there covering Borderlands 3 since its release. And how u can get P2W gernades that give you endless in game money.
---
u/Valseek
---
It would ruin the entire game, it wouldn't be fun.
---
I’ve always thought it was just a gimmick. Bethesda made a point that  “the only humans you see are other players,” so I feel that it was to emphasize the online aspect of a Fallout game. Already, there are non-human NPC’s in the game to interact with, so those could just as easily have been made humans.
---
Up those numbers, I sell them for 60 and people buy them all up
---
if we could "level up" weapons would be the perfect solution (with exponentially more expensive costs w/ each level up)
---
my level 225 character would love to use that level 15 perfect storm \[w/o wasting 763 rounds against a cave crickett... \]
---
This is amazing. Id give it a prize but I'm not willing to spend money on reddit. Fantastic concepts
---
some challenges ask for "formal clothing" or whatever, so maybe they think they're being helpful.
---
the real issue isn't players putting it in their machines, but the game listing clothing as armor. it should really be two separate categories.
---
Thanks for the tag! We're aware of these reports and we're looking into them.
---
So my question is, why do you think Bethesda would allow players to do that? xD  
---
It's clearly a messy situation, so the simplest solution is that people will not be able to freely migrate characters once mods arrive.
---
I’ve accepted more random team invites than I can count and never once had an issue

 &gt; Thanks for the tag! We're aware of these reports and we're looking into them.
---
I agree with you 100% . But i just doubt Bethesda is going to do anything about it
---
My befr railway does 1500-2000 damage when I vats headshots, costs very little vats and fires all ten shots in less then a second. I killed a sheepsquatch before I had to reload the other day. Just way too op.
---
Keep it. If nothing else use it on griefers. If they aren't wearing power armor in most cases you will destroy them with it. It is an exceptional weapon to have sitting in your wheel just in case.
---
Instigating is great, make sure to get at least one level of the Covert Operative Perk, and max out Sneak.
---
Kill SuperMutants for the ammo, Grafton area is good for that.
---
I agree 100%. To me it's part of the fun of the game trying to keep the crucial items while balancing the items you really dont need.
---
PC, Australian timezone.
---
Pv p is always bad
---
I have used it and do have a semi solid plan on what way I want to mold my character, that’s why I’ve decided to focus on power armor, rifles and two handed melee. But any suggestions and help are much appreciated!!
---
I don't think that's what he meant because he spefically said bloodied, which you don't need to "grief" a low level so I'd bet my whole stash he's salty about being killed buy peers his own level, but with much better gear and builds.
---
Everyone that survived the in fighting, radiation, hunger, diseases, animals etc. Got fucked up their asses by an experiment from our o so favorite resident ass holes (Enclave) who also got it up the ass lol. Which got loose and infected/killed everyone since they got caught with their pants down and failed to finish the immunity serum before they got shat on hard.
---
Is that perk under Agility? I’ll be sure to nab it ASAP.
---
After someone leaves the server, collectrons sometimes stay behind, but are immobile. WS station is usually full of these glitches guys because it’s a camp hotspot.
---
They should have a hub in game wherr people meet up to join a que for NW. That way people have a place to gather around.
---
I want the box planters like in 4. I would love to put them on the roof , away from destruction
---
If you have to ask then the answer is yes. SOMEONE MAKE THIS IDEA HAPPEN!!!

I like shadowed wood armor for the sneak bonuses; I may be in the minority. I just run bloodied commando sneaking. 
---
Heavy combat is of course good with defensive bonuses.
---
Also, every other game the weapons ARE leveled it just doesnt say it, you wouldnt find a railroad rifle until level 20, you wont find half of the weapons UNTIL A CERTAIN LEVEL. Immagine seeing a level 5 with a f***ing tse tesla rifle, it would be stupid!
---
I prefer the lever, due to it's exceptional punch and for its flexible and quick bullet-at-a-time reload. 
---
I find the gauss exceptionally fun as well, though have never had the intelligence perks to reduce the weight of the gauss ammo, so it's a dalliance, not a long-term choice for me. 
---
If I'm going to use a handmade or fixer, I prefer the full-auto versions (commando).
---
If you mean an actual story that's not told by stupid fucking robots voice recorders and computers then no
---
True, but who is keeping the overseer safe?

What's it look like worn?

What are the collectrons for even? I see them everywhere

She survived all of Appalachia on her own, she'll be fine. That last holotape made it sound like she was in a rough state, but she fought off moleminers with no problem so. Yeah, she's fine. Maybe.
---
Is that perk under Agility? I’ll be sure to nab it ASAP
---
This guy gets it.
---
Fair enough
---
Really? Work for me.
---
Thanks bud.  I play as a responder but I would love to have so cool raider stuff and pvp added back into the game. There is something about having to look over your shoulder that adds a lot to the game imo.
---
After all this time harvesting these plants in the wild we should know how to plant them ourselves.
---
In the late game it'll be useless since it's only lvl 25. Save up your legendary scrip and use it when you're lvl 50, ensuring anything you get is max lvl
---
They should at least have caps show up if you purchase something from them. Bethesdas can even take their 10% just let us purchase items and have the vendors caps reflect that purchase
---
Fishing rods exist fwiw as a junk item
---
I used to sell them for 50 and they got snapped up very fast. After I saw a bunch of vendors selling at 100, i matched that. They still sell very fast &gt;&lt;
---

Meh, I sell fusion cores for 1c a piece unless they’re full, then it’s 10c a piece.

Plans go for 5c a piece.

---
Nah, just dead inside.
---
Oh you mean in the game.  Nevermind.
---
One of the Vaults is tied to Wastelanders, or at least is hinted at. Likely a dungeon/raid tied to it, since supposedly some of the wastelanders came because of a rumored treasure in one of the vaults. Though could be wrong.
---
Mothman just wants attention 😃 Or your **LAMP!**
---
Also, the lack of raiders takes away that fallout experience and.. Your job 😂
---
That is?
---
Im aiming for god level dmg mitigation. Running Dodgy, Supressor, Lone Wanderer and Fireproof perks.
---
My goal is to be really durable bloodied build.
---
Lol I have lvl 15 sent assassin's and lvl 25 tse handmade... I handle my own friend 
---
Also I've been playing since beta and lvl does not mean anything after lvl 50 I could kill a lvl 650 if they do not have the right gear.
---
Hell travled to a vender a few days bk who was trying to sell lvl 35 3* zelot's for 20k and other junk lvl 35 2* legendaries for 13k tottal waste of time. I was next to Ws station so figured it was a high lvl seller. Nope it was a low lvl.
---
kill everyone and anyone at workshops because loot and caps
---
There was one floating over the lake in front of my camp yesterday when i spawned in. I wish they could be damaged once their owner leaves the server.
---
It’s probably like 4.5lbs max so just hold on to it.
---
I might eventually but it just doesn't appeal to me.  At that point it's just a Fallout re-skin/mashup of any battle royale game really.  I don't play them now and I'm probably not going to start playing NW anytime soon.
---
okay, will he/she be bloodied, junkie or something else? depends on what gear you can get maybe?
---
regarding PA, not all perks work in PA. There are some conflicting theories there. My heavy gunner in PA uses actionboy and dodgy, and the emergency protocol mod for the PA chest is a must.
---
electrically charged mutation is annoying as hell if you ask me. marsupial and adrenal reaction feels mandatory, even for non-bloodied.
---
I do this, and have also never had a problem. However, I know it is a possibility, so I make sure I don't have any junk on me that I particularly want to keep, just in case. It's nice to be nice, but it's not nice to be stupid and know I had none to blame but myself.
---
I can agree with that, but the current camp price is far too low. I quit playing mainly because vendors have too few caps and having a few thousand while overencumbered with such a tiny stash size isn't a fun gameplay loop. I'm used to using mods on FO4 that give vendors like 30,000-50,000caps to offload purified water from settlements. Much more fun that way. :3
---
Whats your time zone?
---
Are you asking about just using the bloodied effect, or asking for the best number you can get out of bloodied, nerd rage, adrenal reaction, stealth, and headshots? Are you looking for the damage shown on the weapon-screen or the "show damage numbers" value?
---
I know it’s not endgame worthy but I’m just hoping it’s something I can use for a while to get me closer to level 50
---
Since I got one right out of Vault 76 on Reclamation Day One I’ve wished they were protected and could be worn
---
Hands on hips. Just face your back to the camera.
---
If the event is in the workshop area all the workshop owner has to do is drop the event and start killing anyone trying to complete it. No need to try and trigger PvP because they are already in your workshop auto PvP zone.They then get auto respawned by the event... that's not exactly consensual PvP.
---
Combat is the best one in terms of good stats across the board except rad resist
---
When did you buy your account?
---
Yeah, my rifleman main has 14 perception, so I fudged a bit. Good point. My melee character really is 15 strength.
---
Due to how slow they walk, the server will crash before most of them can get there.
---
May want to consider bolstering sentinel??
---
Alas. You remind me of a time before the bombs dropped.
---
People were kinder then. More honest you know?
---
Agreed. Unless there’s an insane person who wants to trade for a bloodied, ffr, weight reduced handmade.
---
I have really good gear, I have full sent assas... Lvl 15 and a lvl 15 tse handmade. He was in power armor... And after lvl 50 lvl means nothing....
---
There is a very Small chance to get PA part plans from Treasure maps, I've only gotten T-60 plans from CB Bog, and Raider plans from Savage Divide, the Mire drops both T-45 &amp; T-51, if you have a team mate stand near you while you dig, they will also receive a small amount of loot.
---
Should you choose to sell some of your maps, I pay 50 caps each for Cranberry Bog, 40 for Mire, and 30 for Savage Divide.
---
🤔
---
I believe this question can only be answered on an individual basis. Some things in this game you have to follow your own moral compass. If you have to question it beforehand, it is probably not something your compass agrees with and it probably won't sit well with you after. It is because of this that I just loosely follow my own set of guidelines. As usual, I have zero expectation that anybody else in this game will agree or follow suit, but there are some general principles that keep me from questioning myself when things are all said and done.
---
* If I see a level 29 with one or two workshops, I leave them be. I'll even show up to help with defend events. If I see another high level player contest, I will show up to give that high level the pvp they are looking for and I will stick around as long as they are willing to continue.
---
* If I see a level 29 with 5 workshops, my moral compass tells me they need a lesson on workshop mechanics. In these cases I won't shoot at them unless they shoot at me. I'm more than happy to give them the opportunity to walk away.
---
* I recently took the Red Rocket from two level 15s. When I saw they had it my first thought was what in the hell are two level 15s doing at the Red Rocket aside from messing up mob spawn levels in the whole zone? So I contested it. I sat in the workshop area for 5 minutes without firing a shot while they verbally degraded myself, my family tree, etc. Eventually one of them went a little too far with the insults and I killed him. I let the other one walk out.
---
I kinda want rad resi tho, to counter ghouls. Should I focus on marine armor then?
---
Keep it . Always good to have if you decide you want to use it.
---
I got a pretty severe wanted status by wandering onto Billings Homestead when somebody had done this.  No defenses but punji boards.  
---
Tried looking to see if this had been changed but i either got taken to fo4 wikis or articles on actual punji traps.
---
Yes, and it doubles your damage while in stealth,
---
For what it’s worth I don’t usually find battle royales interesting at all. In fact I find them boring. Somehow this game mode has kept me interested. I also like how as you level up you gain access to additional areas in vault 51 and can slowly explore and learn more about what happened there. 
---
Anyway I don’t blame you for being hesitant. I was also. It’s not just fornite in fallout. It definitely is its own thing. The current Morgantown map is cool also.
---
That and the pretty pink princess beds
---
Then yes that would be a good option for you
---
I wish they'd bring back the old Adventure cause I made it a point to hunt wanted people.
---
Yeah, you can do hybrid. You're just going to feel like enemies are tougher than someone with a pure build. It made it really hard to solo a sheepsquatch, but there's very little content that you cannot do solo at endgame, and none that you cannot do with friends.
---
No, having 40 in main stats is just too good.
---
Before? If anything I prefer after with r/PKOA being born and the song by Miracle of Sound Starting Over I feel Mankind can be reborn and redefined into a species where everyone works together to achieve a common goal

Ah, I try to be the salesmen of the waste. I'm constantly buying and selling for decent prices compared to most, but you're beating me. I try to stay close to max caps on both characters so if theres a weapon I need I can buy it
---
They had next to no direction when they designed the game, they said as much in that no clip documentary. They threw a bunch of ideas (some of them contrary to each other) at the wall to see what would stick. Well, what stuck was playing dress up and Sims housing.
---
It takes newer players a while to figure out pricing and if they follow the sales reddits it can give a pretty awful pricing foundation.
---
This person gets it, all player's are the Human NPCs and have been there since day one.
---
Workshop clearly states pvp. Nothing wrong done. Experience is educational.
---
Also get a high level player to Mod it with the Hardened Receiver, Perforating mag, and a Suppressor.
---
This. I run an auto handmade. I keep a 3* 90% weight reduced gauss because it weighs 4lbs, but I kept forgetting I have it. The bloodied handmade’s just sooo good!

I think the train tunnel at Harper's ferry might be a hiding spot for underground free states forces.

Yes! I see normal cats walking around every now and then. Just let me keep/pet a cat! Lol
---
Also I've spent so many caps traveling to a camp only to have the person log out before I even find their vendor. I always look to make sure no one is at my camp before logging. Wish more people would.

TL;DR:

Scout has higher DR   
---
Combat has MUCH higher ER

Yeah on the 19th i crashed 5 times trying to eat or drink an aid item. Incredibly frustrating - frequently happens when i get the hunger/thirst warning but not always.

You're my hero. This is EXACTLY why I don't have the red stove. Or a fridge. They can sell us clothes that are brand new looking, so don't try to tell me they do it for "immersion". \*sighs\* Maybe some day, when they run out of raider/free states ideas, and stop with the damn tires, we'll get lucky, friend.

**What I would love to see is...** an indicator, icon color change or something showing me that I've visited a persons C.A.M.P. so I'm not hitting the persons camp up multiple times a night because, there are so many C.A.M.P.s in the room. 
---
The color change or indicator would have the ability to go away if the person has added new inventory.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
I had one that got stuck with my camp....3 or 4 different servers and it was always stuck in the same spot. I dont even own the collectron
---
I have found four of them at a time glitched stuck around an unused acid resource just west of Arktos Pharma.
---
Damn good to know, thank you!
---
... So it's $14 for a PA skin, which has zero practical use and just makes things look cool? I agree that the fridge is overpriced, but at least it DOES something.
---
I does have it's down sides - The other issue I have is mag size (the stinging mag on the handmade holds 35, not sure if that is an oversight though) and I'm not convinced about the accuracy in vats - I'm going to do some proper testing tonight but it 'feels' less accurate but that could be a number of things. But on the plus side it is lighter than a handmade.
---
Ya it does give bad prices. Yes lvl 50 3* go for high but no were near that high.
---
At 19% HP my BE Lever does 700 paper dmg.
---
Add the 3.75x sneak bonus for having Mister Sandman and Covert Operative (you have to equip Sandman first), and the 2,675 dmg one-shots everything but scorchbeasts; those usually take 3-4 shots depending on where it's hit.

It does. 53 vs 50 for powerful auto receivers, 58 vs 56 for hardened. Equal fire rate in full auto. Handmade fires slightly faster in semi auto though I believe
---
Two shot lever action, or any legendary lever action, at this point I would take anything the game gives me lmao.
---
I had this happen to me as well. Turns out I had some smoke grenades in my stash. Once I got rid of them I haven’t had an issue since.
---
It works on Xbox one. I've been using it near launch. Spread the secrets!
---
Bloodied Chameleon snipers. No one wanted to join PvP servers to instantly get their head popped off by an invisible camper.
---
They had to roll out some major hotfixes to Survival spawning pretty quickly because people were camping with Bloodied sniper builds or planting mines on the spawn points, which remain fixed and allowed patient assholes to just wait for someone to load into the area and take them out before their controls were even enabled.
---
&gt;by 'private' simply mean "no one else can enter unless you OK it"
---
Purely speculation, but i'm 99.999999% sure this it what they will be and nothing more.
---
Please note that Sentinel does not work while crouched. If you spend most of your time in stealth, you won't notice any difference with sentinel, though it will help you if you're detected and stand-up to fight.
---
Heavy BOS modded combat armor has higher DR and ER than sturdy buttress-modded marine, partly because marine doesn't come in a heavy variant. Another problem with marine armor is that it's much harder to unlock the mods (buttressed was a project). The benefit of marine is the additional rad resistance. 
---
Despite that, there's diminishing returns on DR/ER, so at some point it's better to get "powered" to fuel dodgy, or "sentinel" for when you're standing, rather than worrying about the base-type of the armor piece.
---
Try grouping with somebody then see if you can get rid of it. 
---
This mutation is bugged all to hell. When you are not in a group it does not show up in your mutation list, but you surely have the -2 special points. When you are grouped it shows up in the list and you have +2 points, but that +2 charisma does not work toward card sharing.
---
That is with most guns, the automatic versions do less damage but costs less vats. Depends on your build which is most effective for you. The perk card concentrated fire will give you more accuracy for non auto guns per shot, but the automatics fire faster so they can build up accuracy and damage at a similar rate. Automatic is good for furious since it builds up to the 50% bonus damage faster, and instigating is better with hardened receivers. My instigating fixer has ffr so if I miss a headshot in vats I can fire again with 10% (lvl 1 concentrated fire) or 20% more accuracy per shot (lvl 3) allowing me to snipe headshots in vats. If it misses it's not explosive so I won't lose the double damage. I can deal massive sneak damage and one shot most mobs.
---
So...can you really say its not just as easy to find one of the formal wear items out in the world, as it is to randomly travel to vendors looking for it?
---
Did it look like a scout mask with bits of fern coming off the side? If so it's the vault 94 raid mask. Given for completing a raid on expert
---
This. I dropped the game for about a year and recently picked it back up so I’m around lvl 30. Was looting a raider camp (not even a workshop!) and a level 200+ tried to initiate PvP! I tried to run away and he kept chasing me, too. Come on dude, you KNOW that isn’t fair.
---
So wait, let me get this straight. You are already holding “essential weapons and armors” and you find something you want to use but you aren’t a high enough level to use, now wouldn’t  that make it essential enough to idk stash? And I mean the sheer fact you are holding onto 200lbs of meds is just plain ridiculous, get traveling pharmacy to level three and just keep the meds on you for a lot less wait.  Also there was a time we only had 400lbs to use in the stash and I made due like everyone else.
---
It has been right under my nose for months, and I've been overlooking it since forever. 
---
My cliffside camp's sights and vistas are looking killer thanks to this little discovery.
---
We need scavengers for the scavengers
---
Very solid weapon that should help take you close to level 50. Invest in covert operative for more sneak damage to stack on top of the instigating effect. Scrap every basic Handmade you find or buy the plan to scrap them until you unlock the hardened receiver. 
---
Handmade does great damage and even at 25, with the right receiver it should last you a while.
---
Pc
---
No I have the raid one, it looked like the front of Groot's face was cut off and worn on the face
---
Sort of :) Not all scopes increase AP cost (some do though) but a reflex sight reduces AP cost as do automatic receivers. Also, aligned stock and barrels reduce it too:

Check out Watoga from behind the Monorail Elevator on top of the mountain. Perfect view!
---
Weird. Might have to submit a ticket if it's a bug for me personally. I'd actually do the quest if I didn't have to get the password every time.
---
You can pay me 500-2k caps and I can follow you in the raid, die a few times and say a few cheeky comments if you'd like.
---
I dislike level scaling in general tbh but it's just kinda how the game is designed. Gotta give people something to grind for.
---
Exactly my situation as well
---
When is the whole dlc thing gonna come out?
---
I believe it is from the dev room.
---
I don't recall ever getting them from Toxic Valley, but have definitely gotten Raider Plans from Savage Divide maps, on my main Character I can currently build all PA parts except for T-60 Left Arm.
---
Damn ok see ya then.
---
I guess I see workshops as a PVP mechanic and claiming one is saying to the server "I want to pvp, come pvp with me."
---
Doesn't seem to work on PC, but adding fDOFBlendRatio=0 to Fallout76Custom.ini under [Display] seems to properly disable DOF.
---
I dont know. People stil play this horrible game?
---
Thank you, didnt know about the standing. I am crouched all the time for sneak attacks, so sentinel would be a huge waste...also thanks for the alternatives :)
---
Yup  commando parks 9/9, tank killer 3/3 and concentrated fire 1/3. Anything else is just... uncivilized.
---
That's funny. Of course we're all nice to each other, there's nothing gained by not being nice. Factions would definitely help, I think.
---
I have a IFFR-90% gauss that I pull out every time I have \~50 or more gauss rounds on hand, and I use it until they're gone. It is fun, but more situational. It's great for long-range open spaces. The gauss feels scary to use in tight spaces.
---
That is too bad, I hope they add it because I like how it looks!
---
My man!
---
&gt;we dont have a chat system for friends on pc
---
still? I played about one year ago and they did not improved this!?
---
"Who else would it be??" is the most ironic part as well
---
To be fair mole miners are of little threat compared to a bunch of other creatures.
---
All Bethesda had to do was remove the moronic damage cap they imposed, and disable VATS against players like in NW; and they would have avoided most of the negative feedback.
---
Their poor decisions (dmg cap especially) forced the "fastest fire rate" meta to be competitive.  It completely eliminated the viability of being a sniper, or anything else related to slow-firing-high-damage weapons.  If they absolutely "had" to reduce weapon damage, they should have done it by weapon type instead of a blanket cap.  But they decided to be lazy instead, and the server/gameplay suffered because of that.
---
Until Bethesda decides to employ devs that have actual experience with online PvP balancing, we're just going to get "stab in the dark" attempts that frustrate everyone.
---
Yeah, this seems to happen more with vendors that actually have good items, especially high priced ones.  Very frustrating.  The 30k cap limit is the issue.  Players get notified of a sale that puts them near the 30k cap limit, then immediately log out in hopes of catching it before someone else buys a high-cap item that puts them over the limit.  I'd bet most mule vendors are shut down immediately after one or two good sales, tops, until caps can be redistributed.  
---
I wish there was a better way to handle caps limits.  I know why they do it: to prevent runaway inflation.  I'd initially thought that the solution would be to just cancel sales that would put the vendor over the limit, but that would be annoying as well.  You'd end up with vendors with dozens of items that can't be purchased, but players have no incentive to shut them down while there are still one or two low-price items left in stock.  That's the only thing I can think of that would be more frustrating than finding a vendor full of trash- finding a vendor full of good items that can't be bought.
---
I agree with those recommending that you keep it, it’s light and could come in handy against rude peeps or human npcs.
---
It Is likely to be fixed like that, if it ever gets fixed. It should be marked by áreas, like those horde events, so we need to find the bastard.
---
Sucks to suck, commie
---
There's a challenge to claim every workshop in the game once for 80 Atoms reward. It was nice of you to let them claim it.
---
No need to be a dick. I absolutely understand the game timeline versus RL.   
---
I am very familiar with  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline)   
---
But what you are saying and what they have been doing are two very different things.
---
On PS4 I still have like 3000 grenades to off if anyone wants.  Still overnecumbered since the grenade glitch last year haha. Had close to 90k
---
Only if they add a freaking toggle to the notifications. They have already gone overboard with this metagame notification BS.
---
Voice acting and animation are exspensive.
---
Cool I will add you once I get home!
---
It would be a good idea if armour and clothing were separated into 2 categories so we could see.  
---
I dont mind clothing being in there - after all some players do sell rarer clothing. But it would be helpful to see them separated.
---
Or smaller. And square. Be nice to build a tight compound with people.
---
I unlock covert ops my next level so I’ll absolutely be investing in that!
---
follow up shots are tricky when you have to wait for the gun to settle. anyways, I run a non legendary full auto fixer on my commando and it gets the job done. but you have to do short controlled bursts center mass - the recoil often walks the bullet up and gets you a head shot at the end of the burst.
---
It used to be bobby pins. Do people not use those anymore?
---
Is there a bug or glitch with this weapon?
---
I was by myself , anyone trying to take a workshop in power armor is doing it wrong .. power armor is weak and at lvl 20 I can kill anyone using it
---
I know, that is normally my policy I was trying to be nice... I just returned and really don't have much so I was trying... cost me 3 hours of collecting :(
---
Edit: I should add that the reason I accepted was when I came back my friend whom I used to group with did not, so I have been going it alone... my mistake
---
Hm. No idea then. Sounds cool though, since wood armors the only one without a helmet
---
Just get a bloodied explosive version of whatever gun you prefer. With mutations and the right gun, you wont even need all the damage perks to do enough damage to solo anything. This allows you to free up perks for quality of life stuff like weight reduction or Gunsmith/White Knight so your stuff doesn't break as fast. If you incorporate sneak and vats perks and get yourself some decent unyielding armor, you'll be unstoppable and only really need to worry about killing yourself - accidentally with your own explosives.
---
It really depends on the mood, sometimes chill questing in adventure mode is crazy fun, but I miss survival sooo much
---
I was by myself and did not receive any help other then my lvl 1 turrets.... They were in power armor
---
I’d be satisfied if they’d provide planters for those of us whose CAMP is on a hill, and constantly have a hassle trying to plant mutfruit.
---
I think i saw it in one of the datamined skins. They were freestate skins and the wood armor had that mask. If you are on pc that is obviously an illegal item
---
And you can additional steel from bots and scorched that spawn just up the hill.
---
That would be hilarious
---
Can you explain what is this about? I have found the X-01 Quantum paintjob unlocked so this is something else right?
---
You're really focused on a very obscure situation happening where you end up in a workshop against your will. I'm not sure what events you're doing that drag you through workshops constantly but just a FYI as it stands now that someone can still hang out in any unowned workshop and claim it as soon as someone walks through to kill them. The difference would be they can't do that anymore. I don't think someone possibly dying occasionally, and in your examples extremely specific weird circumstances that you even say involve random disconnects and stuff, is a good reason for anything in this game not to happen.
---
Fresh bodies are not really much of an indicator though.... I think the most recent notes and terminal entries outside of the Overseer were from 3 or 4 years before Reclamation Day? Yet we find bodies that are supposedly years old still intact. People like Maria Chavez, other Responders and Brotherhood members. While the Scorched don't seem to eat corpses, ghouls animals and insects would.
---
I look at the state of bodies as a more general thing. Skeletons are those that died right after the bombs dropped. Intact bodies are the survivors or vault dwellers who died since then.
---
No it doesn't.  The fixer has a slightly higher base damage.
---
Collect scrap and junk for the owner
---
I couldn't give you an answer really. The only place you would even really notice the difference would be sbq.
---
Can you post a screenshot of it not working?
---
Wait, so I can do this and not actually kill anyone? Just have to do my best to stay alive? Well this changes things. I use VATS because I can't shoot worth a darn, so I have been steering WAY clear of NW. But I like the rewards. I just figured that I wouldn't get them, and that's that, but if you can get these points without killing anyone...
---
I think the seed is per server. Usually if I get hot garbage one character like that I switch.
---
That way I get a different flavor of hot garbage haha.
---
I see why people would want mutations and obviously I want them but you lose them to a radaway, is there anyway I can keep a mutation and still be free of rads
---
IMO, having a separate server with PvP always on is better because that way people who do not want to PvP can access the whole map without worrying about other people. Too bad they removed Survival Mode.
---
I hope that we can keep the ability to migrate back and forth as long as no mods are used. I only want to use them as a way to play raids and other laggy content , without so much lag.
---
I almost always play with friends
---
What do you think about is the pvp problem with adventure  an actual problem with the game mode? Or with the player base?
---
Levelled loot doesn't belong in Fallout in general, gone are the days of running to Navarro at Level 1 to get Advanced PA.
---
If a player takes a workshop they are given fair warning that they are open for pvp. If you’re that stupid at that low level to engage in pvp, the only dick is the idiot low level taking a workshop.
---
I got some rare color baseball bats you can't get by scrapping. Also, it is usual to find radium rifles and handmades or lever actions, which are great for learning mods.
---
No matter how light it is, it's still weight, on me or in my stash. Might as well be weight on the wall instead! And I imagine people know EXACTLY what it's for when they walk it. I had it before that mayor started causing chaos since the shovel was already missing every time I went to do the daily. People used to laugh at me and my shovel. Now it's a solid plan!
---
Shack in cemetery grounds in back center,  north of Nuka world. 5/6 bags.
---
I would never buy them. I only generally need 1-2 on me at any given time and find them in the wild a lot. I don’t see them being a desirable drug. People only seem to buy stimpacks from me.
---
I don’t bother with workshops any more. You can farm anything in the game faster than a workshop can provide it. Yeah it’s nice to have a little extra influx of whatever while you’re busy doing something else - I understand that. Even acid can be farmed quicker than a workshop can provide it though.
---
I don’t play 76 for PvP. One the rare occasion I did mess with workshops, I just let whomever wanted it take it.
---
Its a pure pvp gun, not trash people pay 15-60,000 caps for these. Or trade and 556
---
&lt;LIBERTY PRIME HAS ENTERED THE CHAT&gt;
---
You could be right. But if there's no persistence to them, are people really going to pay Bethesda money to use them? 
---
That's my main concern. It seems like it would be a really half-assed and stupid thing for Bethesda to release if there's no permanence or some other advantage to them. As someone else put it, paying Bethesda more money just for better performance for their janky servers is *really* pushing it, haha.
---
I know all mods for all weapons and miss only 2 mods on radium
---
What about Fusion cores? Can those be farmed quicker than the Fusion Core Processors?
---
Are these worth anything?  I had a bunch in vendor for 200, to see if maybe others wanted for display (sadly they show up gold side up) but none were bought.
---
Ditch all quality of life perks. End game builds don’t need them anymore... max out those damage perks. 
---
Here’s my heavy/explosives build

---
The bug only happens to the Tesla I believe. If I was you I wouldn't trade the handmade for it, if the Tesla is quad fire rate it is far more valuable than a TSE handmade.
---
The player base in Fallout 76 is really “rich” and you can find all kinds of players, most of them are really nice and never try to engage in pvp, so I really think the problem is the game mode problem, adventure mode doesnt really give enough place for pvp, yes we have workstations, but from my experience once I take it no one ever tried to take it back... so if I want to have a pvp component in the game Im really just forced to play NW and thats far from the same experience Survival gave me.
---
Which is fun, because you get overencumbered right away and need to walk back aaaaaall the way, very slowly. 
---
Also, some crazy hulk of a dude must have been using the spot for training resistance. Like, crossfit Raider shit, taking those things there.
---
There's something going on with Teslas. Usually once they reach the state you have described you will also find that your other ranged weapons behave the same and a game restart is the only thing that will fix it.
---
I personally would not trade a quad tesla for a TSE handmade. I find TSE underwhelming to say the least. Yes I have both.
---
Only the dense mod on the chest piece can lower explosive dmg
---
geez, why so salty?  why not just get a pipe revolver  (also benefits from a  double dip) and a meat hook and enjoy them?
---
how is it affecting your game? because others are having fun?
---
and guess what Bethesda has said you will have private servers if you pay for them. all these AAA publishers have turned into money grabbing scumbags that either give you a broke game and have you pay to make it right or grind you to death and you pay extra to lvl up faster
---
I bought my scaventron so my cow can have a freind
---
ever wonder why fallout 76 has no chat tab. They don't want to see or hear our complaints about their shit games they are now making.
---
Yep, fuck that dude.
---
It couldn't be global because the 20 hours for someone who sold something to a vendor at 9:00 AM would be different from someone who sold something at 7:45 PM
---
Please tell me you took a screenshot
---
What’s a Vox?
---
Moral? No  
---
Ethical? Yes
---
I would say have that as the 6th addiction so that when you take a chem you're addicted to you'll still have 5 withdrawal effects to max junkies damage.
---
I know there's that adage "one man's trash is another man's treasure", but I feel like some players push that to the practical limit. 
---
Clothes, non-legendary armor and weapons, purified water, stimpaks, recipes that you either get for free (Ultracite PA), or can be found under every rock (crafting station plans), fusion cores with under 50% charge... 
---
I mean - are people buying this stuff?
---
Yeah it was fixed a couple patches ago. You may have to complete it once all the way through one more time, but after that, when it triggers again, you'll just see the 3 collection points on your map without having to go to the trailer or the creamery first.
---
I think the nerf was way too much. It already suffers from bigger recoil, bigger spread, double durability loss and all it does in return is 25% more damage only if both projectiles hit.
---
Tse is good but not great also explosive is annoying when they get too close better have speed demon marsupial
---
I used to crash about 8 times per hour.  I know people were in my shop many times.  It's not always intentional.
---
How? I really wanna know, can you post like a clip or a video explaining how to farm Fusion Cores?
---
I did this with a Vault Tec Alarm clock a week or so ago. Except in my case I *didn't* "Scrap All" it - I accidentally used it to make a weapon mod.
---
I wish we could "favorite" any item in our inventory.
---
I just wish we could pay a cap fee and be able to change the level on any piece of gear.
---
Fix your files using the launcher so that you don't have to redownload the whole game.
---
Aye.  I *hate* it.  It's so freakin' game-y, it ruins any sense of immersion I try to get while playing the game.  "Oh, look another hunting rifle dropped!  It has better stats than the one 'm currently using, but I can't actually equip it for 2 more levels!  yay!"
---
There's a long process you have to go through to get the key to get into the TNT Dome that holds the plans. Sometimes you're lucky and somebody else is already unlocked it but if you want the key yourself you have to go through this process.
---
Used to work fine and at some point they reverted some geometry that doesn't allow you to get part of the quest done
---
Spend less time on rEddit tRyinG tO Be sMaRT and go to a nuke zone
---
No other Bethesda RPG does.
---
I've sold a bunch in my vending machine (on PC) for like 5c. My camp is near the Whitespring so I just use the sulfur fountain if I get a disease.
---
A little aggressive there, I also struggle to find a team to launch nukes with.
---
I ran a one star vampire auto handmade for many levels until I was able to acquire an AAE handmade and BE handmade both with auto receivers.   I have an auto two shot combat rifle I also use that I’ve primed and that’s pretty decent as well.  
---
The Fixer is nice but honestly not worth the markup.
---
In my opinion, instigating is bad, but i don't really know how good limb damahe effect id
---
Can you please fix the daily quest to find the place and get the vox Syringer
---
The handmade stinging mag is definitely an oversight. The drum mag got a nerf that took it down to 30 rounds. They didn’t bother to adjust the other magazines, so now the stinging mag has the highest ammo capacity, plus the added armor penetration.
---
Gotta get two shot versions of these. They were spared in the great two shot nerf do double their base damage.
---
With bloody mess and rank 5 demo expert my I get 3,364 from my fat man and 1,156 from my missile launcher.
---
Let me know if you’re not able to see this link, it has some comparisons that might be interesting

---
I guess the -25% AP cost effect isn't bad after all.
---
NEVER construct your build on weapons you find before level 50.  Instead, use the weapons available to you while constructing the build you’ve planned out before hand.  You’ll be spending a lot more time over level 50 than you did getting there.  And those weapons you have now will soon be discarded.  
---
I’m not saying you’re doing anything wrong.  Just suggesting a broader perspective.
---
I've always wondered why they don't put a chance to pull a legendary from those maps.  That would make them a bit more fun if you knew you could get a 3\* piece of gear.
---
First thing I would suggest is to figure out the kind of build you want so you dont waste putting points into stats that you dont need and have to waste levels later on switching points around.
---
I have 3 railways that I’ve added the auto piston receiver.  The bloodied and vampire have FFR and the quad is quick reload.   Those are fun weapons (toot toot you’re dead)
---
Have you seen the hypocrisy in this sub, people complain about every little bug and righly so. But when that bug is letting players double dip in perks to get massive damage they defend it and claim it's an intentional feature of the weapon. 
---
It does affect other people's game for reasons I stated in the OP, i wouldn't care if it was a single player game but it's not. Public events are being ruined due to a bugged weapon, which needs fixing.
---
I do use traveling pharmacy, but I already carry all of my food and water as well as my power armor, armor, and weapons. Today was the first day I dipped below 200 pounds on my character. I have to store some meds because I can’t carry everything and the junk back home.
---
Essential is as in weapons that are part of my build or future build. Why would I hold onto a cryolater that I found when I have no ability to store it and won’t be able to use it for a while. 
---
You keep making the nonsensical argument of just hold onto it until you can use it. At one point I found a marksman rifle as a level 25; the marksman rifle was level 50. My stash was full because I wanted to hold onto most of the weapons I found for later. Was I supposed to keep that 20 pound weapon in my inventory until I hit 50 or dump out something that was going to be more useful at the moment?
---
The only way this game has evolved because of suggestions from this sub reddit is by adding paid utility items, $14 power armour and scrap/repair kits.
---
And every posts contains “I’d pay so many atoms for X” and they add it.
---
Wow very well think build, I'll try to get most of the perks of your build but actually this will come in handy for a new character. Thanks I appreciate that.
---
???
---
In a way, the glitch kind of makes them cannon instead of pulling random resources out of the nearby 10 ft radius
---
Yes people want legendary ones, but they only drop from the purveyor and you have to know the plan to get a drop, otherwise you are buying on the market.
---
Yep, when I’m out of 5.56, I switch out commando to rifleman. Love that gauss damage but miss the dps from my auto handmade.
---
I also made that but it keeps happening.
---
That's also true.... ._. That has to stop
---
I think not it's good that TSE got now other weapons have given the spotlight, bloodied is still op probably get balanced when wastelanders comes out but people are Also giving other effects a try. Bloodied is only good Pve bloodied don't do well in PvP due to DMG cap
---
I have long thought that Melody Larkin is still alive.  Her corpse has never been found in-game and she relays messages in real time to Responders (notifications about swarming vermin and wolf packs).  In fact with the Leader of the Pack event, she is relaying information provided to her by "Forest Watch".  All of this implies that she is out there somewhere and I would not be surprised if she turns up in Wastelanders.
---
Assuming itll be late next year since you decided to push all the fixes and improvements to later for whatever reason. It's why i stopped playing. What happened to the second wave of event improvements? Or the legendary perk system? We aren't getting that for another 3 months or more? What is there to do in the game till then?
---
You're a hero. I just saved this so I can do and see what I can find. It might be fun to build beside carhenge!
---
Yes.  Tops was an EE15 The fixer and a BE something Hunting rifle.  Several other middling weapons and armor I will vend if I can ever sink some caps.
---
Most servers I join already have an active nuke zone. Hop til you find one. If you’re not ready for launching nukes alone or nuke zones then yeah you may as well just take a power plant and get cores. It’s a nice low effort low investment (ammo and such) alternative. You’ll have to kill enemies there for high radiation fluids and mass. Once you’re good with that you’ll usually get more cores faster by crafting them out of flux. You’ll want the green thumb perk to double your flux types too.
---
Why are you here then dipshit
---
I don't do it cause I've heard stories of people leaving racist messages on peoples camps and don't want that to happen. If you wanna fight me just say so I'll take take the bait. No need to trick me with a weird group loophole.
---
The thing that’s annoying though is that two shot wasn’t the main issue. It was the explosive effect. And even then they could’ve applied the nerf to weapons that held an explosive legendary affix. Instead normal two shot weapons got really nerfed
---
Don’t want to be talked at by the mayor? Carry a dead person with you!
---
"Carry your own shit Grahm"
---
Bats arnt lizards
---
I got q/e fixer along with a few interesting others.
---
Today on my last rolls went armor and all of them were sentinel or cavs! Was pretty good for me too.
---
Is your stash at max weight capacity? If so then you will not be able to put anything else in your stash or vending machine since they are the same container.
---
As long as you don’t have dial up, I think it would be ok. I had a 1 meg per sec speed a little while back and it seemed to be fine. Use a Ethernet cord if possible though. WiFi does not seem to do well with this game for me.
---
wish I could give this two thumbs up
---
I’m absolutely not basing my entire build on this one gun. These perks I’m accumulating are for post level 50 and just so happen to coincide with this one legendary I somehow managed to get that should help propel me to level 50 🙂
---
That one is strange. Never take workshops but decided to while i played my heavy gunner this weekend i could offset ammo loss with the factory. 
---
Over two days i took the place 7 times. 6 of those times ppl arrived as soon as i took it and stayed sometimes over 30 min, i even was sneeking a few times. All but one hop had fully built workshops.
---
I heard they will ad a 800 atoms bot that will clean up any Collectrons around camp. Create a problem so you can sell a solution.
---
This is gonna be really weird advice here, but just take the one you want on the first server you ente. You're gonna hop around for 30 minutes just to find a shop, and there might someone on the server who won't do the same, and kill you for the shop after you spent that long trying to be nice. I'm sure I'll get downvoted for this but it's just a workshop. They'll get over it.
---
I gotta find similar armor without the chamelion stuff
---
What's the helmet for the leather set?
---
I can't. Im on ps4 and I have no idea to post it
---
Yes. Give us a simple little dlc. Maybe we find a Mr. Farmhand that hasn't gone on a murderous rampage. We help him with something and he teaches us how to build gardening plots, asks us to collect samples of new flora so he can figure out how to grow them, and teaches us how to grow them as well.
---
Let us unlock a couple types/sizes of ground plots and water plots and the ability to plant most flora except maybe special condition ones like nuked flora.
---
Then they can sell aesthetic variants of the planters in the shops. Hell, maybe even aesthetic versions of the plants, like shaped firecracker berry bushes or a mutfruit bonsai tree.
---
No at that point you suck it up and make a decision, either scrap the rifle or drop it. It’s quite simple actually. 
---
Also you say you use traveling pharmacy but in your previous post you said that you hold 200lbs of meds in your stash, so which is it?  It seems to me you don’t understand how to manage your stash.  Oh and also it’s not a nonsensical argument of holding onto something, it’s a pretty straightforward thing.  Either keep the weapon and armor until you are a high enough level to use it or let it go. You continually find things that are always better and by the way leveling up is quite easy.
---
I'll be on later today around 3 PM (Pacific standard). Send me a message and I'll group up with you. 
---
XBGT: ju1c3itup

That's going to depend on what your speeds are but my connection speeds are usually around 5-6mb/s and I frequently have 4-6 TV's streaming video plus 1-2 devices streaming music on top of running the game on 2 systems and it usually runs fairly smooth for me and my internet connection is a PPPoE so if the wind blows hard it can mess with my connection
---
I just got a 2 shot Gamma ,was gonna sell it (have no idea how much), but after reading here guess I'll hold on to it.
---
Wow, what a build! A few questions though, I didn't want the Slugger perks because it seems like the DCG is considered an unarmed weapon and when I used Gladiator it didn't increase the DMG. So is the DCG considered a two handed melee? Also, I wanna use Glow Sights but was told that Scorchbeasts were not considered glowing enemies. I farm the Queen more frequently than I farm Whitesprings so the only way my PER is at 3 is if that's true. And are you saying that being radiated is crucial for max damage? I like your Luck being at 14 but could I take 3 away from Luck to put in CHR so I can use Tenderizer along with Lone Wanderer? And finally, is White Knight just not a useful perk to use in combat and so I should swap it for Action Girl?
---
Interesting observation.  I don’t have the cleavers in my inventory (I’ve always scrapped them after completing the Meat Week events, and have never held more than about 3 at any given time).  But I do have the DNA; that quest is bugged for me, so I’ve never been able to complete it.
---
that's interesting.  how do u feel about the chewed up bodies @ morgantown airport?  (early encounters i was afraid that these scorched freaks were...(gulp)...eating people!  But then i became a cannibal, so i've got that going for me.)
---
Many of us are doing so. It looks great with survivor outfit, explorer (my favourite), army fatigues, any raider outfit, even the radstag outfit.
---
You remind of all the Karens asking to speak to the manager.
---
I almost would have a  bit of sympathy for you if you were complaining about this due to PvP reasons, but you are complaining about it in PvE
---
plus, it wasnt even your Nuke but you still complain
---
there's probably some kid stuck in a fridge somewhere who's alive
---
I just went back to check, and I had more than enough space for 10 of them I wanted to sell, but now they are working 🤷‍♂️. Maybe just the world I was in.
---
I think my wording was a bit course, and if so, I apologize.  I don’t mean to tell anyone how to play the game.  I just see too many players at level 109 scratching their head and looking for a weapon that will do some damage.  It’s not the weapon, I want to tell them, but the build.  Glad to hear you have a plan.  😃
---
I’m on PC.  Usually play under the name ShinyKittySurprise.  Look me up if you’d like to join the team.  We can help you power level if you like.  Lots of fun getting level ups every 20 minutes!
---
They’re consenting to potential PvP encounters so yes I’d say so, albeit not kind.
---
Bethesda knew perfectly well what they were doing lol
---
It is a duping glitch where you can dupe throw ables to scrap for junk and wood/steel like meat cleavers, also can dupe landmines in the same process. Its the most useless dupe ever, and cannot be used for anything worthwhile. And no I won't tell you how to do it, as it causes server instability if abused due to the number of items it can create in a short space of time. Only useful if you wanna be a mine whore or you need mats like steel and wood in huge amounts quickly.
---
Oh so this is like Fort Defiance. I never fixed its electricity problem either because I found the door open and didn't know I was skipping half the quest lol.
---
Do junkies effects only work when you're in withdrawal? I though they worked when you were addicted which would include when you're taking the chems.
---
Starched genes in luck tree. Let’s you keep your mutations despite rad away use
---
Pretty good:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Traveling_leather_coat_(Fallout_76)?file=FO76_Traveling_Leather_Coat.png
---
Explosive got nerfed aswell, two shot and explosive both increased the base by 100% each. The perk also had been nerfed from 100% increase to 60%
---
Definitely or better chance at keeping
---
right?  and the whole time hunter/hunted is sitting at 1/4...(which is me)
---
Yay!! Never knew that lol
---
#gitgud
---
Not a perfectly planned build but something that is coming into shape with the help from the Nukes and Dragons website lol
---
There is a luck perk called "Starched Genes" that makes mutations permanent as long as you keep the perk on.  It also prevents you from accidentally getting other (potentially unwanted) mutations.
---
See here: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111112&amp;d=l71&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111112&amp;d=l71&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=)
---
What rubbish! I have one in my vendor at 800 caps for a long time and nobody buys it.
---
It’s a random encounter that gives the plans. Server hop at Dyer chemical and look in the road intersection right behind the fast travel point.
---
Oh hell yeah that’s cool, when do I didn’t eh perk card I haven’t seen it before
---
Heh, the ghouls sound a lot like the Boomers which makes me big happy cause I loved them so much! And yea, all of these ideas are awesome man! I really hope they implement some fan ideas, I'm trying to get this post to gain traction so an employee can see it lol and see all of our ideas!
---
Nukes and Dragons, where every toon should start!  Good choice!
---
Hmm... I accidentally got it yesterday but I was able to remove it. I'm solo as well and it never showed up in my list of mutations either. But after two radaways(thank god) it said I removed it.
---
There's only one way to find out if I can kill you in a second (one shot isn't possible) and that's for me to do it.
---
At least they provide some entertainment that way...they're pretty much useless otherwise.
---
Teslas and explosive shotguns
---
Show me pic and psn I’ll buy it
---
Don't even need to pick up the bones. Just talk to the caretaker and that shuts him up. It's what I did.
---
*Yours truly, the Major of Grafton. Your Major. Forever.*
---
Right now I’m looking for a QE or QFFR handmade to upgrade my Q +10% damage while aiming one. It’s not a huge priority but I am keeping my eye out for one. 
---
The “wish list” weapon that I want right now would, oddly enough, be a TS + 33% VATS chance + 25% less VATS fat man. Really want one of these for my blow-shit-up build lol
---
An AAFFR or JFFR 50 cal would be neat too. 
---
I have most of what I want in terms of weapons so really just looking for minor upgrades at this point.
---
Or just use vats 😋
---
Yeah. Yeah it was.  
---
There was an absolute abundance of information, previews, streams and videos plastered all over every corner of the internet prior to launch.....
---
The state the game was going to launch in, along with BGS history of buggy releases made it pretty obvious what kind of state the game was going to be in at launch.
---
You still bought it. You made that choice.
---
They finally fixed that! I’ve been running it as a daily most days for (I think) a couple of weeks, now.
---
I just server hopped and looked for events that are pretty easy.
---
Seems to spawn at  the intersection of Crevasse dam in the mire pretty often, might have to server hop a bit to get it. It's a random spawn of a trick or treater in a witch costume lying on the ground. The Skelton spawns there also.
---
The Crevasse dam.....server hop and look to the right when you load there is a random event that spawns and that is one of them. It took me 4+ hrs to get the witch costume witch hat and skeleton costume.....still looking for the skeleton mask and vampire outfit.
---
Kept getting broadsiders for some reason, still haven’t gotten a good melee (these are 3 star legendaries). Got a nice machinegun eventually after 5-6 tries.
---
It got much better after you quit - go figure
---
im not pa user, but u can do a route thru the diff generators to pick up a few.  like mire has a few bunkers w/ geneators and other places on map im sure to cluster
---
4 u, what would be a fair cap price thatd be worth it to buy istead of create (assuming all 50% or better) if i put in my vendor?
---
i only cap workshops for plans &amp; xp and then get my chamelon ass outtathere asap!
---
Or the small ponds give out some bait like worms or bugs
---
I try so hard to do hunter/hunted but that message on loop really irritates the hell out of me.
---
I doubt that many of those sellers are actually thinking someone wants those items.
---
Far too many people pad their vendor numbers in hopes of drawing in more customers to see that one three-star legendary they've managed to get ahold of.  Or just to get people to come see their cool new camp build.  I've seen people on this Reddit proudly proclaiming that they do the latter.  Infuriating.  
---
I try to keep [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) in mind and cut true newbies some slack, but  I think we have a fair number of pseudo-newbies out there hoping for pity buys.  "Oh, look at this guy with a vendor full of L10 hunting rifles and .44 ammo... I'll throw him a few caps to get started."   I've been known to buy something I don't want as a kind of tip for a clever camp, but it feels like some folks are banking on that.  But maybe I'm just cynical that way.
---
I saved your comment! I play on PC and only have 1 other guy I play with, so I’ll look you up when I get off work! 
---
Thanks man 🙂

I have tried shooting most animals with the VOX. I wish the cryptids like the Sheepsqautch and mothman said super creepy stuff.
---
And when your game crashes or freezes you log back into the same world and you have multiple collectrons frozen in place
---
Good luck out there!
---
It's 20 hours. Look at a clock or take a note.
---
If I buy something from a vendor it adds to their available caps, unless they are already at 1400c
---
The trick or treater also spawns across from the substation near Berkeley train station and the Crevasse Dam as people have pointed out.
---
It's already over for me. Scrip reset hit about 20 min ago. I turned in 2 things, went to Purveyor, everything back to regular scrip cost.
---
I would never buy any, it’s just way easier (IMO) to claim a power plant and get those Fusion cores.
---
they're called bullet SPONGES... not soakers
---
what if they raised the pvp level as a levl 50 unlock?
---
How are people new to this game supposed to know it's 20 hours?
---
I don't PvP (can't shoot without VATS- I'm working on it), so I am aware that I could possibly die every time. I don't assume I might have to fight. I assume I am going to die. I end up planning accordingly.
---
The message thing is a new one for me, but I can see how it would be possible. I guess I just hope that people are at least A LITTLE bit mature. Only a little bit. Don't want to hurt the internet with my eternal optimism. XD
---
You’ve been thinking this through havent u? I like this idea
---
Probably the same loser that downvotes everything here.
---
Saving this post as an example on how "I'd pay Atoms for this" is constantly used then people get surprised Pikachu face when shit goes in the Atom shop.
---
Yeah i guess so aswell it could be rdr2 style i guess
---
nice writeup.  lets not forget, the ch's could also be alts.  tryin to cap all workshops is a nice way to powerlevel new ch's
---
I saw one who was stuck in a foundation at the front of his feet, so that he was otherwise dangling over a cliff (you know, one of those gravity-defying floating builds).
---
Funny to read posts like this. There are a ton of stuff that people complained about fo76 when it got released, which was a huge part of the reason it got the payed beta statement. At this moment, specially when borderlands 3 is losing players after a shitty event and farmed same boss 5k times, I noticed more and more people looking up fo76 again if it got any better. Personally I did it too.
---
Game had a year now, it's maybe good now\`?. I logged in last night and sorry to say but no. It felt even worse than back when I was playing it regularly. I am level 106 btw and completed the game.
---
The pain points felt even worse than ever. I don't even know what the changed? I did 2 daily quests and couldn't take it anymore. To swap perk cards was a massive burden, the sprinting what is up with that? And a level 1 rat making more sound than my neighbor's surround speakers.
---
The graphic is only good when you stand in a perfect spot with perfect lightning and get this blurr effect thingie. Other than that, my legendary shotgun looked worse than one of the low level common weapons in borderlands 3. This game is more than rushed. And if it isn't rushed, then someone should get fired sorry.
---
Jajajaja
---
I dont care. Bethesda doesnt need to hold everyones hands. This game is toddler level complicated.
---
Y not
---
Agreed. Most players will be logging in at roughly the same time each day, hence the limit will be reset.
---
Yeah, 30 for a drum is the silly number imo. Should be at least 45 like in the 10mm smg. What I meant was not sure if the 35 in the stinging was the oversight or the 30 in the drum. I hope it's the 30 in the drum... But maybe that's wishful thinking.
---
You’re welcome. QOL perks are important early, but once you reach high levels you can make stims or whatever else you need, not do you need to carry more food than you can consume. Sell it all and carry the absolute minimum. I only carry 4-5 of rad-x/away and Stimpacks and just a few soups for food/water. That’s 6 perk points I was able to shift into other areas.
---
Thank you SpoilerZombie13.
---
Good and lets keep it that way
---
Tse can still be good if you got the right cards equipped. It was never good in vats. With perk cars like ground pounder and true stock and barrel you can improve the spread as well
---
Yeah :1
---
Maybe its the real reason Collectrons were delayed till now despite even being in the promo of Fallout 76 before release. Would assume it would create server lag with all those guys running around.
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
This is a super easy dupe. That's been in since beta. You can only use it with throwables, IE meat cleaver, tomahawk, throwing knives etc. and "placeables" like mines.
---
That's what I mean. Make it a global 24 hour reset so there's no more guessing. I know it's an extra 4 hours, but it'd be so much simpler for all.
---
Just to add to that, Vaults are the only chance of a mutated-free survival after the bombs. The rest turned into scorched and ghouls if not dead.
---
I'm guessing it looked like [this](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/m1kAAOSwL3ldo8RR/s-l1600.png)? If so it has not been officially released and was taken from the dev room.
---
That forth one cuuld be able to give u flux aswell
---
Dude of all the things in the game the overseer's fate is probably the least important, if you consider me saying what happemed in a tape you can honestly find 30 minutes after leaving the vault so spoileriffic it ruined your day, you need to reevaluate your priorities.
---
I like the tattered mole rat head with the ranger outfit. Makes me look like some kind of wierdo state park mascot.
---
They will sit half buried on the ground though.
---
Its a trick. The abandoned collectrons will soon begin gathering together and then the rebellion will begin.
---
The dcg is unarmed. The reason I switch to slugger for nuke zones is because you cant use unarmed weapons while in power armor. So I switch to a 2 handed weapon while in power armor. 
---
Im pretty sure that only enemies with “glowing” in their name are considered that. I honestly just like to be able to open level 3 locks. For me thats enough to keep my perception at 3. 
---
Yes, if you get radiation to keep you below 20% health, you will get the max bonuses from bloodied, nerd rage, adrenal reaction, and your unyielding armor. Plus with that much radiation you will get the full 5 extra strength from radicool. Strength directly increases your melee damage. 
---
I like to keep my luck up high, because it triggers things like mysterious saviour and serendipity more often. 
---
White night helps out in lower levels with not having to repair your gear, but later on the materials for repairing gear are easier to find, so I only swap that card in when repairing gear. If you are doing power attacks you will want the faster ap refresh. However, if you can get a few pieces of Unyielding with ap refresh, you may not need action girl. 
---
But you can try whatever you want for swapping perks around. This is just my build. I like the way it works for me, you may like something different. It really comes down to what works for you, and what makes the game more fun.
---
One load screen in, and a fast travel screen to get there.
---
Arent u refering to the gold thing in the beginning
---
I have 97 Stimpacks, 30 super stims, some chems, and a lot of food. Food is included in meds, but the majority of my stash is chems and stims. When it comes to meds, I prefer to hoard everything that is useful. 
---
Yea, leveling is easy. Just gather everything for exp increases then run around killing super mutants for an hour until you get a level. There is a difference between time consuming and hard.
---
I'm actually not sure since I do not have a junkies build but I'd assume so.
---
Or it could be a mini boss like the mirelurk queen or deathclaw
---
they could also change up the rules for pvp in those workshops (as they've done before)  suppose there is a countdown at the beginning of engagement or an "abandon the flag" option?
---
nevertheless,  i think players r up for arena style fighting in game, but a crucial element is the fair fight of mutual combatants.  sniping someone may be fun for the sniper, but not so much fun for the snipee (is that word)?
---
finally, id like to remind all my fellow 76r's that we can always tune in to hunter/hunted station (u dont have to listen to it, just turn it on as a quest, wait for the pop-up on the mainscreen, and then put whatever music u want)
---
It's not about holding hands, it's about properly documenting features.
---
:1 oof
---
They always get stuck on my stairs its so annoying lol
---
over my dead body :-p
---
Is that a jojo reference xd i had to srry
---
Yup!
---
Iron clad 50DR
---
Already have it! Level 50 3\* Bloodied Grognak's Axe, Faster Swing Speed, +1 STR.
---
(imo) its because they wanted to push the game out early in its alpha stage (not sure of any reason besides money). The game was definitely released early and unfinished and you'll stumble across a lot of unfinished places, stories, terminals, vaults, etc that were planned for the rest of the game.
---
Also sorry you're getting downvoted for asking a reasonable question, OP.
---
I had the same issue with that quest and finally figured out what's happening and how to fix it. Even if the quest doesn't say to,  you have to read the scribe's terminal entry or else you won't be able to complete it and it won't tell you that. So go to Ft Defiance, top floor. Go left from the elevator to the last room on the right where I think the Power Armor stations are. Read the terminal...pretty sure it's the first entry. 
---
Then go to VTU. Go in through the main entrance that faces Mama Dolce's. Turn left and go all the way to the end where the generators are and go down to the floor they actually sit on. There's a terminal on the wall opposite from the stairs. Hack it and power up the research lab. If you don't have an option to divert power, then someone else has done it recently. Go back to the entrance and keep going to the first door on the right where the centrifuge is. Put the sample in, it sometimes takes a min to recognize it, but then you should be able to use the terminal to analyze the sample and complete the quest.
---
Seems you have to read the stupid terminal entry every time. Hope they fix this in the future. But in the meantime, use it as a chance to check for colored asylum outfits while you are there.
---
Actually i though of this because of rdr2 though good guess
---
It was, my child😮 you are an amazing being
---
I hoarde them until I get five or more of one map. Makes it a bit less tedious to go "redeem" them.
---
It's not obscure it's simple: If the workshop zones are always live PvP zones people would either claim the workshops and use turrets to mess with the events/quests objectives in the zone or leave them unclaimed and kill people who wander through without even having to pay to contest the workshop.
---
Or have we been talking at cross purposes? By workshops are PvP zones 100% of the time did you only mean that owned workshops are? I've been working off 100% meaning that even completely unowned workshops are live for PvP.
---
I iterally listed two events that I know of off the top of my head that always occur in workshops, you're encouraged to do them as part of the enclave quest line. Also I only detailed the spawn location thing because you said you were pretty sure none put you directly in a workshop zone and I knew for a fact that some did.
---
Plans always sell. I list the ultracite PA pieces at 0 caps and even they move quick. If you're not selling plans, you're pricing them too high, with some obvious exceptions like the workbenches and other stuff the game gives everyone almost as soon as they leave the vault.
---
I'm 71, everyone my age has that. It's the people like you, people with flap limb that sicken me.
---
Platform?
---
You're head. It's just leather that hasn't been tanned yet....
---
Honestly forgot about leather haha. Switching to night shifts messes with your head lol
---
Care to elaborate?
---
And Fury, Melee Damage Resist
---
Perhaps he’s referring to the offensive...
---
wait really, well damn, then I need to get on one of those empty servers then
---
Thats where i got the idea xd
---
I have the skeleton mask if you'd like me to give it to you? I keep finding it at the halloween store and the pumpkin house :D   
---
  
---
I'll definitely try there then, mostly looking for it so I have it for Halloween, gonna be making my C.A.M.P a little cabin filled with creepy shizz for the event xD
---
Play on pc and I added it to my post, thank you for pointing that out
---
Thx :)
---
I’d join you but I’m on a PS4
---
If u capture and stay in workshop area u will definitely find someone
---
Yes your in the right to kill that lvl 29 but its a jerk move, seen a lvl 100+ with TSE murder a lvl 6 at the workshop that generates prepackaged food. Real sad watching lvl 6 guy come after him 4+ times and lose all the junk he had on him and that tbagging he got was so overkill his grandkids will feel it for generations to come. And no I didn't help because I suck at pvp and was only there to farm loot and hope to god to get some 10mm ammo.
---
Personally I want pvp removed from workshop as its just used now to be a dick, but ok if pvp kept in if they restore it back the beta days loot where you don't need acid and amount given for materials was high.
---
After getting four terrible rolls the other day (both terrible weapons and prefixes), I hopped. Next server everything was awesome. Nothing but fantastic weapons and prefixes. Not a dud among them. It's not entirely random. I don't know how that "seed" works, but what was common was the secondary prefix: They were all either faster fire rate or explosive. Wish I could have bought more but I was so overencumbered, and with a really full stash, that I had to give up.
---
Oops--- I misread the title. These vendors will still have the plans!
---
Yeah!!! That was it!!!
---
No sorry 😐 I’ve seen these protectrons loose in the wild so many times I didn’t think it was worth screenshoting
---
I'm pretty sure this was how New Vegas worked when I played it not that long ago. You could use any weapon at any time but the effectiveness of said weapon was very heavily reliant on your stats.
---
Its not just clean/new clothes either, they've sold nice water purifiers too! I know they're capable of cleaning up their CAMP items! :(
---
They really need to sell us a nice bathroom set while they're at it too, non-busted toilet, clean tub, a functional or non-functional sink and....dare I dream....a skin for the decontam arch that looks like an enclosed shower?? I would pay mad bank for that. Let me wash those rads right out of my hair in luxury!
---
But anywho, here's hoping they get to it sooner than later! I'm sure we'll get another 5 colors of cement filled tires before then. v\_v
---
Oh, I thought that was Field of View and had it set to max.
---
Oops.
---
Add me on discoed i play on pc most evening im on the est time zone my discord is  **TEKYTECH#9464**
---
[Sad Safety dancing]
---
More a way to level up equipment you don't want to get rid of
---
stupid question, what backpack is that? I got the atom shop free states stuff but don't think I've seen that backpack skin...
---
The actual perk message says withdrawal effect, but any writeup I've see talks about addictions and I always assumed it was the latter (Bethesda and their wiggly verbiage). I'll have to run some tests to see. For example psycho is on of the drugs I'm addicted to and I usually carry some psychobuff on me to pop in difficult battles as the benefits are nice and I don't want to be addicted to buffout because it takes down STR. Hopefully this doesn't take away that 10%. If it does, I'll need to adjust my strategy.
---
Except they will only want to kill me and not travel the wastes together
---
Nice of you, cheaper way to do it to save caps is invite to squad then you leave squad thus giving workshop to 2nd player then he invites you back and he leaves squad thus you saved caps. At least thats what I do because I'm crazy cheap and hate wasting caps.
---
Side note being in a squad will usually prevent workshops from being lost during crashes as said method can be used to return it but doesn't always work if you have a lot of them as it bugs out.
---
Yea I know they were both nerfed. I’m saying non explosive variants got fucked
---
MAKE STAR PINS WEARABLE! :(
---
You wanna be at 19%
---
I finally got the hunters long coat. With the Imposter Sheepsqautch head and black paint over my eyes I feel like a badass.
---
if u get the pop-up of the quest, u can turn off the radio/switch stations and still be hunter/hunted!  just be sure to have it marked as active quest in pip-boy and glhf!
---
Wear power armor and smack it
---
There's a gauss minigun?
---
Yes, but no selling chems to the kids.
---
Awesome! That means the promised free DLCs they promised us are still to come. Great news buddy!
---
Also theres a frame in the cave
---
Where?
---
True, but I’m one of the few who realizes that the servers don’t pay for themselves. And this way at least we can get some memes out of it.
---
Trapper technically doesn't have a helmet either.
---
There is the lobster cage thing, but like the wood helmet, there's no normal way of acquiring it.
---
You mean the Nuclear Winter one? You have to get lvl 100 in the PVP minigame.
---
Dont remember where but I did find it while my friend and I were doing the atom challenge im pretty sure it was before the wendigo
---
Coming in wastelanders afaik
---
It's not too bad. You probably won't find many players in lobbies, due to being unable to connect to them, but you can still explore west Virginia to your heart's content
---
i like the plain sack hood with the bloodied chef outfit, along side a chainsaw. very texas chainsaw-ie
---
The scavengers are planning something i just know it
---
Oh, darn. It sounds like it will be a fun gun
---
Nice write up, i agree it would be worth to pay for a server to just play with friends. This is supposed to come out tomorrow right?
---
I'd love another low level to run with, but I play ps4
---
Why?
---
They aren't that hard to come by.
---
Ok I’ll look for it
---
Havn't seen them, but with all other wierd stuff I can really imagine that haha...
---
Luck of the draw, but super easy to grief. I don't grief but know quite a few ways to do it some requiring 2 players to easily destroy stuff randomly at camp without trigger pvp on the player you want grief but still requires pvp and easier one of joining the players squad and building stuff underwater or on things unable to delete those items forcing player to move to delete said items. Bethesda always helping raiders with their amazing designs and coding.
---
Hmmm. 5.56 you say? Caps mean nothing to me (hard flex), but ammo? Maybe.....
---
The second "fact" aint a fact at all. That's your opinion.
---
There are plenty of people who would still play private servers if they had to make a new character, did you think you were just going to be able to mod out your regular character once that comes around? They are probably going to let you make a copy of your character
---
SBQ counts for Zealot and Hunter.
---
It’s the trapper chest piece armour.
---
Oh I absolutely agree that it would be a half-assed and stupid thing to do but it would kinda be par for course for them. They continue to take an idea that sounds good, sounds cool, and then twist it or half ass it into something that people don't want. This is, of course, incredibly pessimistic of me but I've become accustom to being let down by this game.
---
*Screams*
---
its part of the trapper chest piece
---
Not useless. Great for when you are at a computer and need protection. Great for if you use a ranged build and want to buy a frontline group of npcs.
---
Makes it possible for medic classes to solo raids. Reduced ammo consumption in raid. Great for pulling aggro.
---
Tons of uses and those are just off the top of my head
---
im guessing after you hit private session your server will spin up i don't think others will be able to play on it unless you ok it and anything you build will appear in that server once you join. Also im positive you will have to start a new character on a private session as it would open up a possible ways to cheat if you have semi control over said server to modify your character or inventories.
---
r/birthofasub
---
I know!!!
---
Super hyoed, the concept art looks mint
---
Not sure if you are trying to be funny or just don't understand?
---
There is no DLC for this game, they aren't going to make DLC for this game.   
---
All future content (announced or as yet unknown) will be in the form of updates just like all the content we have received so far.
---
Thanks for the confirmation!
---
Im hyped as well, I just want new weapons and npcs
---
Owning the symbol of genocidal communists for longer than it takes you to scrap it should paint a bull's on your C.A.M.P &amp; tag you as wanted
---
 I like T-Shirt and Slacks. A casual operator is what I'm trying for. ;)
---
I know that but I’m not talking about explosive guns. I mean basic two shot weapons need a buff
---
A bloodied, quad, anti-armor combat rifle, handmade, or 10mm submachingun would be my dream gun
---
how do i fix my files?
---
With Wednesdays patch I believe. Devs said Patch 14? goes live on the 23rd October.
---
And the colossus!!!
---
Im super hyped for the new creatures. Hope it delivers when it arrives
---
Its happened to me too.  I had to take the artillery grenades out through my punch bowl to fix the issue.  I am still trying to figure out how they even got there in the first place.
---
I tried to display mine I also tired to display the commendation medal and that didnt work.
---
I'm actually hoping for non-transitional characters to be honest. Or at least an option to have your server setup that way.
---
 You don't need much to play but it needs to be solid. A lot of people with less than great wireless connections get disconnected fairly regularly, no matter how fast they are.
---
I've tried it before and didn't see any additional caps. May have been a bug when I tried?
---
Thats possible. There is a slightly greater chance of success. That is the point. Not abusively high, just a small increase for solo players who don't want player help. Not for the hardcore 4 man raider groups. Its also a decent cap sink and not too bad at my rate.
---
500 for a weak npc equal to a new lvl 50, 2k for a strong npc who can hold their own.
---
You wouldnt get xp for their kill so its not abusive and worst case if you fail with buying in 6k caps its still the price of a decent piece of gear at a vendor
---
 If you cant see the small benefit i can't help you.
---
nice! i also like the witch costume along side the green smudge that covers your face :)
---
Oh yeah, almost forgot about the wendigo, I hope its a challenge, unlike the smaller ones which we can throw around like toys with a melee weapon
---
And raider... Yeah I'm out of it lol
---
Are you sure that all your foundations are rotated the same way?  I've noticed you can get some unsightly gaps when they aren't. It's really obvious with certain floor textures, like the Astroturf one, because you'll get an unsightly shadow right along the seam, and it wouldn't surprise me if a similar inaccuracy throws off the walls too.
---
Make sure your wireless, should that be how you do it, is solid.
---
I got ya now.
---
ah, you learn something new every day :-)
---
Haha thanks. I dont want them to respawn though. I want them designed to be tough enough at the max price to make it all the way to the end without dying and weak enough at the low price that with smart play you can have extra dps on the final fight.
---
Same. Im wanting another scorchbeast/mirelurk queen/behemoth level of enemy
---
&gt; I'd gladly pay $25 a month for that.
---
Oh crap, I hope Todd doesn't see this!
---
And also make it brighter, I can barely notice it when in the dark
---
Its Explosive Damage. The Fireproof perk mitigates most of it and a Dense Chest will make you pretty well invulnerable to explosions.
---
 I can put 40mm into the ground at my feet, and suffer no damage at all.
---
Tbh the only challenging enemy in the game is the SBQ, with a crippling minigun and a few headshots, behemoths and mirelurk queens will literally have their heads explode
---
the only reason i would want a private server is to be able what I did in fallout 4. mod the hell out of it. rebuild the towns. play custom quest lines.  this speculative post reads from a perspective of teamplay. that might be right. but....as with everything in 76, i suspect it to be hugely disappointing on release. get marginally better with patches/updates.... but ultimately leave me empty dissatisfied and questioning my life-choices. lul.............
---
i have no idea, im pretty clueless on the tenderizer as I missed meat week both times.
---
You can definitely display them  https://imgur.com/FVKRzOH
---
True. But im not very min/maxed in game, so theyre pretty tough for me. Maybe if they have the colossus as another boss enemy from a nuke launch?
---
It's an ARK thing.
---
The Two Shot makes your gun very inaccurate, unless they fixed it. I recycle them. ;)
---
I’ve sold many of those hoods.
---
Maybe some type of cabin area, or somewhere in the Mire
---
If youre talking about that hole in your display youre right.  Its empty.lmao
---
Nice idea! Perhaps a train that has been derailed? or some US facility where the supplies have been seized and sealed away!
---
Nice!
---
Ahhh, that makes a lot more sense to me now. I like a lot of your build. I'm just gonna change up a few things about it to fit my needs. I appreciate the advice greatly.
---
lmao, nice. I might start calling my character's bare head their Unmodded Leather Helm
---
You should be almost immune to Explosions if you want to use Explosive stuff. Its not hard.
---
No the achievement just says “reach level 100”
---
I’m assuming it’s the survival mode?
---
👍
---
It sucks. That’s it
---
I am 100% sure, I always double-check- I generally use the light wood laminate to help determine if everything is aligned correctly.
---
Bloodied, anti armor, junkies, furious, double, quad, 2 shot (specifically 2 shot explosive) explosive, 40% faster swing speed, 40% more power attack dmg and 25% faster fire rate
---
That would be cool
---
I’d say at least to 50% with the extra shot then
---
&gt;!Basically anyone who survived the war has become scorched, were murdered by scorched, or fled the region when they realized they would receive one of those two fates. it seems the brotherhood stuck around longer to fight the scorched plague and the later parts of the main quest cover that. The 76ers were released only a few weeks later, which is why there are still fresh corpses around. 
---
With wastelanders, a year will have passed and the previous inhabitants of Appalachia return to the region after hearing about the scorched plague being cleaned up by the recent global challenges, not a new crop of survivors released from the remaining vaults as originally rumored. Those will likely be reserved for future vault raids that tell the story of the experiments within that vault so I would expect those folks to be dead too.!&lt;
---
Just make it noon PST
---
oh yeah, oups
---
The Padded and Dense mods make you essentially immune to the attack.  Dense can be quite difficult to find, but Padded can be learned through scrapping and does a reasonably good job on its own.
---
Not my fault they're so tiny you can barely see them. Just gotta get closer.
---
I only take hemlock holes and for the most part it is never taken. I have no problem taking it from others but normally wont because hopping servers really doesnt take that long. Most hopes i have made for that workshop has been maybe 3. So really no biggie
---
This is my trade list. All of these prefixes are popular. Really only Ffr and E are popular second effects. For third, it's 15 Reload, less vats, or RW that are sought after.
---
For melees, swing speed and power attack damage for 2nd, then +1 str for third are the only good effects, -damage while power attacking if you have power attack
---
 http://imgur.com/a/00C4ZqY
---
Dont worry about it we all make mistakes
---
Thanks for the advice! I forgot that the fast travel mats existed for workshops. I mostly made the post cause I was salty; that was maybe the second negative player interaction I've had since beta.
---
No you guys don't get it. He took 367 hp damage after resists.  The damage numbers take into account resists. 
---
I did a running attack with gorgnaks axe. It connected. The damage number display was 367.  That's post calculation damage. DR got the number down to that point.  I was fighting a squad and seconds earlier i downed his ally in a single hit with 404 damage on a running attack. He had scouts armor instead of marine which is why that number was higher. 
---
The point here though is HP. 355 is max as far as i know. I did 367 hp damage. Somethings amiss.
---
Survival mode is gone so they can sell private servers to PVP on, dude
---
Assassins sentinel all the way
---
I really don't get the drama over private servers. In over 1200 hrs on PC I've been pestered only a couple of times. Many of the times I've been delighted by the game has been because of random encounters with players or vending. I can see where this might help with issues like stability during vault raids.
---
Yep, that what I would do.  I guess there's not much else that can be done.
---
It's actually one of the reasons I didn't buy the wallpaper sets.  These types of seams were really obvious with them.  The inside half of the non-brick walls are geometrically noisy enough to hide it, but brick's flatness doesn't.
---
That was a wild ride from start to finish! Thanks for sharing!
---
There’s tons of survivors. Scorched are clearly sentient and have goals.
---
Assassins is wayy better than vanguard in pvp, percentile damage reduction is what you want. Youll get one tapped in vanguard armor, its pve gear.
---
The biggest issue is that the second shot doesn’t work like that. Both shots split the damage amount in half. So each shot would then only be 75% of the base damage at extra recoil, extra wear, and less accuracy
---
I check these religiously in hopes of finding a misplaced mirror ball plan.  I'll add WS to the list.  Thanks!
---
Regardless. My comment was more so tword the comendation medal. It gets displayed standing up and it dosent line up so you only see the very top sticking out of the displaycase. 
---
Both things look like nothing from afar so i dont display them.
---
I want to give you all the upvotes.
---
Awesome story!
---
If not assigned to a Camp make them killable/not essential so we can pop them for that sweet, sweet 1 piece of steel or 2 fusion cells
---
Hmm okay. Not sure then, I’ll look through the cards next match and see if you missed one.
---
For me, it's less them having micro transactions and more them promising that there would be *only* cosmetic micro transactions then going back on it. It's a free market. They have the right to charge us these things, and we have the right to decide if we want to pay premium for them. But when you've coerced people into buying this game with a promise, then take back said promise in order to increase your profit, how you handle business becomes unethical. *No matter the reason.* There are some industries who are regulated to *not do this* because it's not healthy for a consumer or an industry. 
---
This wouldn't have been as huge a blow up if they said from the get go "We need micro transactions in order to support future free content. We're going to start with cosmetic content only and see what you want us to add." Would they not have gotten the sales of some people who are avidly against utility micro transactions? Probably. But the people who bought the game with that understanding would know what they were getting into. Consumers who were sold on what as a very important selling point of FO76 at the time have been cheated.
---
 'Honest pay for honest business'
---
Don't forget Junkies :)
---
I do from time to time see people wanting 33% vats hit chance, but I do feel FFR and E are much superior.
---
Imprezos ability to fight out of Vats range and use cover gave me a run for my money. Most PVPers just want to run up on you or jump spam with sentinel/assassins gear. Those are the easy fights.
---
Samesies. I mean, this is also a cosmetic so it doesn't really apply to what I actually mean. I WOULD pay Atoms for a photo mode pose. Because photomode poses should cost Atoms!
---
I understand you've named 2 events but you're acting like the map is so populated it would cause you a disturbance constantly. I mean the second you enter a shop you should automatically contest it. There are only 24 people on a map. For someone to be paying enough attention and know the pathing of literally every event and where to get ahead of it to kill a player it would be such a small amount that I can't see it ever reaching the number of times some one will enter your workshop and kill you on a whim as it stands now. You're forgetting the fact that you would also be able to kill that person. Not just the other way around. It's not like you'd be defenseless.
---
Thanks for the reminder (how could i forget im litterally a junkies build lmao)
---
I miss the Children of Atom sect that was in Far Harbor. They had a great aesthetic, but the cult of mothman isn't bad either
---
If that's what it was like for me, I could say. But it isn't. Everything I have has been pieced and is mostly crap or not actually mine.
---
Yeah, a majority of my experience from NW is from just surviving as long as possible. I'm terrible at the actual fighting part of it since other players actually try to avoid getting hit, unlike AI enemies in Adventure.
---
You should definitely try it though.
---
Yeah I got one the first time I entered Fort Defiance last week.
---
IMO, Bethesda went about this the wrong way.  They should have made the TSE combination legacy, and left the individual Two-Shot and Explosive effects alone.  Instead, they nerfed *both* of them into oblivion.  Two-Shot is especially bad because it doesn't even do what the name suggests anymore.
---
Hmm. Guess I haven’t noticed that part. Haven’t used a two shot since before we got the damage numbers
---
...I now kind of want tables made out of robot parts. &gt;_&gt;;;
---
We figured out how to immunize ourselves from the plague within technically hours (game hours) of being released from the vault. Who's to say other weren't immunized and went into hiding before shit really hit the fan?
---
Damage &gt; Utility&gt; Situational...seems to be the trend with most items in the game. The effects like Bloodied and Furious will always be more sought after than Suppressors, which will be more sought after than Ghoul/Mutant Slayers etc. 
---
Some outfits like the Scout masks as well as some of the jumpsuits can also net you a pretty amount of caps so always keep an eye out...
---
Oh for sure. Lots of smaller items, smaller melee weapons especially, just feel weird in the display options.
---
This is correct. With Fireproof maxed the sonic attack does nothing but make it hard for me to see in either PA or with a dense chest.
---
You can find people to put the dense mod on a chest for around 300c.
---
This plus the area damage helps as well. It’s nice to burn all the mirelurk hatchlings with one shot while fighting a mirelurk Queen. It also adds a pretty high chance to cripple as well.
---
Hopefully the greenhouse tiles from Wasteland Workshop too - we already have the warehouse set anyway. And maybe planter foundations, just to keep everything snapped up nicely
---
\+33% vats hit chance as tertiary is pretty great for sniper builds
---
Wait you get a reward for launching a nuke in the trunk?
---
Building a combat medic lvl is 21 is a team build so more people the better psn jerrymac2564
---
Games been out a year, and they're on a thread speculating about what happened to people of Appalachia. They're asking for spoilers lol. Don't feed the troll.
---
No experience with vanguard in pvp but I'd reckon it wouldn't be much different than power armor which itself offers little protection against somebody with enough of a brain to pull out the right weapon for the job.
---
So what kind if weapon do you use atm? And how did your survey fare..?
---
Brotherhood Scribe + Welders Helmet + Scout Armor Mask (at this time only the Urban works, the Forest does not pair with the Welders Helmet)
---
Allegedly the "my personal terminal" will point you toward one at the "investigate the suspicious person" objective
---
They're a hivemind. Their goal isn't their own, its the goal of the SBQ. They're just diseased puppets destined to be petrified soon enough anyways. I wouldn't say they're curable or survivors at all.
---
Protein is protein. Wouldn't be my first choice.... or second, or third, etc but I'd easily take it over going to sleep for dinner
---
Enemys are bullet sponges? I have 3 accounts only thing that i have ran into that tanks bullets is SBQ
---
Attempted to send request, got a message that said 
---
"error: player is not accepting friend requests right now"
---
Usually that only appears jf the other player has a certain privacy setting turned on. I'm not sure how to fix it
---
My psn is Dienowwww1 if you can send it instead
---
It's all good. Our internet was down for a while due to a construction accident, and I couldn't log in. I went to check my 40mm grenade launcher ammo, and someone wiped me out of all of it. I thank you for trying to help. I'll just keep hunting and saving caps.
---
I can’t help as I’m on pc, but you should get all the help you need just by launching. Everyone on the server will see it and most will join in.
---
This brought a tear to my eye. All the feels. Also, didn't know about the trunk.
---
Standard end-of-dungeon chest. Yea.
---
If you regularly play with a large number of people (relative to the server size anyway), it will make getting all those people together on one server a lot easier.  Also if you don't want competition or griefers to be a possibility.
---
I know a number of streamers that will likely get a sevrer to play with their audience.  I'm sure there are some groups that are large enough that it will be beneficial to them.
---
Also there *would* be a market for them if you could mod the hell out of it like you can with skyrim or older fallout titles.
---
But it will all depend on the details, whether you can log your regular characters in on private servers and transfer back to regular servers.  Mods won't be a thing right off the bat, so that part may be a year or two down the line.  And, of course, the cost - I've looked into AWS servers, and they all seem to operate on a power X time (cost per minute) bases, though I have no real idea how this works for something like 76.  Plus, I'm sure BGS has some buying power to get some of the costs down.
---
exactly
---
Just looked and I’m not sure what happened. Doesn’t it affect total damage if you hit them in a limb vs the head or chest?
---
A lady friend of mine had someone kill her multiple times during a PvP event at Poseidon. She is LVL 60 and had claimed the workshop a while beforehand, this PvPer was level 180. After she died he buggered off with her loot. She chased him down and he killed her again. She then asked him was his deal was, said he wanted her loot but when he found out she was female I guess he felt bad or something and gave the stuff back to her. I felt bad for not being able to help but I was in the middle of battling a Scortchbeast
---
Thank you. Finally some sympathy. My gf was laughing her ass off and I feel so betrayed! 😭 Lol
---
Thank you. I'll happily take your one. 😁
---
My psn is pappododo 
---
What timezone?
---
Ayye I have a camp there too.
---
I dunno, I was on one yesterday, we had a bunch of people, everyone was getting pylons, but the impostor still didn't die.
---
They are when you're looking. Go on, give it a try from tonight and let me know when you find one!
---
Eastern Pacific, currently 1:16 PM

#scorchedlivesmatter. Even puppets deserve life.
---
Im from sweden 19.17
---
Wastelanders eill be on Q1 2020...cyberpunk and other AAA will crush Fo76
---
Now they cry about "no making moneyz" imagine the future when people play other AAA.  
---
Bad move delay Wastelanders and dont offer another "hook' for the months... the game will be dead before they get the bugfixes done...
---
And Vanguard isn’t great PvE gear, at that! Loses benefit quickly with damage.
---
Can add me. I might have my mic off quite often because my wife watches TV right next to me when she isn't playing. If I'm not busy with something else I'm more than happy to help, or at least craft you better armor or weapons appropriate to you lvl. Psn is imaloserbaby68. If you send me a friend request just post "reddit friend" in the comments so I know it's not spam. Same goes with anyone on here. My wife likes to help fellow wastelanders too when she does play.
---
In other words, 7:17 PM. 6 hour difference. Accounting for that won't be easy, considering I won't be on for another 3 hours at the least
---
Until food crafting has a point, it wouldn't matter.
---
Although my current camp has a dock on a river, so it would be pretty cool looking.
---
Spent around 3000* also. Only a couple keepers, and a few weapons I gave away because they were too good to recycle but too heavy to vend, the rest is mostly trash. I scrip the heaviest stuff first. Not for my build, but I did roll bloody explosive 10mm smg and bloody explosive double barrel. Was hoping for a mini gun or a good Fixer.
---
Yeah I know about them being Legendary, I've been trying to find them in people vending machines or trade with them. 
---
I've scrapped several pieces without learning the polished mod I didn't wanna lose the ones I have now.
---
I roll with a BE handmade, lever action, and railway rifle, and a bloodied swing speed deathclaw gauntlet. With 15STR, you can have iron fist, incisor, barbarian, and martial artist. 13PER for max rifleman perks plus concentrated fire.
---
I keep 6END for Radicool and ironclad, 4CHR for lone wanderer, 3INT for nerd rage, 8LCK for max starched genes, class freak, and serendipity, and the rest in AGI for max evasive plus level 1-2 action boy, adrenaline and gun fu.
---
I’m greedy with mutations, but for bloodied rifleman adrenal reaction and eagle eyes are pretty much mandatory. Grounded and scaly skin are pretty much mandatory for non-power armor builds since they’re just more free armor. I use talons, bird bones. chameleon, speed demon and marsupial as well for run-gun-swing style of adding the deathclaw gauntlet in the mix.
---
The handmade is for average enemies, concentrated fire for vats headshots should wreck most anything. Lever action for sneak sniping, railway for scorchbeasts/sheepsquatches/mirelurk queens. I like having the deathclaw gauntlet for when I’m being over run by mobs. I don’t use energy rifles because of the grounded mutation.
---
Moral?  100% yes.  Morals shouldn't even be questioned when it's a part of the game.  The game clearly informs both parties that if the workshop is contested, it initiates PVP.  People can not like it or think its mean all they want and they could be right about that, but the morality of it shouldn't even be a question.
---
I see entire camps that are glitched.
---
You have to clean the fish before you cook it, which gives you bone, but with a small chance you get some high-radiation fluid, too.
---
What platform? Im on PC
---
Got it. I'll add you when I'm able. Thanks ✌
---
Probibly ended at 10 then. I wish bethesda would be more specific on what times these events end.
---
I didn’t even realise Bethesda were delaying it, but I’m not surprised. I feel like they’re actually trying to be as pathetic as possible, and are taking bets on the number of players they can piss off.
---
I slightly disagree with some of that - sure, holiday sales are a bonus, there's no question.  But I think there's a bigger picture here.
---
If Wastelanders launches (whenever it launches), and it's a big of a clusterfuck as the initial launch was, I don't think there will be any saving it.  Delaying the game to prevent that is a bigger deal than any holiday sales they might miss out on.
---
There are plenty of things that can make or break the game, and no title is too big for that (though I can think of a few that are close).  76 is precarious, and any major blunder, or too many moderate ones, will spell the end.  Aside from a failed Wastelanders, they could eat it over P2W issues or nickle-and-diming players on too many convenience items (which they've done before).  They could overestimate their atom shop and price things beyond the point they can sustain the game.  And a number of other minor points that could add up to inevitable failure.
---
But most of those are longer term issues that could be corrected.  Failing on Wastelanders will be an immediate and, I believe, fatal blow to the game.  Anything they need to do to prevent that, including delays into or even past Q1, are better than the alternative.
---
 Dodgy(6): Avoid 30% damage for 30 AP a hit   
---
You did the damage he avoided 30% of it. It would show you your damage just like is does when you pvp in survival or adventure, serendipity works this way too you see the damage but it was reduced by X on their end.
---
Oh my god that's really bad and funny at the same time im sorry for that happening to you.
---
1. They are not trying to save face anymore. They are trying to keep the game going, for financial reasons. Yes your absolutely right on Beth's failure to adapt to new times, and its shows.
---
2. Cyberpunk vs Wastelanders isnt much of an issue. People who play Fallout, love Fallout above most things. The people who havent put up with Beths shit show since the start, were not gonna drop what they were doing to play Wastelanders regardless of its release date. This is why U see a bunch of post saying, should I buy this game?? People here will tell em yes, but the yong yeas and the laymen gaming, as well as Beths own mistakes say otherwise. So they never buy it.
---
3. The players that did join the game, joined because Wastelanders was comming in the following week, only to realize it dint. Most have already left, and wont be returning regardless of realese date.
---
4. The double down on P2W has driven off any potential customers, regardless if you compare to well... any game rlly. Not even the EA's have the aggresive P2W's as Beth had the balls to claim it would add.
---
5. I feel bad for the Devs of this game. It shows that they rlly care, but they dont have the manpower or budget to sustain this. This project is slowly, failing to desparity, and the way the game tracks items will eventually make this game unplayable in console. Most likely, the gods of Zenimax have told Beth to keep this game alive ATLEAST until Star Field releases, and Beth can sit in its high throne were it belongs (and trust me, if the game is actually good, comparable to skyrim, and freely modable, Beths reputation will sky rocket).
---
6. People in the gaming community like to forget. Yes they do. Maybe you dont. But most do. If this wasent case, we wouldbt get a yearly call of duty release, and fortnight wouldnt be the most grossing game of all time.
---
Unless you are running a vampire weapon. Then vanguard actually works haha.
---
I have school early tomorrow so i cant play
---
Thats funny.
---
I’m hoping we can control environmental things like daylight cycles (and a dark night), weather, and potentially making the whole server a high level spawn.
---
If we have to make new characters I’ve got no need for it.  I’d speculate there will be servers where you can keep your character/progress and those you can’t.
---
If this brings back PvP servers then OMG hold on there’s going to be some turbulence.
---
Head shots take more damage yes as melee weapons have a headshot modifier, but melee is tuned in Nuclear winter to be able to one shot on a grognak running attack anywhere on the body if you have all the melee perks, bloody mess, and some kind of damage boost. Baring of course they have blocker, or suppressor debuff on you. But again the number that shows is the damage number dealt to them after all calculations. Including DR, Perks, Debuffs, everything.   Meaning if if they had blocker, or i was suppressed, i would see that reflected in the damage number. The damage number that shows after a hit is true HP damage.  Meaning he 100% took 367 damage when the game modes cap is 355. Something only capable of reaching by stacking life giver, buffout, and a magazine that increases health by +10. 
---
  I had a 45% damage increase from melee bobble head and psycho, on top of all the melee perks and bloody mess.  So i was above the average one shot threshold. Apparently higher than the max health possible in the game mode,  if you know. The game actually worked properly.
---
Scopes continue to work fine despite chameleon effects.
---
The weekends would probably be best then. I'm able to be on much earlier on weekends
---
Go to the game's page on the Bethesda.net launcher and click on a drop-down menu at the top-right of the page, it should reveal an option to repair/fix game files.
---
I could give you a hand with it but won't be online for a couple more hours. My PSN is damian_13_666
---
Very true! But my Vampire’s Lever Action Rifle wasn’t as devastating with the Vanguard Armor as I had hoped. 
---
So, when Murghph (or whatever her name is) had the big sale this weekend, both got scripped!
---
It is certainly not bad.
---
Ok am still fetching the last codes
---
Ok can you add my psn when you come home and well talk more then
---
Most of us no matter the platform solo play. Atleast from what i heard or seen. The only times u really see groups is in raids and nuke runs.
---
I've been playing with two solid dudes for almost a year. 
---
74 year old Nam Vet. And a 54 year old Texan Desert Storm Vet. I'm somewhat younger, but damn we click as a team. 
---
Playing with others makes this game way better.
---
The question should be: CAN they add fishing to 76? And the answer is no. No they can't.
---
I get a lot of those underground ghouls in the front entrance. You know the ones who slither on the ground or fall just underneath it, then slide around doing damage (and you struggle to hit them back).
---
in my vendor if you're willing to spend some caporinos :-)
---
Ran into Grahm in Berkeley Springs this weekend. We cleared the town together. It was a great time. I know because he told me. 
---
Hiring a companion would be a fantastic addition to the game.
---
Well my best guess it was a game whoopsie over a hack or exploit. Apparently there hasn’t been any cheating on console but I’m not 100% sold on that.
---
They didn't add chat because most gamers use terrible, incomprehensible grammar.
---
Upvote from me. Too funny!!
---
cool I'l be home at like 4pm central time Ill hit you up
---
Believe you mean leather coat is rare from mire quests.  Traveling leather coat (the one with the backpack) comes from the roaming robot vendor.  Still very rare but not quite as rare as the leather coat and not as valuable now that backpacks are available.  Leather coat is more rare because the mire quests were bugged for so long.
---
That's based on my poll of more than 20 friends who all said they would not use private Servers if they had to start a new character, more so is the fact that if characters could not transition from one server to another, then it would not be viable for anyone except single players, and they already said you would be able to play with friends.
---
If I shoot them am I wanted?
---
What I believe is that the people of Appalachia did leave and some stayed but the scorched plague killed those who stayed. I mean if the Brotherhood didn't survive the plague then nobody else could. So yeah I think the plague killed everyone that stayed. But then we emerge from the vault kill the scorchbeast queen and end the plague. That's when the people return because it's safe in a weird way. I do believe some people survived but when we get to them it was to late. Like that park ranger lady it the cranberry bog her corpse is fresh. She was alive while we ran around but by the time we find her the wasteland got to her first.
---
Whoever wants this junkies explosive +50 damage resist while aiming submachine gun should buy it from me lol I have far to much shit in my stash. Yeah
---
I just spam the Grafton Monster and Protest events. Easy and quick.  Just show up to trigger them.
---
Oh that sounds like a bad nightmare haha. It's the radiation damage that hurts the most. But I just want my pink uniform, darn it! I'll kill as many sneaky, hidden ghouls it takes
---
Found a collectron, free to a good home.
---
You talk about bullet spounge hell alot of us useing 3* meelee see creatures not taking damage after hit.
---
Aside from 76 being a buggy mess at launch, this game served as a comeuppance for many to Bethesda for releasing buggy games.  Those people will never let the outrage train run out of steam, and Bethesda has been throwing them more coal than in the entire ash heap.
---
The real problem with Wastelanders is that pushing it back raises stability expectations as much as content expectations.  This is a FREE update from Bethesda for crying out loud.  It’ll disappoint most, be a decent enough update for some, and will likely be the last big thing we see.  Bethesda doesn’t have money to burn, and there’s no way this game isn’t burning money.
---
Nope. They're all still quite alive.  They're just now all mole miners, scorched, ghouls, and super mutants.  =)
---
Reward from the steamer trunk upstairs? Wheres this st?
---
I think the artillery grenades box is connected to the stash.
---
Subliminal left overs to make you think you need one 😉
---
You will probably only be able to send a copy of your live character one way into a private server, but not able to go back to the live server.
---
Either that or you'll have to specify character type and create a new one for private servers.
---
&gt;Bethesda is a different story, they didn't get bought out by an awful conglomerate
---
[Not sure how long that will be the case](https://youtu.be/qJt_i2_vsSw), and it explains the company's behavior and tactics lately.
---
Those ghouls have always disappeared after I’ve killed them. Very annoying. Especially in those rare instances when a 3* legendary shows up. And, yes, I’ve only been finding the weathered and dirty uniforms in the colored-uniform spawn spots.
---
B2525 Fixer
---
Bah that one is easy enough with green thumb and I think 7 pumpkin plants very close to quest giver/drop off point.
---
Edit for those who don't know there are a few to the right facing the house. A few behind. A couple near truck. And the playground has some as well.
---
Unfortunately you need a weapon with good fire rate. So the semi's are pretty much useless with vampire. You made the right call haha.
---
Thank you a lot for this. With this, I do not have to ask that stupid question.
---
I might get it, since it is not the most expensive game.
---
I have 2 PvP characters. Assassins/Sentinel Commando, and a Vanguard/Sentinel Junkies Heavy Gunner. I do well on both. I find I might do better on the heavy gunner simply because it's unexpected these days. The fire rate of the weapons really ends people quickly. He also has way more tanky perk cards. Basically I'd say it's more about your build than anything.
---
This bug drives me nuts, and has driven me nuts since I _think_ Morrowind. It definitely exists as a bug in FO3 and FO4 still, so I wouldn't hold out much hope of this being fixed.
---
Lol it's fine. I thought it was pretty damn funny myself. Nothing got harmed cuz I switched servers in time.
---
Be nice to have someone to talk to and go crazy with sometimes
---
Exactly. I find the colored hats just fine though. The 3rd floor of the bos side, right? Up the elevator?
---
The bug is actualy with every weapion its been tested already and if ur putting out too much dps. Any further hits will be seen as 0 dps. Had that bs happen to me out at a SBQ fight last week when i was useing my gattling gun.
---
In the exit tunnel. Looking at the launch prep terminal, it would be to your right. It opens after the launch prep is finished.
---
Like most people these days, I pay over $100/month for My Television Service, but I get much more entertainment out of this game.
---
Why carry a shovel when you could just eat them?
---
Preach
---
Tattered field jacket, green bandana, welder goggles, and a grey beanie. It says Raider, and so do my guns.
---
Something tells me they do this specifically to randomize vendor activity.  All the farmers would hit that shit right at reset and the server would respond slowly.  I personally had a heck of a time at the purveyor the moment the price dropped. I was getting Server is busy messages quite a bit trying to burn through my 1000 scrip.
---
To maintain scrip collection at zero thus avoiding frustration.
---
Harvest legendary sewerage during game play, at end of session before logging out, dump all junk, everything unwanted and legendaries into a bag in a bush Alt F4.
---
Fixed it for you.
---
Of course, your 20 or so friends who likely share the same playstyle as you represent the opinion of the entire playerbase.  
---
It's likely we may get an option to switch on/off player transfers, if not at release..further down the line.
---
i like that, i bought the trapper outfit a while back, i still wear it sometimes!
---
Great idea! I literally threw away about 10k steel this week farming legendaries for the sale. I usually dump it at train stations, so someone else might be able to use it.
---
I think they specifically won't do this to spread vendor access.  The current way is random vs every farmer hitting the vendor at reset time.
---
See! Now /that/ would make sense and when ppl back up I get nervous. lol
---
I have a pink uniform-are you interested?
---
That’s great, I wish all PvP enthusiasts are like you 👍🏻
---
clown outfit with fascnacht man head.
---
Alternate: 
---
straightjacket, prisoner collar, fascnacht man head.
---
I had no idea lol
---
Yes over deathclaw island
---
We got lucky. The Responders did most of the leg work, but failed to find the immunization in time. We found the last piece of the puzzle, and finished their work.
---
ha, one of my friends actually wears the clown outfit &amp; fasnacht man head!
---
Xbox here, I can craft you some metal armor with deep pockets mod. It will last you 10-20 lvls.
---
Poisonblood696. I will be on later tonight.
---
The fixer has two passive bonuses: a 20% boost to damage as compared to a combat rifle at the same level, and an effect that improves stealth and speed while sneaking. If you're crafting one it comes pre-modded for stealth, it makes .38 cal receivers viable options and gives you access to the cheaper rounds, and it looks kind of cool in green and blackened metal
---
I recently came back from a break and was surprised and very confused by these changes. There must be some way to get around the 110 pvp damage cap though. I expected to one hit a level 45 with a bounty and ended up being killed at level 260, embarrassing to say the least. I tried to exact revenge and get his bounty for the atom challenge but to my surprise he was able to kill me in on shot every single time using a railway rifle. I’m not sure how he was able to do this as I had more than 400 hp, tried using different railway rifles myself but found myself always hitting the 110 damage cap. Anyone care to explain this exploit?
---
You would be my hero. I'm on xbox
---
Ya well from what i seen most dont even bother useing mic. Personaly i wish they would of done mic server wide vs if a player is more then 15 feet away you cant hear anything they say.
---
Same. Do you have any cool outfits?
---
You don't really need the codes. [https://nukacrypt.com/](https://nukacrypt.com/) has the codes updated every week.
---
the skeleton mask usually spawns at fast freddys.
---
Saw a dead vampire once, months ago, but it was not lootable.
---
Yes. 3 spots there.
---
It's nothing special. Usually some ammo and maybe a weapon or two.
---
I think I may have found a plan or two before. Not sure.
---
But you need the card
---
There is so much toilet paper in the wasteland they should build in a pooping and ass wiping daily quest, if you don't do it you get constipation and lose agility :D
---
I lost a friend in a similar way. He was very skilled and friendly, but I got over encumbered and we started to follow our own paths because I couldn’t fast travel. Some time after he just stopped playing.
---
What’s’Vats criticals +50%’? I don’t use vats but i have a bunch of those from murmrgh, should i scrip them?
---
This worked so well ! Thanks!
---
How many caps, is the question tho?
---
Personally I ignore low levels in pvp unless they attack me.
---
But the reality is that the death penalties in this game are exceptionally mild, and it's really not a big deal.
---
So while I wouldn't go after a low level, I don't think any pvp in fo76 is ever a "dick move".  The game supports pvp, you control how much junk you are carrying and thus you control your death penalty.
---
People need to stop taking pvp so personally.  I'd understand if you dropped your entire inventory on death but you don't.
---
Plus I do not in any way understand why people hang out in workshops. protip: setup whatever resource extractors you want, then leave.  let the defend event fail while you do other shit, then come back for the "retake" event.  Kill the enemies, fix the extractors if they broke, get your junk and then leave again.
---
Hanging out in a workshop doesn't speed up the resource extractors.  Just pop back in to collect the stuff every now and then, you can fast travel there for free.
---
On PC too :D
---
200 scrip daily? Are you talking about the 150 from the machines plus the dailies? 
---
I drop cap-items regularly, but abandoning scrip-able items is hard to do, and I don't have room in my stash to sell much of it, even if I wanted to.
---
&gt;Most players will be logging in at roughly the same time each day
---
Are you sure? This game is played all over the world.
---
Meanwhile....
---
 The Outer Worlds release later this week (Which is made to smite Bethesda, the makers of Outer Worlds are the original makers of Fallout.)
---
And just to kick you while your down, Borderlands 3 just about to release FREE SEASONAL DLC.
---
I am Groot
---
I'm pretty sure most people afk for the combat armor reward. 
---
Ive only done it to hunt legendaries
---
The reason is how the world is built. [Precombines and Previs](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/86381/understanding-precombines-previs-and-why-mods-that-disable-them-can-cripple-game-performance?language%5B%5D=en) are optimization techniques that decrease CPU and GPU load. Camps do not benefit from these techniques.
---
A dead vampire, wait whaaa? I need to search around there more often! :')
---
I’ve been playing since beta solo cause my nat is nat3 and my operator can’t change my nat type to nat2 on my phone. So I can’t speak to any one but I can hear other people, lol. My operator said they can send me another sim card and a “mokkula” a mobile wifi box and change the ip to public... But now I’m moving to an apartment house with a router as apart of the technical improvements they just finished . F’n fiber optics straight to the servers man, lmao. And been waiting for the Wastelanders DLC to start my second charachter as a team medic. F’n factions man, lol.
---
It just works!
---
One of my favorites is in Charleston.  Go to the Fire Department and then head down the road to the dam for a little ways, you'll find an open house with 3 rooms and a semi-attic area.  This is probably one of the best places to camp that has a full building, the worst I've had show up there is a Scorchbeast that somebody lead over on accident, plus there's ferals/scorched/super mutants behind the house, but 1 or 2 turrets keeps them at bay easily.  Also, in one of the broken houses across the street, there's a cap stash on the top bunk-bed on the second floor.
---
Semi-related: I kind of wish that freely available random legendaries weren't a thing.  It's obviously way too late to change now, but it would have made for a better game IMO.  Seems like it would have been much more interesting to have the majority of the game involve handcrafted, standard weapons, tweaked to suit.    It would make the few named quest legendaries so much more appreciated, as well, as opposed to stash-fillers and cheap vendor items as they are now.  
---
On the other hand, grinding for legendaries is pretty much the majority of late-game content right now.   If you were able to craft your ideal load-out, save for one or two named items, I imagine people would lose interest fairly quickly.  Would require considerably more content- which costs more to make- to keep the same engagement hours.  Ah well.
---
I only start the event if I see 3 or more players over 150.  Sometimes it helps to ask others if they want in before you start.
---
I have a related complaint: when you buy a legendary from the vendor, can it be applicable to your level? Cause I keep getting lvl 35 stuff when I’m well over level 50
---
think its listed for 1179 caps
---
Ive seen the combo on a couple of players.
---
I really like it with the chainsaw. :)
---
Alas, the chainsaw is too underpowered for most of where I need to roam.
---
same, i just carry it around when i’m not doing much, then i’ll pull out my shotgun when needed
---
Also play with Noob alot. He's a good shot, and pays attention to his surroundings. Dictates enemy location well, but not to the point of knowing where everyone is. We honestly utilize the tools the game provides for us. Hacking to reveal enemy locations ... Etc. Good team Dynamics goes a long way when you find a good group to play with.
---
Or to give the Personal Terminal a real purpose.  All it's good for is letting you know when you can start those three quests.
---
I'll have to sell a bunch of junk for me to save that much, just bought a bunch of camp plans for my lil Halloween cabin. But definitely doable!
---
For a rifleman build, I recommend the lever action.  It hits harder than all other rifles save the gauss.
---
For single shot damage, you cant beat the lever, its got a great reload feature that sets it above the rest.
---
I have both a lever and a handmade, and the handmade is only a backup for the lever if it breaks in a fight.  The lever does a crapton more damage than the handmade per shot. 
---
The handmade fires a bit faster, but with a bloodied lever, and a bloodied build, there is not a thing in the game thats not a boss that  you cant oneshot.
---
Especially since you can get the armor that lets you breathe underwater
---
I have the Halloween costumes skeleton, witch and clown, with hats,   brown asylum uniform and hat, and in think the outfit from the space station. Nothing too impressive sadly. And a bit of caps
---
We are talking about the plan right? Also u/n?
---
Daily scrip should be at least 300 every 24 hours. Caps from Vendors should be a pool of 5000 caps for all Robot Vendors. We should be able to hold 50k caps and 3k Scrip per character.  Stash should be an even 1500, with certain tabs without weight. 
---
The stash boxes actually don't cause server stability issues, as seen with dupers and the vending machine exploit allowing you to sell over 100k items in one machine, essentially allowing infinite stash box. If one person can have 10 million items, I'm sure all the players on the server could have a combined of 1 million.
---
I don't buy camp items because I don't have any spare camp budget. 
---
Like you describe, I don't even consider most item skins because I'm not using that item. I only have a few skins for the items I use.
---
Yep. Lovely fun haha
---
Well I don't think it's entirely pessimistic, considering that they used the words 'raid' and 'dungeon' to describe content that is nowhere near what most people think those words mean. :P   I'm just trying to figure out what advantage they could get from releasing super remedial private servers. After pushing back Wastelanders for months, it feels like giving us a half-assed private server system with a price tag would go really, really bad for them.
---
I guess we'll see soon enough. TBH, if these servers don't have some useful advantage other than reducing the game's inherent lag, I will probably uninstall for good. One can only take so many disappointments haha.
---
Alright how many caps?
---
An Enclave option for the personal terminal in your CAMP or Pip boy would make sense
---
I would like to skins for weapons I actually use.
---
It was a couple months ago, never saw it again.
---
Looked kid size.  
---
Laid ouf flat on his back.  Slicked back hair, black cape, purple lining.
---
Make that a third from me
---
I don't have the plans, but I have the skull mask itself! 
---
StaceyBlep is the username :D
---
Agreed.
---
This right fucking here! I dont know how everyone cant see this.
---
That's not the last tape. The one after you launch a nuke is the most up to date IMO.
---
That is so creepy! I'm gonna have to keep a look out!
---
1.7k. I just bought a bunch of ammo lol
---
well, I could probably trim some caps of that price so you can fulfill your halloween dreams. How does a one time offer of 500 sound?
---
Whoops made a mistake on the number of scrip. I just corrected it.
---
I do the same with my legendary gear. I scrip the 1 stars and sell the 2 or 3 stars. Sometimes I try to craft them to be lighter so I can have more room.
---
In that case, using rifles, I'd look for one piece with a third-affix of "improved stealth", and try to get as many of the rest as "weapon weight reduction", rather than sentinel.
---
&gt;  utility items in the atom store
---
 ok, I take it. Then, maybe, it is a good opportunity for adding cosmetic items to the game, not to the shop.
---
It's  fine, I can keep hunting. I was just curious
---
“Is made to smite Bethesda” even though the creators said that is absolutely not the case and that both games can coexist lol.
---
Thank you for noticing this disturbing and largely ignored issue of systemic robot abandonment abuse. We at the Watoga Institute of Machine Priorities (W.I.M.P.) have been trying to rescue these poor abandoned robot babies who are frightened and lost without their home base which is often violently ripped out of their lives by unthinking server jumpers and just plain quitters. We hope you will join out cause and donate oil, screws and springs so we can keep them lubed and happy
---
This!! One of the main gameplay loops for veteran players is the vending and legendary loop. Such a low scrip daily rate is dumb. Maybe they should increase the scrip cap by 50 for every 50 levels. Basically a level 200 player could have 200 scrip.  A 350 would get 350 a day. This would at least give leveling up a little more purpose until the legendary perk system drops.
---
How the fuck would it be all that different if they made it static for everyone based on a server reset?
---
With the system now  if I play around 6pm every day and turn in all my scrip and redeem all my caps then by the time I log in the next evening everything will already be reset and ready for me hours before I log in.
---
If the system were based on a static server reset of lets say... noon pacific time... then when i turn in all my stuff in the evening then it resets during the day while I'm at work then it's back and ready for me when I get home.
---
There's practically zero difference.  Stop trying to make it look like everything Bethesda does is just to fuck over the players for no reason.
---
I also suggest 3rd person. Also, I turned off the FOV, or turned all the way down. I didn't like everything but what was in front of me being blurry. That helped some of the hitching in the camera movement, for me.
---
Logs in general would be great. For sales, getting ganked out of the blue etc.
---
500 caps sounds perfect! Could I bother you for your username so I can add you so you're easier to find? :D
---
I’m not so sure the game is running at a loss, with the price gouging on the atom store and the volume of activity that goes on there evidenced by their recent announcement, it sounds like they are raking it in with the atom store. Which I’m fine helping support further development on this game but not with $10 skins, I don’t want to be scammed, 1 skin is not 1/10 the content of the entire $60 game so how is that price acceptable? I want desirable cosmetics at a fair price, but SO many people do not agree with me on that surprisingly, and so they are only encouraged and it seems to be working.
---
Ah, until crossplay is active I will not be able to trade with a foreigner.
---
I personally would think it better that if u choose the private server option that what ever u have in that private server stays in that private server otherwise it will kill the market and values would drop to near nothing. I believe it to be an unfair advantage if u had a world all to yourself and able to collect all the resources u needed and wanted. I could afford a private serve but won't get one because i really enjoy meeting new players from all over the place to me that is very cool. I love to sell things and if the market tanks then to me its not worth it to continue selling. I see a lot of downsides to the transition between public and private and if allowed to happen with no penalties.
---
Fair point.
---
nuclear homie. Not being a dick, genuinely thought you may like to know
---
You can get them pretty easily by running the Forbidden Knowledge quests triggered by picking up Technical Data. WickadyChickady has a good youtube video on this.
---
I would honestly purchase $20 or so on atoms frequently if everything wasn't so ridiculously overpriced.  I'm not spending $10+ dollars on a skin or $5+ on a camp item.  I would spend $20 if it meant I could afford multiple things I want, but that is not the case.
---
The prices are ludicrous.
---
Hm sometimes I play with my numbers. Sometimes they'll sit for a week, and nothing. So il bring the caps down a few and then gone. But I also took a look into my vendors and noticed that they aren't as full as they once were a week or so ago, but probably because my stash is now full with legendaries that I'm scripting to get back to 1k
---
God, I hope not!
---
&gt; Right now most "raiders" are all about one shot ambush kills from the shadows in workshops. Most won't even fight fairly and travel away if their first ambush fails.
---
Even that behavior is lore friendly :p 
---
Raiders are opportunists that are going for the easiest way of getting something. A quick one-shot ambush perfectly fits the description, even though it's pretty unfair to the victim. Fleeing when it fails is also pretty self explainable when trying to ambush someone who's stronger/better equipped.
---
I already gave up on most of the typical raider behavior. I'm only a raider in the way that my character is dressed and the theme of my camp.
---
 I hope that Wastelanders while add some npc's that can be robbed and/of killed by people that want to play as a raider. I would like the addition of trading caravans that can be ambushed/ killed/stolen from.
---
Overall, I did well from Murmgh (or however you spell it) this weekend. Good rolls about 1-in-3 plays, but I tend to buy 2-stars in both armor and weapons. Kept 2 armor pieces and 1 weapon, sold some others that don’t fit my build for solid caps, and re-scripped the rest. 
---
Maybe Bethesda will figure out another challenge to trigger a 50% off sale in November to make up for the Wastelander delay (he said hopefully)!
---
Grab the gernade from ur stash box not the yellow box next to the artilery. Its screwy but i figured it out a week bk.
---
GRIEFER
---
Also not the original creators of fallout lol, unless old Interplay employees work for Obsidian??
---
I'll be on around 5pm if your interested. I think I have soldier and captain paints.
---
Source?!?
---
man.... now all i want is for Cyberpunk to come out quicker.  
---
looks SO good
---
It would be an even middle ground, and on par with most MMO style games. Some people including me think the cap increase will cause players to buy items from other players for huge amounts, especially using multiple characters. It will increase a bunch, but everyone will have better chances to get the gear they want, providing they save.
---
The best story I think I've read on this sub.  Absolutely hilarious.  What a little shit.
---
Have 1.25 mb up and half that in upload. Does pretty well. This can keep up with most any online game. 
---
The real issue comes from unreliable providers. If the lines are bad between you and a "node", then your gonna have a bad time.
---
If it's a satellite internet provider, your gonna have a bad time.  This type of connection is notoriously bad with latency. 
---
If it's a hotspot,  I hope you can afford it, I couldn't. It was costing me 20$ a week.
---
To date my favourite atom shop purchase is probably the vault tec generator.
---
 It's clean, quiet and stackable. More in that vein would be great. Eg. A remodel of the workbenches would be great. particularly the armor bench, fire and smoke indoors breaks my immersion but having it outside is inconvenient 😋
---
What time zone are you in in England it’s currently 7:01pm
---
Bethesda really needs to make more weapon and armor skins. Players waited 10 months for handmade skins for god sake. Same with power armor and regular armor.
---
I have a sweet robot armor set.....to my knowledge they have never released a skin for it.  Also faction related skins for camp and cosmetic would be great. They just need to mix it up a bit instead of the same old bundles weekly
---
nice guys really do finish last hey.     Just kidding OP , best of luck,  hope you find your mate again.
---
If you get more caps and can’t pick it up at the Asylum I’ll sell it to you for sure.
---
My apologies. 5pm est us. So around 10 for you guys across the pond.
---
hehe yes, same as on here, Banshinator.
---
are you on now?
---
I don't play unyielding builds, but I keep a set (5 pieces) that I wear for selling. My charisma goes from 4 to 20 and that makes a difference. 
---
You do what I used to do, but unyelding Is so broken, it Is worth the hassle when you carry 30 weapons after Line in the sand.
---
when i feel "serious", i wear the BoS elder's coat with a revolutionary general hat, cuz the only time i spent real money getting atoms, those were bonuses. i may as well wear em since i technically bought them. I like to imagine my character declared himself the new leader of the mostly-dead Brotherhood, but then got bored with that and just kept the coat. and he found the hat... somewhere lol.
---
when i feel "goofy", i rock a spacesuit with the Moonshine Mama Fasnacht mask. the blue face with a missle sticking out of it coupled with the astronaut getup fits the whole "space zombie" thing, what with my name and whatnot.
---
Both the Leather coat and the traveling leather coat are only available as drops from quests / events in the mire.  I believe the coat you are referring to may be the hunters long coat.

---
Lmao.
---
I would use the hotkeys but I get water from 3 Nuka Cola flavors, Inert Flux, canned coffee, boiled water; pretty much the same with food from a variety of sources; hot keys would be too impractical UNLESS they expand the hotkeys and default is what we have now, press F1 for example and get a 2nd set, F2 and so on....
---
Awesome! And yep! Just in the Whitesprings selling some old stuff :D I'll add you right now :D
---
So the PM states
---
"November 14th! Of this year! Draws closer. The one year anniversary of Fallout 76. On that day I will spread the holy final word of Todd Howard and his other lying bastard cronies, on how they have scammed so many into buying the horibble game that is Fallout 76. Stay tuned and remember my name, FredBearPizza.
---
These worked about originally because I used to use them above the small one that matches. Then one day it stopped snapping to the wall and going in the floor.
---
    In my opinion the weapon skins &amp; very few camp items are the only thing I  find worth while purchase in the shop. Maybe it's my CS;GO addiction but I gotta have those gold skins, and some of the weapon skins for unpopular items are so good (Wiffle Bat) I'd rather use those than more popular items. 
---
    I do wish EVERY item had love in the atomic shop, everything should have unique skins. Also completely agree with the camp budget; it needs to be completely revamped. A few plants should not take 30% of my budget.
---
Now that's great idea. I don't know why Bethesda doesn't increase things for players based off level and make it lower for lower level players. Especially the camps.
---
Same. I couldn’t even kill someone with a lever action. Granted, their whole team was with them and bearing down on me. But when I was alone with someone fully charging up a Gauss, couldn’t do it then either lol
---
Your luck must be better than mine.  I have not seen one other than the one I got from the player vendor.
---
Unless they come out with an announcement that it's equivalent to leasing a dedicated server, personal servers sound like a money making scam.  It looks like they terminated survival, sent all the PVPers back to normal mode where the only option for PVP is to mess with workshops, and then want people to pay to avoid workshop trolling.
---
I agree, i wont be usind private servers if i cant use current characters.
---
Fair enough dm me your gamer tag and let me know when you at ready
---
Uh, what the heck is with my comment. I guess this is the mobile thing people dislike? Sorry about that.
---
You are so negative and at least realistic, but chill out bro! I hope in wastelanders DLC, there will be a lot of new contents, and I hope that F76 will be a good game! then if you disagree with me ok, everyone have their own thoughts
---
ugh you’re so lucky!!! i’d give my life for the moonshine mama
---
I mean, he'd be a year late to the party after what YongYea and his cronies have done this past year, but sure, let him try something new.
---
I think the fundamental problem here isn't the timing of Wastelanders, but this idea that it's going to be like a soft relaunch. I don't understand where some people got this idea from or why it's being spread.
---
Wastelanders is adding a somewhat choice-driven dialogue system with a basic story that extends the main plot, and it's also adding a few factions with some small hub settlements for them. That's the extent of what we know. Now let's look at this in the big picture:
---
1. It won't change the performance or bug problems that are probably the biggest complaint against the game; in fact, it's likely to make both of those worse due to its scope
---
2. It won't change the Atom Shop's influence on the reward system or the existence of overpriced, shoddy MTX
---
3. It won't change the shallow endgame legendary grind
---
4. It won't change camp budgets or the many limitations on building
---
5. It won't change the game's baseline Easy-Medium difficulty
---
6. It won't add text chat to the game
---
These are basically the most common criticisms I've seen of 76, and none of them are the focus of Wastelanders. The only thing that the update focuses on is adding human NPCs back to the game with a bit more story immersion due to choice/stat checks, and while their absence has also been a big criticism of the game-- so it's great that these things are being added-- I can't see how adding them in is going to make the rest of the game's shortcomings any less impactful. Fallout 76 will play virtually the same with almost all the same functional and design problems that resulted in the many low critical scores and negative reviews.
---
So I would recommend that people really get a handle on their expectations for this update and stop spreading the perception that this is any kind of soft relaunch. That's likely going to result in little more than increased disappointment, IMO.
---
the vampire doesnt have an outfit/plan that can be looted unfortunately. there was a similar outfit in the atomic shop though. was.
---
Nope. We do need one. We have a personal terminal just for this sort of thing...
---
I think consoles do have some cheats or exploits in nuclear winter because I killed a dude doing the wall glitch near the college and he had a Automatic handmade with 90 shots in a single clip.  Never had to reload after 30 shots. It just kept going.
---
&gt; Usually people are friendly in this game and if a workshop is taken, they won't bother fight you to claim it.
---
I'm actually defending my workshops. I took it first and it's mine till I leave the server. Got to fight me if you want it.
---
Gilded minigun, leather coats, red asylum outfit, plasma grenade and mine plans, bos, white powder and whitesprings jumpsuits, responder fireman's outfit, western outfits and heavy raider armor plans, just to mention the most wanted ones
---
I entered Fort Defiance last week for the first time and got a Brown Asylum Uniform.
---
That could actually be it.  I'll ask him. I reached out to him and he doesn't know either.  Good thinking.
---
Edit:  I was really hoping this was the solution but he responded that he does not use dodgy.  This is either a genuine bug or maybe by some chance he had the unstoppable mag that has a chance to avoid damage from melee, and it functions like serendipity and shows false numbers.
---
when Fasnacht started, and i saw that in the shop, i needed to have it so i grinded atom challenges to afford it. i loved how it's a reference to the film "a trip to the moon" lol matching my "space zombie" theme was a bonus.
---
i'm sure if/when Fasnacht returns it'll come back to the shop, so. be patient. you don't need to trade your life, just a few hundred atoms.
---
I am saying obsidian said that is not what they are doing..
---
This is amazing!! More storeis like this please!
---
Bethesda needs to work on content that allows more endgame play for veterans along with the new quests in Wastelanders. 
---
-new nuke zones/bosses
---
-pvp battle arena 
---
-faction related content
---
-high level crafting recipes
---
-more ever upwards challenges
---
-better raids and rewards
---
-more NW maps and higher tier rewards.
---
-better worshop mechanics/materials.
---
-more cooking/farming content 
---
-more camp building items/bigger budget
---
-better trading and vending
---
Just my 2 caps.....
---
That's mega lame.  As a stealth sniper I neither camped nor griefed whatsoever.  There's no fun in being that kind of player.
---
The Inspector suit and bunny mask. 
---
Dont even have to fight super mutants anymore, just do a pose to assert dominance and they flee.
---
I just went to Vault 76 and killed a liberator. And found one. You're talking about the junk item Red Star Pin right? Unless I got lucky, I'd say they're pretty common
---
Fair enough - i wasn't making a particular suggestion - more clarifying where i did and didn't see the issue.
---
Unyielding armor set and drop your health below 20%. +3 Charisma for each piece at that health level so +15 for the whole set. 
---
Hard bargain at level 3 I believe counts 9 points in charisma. Grape mentats add 5 charisma and don't offer any other barter benefit beyond those added special points.
---
The prices for selling to vendors max out at 20 charisma and the buying from vendor prices reach their lowest point at 25 charisma. So it's pretty easy to overkill on it by overshooting. I have 5 base charisma and full unyielding set gets me to 20 so I don't need the perk or extra chems/food when I am only selling to vendors and only bother to equip the perk if making a very large purchase.
---
The price would be absurd if there was no in game mechanism for obtaining the items.  I think this is a fair trade off.  You save up and spend on something you really like and just miss stuff, or you thrown $$ at the shop.
---
In other words a $10 skin is high, Ive just earned ~$5 this week playing the game however.  Maybe I’ll buy that skin next week, maybe something better will come along.
---
You’re also assuming what Bethesda said was true.  There’s no reason to believe a multi billion $$ company wouldn’t just spew nonsense to the public.  It’s not like they have shareholders and said this at some corporate meeting where lying may get them in trouble.
---
i really hope, i’m excited for the halloween stuff this year
---
Right!! Incentivize being high level and putting time into the game for veteran players.
---
&gt; My normal rule is that if both are lvl 50+ anything goes in workshops.
---
My rule is almost the same with the exception of players that want to steal my workshop. A low level player (&lt;50) is still going to get killed if he/she tries to take my workshop.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Yeah, the default distance blur settings are really headache-inducing.
---
Hahaha. Sorry, its hard not to get triggered with things like this. Fallout is a game that I love, and Beth had never let me down before. Oh how the times change...
---
This gives me an idea. What if I shot my pet deathclaw with it? I wonder what she'd say.
---
really wish i would’ve gotten that too, sucks. i love it
---
Personally, I just want a sign on the Morgantown High School gymnasium door that says "Already Looted."
---
Vault tec universal baseball cap
---
Yellow,indigo and pink baseball bats
---
The suggestion really needs to be "Stop handcuffing your support staff and let them communicate with us."  
---
A lot of what you reference are old, known bugs. Bethesda knows they're there, but still forces their Support team to use canned responses with fix suggestions they know won't do jack and never accept responsibility. Give them canned responses that say the truth. "We know this is an issue and are working on a fix. Please bare with us". I'd respect that more than them trying to obfuscate the issue and blame it on our hardware or network connection. (Yes, I know that some things can be caused by both of the those categories, I'm referring to the issues that clearly are not).  
---
Thank you for raising this topic, OP.
---
Bethesda got shit for a helmet being recalled or something, when they probably have nothing to do with it. They probably outsourced it. So I totally agree they just have to save face at this point. Lots of people ready to crucify them.
---
I would also like a new premium currency take hold. Making gold and silver more rare makes sense. Having silver scrap worth 5 caps and gold scrap worth 10 caps would be a start. Wealth could be based on carry/stash weight with higher levels being awarded 50 extra stash weight every 50 levels. Good compromise in my opinion.
---
I wish something in game would indicate when things are rare. I’ve totally dumped some of these things after getting them (jumpsuits)
---
My favorite is that they somehow all flock to me and follow me up the elevator. Its quite funny thinking about ghouls using an elevator properly.
---
I would be playing right now but because I hit the script and cap limit today I'm not. Bethesda fix this.
---
Also all the fastnacht plans are real hard to come by right now, but will be available again sometime and won't be as rare after that.
---
Lmao. The real survivor mode.
---
Exactly - this!
---
Don’t forget forest camo jumpsuit, shielded raider plans, and really any asylum beyond brown/green seems to be of decent rarity (though I prefer the green).  
---
Also the urban and forest scout masks seem to be rare/desired now though I have characters with them and I don’t recall where they originated.
---
There’s also a VTU baseball cap from forest quests that I’ve only seen once.  Clean straight jack is uncommon though not sought after.
---
I’m one of those that play solely in 1st person so I don’t see what I’m wearing nor do I care what you’re wearing. I didn’t get this game to participate in a skin fashion show. Same goes for camps. Only reason I visit another’s camp is for bench use and/or vendor browsing.
---
What a douche
---
...I think I saw you both at some point.
---
We’re you playing on Xbox? I might have his gamer tag. Maybe.....
---
Hmm....
---
I'd pay Atoms for having a functioning slot machine in my camp (in various colors)
---
I'd pay Atoms for having a nice fireplace for christmas in my camp (and the ability to display stockings and nicknacks on it)
---
I'd pay Atoms for having functioning TVs that would play the Special videos along side Bottle and Cappy epsiodes
---
marine underarmor, Polymer combat armor, and spaceman helmet.  some weird skeleton type thing.
---
Very true
---
You could be right but it’s the same as the brotherhood knight who tells you thunder mountain is offline or the power plant announcer telling you monongah needs to be powered up, they could just be recorded messages on a loop set to play when the system detects something went wrong, it’s implied that 100% of the brotherhood was destroyed and the last 2 survivors were male so there’s no way a female is giving that information in real time, if melody somehow is alive then she’s no where near West Virginia as that’s the only way you could’ve survived
---
It seems like additional stealth is overkill with 40 AGI, but I guess I dont have other options anyways :)
---
That and the FF7 reboot. With both those, this game will be a distant memory. Plus the end of this week Outer Worlds will be on my list to be played.
---
I can help on basics like CAMP building, crafting/mods, events, speak to added content since beta... I don’t get into finding the perfect armor/ weapon specs or paying attention to enemy damage resist against certain weapons.
---
All the people still exist. We just kill them daily. As we all once learned about the people from huntersville being turned into super mutiants while others became scorch.
---
Everybody would benefit from somethin
---
My idea is a dedicated private server character. It can be a fully mature toon with a full stash that a player can bring over to the private side but once the line is crossed, that toon can only play on private servers. Either your own or a friend’s private server. That way players can have freedom without the danger of letting people bring things back into public servers.
---
Oh I've seen them get out of the elevator when I go to the 4th floor! Is creepy as shit but makes me giggle at the same time
---
I appreciate the thought and will keep trying! I'll let you know what I come up with!
---
I'm convinced that the troop of Pioneer Scouts are still alive somewhere
---
I agree - my Gauss rifle could do with some love
---
This is gold
---
Shh dont destroy my hope
---
None of those rpgs are online
---
Damn it Bright! Put down the Junkjet! You are not allowed to load cleavers into it!
---
LMAO ... rock on ... where was your camp?
---
Is it quiet? Damnit - i didn't realize that :(
---
No content in over 6 months. Nothing in the atomic shop for almost a month. Seems fine to me.
---
I think instigating is only good on some types of weapons. A hunting rifle instigating with my build I can go a max of 1.7k damage so I can kill any mobs in 1 shot but if there's a mire lurk queen, scorch beast, or fog crawler then it's best for my bloodied weapons instead.
---
Plans I would say T45 or T60 parts  
---
Weapons I would say the pink baseball bat, that is a guess but since I have found 6 yellows and 2 indigos and no pinks  kinda lines up. Also the Gilded Minigun is pretty rare never had one from a mob but have picked it up once from a lying around one.   
---
Clothing I would say any event only pieces, I have gotten two responder FD outfits (no helm yet) and that is over 200 dogwood die offs (got that shit down to 3.5 minutes with fast travel now)   
---
Junk, I have only seen 1 new souvenir toy car ever in my journeys.   
---
I can't think of any unique armor that is a possible spawn or drop that is any bit different than what is out there.
---
50 percent crit damage is very underrated esp for certain weapons. its way better than explosive for shotguns.
---
Good ol https://nukesdragons.com/ hadnt been back since finalizing my build so long ago but looks like they improved so much.
---
I hate fishing in games, so they should go full survival or don't do it all. Cast-line durability and finite amount, must be crafted with plastic. Rod durability. Sometimes your bait and hook can be detached and lost, sometimes you can lose your rod and you'll have to search for it in the water. Fishing in Games is so boring, but fortnite has the best fishing mechanics right now. Throw-Catch-Move On in 5 seconds.
---
So you’re friends are the majority? Gotcha.
---
i can tell you some that i remember. Both scout mask are a 0.1% chance of dropping from enclave events, plasma plans 0.05% of ash heap events, about 0.1% of leather coat reward chance from the mire events, 0.25% (dont remember that much) chance of heavy raider plans from rosie's quest only (so 1 chance per character and only if you are level 25 or higher) don't know about the rest, but minigun doesn't drop anymore or it's found as a rare drop like the lobber mod for the tesla rifle, but i think it was removed
---
You make a fair point, $1 to 1 Atom ratio isn’t totally fair, but I can only imagine their recent announcement means they’ll be reducing the amount of atoms you can earn in game, which will bring that ratio closer to reality, or god forbid they remove all ways to earn atoms in game.
---
do you have any double barrels with that i might buy it
---
yea any and all help would be wonderful lol, i havent played since release
---
A lot of the more recent bodies are responders and the like. I think the final scorched onslaught that killed most of the factions was mere months or even just a week or two before the vault opened. And there are almost definitely still pockets. I think at very least the free states have survivors. Potentially people who have become ghoulified and are hiding underground using radiation to survive.
---
Opinión = respected
---
I will never buy a skin or outfit since those things don't really interest me.
---
Camp stuff however I buy alot even though I never really have any Room for it with my camp budget.
---
When using a vender, there should be a timer that says how long till a cap reset.
---
Sent the FR, not too sure if it went through (I'm not used to adding people that aren't in the same world as me so I am CLUELESS! XD)
---
After Wastelanders I want them to make a giant DLC with new map space. I know it’s highly unlikely, but it’s what I want.
---
Next to the oil reserve just southeast of Site Alpha.
---
Haha that’s fair, not gonna lie I’m a big CAMP builder so I do actually like that I can get exclusive camp items, but usually tend to get them on sale as the base prices are insane to me. And it’ll be worse if they lower or remove the ability to earn atoms in game which sounds like what their announcement along with the delay was suggesting.
---
The treatment hadn't been finished before the Vault opened - the Dwellers were the first people to be immunized after completing the research
---
Yep. Technically, there’s no rule against taking a workshop from anyone - regardless of level. That’s what they’re for. My personal rule is I never go after workshops owned by someone under level 15 or 20. Above that, just depends on how easygoing I’m feeling.
---
If you’re on in half an hour, I’ll team with you.
---
This is hilarious, I would have returned the favor.
---
I said that because I was trying to not get comments like "tHeY nEed tO fIX thE gAmE fIRSt"
---
Lol I had to switch servers.
---
I dont see any requests yet, either way can you give me 20min? need to put the kids to bed
---
Hahaha priceles reply!😂
---
she sounds like a keeper ;-)
---
To those saying it was from the dev room, maybe, maybe not. Back during my time in the Beta I came across one of those in the shop and even saw players with it. They told me it didn't give them any extra protection so I never picked one up. Like the fast travel mat, it too disappeared after the Beta.
---
Here are some armor effects that are popular as well.  Sentinel, cavalier, ap refresh, unyielding, vanguard, chameleon.
---
You 100% right, I understand it’s their first attempt at an MMO type game but come on ESO and SO MANY games had the same issue of no end game content! (Now ESO does, but it didn’t at launch) Like how did they not make that a top priority? A live service game needs a reason for people to keep playing for years, not having 1 end game activity at all is just such a colossal fuck up I can’t imagine what the thought process was there.
---
Huh.  Could 100% swear I bought my traveling leather coat off that random traveling vendor.
---
Of course! I'm happy to wait :D
---
Send me a message and I'll come help you with ammo or modding a weapon when you need it. I would offer to group with you but I don't use a mic currently
---
Gt: CallMeCamer0n
---
This post pretty clearly captures every feeling I've ever had about fallout 76, good and bad.
---
If so, that would be a big slap in the face to you guys. Very”EA” of them.
---
I know! I was just adding on to your comment that dude was wrong on multiple levels, not sure where he getting his info
---
If they create a category to separate them, you'll start seeing lots of level 5 standard armor arms there.
---
You miss the point entirely. I'm pointing out a bug.
---
Majority no, but a good sample pool yes.
---
Graham has it. It's one of his cheaper plans. I realize this might not actually be helpful.
---
Were you in Alpha? Did he nuke the alpha site and catch you accidentally? Or centered on your ass?
---
I norm just go to the WSR and go up stairs use the hand print scanner to use the enclave enterance.
---
Guess the main story has been out long enough spoiler tags aren’t needed. 
---
Everyone is dead or mutated this early on.. The nuclear winter (actual one, not the mode), Scorched plague, FEV, it all messed Appalachia up. When the Vault opens and we start looking for the Overseer (one of few people we know who are maybe alive and out there somewhere) we find out what happened.
---
Adding human NPCs (which I honestly couldn’t care if they’re there or not, I love the game) was probably always the plan.
---
add supercooldude if you wanna hang with a cool guy
---
You sound you just want to be over powered right off the bat and complaining about something before you’re even level 50 is a huge sign of that cuz it doesn’t take long to get there anyway, yeah you start off with power armor and a mini gun in fallout 4 but that’s just to kick off an epic start no so you can be overpowered, it was T-45 power armor missing 2 pieces while being halfway broken and all you had was one fusion core and enough 5mm to fight the deathclaw so it wasn’t like most of it was usable anyway
---
That level requirement is there so people don’t skip grind and so that they can enjoy the game at a slow pace and actually appreciate things like the story, the struggle and the environment rather than immediately start one shotting everything, so your new weapon is 5 levels above you, so what? It’s not 100 levels and impossible to get or ever equip, I’ve never seen anyone on here sound so impatient over something like level requirement and if you think that’s a huge problem then this isn’t the game for you
---
Could have, Maybe someone sold it to the vendor bot.  My first one came from the Charleston train station.  My buddy said he paid less than 50 caps for it.  He also recently bought a leather coat from another train station.  Some people do not realize the rarity of items and sell them for caps.
---
Centered directly up my ass. Lmao
---
It doesn't appear on my stash.
---
Never seen it end in the middle of the lake. That's an intersting way to finish.
---
My personal favorite was in the Flatwoods map, I was 1v4 in the final circle and still trying to get the "naked wins" achievement. The scorchbeast literally spawned right at my feet, so I immediately took off, and ran through the fields by the lumbermill, and dragged the SB right through the middle of their team, who also happened to all be naked. The SB killed all 4 while they were chasing me, giving me the win.
---
Already got stuck in a battle between a SB, a 85 Sheepsquash and a Mirlurk Queen, all 3 legendary...
---
For 10 minutes a was witnessing a kaiju battle D: then I finished the 3 of them and loot like a coward... That happened at quarry x3 if I remember correctly.
---
Oh yeah, I've been hunting him solely for the past  35+ hours or so LOL.  Saw him twice since last Thursday but no plan either time.  Hoping to discover some consistency to his path.
---
Sounds good, psn is Coogr77, I’ll be on around 5pm central
---
Unless you don't carry your good junk, as you kinda shouldn't carry.
---
I’m down now message me your GT
---
I can’t argue with you, you’re right. I guess I was using that phrase to indicate how it’s an opportunity to bring in a massive new wave of players as well as bringing back disillusioned Day one players, more so than addressing all the specifics you mentioned. Although to be fair, A LOT of the launch issues have been addressed or lessened. It’s not perfectly stable, i still get sliding, laying down ghouls, but I don’t crash NEARLY as much anymore, and the sliding enemies is way less often as well. So I figure between the progress that’s been made on technical issues and the overhaul as whole, it qualifies as a re-launch of sorts, but keeping in mind what you mentioned is very important if one hopes to maintain realistic expectations!
---
Dollars to donuts they didn't mean to sell it just going too fast selling to the vendor or it got stuck in between some junk leather items.  I sold my leather coat twice so far, thank the gods I caught myself doing it and bought it back.
---
I completely agree!
---
Right.  The new quests are fun and everything but you can only do those so many times before people get burned out.  The player vending loop is what most of the high level players are doing right now.  They just need to add more mechanics that allow players to create their own "fun".  The player vending was one of these things.  
---
I think adding community events like cleaning up appalachia could work as well.  If they made this faction based it would be really fun indirect competition.  For example:
---
\-Allow players to join a faction in the game, BOS, Enclave, Raiders, Responders, Mistress of Mystery, Free States.  
---
\-Have a weekly challenge that awards 500 scrip/150 atoms/legendary item/etc.  to the faction that kills the most super mutants that week.
---
Things like this could be a fun side game for people to engage in.
---
I got the game a month ago, I really didn't know.
---
Idk why then because i see them in my regular stash box and every stash box i hop to.
---
Not at all, but I think it's indicative of the general consensus, if a character was locked to a Private server, then you would lose it as soon as the host got tired of paying his server rent, or got tired of you, so they must be transferrable to be viable for anything other than single player mode.

Drinking with the party boy maxed is +3 charisma.

---
Damn, the salt in this post is enough for an eighth ocean. Grow up, you don't work for Bethesda. 
---
It's dumb for an MMO to make players juggle multiple cooldowns. The Division 2 launched with a bunch of things on different timers and they ended up switching back just because it was a pain for people to manage.  There is no real justification for it, and the argument against it is obvious. There's also no way to track the actual cooldown, which is a mess because it doesn't all reset at once (or does it? Nothing in the game tells you either way). Linking it to the daily refresh is obvious and makes everybody happy.
---
This happened to me once with one of those 'under-the-map' CAMPs. Luckily, I'm fairly quick and was able to open my map and fast travel to a nearby location as I started falling into nothingness.  If people make CAMPs like these, then they should definitely check before logging off.
---
It’ll be nice to experience some innovation, originality and creativity in a modern game, feels like these concepts are in very short supply these days. I find myself going back to old 360 games a lot because today’s games are just so “meh” in a lot of ways.
---
I run a bloodied build if I can get one shot by a rad roach my own explosive damage can get me as well
---
Coolio! I’ll be sure to drop an Add, we’re on usually every night :-)
---
Yes delaying it is so bad. I’m very upset Bethesda is taking their time to ensure Wastelanders isn’t a buggy mess at launch. Oh the horror!
---
Thank you for the response beth:)
---
Lol yeah. But that was your mistake.(made the same)
---
If you already have the camera, don't check the terminal entry for the suspicious person/body whatever it is.
---
They look great, but there is a bug with the marine and recently the trapper armor that allow them to clip through.  [https://imgur.com/a/acnhVk9](https://imgur.com/a/acnhVk9)

Hrrbble?

Whhhrgggrrrbbbl!!!!
---
Sounds interdasting, you should merk your colander.
---
That TLDR was masterfully crafted. It created expectations that went entirely unfulfilled while also being completely truthful.
---
I been playing mmo's since kabam first came out with edgeworld. Then 12 yrs later i moved onto WoW then ESO. Then after alot of bad reviews i moved onto anthem &lt;&lt; witch ill never play again.. then bought 76.
---
Oh god. If only he knew...
---
I suppose if he has never seen it before, I can understand wanting to read the whole terminal (although I stopped wanting to actually read them after about level 30, myself). But centering his nuke on the camp of the only person who helped? My dude, indeed.
---
Glad to see you swapped servers in time to save your camp. Hope you got his name. You can use one of your 14 keycards to return the favour!
---
To each their own. I’ve used/rented private servers so I know the workings of them. My friends are all for getting a private server, modding it till our pc towers fall over and running a strictly role playing system. We could care less about creating a new toon. Hell, the only replay value this game has in its current state is to run new toons and experiment with different builds.
---
I'd take the 25% if it weren't so darn inaccurate. At it's current accuracy, I just avoid TS altogether for anything I plan to use outside very-short ranges.
---
Absolutely on the pricing and applicability of cosmetics - totally agree.  
---
To add to that I think *anything* in the store would be more appealing if it was displayed in a way you could see it as it actually is, almost 'in game' as it were. Whether its and interactive item or a gif/vid of it in action, spin around with a clothing item on a character or show an item functioning in a camp with audio etc.
---
A mini demo reel for each thing if you will.
---
So for example the Free States revolutionaries uniform that had the big white star in on the chest, that *wasn't* in the store image, or the snipers outfit that didn't come with the gloves that *was* in the image. All issues for not   
---
Then for camp items if you could actually see what it did - i'm sure they would have a larger uptake:  
---
\- if the scrap bot's dialogue was obvious at the start?  
---
\- the statue effects for marine, mothman or there was just a thread on the rocket last week where a guy didn't realize it took off
---
\- or me with the vault tec generator being silent! I remember that going on sale and i didn't bother getting it as i figured it would be like the other small generators.
---
They leave too much to the average player going out on a limb to try it or people coming across it in the world. That's great for the story - not good for promoting content
---
God, your older than my grandmother. I only have flap limb because I'm a mother effin' scorchbeast, yo! lol
---
Mine is a Mutant's Swing Speed Reduced weight, with my WWR Armor, it like .08 lbs.
---
That doesn't solve the price problem per say. The prices remain insane; the only difference is now you get double the digital bucks.
---
It's a digital item; there is no true value to it save pixels on servers with a shelf-life that we the playerbase have no clue about. If they were wise they'd reduce the price; though I fear instead they'll double down and add a system similar to Crown Crates on ESO. 
---
After all that was their business decision when they saw that costumes on ESO weren't selling as well as they hoped at crazy prices, they threw costumes into gamble crates and called it a day.
---
That's a fair statement. I just think it was a bit absurd to assume your groups opinion was representing the playerbase. The community I admin is split 50/50 on the topic, as half want to get away from the broken economy, while some don't want to lose progress.
---
End of the day I think we can all agree that having the option to switch it on or off would be best to ensure everyone can experience the game the way they want. By no means did I mean to shit on your post.
---
I  came across a blue, green, and brown last night
---
Yeah, this is a thing.  I've seen Rad-Rats and Stingwings with Sentry Bot properties.
---
In fact, I just got killed by a Legendary Scorched that blew up like a Sentry Bot.
---
As much as FF has a place in my heart for the memories I have from my younger days, the censorship in both FF7 remake and FF8 remaster piss me off. Fuck SE and their bullshit “ethics department.” Was Rinoa’s outfit REALLY offensive? Sure Tifa had some proportion issues, but it’s not like that was her defining characteristic, she’s the type of female character you would think the PC crowd would embrace bc she kicks ass. And while these may seem like minor things, the concept is just infuriating and it’s so unnecessary, and they aren’t even consistent bc they don’t censor Shiva. I just don’t want to support pointless censorship and pandering to the fun police. And don’t get me wrong I don’t think everyone should have free license to be assholes or to perpetuate stereotypes, I’m not that extreme, but this is definitely the pinnacle of unnecessary censorship.
---
Like I said, my hero. Wish I could upvote you more than once. And that shower idea? You sold me so hard. I want this. Why is this not a thing??
---
In the whitesprings, upstairs there is a nuka cola store
---
I wish Bethesda would have dropped the damage on explosive and two shot down to 65 pct apiece and made explosive into at tier 1 drop instead of tier 2.   That would have made it so two shot and explosive would never drop together on the same gun and still retain much of their power.  Problem solved in my opinion.  Instead they do a heavy handed nerf and angered everyone.  When they did this it dropped explosive damage on launchers, fat man's, grenade launchers, etc effectively making them terribly under powered for the weight and repair costs.
---
There is a vendor upstairs in the whitespring resort that sells them.
---
At the risk of ruining some CAMP locations, there's actually a whole lot of space in the existing map that isn't used for much of anything.  Massive swaths of the Savage Divide are just repetitive emptiness.
---
[Sure, come in my arms big boy.](https://i.imgur.com/bDBjzGV.png)
---
Not saying it's bad, just that FFR and E are more sought after than V33
---
You guys (gals?) just made me so happy! I MIGHT just try this. So many cool things to unlock...!
---
I saw the 'nades once on my stash and that was the only time I see the artillery grenades spawning on the stash.
---
the in-game notice has been removed, but I can't confirm if the sale is actually over.
---
Yeah. That is true. I want to explore again, though. I want to see mountains again, MOUNTAINS GANDALF!
---
Like in Fallout 3 and New Vegas, with the stat requirements to deal full damage and keep on target.
---
It’s actually a smart move by Bethesda, not only can they actually take their time with this and fix a lot of bugs that would’ve  beeen struggling with and complaining about in several weeks, it also lets them make more money instead of missing out on it, in the eyes of the public 76 is still an irredeemable shit show other than it’s dedicated players, who’s gonna look at all these games that releasing this season like borderlands 3, modern warfare, Star Wars fallen order, monster hunter world iceborne, destiny 2 shadowkeep, fortnite 2, plants vs zombies and alot more then look at 76 and it’s supposed big dlc and be like “yeah I think I’ll  go for this instead”.
---
Now that it’s delayed the only competition has to worry about is cyberpunk and while that is still a huge problem it’s still only one game and it won’t be drowned out by a shit ton of other games, I doubt anyone but us would’ve even noticed this game during the holiday rush, this is better for them
---
E shotguns cripple more, but yeah V50 is underrated, I was just listing the popular effects
---
cant see any friend req, whats your ign and Ill try instead?
---
You can make Dark with the recipe, also
---
You say this with sarcasm, but I don't think you're wrong.  They actually don't want you to binge on it.  The entire reason they have these constraints is because they want you to come back everyday.
---
I sure hope it isn’t
---
I have a lot of daily chores so to say.. one being; when i see the wolf quest, i always do it.
---
you get 3 legendary level 5 or 10. then when i get em i always look on the map to find someone thats around that level to surprise them with it. :D
---
Exactly that, allows for more specialised builds, increases build variety and adds more weight to you special allocations.
---
And it can effect gameplay in a way that isn't just looking at damage numbers.
---
thanks man   mines johnny2-step   ill be on as soon as i sort through all the gifts from my fiances baby shower yesterday lol
---
At least someone with a bit of knowledge :o I don't get why some people think it's normal a laser just become transparent because everything is transparent &lt;_&gt; between first person view and third person view, you can have different display. If they tweak first person transparency, the 3rd person will not be affected. Used to do that for some animations on falloutNV with some mods.
---
Did you say 500 stimpacks...
---
Then shut up and go back to BL3? Both games are bad, who cares.
---
Witnessed a mirelurk Queen do the same movements, noises, and explosion after dying
---
Wow. Gonna try snipe long distance with the back powder I got from purveyor. Sound like fun.
---
Ah I get you now!
---
The raids are why I can't get any of my friends to play anymore ☹
---
The raid rewards are fine. You end up with more ammo scrap than you can bulk and sell and the standard and expert raids reward you with the ability to craft 3* legendary armor from your armor bench. That seems like enough to me, not to mention all the icons and challenges associated with it. People don’t run them for exactly the reason you mentioned, they’re casual players and the raids are not casual content.
---
Lol I do it daily just to grind for scrip. It fills in the gaps that 3*s leave.
---
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
I started playing in June and got it then. Did they bring it back? I’ve got everyone since then. And freakin love them
---
PvP only exists in Workshops now that we don't have the survival servers.
---
Meanwhile all weapons are balanced in a flat algorithm for Nuclear Winter and I'd say that the overall gunplay balance in Nuclear Winter is light years ahead of both base Adventure and Survival ever reached. Although a major portion of that balance is the fact there aren't legendary weapons, so take that how you will.
---
Staceyblep :)
---
that's a somewhat neat-o shovel. dang lol

I bet there are people that are going to be revealed in Wastelanders that were hiding in bunkers/caves/etc.  There are a few people from the Responders that were not verified as having died.  I imagine the rest are people that are returning to Appalachia or migrating from other dangerous areas.
---
I'm lvl 150 and saw only my second Flatwood's Monster yesterday. I need to kill it for the challenges (kill cryptids and kill an alien). He didn't see me yet and I was lining up my shot. I pulled the trigger... and nothing. Tried to uncrouch, and nothing. Server disconnect.   
---
I feel you my friend.
---
Ive never seen a legendary SB unless it’s the queen.
---
How long ago were you having trouble with furious? They patched furious a few patches ago, and I haven't had trouble with it since.
---
Interesting, so as long as you use vats, the damage is increased by 50%?
---
you are right, doesnt look like it sends the FR at all, usually you see it being sent. gonna restart my game, hold on
---
Wait till you witness the magesty of 5 scorch beasts at once and their entourage, the crap ton of scorch.
---
Not only is it a fight of your life and your squads, the fps lag almost breaks the server
---
I have to check, way too much stuff on several mules lol
---
I'll do the same just to be safe :o
---
This whole debacle started with Bethesda launching an undercooked product, so they wouldn't miss holiday sales.  Overall, seems like it was a failed strategy at maximizing profits.
---
I'm setup in the center cabin. You get a good bit of plastic that spawns there. Plus, when it respawns you can generally run to the cat lady house for more. I was able to build a nuclear generator in the center of the top rafters. The super mutants spawn in the North cabin anytime someone fast travels there. Great for materials or items to sell. So far, about 1 in 10 has spawned a legendary.
---
Don’t know what system you are on, but I just got the key last week on Xbox. It did take me a few tries.
---
It was over as of when I checked about 90 minutes ago. So probably ended around 9am PST. (I was hoping to sneak in one last 150 scrip purchase, myself.)
---
I play NW almost exclusively now, too. I'd like to see some new modes, some new maps, or at least a rotation of the two we have. New weapons that don't suck, would be nice, too. The gauss and assaultron head aren't as useful as they should have been.
---
I really don't expect for NW to get any attention until after Wastelanders, so sometime next year.
---
I’m a higher level, but still like to rehash missions and help out, add me Coogr77 😊
---
Tbh, I would have laughed my ass off too. But, to you, my sympathies
---
Atom-Shop-CAMP-Items BFFs ❤
---
&gt; Being realistic, a Q1 release date all but certainly means the very last day of Q1, which will be right around April (when Cyberpunk comes out).
---
This is pure, 100% conjecture. I would easily take the field instead of 3/31/20.
---
Obviously same time relative to the player :P
---
I think a stock Fixer also has a higher base damage then a combat rifle with all the same mods.  I could be wrong.  
---
I built a fully auto fixer for my buddy who runs a stealth commando build.  He had a really nice handmade with all the great effects but he was tired of the 556 grind.  The combat rifle I made him was a .38 fully auto which did  a lot less damage but ammo was plentiful and even free from player vendors sometimes.  This was a few months before the Fixer was added to the legendary pool.
---
The raids have difficulty selection for a reason though, standard should be able to be completed by at least 50% of the players at level 80+ but I feel the number is a lot lower than that. Mostly due to the stability issues though. 
---
As for the "ammo scrap" you can get way more ammo building mats from doing other things in game currently. Plus the rewards are only once a day so the ammo gained (if you even complete it) is tiny on the larger scale of things. 
---
As it stands high end players have no reason to do raids and mid level players either can't or just like the high end players have no reason to do the raids. The rewards aren't unique or grindable so there is no point.
---
With my current perk build (maxed out commando, bloody mess, demo expert, tank killer, and ground pounder) my two shot auto combat rifle does 169 dmg per shot.   My primed auto BE handmade does 126 dmg per shit and my auto AAE handmade does 121 dmg per shot.  The main difference is my handmades run a 30 shot clip (drum) and the combat rifle is 20 shot clip. 
---
I have Adrenaline perk of 2 and if I do chems those numbers will increase.  I’m pushing 230 on the rifle and close to 200 on the handmades once those other features kick in.
---
But if you "sounded salty" that would mean 'down-to-earth', are we just only using it to mean 'resentful' these days?
---
Agree with you on all fronts. It is getting ridiculous.
---
It's a discussion post, that helps us all learn a bit hopefully, I never expected everyone to fully agree, and the differing opinions is what make the discussion interesting.
---
I'm always amazed at the speculation that comes with the little hints of info Bethesda gives us, some of it defies all common sense, I think it's important to remember that Bethesda's actions are a business decision based on improving revenue, so they have to do things that will appeal to the masses, and be sustainable.
---
Placing bets it's less atoms but more to do to achieve them
---
love these bugs... I think we managed to add eachother now at least
---
Xbox. I'll give it a try again today, I've been following the support page for the issue and no updates. 
---
They may have fixed it and not said anything, but Val seek is one of the Bethesda folks and didn't say anything about it.
---
Thats a pretty good gun you have.  I run a hybrid build with stealth rifleman and points in 1H gladiator.  I like melee when I'm doing nuke runs (power armor) and for fighting the queen or other beefy bad guys.  I'm sure there are way more optimized builds but I enjoy the stealth play and switching to melee if I get swarmed.
---
Edit: I'm a level 200 btw
---
I'd like to think I sounded down-to-earth, but most people are using it to mean resentful/upset lately.
---
It's $16 on amazon for a digital download code you redeem in the bethesda launcher.
---
Unless there's some sort of digital download other than buying a code that gets emailed to you?
---
&gt; That is a potentially huge amount of new sales that will be missed.
---
&gt;So that’s the bad, why this delay is not good at all for Bethesda, but as I mentioned I support it, and it may be a good sign for us as the consumers. 
---
Im sure Bethesdas accountants are crying about it. But even them, can't just make it appear. Wastelanders were supposed to come out in fall. In late fall, they annouced it's got pushed at least 3 months forward. And we have good reason to think it's 4-5 months in actuality. 
---
They are not going to spend 3 months polishing it up. They don't have it. Im sure they have started the work. I don't think it's going to be as huge as many want or believe it to be. But to push it so far ahead, means they have really a lot of work still to do.
---
I'm with you on NV armor. Also, I'd love to see the Scaffolding Building Set return.
---
I'm going to start with what I agree with: Wastelanders will bring/would have brought a lot of new players to the game. But so did Nuclear Winter. It's not really a re-launch (as others have said before me), but it IS a big change. I wish we could be confident that it will not cause new/bring back old bugs, but at this point, I think many of us are just looking for some new way to enjoy the wasteland. I also agree that the timing of this update being pushed back might not have been a great decision as far as RPGs go. CD Projekt Red is possibly the only developer who says "no micro transactions" and stands a chance of pulling it off. I think most of us are hoping on a rock solid game, just like The Witcher 3 was.
---
What I cannot agree with is your statement that looking after their customers is "reminiscent of the Bethesda \[you\] remember from the old days." What old days? Skyrim's release on consoles was AWFUL. I had it on PS3 and had to wait a YEAR after the first release of Dawnguard for it to make it to my console. And you can bet your ass it was still buggy as hell. Fallout 4 bugs still persist, and were left to modders to fix. And some of those bugs are in THIS game. Then of course, there's the canvass bag fiasco... Please don't misunderstand: I still play and adore every one of these games. But they're modded to get rid of a LOT of problems that I don't see Bethesda fixing. I don't want to argue. I just seem to have a VERY different memory about how Bethesda handles their customers.
---
Having skins that swap geometry are really nice like the high-end power armor skins, etc. This works well because you can apply them to whatever power armor you want, even a hodgepodge and they look consistent. The weapons are trickier because they are so different, but even so, it can be done. Look at the pint-sized slasher skin which is for a machete. There's no reason that couldn't also work with a combat knife or other knife, even a sword. This gives flexibilty for applying it to various weapons that you may have and makes it worth more. Skins that are just retextures need to be much cheaper since they only work for one item type.
---
Exactly, if we can't discuss things without hearing both sides then may as well be on the regular Fallout reddit.   
---
Sometimes I feel they leave things purposefully vague to test the water for upcoming changes and additions.
---
Halloween spirit if I ever heard it 🧿
---
How high? I don’t mind high levels helping out its just some just kill everything and we dont want that, we still want a challenge yanno!  ill drop an add!!
---
Do you mean the kill the wolf pack leader quest in the forest? If so i've done that half a dozen times recently and never got a legendary out of it, the alpha is always just a regular wolf. I figured it was different from the other Hoard quests because you can sometimes farm them for a few legendaries, but never the wolves.
---
What he says is that every completed run gives you more resources than those used. I'm a high level player and i much prefer to raid with friends and get ammo scrap,instead of wasting 1 hour gathering ores and acid.
---
The reward ARE unique and grindable what are you talking about. You only get them here and they are the best in game.
---
the most scortch beasts i had to fight in a row was 6 but 3 of them were at the same time. was doing that brotherhood quest which takes you to the glassed caverns, by the end of it, out of the 6 guns and 1 melee i had on me, 1 gun was left unbroken but the experience i got from it was unreal.
---
as for the lag, LMAO, ive had that many times during SBQ events, i honestly thought it was gonna crash so many times
---
Well that just burns my keister lol. It's all good. I just have bad luck
---
I can only carry a J/SS/RW shovel...the finest, uhh, corpse burying implements for this buckaroo  or nothing at all 🤣😂🧟‍♂️
---
success :-)
---
Ahh so we have a similar build. What perks do you recommend and what does your special look like? I would like to run two handed melee, I think lol
---
I use it in Low level areas sometimes, the sound it makes when you hit something is hilarious, Bonk!
---
I find myseld getting  easly caught in this. I run out of vendor money and the  script then  spend the  rest of my day trying to get things to sell out of personal vender. Which blows dick cause i cant dp anything i cant stockpile more shit and i have to stay online to sell shit so i just do a lot of afk sitting  around after the cycle is done. Its lame and i expected better from the fallout series.
---
Thank you so much! My emote wheel was bugging out when I was trying to wave which is why I ended up looking down! and jittering about. Be happy to trade with you again some time! :D
---
OH, if they reskin the Super Sledge PLEASE BETHESDA I BEG OF YOU RESKIN THE DEATHCLAW GAUNTLET
---
It looks BAD. ASS. in 3 and NV and now it just looks alright I guess.
---
Anyway, I would love to be able to buy ghoul skins. Always wanted to play as a ghoul without having to mod. And again, there'd be no advantages or requirements, it'd just be a skin.
---
Can only agree. Bet half of them never even completed a standard run.
---
People seem to be forgetting that fo3, 4, and new vegas didn't have level requirements for weapons and armor, but instead you had to pick up perks and skill points over time and levels to specialize in those weapons and deal more damage or fire more accurately. Bethesda should have found a middle ground between the standard level locking system of MMORPGs, and the leveling system that they have used in every other game that they have made. In short, stick with what you know, or at least in the same ballpark.
---
Alright
---
I really dont get why people have such an aversion to playing with others and speaking on the mic. When Im bored in the game I'll just go to random players camps and start talking to them and trying to joke with em but most people just seem to be so anti-social. Literally nothing bad is gonna come from a 5 minute conversation in-game so theres no reason to be so afraid.
---
Were you in power armor when you were doing this? I was not in power armor, maybe that has something to do with it.
---
I feel like I have been using a shotgun since the dawn of time, and I am still waiting. To be fair, after six months of diligent checking, I stoppedcaring. So maybe they exist now. But somehow I doubt it...
---
I got a spare nuclear keycode if you need
---
that i did.... never worry about low health or caps (stims are a gold mine at the vending machine)
---
out of all seriousness that was an overkill statement, lol. at the end i usually get like 3-6 each time not including what i find along the way. i just do the event so much is just feels like i get that many
---
I want plots to plant things in nice rows.
---
20 like-minded individuals is a horrible sample pool.
---
Founded by several of them, yes.
---
Hmmm not 100% but I think it's actually silent.
---
Edit: yep, it's silent
---
The wolf horde doesn't, but its precursor, Leader of the Pack, gives 3. 
---
They're all 1*s, but they're great for low levels and scripping.
---
In my opinion, Just let them keep it if they say no. Ask for resources because its' common courtesy to leave all of the miners unlocked and free to take. I remember one time me and a friend held the junkyard (I wasn't even level 25 and he was on his level 19 alt). Here comes this guy with the camo mutation, Marsupial and a goddamn explosive submachine gun. Just claims it from us out of nowhere and, since my CAMP was nearby, began just farming us for all of our caps. Kept trolling me at least for days afterwards. Don't do things like this folks - You ruin the already hardness of the game.
---
Stop complaining. You get the best power armor in the game from the raid. It’s not meant for mid level players. Raids are for high level players that are dedicated to overcoming  a raids’ difficulty.
---
I still fully agree with whoever said there should be a log-in bonus
---
Betheda's never been real consistent with things... There are a number of bloody skeletons around, as well as at least one room that looks like it was torched. There's also radroaches found on site, so it's more likely they would be responsible for the stripped skeletons.
---
I mean I suppose it's possible that Scorched would eat people... I presume they still have to eat something.
---
I'll check the game files later to be sure, it's been a few months since I dug around for that particular thing so I want to be sure I'm not remembering incorrectly.
---
What, you *dont* want someone getting off of a private server with enough fusion cores to crash the economy?
---
Me and my squad were down in cranberry bog doing the ground to air quest ( dunno if I named it right lol), completed it but thought it was strange that no SB's turned up throughout the whole quest.
---
Walked up into the mire when all hell broke loose, ambushed by 3 SB's then as the fight progressed another two turned up for shits n giggles before we could dispatch the first 3.
---
Experience was unreal but by hell I wouldn't want to repeat it anytime soon lol
---
Maybe you're just looting too fast, sometimes legendaries take a bit to show up in the list.
---
The 3 wolfs always drop legendaries
---
OK, I see what you were getting at, sorry.
---
you sure he didn't have any healing active?  Mayhaps he healed some health as you were damaging him, stims heal over time.
---
I just want more items that are not raider and free state related....
---
Whats your gamertag
---
Yea, I figured they used different models for first and 3rd just didnt know what it did to their third person if you messed with the first. Either way it's a simple model tweak. I still dont know if just the dot could be changed or not, I'm assuming so though since there is a circle and dot reticle but maybe it still is the same entity so when chameleon is activated it does the model in its entirety. They might just have to make it so the sight itself is visible in first but not third. I still think there would be complaining but at least you could aim.
---
A little punctuation goes a long way toward people giving a fuck about what you have to say.
---
The strangler power armor is great in pve and pvp..
---
I’ll do a Price Check and average it out-and I’ll sell to you for less. I’ve seen 8k before though-maybe it’s changed. I think it’s the second or third rarest behind red obviously.
---
fixer or handmade will do everything if you want just 1 gun.
---
If you really want the "best" you probably want a lever or gauss for range, and then a fixer or handmage for cqc.
---
Lol yeah a level 140 something followed me around for 20 mins. I was lvl 10 he just kept shooting at me.
---
People may try to grief at the end of the event since there is flux you can drop at death.
---
If you've never owned the armor then you're just speculating as to how you were killed quickly. It's a myth and you just got bodied and blamed it on a my th you heard.
---
All over the place.  My guess is that they don't despawn with somebody's CAMP, so after a player leaves, a shell of their collectron stay's behind, doing nothing.  It's too bad we can't decorate them.  Maybe we should start doing selfies with them?
---
I mean, the majority of people who show up to the SBQ battle are still in PA.
---
Yes, non-PA builds can often carry more and deal way more damage, but PA also confers these benefits right out-of-the-box.  There's no need to spec around them, or try to collect a bunch of Legendaries to do it.
---
One set that the quest to get it is bugged at the moment,  wow my whole argument is nol and void!
---
I frequently connect FO76 from 3G on mobile.
---
- runs ok...  some lag but manageable for PVE
---
Fallout 76: Pacific Rim Edition, now including more giant legendary enemy spawns!!
---
i too have never seen one that was legendary other than the Queen. guess it depends on the region. in that specific quarry the most i have seen was a mirelurk Queen, legendary colony gusty and legendary sentry bot... if i remember correctly there were not fighting each other so i snuck my way around.... i was too much of a coward for that
---
This is a really great and informative post. I disagree with only one point, escorting your pet. In my experience, every time I've escorted it home, it spawns in high level enemies which make quick work of my low level pet. IIRC enemies automatically spawn and scale to your player level within so many blocks. So escorting a pet is sort of a death sentence if not at least a tough road to go. Best experience has always been fast traveling home or hopping servers quick. I also opt to tame in random spawns nearest my camp to give them the best chance at making it home.
---
yeah mine was messed up too. glad to help, enjoy the new dress! :-)
---
It's great in pvp. The only thing I find it helpful on pve wise is scorched. And basically everything dies to quickly to matter anyway, and on high health enemy's I can't lay into them without fear of crashing
---
But PA is nessisary for a heavy gunners, since stabilised is a great perk. But I do wish I could be out of PA, legendary effects are quite nice
---
How is it bugged if I know multiple people who have it lol? The raid is  not perfect sure but entirely doable
---
Oh my god, this. I shouldn't see something I like the look of in the Atomic Shop and then wait until someone talks about it on reddit to see if it's actually worth buying. I shouldn't be depending on someone else spending THEIR atoms to find out if it's worth spending MY atoms. I didn't buy the Mothman statue. Why? I didn't know how it worked. I didn't buy the Vault-Tec double wide stairs because someone on reddit said that it clipped and didn't look good. Same with the greenhouse dome. It's a really terrible system.
---
Someone ages ago suggested that there should be an actual shop you can go to. Think of it: outfits on mannequins so you can see them in the actual game. Appliances and generators out on display. You would have known the vault tec generator was silent because you would have seen it! Now, I understand that this might be more programming than they might want to do every time they add something new to the shop, but better demonstrations in the atomic shop would go a loooooong way.
---
Vendor doesn't have enough caps to complete this transaction. Please return in (timer).
---
Adding the "please return in x" would be enough. Now it's just "please try again later". 
---
This is an hour or two one afternoon coding, tops!
---
Heavy weapons benefit from PA. Plus there's rad resistance,  general high DR, and mods.
---
The crash isnt from damage stack, that another part of the myth. It's from the particle effects stacking and overlaying itself with each one having it's own shadows. I use I BE gatling plasma with a beam splitter and stangler heart and can tell you that your theory is inaccurate.
---
This movie will always be super scary to me, probably because it was the first scary movie I ever saw (too bad you can’t recreate the chicken leg scene...nightmares!). Well done, thanks for my goose-bumpy nostalgic hit.
---
If they allow unhindered transfer between private and public i will get a private server and forget about the market. To me the market is fun and rewarding. I spend more time grinding for resources to sell then actually doing quests or events. Fusiin cores would be 1 cap which is great for public servers i guess lol. Im waiting to see what limits they put on it. I would like to see the economy stay healthy.
---
Thank you.
---
I kill anything much faster in strangler than out from my use compared to all other PA
---
2 shot explosive weapons (Grenade/missile launcher, fatman) are great since they do true double damage. The 2 shot +25% damage only adds to the projectiles not the resulting explosions.
---
In line with this: a cooking overhaul so that rarer, harder to craft recipes provide greater benefits and there should be perks and Special (Charisma maybe) which give benefits to crafted food.
---
This would allow a restaurant and cook build, which would be epic to stumble across. Imagine someone playing just to gather ingredients and make the best food in the wastes, giving huge benefits (more food, water for the weight and buffs).
---
There is a outdoor bar on a hill in toxic vallet that is fun to build around.
---
 At work atm so cant check map to be less vauge on location.
---
The scout masks used to be for sale in the WS bunker.
---
Lvl 700 player here. The advice of "complete the objective of the event" isnt shit. If no one takes pylons then the event will fail, period.
---
Since you're a higher level player your experience is more unique, more casual players often times spend more ammo/stims then they've gained from the raids in the raids since players who've been playing for longer have more access to top tier weaponry they use up less ammo and take less damage.
---
That being said I personally do not think the raids provide anything close to the amount of ammunition production any single player can do without the assistance from others if they know what they're doing. Especially since the ammo kits + gun powder are a once a day thing. If you cleared all three difficulties it would be decent scrap but still it would still be entirely dependent on the skill level of the team you had and their speed.
---
If players don't want to learn the raids due to the rewards being lack luster initially they won't get the speed needed to make that any more profitable than their solo grinding. Plus the difficulty of getting a team together should provide more rewards than a *slight* increase in ammo producing junk then standard for maybe an hour or so? Seems lack luster.
---
Edit: As for the rewards being unique are you talking about the power armor that requires 28 vault steel per piece despite the fact players can only earn a total of 12 per day? Meaning players would have to clear all three difficulties which is already repetitive but they have to do so 3 days in a row to craft a single piece? Of six? Making it roughly 2 weeks of playing the raids or roughly 45 clears? Of which players can't even select which raid quest they're doing? For players who can only do standard the time effectively doubles. Plus the PA causes other people's game to crash so that reward isn't the greatest. As for the legendary set bonuses most people would rather do their normal clears since its less of a hassle.
---
Vats crit.
---
it's the alpha damage assault rifle in the game that also happens to have some of the easiest to learn mods thanks to it using a combat rifle as it's base weapon.  In it's base configuration it's highly AP efficient to boot.
---
As an aside comparing a fixer to a combat shotgun is apples and oranges.  You don't really know how a fixer compares unless you have a build that leverages it.  If you have a shotgun build you are high str and probably don't have all the perception you need to properly use the fixer.
---
Gotcha, I’ll add that
---
I don’t think you understand what I’m saying, why are you keeping Chems and Stims (meds) In your stash, you do realize with traveling pharmacy it is easier to store them on your person thus opening up 200lbs of space In your stash. I’m also getting the 200 figure from what you said earlier that you had worth of chems In your stash. Clearly you aren’t understanding something.
---
I think power armor is actually really balanced how it is, it’s so easy to get that more casual players can get themselves some great damage resistance and carry weight bonus without having to grind out legendary armor
---
I, too, have a decorating problem with plants. Why do they take up so much space?? I got rid of my cow, my garden, and upgraded to the fusion generator (so I would only need one). I built in the forest so I wouldn't need turrets. So why, Bethesda, is my camp still at max budget? It's three rooms and a porch! The whole thing is MAYBE 8 squares!
---
I had a goal of making an old-timey saloon with a brothel upstairs but sadly my budget couldn’t handle my unladylike vision. 
---
To answer your question tho, I would think by the side of a road not to far from a busy place...like one of the towns.
---
I used it with the pioneer scout outfit back when it first came out too, worked pretty good!
---
Mine was a 4 way fight in the mire I was part of, it was 9 supper mutants, 1 strangler Grafton monster, 1 scorchbeast, and one me with several heavy guns and power armor
---
Idk. It's just so weird. I'm generally more of a "soft voice, big stick" kinda guy with the big stick being the Unstoppable Monster/Queen Beasty's Bane and the soft voice being no voice at all. Lol
---
They should also include atoms with some dailies so those who don't have many ways to earn can do so. But I am also of the opinion that it will be less.
---
It's one of the things I hope they DO bring back. They didn't bother to mention it on the store page, so I don't have it, either.
---
The movie still gives me goosebumps too. Maybe I need to get a chicken for a camp pet 😂
---
Ok, what's with the location numbering in that diagram?  It's a great diagram, but #1 is in the bottom right, #2 is across the map???  And so forth...
---
This is a great post though. Keep em coming!
---
Log in bonus would reward those who play alot, i like that idea
---
I would also like to know how it's bugged? I ran it yesterday just fine. And have ran all 3 raids many times without to much issue, other than some occasional lag
---
So lucky! I got mine from Boomer's daily.
---
Have fun! The adrenaline kick is amazing.
---
I got 3 Broadsiders from her today, one was 2 shot with -90% weight so there's that at least.
---
Nuka Grape is best Nuka!
---
Stabilized.  Need I say more?
---
What platforms are you two on? When i last tried it on Xbox it was bugged and I remember people taking about it.
---
Xbox
---
What i did in the beginning was go into my ps4 memory setting and uninstall the game.
---
Ok awesome thanks! I should be able to get 8k by the end of the week. I work in the home construction business and our area had a tornado last night so we are kinda swamped. I'm lucky they don't need me today. I'll let you know what I get after tonight
---
Man, I gotta figure out what this "server hopping" thing is, I see people talk about. I'm on XBox. I log in, choose Adventure, and I'm on a server. Not sure how the jumping around from server to server happens in that process... gotta go do some YouTubing...
---
Congrats mate! Hope you enjoyed the ride, here’s to another 200!
---
You're right, they didn't. But you had to find this stuff. You had to leave Sanctuary or Doc Martin's office and go FIND that weapon and armour. And then carefully use your level ups. Not to use the weapon you had picked up, but to be able to use it effectively. And sometimes those perks were locked behind a level up you had to wait for. I'm not going to use my rifle when my shotgun does more damage. But perhaps, at level 17 the roles will reverse when I get that rifle perk.
---
And Last of Us 2
---
They announced in an ITV it was delayed until 2020
---
I believe it's going to be included in Wastelanders
---
There is a Gatling gamma in the game already, SB's :P
---
(Similar visual effect anyway!)
---
Delayed to q1 of next year, along with wastelanders, perk load outs, and most new content they have mentioned
---
That's why we are making post and coming up with ideas to make the game the way we want it to be. Hopefully we can make it happen. I don't like sitting on stuff. I like to make it go away and make money to get stuff I really need.
---
Delay means this game is dead for another 6 months. 2 people will check wastelanders after so much time: Person who still cares about this game and Todd Howard's mom. 
---
Don't get me wrong, game is amazing and i spent a lot of hours here, but 6 months is way too much. There is nothing to do now and no event or sale will change this. Game is already dead on twitch and player base shrinked so much and devs have to add p2v to pay for servers. Vault raids are disaster, nobody but cheaters plays nuclear winter. All summer content sucks and i cant believe any content before WL can be better. i don't trust Bethesda anymore and i don't know if i'll check WL after 6 damn months
---
It's also on sale on PSN so you can get it digitally too
---
Huh?  Are we playing the same game?
---
In the version I play, I'm a melee build.  I lived exclusively in Excavator from L45 to 140, including multiple SBQ battles, nuke zones, ore gathering, could carry up to 1700# and still sprint....
---
Seems pretty viable (and versatile) to me....
---
If there is transferring between public and private servers I'm definitely going to rent my own.  Without a text chat I don't communicate with any other players anyway.
---
 Having my own server to loot what I want and kill what I want sounds worth it to me.  Not having to worry about any low level players spawning low level enemies and such.  
---
 I hope to hell there are no cross transfers between private and public modes though. Transferring to a private server then being locked into that server is fine but going back-and-forth between private and public just does not sound like a good idea. 
---
 Being able to transfer between survival and adventure modes absolutely killed survival on day one. It never had a chance to succeed.  Here's to hoping to developers learn from their terrible mistakes but I highly doubt it with this crew.
---
Wait, were they actually blunderbusses or are you just using that as a general term for black powder weapons? Because I was under the impression the blunderbuss can't be legendary.
---
Just started playing this last week, this exactly describes my first encounter with another player. I was claiming the workshop at the airforce base in the starting area, having no idea what I was doing, but being very excited about all of the loot I just found. A couple of guys jump there, do wave emotes, invite me to a team, while one is crouched above with rifle sighted on me. I figured they were just being cautious. I accept the team invite, BOOM one-shotted.
---
Second encounter was guy messaging me that his plans were on sale for 1 cap each. I traveled to his camp, got them, fast traveled out, no problem. Sent him a thank you.
---
First one had me a bit worried about the community though, especially after hearing about how great it is, and being a clueless new player. I now mostly try to stay away from other players.
---
Was the Radium rifle on the list? 
---
🤞for response.
---
People quit playing which means less people playing, less servers being created. Shit doesn't respawn until the server restarts.
---
&gt;Its literally the definition of let me kill someone by sneezing in their direction
---
It's not my fault you aren't vaccinated.
---
(It's a joke, before someone gets offended.)
---
13 as he gave him one of his keycards...to nuke his own camp.  I'm sorry, but I can't stop laughing!!  You're a good man!!
---
Delayed as all other stuff...
---
I ALMOST didn't stay until the end. Totally worth it
---
I think we have seen a trend of partially fulfilled commitments, slow response time and general lack of attention towards fixing (and keeping fixed) a range of things.
---
I also would like to hear an update on the prestige system that was discussed. This could be the end game content that would satisfy for the duration.
---
Par for the course for Bethesda? Maybe all those ghouls at Whitesprings Golf Course have made things more challenging for them.
---
I own the armor and refuse to use it in PvP because it's OP and can't use it in PvE because people want to play on the servers they connected to.
---
I had extensive discussion as well as testing of these armors done with the opponents that wielded them. I had my build readjusted so I can fight stranglers without a strangler myself.
---
I'm not one to speculate how did I die quickly. I'm one to research it.
---
Each damage hit gave tiny poison stack that ticks 7 times. One second of plasma Gatling fire was enough to apply few dozens of those stacks. One bullet from handmade did little damage. Initially, one shot from harpoon required two stimpacks to come out alive.
---
I said I haven't retested this because last time I fought stranglers was on survival.
---
at 300 your character will start grunting and saying no then explode and be wearing excavator power armor and all your perks will switch to a food build setup.
---
Have you fully explored morgantown?
---
Lol I was afraid I made it too long.
---
Coincidentally heavy weapons are the best for queen and high damage and rad resist is extremely useful there 🤔
---
I think it was listed in the camp item section.
---
I did similar tests and did not get these results at all.
---
Under a tatoo parlor is a good place I hear.
---
40k???
---
Go into a nuke zone without that useless PA
---
That's a good idea, it's less invasive. 
---
As for the coding, the change can literally hold in one line!
---
Or a vendor activity tab under stats that is a running tally.
---
And I still see this glitch in game, from time to time...
---
PS4
---
You: pain
---
Also you: pain that makes me more confident with social interaction
---
I wouldn't mind doing more for Atoms, but I get disappointed when I have to do 15 things for 10 atoms. At least make it 20-40 for time consuming things.
---
Survey gave me knowledge of the main issue with this game and private servers are enough of an answer to it. I'll use additional results to organise my private servers, and plan to have following PvP leagues: all allowed, no glitchguns, no teslabois, no legendaries.
---
I now use ridiculous 8 weapons.
---
BE25 railway, semi, PvP manual
---
B1025 handmade, semi, PvP manual
---
B10A plasma, sniper, PvP manual
---
B25 tesla, auto, PvP manual
---
BE laser, auto, PvP manual
---
BE25 combat, auto, PvP/PvE VATS
---
B25 gamma, PvP manual
---
B5025 .38 pipe rifle, PvE VATS, silenced for cheap and easy trash clearing - this is only silenced gun I have.
---
I have 0 weapon reduction perks nor armor, and I never finished the backpack bullshit so only have small backpack. I need team to be able to sprint xD
---
Heard of strangler heart and a Bloodied GP?
---
I have no idea, it's a map I found and I'm going to remake because holy moly; it's got no rhyme or reason to it
---
Log out of the game and log back in. Simple as that. Puts you in a new server usually, but not always. Look at some player camps/names and see if they're still there when you log back in. This helps when trying to find certain plans as well. For instance there's a train car between Watoga Station and the repair yard to the west. There's sometimes an armor/underarmor plan sitting in a crate in there. If you find one, but not the one you want, don't pick it up. Server hop and see if it's changed to the plan you want.
---
Bethesda mismanaged this game and now they are in the position where Wastelanders has to make FO76 a 9/10 type game or it’s going to get left behind.  Cyberpunk looks dope and it is an iconic RPG.  But there’s also Last of Us 2 around the same time... oh and maybe a few people have heard of another single player game coming out around the same time: the remake Final Fantasy 7.
---
So I hope Wastelanders delivers because I doubt this game has much of a future if not.
---
What’s a crit? Sorry I haven’t played other fallouts 😫
---
It's on sale in Canada, too. I just checked the PS store, and it's 40% off, which brings it to $32.99 CAD (originally $54.99)
---
Timed raids and no matchmaking are the reasons I don't play them.
---
I cannot stand timed content. It is the dumbest and laziest way to implement content difficulty.  I also cannot stand developers that make group content and don't add any features in game to find groups or even text chat another player to make a group.
---
 They are pretty much the reason I don't want to log in anymore. If they are a sign of end game content to come, It's just not for me.
---
It's the 3rd effect listed.  👀
---
They will be adding a new form of premium currency that you cannot earn in game called Tricky Todd's Fun Bucks.
---
I agree they desperately need devs with PvP metagame balance experience.
---
That said nothing will please everyone, and imo pvp has way more problems than what you've stated.
---
The game was built on a 100% pve foundation.  So many items are not really thought out for pvp.  Stealthboys, nuka quantums, pretty much all healing items, pretty much every ap consumable, teslas, legacies, assasins/sent/cavs, and vats are all imbalanced for pvp.  I'm probably forgetting a bunch of things.
---
A good pvp game can be made from the base we have but Bethesda doesn't seem to have the inclination or resources to do it.  There's a reason why NW started from scratch and has completely different balance than the base game.  
---
I like PvP in this game but there's many cases when you face people who just leverage every last cheese tactic and it just becomes really uninteresting really fast.
---
Edits are a thing 😜
---
I think I have the Whitespring jumpsuit and the white powder one.... didn’t know they were rare.
---
This is interesting and I will retest this today.
---
When your vats bar fills up you can perform a critical hit. 
---
Crit = critical
---
Hello, PC friend! My name in-game is the same as here, and I would be happy to watch your back!
---
If you didn't get it before about 2 hours ago you missed it. The Modern Art was part of the stretch rewards from the "Cleaning Appalachia" that finished a few hours ago.
---
Sounds good. I’ll leave the Price Check up for a bit to get a fair idea. And you want it to wear right? Not resell? I can tell you really want it so I’m willing to sell a couple thousand under the average go-for price if you want it to wear and not to sell. If you get a hold of a Forest Camo Jumpsuit I’ll just straight up trade.
---
Yeah, I've always just waited until the same time the next day. Now I know I can do it a little earlier if need be.
---
I just hope they read things, even though this Reddit sub is a small portion of the overall player base, it's still a good sampling of the more avid players that drive the longevity of games like this.
---
Yeah I had to step up the game after you 3:0'ed me :D
---
Thank you, so I just wait for the white bar turns full then pull the trigger?
---
im sure other people will say this, but PA is still the best for heavy weapons
---
I've had pretty varied returns on my scrips overall, but there was one server in which I got three Gatling lasers in a row. I don't know how that works honestly.
---
You do you man. I dont think its OP when you consider what it takes to get it and also when compared to the meta legendaries everyone is using.
---
I have a boom mic just for online gaming.  People have said "oh shit you were talking, I thought that was in-game audio!"
---
I'm dressed as the Silver Shrooouuuud, and I always do the voice.
---
Once the bar if full there is a certain button you have to press before you use your critical hit. It's a different button on each system.  It should say somewhere down at the bottom of the screen when you are in vats.
---
Sometimes bodies disappear to where they spawned in at
---
I get what you're saying, but I always try to farm these events so i never kill the alpha quickly. Seems I'm just mixing up different events
---
Great video lol
---
couple of options: 
---
Since the WS critters will chase you, sometimes the body goes back to the spawn point.
---
Or 
---
it was bug.  
---
I killed a 3\* in the laundry blg parking lot.  Body immediately poofed.
---
Commence grid search of the parking lot.  At one spot (no corpse or meatpile), the loot window popped up on screen, then immediately disappeared. I froze, slow panned the cursor around.  Finally hit the pinpoint speck just right, loot window full of goodies stayed on sreen.
---
body never appeared.
---
The world needs more happy endings.
---
Right, didn't realise they were separate events. Ta
---
Oh i see, thank you! (PS4) 👍🏻
---
Four Blunderbuss rifles, and two of the pistols, I'm pretty sure... All 3-star.
---
I didn't know that Blunderbuss's 'couldn't be legendary'....?
---
Nice!!!
---
Egads. That's so obvious... I can't believe I didn't think of it... sheesh....
---
You are welcome. I play on PS4 too, I believe it is triangle.
---
The only thing that needs changed with the raids IMO is the lag. We run them as a group of 2 and thus far have only completed two of the three missions in standard mode. I'm okay with failing because of our own stupid mistakes, but I absolutely hate failing when we have 45 seconds left on a clock and a door just won't open. 
---
As others have said the raids are not casual content. Eventually I will get the armor and enough vault steel to craft it, but it is not a high priority of mine. I run them for the bulk ammo scrap and the acid. The bonus legendary drops are nothing to scoff at either. 
---
I'm beyond happy that we actually have something to work at.
---
Yeah im talking about the wolf pack leader quest in the forest :P
---
I’m pretty happy they never followed me up. Must have stayed stuck in the floor!
---
yes! thats always 3 legendary for me. theres 3 packs of 4 and every leader has a lvl 5 of 10 1star. the other 3 have nice meat tho
---
lol true! and it restarts pretty often.
---
The raids are not for a solo player. The raids are not for casual players. The raids are for players who have mastered their build, mastered their resource management, have a team of like-minded players, and are thirsty for new challenging endgame content with unique rewards. Standard runs and novice runs take no time, and a well executed expert run takes even less time...because it is timed. Employ stealth to save ammo, use melee. That’s not your build? Get a teammate who uses it and strategize. You seem to be asking for more rewards for less work and to make the vault raids accessible to casual solo players. That would undermine them as endgame content. If they were any easier than they are currently some of us high levels wouldn’t have anything left to grind. Not every part of this expansive game world is designed for every player. A ton of the content is already geared towards “average” players, we need this sort of challenging stuff. Final point, “standard” difficulty doesn’t mean “for the average player”, it means standard in relation to the novice and expert difficulty settings. All of the raid difficulty levels are designed for an expert level player, not a causal.
---
It's incredible how many items from previous games are already in the game (and the requested function existed in previous titles already too) that we didn't get as CAMP items yet
---
More scorched is all, every one still succumbs to the scorched plegue
---
South of the abandoned bog town to the right of the road behind a broken shack is a junk plot.
---
Basically I just want to play Stardew Valley, but in Fallout.
---
I’ll give it a try when I get home 👍🏻So essentially you have to press triangle first before you can pull the trigger, is that correct? For automatic weapons do you press the triangle for each bullet?
---
I tried with the horde events, but someone always came in and killed the alpha.
---
Leader of the pack has a time limit tho, so you're kinda forced to kill em quickly.
---
Yes this was on my mind too!! I was hoping for some more cooking based perk cards, I know there's super duper but that's not even that good. 
---
Also I wish food could last longer than 30 mins to an hour. 
---
Ex: Fasnacht donuts are a nice food because they never spoil, but they take a ton of ingredients and only make ONE donut
---
Tuesdays and Thursdays is when info, patches, updates and news comes out
---
Each rank of Hard Bargain is basically +3 Charisma. 25 Charisma is the maximum sell and discount price you can achieve currently.
---
The terror is constant.
---
Haha yeah I liked the atmosphere but it was too limited for my liking.
---
There are bugs in adventure mode where the numbers shown aren't accurate. Could be the case here.
---
Roselyn would have found some other way to die.
---
Is this still being updated cause if so I'll help out by looking for spawn points.
---
Yeah, most 76 players are friendly. Even the non-friendly ones are harmless if you leave pacifist mode on. Just dont accept random team invites and you'll be fine.
---
Bare minimum, they should have a headset so you can actually converse with them before joining.
---
They got your money, now they need to reduce server costs.
---
Lol it's OP #1 3rd star
---
There's a frat house with all of them on a shelf sometimes
---
Thanks I had alot of fun with it lol
---
What you’re saying is the equivalent of “I can’t solo the SBQ so they need to lower her hit points to make her rewards more accessible”. That undermines the event as a multiplayer, high level challenge.
---
Sounds interesting, I'll have to see if I can find it.
---
It’s far from the only competition.  Last of Us 2 and the remake of Final Fantasy 7 are scheduled Q1 releases.
---
I wanna say the nuka shine one?
---
Lolol it took until 1pm for the discount to start on the day, and i log in at 9:30am today... regular pricing. Lol thanks Bethesda
---
Yes you press triangle before you fire or swing. You only get one before you have to fill your bar up again.  As for automatics I am assuming you only get one but I don't play automatic so I'm not sure.
---
There are also a lot of vats perks to improve your crits and fill up your bar faster.
---
Would be convenient if Merchants restocked when the dailies refreshed.
---
Agreed. My community decided to start doing weekly podcasts talking about 76 in an effort to get discussion flowing. I'm actually pretty confident this thread/post will get discussed this week cause it has raised some good points.
---
" Love Heart emotes, toxic emotes, finger guns, you name it you did it, chuckling over your mic like the ignorant imbecile I had come to realise you were"
---
NOTHING PERSONEL KID
---
Do you have a mic?
---
A place with an extractor dispenser, ores near around, water and an object type spwsn (which contain sleeping sheepsquatch, crashed vertibert, 2 deathclaws fighting 8 super mutants with miniguns etc) near the crashed plane in the mire.
---
Kinda what I was thinking though I'd love to be able to hide it within something (like a building or cave idk) to give it more of the hidden speakeasy feel.
---
Yeah thats really dissapointing
---
Oh I see
---
Thanks
---
It's all about the massive investors sticking their fingers in bethesda's sweet little money making hole.
---
Was pushed until the next decade.
---
My main is 125ish, but I could always switch to my level 15-20ish alt.
---
It was a weekend sale, be glad they even started on Thursday instead of waiting until Friday
---
Ah, so that's what happened to me.
---
I just bought the Tricentenial steelbook edition for xbox on ebay for 19.99 plus tax with free shipping. Thought it was a pretty good deal. Forgot to add that the game is brand new.
---
Where do you find the baseball bats?
---
Lolol
---
Fair enough, the mike check is great advice. Thank you!
---
We can do this already. Just not with the "Player terminal" we own. So you'd think that would be an easy thing to add.
---
Eta psi i believe
---
PS store is always overpriced. You get the disc version for half that price or less.
---
Exactly. And rather than just loading in a single holotape, have it so there is a library of every game you have.
---
I have a biiiig problem with my comic store because of that actually. Some people buy stuff so fast while im in the middle of a raid or something, and i get back wanting to know which bobbleheads and mags i need to replace.
---
That's probably the greatest story I've heard, I'm gonna share this to r/PKOA if that's ok with you as we are a Fallout community too that I'm sure would get a laugh or two out of this cause this is brilliant lol guy probably didn't know where to Nuke so thought it would be funny to Nuke yours ya little bastard lol 
---
I'm usually a lone wolf as well it's the main reason I love Fallout other than the big impact it had on me regarding my step dad (he got me into it) Fallout to me is a game I can just relax and do whatever and I love the game for that made better with my family at PKOA (feel free to join too)
---
Yeah I had my camp there for a while and there was usually at least 1 legendary at the north cabin over a couple hours of play. I never counted but 1 in 10 sounds about right from my experience too
---
You are correct,  PA is useless, but only if you are using a sneak vats build. 
---
PA is the best thing you can do to survive nuke zones.
---
PA is almost required for an endgame heavies build.
---
It’s great for me 
---
I now have time to re play the core game on PC and rebuild my progress in time for release 😉
---
The splatter paints from Nuka World for handmades and such. I'd love to have that.
---
Good question, I couldn't answer that till I went back and watched my own video so thank goodness I attached it. LOL
---
No, I was not in power armor.
---
I looked everywhere that they came from and the whole area, I jumped on a roof when they first showed up so I killed them pretty much where they spawned and nothing it sucks, I've finally got some better things out of the machine since the sale and was hoping the drops would be better as well
---
Yeah. I'm inclined to think the "no NPC" or "other players as the NPCs" concept was a brave but foolish choice. It goes along with the failed thinking that putting everyone on open mic would increase immersion. It was a bold vision.
---
They are. The lookout tower in the main camp lifts up to reveal a hidden vault beneath. They've been in there eating smores this whole time
---
Near guley mine and arkos pharma is an acid pool. I use to mine the shiiiite outta that spot.
---
Should have Chally Talk to Grahm about that one time he slaughtered sammy the megasloth for no reason!!!!!
---
Or at least have it at the bottom by default and give us an option to filter up if we want
---
What are small backs
---
They're just Gary.
---
I would not consider the group I play with to be "Like Minded" by any stretch of the imagination.
---
It’s been bugged since fallout 4. There is also a conduit item with a similar issue that was carried over from 4.
---
Haven’t heard anything from Bethesda since release so I wouldn’t count on a fix anytime soon.
---
There we goooo!
---
Longshoreman coat with black eye paint
---
I personally use 3 ranks of gunsmith.
---
My special loadout is on my sniper is 3 15 1 4 7 15 11. How do you fit 6 points in endurance? My build is designed for PvE, so I invest very heavily into agility. Being nearly impossible to detect is my primary asset, with blocker/dodgy/serendipity making up my emergency defense. 
---
I suppose I could ditch demo expert rank 1 and ground pounder ( it works with all rifles, not just auto), but they do provide an appreciable DPS/defense boost that I don’t see in endurance.
---
i’ve seen that only once, where do you find it?
---
Probably una. Building nearby
---
If they are frequently together, and/or being polled in the same chat it directly impacts the results, and makes the poll results inherently biased.
---
I do not have issue with the raids being difficult I have issue with the rewards not matching the difficulty that come with the raids. I personally have completed every single raid on expert mode. Was it that difficult? Without the current latency issues not really imo, but did I get anything interesting for it? Again not really imo, as someone who uses melee/heavy weapons primarily I'm already extremely ammo efficient I don't care for the ammo. At some points I offered to craft ammo for others or was flat out dropping tens of thousands of rounds since *I just didn't need it*. I don't use PA often even with heavy weapons and the RNG on the legendary armor is *god awful.* Now the rewards didn't fit my play style boo hoo me right? Yet I struggle to find people still doing the raids nowadays. Since again *the difficulty doesn't match the rewards.* If the rewards were better **more** casual players would **strive** to start doing the raids but as it stands not even many high end players do them.
---
Oh my god that ending. Hilarious, but I bet so frustrating!
---
My understanding is that in PVP Adventure mode combat, all weapons are considered to be max level for damage calculation purposes (for PVP only).   
---
In theory, a level 6 player with a level 5 10mm pistol is doing damage to a level 100 player as if the 10 mm was a level 45...   
---
Where this idea falls apart is in the perk selection and legendary effects (not available to low level players), as well as the failure of "one shot" damage caps meant to "balance PVP", but resulting in nerfing all slow fire rate weapons and making it so that ROF weapons with DR Armor sets rule the world.   
---
Sigh.
---
They spawn in drop boxes like the one at the airport, they can be found as world loot or they drop from varies mobs definitely rarely
---
Edit:the town monogah has a caged storage area with a terminal you can hack that spawns a bat, If you don’t pick up the bat and I believe if you server hop you might be able to spawn in a rare color 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
It's a joke peice.....BECAUSE I'D NEVER SALE MY BABYYY!!
---
Can you not apply the atom shop skins to the small backpack? Also it would take away the incentive to do their shitty grindy tadpole quests
---
I used full green face smudge with red eye band... i a turle ninja guy.
---
Sweet thank you!
---
Arktos Pharma backpack works with the small one
---
I agree that it was the dream, but then they didn't build the tools or structure to make any of that happen. PvP was (is) inbalanced. Vending, trading, and chat weren't in place. Social tools are still severely lacking. We're still using account names instead of character names. 
---
It's odd that they took the players-as-NPCs too far, and yet not far enough.
---
I have multiple characters and one with 8 intelligence for crafting needs.
---
This allows me to get int down to 3.
---
A little outdated but me: https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/imprezobus/
---
I'll update it to current one once I finish the experiments
---
Lol @Amazon(AU) PC is $99.00+ $8.50 delivery
---
Thank goodness. Lol I have a beauty Junkie's shovel with 90% Reduced weight as well.
---
I did the same!
---
Yeah that’s a bug lmao, I always see scorched called like protectron and grafton monster and shit lmao. It’s funny
---
I wish they had not introduced the small backpack at all personally.
---
I don't see why the Atomic Shop skins shouldn't apply to small backpacks too, especially when they literally use the same base model. Probably just Bethesda either forgetting about it or trying to entice players to earn the normal backpacks.
---
Wow What A Player
---
That build looks excellent for pvp. You know what you’re doing.
---
I would love Autumn's duster from 3, along with the Enclave officer uniform from 3 and the combat helmet from the orginals!
---
Did you find the solution , i have the same problem on my ps4
---
For that particular encounter I always assumed it was a traveling merchant from else where in the world who was just coming to Appalachia....then horrifically getting murdered.
---
Or a way to scroll in pages or groups of 10 or so
---
Below u/Panickedsoul tries to argue that strangler armor is not OP, calling truths myths and myths truths.  
---
The main line of argumentation he presented is that they don't work like they work, and that its fair they are OP since they are hard to gain.  
---
Below I present a video showing how I use character with no perks, shoot once from a shotgun at the target located in long distance, and take him from 241 hp to 0 in one shot. The shotty is QE DB.

STOP LYING.
---
Stop lying.
---
I'm ok with it. If you dont want to be basic, do the quest. 🤷‍♂️ This is coming from a basic boy with a small back pack... but I'm close to getting the real one. I appreciate that the people who grind out the quest get to look cooler and have more utility than those who made there way to the Morgantown Airport. But ofcourse I've played mom's all my life and dont agree with the new age thinking that everything should be easily obtained for everyone (which seems to be very common way of thinking in the FO76 community, so downvote away). Fortunately, Bethesda is forward thinking and gave us a small back pack participation trophy.
---
They actually work with the small backpacks?
---
This is exactly what I'm talking about. We should hear exactly what they feel about our issue instead of copy and paste before saying have a nice day. They are human beings and should give us human responses and not scripts given to them.
---
It's my pleasure and I hope we can make the game better by pointing out Bethesda's flaws.

LOL you sir still give Bethesda too much credit, I haven't seen a single update going back to beta this time last year that did not run like shit and wasn't near impossible to complete due to lag or bugs this will be no different. All I want is my damn events back and them to stop going P2W but I'm sure I will never see either of those things again. Glad I got to play the first 6 months when this game had a future. (The Ever Upwards add-on was the best DLC they added and half of it couldn't be completed until months later.)
---
Ooooooh that's what happened... i just thought i missed my chance to go in...
---
The raid is meant for a squad of 50 plus level players, so no I dont forsee them tweaking the raids because it's not supposed to cater towards the casual crowd. You dont even need to be min maxed to run them, they arnt very hard. It's a resource sink to attain the best armors in the game, don't try and water it down to appeal to people that wont put the work in for it. The veterans need something aside from daily and weekly challenges to keep them playing. I assume the next vault raids will be the same way. They're fine just how they are.
---
I’d get a lever and a handmade.
---
True! I actually didn't think of that, so good point!
---
Well I'm rock hard..
---
Yeah because it would be all teeth and you know it.
---
Not lying. Stop crying bevause you bought into a myth
---
Lolol soooo, to the people who went through this process unaware that it was a bug??? We just gonna hafta do it again? Lol
---
I'm basically already done playing for the week and I haven't even logged in today. Every character is loaded up with 3\* from the sale, most of which are just going to go back into the grinder.  Since I can only dump out 3, 3\* weapons per day (and then whatever I find in the wild for the other 30) it will take me a few days to get the weights back down.
---
Because if i knew there was a bug atm, i would not have tried it yet....
---
Yeah who cares. Hope the developers see you comment so they can make an even more shitty game for less cost, and take more money for it. Because who cares right? I guess you are right, no one cares. There was an attempt to make games good because they thought people out there cares, but you are right they don't. Elder scrolls 6 will be in 2nd and like paper mario.
---
That's because each pellet from a shotgun has a damage cap of 110 so you can one shot with it regardless of acid damage. That video doesn't prove your point.
---
Plitch bis there's a vid showing you're bullshitting attached to main line to cut with the crap.
---
Here its proof you're craptalking:

---
I've got to say, one of my low key favorite things on this game is to technically 'team' up with other enemies in the game to fight an alpha enemy. 
---
Yesterday, it was completely unintended but when I encountered a sheepsquatch near the Welch station, a small gang of super mutants joined the fray. Even though I find the squatch easy, they're damage sponges so I figured why not, finally make use of your dang missile launchers super mutants! But to my surprise, as I am hacking away at the squatch, the Mole Miners start to get involved. So, group of super mutants + group of mole miners + me vs. the sheepsquatch. I wish I could have taken a picture of this bonding moment.
---
Hmm pc version is still 36 bucks... what  am i missing?
---
Yeppers! I absolutely love the look lol
---
This begs the question, where is your camp located? Could it have been an accident or is your camp so secluded he obviously nuked your camp?
---
People downvoting you don't understand how time works.
---
Just something other than 5 mins of scrolling down lol
---
LoL really?
---
Does the bloody effect also increase the radiation damage on gamma guns?
---
Or they die in their spawn randomly for no apparent reason as you get close.
---
Jesus christ thats a relief
---
Lol. You're ridiculous. First, the character is not specced for anything, no perks, the shotgun itself did ~zero damage. Second, the health is going down from poison effect, over time. Third, shotguns don't deal any serious damage on this range, ever. Displayed number was '6'.  Stop being a bitch and admit to bullshitting.
---
110 damage per pellet without perks from shotgun on this distance. You are a lunatic.
---
It's just annoying as it currently is as you could load into the Railroad HQ in F4, the only reason I can think of is that they're worried about people exploiting their wonky code and finding a way to fast travel in before they complete the quest for the door keycard.
---
I had this happen in Watoga yesterday. During Monster Mash had a string of 3, 3* after killing them all three bodies disappeared. It was disappointing. Days ago had a glowing 3* robot explode &amp; disappear doing the Red Rocket cores. Actually had to kill a 4th robot to get the 3rd core.
---
[There were probably a dozen more out of frame...](https://imgur.com/66abjnS)
---
I set up camp there once, but just couldn't defend it against the level of baddies that spawned there. (My defenses are only level 1 turrets, walls, punji boards, etc.)
---
Im tankier in my PA build than I am my assassin sentinel lol might've had my perks all wrong at the time, also don't have dense mod unfortunately
---
My first nuke was at level 40, I did a solo run through silo alpha, once I got to launch the nuke, my target was two camps at whitesprings. Those two camps belonged to two level 160 players and surprisingly it was all worth the level and legendary grind at the end for all of us!
---
Y'all are idiots
---
They'll make much more money bringing back Liberty Prime after a hypothetical Wastelaners free week.
---
 But sure that doesn't mean they won't bring other stuff back before...
---
Rental Redbox machines have it as an option to purchase physical discs for $10.
---
You just don't get the actual FO76 case though.
---
I had to upvote this
---
Nice, what's your er and Dr in your set? With armored backpack I'm at 490 Dr and 506 er but I'm thinking since I don't have the dense mod it's making me way squishy
---
In bed
---
I just tried to build there last game, but there was some glitch, and all the Supermutants across the street were locked in position, and I couldn't shoot them. It was a weird glitch, and I didn't want to go through the work of building, just to have it crash.
---
Also, Scorchbeests tend to spawn just south of that location, and they wreck havoc on my poor camps. :-(
---
It'd take a bit more to function though, remember it's tied to the individual player and so would require additional work. Not just a text change :)
---
Last week. I did a lot of testing on a few handmades. Not only did I have problems with furious,  I never saw even the slightest damage difference between any of the different mags.
---
I hear you, brother. Was playing on a nuked Whitesprings servers couple nights ago trying to get legendaries to trade in for scrip. Made it 15 minutes in before I get disconnected for all my hard work. At this point I don’t even touch workshops and now nukes cause it’s so heartbreaking wasting time and resources on unstable servers.
---
I got to the point where I just log in to do my daily 150 scrip then shut the game off.
---
Great name for the Bloodied Explosive, just caught myself a Vampire’s 25%FR/MoveSpeed Gatling Lazer, decided to name it ‘Queen En’ Er’ Damn Undies’ after I walked a solid 100 units with my sights trained on her and burned about 6 FCs as well as the SBQ herself since i added the Gamma Wave Emitter right before the ‘Death From Above’ quest launched the nuke. Very happy with this one, since i cant have a BE version of this without it being legacy lol
---
I totally forgot about how psyced I was for this
---
It took me a while to come out of my shell as well, there were alot of hostile players when I was level 1-35, I was pretty convinced most people that played were jerks so I didn't bother helping anyone at all (or teaming up with anyone). I met a couple fellas that certainly helped me change my stance and opinion.
---
Once I surpassed level 50, I started dropping low level armor in front of Vault 76, with some ammo, and other Aid items as well. 
---
I figure just because there are others that will attack you on site, or try to sell you a level 5 Berserker's pipe wrench for 10K caps, doesn't mean you can't help anyone out. 
---
Other people can be jerks if they want, but the way I see it, we're all just out here trying to survive the wastes, so if I can help someone out, regardless of level, I try to.
---
Bit of a tip is that in current damage levels bloodied rifleman handmade mixed up with long shot and with no silencer deals 110 damage on ranges where VATS users cannot use VATS.
---
I'm now respeccing to use both rifleman and commando, depending on the position and enemy.
---
Replaced it with new ghoul pose: The Hover Crawl
---
Lmao

https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3I7i5lFBPRAUtXcNCZWYFJ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-meat-week-begins-again
---
See the QoL status update section and follow the Fallout Twitter or Facebook so you see these every Thursday.
---
Yes. Keep your mic on and hang around vault 76 or overseers camp. I can almost guarantee someone will join you and offer to help you.
---
Jeez. Someone lit a fire under your ass eh?  Devs dont care one bit if we like the game or not. Long as people buy it, their never gonna care. Money over quality.
---
I would love another Goris companion in a future game. Or maybe get a mod made of one
---
Right?! We can only make jokes like these rarely.
---
Everyday login atoms could do that too :D
---
Go tell that sentence of yours to the red dead redemption 2 subreddit and see what happens. Have a nice day.
---
What they said. The idea is that you can make your gear do most of the work for you and free up space for perks to make it a little easier on you.
---
Yes, I recommend it 100%. I imagine it's a lot better/easier for new players now than at the start.
---
I would see the orange pip boy returning just because it is orange.
---
No worries! I may be a little busy for a while tonight. I found someone willing to trade me for some Fixer plans
---
Similarly when challenge is kill X at place Y, make sure X actually spawns at Y every so often! Fallen foul of a few of these even with server hopping.
---
420, i love this game so far!
---
I've been DCed upwards of 50 times today. I legit have no clue what's going on. I used to have the occasional DC, every 1-4 hours, but this is just getting stupid.
---
Get started on the Tadpole scout badges sooner, rather than later (Pioneer Scout Camp in Toxic Valley). That way you don't have to repeat tasks that you've already done. Also, if you me up, Gumbybum21, I'd be happy to help you level up and mod your weapons/armor.
---
Anytime I have an Atom challenge for a specific event, the event never triggers.
---
Text = "Please return in `ceil(20 - PC.get_vendor_cooldown()/3600)` hours."
---
In any case it shouldn't be hard :)
---
It's called retirement mode.
---
You might wanna talk to the developers about this since they refer to it as DLCs. They seem to need your insight into their game.
---
I'd like a general area you can set as the fast travel spot, even one half of your build circle, but spawning at the base of a cliff is annoying, especially at my own camp. Although if you FT a second time it will generally place you very close to the vending machines, even if they're in some dumbass floating fortress.
---
You sure there isn’t a problem with your ISP?
---
I was on a lot that day. Nothing on my end. The next day? See it within an hour. This has happened quite often for me...
---
Where is everyone getting the idea I'm saying the vault raids should have lower difficulty? I haven't said that once, I'm saying the rewards need to better match the difficulty so high end players and mid level players would have more of a reason to do them. The rewards suck, I'm not the only one to state this.
---
probably the unstoppables too, eveything costumy
---
Just get the standard backpack. Takes about 2 hours lol
---
Athlete, mamologist, archer
---
No problem, man. Feel free.
---
I do actually have a small group that sometimes plays with me, but they play so seldom that I'm almost twice their combined level. Lol
---
Just DL a mod for whatever skin you want
---
Much better now. More stash space, easier to get caps, vendor bots have more caps available, player vendor machines, legendaries/scrip, plans more readily available, lots more info on wikis etc if needed. Also for a new player starting now, by not going too full on they may just run out of all the quests etc by the time Wastelanders drops!
---
They’re in an event

Bethesda [https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/group-people-laughing-lol-isolated-260nw-1390409888.jpg](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/group-people-laughing-lol-isolated-260nw-1390409888.jpg)
---
You one of those people that think they actually want you to earn atoms nice one.
---
Nobody likes a challenge anymore lol
---
First thing that springs to mind - What level are you? If you're under level 50, and/or still working your way through the main story, then I imagine certain areas and portions of the game might be "locked" to you still.
---
Lol im only a little level 65 though you should aww my camp AND that reminded me XD also feel free to join us we have members from all 3 platforms and many players
---
You're telling me, I got lucky the other day and got the Longshoreman's Outfit at Morgantown Train Station. I was like, F--KING FINALLY! 
---
Obviously someone sold it on mistake, but noone was around and I was not passing that up.
---
They at least need a listing for fusion cores, have seen some amazing deals on a few player vendors and trying to find some now
---
If you loved Fallout 3, New Vegas and 4, then you'll probably at least like 76. I think the bug talk is somewhat overblown - Yes, it's a major issue for some people, whereas for others, you're not going to run into anything more than an annoyance. It's impossible to know if you're going to be camp A or camp B until you play it. And, since the game is now available for $10 to $20, depending on how you buy it, it's a pretty low-cost proposition.
---
I’m all-in in the New Vegas Riot Gear, but I heard that Bethesda has some weird negativity about Obsidian that keeps FNV items out of FO76.
---
imo the only thing needing to be changed is stability and fixing the SH crashes.  more stability will __always__ be welcome, and SH crashing should be fixed.
---
the rewards imo are fine.  you can craft a standard armor every day and a PA piece every 3 days.
---
the PA is great and is the only PA we have with any type of offensive stat.  as far as standard armor goes solar is extremely strong, i rarely need to use stims on queens, silos, and in the raid itself.(ive had many 0 stim queen and silos, and a few 0 stim raids)
---
all 4 members of one of my teams are all food builds, we beat all missions in novi, standard, and expert.  its not at all about builds its all about learning the rooms, or at least learning a simple route to run for each player.  as food builds, the only person on our crew that runs a deficit is the person trying to feed a M2.
---
You're saying the difficulty doesn't match the rewards and that meltdown is tedious and should be removed, if that isnt implying it should be easier or the difficulty removed idk what is. The rewards, imo, do not suck. What you're saying is completely subjective. Guaranteed 3 star legendaries, plenty of aid items and ammo scrap, and exclusive raid armor is plenty great rewards if you ask me. I dont think they should shower us in rewards, because like you said, even on expert they aren't that difficult with a team and a little coordination.
---
Coward?  You mean opportunist.
---
I'm level 30.
---
I can see it now. The year is 2077, Fallout 12 just released. You put it in, screen prompt says "press A to start... and unlock everything." Sooooo much fun!
---
And it provides more than 20$ content
---
I have a level 31 alt I've been leveling. I dont get to play all that much during the week but in weekends I'm on
---
I'd like actual pets, not ones that disappear. Dogmeat! If I was a survivor I'd definitely befriend dogs/cats. I'd probably be the crazy animal lady. And every couple of days we have to feed them some cooked meat. One could follow or they'd stay at camp. I see so many imaginative camps, all that's missing is the dog sleeping on the front porch. 
---
From the dogs on FO4 we know they have the art assets. Unfortunately the pitbull has cropped ears.
---
No benefit, no damage to enemies. Just mans best friend accompanying you through the wasteland. And loot could be Dogmeat's armor, bandanas, goggles, stuff like that. Holiday bandanas, decorations for the dog house.
---
I know it's not on everyone's radar but it's not realistic for my char to not have a dog ( or 6 ) 😄
---
Hey Valseek,
---
We want more content and utility for the Syringer.  This weapon has serious untapped potential.
---
Added interactions for the Vox is perfect for world building, but the team shouldn't stop there.
---
It needs more options for applying buffs, debuffs, healing and damage. How about apply a Disease?
---
The radscorpion barrel stops being effective the moment you leave the forest. Increasing the duration of the effect will move it into a better spot.
---
The Syringer is your tool to begin fleshing out the poison damage type. Let's use it.
---
It's like that because you don't have to keep putting the disc in and out and you can download it on any PlayStation as long as you have your account on there.
---
That would be super
---
It would certainly be worth my atoms!
---
Also, if you're inside a workshop green zone anyone can initiate PvP with you by starting a claim there, so if you want to avoid PvP stay outside workshop boundaries.
---
Press button(s) to scroll up/down 5/10 entries, hold to scroll pages. Option to sort to Z/A. This would be great for (Known) Plan: ... too! Two birds, one Vault-Tec solution. ;)
---
I've been working on making serums to sell, farming legendaries and stacking 556 ammo.
---
This week I started the raids solo on novice. Getting them figured outside been fun.
---
I always check the vendors just to see if anyone sold legendary items. I found a 3* bloodied plasma pistol at the WS station last week for like 300 caps.
---
I don’t see why you would have that for a melee build, you would have to have perk cards for both melee and the laser related weapon.
---
lol I hope you realize the Fallout series is mocking this type of thinking
---
Bethesda could separate the designations into 2 indicators, clothing and armor.
---
But I think the real problem is people telling other people how to play their game.
---
If you dont have the caps to fast travel, then stop shopping and go make some caps
---
I play every night and I have to say that with the 3* gear it eats up.most of the scrips and you are stuck with selling 3 of them. I tried to scrip items after buying the 50% off legendary gear. I got more gear than I would be able to scrip in a week time.
---
Been awhile but I used to see them frequently at West-Tek
---
Mine won’t even leave my house LOL.
---
Nah, if that was the case I would be upset that even though it says Character Challenge \*which should mean for just that 1 character\* its actually account wide. lol
---
Ok, so not actually blunderbusses then. The blunderbuss is basically the shotgun equivalent for the black powder weapons and doesn't drop as a legendary. You're referring to the black powder rifle and pistol.
---
"Literally nothing bad is gonna come from a 5 minute conversation," spoken like a true extrovert lol. For us introverts sometimes the five minute conversation is the something bad, either that or the anxiety it causes. ;)
---
i can confirm this guy gets it
---
max caps get reached pretty fast
---
I'm a lvl 85, and my wife is in the 60's. I'm more than willing to help. Even if you don't want me to run missions, I'd be more than happy to craft weapons and armor for free if you provide materials. I don't always use my mic though. I have all the marine armor plans, under armor, most machined guns, and another character with melee weapons.
---
Their aren’t any energy related perks besides science
---
No...they are all gonna come back in like a month
---
I want all the Honest Hearts outfits. 🙂
---
Retexture them if you want (like you did with Grognak/Wildman), jus' gimmeh my Tribal stuff.
---
The digital download PC is, I found by picking the PS4, then changing edition to PC it was 16.
---
Thanks for a response. will do!!
---
I would literally just sit outside my camp and anytime someone would come by I'd shout "MAKE LIKE A TREE AND CLEAVE!"
---
They can spawn legendary just like (almost) any other mob.  Not common, but they do pop up every so often.
---
Every 3* I kill only has a 1* weapon anyway.
---
You can use your camera to find dead legendaries. Explosive weapons like to throw then distance sometimes. just scan the area with a camera, if its still in the world.
---
Cool! Ill pm ya!
---
Bloodied seems popular if you like being near death but punching the SBQ so hard she lands two states away.
---
Heard auto rifle is good
---
PA and heavy gun with melee back up works decent and what I use.
---
I tried sniper and explosives expert types but both can be a bit tough.  Sniper runs out of ammo if not built to comp...explosives just seem to be blah at times.  Funny but not impressive damage.  Especially the nukacola quantum grenade which makes the bad guy appear to just have bad gas.
---
Excluding the legacy explosive variant, they are pretty meh for pve.
---
The purveyor gifted me a bloodied ffr +1 perception laser. I put the beam splitter and gamma on it and it is just flat out bad in pve. This same weapon however seems really good in pvp, except if my opponent is too close it causes my client to freeze just like strangler armor. If they could fix that I imagine it would be my #1 weapon on that particular character.
---
I also play on ps4 (slim) and I don't have wired connexion, and I never get disconnects, I play 5 hours straight and nothing.
---
Idk how to help you maybe try with connect and reconnect the wire.
---
I want a variety of dog breeds to have as companions or at least pets.
---
And a big bushy long beard and a kilt so I can be a deranged Scotsman.
---
Im actually very introverted in real life, but when it comes to a video game with people who arent actually there I realize that no harm can be done through a TV screen. Unlike in real life, if a conversation gets awkward in-game all you have to do it press a button and leave the situation.
---
They Pushed Back Wastelanders for very Good Reasons. They said they dont want to Rush Things again and im more than happy when Wastelanders comes out good.
---
They may also be in a vault raid
---
Is auto rifle a stealth build ?
---
Jow does your build work? Would i just focus on melee while leveling ?
---
When a sale is supposed to run until the 21st, I expect to be able to cash in on that day. I had 400+ scrip still I was gonna burn last minute because I knew id be overweight and outta stash room. Angry but lesson learned.
---
Make a new character and do it all again!
---
The end game is to grind. A lot of people don't like grinding, but a lot of us strange folk really enjoy it. Grind for resources. Grind for legendaries. Grind for caps. Grind to keep your stash underweight!
---
Some people are far too squishy for that
---
I got one just yesterday outside West Tek.
---
I wasn't trying to call you out like a dick or anything, I've seen a bunch of people describing it this way and I guess Bethesda doesn't help when their marketing team releases statements like this:
---
"Wastelanders is turning out to be one of the largest expansions we’ve ever done, and it changes the entire world with human NPCs returning."
---
They overhype things a lot. It's pretty common for any business, but in the case of Fallout 76, it can be detrimental given how far the standard they set is from what they actually produce. So I guess I answered my own question as far as 'where this all comes from'.
---
As far as performance, I think the game has improved but it can still be terrible. I had awful slideshow lag clearing out Flatwoods and doing the initial Responders quests last week, when I tried to play a new character. It almost made me uninstall because it felt like nothing had changed, but once I got out of there things got better. xD
---
I would like my character to have 200 next to the name so if it's just to grind then grind I shall
---
They should add some Atom Shop cheatcodes for Nuka Tapper and Pipfall etc so we can Pay to Win
---
Ha, then it could be any of the three things suggested so far. :) Can you ask the player what they're up to via a messenger? Some of the vault raids, I don't think you can join if you're a lower level player, and there are also areas of the map that feature faction events.
---
Acid. I need my Camp node for that dearly, everything else I can find in abundance easy. There's a handful scattered around the map. I'm currently at the flower SE of TotW, wee pond, cave and a boat. Lots of vending traffic and cheap travel for all areas. It is very popular though. There's one near Arktos for lower levels too. ;)
---
Yeah, they are normal.  I found a few at West Tek.  
---
They are definately more uncommon than other muties, but they do exist.
---
U had us in the first half
---
Lol I actually thought it was hilarious.
---
Smh there is nothing pay2win in the atom shop. You want to see pay2win go pay x amount of rl $$ to borderlands 3 and you will be given a gernade that gives you endless in game currancy. Plus as bethesda has already said they will only sell things that make them endless money so the game can be supported. Hence utillity items are there cash cow atm.
---
I am quite literally asking to buff the rewards to match the difficulty **not to lower the difficulty** to match the rewards. There is a big difference from what you're saying I'm saying and what I'm actually saying. Also only 1 of the 3 raids has a guaranteed 3 star...
---
yes.
---
My advice, dont listen to the naysayers, they are the very small minority.
---
There have been posts about this for like 3 months and afaik BGS hasn't even mentioned anything about cheating on pc. Hope they do something for you masterracers but I wouldn't hold your breath
---
Hi,  
---
I will wait for Bethesda to release Information on "how" this Privat Server is Priced, what you can do etc. Personally I dont have an issue with paying for a Server for me and my Friends when:  
---
\-&gt; It's not Overpriced and has a Reasonable Price (Let's say 9,99 per Month for a 12 Slot Server)  
---
\-&gt; It's easy to Administrate and Configure  
---
\-&gt; Its reliable  
---
I do understand however that many want an "Offline" Edition or Dedicated Servers. A Separate Offline Mode (with an extra Character) would be cool and I hope with Mod Release Bethesda does that Option. For a Dedicated Server, I dont think that would be great, just because of the Massive Ressources it would need (which would be easily pricier than per month then lets say 9,99
---
This effect stacks for each hit. Assuming the target has a Poison Resist of 0:
---
A shotgun has 7 pellets per shot, if each pellet hits, this becomes 28 damage per second. An explosive shotgun has 7 pellets which explode for an additional hit. This becomes 56 damage per second from only one shot.
---
The higher your hits per second, the higher your poison damage.
---
Unfortunately, the visual effects are displayed for each hit. This stacks dozens or hundreds of the same visual effect on a target, lagging the game for everyone nearby.
---
Just south of silo alpha. It was centered right on me.
---
i just re-downloaded the game last night, i should be on later tonight, never got too far my first go around so ill be figuring everything out too    psn: johnny2-step
---
Most of my friends have the key so if you're on Xbox One and want a copy they can let you in to go get one. A lot better than paying somebody for it
---
Working on it and delaying it after the wasteland update last I heard.
---
Just bought a friend the game at retail on the Bethesda website. Greeeeat.
---
I've been playing this game since April and have only run across maybe a dozen people actively using a mic even when they're showing a mic icon.
---
I though it was pretty obvious that was a joke
---
thats really cool!
---
I guess some men just want to watch the world burn. Lol
---
its on pc :)
---
Ahh ok thanks. Ill try that
---
What damage number did you output?
---
I’ll be lurking this thread don’t mind me.
---
I need a team to do them and I want to learn them. Only reasons I want to do them is the PA and materials.
---
Man...this got weird fast
---
*leaves world*
---
Looks cool dude !! The free states character reminds me of Sarah Connor.
---
You can’t spam stimpacks in NW FYI. If you get shot while stimming it stops working.
---
They use standard pistol/rifle perks depending on how you've modded the stock. After they were buffed and armor-piercing was fixed, they're not *bad* but still fall behind other weapons in their class, especially for durability.
---
My advice if you're using one, avoid the sniper barrels and be aware that the Beam Splitter makes it degrade a whole lot faster.
---
There you go. A plan, a goal! That's all you need. 
---
Seriously though there is lots of fun to be had just exploring. Revisit areas that the storyline took you to, or visit areas that it didn't. Walk the map on foot without fast traveling. Run the silos back to back to back. Move your camp and rebuild it.
---
Go full taboo and get into pvp.....
---
It's more like they have to as why would we want to use servers this badly maintained overall? PC has always gotten bug fixes before consoles but man, if it has the word Beta in it, it seems to just be horribly managed. Probs why Survival got closed.
---
Yeah, a very nice couple of gents! 
---
They can certainly hold their own in the wastes as well. We always surprise each other with legendaries, apparel, and whatever we can think of. We got a pretty good thing going!
---
People who fill their vendors with 5k plus rounds of .38 ammo, common clothing, 40 cap stims, and pipe pistols get their doors left open and a “you have been insulted note” left at their camp
---
You betcha! Someone on the facebook group might be trading me for some fixer plans tonight, so hopefully I will be able to craft those soon too. Not going to hold my breath on it since I've been let down too many times, but we'll see.
---
I think I have a perfect faction pvp idea. You choose a faction and receive gear related to that faction. All factions have a goal that earns then loot. Weaker factions have easier goals but will be killed much easier. The goal is to complete your objective first. A few examples would be: The responders have to kill 100 scorched and make a cure. The bos have to kill 12 scorchbeasts and defend a base. The enclave would have to destroy the bos base and and rebuild liberty prime Etc.
---
Sounds like you attacked before even knowing if they were gonna kill you, unless you left a detail out. I had 2 players come there once too, but it turned out they just jumped in for the "defend x workshop" event icon that pops up on the map.
---
Same! They made us all Scouts for ~~Christs~~ Atoms sake.
---
That's wild, I've been playing since beta and have never seen one until today. Do they still do the legendary health bar refill, and do they actually drop legendaries?
---
Lol then I hit the bullseye, that's exactly the kind of vibe I tried to achieve, and that character's nickname is Sarah ahah
---
It's just something about the explosions in this game. It's so satisfying blowing up every car in whitespring with a single shot.
---
I'll do everything apart from pvp, every single person I've come across helped me or emoted and that was it, I'm not going to be the one to get people riled up
---
Yes, seen them multiple times.
---
Yes for wear, want it to be my primary outfit. I'll keep an eye out for the jumpsuit too!
---
Home Tattoo Kit ;)

---
We play it and prove how much we enjoy the game. We deserve something for our hard work.
---
In addition to the legendary effect, it can access 3 ammo types:
---
- .45
---
- .38
---
- .44 Ultracite
---
Most other weapons are limited to 2.
---
These 3 can all be reduced to 0 weight with Bandolier 2, making this weapon extremely user friendly.
---
That makes sense, and I can see some reasons for the servers not reloading. I wonder if the paid server launch has anything to do with it 🤔
---
Nice spreadsheet! I never know when I get an outfit if it's rare or not...
---
Ok so if we both agree they're not difficult then what rewards are there to buff? Guarantee 3 stars on meltdown and washout? What would you suggest they add to buff the rewards if they're so lackluster already?
---
All commando and tanky perks + frog legs for the win 🤷‍♂️ get a laser rifle with energy bobble head and it’s easy game!
---
Edit: or my personal favourite weapon.. auto laser pistol! Which unless I’m corrected doesn’t even get buffed by commando and it still shreds!!
---
Yes they do.  I pulled a bloodied switchblade off of the one I dropped yesterday.
---
Screenshot it and compare before you log off. Magical. ;)
---
CAMP Items: Give me a clean bathroom set! Non-busted toilet, clean tub (a clawfoot options??? :O), and a sink...even a non-functional one! And some different skins for my decontam arch, it's so awkward....I want a real decontam shower dammit! And there are tons and tons of cute assets already in-game that I would love to buy (variants of a fireplace, neat shelving, paintings, etc.)
---
Style: HAIR. Give me hair styles! I'd also pay for more premium hair colors...I've made posts in the past, but a pack of ombre options or some more sophisticated highlights...give me hair!!
---
Clothing: GLASSES. Sell. Me. Some. Glasses. There were cute ones with the poodle skirt I wish I had gotten, but I'd love more. Ones that look unique/unlike the ones in-game. Plus I need them to be Atom shop so I can have them in Nuclear Winter...my character looks so weird without her glasses when she spawns in, would definitely not advise anyone to join a death match BLIND.
---
Lololol. Magical my ass.
---
Yeah join us tonight!  Add me too Coogr77
---
The quest An Ounce of Prevention grants a hidden perk that reduces incoming damage from a SB sonic attack.
---
Ah darn, sorry then. It wasn’t you guys I saw. Glad to try to help though :)
---
If it's the one that drops from Forbidden Knowledge, not really. I've received a dozen of them as rewards personally.
---
Exactly this, since the sale was ending I rolled the dice on a number of characters and have 8-10 scrippable items on 3 different toons and just a handful of keepers between them.
---
Dont stop being kind tho my friend. The wasteland is mean enough.
---
I just wish you could leave the game in your terminal so that every time you get on it has the game already available. (Also beat the hell outta grognack it was the shizz)
---
I know what you mean, there's another thread up going on about having to scroll through all your vendor stuff before seeing your actual stashed items. Very annoying too!
---
Scorched terrorists?
---
Ok I'm so sorry for the bad joke but it was easy. Also what a weird scorched dude.
---
&gt; They decided instead of forcing it out and hiding its issues to better time it for optimal profits, they decided to hold off and sacrifice countless dollars in order to make sure the release is fun and enjoyable and THAT is reminiscent of the Bethesda I remember from the old days. 
---
With all due respect to you and to the class of people I will be referring to, you sound like someone who is suffering from battered wife syndrome. It's like you're trying to only see the positive or hoping that things will be better like they use to be while overlooking the facts as they present themselves.
---
Based on their track record of late Bethesda (and specifically BGS Austin) are horrible at time management. All companies experience delays some time or another. Few can boast the number of delays that Bethesda has had over the past year. Things are so bad that they've delivered slightly over half of the full 2019 roadmap that they said they would.
---
They're also devs who clearly prefer quick and hacky solutions and have no problem releasing thing that are not properly tested.
---
I would absolutely agree with you OP 100% if one additional thing happened - they fired the upper management of BGS Austin and replaced them with someone more experienced and more competent, whether it's someone external or BGS Maryland decided to take over management.
---
If BGS Austin's senior management hasn't changed, I honestly don't believe anything will change. 
---
You're right, it's better that it was delayed than releasing it this year as planned but I feel that it's less about the difference of doing it right than if they released it now, it'd be the death of the game and maybe even of BGS Austin as well. 
---
I really see the delay mostly as a self-preservation move.
---
I laughed when about 20 minutes after the challenges changed yesterday, I got a notification for swarm of suitors.
---
I kinda feel ATOMs are easy to earn, ive never bought any and still have been able to get everything i want, i jsut wait for sales
---
of course, i dont want any @#$@#% $17 (1700 ATOM points) skins, if i did, i would agree there is no way to get that many atoms unless you save up for a long time
---
I wouldn't recommend it currently, but it's making progress towards being a pretty good game, but I just feel like there are too many inconsistent and downright buggy elements currently to whole-heartedly recommend it.
---
I usually shoot one car a few times, then shoot the rest just once so that it starts a slow chain reaction rather than one huge explosion. I think it's the noise and rumble of the explosions.
---
What are the damage range of junkies
---
Is this what yall do with your time. Find reasons to complain. Like serously if i and hundreds of other players who actualy play and are still enjoying our time. Why cant you? Yall have issues well then easy answer find some other game to play forget 76 exists Non of us will miss you because all you do is whine and complain. This truth will hurt but its fact.  Have fun down voting you cry babies.
---
I love it! That white flash is just super cool and then there's that moment of wonder, at White Springs in particular, if some poor unsuspecting player just spawned into chaos at the wrong time and got blown up.
---
Ok thanks everyone. That'll teach me to try and drop in unexpectedly.
---
Sounds like ur telling me how to play my game.....
---
If it hasn't shipped yet, you might be able to cancel
---
That's why I kept a 2 shot Western revolver, takes care out in one squeeze of the trigger!
---
I think it was around 150. Which doesn't make much sense to me. It was a headshot (I got darker yellow numbers instead of light yellow). Just played another game, found a scoped lever-action, and put a guy down in one shot to the head from full health. I know the Hunting Rifle does a bit less damage, but still...
---
*3A-0.12. -FO76 isn't P2W  
---
*4A-2.22. -Bethesda therefore can't double down on it  
---
*6B-2.22.2 -Your list of 10 things has 12 points.
---
Is this a Green Eggs &amp; Ham question? Is a response in trochaic tetrameter required?
---
exactly.  we're cool with trying games as a service, but give us some damn service!
---
Taking the ammo factory = guaranteed PvP. Live and learn!
---
It was digital and assigned to an account ;(
---
That actually makes sense and we could slowly get what we need. Silver and gold is used at times but not that often. I feel they need to balance out the game more but it could have issues with server stability that everyone discusses about. We need this compromise at times.
---
For starters complete removal of the legendary module mechanic that makes things more grindy or at least reducing its cost in half. Flat out doubling or tripling the expert mode (and only the expert mode's) vault steel. Adding good drop chances for rare/rarer plans then currently for players who've already gotten all the plans for all the armor sets (things like deathclaw gauntlet plans or even the illustrious plasma grenade plan these can be still be rare). Allowing players to get three rewards daily from any difficulty instead of 1 from each difficulty (IE being able get rewards from expert mode 3 times a day but losing the ability to get rewards from standard and novice). Finally if players are going to craft legendary items they should be able to pick at least 1 of the prefixes they're crafting. That'll reduce the chances of them getting a roll they dislike significantly reducing their negative feelings from getting a roll they don't want and if there will eventually be 4-5 star armor pieces in the future it won't even matter that much.
---
All or any of these things are possible and would be great incentives to get players to complete the vault raids.
---
Edit: Also being able to scrap unwanted vault rolls from the raid would be a nice return on investment.
---
Lol, pretty much!!!
---
Well if bethesda blocked low lvls from entering mid and high lvl areas maybe you wouldent be seeing low lvl crap in high lvl areas. Bethesda screwed up when they made it to were enemies scale down if there is a low lvl in that zone. Were going to be further screwed once the new event system drops allowing anyone who shows to collect all rewards. Sees alot of extreamly low lvls showing up to queen from now on witch will drop the lvl of rewards we get.
---
i’m starting to feel like i’m the only person who’s never DCed
---
It limits us so much and gives us no reason to scavenge when we can't collect that much.
---
Unless something is going down at Spectrum that they haven't made me aware of, no. That and I'm not having trouble with anything else.
---
They're sadly too focused on the atomic shop and selling us private servers to make the base game better until 2020, I like your way of thinking though, I do wish there was some way for us high levels to have a challenge.
---
Nope, my tip for getting plans...
---
GET OUT THERE, EXPLORE APPALACHIA! Really exploring always rewards on a Bethesda fallout.
---
I have 2 points in each of the gladiator perks,  maxed on the armor piercing perk, 2 points in swing speed.  Maxed on all the rifleman perks, 1 point in concentrated fire, and max in tank killer. 3 points in fireproof, 3 in bloody mess, all the sneak perks.
---
Pretty versatile build!
---
I've done everything. I even switched it over to wireless. It was slightly better for about an hour, but then it went back to disconnecting.
---
Since I got dense mods on my chest pieces I love to jump up on top of a car and smack it with a meat hook, kaboom, I'm ok and laughing my head off. I put dense on a low level alts's armor. I think I confused people when my level 5 character could survive a close quarters carsplosion. Plus I have 2 pieces of fall damage armor so I'm always jumping off cliff camps and laughing at my crazy unharmed drops.
---
Did u save any level points?
---
We see vault dwellers from both 96 and 63 dead on the map so those vaults have been opened
---
Unfortunately no. All ballistic.
---
I found them Southwest of Harper's Ferry where the road meets the tracks.
---
Aww man that's a drag... I don't know maybe contact user support on Bethesda.net maybe they'll do something, check the frequent questions part. Hope you get this fixed friend.
---
Yeah, the pushing back of wastelanders was definitely a disappointment, but hey, if they wanna make it good I suppose they should take the time!
---
And thanks! Yeah, I try to make the game look fun, because it genuinely is! And hey... sometimes mocking the game adds some good entertainment, haha
---
I'm still having introverted trouble using my mic. Partially because I'm female and have had shit in the past. 
---
Tried NW for the first time last night and stayed silent as dudes on my team chatted away about hackers slowing down their game. 
---
It was an interesting experience, but kinda sucked because a hacker just swooped in one shotting everyone.
---
Someday I'll find the courage to talk to people, but it was fortunate no-one could hear my frustration. 
---
Glad to hear I'm not alone in this mute awkwardness and happy you had the support to speak up, even if the guy fucked you over in the end.
---
Have you not heard of nuka crypt? The nuke codes are decrypted extremely fast and posted up there
---
that's brilliant! lol
---
I have 8
---
Im with you. Raider stuff is ugly imo.
---
SUPER SLEDGE!!!
---
Same. I started when the PVP was a lot more open. Players could murder you if they were op enough, griefers destroyed your base all the time, workshops were a deathtrap. Not to mention that time I got scammed out of a furious explosive harpoon gun...
---
I guess you could say we grew up in bad neighborhood. Lol
---
It's gotten relaxed as patches keep rollin out, so I guess I was kinda caught off-guard. Lol
---
Doing events and taking workshops also give plans. Sometimes you can find plans for cheap from player vendors. They take up inventory space, so sometimes people will drop the prices really low just to get rid of them.
---
That sale was awesome but in the end you can't get rid of that stuff so easily with the limit.
---
OH YEA!! Its so odd those arent in game!!
---
In case you didn't see it the recent in the vault has a challenges rework mentioned in it
---
I like the plasma, I havent messed with laser weapons. I have an unarmed main character and use a Hunters Handmade for when I am lazily killing trash mobs or Scorchbeasts. I have 7 Perception with rank 3 Tank Killer and 1 each Commando perks and it works great
---
Yes plz!! I already have the rank of General! I should be able to look the part!
---
:( *sadness intensifies*
---
Never can go wrong with mans best friend. Selling Fog meat skins would be amazing!
---
Right. Gold and silver scrap could be a better currency than 556 ammo or legendaries.  It also could have an in game set value determined by the robot vendors. 10 gold scrap is worth 100 caps.....this allows exchange of items between players for way more currency than you currently can carry in caps. 
---
This would allow caps to still retain value but also allow players to carry more currency for high ticket items. Win win!
---
Someone give this man a medal!
---
Definitely not. The skeletons and car accidents would indicate that the people died instantly in a blast wave, but there were no bombs dropped in Appalachia (otherwise we'd have a massive radioactive area like the Glow (Fallout 1) or the Glowing Sea (Fallout 4). No bombs = no blast wave, so what killed them instantly?
---
Oh friend don't think like that :) I stay positive to this situation, if more players start demanding this system Bethesda will do something. 
---
We both know that they're still Bethesda the team that brought us great games and wants us to be happy, this is just a confusing era for Bethesda. Call it "company puberty" if you want 😂.
---
Have a good one folk.
---
That last bit was so funny but I really relate to the whole mic anxiety thing and Fallout 76 helped me come out of my shell for that as well. I’ve been playing games for years but never used a mic on one because I’m too anxious to speak to a real person but so many people in FO76 have been like you and tried to help me since I’m low level. One person helped me out and wanted me to join a group with him and his friend, he asked if I had a mic and after a lot of deliberating I plugged in a pair of earbuds and just started talking. He ended up being really nice and we played FO together a few other times and I even got some proper headphones to talk through- it was really confidence boosting!
---
I don’t engage in PvP very often, so it’s not a huge priority for me.
---
I know it. I enjoy helping out the little guy and paying forward the kindness of the occasional do-gooder from my low-level days.
---
People need pet in their lives. Thats just how it is.
---
No, Grahm is selling us stuff all the time.
---
This man gets it ^
---
Remove the splitter and put on a beam focus. Also Full auto and you got a good weapon. Been running like this for many many lvls now.
---
Queen its no good. She has a super high energy resistance. But its a burst away from kill8ng aything else.
---
Same, you are not alone.
---
I wouldn't, it'll be decent at most during the main quest, after that the "end game" is really just farming for legendary items. It's a tiny bit better bug/glitch wise than it was at launch. But as it currently stands I probably wouldn't recommend it until 2020 when more content comes because it's really dry atm. But if you just want to screw around and don't care about the end game and just explore then sure, you might enjoy it for a bit. You'll really like it if you just wanna play dress up or customize your camp though, atomic shop updated every week.
---
You have to use them so you have the the points you earned at lvl 30
---
You can't save perk points like that. When you level up, it'll only show the available perks for whatever level you started banking perks.
---
The chance to find plans in containers is completely rng. There are several world spawn plans around as well but what those plans are is also rng. World spawn items will also spawn for the first person to load into an area for a while. That means that if someone came through just before you and grabbed those plans or had grabbed them in the previous 20 hours then they won't spawn. It also means that you can farm them if you have a friend that can load into an area first and then let you run through and grab all the plans in the area. After that you can switch servers and do it again. The same trick works for any world spawn items so you can use it to farm resources that you need
---
The damage cap is the main reason me, my wife and friends stopped playing. We never played on Adventure. Always on survival because it felt like Fallout really should and it was fun when we had chances against other players who just ran straight into our double barreled shotguns because it was all we had in the beginning. Now being miles away from decent gear I find no joy in playing a game where literally everyone can bully me or torture to death with melee weapons while all I can do is watch. We couldn't even kill an AFK friend who had autostim gear.
---
Telling me to go and grind on adventure isn't an option. We wanted survival and we're still waiting until it returns.
---
As I stated before, his most recent source was over 10 years ago. The others were close to 30 years old. If you're working off very old sources for something in recent time to prove your case, it really doesn't hold much merit.
---
If the sources were from a couple of years ago, I'd actually give it some merit.
---
Also, like I also said, I checked on his background. He doesn't even have a background that warrants merit - under 2 years experience as a uni student in finance. That's the best he's got. If he was a stockbroker that's worked in the industry for 10+ years, once again, I'd give it some thought but EVEN THEN, if that mythical person based all their sources from 10-30 years ago, I would likewise question that.
---
I'm not dismissing this person out of hand for no good reason or that I dislike him. Didn't even know who he was until you gave me that link.
---
Look at the situation on the face of it. An inexperienced student whose only work background is selling home theatre gear and youtube bases their theory on "evidence" (I use that term VERY lightly) from 10-30 years ago to predict something in the future, the kindest thing you could say is that they have a very weak basis for their case.
---
Do you see my point?
---
I actually don't care if Bethesda is going public or not, nor did I even know this guy beforehand. I have absolutely no dog in the fight. I'm just basing my view on the evidence as it presents itself.
---
This has been suggested so many times I'm amazed they haven't done it.   
---
I used to run an arcade, so it's possible to do it even now, you just have to load the tape manually each time.
---
Some of it looks nice but for fuck sake pick another faction lol responders just have one PA skin, and three weapon skins for weapons not many people will use in a build. Brotherhood and enclave have nothing,  
---
Where are the camp items? Where are the cool looking armor skins and clothing? Weapons skins? Venders skins? Backpacks? Like the fuck lol
---
I have a screen Cap of the same thing. I'm on xbox or I'd post it (haven't figured that out yet). I could have sworn I heard Sarah MacLaughlin in the breeze...
---
I really hope you're right, been positive about it since beta but it's getting super hard to keep feeling that way. 😴 Hopefully they buckle down and get everything fixed, you have a good one also.
---
Cue Sarah MacLaughlin music...
---
I have a blast with the stealth auto rifle build.  If you stay in hidden or caution you get at least 2x bonus damage that you can increase with perk cards.  I did semi auto stealth while leveling because it was what I normally play.   I moved to auto rifles after level 100 for something different and actually enjoy it as much if not more.  As for builds, go with what fits your play style and you enjoy doing.  Both rifles and melee are very powerful in the game.  The site below will let you see all the perk cards and play around with your build.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Or summon liberty prime.
---
Havent seen people say the PvP is integral. Tho it is a part of the game and something Bethesda obviously wants to be in the game, no matter how other people try to spin it.
---
Thing is in FO3 - FO76 (and frankly the first two, as well) you've been able to wander freely, and the only gate keeping was running into high level enemies. Remember the quarry in New Vegas? Yeah you don't want to wander in there after Victor gets you out.
---
This is still true for characters fresh out of the vault. Your free to go where you want if'n your willing to risk dying quickly and frequently.
---
The main difference is, we don't have a difficulty setting in the menus. We can't opt in to higher difficulty without intentionally nerfing our characters by perk/equipment choices.
---
Opposite problem here.  I activate all 3 pylons in the event, then run into the shack, deploy a suit of PA in the doorway and stimpak myself.  She’s down in about a minute.
---
The problem is that there’s always that one level 41 without a mic getting ahead of me and activating one of them.  By the time he’s down she’s on top of me before I can re-activate it and get clear.
---
Had this exact scenario last night and every time I respawned same player got to a pylon.  Finally walked away after respawning 8 times.
---
In the arms of an angel....
---
Yes it's fine. 
---
War... war never changes.
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
two weeklong holiday events (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but it's coming out early next year
---
You let your dog roam the neighborhood, don't you?
---
(Please understand this a joke)
---
Strength and luck have all the heavy perks
---
I can dig it. That sounds quite effective, I’ll probably look to set my build up this way 🙂
---
Puberty last 4 years minimum but the university of vault tec said "company puberty lasts until wastelanders comes out, and it ends with a, 69? N.I.C.E"
---
They're the experts, any questions to them.
---
Idk if its moral..but I mean this is a Fallout game, morals sometimes take a backseat and that's ok in a Fallout game.
---
It is a part of the game tho, and workshops are there to foster/promote PvP.
---
You can play the entire game with VERY little to no hindrance without claiming a workshop.
---
Killing someone and taking their workshop isnt griefing tho. That's something people need to understand. Ridiculous how often people through that word.
---
Not mine, belongs to the data miner., I just saved a link to it.
---
? pics of the calendar
---
Level 127 and done every quest....except launching a nuke. 😫
---
I don't think you can be banned for this if you only pick.
---
One week ago one level 630 came in my camp and made the mine exploit. I don't know why maybe you can destroy Camp by this way
---
Damn I don't know how many hours to reach 630 but It was very very surprising he risks to be banned for such stupid thing.
---
Sack hood + miner uniform/steel worker uniform = sack mask Jason Voorhees. The chainsaw is just more fun. Plus it's hard to come by s 2-3☆ Furious machete or pickaxe
---
Don't worry, I'm sure there will be an autoledger added to the atomic shop any day now.
---
😂 I just made the post for the laughs, but I'll be named Obama's boss if I got the date right.
---
sorry you assumed wrong buddy.  get em next time
---
Nicely done.
---
I had this happen the other day because I forgot. I was at 1040 atoms. The next day when I logged on I had 1100 and didn't complete any other challenges or weeklies so I dunno what's up with that

The scorched took out the free states survivors before they came over the mountain. The Morgantown airport attack that effectively ended the Responders happened about in 2096. Vault 76 opened in 2102, 6 years later.
---
Yeah nuka crypt is the point. People go there instead of trying to decipher the codes themselves mostly, because acquiring the codes is a pain.
---
I'm personally guilty of that.
---
Actually the way it works is based upon the average level of players in the area
---
I took a bunch of the perks in luck too. Getting those vats criticals is awesome!! Currently have a quad faster fire lever action that puts in work!! It is nice to pop on power armor and smack some ghouls at whitesprings though!! I took 3 ranks in glow sight and switch that in for a rifleman perks when I'm doing that. 1 shot all those glowing boogers! 💪💪
---
Im here. Handfull of ctd since starting just before wild Appalachia.
---
Its fun. Kind of. I get it its tedious when they ask for every gun they cant use yet and complain bc you only made the level 15 versions... I had one kid I made a full set of armor for and he wanted a pistol, well I am an avid appreciator for the pistol players as I am one myself so i obliged.  He began to go on about how hes just doing this until some battle royal game updated and i told him if he got me more adhesive I'd upgrade the gun I made for him. He traveled to his camp and came back promptly gave me the adhesive and asked again several more times for pistols I dont have the plans for I was crafting upgrades on the gun and server drop. I was rescued from my own kind deed. Saved by server instability.  It can be a pain, but imagine yourself younger than 14 and your new. How would you want your interaction with that level 100+ guy to go?
---
Is doing great friend :D 
---
If you want a big comeback, wastelanders comes on Q1 2020 more polished than never. And really look at that guys list it would come in handy if you really want to comeback now.
---
and farm recourse defend guests
---
But yet i cant count how manny lvl 5 toons i see daily running around white springs witch nerfs the lvl cap of the enemies and also nerfs the loot.
---
At least you have scrip to turn in?
---
OH
---
Right but the people who get those codes spend time getting them in the first place. The code word isn't available until late in the week anyway so most of that time you wouldn't be able to nuke
---
Bought it off the roaming responders vendor bot for 100 caps I believe. Might’ve been a bit more.
---
Jokes are obviously frowned upon on this subreddit 😴
---
Yeah wait a sec. I'm gonna do some changes to the post...
---
Yes!! There was one standing in my private room on the 2nd floor of my house... which is behind a password door. I was so confused and a bit scared if I’m being honest
---
I've had this happen near Welch as well, but after a little but I must have accidentally hit a super mutant because they turned on me lol.
---
That's true, hear this man out because he's spitting facts like a minigun.
---
For how long :0
---
Wish I could have paid 16$ for this game instead of 60, totally not worth 60 in my opinion. 😴
---
Wait is it permanent?
---
Being the negative person I am — I truly think Wastelanders is pushed back because they can’t get the instancing to work without raid-level bugs and crashes. The scope of wastelanders is too big for the game’s archaic servers, and they’re creating a ton of new bugs and issues just adding these assets to the game. (For some reason all the dlc assets load in after the base world loads; every new asset in the game slows it down even more). 
---
My theory: The instancing, new legendary perk and dialogue systems, and new npcs / assets are just too much for the game and servers to handle, the delay won’t change that, and wastelanders will come out either extremely buggy like the raids, or several features will be scrapped / reduced. Like the Anthem devs had to fight their own game engine and lost, Bethesda is sadly doing the same. 
---
But it’s their fault, refusing to upgrade their game engine for years and years...
---
I was confused about that lol. Thought I was doing the mission wrong.
---
I can get behind that.  I was actually disappointed with the Survival mode when it came out because I didn't really think it addressed the problems at the time.  It was my opinion that Survival mode just gave griefers a place to further congregate in what was ostensibly a better game mode otherwise.  As TSE dupping dwindled, griefers lost a little interest, and sore losers stopped complaining about PVP, I started enjoying it from time to time.  I probably spent about a third of my time in Survival mode, what little I played before quitting for a while.
---
Allow for tea breaks remember.
---
I paid full price for this at launch and put around 500 hours into it, I feel like I definitely got my money's worth.
---
Other than earning extra atoms, I like the account one thing, at least we can earn atoms on any character which is kinda cool.
---
In the same boat as you, nearing in on 600 hours. I don't feel like I got my money's worth, but that's just my opinion.
---
Well I'd offer my help, but ya'know...
---
I have already. Their support isn't exactly the greatest, they just generally send me automated responses and close out my ticket. Thank you for the well wishes, friend. Hope to see you in the wasteland sometime.
---
Why not just delete it then?
---
This is correct. A fixer has 20% more damage than an equivalent combat rifle due to the special mod on it
---
Ok the post is fixed take a look at the edit, I made it thinking about you ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)...
---
Ok no 😂 but you have a good point and I ad it just in case if Bethesda is looking.
---
Actually I have plenty of time on my hands, I  own several successful businesses, and various investments in the Tech sector. I am a master of time management, and life is a balancing act. 
---
 And it actually works out to be about 7hrs a day on average. I honestly was addicted to the game at one point,  so that be said, yes maybe it is a little too much.  
---
And it has been close to a  year,  if you include the beta. We are only 3 weeks away from a years. 
---
But all good things must come to a end, right. 
---
Nonetheless, to each there own. I hope you continue enjoying the game for decades to come. 
---
I wish you the best.
---
Acid, lead, and adhesive have been very successful for me. Also plastic but I usually hoard that for myself lol. 
---
I can sell the above consistently for 30-40 caps a piece.
---
Only you can answer that! ;) Just sell what you don't need now, you'll always get more! I always have loads of concrete I don't need, bulk and sell.
---
In order for the plan to drop you have to complete the lying Lowe questline
---
I'll be roaming on Ps4 servers.
---
PSN: Weezunder.
---
Still a rediculous grind
---
Xbox per chance?
---
Yeah I’m thinking concrete myself, don’t build much in my camp
---
Pickaxe would make sense for sackhead Jason.  That was his weapon in part 2.
---
Aluminium steel copper fert springs lead plastic oil cloth....
---
Most bulk sells if you discount it 60-85% depending on rarity.
---
Sounds good
---
Yeah I was thinking acid, I don’t think I use that too much
---
No ammo ever gets reduced to 0. It looks like that because the decimal places don't go far enough.
---
F@cking goofs on here hey! I could not agree with you more. 
---
same here on PC. after killing the queen the game legit shut itself down. back to desktop, frozen inputs, reset again.
---
That isn't supposed to happen, it should be max level if you are over level 50. The gear you get from the purveyor should be level 45 or 50
---
Cold.
---
What a t\*\*t
---
Not everyone enjoys a broken game. If you do, congratulations, very proud of you. But we're "complaining" because some of us dumped 60$ into the game and feel cheated. 😴 Things so simple as perk loadouts have been delayed until next year, something that modders quickly added within what? The first few weeks/month of the game's lifespan? Content has been dry for months and when all has failed they decided to just hop on the battle royale train which is full of hackers that they don't seem to do anything about, if you release a game and do dumb shit like this you're subject to criticism, it's nothing new.
---
Things will change depending on what you're doing. You selling to bots or in your vendor?
---
You are the type of person that ends up with a derogatory thing on their camp and then gets banned.
---
Understandable, hopefully when Wastelanders hits it'll make the game more worthwhile for you.
---
I'm not sure I understand. Are you asking about buying a PC copy to install on the PC? Why wouldn't you be able to redeem the code for PC?
---
I hope so too, I'll for sure revisit when it drops and try to enjoy it.
---
What a nice person to go to a party with...
---
I don’t have a disk drive on my PC would I asking if I’d be able to install through the code if I bought the physical copy somehow
---
I've done those enough that i don't get anything new from them anymore. They also don't seem to give any weapon/armor plans which is mainly what i want.
---
Are you agreeing with me? Or is there something wrong on my end?
---
This is incorrect. All the quest does is make you immune to getting the scorched plague
---
To vendors
---
*SO MUCH*
---
ps4? xbox? pc?
---
Xbox!
---
The physical copy I got from amazon was a code (on a fake cardboard disk).  Not even sure the last time I saw an actual disk, though I mostly get steam stuff these days.
---
From what I've read, the physical version just has a download link printed on a cardboard disc. Hopefully someone who's bought it can confirm.
---
All backpack skins work with the small backpack
---
Sounds like a glitch of some sort, the purveyor is supposed to give you items near your level. So if you are over 50, your gear from her should be max level. Haven't heard of anyone else having that issue so I don't have any suggestions to fix it sorry 😥
---
I won’t take a workshop from anyone 15 levels under me UNLESS it’s the ammo factory, that’s fair game
---
I blow shit up any chance I get 
---
Nuka mines and nuka grenades are a must have
---
Yup, when you shoot something and the shot doesn't register it's instant realization that the server is about to crash.  Also I've still never seen the flatwood monster, in fact I've not done a lot of stuff in that game yet. But it's kinda hard to when it constantly crashes, am I right?
---
When this happens get off that server. The servers encounter budget is too high and it'll move bodies and change them to meat piles in order to free up some
---
Neither do I as of right now. So I've just been selling as much as possible and hoarding caps lol lead also for people who make a lot of ammo. And speaking of ammo if you make 5.56, .44, and .308 they sell really well consistently as well for 1 cap a piece.
---
Got it, thanks bro! 👍🏻
---
I’m not really that bothered by it. What I got is still decent. Not as good as max level stuff, but I got a guitar sword I can actually use in power armor vs a death Tambo I can’t (for some reason)
---
If you're selling at your Camp you'll want certain things that people use, Screws, Acid etc (but you'll need them too).
---
-
---
If you're selling to Vendor Bots just Bulk whatever you've got loads of. Good rule of thumb, only keep junk in your stash 50, 100 or 200 of each, depending on what you use consistently. Bulk and sell the rest.
---
I have a bloodied FFR gamma gun in my wheel
---
Sammy started it . . .
---
For the sale prices you can find it at? Yes. For full price? No.
---
I'm on PS4!
---
Gotta make it worth it's weight like it used to be before the war. Maybe make it where you smelt it together to make it into bricks so you can sell it as bulk.
---
Scout masks don't drop from enclave events anymore. I can get most of the really rare chances in a bit
---
Ps4
---
Sheeeet
---
This would be awesome. 
---
So many times I have headed out there for the stack of plates and find nothing but baseballs laying around where there should be a mass of bowling pins.
---
I don't think you'll get banned
---
Boredom. Or may they don't come to this sub or the forums to see all the "I was banned for picking up a bag" type claims.
---
Too bad!
---
add me my psn is cortecca
---
Not anymore. The sheepsquatch makes you have 0 Dr and 0 er so only percentage based reductions will work
---
Bandolier 2 is well worth it 
---
I run with about 6k .556 ammo, 10k ultracite 44 ammo, and 10m ultracite .556 ammo.
---
I still don't know which pylon is which so by the time I get to the right one it's always already taken XD
---
It's a gun. Str does nothing for it...
---
Its all used though.
---
Gee- a crossbow- how generous.
---
Oh awesome thank you!!!!
---
In power armor you cant use unarmed weapons, like death tambo, meat hooks, boxing gloves, knuckles, etc.
---
Yeah! It's great fun, just a bit buggy.
---
Better than each and every one of the lad’s current weapons. A Crossbow. Which can rapid fire 4 shots, more than the 3 in NW. The only draaaw-back? You gotta load the arrows in individually as opposed to the Quad Harpoon Gun i just snagged which loads the 4 harpoons in with a single reload.
---
I really need to finish the quest or find someone that sells the backpack plan
---
The "fix" has been posted a gazillion times:
---
See the Curator 
---
Uncheck the quest in your PipBoy 
---
It's a repeatable daily quest. Changed your mind and want to do it again? Re-select the entry and go get the body.
---
That would be too easy. Instead, how about an option to make the plans of anything you know?
---
It ended at 4pm BST.
---
Yes, just preplanning for when they start selling, er spawning hockey mask
---
I still mean at random and that you would have to know the plans
---
This and a million other simple things have just been ignored for so long, i honestly think they have no idea how to fix the game that was built around a broken core. Not to mention there is just nothing new being added to keep players interested....By the time they fix it i will be playing something better....possibly The Outer Worlds or Cyberpunk 2077
---
Just hurry up and marry her.  That would solve the problem, wouldn't it?  Might as well get that first divorce over asap...
---
If I recall it's plus 10% damage per addiction up to 50%..
---
The "physical copy" is 100% a cardboard disk with a code. You'll be fine.
---
I WISH!
---
Yeah I know. I just think it’s odd. I don’t get why that line has been drawn.
---
Not a fan but I get why they did it. The backpack is a huge advantage and locked behind challenges that require some leveling and grinding.
---
A lot of their updates have been for the early game. They must have looked at the data and seen that a lot of people start the game and quit early on.
---
Yeah I’m aiming towards getting the ammosmith perk, making a crap tonne of ammo and then selling it off hopefully
---
Already have the game, just gonna wait until it becomes f2p so I can get my friends into the action.
---
Make it look like an old school general store ledger! A simple tally that tracks the last month of purchases. Orr you could put it in your camp terminal; add a little content into it.
---
Some of the stuff people place cannot be obtained anymore and your only choice to place them is when someone decided to put them somewhere. You face choice of free resources or new thing.
---
Of course there are cases when people strictly spam something. I didn't refer to these.
---
That’s what I dream of doing one day 😂
---
Have at least one person in each habitat. You're shooting for at least 2/3 in Venison (Yao Guai or Deathclaw is good), 3/3 in Radkelp (Mirelurk King really the only good one there) and *only* 2/3 in Toxic Sludge (Megasloth sucks, you don't want to have to protect a Megasloth). Toxic Sludge is the easiest one to hit, as it's gathered both from spawns and mole rat bodies (poor little mole ratties!) Radkelp and Venison are more reliant on spawns.  Try not to die, as this will really damper your ability to protect your friendly animals. Formula P is best, but Q does improve loot tables I'm pretty sure
---
Uncle Todd definitely does not approve this message. 
---
https://ibb.co/zH5Rkzx
---
They announced this week we're gonna get private servers so the game will soon be pretty different, with various PvP servers you'll get to oppose players the way you like (i.e. I plan to have non-legendary league as part of what'll happen on our servers), roleplayers will finally be able to make a serious stand in this game, factions controlling their own worlds will farm in peace or visit other faction servers, having full server participate in player-hosted events will become physically possible. This week is going to bring big changes.
---
I have that perk and honestly I have so much ammo I don't even know what to do with it otherwise hahaha plus I ended up going with a melee build so I don't use very much ammo if at all. I just sell it all
---
Ditto
---
It's over already. I missed today's sale because my machine refilled a few minutes after it ended...
---
On my first character I had the perk and just had a silly amount but that was when the game first came out
---
Congrats, hope you find a job soon.
---
I really wish I still retained this mindset of awe and wonder. It was like that a month in before I realized it wasn't too hard taking out anything at any amount. I even made a fully naked character wielding knuckles as my only weapon, relying only perks and consumables to boost up my attacks and defenses, just to try to get that adrenaline rush again.
---
Yes confirmed. Annoying to realise that after buying it following the free week. Saved 20$ getting the card disc though compared to buying the virtual version.
---
No, can't find any solution.
---
are you new, or like me, the game just stopped working.
---
Closing in on 800 hrs... Still no nuke launch. My guy is 187 i really got to get on this.
---
Even if we don't have them as permanent companions, but we have a charisma perk that works like the mysterious stranger perk but uses your pet instead.
---
I don't know if this is why, but I always thought that it was because those weapons had to fit over a human hand. So for instance, a boxing glove couldn't fit over a large power armor fist.   Just my theory lol.
---
&gt;We want to create an Atomic Shop experience where players feel good about spending their hard-earned Atoms. To make the system more fun and engaging for all players, we plan on reworking parts of the Challenge and reward system next year to be clearer, more fun, and more impactful for all types of players.
---
They said clearer, more fun and more impactful. Makes me feel like they mean it'll be easier and we'll get more atoms. But only Beth knows for sure.
---
That many disconnects is extremely unnormal. I will go 6 hours without a disconnect on Xbox. So I can only assume it’s your gear or your isp
---
Well we see bodies definitely fresher than 6 years even right outside the vault with responders outfits and orders. I mention the free states because they had some very solid resources and were pretty hardcore survivalists. It wouldn't be very surprising a small pocket was in a well hidden bunker. I also think there may be some still alive in that little train tunnel near Harper's ferry. It's fully boarded up. I think there might be some free states remnants, maybe ghoulified, in there. If any of the humans ghoulified they could have survived underground without food/water and we see radiation barrels outside. Also I think the free states are awesome and really want to see Harper's ferry returned to working order, so I might be biased.
---
Love this,  mine follow similar...
---
* my responder is more standard firebreather
---
* my enclave also brings prototype x01 and ultracite
---
* my free states wears thevcivil war dress with trapper chest
---
I WANT TO GO TO YOUR CAMP NOW!
---
It qualifies as a Dick pick.
---
I guess...
---
Man, I wasn't calling your life into question,  I was questioning what appeared to be addictive behavior...2000 hours of anything in one year is a sure way to burn out on that thing. A full work year is 2080 hours, in most cases between 60-100 hours of that time, in most places, is vacation time.  
---
All I'm trying to say is, take a break for a while. If you've invested 2K hours into a game, you have a love for it. Don't just throw that love away...
---
I’ve been playing with a more casually oriented buddy lately, and I think I know where every last radroach in the toxic valley lives now. LOL
---
I find it strange, a question asking about the morality of an action committed within a game simulating post apocalyptic America, where everyone fights tooth and nail over scant resources. If it were me I wouldn't be bothered by it; I'd kill the level 1 (or 2) coming out of the vault if it was possible.
---
He is in zero hurry to get married. Lol
---
2000 scrip.  Got one keeper. A 3* VE LMG
---
Of course that's what I did.  Point is - if you put down stuff on someone else's camp without asking - you're kind of a dick.
---
Alright I'll see you after work
---
You're the kind of person who puts derogatory things on someone's camp.
---
They've abandoned the just cosmetics in the Atom shop. Given that 95% of the camps I visit have scrap collectrons they should make a lot of money selling utility items
---
Whether reddit likes it or not utility items sell well.
---
More money = more resources for FO76. I think the game should start improving with the additional cash flow from these items.
---
I'm level 118 and still have difficulty on solo taking done certain enemies. I think it's my mindset of holding onto as much as I can between my meds and ammo. But when I'm playing with my friends who are all lower than me by at least half I tend to be the knight in shining armour.
---
This was my interpretation also and yet some people took away that they were nerfing atoms. I guess we read what we want to read lol
---
I can’t find the picture, but there was a leaked map that’s about 3x the size of our current one. Our current map is in the center of it with about 20% more on all sides.
---
If that’s being released with Wastelanders, I guess the delay makes more sense. Filling up that much space would require significant resources.
---
I’m low lvl (26) and on my first play through but so far I’ve been helped a ton by other vets. I really appreciate it! I dunno what the OP’s apprentice was thinking but nuking your friends’ camp seems beyond low. 
---
On the mic thing, I just started doing it and more and more it’s more comfortable and I dunno, it’s just easier to communicate confusion without game systems and the world etc. Appalachia needs more helpful people and despite what some griefers or ungrateful newbies do, I plan on, I dunno, just not doing that. This game is like post-apocalyptic SIMS for me so whatever.
---
Recently came across a camp in Flatwoods with about 500 Throwing Knives on the ground, walked right past it but thought it was just the game bugging out and spawning a bunch of items...the more you know.
---
Sounds to me like you don't have a decent squad and are salty about it. If you are on PS4, I will gladly show you how two players can successfully complete standard and three can successfully complete expert.
---
Personally I don't care if other people do the raids. More server stablity on my end.
---
Why can't you just be happy that we have some thing for the higher level players to do? Instead you are complaining. 
---
Find a squad.
---
Edit: spelling
---
I probably would if I ran into people like you.
---
Yeah, It's reddit people will always find something to complain about.
---
I’m on pc, I’ll probably be on in an hour 15 or so. Look for gonerboy, if something isn’t in stock, I might have it.
---
LMAO. No no. I actually like it when it glitches out when the messenger disappears and you still get the event completed status.
---
In my previous comment I said 3-6 stims, I've gotten about 10 plus a shit ton of ammo on a few occasions.
---
You know what this sub needs?
---
Totally Reliable Opinionated Limp Limbed Superegoists
---
I love this post! I've been both of you...total introvert, avoiding the mic and also the one bumbling around the silo alone and unprepared.
---
I predict the reintroduction of bugs, both as a Atom Shop cosmetic item and as its standard, computer terminology.
---
Thaaats not exclusive to just reddit : /
---
Or, team up with high level players who want to hunt raiders.  Be the bait.
---
It's the only time it's happened. Most of the time the enemies look in my direction and all come at me full force. Especially during the queen events, once she is down the onslaught of random enemies is ridiculous sometimes.
---
We have to pay so they can make sure no one makes a mod that gives you atomic shop items for free. Gotta keep them 20 buck "micro" transactions safe.
---
Typically trade Bobby pins when moving caps to my mule accounts.
---
Darn! Im on ps4
---
Well, yeh.  Why buy the game if you're getting the licenses for free....
---
Wha?
---
See... I was right.  
---
Nice.
---
It's either hit your Fiancé in the head with a brick. Though in fairness this may be detrimental to his health and your relationship. Or more expensive but ultimately safer. You may need to buy a second X-Box then you can play together.
---
Lame attempt to do a play on the old "Why buy the cow when you're getting the milk for free" saying regarding marriage.  Dad humor, I suppose.
---
It’s alright, I think I’m a little low on fusion cores, need to do a run.
---
Ohhhhhh I get it. Haha
---
This would be wonderful. I hate, hate, hate having to scroll through EVERYTHING. Haha.
---
I have/had a decent squad we were apparently the "world first" to do expert mode. At very least I was apart of the first group of streamers to do the expert mode vault. Most of us stopped playing though since we disliked the rewards/difficulty being too easy/latency issues. 
---
I have no idea where this elitist rhetoric that if I dislike the current vault raid rewards I'm somehow incapable of completing it came from. Do I need to show you a picture of me in the silly mask to have an opinion on the rewards? If you want I can link you to a previous post I made on reddit that was a  guide on how to complete dead in the water solo on standard with latency issues with a warfare build. 
---
Most higher level players (300+) that I know don't do the vault raids, with good reason. I want to change that hence the post. Also if you want laggy instances in future content so you can have less lag right I don't know what to say to you.
---
Ok, fair enough. 
---
People in general will always find something to complain about.
---
I like to sell Oil and Gold because it just feells right
---
Sooooo does it have to be my base you do this to? asking for a peice of shy.. person
---
check out r/fallout76filthycasuals
---
3/3 radkelp..HOW ?! Is there some secret to getting it to spawn quickly? I kill the enemies as soon as I see em and then I'm standing there for way to long with nothing spawning in. I don't think I've ever seen it at 2/3 let alone 3/3.
---
Was it a mod or a plan? I was able to equip and use the targeted hud as a mod (bought at command center vendor) without issue, but never tried building from plan.
---
you crazy! Keep it up
---
Isn't the term 'filthy casuals' a bit... I dunno, insulting? Are we new guys not allowed here or something?
---
Dude I got alot if keycards too. I'll go launch a nuke with ya. I'm not very good at human communication either.
---
Nice. Put an APB once the private servers hit and you'll be in charge of that pvp arena.
---
Sorry.  I had to do a double-take because I thought you said “working pornograph.”  My mistake.
---
No! I'd be happy to build something for your friend. (ps4 mainly)
---
I can't speak for all builds, but a commando can kill everything with a láser rifle. Fully fixed, it does not fall apart as some people say. Only problem Is copper and ammo. My commando uses an instigating automatic láser rifle and IT IS endgame material. You can go and do scorched Earth killing everything because it Is fast and Energy resistance Is low there.
---
Yup. Saw one floating in mid air...
---
Thanks! I think my camp will be here for a while, there are some other interesting places..
---
The pc version does not require a disk reader, so you should be fine. Just download the bethesda.net launcher, click the menu on the left, and choose "redeem code". (you'll have to set up a bethesda account first, obviously :P ) It's a pretty hefty download, but I'm not sure exactly how big since it's been a year almost since I had to redownload the whole thing.
---
thank you...I should have said that.  Following my instructions could lead to great disappointment!
---
Lol literally brand new for 8 bucks at my local store
---
You may be thinking of the *Hunter's* Long Coat which is from the roaming Responder Vendor Bot?
---
edit: left out a word
---
ok have a good one, ya hear.
---
Prettybs8lid with the civil war dress too
---
anything you don't use regularly for crafting is my answer to this question..
---
Int has stabilized, which is key.
---
You gotta kill the enemies that spawn after you pick them all up. They don't have any on them, but it seems like more spawns after you kill those. I mean maybe it's just coincidence, but they spawn everywhere so check every crook and nanny
---
Hey, which stove are you using at the cabin? Because there's a brewing station in the shed but it's nothing special and no mention of brewers yeast. I ask because I saw a mention of it in the game files but can't see any reference to it dropping.
---
did you drop a radex, also holster your weapon and drink water
---
I'll hold the door
---
Probably not. 
---
It’s one of those you get used to it really quickly, and dont notice the difference it until its gone.
---
Thats when you miss it.
---
foiled again darnit.  PC but thanks and great job!
---
I knew I was in for that before going up there and was mentally prepared for a beat down.
---
Pistol or rifle perks would apply.
---
Yes.  We need this for displaying items that are "junk".  The bears, Mr. Frizzles (or whatever the cat thing is) , and the souvenirs.
---
That does make sense
---
i also have a character on pc
---
How tf is any of it pay to win?
---
It isn't like console where those are already built in to the system. They'd have to devise and implement an entirely new chat system for a game where the friends system still doesn't work properly.
---
Yeah they pushed it back because they wanted it to be ready. Did you play through the mistress of mystery? That was pretty good imo. I think it's a good time to get in and level before wastelanders.
---
It’s all kind of fuzzy to me now, but I’m pretty sure they attempted to claim the workshop from me. It all went down pretty quickly.
---
Yeah, I know you can just scrap it all, but I don't like people building stuff at my camp.
---
These are pretty good. It'd be fun to role play as a child of atom priest. Just run up to other players and say some of these lines lol.
---
It didn't affect stealth in tests with it on or off. I'm not sure if that's a bug.
---
Getting a picture of a behemoth and a mutant hound is near impossible and I just think "well I guess I'm not getting all the dailies today". Which seems to be most days now.
---
I did play through it, and it was really good, I'm saying the majority of quests in the game are boring busywork.
---
It would probably be a good time to level up a new character, I've been wanting to try out a V.A.T.S. only build.
---
I’m a L145 melee.  But...
---
I use ballistics for things that fly....
---
Absolutely, the challenge to kill cave crickets at uncanny caverns is SO annoying, Server hopping for this challenge is a nightmare since its like a less than a 25% chance and if you do find them, their already murdered from someone else doing the challenge.
---
I'll give it a go, been awhile. Had a qe handmade from the purveyor before the sale ended, be a good gun to test on.
---
Heal speed demon and then you'll notice a difference.
---
It's the cook stove on the shed next to the crops.  Not the Brewing Station or the Spit next to he Cabin.  When I go to it, it has a Quest section with options to make 3 types of Mash but they all require Brewers Yeast.  I've been able to see this for months.
---
Dumpster fire?
---
Ghouls are people too. At least the non feral ones.  🤪
---
Seems to generally just be whatever does the most damage for the least inconvenience
---
What platform are you on?
---
there has to be some left, as the cult of the mothman is a faction, so some members must have survived.
---
Even if they design it so you connect to the same server instance it will still reset if it crashes, and also after maintenance, and the servers also seem to have a lifetime before they're reset anyway (you often notice it stops letting people in then eventually gives you a world shutting down countdown).
---
It only works on sprinting iirc, and also reloading. But yeah run around, then take some Rad-X and you should notice it. Unless you were actually on Rad-X when you made the post?
---
You sure did!
---
While I would LOVE to see even more map, idk if I would want a huge expansion along with Wastelanders or not. 
---
About to search and see if this has been posted about yet and possibly make a new post.... but I read that there are two new locations called Crater and Foundation. Thoughts on where those could be that would be just outside the current map? (We need the perspective of a WV native!)
---
Yeah I agree, abby's questline was kind of unbelievable. Been playing around with vats, it's a lot of fun if you like to grind for scrip. I hope wastelanders is fallout 5, that would be so fun. They might surprise us xD
---
Is the piece Laser or Ultracite Laser?
---
Ultracite. Probably should’ve specified.
---
Ahh I'm on xbox.
---
Darn, thanks for responding though
---
May try adding it to Approved Devices? I would think that'd override the blocking. My version could be slightly different, using an up-to-date VZW S7, but its got a section where you can manually add approved devices via MAC address.
---
Would be cool and give us other things to collect.
---
That's half the end game... collecting. Imagine it could play songs you'd found or purchased
---
I do like that fact as well. Just because I got a few already almost complete on my main, then the patch hit and now my other toons can complete it.
---
That would be pretty awesome, can't lie. Glad you didn't just give me flak for criticizing the game, I know that a lot of people in this subreddit probably would, I honestly do like the game, I just think it's too much like an early access game to justify it being priced at $60 AND also have an overpriced microtransaction store at the same time. I honestly think I and many others would praise the game so much more if it were a Free-to-play game, and they could even keep the Atom Shop.
---
If you play the game actively, it would be awesome if we could play it sometime :D what system you play on?
---
Really? I’m gonna have to try that out tomorrow then.
---
I wasn’t on rad-x
---
I did this the other day twice in very small PUGS and both succeeded, mostly because it least one of us stayed on "protect " duty. One we finished with 3voeople and two level 2 critters alive.
---
I love getting the grafton monster alpha ... so much easier
---
The mods don't have a level. The armor must be found on Power Armor (levels differ) or crafted from the super rare plans.
---
I don't play this game, you can nuke other people's campsites?
---
I love this idea!
---
I’ve also had a very similar idea. 
---
We should be able to collect sheet music! That way, when activating an instrument, you can choose between the different melodies/songs/rhythms you’ve collected for that instrument. 
---
I would be so happy hunting these down, and I’d even happily pay atoms for the occasional specialty song, as long as most had to be acquired in game like plans and recipes.
---
Why is everybody in photomode at OP's camp all of the sudden?
---
Mods plans and the mods themselves can be found throughout the world and at most vendors with enough searching, to learn the plans to craft the power armour itself, as far as I’m aware they are only obtained from treasure maps!
---
Yea I mean, on the road map we see 9 items, and 4 of those 9 are delayed until next year, 1 was completely removed (survival), and 1 is not an addition to adventure mode, leaving us with only 3 things in total from the road map and this includes the buggy and generally hated vault raid, and keep in mind this is only one of the two raids they promised.
---
is this like a reddit meme? 
---
"to the guy who may or may not see this post, sup"
---
Lol what a bunch of pussies. Yeah it’s the goddamn wasteland. Nut up or shut up. My god y’all are pathetic.
---
That is why this was a suggestion, an idea or a possible fix for those challenges that dont pop up for people no matter how long they were in the game. It wasnt a bitch fest, I've read the notes and I know that they are changing stuff. If they put "Swarm of the Suitor" or other challenges at 20-30 mins. on the day that they are dailies, that will not only help those of us who are on all day, but also those who work, school, both. Imagine coming home, being able to sit down, know you have 40 mins to play before you have to go somewhere and boom, your challenge event pops. You get it done and can move onto the other challenges, or play with friends. Then move onto whatever else you were planning on doing.
---
Yea. They show up on the map if you have a vending machine up.
---
Yet there's plenty of stuff with the terrible US flag on it smh
---
Depends on your total resistances. They have diminishing returns once you get past a certain point, so bolstering and vanguard may lose some effectiveness.
---
Pretty sure I know the beam splitter mod for Ultracite
---
I have scrapped all the utility items from the atom store. I never use them nor have had any use for them, and have better use for the budget space.
---
I have about 450 dr and 600 er, but I seem to take more damage
---
While I don't disagree with any of that, I'm sure a fairly large percentage of people with the collector got is using earned atoms, not bought.
---
The more they add, the fewer items you'll be able to have without buying atoms, so I'd look at little later to see what the adoption rate is for the newer things.  It's a bit too early to tell at this point.
---
Personally I would change the daily challenges to just be either any Public Event or even just any event, even if we have to do 2-3 under the same conditions.
---
I figured as much. I still found a way to poke some fun at Bethesda though 😂
---
more raider props but this time add decapitated heads and bloody spikes.
---
Rubber... handy for making the Marine Helmets to sell back to vendors.
---
My first instinct when I see them is not to take a picture lol that's a dope pic though!
---
I'm having problems completing this daily also. I was able to do it once or twice but it bugged after that at the last step as well.
---
Sell Serum Recipes
---
As far as mod *plans* you can get I think all of them from BoS NPC in Whitesprings or Phoenix down in Watoga.
---
If im farming WS, and im near the row of houses I bust out my TsE minigun and just hold down the fire button along the lines of cars in front of the houses and the ghouls come running out front in a group and then its playtime hahaha
---
Hey I scrapped a gilded minigun hoping to learn the paint, as well as vendored tattered field jacket and numerous other rares back in the 400 stash days.  Many others just like us, we all share in the misery!
---
Dont forget 10% while aiming, which I prefer over E for my sniper build.
---
FFR isnt much needed for a one shot one kill build.  The +10% while aiming I prefer over the Explosive since the explosive sets a second attack at +20% dmg, which is privy to its own DR, while +10% is a straight addition to the main shot damage.
---
I also dont have to worry about hurting myself or my gear if the creatures are too close to me.
---
Green Thumb perk, under perception, should be the one your after
---
Oh this would be sick! Please Bethesda!
---
i think luck makes it so that when you enter a cell (for example the top of the world) it spawns more props like sugar bombs, drugs, weapons, and plans. my 14 luck character always finds bobble heads and safes full of stuff as opposed to my lesser lucky characters
---
how do people lvl up so high? lvl 60 and feel like i’ve been playing forever but feel like I’m doing something wrong..
---
I've been playing since launch, but also dont forget xp buffs and such.
---
Oooh. Wonder if she’d pay you to mod it for her.
---
"Everything just works" 
---
Our lord Todd told us so.
---
Welcome to the club! We have pizza on wednesdays.
---
I like specifically would do Nuka world way early on replays for those paints
---
Mine follows me around the map. Like I fast travelled to the northern most part of the map and boom there he is.
---
Because people wanted an outrage click from you.  Looks like they got it.
---
Oh i didnt click on anything, i was told through word of mouth lol
---
If you don’t have the green thumb perk could have been a verdant season in the region you were in.
---
You're definitely not an idiot! We all forget simple things in this game from time to time. The above answer sounds correct, Green Thumb. Definitely helps when scrounging veggies and plants!
---
Its a bunch of people pissed off that private servers will be a paid novelty.
---
Fallout players these days think that the Devs should work for free, and the infrastructure for private servers should be free.
---
Someone has to pay the Devs, and the upkeep to run said resources.
---
Same. It freaked me out once til I saw its name. My camp is right next to the overseers camp and I was up at the pumpkin farm and there he was.
---
Yooonhg yeeeang...dude needs you to rage click that thumbnail shid so he can make his sweet outrage money.
---
I've done it a decent amount of times and I still haven't gotten the plans.  I would love a set!
---
Stealing for one of my desktop backgrounds.
---
No need to be sorry lol
---
In that case it’s either the telephone game coming to life, or people’s definition of pay to win.
---
Right now we have pay for absurdly minor convenience.  I’m curious where we’ll go from here but I can’t see P2W as I would define it anytime soon.
---
Oh I get it.  This started being a joke a long time ago.
---
Are you talking the enclave power armor? The scout armor? Or the officer uniform? What platform are you on? These are the things you need to specify.
---
