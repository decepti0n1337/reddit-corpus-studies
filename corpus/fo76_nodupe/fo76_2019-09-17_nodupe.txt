The Uplink daily op, the only one available right now, has Piercing Gaze as a permanent feature.  If you play a stealth build and plan on doing the daily ops regularly, it’s worth acquiring some slightly different equipment and a few perks to swap just for the occasion.
---

---
In my experience so far, the easiest method is to put together any suit of power armor, and mod it with either kinetic dynamos or emergency protocols.  The suit itself, any model, will give you 42% damage mitigation as a set and protect you from limb damage.  It’s also super durable and won’t break while being shot constantly.  Troubleshooter, mutant slayer, etc provide more specific protection, but they require much more maintenance, are harder to acquire and clog up a lot of stash space.
---
Kinetic dynamo is better for high health and/or using Dodgy for extra defense.  Every time you’re hit you gain AP.  Grim Reapers Sprint is also very helpful if you can use vats.  Both will keep Dodgy useful and prevent you from slowing down when AP is spent.
---
Your normal automatic rifle will be perfectly fine, but carrying a vampiric rifle will save a lot of stimpaks.  A while back I lucked into a b/25/250 10mm SMG that’s perfect for these ops, since I can’t sneak anyways.  It does excellent damage, degrades slowly, and I walk out with more ammo than I started with.  It jumps around a lot, but it has a small hipfire crosshairs with true mods and swapping Concentrated Fire for Ground Pounder.  Short bursts are the way to go.  I supplement the 10mm with a v/e handmade.  Both the bullet and explosive AoE provide healing.  I didn’t use one stimpak in today’s op, but today’s exploding blood eagles are just about the easiest combo to deal with.

The treasure hunter event
---
Treasure Hunter is not live, no.
---
When you main RNG sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.
---
"First, of course you can play this solo." - Todd Howard, 2018 E3
---
Treasure Hunter.
---
Any idea when it will be?
---
I travel directly to and from my camp ignoring the usual limitations. If somehow finding myself overencumbered it's not terminal unless your running solo.
---
I am not disagreeing one bit,  it would have been nice to be given the option with such a dynamic change is all I was requesting.
---
I'm not entirely sure, but I'd say within the next month.
---
I wanna use laser beam splitter f*ck me right?
---
[deleted]
---
I really like this new daily ops! This morning we did the robots like 3 times, same later with the volatile blood eagles, that one was so fun! With the robots I got some cool plans but with the eagles i got a legendary, something extra will make it awesome
---
Can you imagine ticks taking hundreds if not thousands of shots? What are they made out of, meteorites?
---
Turns out the Pipboy had a bug - they're not Mole Miners, but rather Mole Minors. All this time we were killing their young, whose voices were distorted by their breathing masks. We are the true monsters here.
---
I got the reactor plan today, I expected it to put out more power since it's four foundation squares big. It looks pretty neat tho. My other rare was the vault suit which is kind of lame
---
Alright, thanks
---
[removed]
---
Bethesda has not announced a specific date, as far as I know.
---
Best of luck to you too, I deleted the comment because I don’t want anyone to think that I haven’t realized or still think the same way, and have a good day/night
---
&gt; **CAN**
---
Yeah, you can also play many of the games I listed solo as well. That doesn't mean that's the way it's mean to be played
---
There is a timer. Some people found that out when, ahem, the AAR would not appear because of certain things affecting the UI. I believe it's 5 minutes (4:59 technically)
---
Why would that be live right now? That seems like something Bethesda would tell us about
---
:)
---
Dude they just suck more than you it’s not that hard lmfao
---
There’s a large copper deposit near the hornwright testing site that will yield a lot with excavator armor. Also the event Lode Bearing has a ton of copper deposits you can mine with excavator armor also.
---
Ok then take a workshop
---
Except it is largely supposed to be played solo, or can be. What are you talking about?
---
It'll all be another grind soon enough.
---
I'm level 300 and 210. Both are optimized for just combat. Bloodied PA heavy on the 300 junkies sneak commando on the 210. Both feel like I'm back at level 40. I can kill things but I use a ton of resources and constantly break my weapons. Not what I grinded to get at all.
---
But if you are given regular stims you can dilute them yourself with chemist and super duper!
---
Nope, I didn't mess with them today
---
I just removed the custom.ini so they wouldn't activate.
---
That solution worked fine this morning, and only became an issue this evening.
---

I say it's whatever people already said
---
And that could easily be interpreted as ‘I want to build my camp, so where is a good source of copper that would be nearby?’
---
That junk event isn’t starting again is it?
---
People still wouldn't understand how it works, so I see no reason to change it
---
Some people are somehow selling the new items
---
Well I use my shotgun on hard enemies to do a lot of damage up close. Rifle for picking things off in the distance. And melee for weak enemies.
---
But that was before the patch...so the rifle is kinda shit now. Melee is still ok but no more weak enemies...and shotgun feels weaker now.
---
I'd like to kill stuff in one or two hits if possible because if they get a hit in...it hurts. I think shotgun might be the way to go for that?
---
RNG hates me so I don't think I can find better weapons or armors.
---
So one run Elder rolls em all
---
8:40 on resilent robots, 7:20 on Eagles. Junkies Autorifle / Gauss Gatling for the boss
---
They are one of the enemies i just discovered to be strangely weak to poison.
---
Right, I would say most people have their perks optimized by level 60... with the new legendary perks I’d say you can be getting a bit more out of a build but the kind of effort it would take to get there from ground zero is not even remotely worth it. 
---
I mean why even do anything? I bet there’s level 300s out there getting murdered by mosquitoes and rats while only trying to build a new camp
---
It's a big 'I'm dead' so you can move onto the next target.
---
A bunker full of assaultrons and high level turrets would do it.  I'm not against challenge, but I think like you said above they just opted to make it impossible and that seems incredibly lazy.
---
Yes I do want copper near my camp but I don’t want to move it. Idk why people keep on saying that I need to move my damn camp.
---
It’s essentially effecting Sneak/Crit builds the most because naturally the Crit builds utilise VATS and would want to be getting that sneak multiplier... well additive. Can’t call it a multiplier anymore.
---
So in VATs whilst sneaking, no notification, Headshot: around 360 damage with my Bloodied handmade 
---
Out of Vats, same scenario but this time I do get a notification, and it does around 520-540
---
Not only is it not working in VATS but it doesn’t take a mathematician to notice that 540 is not 2.5x the amount 360 is.
---
Sounds like bungie
---
Honestly I do that with a shot gun not running bloodied. Shotgun in general is pretty good.
---
Stealth hasn't worked since the update!
---
F
---
(I feel you man, it's harsh but a needed change, I was WAY too overpowered that I was braindead most of the time.)
---
Saved pales
---
True, but I've talked to people who have had this happen to them.  Not just random internet strangers, people I've played with.
---
Plus, stuff disappearing isn't easy to record.
---
Mine were not working. Would not clip to anything and then would disappear out of my build screen
---
I've read so many posts like this today and I'm still not sick of them tbh and I'll tell you why:  
---
I felt like such a whiner last night (ps I hate whiners) because I was like, "why is this so hard?!?!?!" And I'm thinking, "maybe I'm just not skilled. I'm weak."  But you guys, I played for almost 30 levels without VATs! (Twas broken)  So I can hold my own. But I'm feeling like: fuuuuuudgggeee!  Anyway, peace be with you all. Let's get in this sufferfest together. Namaste...dead
---
This morning I woke up at Dropsite V9 and wanted to go to R&amp;G to dump some scrip legendaries and that was 16 caps I think. 
---
Had I noticed foundation was free travel I could have went there, then to R&amp;G for cheaper. 
---
Good to know.
---
At least ticks have an excuse to have damage resistance - they are hard to damage IRL. A giant mosquito or a hairless rad-burned dog, though?
---
Eh, I think there's plenty of people posting about how their favourite stealth ~~archer~~ build is no longer viable. And if your build is 100% stealth, then yeah, I guess you would have to do a bit of swapping of perk cards to make it work in a situation where stealth isn't an option. 
---
Personally, I can't be bothered to swap perk cards regularly, so I just play a mixed build.
---
Same, my build is just a plain PA heavy, most enemies I could deal with and I couldn't solo the queen or anything but I was happy. I have not played the new update tho, 23 GB takes a bit
---
Omg if you were on PS4 I'd give you what I could for the Animatronic Clown plan
---
Grab a resource map and look for copper or check a youtube video about it. However, if you have access to the excavator power armor it makes a HUGE difference in the amount you can get from those nodes. Also use super duper perk when refining the ore if you have it.
---
1 rare per day limit
---
daily for 6 weeks and your lvl 20?!
---
No because everything is now off of the BASE damage for your handmade which is 45ish dmg. The 82 is not the base damage. That is the base damage plus perk bonus dmg minus mob resistance. So we have 45 (base) + 45 (perks) + 45 (instigating) + 45 (sneak) + 45 ( headshot) - mob resistance.
---
It is lazy, and while I don't play that archetype, I think that taking away playstyles entirely is not the way to challenge your player base.
---
The elder is 80% chance for rare, can still roll the 20% nothing.  
---
5% for the lowest rank  
---
10% for the middle  
---
80% for elder  
---
also if you get elder time it rolls on all three but you can still get nothing.  
---

---
Seriously. I can’t wait to get that disease cure thingy!
---
Don't let this discourage you and remain vocal about it.  Hopefully they are listening and adjust base damages to some of the rifles.
---
Seems to have been fixed for me, if you meant the respawn glitch. I would get it about 70-80% of the time I died. For the last two days, I haven't had it once. This was by the far the most annoying bug for me, since sometimes the only fix was to ctrl+alt+del the game, so I'm glad it appears it's gone. Touch wood.
---
Lol. Wow I thought you were just intentionally being nice bc it was me...now it’s even nicer 🥰
---
Running heavy guns bloodied build with PA and its better than ever!! Absolute tank!!!
---
A mole rat taking four point-blank shotgun blasts. Lol, what the fuck.
---
Ok, so if I complete with elder, and I don't get a rare reward. Then if I complete again and rank elder, will I still have the opportunity to roll a rare?
---
Okay thank you
---
Yeah, nah. You (general term, not necessarily you OP) already have the choice in game to respec every time you level up, if you choose not too because you'd rather the perk coins/cards that's nobodys decision but your own. There's absolutely no reason to give out a free complete overhaul to your whole build.
---
I meant the fast travel glitch, as it took me 12 attempts to travel in to an event.
---
They are around the mire, so who knows
---
Please god yes. I hate having to keep everything in sync.
---
You can’t in a public team but if you make a private team you still can. I’m assuming this is so the wasteland doesn’t get covered in penis.
---
I've been playing steadily since release. I liked the game way better before wastelanders came out. I didn't want NPCs. I get the feeling they have no fucking clue what direction they want to go with this game. They just keep throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. I honestly think this update is going to do way more damage then good. It sucks all around. Tougher enemies and a huge weapon nerf in an already over grindy time gated everything. Once the newness wears off they're going to lose a lot of players.
---
I think you have to be on a private team, it won't let you if the team is public
---
No. My game play at level 17 got decidedly more difficult after the patch.
---
Having rank 3 of animal friend lets you tame most animals like cats, dogs, deathclaws, etc and if you play in passive mode other players can’t kill the pet. The only problem is that the animal can’t be tied to a location or quest and it has to be alone and come from a random encounter. Normal dogs and cats are harder to find than a deathclaw or yao gui, but once you have tamed the animal you can send it to your camp where it will hang around until it dies. Also they take up as much space as a turret.
---
Edit: If anyone is planning on getting a stronger animal like a yao gui or deathclaw you have to be double the animal’s level and most of the special animals like a chameleon deathclaw or glowing yao gui are not tamable because they are part of a random encounter with another enemy. Also waste land whisperer works just like animal friend it just effects things like rad scorpions and snally ghasters. As far as I know the snally ghaster is the only tamable cryptid
---
Come to my camp if you see me on pc!
---
No I don’t think so.
---
Do you think any build focusing on bows could work?
---
Right! I hate complaining. But I know for a fact I’m not bad at this game.
---
So if I complete elder and don't get a rare, I can go in again and still try for it?
---
I run good with salt and most weight managent cards and my damage is still crazygonuts in heavy gunner/stabilized, I dont keep anything else slotted like melee backup because why. But you can have a good mix and still absolutely wreck shit.
---
Been using PLM and a few other mods for over a year and have very few crashes. renaming the Fallout76custom.ini before starting FO76 and playing NW has been no problem since the start of season 1.
---
 if you are having to verify the game and re-download 3gb+ of files regularly makes me think there might be a problem with the disk that FO76 is installed on.
---
Just had the “waiting for a response from server” error pop when trying to launch a nuke and completely froze up and had to close the game- soooo just a heads up that this wasn’t entirely fixed. Actually the first time it’s happened to me as well.
---
Edit to add that this silo also then ate two keycards and rejected the correct code twice from another teammate who tried to launch the nuke after I closed.
---
No, you get three rank chances at a rare per day. The first two ranks are a very low chance. I think at elder it's like 3% drop rate. Every attempt after hitting all three ranks is the basic rewards. You have to wait until the next day.
---
"How dare you play a game in a way you can totally play it. Play it the way I want you to."
---
I did the same, but it’s not much fun alone and the ammo
---
Lode Bearing is frustrating because a lot of the ore nodes are bugged. But almost all of the copper work.
---
Where have they been asking for this feedback? I sent mine via the only system I know, their feedback/bug reporting site. Not on PTS, so that channel out for me.
---
This would have been ideal.
---
But... you just got them in a completely legit way, meaning they are available
---
Damn. That's rough. I haven't gotten anything but grenades and a handful of ammo as a reward. Maybe this is punishment for the 3 meat tendy plans and tato salad recipes at Meat Week.
---
Definitely good to know. So in order to perform test damage tests, it’ll be a safer bet to pick one particular enemy in one particular spawn as opposed to just one particular enemy type.
---
Did you turn in all 50 at once or over a period of time/different servers? I've got quite a few and was wondering which route to take or if it even matters
---
When is the next meat week? I've been on vacation and want that chalice! XD
---
I'll agree with you on wastelanders. I quit prior to it's released and only recently came back due to legendary perks. That's the one thing that kept me hopeful for the game. I still appreciate the game, and have seen no real difference in my capabilities prior and post one wasteland.
---
But I also don't run a bloodied junkies ridiculous meta build.
---
Aside from lower end areas with one shot enemies now taking a few shots to kill, nothing really changed for me other than the massive increase in exp I'm gaining.
---
Technically a mixed set of mob specific gear protects somewhat better than Vanguards. It's hard to find though because most people scrip it.
---
Same here. Both my high level characters are optimized for combat level 300 and 210. Feels like I'm back to level 40 again.
---
I did the one yesterday at The Burrows, and this is what I was thinking that I should've done.
---
So many items do. The flight helmets do as well. It's ridiculous.
---
Dude, you don't even have to explain! I get it!!!  My saint of a friend had to listen to me over analyze my game play last night, like I was trying to get a PhD on the subject.  He was so kind and wise.
---
All I know is, if y'all need a band of losers you want to hang with because you can't kill dogs anymore...look up my PSN. Borkicakes. 😜
---
They won't be level 50
---
If you're on xbox I'd be happy to run it with you
---
The burning noise is always there with super sledges!
---
Yeah all non-aggro creatures are locked at 5
---
nah it will be ok.. eventually if not from the get go
---
couldnt be more wrong. sure exp is not shared but you should be in a building team for extra exp (from INT), even if your off doing your own thing. not to mention the mutations that add additional special.
---
They capped critters at 5, was in notes.
---
Yeah, yesterday I had a few low level tag alongs, but they were fun to hang out with.
---
They do but admit why they gotta be all the way at the end. Them mother fuckers know what we want most and they hide it at the end.
---
They’ve basically rammed survival mode down our throats. It’s not fun to have to min/max a build to play casually. It’s not fun to craft ammo for hopefully the god-tier weapon you already have. I’m curious how many people get tired of it and vote with their feet and wallets. There are always new games to take my money to if I get to the point of apathy.
---
&gt; "How dare you play that game opposite the way it was designed. Play it the way the devs intended."
---
ftfy
---
Yeah I totally get it. Stinks to not have low level areas anymore. Unfortunately like the others were saying, your only option at this point since they’re probably not going to revert it back or do it any time soon, is to get stronger armor and weapons.
---
I don’t run a Tesla, so I honestly couldn’t tell you whether it was coincidence or not. I do know that numbers wise Tesla’s have always underperformed... their strength in PvP has always been that you don’t need to aim. 
---
So it is definitely feasible to think that it may be a result of the nerf.
---
You can also get wood armor to zero weight. This means you can carry around multiple legendary effect armors without an inventory penalty.
---
Hell yeah. Mines same as my name on here
---
I like the level scaling but, do we really need level 60+ prize/insult bots? Just because we are high level doesn’t mean everything has to match.
---
Agreed! I’ve maxed my sneaks at lvl 124 or so, and they don’t do squat now. I hate it...
---
Thats good to hear, haven't played the new update yet but I'm a PA heavy
---
Or jukebox functionality like ya know.. picking the song?
---
I now right 99th for the greenhouse like wtf?
---
Hmmm, I know some the wallpapered walls get glitchy. I had to tear down a couple walls to get my Cosmo game board off of walls. The signs did stick to my foundation blocks and I couldn't select them. Had to store the blocks to get them off. On plain walls they seem to be ok. Standard Bethseda I guess.
---
I've got an Ornate mole miner pail in my shop from the previous event a few months ago. 20k  - not able to put in a display case due to possible duplication so gotta flex somehow XD
---
Exactly.  There’s no pressing need to do so.
---
The only way I might consider investing a slot in Infiltrator is for a V94 raid situation.  If it saves me time when time is a precious commodity for success, I’ll use it.  Otherwise, I’d rather burn limited perk space on something that’s beneficial all the time.
---
I really like to take my time - sometimes I literally just walk around and enjoy the scenery! 
---
Have also re-designed my camp a countless number of times :)
---
Lol let’s all take bets how long it takes them to fix this. 3 weeks is my bet
---
How do you use a vending machine or stash box while playing the theremin? I have mine set up directly in front of Gramps chair next to my vendors so he's nearly always playing the thing while people shop lol.
---
Sorry for dropping the ball here. I've been thinking, if I give you too good a weapon, I'd ruin a lot for you.  
---
If you really want it, I have a 3\* junkies LMG you can have. my gt is fiddwilhead
---
Yup. I think Bethesda fucked up on their assumptions about their PTS results- because I almost guarantee most of the players on the PTS are ultra-optimized, hardcore, highlevel endgame players with good gear. I know most times I was on the PTS it was highlevel players experimenting with their range of various different godrolls.
---
Casual players are... casual. They aren’t the types to download a separate client and waste time on stuff that doesn’t even translate to their real character.
---
So all the reports they were getting were very biased. My characters all felt fine on PTS. Nerfed, yeah, but still playable. So I was reporting it was all OK. But I’m one of those ultra optimized players...
---
Snipers got hit a little harder than others, but you can switch over to commando pretty easily from there, and having done both I personally prefer commando.
---
Need to replace all the rifleman perks with commando ones, but many of the other perks can remain the same.
---
I mean which legendary perks did you picked.
---
Well played my freind..well played
---
Power armor bloodied heavy gunner is bomb
---
Incidentally, usually it's a higher file size.
---
Though this is a few months old m.2 ssd
---
Edit: none of the other games on the ssd have any problems whatsoever
---
I didn't have anyone with me. I put my troubleshooters armor on, and   wound up still dying a couple of times, but didn't think about it at the time that I could just run through there.
---
Yes, being allowed to wear broken gear would solve this issue. Always wearing a broken CSS would be the best alternative atm, but it precludes wearing any outfits with it. I would like to see the option to break armor pieces at a bench also. That would make this whole process a lot less painful.
---
Fallout was a single player long before multi, I only play it cause it's part of the fallout series. I play solo all the time.
---
WTF is with Level 50 mole rats anyway? I should be able to kick them to death, not have to empty a clip into them.
---
I almost died in Swarm of Suitors yesterday, and would have if I’d not equipped Born Survivor in the extra slot gained by adding legendary perks. Eight stimpacks later, my shotgun with Enforcer still hasn’t crippled the Queen’s spouts, and I’m running and jumping around like a noob trying to get into a decent firing position before the next Hunter staggers me ... it was a total shitfest that cost me nearly 1k ammo across my Handmade and Fixers.
---
And talk about bullet sponges ... an entire Quad Fixer clip to take down a Hunter? WTF
---
The person was being called a dumbass, the person writing the note used the wrong your for the note
---
I never had a problem with any of the waves or prime beasts tbh, and I’m full health using AA and TS weapons.
---
Oh, ammo, EA, poison, and 3 specials
---
Isn’t that a lvl 0 door?  You could spend five seconds unlocking it once every other day, or burn one of six legendary perk slots, and you opt for the perk slot?
---
Which gun do you prefer over it? Right now I'm using a BE Gatling gun. Before the update it was 1 shotting everything but not its 2-3 bullets. But at least I can do the daily ops and get about 1k U5mm and only use about 200 or so
---
Well lots of people were celebrating when the nerf was announced by testers because ‘yes yes that one asshole who was probably bloodied one-shotted my mole miner manager and he should be nerfed’. I predicted that when the nerf hits home many would start to complain. We’re witnessing exactly that. They had no idea what they wanted. People should always say NO to any nerf, but most are too dumb to voice  that. 
---
That being said, the new legendary perk features and ops are great and QOL improvements are tremendous. I like it a lot and the nerf is just a relatively small price to pay. It’ll just takes a moment to get used to the new parameters. Give it a few weeks and nobody will remember how effective their weapons used to be.
---
*applies ballistic fiber so I can strap the plates back on..... Then smashes it firmly against my own chest*
---
All those high levels singing praise to this update will soon enough be claiming its just another grind.
---
Personally, I am shocked that they did not contact you before making these changes
---
I keep getting them....got three out of five once.
---
Scrapped all of them.
---
Really? I’ve completed about 10 daily ops all below 8 min mark and haven’t gotten any rare rewards. Unlucky af I guess
---
Yeah, Gauss minigun is trash, used it for 5 mins then scrapped it for scrip...expensive ammo also.
---
Idk I've seen a lot of comments with people saying how much they like the challenge. I however do not
---
Survival mode challenge reward
---
One time Sofia followed me to Watoga and kept picking fights with Assaultrons... i defended her honor the first few, but after a while
---
That’s a very good way of putting it. Spot on.
---
Anything thoughtful to add? You think that high risk shouldn’t have that high of reward?
---
Would prefer actually discussion then personal attacks!
---
I would also consider myself a casual player, with probably around 200 hours ingame. The update haven't had any noteworthy effect on my gameplay style. I don't have a optimized build, by no means, but a stealth rifleman approach still works fine for me in open world exploration, and for events or groups of tough enemies, I just use heavy weapons.
---
The exception is molerats. Those are a freaking nuisance, and shouldn't exist.
---
So Hack and Slash does work with Unarmed weapons like the Power Fist?
---
I've heard that Explosive Palm isn't all that great so i'm looking for another Legendary Perk for my Unarmed build.
---
Let's go get murdered by mierlurks in the Summerville house! 🤘 "Good, cuz, I didn't even want all this ammo!"
---
The new meta will be uninstalling this game
---
Yeee
---
Even if they weren't, I would think nothing HP multiplied by 50 would still be nothing.
---
Fast travel back to your camp and see if she pops up. When I moved my camp it seems the area I picked she gets stuck outside in 2 spots. Gonna have to move so she comes inside. 
---
Once she shows up she'll give you the quests.
---
Welp, unfortunately, I’ve used up all the time I had budgeted today for banging my head against a wall. Have a good evening.
---
I have 2 high level characters. Level 300 and 210. One is a bloodied heavy gunner and the other is a junkies commando. I only recently switched from plain builds on both and saved all my other good weapons so it's no issue to switch back. That being said I feel like I'm back to level 40. I don't want to constantly farm resources and while bloodied was op, nerfing the most popular build into oblivion probably won't do good for long time player retention. It was bad enough after the TSE nerf. I can just imagine what's going to happen in a month when people get tired of constantly being attacked by high level enemies. I used to love roaming lower level areas with an explosive pipe rifle. Now it's utterly useless.
---
I'm kinda on the fence with your build, you have your points spread out a little too much for my taste, yeah he'd be tanky but that's not a sniper's purpose, blocker wouldn't make a huge difference on a Vanguard build since you run around at full health with damage resist bonuses, you'd be better off with traveling pharmacy and the high capacity backpack mod for added carry weight. I'd want concentrated fire in perception on top of the 4 other perks. Also , having a maxed gunsmith equipped at all times seems like a waste of points, I'd use 3 of those on concentrated fire and 2 on sneak which you didn't put in your build.  I usually don't use a lot of endurance or charisma  with sneak riflemen builds so I can get lots of luck perks like Better critical, critical savy and Four leaf clover. Overall I think the build is good if you want to do a little bit of everything without being great at something, you're focusing a lot on survivability when in fact dying isn't such a nasty thing. (My playstyle is a bloodied riflemen "glass canon", so I've made peace with dying.) Do you intend on using any mutations like eagle eyes, healing factor or speed demon?
---
I get his point.
---
Say you were building a house for someone, you were buying all the materials out of your own pocket to build it and then you finish building it and the person your building it for says he wants it completely different and you need to start again and built it out of your own pocket before you get paid. Pretty much same concept lol
---
I’m not too fussed by it, but at the same time, if you want to change things to turn the game upside down they probably should have something in place so people don’t get completely screwed, cause let’s be honest, the only people it doesn’t really effect as much are people that play all day and are lv 300+
---
Yeah I am investing points on the specials first and foremost. But some cards that you can max out like super duper I also only have one in and feel like it still procs often enough to spare the two extra points
---
My level 56 doesn't have this and I threw it together.

---
All of the shotgun perks are in there with others to increase damage, crippling, and exploding enemies. If you're not 50 then depending on how many Legendary slots you have, I would take ammo factory first.  
---
My 2nd char still does quite a bit of damage thankfully.
---
No offense taken man,  your comment was pretty mild and I appreciate the points you made.  I think you're on top of it in regards to the message these updates have been sending.
---
Gatling plasma is great for easy ammo.

Ooh I like this idea
---
Max and equipped
---
One wasteland should activate post level 50 or can be activated in menu. 
---
Personally I love it so far, I hope the experience doesn't change for those who like it. But it definitely sounds like it needs to accommodate for low levels better.
---
Okay thanks bud. Appreciate it.
---
It's not bad.
---
The liberators are giving me PTSD.
---
I am a level 100 but I got there on stupid stuff and double xp a lot. I suck. So best advice is stick together and die patiently right? Thanks, bad grandma ang.
---
I am seeing the same thing.
---
Right? If a chicken can have stars why can’t I
---
I just ran it and there are a bunch of yao guais. Great.
---
I’m using TSE Mini in ops, but normally running an exe’s explosive .50cal since I can’t seem to get any other .50cal from murmur. Want a TSE .50cal as well but their prices have gone up.
---
You'd be a pretty shit businessman/contracter if that's how you ran your operation that's for sure.
---
Edit: again not aimed directly at you, just you as a general term for any person.
---
This is just my [recommendation](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4355db&amp;d=sb2c72i11a71a04lt2lu2l71p00pc2sd0so0sp0eo2cu0ic2l12a32as2su0s40ss1sm0s20sn0se1&amp;w=eh2cd1cm0ce0&amp;m=c49eg6i&amp;am=1g2030-1626-16-1622-16&amp;wp=w9w5w1&amp;wm=152536-1i-17), you can make of it what you want. It splits perks between shotguns/2-hand melee. You can easily swap in heavy guns for the melee,  or focus more on shotgun dmg. 
---
Right now, VATS with shotguns is broken, you can do insane amounts of damage with certain, easily obtainable, legendary combinations.
---
I don't need it because I got everything I need in Flatwoods. It's just way more easier after I got Tato salad recipe. When I'm hungry or sick, I just go back to Flatwoods to craft some food and disease cure.
---
Looks like they changed reset from Tuesday to Wednesday, can you try this code for bravo?
---

---
Yikes
---
Not very good either, better weapons out there for sure.
---
Well the ‘resilient’ thing is just too much bs, it’s like ‘your bazooka won’t work but your pocket knife can kill us’. Too immersion breaking. I don’t mind fighting an entire ops with only melee and no guns, but this resilient drama is too fake. I hope that’s the last one of it.
---
Ah nice very brave of you. Playing it on the safe side, altho I wonder what the difference in procs would actually be from max to rank 1.
---
My camp is next to a train station cause I liked the land and, didn't notice there was a train station near me. I was pretty new when I threw it down.
---
Oh right, sorry was thinking of whistle in the dark
---
No kidding. I once had a guy give me a full set of X01 power armor I was maybe a lvl 63 and had just burned through getting the excavator armor so X01 was much better.
---
You must be such a weak player.
---
Thank you.  There is a startling number of folks in the comments who seem to disagree, so I'm glad to see this said by someone else.
---
I'd try rank 5 instead.  I have it at 5 and it's manageable.
---
ok? in that scenario the point is moot. obviously.
---
Agreed.
---
I admit I was on the side of "it's not that hard" but then I remembered what a pain it was to create an alt from scratch even before the update. So then I made a new character from scratch, didn't give myself any items, did not use legendary perks, none of it. It IS more brutal.
---
They need to adjust things like give a permanent damage and health buff until you hit 50, and then maybe an permanent XP buff up to 100. That and some re balance for low DPS weapons.
---
It is when VATS sneak attacks literally do not work.
---
Yeah they're effortless, but a majority of this game is casual players. It's not a sweaty MMO so there's no reason for it to have these kinds of mechanics.
---
You would've had to have engaged him in PvP in order for him to do damage to you and your base. Turn on pacifist mode.
---
Don't know what system you're on, but if you're on xbox and need any help rebuilding it, hit me up. I don't mind helping out. 
---
Sorry you had a jackass stop by!
---
Vote with your feet. Dont like it,  don't play it. Thats what I do.
---
Nah. I'll play everything the way I wanna play it and be happy knowing you're somewhere seething about it. Remember, none of us complained about people playing the game, multiplayer or solo. However, you have gone off on multiple tyraids whinging and moaning about solo players because it hurts your wittle feelings we aren't exactly like you. Now kindly f off and go play one of your circlejerks.
---
I know exactly how it works I just chose to not exploit it.
---
A level 50 legendary chicken will start a new cult 🙏🏻
---
“Wouldn’t it be nice?”
---
Exactly. 100% this.
---
I can't verify whether hack and slash worked, it doesn't give a physical or audio queue when it does. Exploding palm was a riot, though. I saw it doing useful amounts of damage to nearby enemies.
---
My boyfriend and I didn't have issues with it until we put on Secret Service armor. But I've also seen people have the fast travel bug while not in SS armor, so idk how much our experiences hold up.
---
It's not much of a challenge imo. Granted i'm not a bloodied build but not killing something in 1 shot isn't the end of the world. Enemies aren't that tanky and I barely use my legacies unless it's in the ops for the final boss. I'm a junkie's build.
---
To be clear, she's at my camp. I just dont' know what to do next.
---
Not for the door, for safes to get Technical Data.
---
Im doing just fine as a full hp unarmed melee, 1 shoting anything level 50, 2 or 3 shoting anything above that. Why do you struggle ?
---
Patch notes have a whole section on camps &amp; workshops. Might be this though:
---
Exploit: Addressed a C.A.M.P. budget exploit related to Generators
---
You may have just been caught in the crossfire, so to speak.
---
The witching season is upon us.
---
This is a great idea 👍
---
Its caused by things that heal hp over time ' like healing factor , certain foods, or the healing buff you get from guided meditation for example
---
On the topic of challenge... if all those assaultrons were in stealth by default, we'd really be cooking!
---
Aye, that's me.  Your resident healer tank.  Nobody is a leech under my team; do as much or as little as you want, as long as you're happy and having fun!  I bet a lot of others feel the same, too.
---
The miniature light houses in the light house have 3 copper each I think
---
Leave the world? It's unavoidable in some cases, happened to me below level15 2 yr ago, and I just moved on. Keep posting about it and they'll keep doing it, the reactions is what keeps them doing it. They're probably waiting here for posts like this and you've given it to them.
---
The wasteland can be a dangerous place sometimes. I was in foundation minding my own damn business when some lvl 164 dude with three claw mole miner unarmed kept power attacking me. So I bottled up my anger and then unleased my magic vamp mini complete with purple bat paint and busted his ass, looted his junk and hopped servers. You will get your time to shine one day. If anything server hop if you sense there's gonna be too much jackassery
---
Im sure, but the fact a rank 5 card is basically required for these types of weapons to even function at a reasonable level is kind of ridiculous
---
They cap at 100
---
I fully agree with you, but some players value convenience over maximum power.  It’s like arguing politics.  Just agree that each side will find the other insane and idiotic.  Neither will find value in an opposing perspective.
---
How would someone go about downloading this mod? I assume there's not a mod manager to do it for u
---
I like the absolute perception buff robots have, but I don't think other enemy types should have the same ability. Maybe mutant hounds, Blood Eagle PA users, and mongrels should have it too.
---
Because gunpowder doesn't fit the definition of junk.  
---
"Junk" is either a base component (scrap) or something that can be scrapped down into base components.  Gunpowder isn't a base component because it's crafted from cloth and acid, and you can't break it down into anything.  It's the same reason ores are stored as misc, they aren't base components and  they can only be crafted into their scraps but not scrapped themselves.

Fast travel game wide should have been free from the start.
---
You are not a casual player if you take the time to write a comment this long lol
---
I got that yesterday, today I got a plan for vault 94 jumpsuit
---
So having the extra like +5 strength means I can get 15 str at 10 naturally with the +5 and still get 15 points in normal cards? If so this seems like the play versus all these other legendaries with the exception of ammo factory which you could just put on when crafting and replace it after.
---
I think I'll be unequipping Travel Agent. Thanks for the tip!
---
I have a tse rifle, what is your build?  I wann try this commando thing
---
Store your prime weapon in stash box. Then re-login. Then pickup the weapon again. Then favourite it.
---
I’m guessing you’re after T-60 paint jobs.  To each their own, as long as it makes you happy.
---
Yup.  Don't get me wrong, I value qol too, but this perk is one step too far.
---
Pretty sure the notes from bethesda literally said critters will cap at 5.
---
got two today as well. the solar panels and the industrial light bulbs.
---
Yeah sure there are bugs, that's not what we're talking about. This post and the people complaining saying its too hard after patch 22 have bad builds and crap gear. Don't care if I come off as rude, thats how it is.
---
Amen!
---
Lol maybe your just trolling, but that’s how a lot of labor work runs, I used to do concrete edging, we would buy the materials do the work and then get paid once it’s done. 
---
If we done the work to plan, and then they changed the plan once we were finished wouldn’t the person that changed it be shit? Lol
---
I hope they'll be open to making adjustments after feedback from the community, but we'll see how it goes, and what the general community consensus is after people have had some time to experience the new system.
---
There damage output is also ridiculous, I have one, I know.
---
The weapons shoot faster than the game can 'count' at first. Then it 'catches up'. Hence the term 'rubberbanging healthbar'
---
it say 20% on card at max rank.
---
Also - i wasnt going to take it yesterday because as many others i thought the healing was a bug.  But then one of the Bethesda community managers said it wasnt.
---
I knew from playing in the PTS that i wanted to make a tank build so this was a no-brainer for me .
---
I have also maxed whats rad and i dont think i am going to need radaways ever again - so a hidden weight redux bonus here :)
---
They went overboard with melee. I will be surprised if they don’t buff it back up a little bit. My unarmed build is doing less than 10% of the damage it used to. Feels like sneak damage is screwed up right now too.
---
Just did. Unfortunately, I don’t have the resources to fix my diner now
---
In hindsight they should have implemented One Appalachia once you hit 50 if possible? Even better is let there be One Appalachia servers and the old school pre One Appalachia servers.  I'm going to start a new character and see whats up.  As a level 120 I was loving it.  Granted I had a junkie rifle build with the right perks going into this.  Power Armor is the route to go pre 50's though.
---
Makes sense now thank you
---
Just a bit of a downer that I can sweat it out one day a week but I guess that’s how they get you
---
Maaan, my last nuclear card and the code works. Woohoo, at last got this Trophy! It’s like 02:30am and work in the morning. Huge thanks, it’s gonna be a great day today!
---
I sure am. I think I have three left. I keep getting shielded plans instead.
---
I’m just ignoring it, since I don’t think it’s worth the time to unlock or hack anything at all.
---
Google ``nexus mods fo76`` then sort by most popular (all time)
---
Main qol ones are
---
* perk load out manager
---
* Better inventory
---
* there is one that allows ye to use a number imput instead of sliders for menus.
---
No, they made this game for the pay to win crowd to buy repair kits. It's painfully obvious if you've played any sort of game with any pay to win content.
---
It is precisely because of such  food/chem builds capable of extreme  multiplicative damage stats that has led to the rebalance. Suck it up, test the game for more than a few minutes, and rebuild just like every single other player out there.
---
I totally understand that, I just wanted to point out in some instances the difficulty reflected may be caused by unforeseen issues.
---
But I do agree, food builds always gonna food build.
---
I was out in a nuke zone collecting nukes flora on my level 131. Saw an assaultron and got insta smacked.
---
Glad to see Bethesda soo quick to respond when an issue like is posted lol what a joke.. so quick to want to fix this issue ehh? How about a safe trading system implemented into the game while you’re at it lol
---
Oh that makes sense, thanks
---
still inclined to think that there could be a problem with the m2 ssd, just because it is new(ish) doesn't necessarily mean there is no fault,and also just because none of the other games have a problem running doesn't mean there isn't a fault with the area that FO76 is installed on. 
---
do you have another drive you could temporarily install FO76 onto to see if that helps? ( you can copy the FO76 folder to it, then reinstall 76 there and it should just verify the files without downloading them.)
---
$$$
---
I love that so many completely over powered bloody builds are feeling some pressure now.
---
Now they get to feel what it means to actually be glass cannon instead of a unstoppable killing machine
---
I’ve heard it changes at 1pm est
---
Ok I am with that and I get it,  now I have to level at 275 for each of my respec's, then add to the  levels to obtain the cards/ranks for my changes.  Which up until a few months ago was just finalized. So maybe not a FULL respec but some love.  Im not lazy just may take several months until desired is achieved.
---
Oh I agree for sure
---
I get that but it actually makes sense now that they’ve changed it, whys OP mad
---
 Because now you will encounter a level 100 mouse.  It may have more HP than you.
---
How long have you played? Can you actually provide insight?  Have you played last two days with melee and realized it’s useless?
---
Edit: please provide me with how many hours you’ve played as well, since you went for a personal attack of playing for two minutes in the last two days (almost 20 hours last two days FYI :)...)
---
Yeah they definitely would, and I wouldn't change anything until they've paid for the work you've already done as it's not your fault they changed their mind. I'm a boilermaker so I understand how it all goes down, and I/any employer Ive had haven't/wouldn't start a job until at least material cost is covered.
---
&gt; They fired their nerf guns in desperation as they backpeddled and were slaughtered. I cannot imagine how much more difficult the Colossus just became. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As far as I could tell, he's actually fine. Wendigos were planned/balanced around being lvl 75, and are still lvl 75. I'd guess he may be easier than SBQ now, because his adds are more predictable. He's a little harder to chew through with damage nerfs, but it was pretty rare to see him get almost killed, and then time run out. He's generally not mutated when the timer runs out, or dead with 5-10 minutes to spare.
---
updoot for dross toss ref!
---
&gt;  but haven’t finished B3 because the combat is too easy
---
 
---
Just chiming in about this detail, Finish the story and jump into mayhem 10, we'll see if it still too easy without a proper build and good anointed legendary weapons.
---
My friend is like this, he uses whatever he picks off the ground because it's legendary or it looks cool. He tries to use them, but doesn't have or equips the perks said weapon requires. He was struggling against 2 mole rats, then started to rant about the update cause he was getting smacked about.
---
I will try that in an hour and report back
---
That is true, but the same standard would apply to The Elder Scrolls. And ESO is not suggesting solo.play any more than this game is.
---
The entire fallout series being single player doesn't mean they **can't** make a multiplayer game.
---
There's no rush man, just take your time and try enjoy it. It's worth fiddling around and tweaking with your build anyway.
---
Hey! Thanks for a thoughtful response. I’ve notice that even nukashine alone doesn’t do what it says (and doesn’t work with party boy).
---
Sneak crit is also not proking (unless that’s how they meant.
---
AGAIN! Thank you for a thoughtful discussion! 
---
Where
---
Well, the community asked for a Bloodied nerf, no mic emote, more endgame content, legendary perks rework (both stats and cost wise), to bring back double sided wall trick, list goes on long enough to not call this a one-off imo
---
But anything except the floater grenades. They are both rubbish to use and now so freely dropped in game that crafting them is a worse than bad use of resources.
---
Buy SS or T-65 depending on what armor you use most.
---
All melee got hit really hard. I am an unarmed sneak build. Before the nerf I was easily doing 400 damage, which I’ll admit is a big number. After the nerf, I took of my weapon that increases my strength and increases my damage by 10% (mutants) and I was doing 267 damage. I put on my gauntlet and I do 270. And without my damage boosting perks, I did 250 damage. Either bethesda can’t do math, or there’s some shady thing going on here. When they said they were doing a damage nerf I thought they were talking about unyielding armor and nerd rage and stuff like that, because having a 100 strength seemed slightly overpowered, not at all melee weapons in general
---
Why are you being downvoted so heavily ? Everything you said is true.
---
The best summary of current situation.
---
Daily ops
---
They should remove the stacking and make it work like guns and then buff the damage back up. No one wants to go around hunting for different types of meat so they can do decent damage which still doesn’t come close to a fixer or good heavy weapon.
---
Woowwwww. I see what I am to you! 🤣
---
Soooo much complaints. Sooooo much. I'll start a new character specifically to test how hard the game is .
---
Exactly this. For me this was an excuse to cause more weapon and armor damage to sell more repair kits. Notice no new events drop repair kits.
---
Thank you for letting me know!
---
More cultists and raiders. They have tons of stims
---
I’ve been enjoying it. It feels like the world is more threatening now.  Now I would like to see some regions get an overhaul with spawns and locations. The toxic valley is severely lacking and the ash heap isn’t all that exciting to me either. I also wish all the spawns weren’t so fixed, I’d love to see a pack of deathclaws or something randomly wandering through a region unexpectedly
---
Sorry for the Necropost, but the Lead Designer and Writer for Wastelanders was Ferret Baudoin, who also was the Senior Writer/Designer on FO4: Far Harbor, while Will Shen was the Lead Writer/Designer on Far Harbor (Shen is currently working almost exclusively on Starfield, because he has had little involvement with FO76 or Wastelanders.)
---
Fun fact: Ferret Baudoin has a great resume, he was a Lead Designer/writer etc. with \*both\* Obsidian and BioWare, on  games such as KOTOR 2, Dragon Age: Origins and it's Awakening expansion. He also worked at Black Isle right before it shut down and was part of the original FO# Van Buren team.
---
  Weirdly enough, not many people are aware he's been with BGS for a good while now, he wrote and designed a lot of Fallout 4's best side quests like: Last Voyage of the USS Constitution, Silver Shroud, Human Error  , and also wrote Deacon and Curie. Also the Railroad Faction. Here's Baudoin's linkedin profile, [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferret-baudoin-b1929b1/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferret-baudoin-b1929b1/)
---
This...is brilliant!
---
You are a saint, thank you!  I’m going to regroup my character tonight along these lines :)
---
I'm lower level than you and honestly still kicking ass, I never ran anything doing stupid amounts of damage and was happy with what I had because I could get by solo, and nothing's changed in my case.
---
I agree, first time in a long time that I've felt my weapons mean something and not just something that I point at enemies to make them die instantly if that makes sense.
---
I've done enough traveling. 900 hours on my main char. I've discovered majority of the map. Now I can understand for a lower level char. Ya you're still discovering locations. I get that.
---
I liked the update
---
Ok but I haven't got one and as far as I know I need to be LV 50 first . Which still brings up my issue now that it's too much of an uphill struggle
---
Probably is part of their thinking.
---
Sorry i took song long kiddo didnt coperate tonight.
---
Ok so sneaky torso shot AA 10mm on a glowing mole miner:
---
- 74 damage first shot
---
- 117 damage every shot after
---
Major increase
---
For future post. If you add image to Imgur and put the link in your post, then you can “add” a photo(s)
---
I feel the same way too, being a level 350 and wandering the forest with a pipe wrench just wrecking enemies when I’m a bloodied commando build was no fun, I like this challenge that the update brings makes me feel like I’m playing a game.
---
No. I have a brilliant strategy that cannot be contained by your artificial rules! You'll look down at me exsanguinating on my knees and scream "help us with the objective, moron" then I'll look up and whisper "I am bleeding, making me the victor."
---
That does seem like an odd choice on their part.
---
Now?  Lunchboxes
---
By definition from many hardcore players, who see I don’t touch PVP, am not able to run silos solo, still think ghoul slayers isn’t half bad, don’t go anywhere ear the trading market, think that me selling serums for at least 550 is stupid... I am very much a casual.
---
seems like the ai got downgraded too.  id love to see an actual balance pass over the weapons (why a 556 does more damage, unless its a lever action rifle; and a black powder weapon damagaing as much as a rocket launcher, what? lol!)
---
But why do only these two specific legendary variants of these guns that I have seem to do this? I've tried other legendaries and non legendary versions of these guns and none of them seem to have this affect.
---
Pack of deathclaws?! There is only so much shit my underwear can handle man
---
I agree with that. It is a little much to have every single creature in the wasteland be a beast. But at the moment I hope they focus on getting balance between the weapon types and fixing VATS.
---
I want the Solar Panels, they look great.. Instead I got the reactor..
---
Log in and out. Make sure the console is on land and not over water it can bug a bit if on a platform over water, if she is in water can be impossible to talk to. Fast travel away and back. There can be a delay of a day for the actual next quest after placing the console I had this occur with Beckett after doing raider punks daily. After the day I did Beckett quest chain fine. It’s seems that when you replace or place a new companions item in camp it can take a day reset to get it to work.
---
I mean, it is a bug
---
Seriously. Felt like and point and click adventure last week
---
Dabney homestead is the workshop with 3 copper deposits
---
Saaad dude
---
Yea todays is a cakewalk compared to yesterdays
---
Fallout doesn’t have bugs only features
---
Idk as a black dude wearing a skull faceplate and the new BoS outfit, I get some haters here n there. Especially when I glitch thru a bunkbed like Ward and magically max my charisma cap.
---
Ah but you’d feel like you’re in a wasteland again then, yes?
---
I spent a good portion of the op yelling at the boys for not dying. Go so frustrated and panicked that I forgot I could bash, found a damn knife and would switch weapons and knock them down to nothing switch back and poke em. Most fun in days.
---
Will never happen unless its instanced. It would delete the server. Imo camp budget exploits do nothing but hurt the game for everyone else it causes disconnects etc..
---
Also interact talk to her to start next quest it doesn’t start automatically
---
story, character, emotion?  how about a shooting gallery AND a fetch quest instead?
---
U got me there. Time to invest in some depends
---
My overall favorite play style is explosives,  explosive everything.  By no means is it the most powerful, but it is generally fun to play.  Laying nuke mines, spamming mini nukes, or just plunking away with a 40mm nade launchers is oh so satisfying
---
Definitely fun. Went in using 5mm Gatling, reloaded once, probably came out 1000+ in front, some drops 140, 540 on completion. Mega love for the new Daily Ops...
---
Thank you so much for such a detailed response! I appreciate the effort you put into helping me out with this.
---
I had originally planned to do no-vats/no-mutations (I do use VATS occasionally but usually just to find enemies). I guess I will have to change it though, I will look into moving some points into Luck and stuff to try and make it a better build
---
I should have guessed that...thanks!
---
Yeah, a lot of people have put 100's of hours into the game bud that doesn't actually equal exploring the engaging in the world space.   
---
If you find yourself constantly fast travelling to one spot to another just to get through the minimum daily requirement... your probably not taking in anything around you and are playing the game as a checklist of objectives..  
---
I don't blame you, the game is obviously designed to keep people hooked like most MMO's but in saying that it also means hours played doesn't equal time actually experiencing things.  
---
Also I said nothing outright against Fast Travel, just that if they're going to implement then give it some sort of real world explanation.
---
No, you shouldn't be able to to 10k damage.  Period.

---
because for Bethesda there's no 'baseline', for Bethesda to add anything that has been industry standard for decades is like re-inventing the wheel to them.
---
Agree. Though I spent maybe 20 seconds of wasted time finding the right room and the boss at the end. Not much room for mistakes on solo.
---
Imposter sheepsquatch helmet/mask? A possible drop from the Encryptid event
---
Did you see the furry horned helmet in the atomic shop or out in the wasteland?
---
Only when it cycles back through the shop unfortunately
---
I only have one character. I made alta to gain levels for dailies, but that's it. My main is 210.
---
It's a packrat with rifleman. I swap between most ammo types that have rifle options. I only use anti armour, and have since after tse nerfs. With standard PA as defense, and just my currently stocked rifle as offence, every other perk besides tank killer and 3/3/3 rifleman, I do fine. Rarely go down, and almost never have issues with damage. Aside from my lack of an ability to melt SBQ and Earle, I never have trouble, not even now.
---
In fact, in lower level areas, I have started gaining exp much faster for the trade that I don't one shot anymore. I now farm events in the forest and am gaining levels faster than ever.
---
In higher areas, I'm tankier and more powerful than before. Not much more, but I usually take the same amount of ammo, but a fair amount less damage. Overall, this had been a boon for me. But then again, I didn't play meta, and I don't require an OP build to enjoy the game.
---
That's exactly what we need, a taxi. Make it a radstag drawn buggy, driven by a scavenger.
---
All items that cost Atoms will return eventually. Usually within 3 weeks.
---
I agree that hunting meat day after day is terribly horrible and leads to me playing less or not at all some days since I got the final level of “season 1” 
---
I still stand firm my handmade is better than my fixer!
---
Edit: you do know you can stack items for weapons too lol? Food, bobbles, magazines.... stacking isn’t unique to melee
---
You could have a “magic” variant, depending if you’re using vats or not
---
I thought this would be the case,  its not as fun having 2 characters kitted similarly. Unyielding meta is a bit boring when there is a clear easy to get best armour.  I was hoping everyone would say thorn is a beast for stealth commando but I knew it wouldn't be nearly as good .
---
Got the Vault 94 Jumpsuit plan yesterday, today I managed to get the plan for the Power Reactor.
---
I want the BoS outfit and Solar Panels though.
---
You have explained my frustrations very well. My camp is placed between The Wayward and Flatsprings so there are a handful of reocurring mobs to introduce new players to. My camp happens to be placed where the Mr. Handy and 3 mongrels spawn. I purposefully picked this low level area so that I didn't  have to repair things constantly and to sell items to low level players. 
---
I logged in for the first time today since the patch and wasn't sure what to expect from the update. Immediatly my turrets are going off and kill the robot, but the 3 mongrels over power one of my turrets and are attacking my character. My home build is based off the mobs being lvl 1-3 and not lvl 41. 
---
I decided to walk up and down the road between Flatwoods and the Gorge Junkyard, areas where it was rare to see anything over lvl 3. I ended up using 10 stimpacks and several pieces of my armour were destroyed along with using an extreme amount of shotgun ammo. 
---
I'm not happy and will not be playing again until this leveling is sorted out. I could understand the lvls going from 3 to 10-15 just to make the experience a little more worth killing mobs in early game areas, but One Wasteland is a joke. I dont know anyone that enjoys every battle in a game being life or death.
---
SS Underarmor, SS chest piece, dense and the Jetpack Mod
---
Brotherhood gas mask - looks so badass lol
---
You have  magic weapons.  There are some vidoes on it on the interwebs.  Its a damage efdect that makes you deal crazy damage.  It must be hard to fix on Bethesda end.
---
Dude right! Instead of me waving my arms in the air hopefully you notice I could be shooting more things! or in the event of those awful robots that need murdered with melee I could be hitting them in the face instead of waving my hands for you to get back here!
---
I didn't say they couldn't make a multi player game of it. You asked why someone would play solo, I answered why people play solo, a lot of people.
---
Lol why? I’m level 459, with 1800 hours and I spend so much time collecting everything.  Why should I be a mosquito compared to a ranged weapon with no actual risk?
---
Mostly talking about the other one, tbh, you're fine as long as I can throw my balls at you.
---
I LOVED today’s OP, it was fun watching everything explode. I’m sure it would have been better with a lunchbox though.
---
CONFETTI EVERYWHERE!!!!
---
Totally agree with it not really being a one off, guess my grievance is moreso the fact that while some things are getting addressed, there's a whole bunch of other things that have needed fixing for a hell of a long time that don't seem to be getting any attention. But so long as they consistently listen to the community in a meaningful way I'll be happy enough
---
all that matters is ttk.  if you can still 1 or 2 shot enemies what difference does it make if the number that pops up is 639 or 2500?
---
It's only worthless if it now takes 10 shots but most of my characters deal nowhere near 600 a pop and kill plenty fast.
---
good luck, no sure if I should say I hope it helps or not!
---
Tbh I didn’t even see secondary character. I’d say do something new and different.
---
Stop collecting all the stuff than and just go for a decent build.
---
I’ve learned to hate them now and try to avoid anywhere they normally spawn that I know of
---
I dunno I quite enjoyed yesterday's daily op even though my alt is a bloodied and the vast majority of the time I was getting shredded.
---
Eventually it became routine that we assigned a team member for clobbering duty whilst the rest of us fired at them like there was no tomorrow, we chipped in with the clobbering when we could with the butts if our rifles inbetween giving the robots a running around
---
Easy way to please everyone, make it a toggle option or new game mode so those who don’t want to be fighting high levels 24/7 can still enjoy themselves instead of shoving everyone in a box.
---
Lol anytime
---
I'm not seething about it. Y'all solo types are the ones bitching about one wasteland meaning it hard to solo a multiplayer game. I'm having a blast in the current game, literally everything has been improved for me.
---
I gain exp way faster than ever in the forest, and in the divide/bog, I'm tankier and equally as powerful as I was prior to the patch. The game has literally been improved in nearly every aspect for me.
---
And my only guns are anti armour.
---
Like, right now?
---
This update is likely only harder for people running the so called "food builds" and non legendary gear.
---
Theres nothing wrong with optimizing a little more, this is a good opportunity to do it.
---
There was an exploit that allowed to stack the strength buff. They disabled it while they fixed it.
---
ya rly, stop trying to turn every game into wolfenstein, todd!
---
I assume you are intending to max out the card eventually. By default it adds 1 to both Special and Stats. Level 2 adds 2 to both.
---
If you add the level 2 Luck Legendary Card, you will be able to move 2 Luck points away into Endurance.
---
I am as well, but what is the point of you saying this?
---
Hey good enough for me lol thanks for the reply
---
Perhaps they should go back to playing a non multiplayer game, since this is a multiplayer game and they don't want to play a multiplayer game?
---
Critters can't be legendary anymore
---
Geez young men are so eager! 🤣
---
Let’s get fucking swole bro
---
Can I get my weapons to break less often?
---
If a one shot goes to a four shot, the wasteland will run out of springs
---
Thanks for the info appreciate the reply
---
You know as much as I do that wouldn't work. There's no pleasing everyone. someone would complain about something.
---
There is one problem though with these, and that it's exacerbating the legendary scrip problem as it's yet another source of legendary stuff. We really need the limit to either go up or go away completely.
---
Tell unarmed players the nerf was slight.
---
Please?
---
Exactly! It’s our time to shine!
---
But, if you buy repair kits to keep your shit in tip top shape and save those resources for crafting a fuckton of bullets for &lt;insert heavy gun here &gt; you'll be fine
---
Well that’s the same concept really, he’s saying Bethesda changed something, and hasn’t done anything to accommodate people that already invested their time in what was previously a good build. Now they feel like they got ripped and stuck with an obsolete build and get stuck having to pick up the prices and grind a bunch of levels to change points and perks.
---
I see my brethren here amidst comments, God Bless America, And God Bless the Enclave.
---
I was a Full health stealth rifleman before the update and I am still the same build just with slightly different perks, legendary perks and weapons.
---
 I am not one shotting everything anymore(well my IE harpoon with Flachette mod still can) but usually around 2/3 bullets and everything is dying. 
---
 I dug around my stash for weapons I saved over the last couple years and found a couple beauties that work great with the update.
---
 Even soloed the ops today under 8 minutes.
---
 Rifleman is still viable in my opinion.
---
No one kept telling you that. They misunderstood because your post was vague and then you got upset. 
---
Use the resource I gave you and chill out.
---
Need that beefcake 3000
---
The horns were on the side of the head? around the sideburn area? I’m on Xbox and have one on a mule, you can have it if you want it
---
I used an unarmed instigating build for awhile with little chems, seemed to be overkill. Only would switch to executioners on tougher enemies.
---
Alternatively, you could actually read the website and find out that you can pay $12/month, and stop at any time.
---
All fallout 4 dlc enemies are super tanky in this game because they're just copy-pasted from fo4, where they had to be over the top tanky because they were dlc enemies. It's fine on things like anglers or crickets because they are meant to be tough, but then you see wolves and rad-rats surviving more than an equally leveled super mutant overlord and start asking some questions
---
Yeah it was very fun
---
I usually don't either but with limited game time and say too many different grinds I liked tanking everything. It allowed me to do more with less time. Plus I didn't have to farm for ammo much. Now 🤷. I'm going to give it a couple of weeks of playing but if it's as bad as it seems now I'm probably moving on.
---
AND MY AXE
---
Haha I'd love to know what they were thinking when they put that in. It was an interesting challenge but how can they justify melting it with a gun to 1hp then nothing unless you bash or melee it.
---
Someone definitely spiked Bethesda's drinks the day they thought this one up.
---
As an atheist, god bless the Enclave because screw communism.
---
yes.  im so far away from recommending this title to friends (and lord knows ive tried in the past haha)
---
Reddit users: “Why can’t we just get more free stuff?”
---
Bethesda: “Because, no”
---
Wait so the survival legacies are now craftable and non tradeable? 
---
I already hate this update...
---
I like having cover fire when i rambo into herds of enemies. You dont ?
---
People went bloodied knowing it was overpowered others didn’t knowing it was,and would be balanced nerfed in future. It has been balanced those expecting bloodied to be still overpowered are now crying that it has been balanced so it is no longer one shot lol spec.
---
I'm on ps4 unfortunately :( thanks alot though for the gesture!
---
I was using a two shot Tesla which did more damage than my bloodied for whatever reason, I didn’t have ffr on it though. But I was in the same boats you before wastelanders sort of, using the meat hook, but once they took away the double dipping of one handed/unarmed it wasn’t worth it.
---
That’s still massively overpriced for what you get in return, I just don’t see much benefit to having it and I play this game quite a lot
---
From my experience, even a level 50 me handy seems to only be slightly tankier then the level 8s. Personally it seems like the levels of enemies and their defenses aren’t scaled properly with their higher levels.
---
I've had an issue before the patch where the skybox was purple and untextured. But Im on PC so it might be related to hardware.
---
Me or the original poster?
---
Rifleman and gunslinger need base buffs badly. At least 20% to be playable.
---
I would say Daily ops need to give 1 perk coin per run guaranteed as well as 1 per rank earned in that one run.
---
That would give a few extra perk coins only once a day since ranks are limited daily. As well as another incentive to try to get elder beside runing the ops themselves to begin with, for those who initially werent bothered to. 
---
So you can potentially leave with 4 coins in single run.
---
I did it under 8 minutes too, pretty easy, good rewards.
---
I think Pokémon was funny like that, you traded from a friend who gave you a level 100 at the beginning of the game. But the game figured that and the higher level wouldn’t always listen to you when you used them. For fallout, sometimes the item jams or breaks easier, but you get the power now.
---
Yes. For this. I give them the credit they deserve. Well done!
---
No problem, vendor hop for a little while and I bet you’ll find one. Shouldn’t be more than 5K. At least that’s what I remember them going for if they were trying to sell
---
Player vendors obviously
---
I get that, I'm just surprised that it happened that fast when a bunch of other bugs have been going on for a long while.
---
But it depends, I know that they did release an antler headpiece last year or so? And a white fur coat.
---
If you meant horns, it’s probably the imposter sheep squatch outfit from the Encryptid event
---
Lmao
---
Because some people will complain about nerfs and such just because their broken ass builds don't work no more.
---
Yep. Suicide exploding dogos was a nice touch for up close chaos.
---
My perfect min/max unyielding SS bloodied fixer set is still smacking everything instantly. Maybe takes 2 bullets instead of 1 now to kill but with my 25% increated fr on my fixer I can't ever shoot 1 shot anyways lol. I also have 870k .45 rounds, I use the 2 SS 80% ammo wr and the point of strength for the 40%.
---
Very easy to kill.  I killed one in one bash attack.
---
I liked how fast pace it was tbh
---
I wish we could have regular and elite difficulty ops though. This one was cool and all, but my first solo attempt on a level 33 alt was 7:47. And my main weapons broke/ran out of ammo so I didn't even have that going for me
---
Only whisper in the dark is from survival from these two, the gutter was part of the taxidermy quest, as I recall.
---
Just the whistle in the dark, as for now
---
This is blatant complaining without playing.
---
Accompanied by a 30 min stage presentation by Todd, not less :D
---
Seriously though I think they go way hard on the minimalist UI design
---
If no one is within range of your emotes, there's not really any point.
---
Have you tried storing it and replacing it? My ammo maker stays locked. I leave the collectron unlocked for whoever wants the scrap
---
All Fallout games from 3 onward have enemies scaling to the players level. Why should this one not? It should more so than the rest because its a MMO. Its ever expanding. Do you prefer to be level 500 and getting 8xp from a weak feral ghoul? Or 125xp from a level 50 ghoul in the forest? 
---
This update was much needed to the game. And it's a goddamn crying shame that it got released 5months after Wastelanders.
---
I was sick of doing the leader of the pack event and getting a lvl 25 or 15 legendary after sneezing on a wolf
---
Hey everyone
---
I found the guy that reminded the teacher she forgot to assign homework!
---
I'm not using vats and it doesn't work on Earl or the queen.
---
As if their target audience has shifted, maybe they think they’ll make more money this way. Maybe they’re right?
---
Was it in the PTS? If so it’ll be around soonish
---
I had this happen a month or so ago, couldn't lock either of them.
---
Then I randomly tried last week, and hey, I could lock them again!
---
I'm guessing it's some stupid bug, try using a different level lock, or server hopping.
---
I can taste the salt in my mouth from reading this post
---
Ah the gutter was from the burrows quest, you got it for clearing the quest one time.
---
If Fallout 5 is ever released we probably will for 4-5 months.
---
Are you on pc?
---
It’s no different than creating the PVP servers they had a while back. If they can have level 15 and level 150 in whitesprings together taking out the same enemies at different levels a toggle option would work just fine.
---
Well yes, and no. If they didn't all flock like sheep and copy the same build as everyone else this probably wouldn't have happened. Theyve brought it on themselves and those of us who do something original benefit from it, I haven't lost any damage output that I've noticed, if anything the "stronger" enemies are dying quicker than ever.
---
Melee was hit the hardest with the change from multiplication to addition in terms of buffs. So much stuff added melee damage and that’s why it got nerfed so hard.
---
If it can be disabled server side without a client update, it's really not taking much of anyone's time.
---
Now, see how long before it gets *fixed*, that will be more telling.
---
Thirty rounds and a missile turret to take down one molerat. Level 50. I am almost always running low on ammo anyway, so it sounds like fun.
---
I have to admit - as much as I was upset about yesterday DO, today the DO was quite fun even with half-arsed build. I switched my stealth sniper with 1 END to commando and switched sneak perks for Adrenaline and GunFu. Then I grabbed a random explosive handmade from my stash and went bananas. Finished in 11:30, but it costed me 700 ammo, because I didn't loot the bodies and thought that I'll have time to loot them in the end...
---
It was broken to our benefit, but no one could keep their mouth shut so now we lost that
---
No idea, I'm on console
---
From what Bethesda has said they completely changed how legendary effects work and stuff so instead of things being "x3 more damage" it's more like "Plus 40 damage". From what I can gather they wanted to do this so they can tweak and buff certain things in a way that's not only easier development wise but more balanced for the player. 
---
Long story short
---
"We nerfed everything so it would all start at the same general spot but we will buff and nerf things as we develop the game "
---
Ive actually enjoyed the update, having enemies scale to you means more XP (which means theres no need to compete over white springs or westek) and the loot is also scaled... I run a FE LMG and enemies die at the same rate, damage on pip boy is still at 93 (same as it was before the nerf) so dont quite get what everyone is complaining about.  
---
Ive only noticed the nerf when I switch to my Instigating death claw gauntlet and the blood eagles and scorched take two hits instead of one
---
OK, thanks for that 👍
---
One Wasteland should have been an option we could turn on and off.
---
I really don’t understand what they were doing with this. The Gutter had(s) the potential to be a melee-style Fixer. Whistle in the dark is literally just a preset 3star legendary effect, and not even a good one.
---
Why?!?!?
---
Easily obtainable? Not really...
---
What legendaries are you talking about anyways?
---
Demo expert got a buff with explosive weapons?
---
That's the real question.
---
I'm confused.. My main uses a Anti-Armor Grognaks Axe and a Vampires Fire Axe. I can 2-3 shot everything before and after the update (excluding Scorchbeast).
---
Instigating and furious are working just as good, if not better than ever for me. Don't tell the sheep that though.
---
A lot of people asked for more difficulty and to make older areas more interesting to visit.  This delivered
---
The fact this was ever possible is crazy to me. I think they went overboard in the original game design that allowed for way too many overlapping multiplicative bonuses that they did not anticipate.
---
Sneak attacks seem to have been separated from legendary effects, and I’m guessing they only multiply off base weapon damage and possibly perks.
---
I’d love to see the code changes to the calculations.
---
Old math seemed to calculate all modifiers, then multiply that by 2.5-3.75 for the final result.  It’s a huge difference.
---
A lot of damage perks/effects seem to be debatably effective now.  The gap between my hyper min/max bloody rifleman and my casual buddy who just uses whatever half decent hunting rifle he can find while playing a few hours a week is now surprisingly small.
---
It feels like I wasted a tremendous amount of time farming and trading my way to the top of rifleman or commando DPS, when I could have just fucked off and be in roughly the same place now.
---
I second what Yiphix said. Lunchboxes. This is a secondary character, and with rep not ground out for either side, these are probably one of the better choices. Grab a couple dozen, form an Ops team, pop a few for your party and do a couple runs. Have fun with it.
---
While I understand your intent , I don't think a level 7 carrying an endgame grade weapon would be a good idea. Due to them being unable to produce enough ammo, and their armor not being suited for events such as ACP and SBQ fights. Perk loadouts wouldn't be optimized either. I know with One Wasteland enemies will be scaled, but there will  be obvious 'you really need to work on your equipment's vibe. Plus unless you're doing a guardian angel and keeping close to the noob, after their 5th death some people will ignore the call for help.
---
well TBH my saving grace is a Camp with a lead-node :D 
---
otherwise NO chance. the smart-drop in the daily challenge is absoloutely grea tho and should be everywhere. (drops the ammo i use against the enemy, great idea, my aim is good enough to barely eat through ammo if i get to loot the enemy  :D )
---
My once trust non-legendary 50 cal is at its limit :D i mean im lucky i play a heavy gunner PA build (non blloody) im fine prettymuch no matter what the game throws at me, and i like it that way.
---
The only downside is that glowsight got a serious nerf because  mainly farmed in the blacksomething mine enxt to whitespring and mobs used to die in 3-4 bullets but i guess its fine to me, after a bit of adapting :)
---
im also only lvl 103, how far UP do the mobs stack now in levels?
---
You are just greedy man.
---
Seems legit.  Vampire Unarmed could be pretty badass.
---
I expected to get hit hard but not this hard. Very sad.
---
Im not looking forward to trying the update on my lvl 25 pistol/shot gunner, as I was struggling with lvl 20 scorched, I do have a anti armor pistol which might help and a piece of magic armor (bashing damage) that's meant to buff shot gun damage I think after watching an angry turtle video. So I might be able to level to 50 in the forrest by taking workshops now that everything scales, however know my luck I've got the wrong piece
---
Crazy to think that I actually read your comment with interest because you're actually providing the information that I'd like to see... Unlike some people (-:
---
I encourage you to farm the forest for exp and nukes and Earle for ammo. Also, consider getting more than just one weapon type.
---
I personally use multiple types.
---
Handmade- 5.56
---
Level action/combat rifle- .45
---
Plasma flamer(for some reason it works with rifleman, not commando)- plasma
---
Combat rifle- .38
---
Tesla- fusion cell
---
Guass- 2mm
---
I swap between those as I gain more of their ammo, and start to drain my current too much. And will swap my receiver to .38 for low end content, haven't tried it out with the new patch. I haven't made ammo for anything but a daily for since prior to level 50, and use the hell out of the converter. Once a week, I turn in all my shotgun, missiles, 40mm, arrows, etc, and end up with over 3k 5.56 and use my handmade for like 3 days straight.
---
I don't have the glitched ammo factory, and haven't even started earning the ammo maker from the raiders yet.
---
That guy of course
---
I agree
---
Xbox One
---
The healing factor mutation was the biggest issue for me (possibly interacting with bloodied build). I got the bug many times per session until I lost that mutation. Now I get it maybe once a week.
---
If you stack ammo Smith with ammo factory you’ll be swimming in ammunition
---
Ok down to 8:42. Sooo close
---
Oh that’s right!
---
But it’s ok for someone with a fixer in ACP to stay stealthed in the back of the arena and deal 200+ damage with each shot? I can barely even break 1k now with a sneak attack using a bloodied power fist.
---
me too - really like the update .
---
I like the patch. It was needed. Now they just need to balance damage. They also should adjust the difficulty for people under level 100. Things were already pretty balanced for under 50, even under 100. Resource management was a big part of the early game and it was good. Then they went and changed it. That said, people over 100 needed something harder. The end game is pretty good now imo.
---
Replying to your post so this is visible:
---
Initiate has a 5% chance of a rare item.
---
Knight has a 10% chance.
---
Elder has an 80% chance.
---
Completing your first Op on Elder gives you all 3 chances to get an item. So you’re likely to get one, very lucky to get 2, and incredibly lucky you get 3 items.
---
Weapon/armor degradation is increased during daily ops
---
Bethesdrones in the comments &gt; [https://i.imgur.com/Uud0UPi.png](https://i.imgur.com/Uud0UPi.png)
---
Then you deserved my upvote
---
I don't really think so, just because the update has hardly made a difference to anyone that isn't actively levelling. The game is still ez pz.

It works for me I have abestos marine chest and that was still working when I fought ACP.
---
Cosign!
---
Yup, pretty handy melee weapon too. It’s pretty much an assaultron blade with the powerful legendary effect from Fallout 4. (Or whatever it was called... Did more damage and caused bleeding I think.)
---
I've noticed L100 enemies seem to be hit &amp; miss with regards the damage you deal compared to the lower level/pre-patch equivalents. Against many i'm getting reduced but still semi decent damage, but oddly the L100 Behemoth at Solomon pond has basically erased my Instigating effect (4k vs L95 before, now its 700 at L100 - 80% nerf. ).
---
Usually do it from third person mode so that I can swing the camera around and look for the trigger of the other devices.
---
I'm a little sad we don't get the board like we did during the legendary run
---
lvl 642 when patch 22 went live
---
scrapped cards + the bonus 50 = total of 1140 coins....... 660 shy of maxing all 6 legendary perks
---
a full complete respec should have been ( or should be ) available to those who play one toon but change builds occasionally
---
Play around with them and try things out, don't do what everyone else does or they'll just nerf you again. Do whatever makes you happy, but just a warning before everyone starts crying when it happens, which no doubt it will.
---
Yea, 11est, tried to get my dailies in before they expired, ended up only doing that and an event, time ran out on me as i was placing my last floor decoration
---
Only had one point of fireproof. No sense and shared team medic. Never had problems
---
I believe they’re fairly effective on humanoids... Blood eagles, Raiders, and settlers I would think  fall under that category. From what I understood, anything that can handle all the radiation like super mutants or ghouls...ur wasting ammo
---
Sniper rifles got destroyed with the new calculations.  An auto laser rifle is almost certainly better than a hunting rifle now.
---
I guess I’m talking late game, queen and earl type enemies
---
I have no idea if that's true but it's still a sh*t ton of ammo.
---
That sounds like a rough grind.
---
It's fun to see all the different names for these high levels which never showed up before.
---
 It's just sad to kill a "scorched  annihilator"  and get five 38 bullets and a pipe pistol.
---
Yeah but for this instance, it’s a preset 1 Star. So 👎.
---
contextual ammo drops for everything would be great. but it's never happening.
---
Players who do that are usually those who are used to play alone i think.
---
Max caps wait a second how much is that?
---
Also another hint to add to this: corpses disappear, but they leave paper bags behind with their loot. There is no real downside to rushing through for that elder time and then going back to loot, it may be harder to see but you can still get most of it
---
If I could upvote twice...
---
You have a few minutes to loot at the end as long as you dont open the operation report
---
Or any sneak attacks.
---
I noticed mine was empty, someone had obviously taken advantage of it having become unlocked after the patch. It did relock but only on the second attempt...odd.
---
I was going to enable that grenade drop perk.
---
O heard a bunch if the mods were having issues on pc.  That wouldn't bother the graphic on xb1.  I haven't heard alot of graphic issues mabye file a ticket.
---
Exploit with it. Turned off for now
---
I got two rare plans from one...on the PTS :/ right now I just got a liquid courage recipe both days, sold the spare one because wtf am i gonna do with that
---
oof this is super disappointing to hear, especially considering the game is now at a point where keeping new players coming in is incredibly important. Sure, the usual base of players is there and will be there for the long haul, but two years into the game you have to make sure you're doing things to keep new players staying on board...and it sounds like Bethesda has done the complete opposite.
---
I'm picturing Randall from Recess
---
No i mean if the extra points are actually worth it if you're getting hit a lot anyway 10% v. 20% might not be that much more significant. But then agn, if you have the coins and dedicate a slot to it, I suppose eventually you could max it. Just trying to be conservative rn since I'm only lvl 192 and had 350 coins from the start. I was saying to the other commenter that it would seem like bumping points into it would be like bumping up super duper. Still works rank 1 good enough. Idk something I'll end up looking more into as time goes on.
---
Then agn, not running full health. I have some weird junkies bloodied unyielding autostim non-pa, vamp magic, emergency protocols, nerd rage pa thing going on at half health, but somehow it works. How much have you tested what's rads cuz I was reading it wasn't as good as it might seem too
---
Sorry me posting ruined your day. Also someone had already replied so the post didn't require your dipshit response.
---
Oh nooo.
---
I know all I can say is Wowwwy wow wow woowwwwww
---
I can't believe the power.  I went from 13 damage to 16.
---
Look out im gonna kill you mean super mutants in 7 or 800 shots
---
If youre on pc I can supply with you any 5.56 I get, I collect them but I dont need them, its purely for selling them to other people. My stock is currently low since one guy bought all that I had tho
---
It's doable solo but really tight, i managed to get a 7:39 elder rank today with melee and a furious minigun for the boss. Its much easier than yesterday for sure.
---
20 springs from a single kill? Hell yeah. And those mutants better start dropping like 50 caps per kill
---
Yeah I do have decent armor but not everyone wants a Gatling or big guns! My shottie is a good one! But I just like the pew pew weapons! Got a 3 star fixer a couple of days ago but yet to be sold on it! Love the anti armor lever actions but not great now! Am sad!
---
Compared to 10k?  Yes, it is.
---
Oh no, my free auto aim misses some times! What's next Bethesda? Make me use my hand to aim???
---
And I love it, except I have to disable it every single day because the SCORE wants me to play nuclear winter and nuclear winter won't boot with it enabled.
---
(Actually don't disable it every day, I stopped using it)
---
Would feel really bad taking this over other options IMO. Nothing really useful comes from hacking or picking locks past a certain point. I'd rather use the legendary slot to boost defense or dmg.
---
the worst two options \^
---
The thing is, radroaches aren't supposed to be like squirrels and beavers. Radroaches and the ants that were mentioned are supposed to be *monsters*. I'm a bit surprised to see the ants presented as something as small as is being shown, because in the past they've been presented as being much larger relative in size to the player.
---
Man that was simple thanks for the quick Response didn’t realize there was an exploit related to it
---
I’ve never felt happier to be a New Yorker.  My download was done in 5-10 minutes.
---
I can’t imagine the lag while playing with those speeds.  It must be punishing.
---
Very well rested? Kindred spirit/lover's embrace. 🤓
---
Will do! Frustrated by it all. Appreciate your response!
---
They also made the glowing super mutant hounds stop dropping glowing meat at West Tek, so yeah. Glowing meat was one of my main ways of making caps.
---
You need to log a real support ticket
---
We Reddit plebs can’t help you here
---
I've got plenty of ammo for now. But it's everything else that goes along with it. Stims, regular junk to fix my guns. My camp getting attacked by high level enemies where I was in a very peaceful place before the update. Occasionally  level 5 ghouls would attack. Now level 100 super mutants. So far I'm not a fan.
---
the thing is that you inevitable level up and have better build, weapons.
---
a high level can't handicap himself to lv15 so you can have a fair battle vs a low level wolf. almost 2 fking years like this
---
sneak is broken in daily ops or in general?
---
The joke was thought to be that the person calling someone a dumbass used the wrong your meaning they themselves are dumb. It makes the note less funny once corrected, which is why OP is annoyed at the change. OP thinks it ruined the original joke even though it might not have been intended as such by Bethesda.
---
I wish it would show the actual circle like when you claim workshops.
---
This is brilliant. Makes perfect sense. Nice work with this!
---
Did it finally let you in? Or are you actually banned
---
Whistle is bullshit. I had one from survival back in the day. 
---
Gutter is actually good, it has the highest 2h dmg and looks cool, plus once you get the plan you can roll
---
It for legendary, not mad about it at all
---
Gamma gun has this base damage and then adds radiation on top of that. So you do good amount of damage no matter the rad resist
---
I have an asbestos chest piece and it does seem to be working as fire damage is mitigated, but I'm not convinced it's as effective as it was. Haven't gone in depth though as I've added the Fireproof perk for Daily Ops and obviously the two overlap.
---
Compared to way less than 1k. I used to hit SBQ for over 10k now I hit her for around 500 with sneak attacks. That’s BS and pathetic damage compared to what people are doing with commando builds. 1k is what I hit for on normal enemies like a super mutant after the nerf. Full bloodied unyielding and can’t even one shot a mutant with a sneak attack using the most powerful melee weapon in the game. I gotta stack food buffs to do it.
---
its literally sunkissed.
---
In general all over the game. My sneak melee is constantly detected, my sneak commando/rifleman is undetected thanks to range but cannot perform sneak criticals at all, manual aim or VATS!
---
But Beth needs you to login daily and grind that levels in order to respec, because it's fun and engaging content. Don't you see it? /s
---
Rip. They could’ve just added another one with free states loot, but they really had to do Wallace like that. F.
---
Sneak attacks in VATS are currently broken, I'm sure they'll fix it but I legitimately can't proc a sneak attack in VATS. 
---
Works fine with ADS but one of my toons is literally a Bloodied Rifleman Sneak/VATS/Crit Min-maxed character who is now redundant because of it.
---
I'm not usually big on youtube, but [Angry Turtle](https://youtu.be/AHu4CErJXU4) does a pretty good job of showing VATS damage with a non-legendary shotgun
---
They could always go back to the modable and popular 3/4 and NV. Since solo players have such an issue with no more and multiplayer.
---
Very well rested is the lunchbox bonus and lover's embrace is another name for the rested bonus. (The only difference is that lover's embrace is applied when you're around your companion in your camp)  
---
It's definitely worth testing to see if the rested bonus and the lover's embrace bonus can be applied at the same time though
---
It states on the perk card it caps at 15.
---
Yes I keep trying to get those on weapons. I want to use gauss mini gun furious and instigating for gauss shot gun. Anti armour is what I’m using on gauss shotgun currently and will be testing out anti armour on my gauss mini gun once I get more ammo built up but should still shred the crap out of things.
---
I don't know why but the 2 stealth snipers I ran with today would no do objectives and continued to die. I got some pretty rude messages about me not coming to help them.
---
Doesn't it cost like 1 perk coin to swap cards? Try it out for yourself
---
Uranium fever and especially radiation rumble is very satisfying as all about level 50 enemies. I think the ghouls max out at lvl 60, but it’s nice to be able to get a crazy amount of exp from them. I could solo the event before and now I rarely have one or two survivors alive by the end.
---
It's funny because the commandos are complaining about damage too.
---
In 4 at least it animated you crushing them under foot in the kill cam.
---
To compensate out of vats, two shot explosive weapons or high rate of fire explosive weapons or even a junkies explosive shotty (lots of rubberbanding hp tho), maybe even furious, antiarmor explosive for that matter... Relative to the damage recalculation, demo expert is very relevant now, considering it used to be way more op in the heyday
---
It is, at least for the dailies and daily ops. If you log in an do everything else that is on a timer you alredy have what you want.
---
I know it might not solve all issues, but today's daily op is incredibly easy to grind and im getting like 600 ultracite fusion cells per run, saving me a ton of flux!
---
May be a good way apart from mass producing ammo with steel/lead/what have you
---
Shoot robots in the Arms and Legs.
---
It's Protections and Mr Gusties in the Arms
---
Assaultrons in the Legs then head.
---
Sentry bots just wait for them to overcharge, then shoot their Fusion core in their back as it's opened up to vent.
---
BrainBots in the head.
---
This honestly should have been the first job of the game developers after they decided to port fo4 code into a multiplayer game.
---
What part are you at and level?
---
Who said I was talking about you?
---
Or...hear me out on this...just stand near the damn uplink! It’s not that hard.
---
You do realize you can craft like 900 ultracite 50 cals with a single craft? You don't have to farm for mats no more just fire away
---
Just use ammosmith and ammo facotry +230% ammo produced
---
Well rested, pardon. You get rested from a sleeping bag, well rested from a proper bed.
---
I have the symptomatic
---
If you ever run radiation rumble, I'd keep it around instead of scrapping.
---
It took me a couple hours to adjust.  It gets better...well after the technical issues get straitened out for you.  Have a good night amigo!
---
I cant really help you because i maxed it out before i began using it - so yeah i cant compare the practical value of one lvl versus another.
---
I did saw a video ( angry turtle) about "what rads" being disappointing . But i always liked sun kissed and the perspective of not having to carry radaways was to great to ignore . 
---
So i invested max - and has being running with it since update . This include Radiation rumble and nuke zones and from now it is a must pick for my full health builds ( i have bloodied builds too).   I really like it .
---
At least for sneak attack melee.  You should be able to knife someone in the back for full damage.
---
This comment right here is what everyone needs to not only read, but *comprehend*. This is only asking the billionaires how the economy is doing.
---
No
---
Sorry for the delayed response. Pictures below.
---
[Tank Helmet on Player](https://i.imgur.com/tPumKNS.jpg)

[Tank Helmet - Inspect Screen](https://i.imgur.com/EwU7bo0.jpg)
---
Yeah that is funny because their “nerf” is pretty much non-existent once you max follow through. They obviously don’t have an unarmed build.
---
Sorry man, it’s not just you. If you don’t have a killer build with the perfect weapon for it, this is the game now.
---
I think you might be exaggerating that stimpak part.
---
Level 30 and currently attempting all that glitters
---
No.. really?.. freggin balls... the best place to farm glowing/hound meat... i guess huntersvill now
---
The guy in foundation had 3 in stock \[lunchboxes\] for 100 gold each, unsure of reset timer assume it would be daily/20hours.
---
True, I'm aware of that also. That's one of those things you wouldnt exactly anticipate. Guess the moral here is if you are doing high caps trades, remove your good shit from your vendor and put a 1* furious rolling pin at 30k. The more the merrier
---
Not overly excited by the majority of the LegPerks as I don't use PA often and my standard SS armour already boosts many resistances. In any case its free to add the base card and only costs 1 to remove, hardly expensive considering the massive increase in utility.
---
I'm still grinding max rep with the settlers. So I dropped my survival tent by the overseerers house. I'm close enuff that FT is free from tent to house. 
---
Now the only trip I pay for is the one to actually get whatever Ward the Blind has let wander away from foundation that day. 
---
"Maybe a few more patrols over there..."
---
Maybe post a fucking gaurd on your bone saws, ya knob!
---
Making one for season 2?
---
Vault 88 was one of my favorite parts of FO4. I built a nice big vault complete with gardens, cafeteria, living quarters, medbay/clinic, gym/rec room, marketplace, workshop, and overseers office overlooking everything. It took a lot of time and patience (things not snapping properly) and I love the way it turned out, but if I had to do it again it would be a chore for sure.
---
Oh hey look it's this post again
---
Take workshops with copper lock them. do the defend events.  Then Do other things for a hour or half. Go back collect copper repeat profit.
---
Man I hope so. The ops requiring teams sucks too because I mostly solo, but I could get used to all that eventually whether I like it or not
---
Are you still getting disconnected?
---
Yeah I must of glanced over that portion, but I'm def glad they have addressed the issues with it. Thanks for the knowledge bro 👍🏼
---
As one of those " lvl200+ players who are deeply committed to a good build" I don't enjoy it.
---
I can still stealth-commando cheese everything.  There's no extra challenge.  Except now it takes longer, and I'm constantly stressed that I'm wasting too much ammunition.
---
The one exception is the daily ops.  That's not fun either, but yesterday was a "challenge" for a bloodied commando build.  In that you die constantly.
---
No worries at all! I just tested it out. Well rested, rested, and lover's embrace/kindred spirit all give a 5% bonus, but last for different periods of time. (Rested is an hour, well rested is 2, and lover's embrace is 3) Unfortunately, despite them being uniquely named effects, they cannot be applied simultaneously.
---
Ain’t that one of the final main quests? I’d recommend getting some better gear before taking it on.
---
Yeah the perk is pretty amazing.
---
Working on it, same document, look at the tabs!
---
Ammo and material is more important to noobs now, the enemies staying lvl with newer players is tougher since they cant technically grind weak enemies. It is better to give them supplies now, or provide actual support for them by joining their team.
---
I think it's good that they are catering more to the high level dedicated fanbase rather then casuals who weren't that interested to start with.
---
It’s a once a day chance
---
If I can be of any help, swap out at least some QoL perks for extra damage or defense.  
---
When I do Earle fights or whatever, I’ll remove Traveling Pharmacy for Lock and Load to cut down on reload time.  It doesn’t matter if I’m encumbered during the fight, and I can just put Traveling Pharmacy back on when I get kicked out.  The same is true for Daily Ops.
---
I don’t carry enough crap to slow to a crawl when all hoarding perks are removed, so I can still function.  Your results may vary.  No one needs 200 stims for any reason, so it might be worth making some donations to low level orphans if that’s the case.
---
I wasnt talking about any benefits but the nature of the game being not like your casual raid game where you group up to do something; some do sure but its not a general thing I played since launch without a signifcant  break and I have seen a group of players like 3-4 times at best.
---
Ah yes, the sounds of suffering and depression are glorious. The complaining and sadness are like the bells that toll and call out to me. I honestly lovethis update, makes it lore of a challenge and if you cant deal with that cus ur dulb bloodied build or melee build was nerfed, then simply rearrange your perk cards, try something new, it's all about working with what you got! Now come on. Stop feeling mad at Bethesda and just go with the flow, yeah it seems like shit now but come on. If you hate it so much then you're on your own. If you wanna try something new like me then have a heart and have some fun!
---
I enjoyed it today.
---
Even soloed it once.
---
Yesterday's op was pure sloppy dog crap.
---
lol you just are bad are you xbox because i can 1v1 you and win and my build is shit
---
Pretty much, today’s Op made me want to do it several times. Yesterday’s I made it for the first tier and didn’t go back. I ran today’s Op 7 (6 under 8min) times and didn’t get a single rare drop though, kinda lame
---
I'm considering doing the same. About how many atoms did you have to spend?
---
Oh, I guess not everyone chose a safe area for home. I chose a cliff near atlas since way before wastelanders, and it works great. No enemies, lots of traffic for my store, and a middle of the map fast travel.
---
And I have yet to figure out how people never have stim packs. I have over 690 regular, and 200 supers. I can't get rid of the things. I have a before I keep a stack of 20 in for 1 cap each and still get more than I use/give away.
---
And junk is easy if you do a few exploration of areas. Just pick up junk. I do stuff like west tek, son of dane compound, and sugar grove once a day, and I have a hundred of most junk, 250 of rare(ballistic fiber, springs, screws, etc) and end up with tons of extra to sell.
---
With Str at 15 any Leg Perks will add to Str but won't open any new slots. The bench is available early in the season run but is currently suspended in use as its bugged.
---
Im loving this update
---
Awww nice. I literally just found a post on xbox for someone wanting to place it for free, but I dont mind paying you for it if ya know.
---
thanks for sharing I think I need to work on mine but its hard if you cant decide which weapon you run as a main
---
Geez! Yeah you'll NEVER run out of ammo for at least 6 months to a year. Just wow 😮 2k Ultracite Plasma Cores, now that's crazy.
---
Really? I am primarily a 2 handed melee build as well. I have a Grognak's Axe that has faster swing speed, more damage each hit and I forget the third and I am still doing the same damage as before.
---
I feel literally no change at all. Now I also have a Lever Action Rifle that's explosive, double damage of target is at full health and I forget the third. I was only able to use that on lower level enemies anyway and once again don't feel much change.
---
I also have a Gatling Gun that is explosive and either has double damage or more damage after each hit and a third I have no idea what. Since One Wasteland I feel like I am doing MORE damage with this specific weapon.
---
I don't know, I love this update. I truly feel like a tank now.
---
Yeah exactly what this guy says my friend didn’t do it till level 70ish and I didn’t do it till 90 odds because I was enjoying doing both side of wastelanders
---
Sweet look forward to it, last one was helpful.
---
The legendary perks will not push your base stat past 15. If you’re already at 15, you’re better off adding it to another stat. 
---
You can move points from Strength to a different stat as normal, and the perk starts at +1, then ranks up to +2, +3 and then +5. So you could do this over time as well.
---
The Weight Bench is an early reward in the new season, at rank 4 IIRC.
---
Awesome. This is a good mini guide for the XP grind we're looking at now. I have 5 of the perks to rank 3 already, last is still rank 1.
---
I think I have a Brain aneurysm from reading that.
---
That is the dream. I have almost 400 waters at all times and every pre war food I can find, despite just eating raw meat with carnivore. 
---
In retrospect, he is supposed to be my hoarding character, but still. I miss my power armour
---
I'm currently accepting donations of yellowcake flux to make even more.  I've already used like 15.  Help me, I'm scared
---
you can increase your strength past 15 with a strength legendary perk card but it will be a waste since 15 is max for amount of regular perk cards you can have.
---
Happy to help! Good luck!
---
As far as I understand it, you can from 15 to 20 for the stats. But the ammount of perk cards you can use can't get above 15.
---
Are you on xbox
---
I have given it two days and called it quits since it was no longer fun.  After loading into the prison and being at 20% health before the loading screen was done I said fuck this. Rage uninstalled and figured time to find a new game to play.  Good luck out there.
---
The big problem with energy weapon is how the damage is calculated with anti-armor legendary effect and perks. Ballistic weapons adds all damage effects first to base damage then calculates the armor piercing effect, energy weapons the armor piercing calculates off base damage then adds all other damage effects.
---
Early in the season? What's a season?
---
Yea I am completely out of the loop on this one, just redownloading the game.
---
Or consentrated fire then crit to shoot the core whenever you want!
---
The only way Bethesda ever notices stuff is if everyone says it loudly, over and over again.  So yes.  This post again.
---
How do they not anticipate people stacking melee bonuses when they literally made it that way. Simple, you should only be able to have 1 bonus from food, 1 from alcohol, etc. Just like the guy 100 yds away and everyone else in the game, or give everyone 10 different additive food bonuses.
---
I've played this game every single day for almost a year.
---
This update has me looking for a new game to play.
---
Good job bethesda.  I'm just glad this update came out before my fo1st subscription renewed.
---
Thanks for ruining the game
---
Yes.  To look at a little different, if your STR was 12 and you had the +5 STR legendary perk,  you’d get 3 more perk points available for STR, and for things like melee damage and carry weight, your STR would be 17.  
---
The bench press is currently deactivated, but it’s a season reward.  Once you have it and use it, it gives you +2 STR for 30 minutes.  It acts like any other STR buff from chems or booze.
---
It's 80% chance for each op at Elder level , but you can only receive one plan per day so if you win one you it will be 0% for each subsequent op until the daily reset.
---
Hoarder much? 😃 You can honestly supply a small army with that amount of Plasma Cores.
---
So one person says it adds to the stat, other says it doesn't.
---
Anywhere specific you got that info from? I'll empasise that I do not care for the perk points for the time being, just the stat.
---
Ah ok thanks for the heads up
---
Yea sorry I misread the above as respawn since both involve clicking the map. Sucks that the fast travel still exists. Seems like this is high on most people's list, so fingers crossed this is next!
---
The “recommended” start level of the quest line is 25 which you need to reach before progressing  further in that quest line so you’ve went in woefully underprepared considering it’s actually meant to be post game content which you need to be 50 before attempting
---
No, you don’t get anything past 15. The legendary perks don’t give you a higher maximum. It simply lets you ‘replace’ normal points. 
---
Side note, it doesn’t work on Charisma to allow higher rank cards to be shared. That will go off your base SPECIAL, and not factor in any Legendary Charisma.
---
Edit:  Perhaps I’m wrong. If so, my apologies.
---
I might give some away.  I'm on pc
---
From the [Patch Notes](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5cRE8qhGB6BrOuJBnPhNGO/fallout-76-update-22-patch-notes-september-15-2020).
---
Edit: Actually it’s not in there. Maybe it was an ITV.
---
Maybe I’m totally wrong. If so, my apologies.
---
The respawn glitch seems to have changed, the encrypted pylon debuff now persists after event completion till you close down the game!
---
Definitely not melee. Melee builds are going to be relegated to daily ops with the resilient mod.
---
It’s really supposed to heal you?  I’m having a hard time believing that BGS would give us anything that nice.  You can do silo runs with absolutely no worries now.
---
Allright, perfect, that means I can get it for the +5 Strength I want, and, seeing what this subreddit turned into, probably need.
---
No idea what the season thingy is tho.
---
I'm giving up on this game also.  I got it about a month ago (so glad I only paid $10) and I'm level 39.  Most enemies used to be trouble-free, and I figured I need to level up more before attacking some of the bosses.
---
Well, no more.  Every creature is now a challenge.  Nothing is below level 30.  I just tried taking out a level 39 assaultron, and it would just automatically heal itself despite being bombarded with bullets and grenades.  I never got it below half health.
---
I'm done.  If Bethesda fixes this, then I'll be back.  I'm tired of working so hard for so little gain.
---
“A level 20 ghoul isn’t any harder than a level 5 ghoul, it just takes more bullets.”
---
Damn if that ain’t it. Take the first Reddit award I’ve ever gave.
---
I was talking about this with some of my mates, we convinced a couple of our friends to get into FO and started a new character to play along with them, and even though I’m dropping ammo and meds off from my other characters it’s a massive struggle. I feel like this update hurt the lower players harder than anyone, I think they should have rolled out the LV match system first and then reworked the nerfs. 
---
Now you need a full dmg build to make it feel like your doing anything, and then you miss out on quality of life perks like carry weight perks and such. I think max nerf should have been 30% to tone it down a little and to level out dmg with the new legend perks. Instead of going balls deep with up to 70-80% nerfs
---
If you have maxed said special stat already, you won't get additional perk points for the same special but say you have 9 STR points standard then have +1 STR from the legendary perk cards you'll get to use another STR perk card.
---
Does that make sense?
---
The legendary run gives you the plans for the bench press
---
Try using melee vats which has been unreliable for a very very long time
---
I can't proc sneak attacks out of vats either....
---
Have you played much after this update? I only ask because now everywhere I go everything is level 50+. Wes Tec was full of level 100 super mutants. I'm using 3x the amount of ammo I used too. And my camp is right by R&amp;G station. I picked it because there were no set spawns. I got attacked maybe once a,week. I've been attacked every time I load in now. I also have a good amount of junk but it's not infinite. Whitesprings is great for junk too. But now it's full of level 75+ ghouls.
---
I have a heavy gun Vampires build and yeah apart from using a bit more ammo, I'm having a blast. Did the daily op against the resilient Gutsy's solo in 11 minutes without dying just to see if I  could. If you are finding it harder now, I recommend you watch a few videos on what perks/ weapons and armour you need, to make it work for you. It  might take shuffling points around for a bit, but hey it will be worth it.
---
lol totally agreed, nobody with a sober mind can come up with a ‘challenge’ like this 😂
---
That is a good workaround. It’s annoying to spend level ups to transfer specials late game, but I think that works.
---
Edit: Actually, the annoying part is having to level up, e.g, 5 more times. There’s really no perk cards I need late game.
---
I think I got mental retardation from reading your post
---
I feel your pain, dude. I'm level 190 but I'm definitely more of a casual player overall, and don't have a good "build" to speak of. More of a jack-of-all-trades but leaning solo commando build. Unfortunately, my best weapon is a bloodied handmade but I'm not a bloodied build so it's only so useful. I don't have god-tier weapons and armor. I do have 1 alt character but I literally only use that character to hold onto the few semi-okay legendary items that I DO have, and otherwise it's just scrip weapons. My stash of "semi-okay" legendaries, however, will not get me my "dream" weapon that is more suited for my playstyle, so I make due with what I have in hopes of scoring a nice loot drop at some point, or maybe getting blessed by the purveyor one day.
---
All that said...my play yesterday, attempting to do my dailies, was grueling to say the least, and not very enjoyable. This, coming from a player who has played since beta and dealt with the half-assed game that was originally released. Through all of the games ups and downs, I've never really complained much &amp; have, for the most part, enjoyed myself despite the many flaws. People can go search my reddit history of posts, etc, I've never made any rants or complaint posts. I feel like doing it now, though, BECAUSE of One Wasteland.
---
I'm gonna give the game a few more days to seenif I can force some enjoyment somehow, but have a feeling I may be looking into other games soon. Check this...since this game dropped Nov 2018, I have ONLY played this game, and 2 others. Days Gone for about 6 months, and Until Dawn for about 2 weeks. Right now, though...Cyberpunk is looking pretty awesome &amp; glad that it's coming out soon. It may replace F76 as my go-to game unless I miraculously land my dream weapon in the next few days (or before Cyberpunk comes out anyway).
---
Atleast you can refer to this when you break their TOS
---
BGS: PLAY HEAVY GUNNER W POWER ARMOR OR GO HOME.
---
&gt;Don’t have an interest in optimizing
---
Okay then, play old isometric Fallout games **without save/load and investment in any combat skill**. We'll see how long you will last against several wanamingos, fire geckos and Enclave soldiers.
---
&gt;Don’t have the time/resources to optimize
---
**Please, point out any Beth's promise to make 76 the casual-est game in the world**. If you wont spend your time to invest in a game, you wont be able to progress here.
---
&gt;Are experimenting with different builds
---
These players will indeed suffer, but: isn't this update truly shows any flaws in their builds? If they're experimenting, they should be ready to fail — **this is the basic rule of any experiment**.
---
&gt;Are still leveling and haven’t finalized their builds
---
These players wont feel anything, if they are good enough to watch on their health bar, weapon condition and ammo amount left. I'm leveling now and i don't care about my build or anything. I fight regular Scorched, protectrons and wolfs; i realize that **some enemies are meant to be tough on every level**, thus i'm not fast-traveling to Monongah mine or Glassed Cavern. Or even HOTS/LITS/FR. You know, understanding which monster can do what is essential when you are playing a game which requires you to kill foes.
---
&gt;Are on the road to optimization and don’t have the legendaries yet
---
That would be true, unless someone shows a different result... i also happen to have full stacked char without any legendaries i wanted. And i don't care about any enemy i encounter. No food, no meds, no magazines, no bobbleheads, **no buffs whatsoever**. I don't feel any struggle while i'm killing enemies, except the fact that some of them become my level and require 3-4 shots from my Plasma instead of 1-4 hits with Death Tambo.
---
&gt;Last night at the SBQ we had a group of 13 I think. At least 10 of the 13 were being massacred by the adds
---
Last night i had only one player constantly dying on SBQ in two nukes. Out of 12-15-something. Me myself was running around half-irradiated and still fighting off every enemy and SBQ itself. With a Gauss **Rifle**. Constantly missing. If non-skilled myopic player can do it, most of the players can. Because everyone in aforementioned fights were better than i am, judging by all the damage and constant killing of any minion that come too close.
---
&gt;you’ll find no shortage of players that are fighting tooth and nail to survive a few mole rats or ghouls
---
Yeah, most of them are Bloodied. Including you. What a disparity that you are talking about some casual non-skilled players but **most of the posts are from Bloodied boys and girls**.
---
&gt;Part of this issue is that there are no “unoptimized” enemies like there are players
---
Yes, only a part of them, that is true. Either they adapt, or leave, or Beth will roll back some of the recent changes.
---
&gt;You could easily have a level 60 player who is more powerful than a  level 100 player based on their build. You’ll never have a level 100  scorched that is weaker than a level 60 scorched. So, if you don’t/can’t  optimize your build immediately post-50, you will fall further and  further down on the power curve.
---
Again, i haven't seen Beth's promise (maybe these were words of Toddy in any interview? Maybe Terms of Agreement contains something i've missed out?) to make FallOut 76 casual. Besides, is that normal that this example of 60 lvl player will use Bloodied build in 95% of every case? No, it is not.
---
&gt;It’s like if we were playing baseball and you made the ball heavier and moved the fences back at the same time.
---
No, you haven't suffered that. You just said it. Now you're just exaggerating to make your words look soulful and pleaful.
---
**I haven't felt any nerf here**, albeit i'm not playing any meta cuck build. **I'm still spending same ammo for enemies of my level on every character**, hovewer every enemy is close to my level. **I'm still watching any Gauss Mini or Pistol or Shotgun or Explosive weapon ripping any enemy apart**, although they spend a little more time for hard enemies and SB.
---
P.S. All in all, there is an irony: i remember all these complains about 3D FallOuts being mindless shooters instead of "no-downsided" tactical fight in everloved FallOut 2.
---
Well now, there you go. Enjoy *true* wasteland all who've said that. Others... bear to it or wait for changes.
---
This is why they were asking for pts players to start from the beginning to test out the rebalance.
---
I didn't even notice any change. Running in my excavator PA an using my AP crank Gatling. Fun all day pom pom pom splat. Next!
---
My ghoul slay fixer is the best thing I got other than a ts handmade but I don’t have a auto for it. Before I was confident in running around with 200 ammo. Now? Hell no.
---
I mwan yes, that does, but the point is - I do not care for the perk points. I want an extra +5 Strength for everything that ISN'T the perk points.
---
Short answer no. Long answer you can’t steal 
---
Npcs power armour it will show up on ground when you kill them but the loot on them will be the non customised versions if they even drop power armour parts they even fixed the better version basic guns that the gangs used to drop.
---
Yeah, gamma gun is strong vs almost everything. My bloodied auto one does something like 400 ballistic. The reload speed is rough so it's bad for crowd control. The rad damage isn't going to do you much good because it's too strong otherwise to matter. It's nice for PVP though I suspect it's less useful now with all the SS armor out there.
---
Thanks for the clarification. I’ve got a vamp faster fire but I never use it
---
I got second tier solo...might need to grind alittle gear and change your build a touch....Lotta good advice gonna be on here the next couple weeks just gotta sort out the bs.
---
Yeah I am loving the update and I am having no problems. I don't even consider my build to be meta, and I am not what you'd call a min maxer.  I am a power armor/ heavy weapons build. Perks are 95 percent combat related, but a couple of carry weight perks for ammo and weapons.  And I do just fine.
---
yes 60% boost is great. im keeping mine.  im a full health pa
---
Im just a casual(?) rifleman build and i feel useless when swarmed as i do moderate damage but lose alotta hp
---
thats fine but I'm still not gonna walk from Watoga to say Vault 76. for fun. to each thier own i suppose.  I found the places etc by walking around and exploring months ago. I wanna kill stuff. walking in the forest for 10 mins admiring the trees and sunset. is not killing lol.
---
I don’t really run 1 or 2 handed, but I do run unarmed which relies on a lot of the same buffs for it (though may be at an advantage since I believe unarmed has a higher base damage to start with).  I’m not optimal by any means, and I have been doing Ok with it.  I’ve been using bobble heads to help top off my damage.  Enemies are taking a few more hits but I’m still surviving just fine.  I think you’ll be ok, it might just take a little adaption, maybe even taking a look at different weapon types (e.g. now that Fire damage is actually a type, I’m going to look into what actually has fire resistance and see if the shishkebab maybe more effective when enemies don’t have resistance.
---
Hack and slash is the only melee card even worth considering so yes. 
---
If you want proof, watch one of Angry Turtle's videos on legendary perks. He uses an deathclaw gauntlet for his melee testing.
---
It's not harder though.
---
Well, not unless you're running a bloodied stealth commando build in a public opp where everything can always see you, and can only be killed with melee.  
---
Most of the time, though, it's exactly as easy, it just takes more bullets.
---
You'll get the benefit of increasing your STR such as increased melee damage &amp; weight but at max standard stats you won't be able to use another perk card.
---
From my experience as of 10 hours ago.
---
They only notice stuff when it annoys their own staff.
---
Yup, my gt is Commissar#6088
---
With this perk maxed could I walk through a nuked zone and last more than 10 seconds??
---
I was thinking of getting the perk that makes rads heal you but not sure what's better or if i have the points for it.
---
Do you have both maxed? If so, have any tips for settler rep?
---
I guess I’m just one of those players that doesn’t wanna change my build, my build is mine, I don’t wanna be a cookie cutter type. I appreciate you responding to my whining, does me good to hear the pc players are having issues as well, maybe they can get it worked out. Thank you
---
did you try actually manually changing the core?
---
Ive raged over this so many times.  Zero audible notice and odd timeframes (some are quick to explode, others take a bit longer) Just big badaboom out of no where.  I full on avoid anything metal that Ive killed for at least 10 seconds now.
---
This is the best post I've seen since OW dropped. Thank you.
---
This is only a problem for low level players. For everyone else, it's really a nothing burger. Daily ops can leave you with a net gain. ACP can do the same. The Ammo Factory perk is a massive boost.
---
That's why this is a problem for low levelled characters - they don't get access to any of that.
---
But the guy 100yard away never dies.  A good bloodied melee build can die in one hit. And everyone can easily accomplish the build.
---
I’m lvl 101 have something similar to a sneak commando build even though I rarely sneak unless I’m bored and I use a non legendary handmade (because I can never get legendary ones) and I haven’t even downed or died since the update and I’m not saying this to try to disprove your complaint but what I do would be considered a bad build and a “unique” play style and I’m clueless as to how this works
---
I'm glad there's that aar timer. In a timed event I feel like I can't waste time looting mobs, even if they explode in my face, so I'm really happy they give us some time to run around and collect all that precious ammo
---
You should get the 'buffs' -increased melee &amp; weight
---
I did do west tek. It was full of 75-100 supers, but they went down the same way they did prior to the patch for me. In fact, the few that were 75 seemed to go down faster.
---
I don't know why you'd be attacked at a train station, that's very strange though.
---
And I only went through whitesprings once today. Lots of 75 ghouls, not much different from the old nest of 62s I used to fight. Went down just as easily. The 50 gangerous were easier than before the patch as well.
---
I will mention, now that I think of it, robots seemed more troublesome than before. At sugar grove, it did take more time and ammo than usual, at least it felt like it. And level 100 gutsy is way more dangerous than the old level 68s. But then again, gutsys have always been pretty dangerous for me.
---
This is a fantastic explanation of the current situation and I appreciate the time you took to not only write it up but to read through the responses and reply to most comments. 
---
I found myself post 22 still knocking scorchbeasts out of the sky, killing level 100 deathclaws in seven or eight shots and for the most part - even with a DPS nerf of about 25% - my life hasn’t changed much. My character build (armor, weapons, SPECIAL spread, mutations) is optimized for combat and my cards are about 80% optimized. Adjust my cards a bit and I’m back up to where I was.
---
My concern is echoed in many comments here and that’s the loss of the casual player; many of those are my friends and family. The truth is if my casual player wife starts not enjoying the game, she’s more likely to just not play anymore because no place is safe. She can’t just hang out at her camp on the fringe of the ash heap and deal with the occasional small scorched horde; they’re all level 50 and they’ll kill her now. She won’t optimize shit; she will just quit and go play Outer Worlds or watch a movie. And we are both grown ass adults who use our scant few hours after the kid goes to bed to relax. If she quits, chances are, I’m going to hang with her most evenings instead of wander the wasteland. 76 is something we’ve always done together; if the casual player can’t adapt, this game is going to die.
---
Same! I kept getting lost in yesterdays one and couldnt get elder. Today 3 of us got it done in 6 minutes and it was so much more fun
---
I see it in my build menu, but it tells me to look for the plans for it. Where? The settlement?
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
How else am I gonna get my cat meat?
---
My shotty is missing more than it hits now.   Like first three hits just miss.  After that it is a crapshoot.  I WILL eventually hit, but when?
---
You can scrap new perks, too
---
I’m guessing the War Glaive plan is like the Fixer, bear arm, etc?  You can craft a vanilla one and hope to roll a good legendary with RNG?
---
Yes, it seems to keep the core equiped to your character even out of PA. You can't manually put a core in or swap it out.
---
Best thing to do would be make everybody happy and make it a game mode. Best of both worlds.
---
I don’t see handmade/commandos complaining? I have that build and maybes it’s 1/2 more bullets to kill something over pre patch.
---
But melee is completely useless
---
Ah, my apologies, I have made an ass out of myself.
---
The original roll was Resilient Bots in v94. Someone bitched on reddit and they re-rolled it around 1pm est. It is not their normal reset time, it was a special re-roll done by devs.
---
Allrighty then, majority says that it gives you the +5 Str, but not the perk points, so, you know. Only one way to know for certain!
---
Soloing it is still pretty bad ass in my opinion. I'm not a fan of level 50 ticks, but otherwise I'm stoked.
---
Problem is its timed and to get the best reward you need to get a movin asap.
---
Usually takes a minute or so for others to join.
---
So if your first start going for the beacon things and hold out until backup arrives
---
maybe another frame? if that changes anything? idk, i run like 10 frames total on my character so if one goes down i go to another
---
Ehhh that's not quite right. You _can_ receive more than one plan per op but it's not common... and it's not entirely uncommon either.
---
There's a 5% chance you'll get an uncommon/rare plan on Initiate and an additional 10% chance you'll get one on Paladin and an 80% chance you'll get one on Elder. That means there's about an 8% chance or so that you could get two uncommon/rare plans and about a 1/2 of 1% chance you can get 3... provided you complete the op on elder tier of course.
---
Jesus christ I hate Bethesda fans now, you all praise the developer for doing their fucking job.
---
There is literally piles of scrip all round the rusty pick, but as you have already stated, you cannot take 'em
---
Um what does that mean?
---
I have a full collection of handmades and fixers, that pretty can’t notice a difference.
---
But melee does almost not damage to late game bosses, and def not worth the risk of dieing.
---
Also, my build took many hours of research and leveling to get to.
---
I have been trying that, so far four still don't work
---
You sound like you have a very unoptimized melee build which means you aren’t going to notice like people who run bloodied with full unyielding. It’s pretty obvious when your sheet damage goes from over 1k to less than 500.
---
So basically just choose any perk card (either a dupe of one you have or one you’re never going to use) when you level up and scrap it?
---
I think you misunderstood what he said. He said it's easier for him on the lv 12 character, not the lv 42 character. That's most definitely a balance issue.
---
Bethe$da wasn't trying to balance the gameplay, they were trying to balance towards making people have to buy repair and scrap kits. Watch some sort of auto-repair gimmick show up in the atom store in the next couple of weeks.
---
Same as last season.  Buncha crap but 2 or 3 things I want.
---
Yeah I can see it being rough on stealth. I'm bloodied but the opposite of stealth :D
---
I think you're loosing more and more braincells, from just simply being alive so please. calm down before something very "sad" happens.
---
Daily Ops with Resilient will usually be a hard pass for me.  If I have a melee buddy I’ll try it.  If not, I’ll just wait for the next one.
---
Anyone that did the quest 10+ times for the legendary masks, like my dumbass, probably knows this XD
---
I'll have to try this out, I've never really paid attention before. Now i'm curious to see how much a difference there is.
---
I agree. Im level 203, and my girlfriend who started playing about 2 months ago just hit 50. She was really enjoying it, but now she is going through ammo and repairs almost faster than I can keep up with. This wouldnt be so bad but a lot of the game is really hard for her, as someone who doesnt have a solid build or gear yet. She is barely scrapping by and enjoying it much less than before. We were both excited for the one wasteland, but they really need to tweak the damage and bullet sponginess of enemies a bit more. Hopefully future patches will fix this.
---
Well, I'm not the, you know, you typical Bloodied PvPenis, it just happened that my goal for the character - getting most strength possible - is basically 2\3 of a Bloodied build anyways. 
---
I was running with the Gutter most of the time anyways, so I dunno. Hopefully with the new update getting my +1 Str weapon that doesn't suck will be easier.
---
I’m probably middle of the road with my builds.  Not “kill SBQ in 10 seconds” nor “Take all the Weight Reduction Perks”.  I’m finding I’m actually wanting to duck for cover now when I’m being fired upon (especially in the new OPs).  I started cracking into my stash of magazines, bobbleheads, actually using chems and booze, bothering to make sure my gear actually has the upgrades other than simply adding more carry weight.    Head shots are more important so I’m trying to work on my aim.  
---
I’m finding it a nice little boost in challenge, where before the only thing that did anything to me was assaultrons.
---
Literally my brother last night.
---
Commando is still really solid. If you use VATS (and you should), you're going to need some more Luck. :)
---
From my understanding this is correct.
---
I expect it to be a valuable plan for at least a little while.
---
400 atoms minimum when on sale even.
---
No thats dumb. Cat meat is in the game so its dumb to make any cat immune. Its pixels, get a real cat.
---
I was lucky my main is a vampire heavy.  So damage doesn't bother me.  Legendary perks allowed me to add 2 levels of adrenaline so it all worked out.
---
Melee is for resilient mod daily ops only now I guess *shrug*.
---
I’ve noticed it too I think it’s because all of the enemy’s are leveled up to match your level
---
This is an excellent summary.  I feel it to as I try to rebalance my junkie build.
---
I haven't tried my lvl 17 guy I just used to farm the +1 level points from LR.  I need to bust him out and see how bad it really is.  Considering I've had to up my ammo and remod my weapon for better durability due to the number if shots I have to put out now, I am not hopeful.
---
Not the only problem. The crashes were annoying too.
---
I feel like the issue is more the game isn't designed with it in mind which makes the travelling boring. The world is so lifeless that there is absolutely no point to travelling.
---
There is barely a real player economy or player hubs, they're no guild mechanics to allow larger groups of people to come together and maybe create player towns
---
Hell, there isn't even something basic like Guilds and the roleplay potential in that so people just fast travel because the world just really isn't that interesting.
---
I hate you bethesda you made enemies based on the players level.
---
It was definitely easier, but it wasn't the enemies that were challenging yesterday, for me it was just getting lost that was challenging, and that was no fun
---
Truth
---
Ah. Lvl 182 and I haven't noticed this. Just thought it was a cool little detail.
---
I'd say it would put the team together and then once you have all 4 people it would put you into the op
---
I really haven't noticed a difference, except i have more ammo, more stims, and more fun.
---
Someone wants to flex in front of Ward...
---
Burrows/Robots/Resilient is probably the hardest combo possible for Elder rank.  The rest are comparatively easy.
---
There’s going to be a new op every day, and the unique plan reward list is pretty short.  If you don’t like the combo of the day, just skip it.  There’s plenty of score points to allow you to skip ones you don’t like, so that shouldn’t be a concern.
---
Yes, but it’s only a preset 1 Star roll.
---
Yeah, you can scrap any perk, you get 2 coins per rank (star). I just scrapped any of the dupes and ones I wasn't going to use again. I recommend scrapping all your cards that have 1 rank that you wont use, that way if you get one in a perk pack it wont just disappear
---
Yeah I got to the last room a minute earlier than yesterday, but I also think it was partly the enemies. I probably finished them 30 seconds earlier because of not having to melee them
---
Wait....they bumped the levels up in low level areas instead of nerfing enemies in high level areas...so if I got to the forest with my level 170 things are going to kick my teeth in?
---
Stealth Commando is still pretty solid.  It's viable even with a low-tier weapon, and is pretty outstanding with a good one.  Basically it's just like Rifleman, except you put point into the Critical Savvy perk, and spam Criticals while you're shooting things.  I made the switch from Stealth Rifleman a while ago and never looked back.
---
The main difference now is that everything takes longer to kill, and you use up ammo faster.  Which is tedious and unfun, but not "hard" exactly.
---
With everybody exploding all over the place it was hard to loot. I had confetti mess on too :D but yeah, it was great for my dad build
---
When they were released it was plain as day that the game was going to go in a pay to win direction. The ball just started to roll downhill. Over the next year or so it'll pick up speed until you can only get 4 and 5 star legendaries from buying them with large amounts of atoms, and the only way to beat anything effectively is with said legendaries. This update isn't about gameplay balance, it's about balancing mote money into Bethe$da's pockets.
---
Yes, yes it was
---
agree 100% sometimes I dont get why I cant move and keep searching my inventory until I finally find those 6 mini nukes and 20 missiles I accidently picked up.
---
For pvp specifically of course, most players use stealthboys so hitting them can be a challenge it should definitely be a one shot one kill even as a bloodied it's not very hard to tank bloodied teslas especially with a cavalier set and auto stim and born survivor 1. The argument I see is everyone saying bloodied is too strong or "furious assassin's and AA is too weak buff them" I think that bloodied and junkies should remain the best of the best but as far as pvp goes the cap at 110 isn't too bad for commando but if sniper and shotguns are to be viable again the cap needs to be raised, you'd be really luck to kill a stealthboy tesla player with a sniper rifle like a lever or Gauss while they're slamming quantums, but if they're a bloodied build that doesn't know what they're doing hitting the damage cap would one shot them. Idk lol
---
Yeah but like a week or two ago... not like they could or would have implemented any changes in that time. Probably just said that to line up an excuse for pushing out more halfbaked changes.  I’ve seen plenty of pts players saying they reported issues
---
I agree that complaining for no reason isn't helpful, productive or even needed. 
---
But I also agree that complaining about genuine Glitches and bugs is acceptable. 
---
I for one am enjoying the update, The content, the optimisation (It's actually running pretty smooth), even the calculation change in damage.
---
What I am not enjoying is the fact that Sneak attacks in VATS no longer work.
---
That one needs a good fixer-upper.
---
I wouldn't say it's unoptimized. I just like having different options. I have all the necessary melee perks and I never bothered with chems and food to boost my stats, too much of an annoyance. It's not like I'm role-playing here where that kinda thing might be necessary.
---
As for bloodied, never was my thing.  I don't like seeing the red on my HP and AP bars. So I always went got a full health build and use PA to be a tank and now with the new legendary rad resist perk, I think radaway is going to be a thing of the past for me outside of nuke zones.
---
I 1 to 3 shot most things with my Grognak's Axe, a Scorchbeast on the other hand takes around 5 to 10 swings. Not too bad.
---
Oh sick, I can finally justify moving my camp
---
Fireproof 3 and they were causing ZERO damage. I felt sad for those Eagles using a flame thrower. Like, please, someone tell them I don't really need to kill them to do the mission. Just go away, go home to your family, for Christ sake.
---
Yeah, I’ve already scrapped all of the old, which is nice to not have that clutter. But I just realized how many more I would need to level up and scrap to change or upgrade the legendary perks. 😭😂
---
The fact that you CAN stack food buffs is precisely the problem. That needs to be removed. The fact that a ranged character might be better suited to kill a FLYING CREATURE is obviously lost on you as well.
---
That's because bugs taste gross. If you want to regen hunger, eat regular food...
---
Jesus... Already?
---
Yeah, I don't use them nearly as often as I should haha. That was what I just started specing up. Would you mind showing me an example of the commando build?
---
I don’t know what all the whining is about. Junkies ffr and vats concentrated fire head shots work just as well. I stood in one spot with my powered bos armor and had no trouble in the daily op. Never had to stimpack. 
---
Get your balls together and figure it out.
---
This is my build

Regrind everything?  No thanks
---
I changed weapons and perks for the robots, but the same setup was good against the Eagles. Can't complain. So easy it feels like cheating.

[my junkies shotgun build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=10567778&amp;d=sb0su1so2sd2sp2sg2pc2p01e80eh2es1c12cu2ce0ic4id0a72as2a00l71lt2lu2i10xj2xp3xl0x40x80&amp;m=cf7b&amp;wp=w9&amp;wm=1b2935&amp;ad=03458)
---
My build is a mess, I know, please don't laugh at me 😅 Anyway, my husband gave me my first junkies weapon when I was low level and being a full health junkies shotgunner helped me survived the wasteland for a long time.. I also lived inside my PA almost from the beginning starting with excavator to T51 then I grinded for a T65.. I know shotgun and PA is a bad match but I was doing fine since the update 😁 Currently, I don't have a problem with tanking and surviving, my problem now is my damage, I can still one shot most little enemies, (if they don't rubber band health) but yesterday, it crushed me when I tried rad rumble and got overwhelmed, glowing ghouls take 3-4 shots now 😪 I got anxiety and changing routine is stressing me out, so is it possible to stay inside my PA still? Also, weapons breaking almost always and fusion core burning fast is a bummer too.. I sincerely would like someone's output, but if my build is hopeless, it's ok, I'll try to just adapt 😅
---
Knowing how well Bethe$da has their finger on the pulse of the 76 community, it wouldn't surprise me if the enemies scaled in sponginess with groups as well.
---
You could stack the buff infinitely
---
And it just dawned on me that we need a Nuka drinking emote/pose.
---
Got me wiped out at the golf club last night.
---
Have you purposefully/accidentally aquired a Carnivore or Herbivore mutation recently?
---
I went in i made sure to follow the cave through properly instead of just jumping up and taking the shortcut and even then i had to wait like 5 or 10 min cus I walked away a bit upset becauwe it didnt work instantly and heard myself getting attacked.
---
All the smiling faces make me feel deeply uncomfortable..
---
maybe I am hollow inside...
---
I'm lvl 33 and just ate through 1400 rounds to clear out an area that normally took a quarter of that. 15 mins later I have no ammo and a sledgehammer that used to be good but now just blocks half the screen while getting lit up from basic enemy sponges. I haven't been everywhere on the map yet cause of other high lvl players enemies would destroy me. It's cool that now the levels will be even but if I can almost die to 2 random things that attack when I load in, I don't have the best feeling about living in those areas while traveling. Specially having a stock of hard earned ammo just melt away. That just hurts lol I'ma still play and enjoy it when I can but I'm feeling like I might be better off moving back in the vault.
---
"Murgle who looks just like my cat in real life" 
---
Let me bond with my cute bundle of pixels in peace
---
I mean stop collecting all the nukashine or whatever that's barely Increasing your damage and go sniper or whatever.  You don't have to get all those buffs
---
Its amazing:) I just wanted to expand on your PSA.
---
I was thinking back to the beta the other day and how much of a joke that was, it was marketing lol and the pts I think is only a joke partially because of the players as well, I don't see what everyone tests so I can't assume they test everything right or smaller details that are often overlooked or players are simply desensitized to. One small thing that I think sucks is I run 15 endurance on my main and it's supposed to let you sprint longer, most of the time my ap bar goes down slowly as it should but it's still not too uncommon for it to drain like my endurance isn't calculated correctly for the ap drain to sprint.
---
Well I'm an idiot and didn't realise I had mutated.
---
The nice thing is the Seasons give perk packs, too, with any luck they will implement 10 or 25 perk coins on the tracks later on. It takes a lot of point's unfortunately, I have 5 characters, from 310 to level 86 so I'm probably more fucked than most lol
---
I feel this. I won't care about builds and all. I only ever kill things for workshops or dailies. I just wanted to build camps, and just hang out in the forest. I have bought tons of atom shop stuff, but it doesn't really help when I get killed in my camp in the formerly safest areas.
---
Ppl enjoyed the game their way, sorry not everyone wants to be blasted by a fucking mk0 liberater pack while wielding endgame weapons and armor
---
That’s.... Pretty stupid.
---
🤡you dropped this
---
It's not the little creatures I'm worrying about, it's the end of event bosses of the primal cuts especially down in the bog. With a small timer and having to chase down the enemies the big guys at the end are gonna be tough to beat in time, no more soloing pretty much anything anymore.
---
When that happened to me, someone suggested dropping all cores then picking them back up. It worked for me. It may be hard to so that during ops tho. Oh no
---
May main had no issues with the update, vanguard explosive sneek, running fixers and handmades, but my alt, bloodied unyielding melee was totally turned to trash. Full health is the way to go now.
---
Bethesda said at some point they plan on giving out perk points as (for example) event rewards later on, if I remember correctly. But for now, scrapping cards and reaching lvl50 (which awards 50 points) are the only ways.
---
Stealth rifles got hammered. I would suggest stealth commando.
---
But Stable Flux is also a non-base crafted component that doesnt break down. Mechanically speaking Gunpowder is the same as scrap - or at least S Flux
---
Oh man, I totally forgot 🤦‍♂️
---
What you should all be asking yourselves is this:
---
If the people making core gameplay decisions about this game don't even play it... why am I still playing it?
---
ya its not a full blown pc mmo. but definitely more engaging than fps. i used to play cod/halo/gears all the time. Just got sick of the repetition.
---
Not near. If and when they feel we need it, there's the 4th and 5th star. Then after that it will probably be by blocks of 10, to give us lv 55 and 60 weapons.
---
Several steps and most likely long ways off
---
Ok keep playing what you want stealth sniper still works. Your special stats look to be going good. Read up on the perks and plan accordingly. What those complaining about stealth sniper now is one shot kill of high level enemies is no longer guaranteed. I have experienced this myself stealth does allow me now depending on how many and close they are to back away in stealth and not alert every damn enemy to my presence with a non silence shotgun with proper agility stealth perks. Also bloodied builds were hugely overpowered damage wise and survival wise despite being a low health build like 20% health was common. Now they are with new patch more glass cannons the damage doesn’t stack the same and the survival tools don’t work as well so they die more often and use more resources than they used to.
---
So try removing and adding the console again?
---
Ok, cool. At least there’ll be something else to come. Thanks.
---
I have a rule: I take only 200 shells with me to Daily Ops or Colossal Problem. CP makes me walk home with 500-600, but today's Daily Ops against the Eagles made me walk with over 1350. Insane. On average (I did it several times) I collect 800 shells each time, which means killing 30-40 enemies.
---
Furious on melee is unoptimized and it sounds like you aren’t running bloodied or even low health with adrenal. Do you have the melee mutation/s? How much were you hitting for before and now? I used to hit 10k+ with sneak attacks now it’s a little over 1k. I think we have different perspectives of what is good.
---
Yeah I checked and its definitely the herbivore mutation haha. Ty!
---
One wasteland is a HUGE misstep imo. Looks good on paper, but in practice makes it so I can’t even take a step out of the house without getting murdered by level 50 Mirelurks that I barely damage. Actually makes me want to play literally any other game because I want to enjoy myself and physically cannot. Just like SBMM in Modern Warfare. Good on paper, makes it so you can’t enjoy yourself when playing the game. I think we might need a revert here. One wasteland kills casual play. If Bethesda is truly committed to this, section it off like they did the old survival mode.
---
Good shit
---
I got one today.  I’ll have to compare a crafted glaive to a super sledge and sheepsquatch staff to see if the damage is better.
---
Fair. For a second i forgot this is run by Bethesda 😂
---
Before this new patch? Cause you can’t anymore lol
---
absolutely, the sneak VATS is the only killer on my build, otherwise I'm still skipping and whistling down the road
---
What a great idea! And then snipe them when they let their guard down.
---
I dunno man, you might have to do more testing, my first character was a quality of life build, had carry weight perks, and balanced attributes so I could use heavy guns, melee, and rifles, and I could use them all pretty well, now that build is absolute rubbish to the point I’ve just transferred everything to my bloodied character and deleted it lol. Now my bloodied build is doing around the dmg of my jack of all trades build but without and quality of life perks and no versatility.
---
It’s essentially forcing people to go all or nothing with specific weapon types.
---
Oh I love this! Definitely gotta make a blueprint of one of these guys tomorrow!
---
the interior of the bunker looks awful now, the new walls looks quickly scrapped together and half-done.
---
How good is it!!
---
Your life is now corn soup
---
Follow through instead of jumping, thank you. I got sick of spending 20 minutes using all my grenades on the mirelurk kings, started just jumping up at the first room. I'll try going through the normal way, and actually staying around for a good while. Really hope it works, thank you.
---
I used radaway until I lost healing factor, and it seems to have made the difference! Of course it was the last mutation I lost, but it will be so worth it
---
Make Shovels Great Again
---
I use the cardboard guy, but don't bother with the letters.
---
Quite a few items are broke for displays right now.
---
They're trying to make the type of game where you need to pay to win. Pay for FO1st and have unlimited scrap storage for repairing gear and manufacturing ammo. Pay for repair kits so you don't need to farm as much for gear repair so you can concentrate on farming for ammo and ammo materials, which will grind your gear down and make you need to buy more repair kits. And that's just at the base level of utility items currently available in the atom store. Wait till even more game-affecting items get sold in the atom store that was supposed to be for cosmetics only. Notice a trend here?
---
If you know there gamertag hold start, then go to the recent tab, find there name and view there profile, if there online and in a game you can join them.
---
That's no lady... D:
---
It's the main reason why I get bored of FPS unless I have friends to casually play it with, unfortunately my friends take it too seriously and ruin my interest in them pretty quickly.  
---
Last time I played Halo was with 4 and had my 22 year old friend shouting in my ear about what he claimed was some random bullshit and me dying too often (never claimed to be good at FPS) and I just went 'fuck this' and haven't really played a FPS since.  
---
Nothing against people who want to play it more seriously but that's just not what I want out of those games. I just want to play those games to kill shit and lower my stress levels.
---
Dont,people glitch into locked rooms with PA locking stuff just makes  it a challenge .
---
Sneak isn’t broken in daily ops they just gave the mobs such high perception that you are basically auto detected. For some reason they wanted to disable stealth in daily ops
---
My friend that I farmed a bit with came out with over 1k 40mm grenades lol
---
I have been trying for a reclaimed miner helmet from Earl. The last thing I haven't received from this and after many many successful fights I always leave empty handed. A friend I play with every day has had eight of them. RNG loves me too. Got a BE50 handmade from the sale so I think my luck is probably done for the year.
---
PC has a mod for this.
---
Ya it’s better than I thought it was gonna be. The same ppl bitching were the same ppl bitching before about bloodied and junkies builds doing too much damage. I was running around with a non- legendary DGC just to see what it was like and 3-4 hits isn’t terrible. Ppl just have to actually use perks and builds so they mad.
---
Try the robot vendor in watoga station there is a Brotherhood of Steel robot there who might have box mods. Other than that you can get modifications by scrapping other Gatling lasers
---
How can you expect to play a survival and combat game and focus soley on the opposite and expect it to be easy? It has nothing to do with hyper optimizing being required.
---
Yes, definitely. While I have no confirmation on this, damage from them may also vary, since the resistance doesn’t change.
---
Under no circumstances am I even getting near a level 100 Yao Gui, much less attempting to kill one.
---
Yeah, so far I'm really liking the higher level enemies and the daily ops a lot. That Burrows one yesterday was 10x better than the actual Burrows quest thing was. Today I was excited to jump on the Ops and it didn't disappoint.
---
Maybe I've just been lucky, too, but I've found a ton more legendaries the past two days than I'm used to on private. That's always fun, and now almost every drop is max level! That's awesome.
---
I could do without the legendary run. No big deal, but I have a feeling I will stop chasing that soon. It'll likely get completed anyway, passively.
---
Seems to be working
---
That's how MMOs *should* work. You hit a max level and then a DLC comes out and you have to start working for gear and weapons again. Then the enemies aren't such a big deal until the next DLC when everything gets harder again.
---
It's not
---
They nerfed all damage
---
Can you guess which idiot didn't buy anything from the sale?🤭🤫😅
---
If your only pulling 300-400 dmg my pistols dealing 800s and my 2* non explosive flamer deals 300
---
I run a stealth bloodied commando. Craft some diluted stims with chemist and super duper. Throw on born survivor replace sneak with dodgy and eat drink something with ap regen. I used my medics fixer and ran today's op 6 times with one death.
---
Seems like it’s an incomplete balancing attempt, there’s like a ton of damage, hp, xp tweak needed to be done. 
---
One wasteland is good, it’s just the damage done to enemies hp scaling in lower levels and some weapon builds are stupidly designed and ignored.
---
plink at protectrons they have an odd hit box between the torso and legs that deals crit damage when shot.
---
Can't you drain their fusion cores?
---
You don't use "Gunsmith", do you?
---
Yep I'm sure that helped me today too. I think the only people without this perk are the ones that still don't know about its side-effect.
---
Weren't the bosses already pre-leveled? I did plenty of primal cuts events solo, the only thing that seemed to change was the number of creatures spawning. And with the final wave only requiring the boss to kill, you no longer have to hunt everything down unless you want to. 
---
And if the instanced smaller mobs take longer for the big boys to kill, then the smaller people in the event have a better chance to tag xp on mobs.
---
No matter how you look at it, meat week seems to have gotten an all around buff.
---
I've only had this issue when using a gatling laser that also used fusion cores and I found that switching weapons resolved it for me.
---
They disabled it. You could get +2 str for every use maxing out at 100 strength.
---
no regular mobs are easy I think its just ur build
---
No if you can talk to her with no problem ie she talks back just wait a day. When you place the console sometimes it takes time until the next quest step actually triggers if she moves to the console and uses it you’ll just have to wait. Look at her level if it’s 65 she hasn’t reset for next step of quest she should be 36 or so. It can take over 24 hrs for her to trigger next step if you have just replaced another companions item. Just wait and make sure she is walking around and using console is all you can do. Make sure console is on open ground and not surrounded by other items like workbenches for example
---
Maxing out the legendary perk will give you 5 points in that special. So a max level legendary luck would allow you to move 5 points into endurance and keep your luck at 15. Did that with luck already, plan on doing that with agility and perception and putting points into endurance and str.
---
They found a bug that gave more strength than intended so they disabled it till they fix it.
---
Yikes.
---
ya way to many sweaties in PvP. especially Gears. wall bang shotgun for days. Unless you played everyday. You'd get wrecked. I have alot more fun when I'm dominating. getting killed every 5 seconds makes for a pretty frustrating dull experience.
---
I know. I know. But I can’t help myself. Opening locked containers has been drilled into my head since 1986.
---
They definitely hit the nail on the head with this major update opposed to other updates.
---
In terms of how the game is functionally and the overall feel for a survival genre. 
---
The one thing that comes to mind for me is the song used for the trailer of the game and it’s first line, West Virginia. 
---
“Almost heaven” 
---
They’re ever so close to having the polished product everyone sought when the game first released. 
---
A little fine tuning, some bug fixes in the coding, maybe a couple of small value changes and then we’re finally here.
---
“country roads, take me home, to the place, I belong!”
---
I’m intrigued, excited and ready for action in Fallout 76.
---
Me too. Figured now is a good time as any to give Nuclear Winter a try. I'm not good at it but at least I can get lots of perk card packs from it.
---
Lucky, 2 of the best possible plans. I couldn’t solo it yesterday so teamed up and got a shitty stash box skin, today I soloed it easily and got no rare rewards.
---
Personally I'd drop the Concentrated Fire, get a higher adrenaline perk, maybe glow sights.
---
Biggest thing with shotguns right now is to try and get a "magic" one. 
---
I'd suggest PA if you're comfortable with it, but if you get ANY armor with the "15% less damage while blocking" stat, it's magic. and it will make any shotgun absolutely murder in VATS.
---
Also, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs&amp;ab\_channel=AngryTurtle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs&amp;ab_channel=AngryTurtle) , watch this and skip to about 2:10 to see about shotguns. This should help you tons regardless of if you want to switch your perks around.
---
Unless I am mistaken, aren't flamers pure fire damage? Although on the flip side, you don't need the flamers at all, any blood eagle with a laser weapon heals you way more than enough. I run 4* Electric Absorbtion.
---
There is no knight rank
---
I’m just glad Uranium Fever is dropping leveled legendaries.  Overall I do kinda wish the Forest mobs were easier to kill, but whatever, not gonna complain about it.
---
I actually do like the boosts to perception and enemy damage.  Before I felt like stealth-commando was basically playing on easy mode.
---
But I don't like how every little radroach now takes three shots to kill with a bloodied  explosive handmade at nerd-rage threshold.
---
Give me more free shit. Lol🤦
---
Since they have buffed the enemies their entire stats have increased- health points, damage, damage resist etc
---
But I feel ya, my bloodied DCG was doing 2,400 damage pre patch now I'd be lucky to deal 600 damage
---
I'm A rifle build (with some personalized modifications) it is harder than before in some way, i noticed that i get hurt/rediated more, i use more stimps now, and it take me a couple more bullets to cause the same damage i used to do, but I'm used to be in high level areas and I'm pretty much always in a team, so is not so bad (so far) but i haven't been in the forest making worshops alone yet, that will be a waste of bullets now for sure
---
It's that sneak attacks are broken and haven't worked since the update!
---
Dont worry, melee vats is still broken after several years so I'm sure they will jump right on it.
---
The biggest problem for me is the effort vs reward dilemma. I have to expend more effort and materials to take down enemies, yet thier shitty rewards are the same. The only improvement is max legendaries (most of which are shit because they did nothing to balance the effects and the RNG is shit) and more XP. That is it. To make this worth it to me and probably many others, they need to change the loot tables to make it worth it for me to kill lvl 50 eye bots and lvl 50 molerats. If they change it and make the effort vs reward better then it would be a slam dunk for me. But they haven’t.
---
I... just did.  Oh, no.  It was a radroach
---
Im part of the actual 2% that listens to other people boast about their build kicking ass and then hearing you talk to yourself saying that your dealing 300 pre nerf when mine did like 14k+ dmg without additional chem buffs or those people that boast about literally anything and your dealing 1000 more dmg than them and then they start flexing and then i strait up kick you from the party cause its annoying
---
Yes but the power armour for npcs isn’t a seperate item so they won’t get out.
---
Be on a public team and use voice chat?
---
My bloodied PA heavy gunner build still feels pretty damn strong as well. This patch seemed to make the game harder for all the non-meta builds, which seems the opposite of what they wanted to achieve.
---
Glow sight works for Earle too (The Wendigos).  It’s a godsend if you can share it too.
---
If all enemies drop contextual ammo then I’d be ok
---
shit meme
---
Some one claimed my workshop today and I tried to take them out but the 1st 15 or so rounds didnt register  no vats.we just played hide and seek for 5 mins till he fast traveled..I could see how pulling out a explosive weapon would help on that front.
---
Radats were already OP for their level.  The rule of thumb with them is level plus 5, Crickets are almost as bad.
---
Now they are both little bastard tanks that get in too close to see way to effing fast.
---
 Need to sell those repair kits in the atom shop.
---
Not the person you asked, but some tips:  
---
* when you do the foundation quest, hand it in with the “donate to foundation” option. 
---
* find settlers out in the wilds, you can donate materials to them and this gives some settler rep.  
---
Edit: * do the photo quest for Davenport and choose Crater, but go sell the photos to Ward in Foundation. If your Charisma is high enough you can lie to Davenport about it and get a reward from him too.
---
literally cancelled my first membership after day 1 of update because of this, and i am a lifelong fan of fallout since before fo 1 and 2
---
Now you're thinking like Bethesda!
---
I thought so too, but they were definitely proccing Electric Absorption for me.
---
Only reason I say it is cuz they proc it about 10x more than the laser weapons.
---
So. Is your .50cal faster fire rate? Weapons that fire faster in public servers sometimes tend to "rubber band" an enemy's health bar. You can also see this with shotguns, an enemy health bar appears to empty, usually ending in an enemy death, BUT, with the rubber banding, health is restored. 
---
Now you mention SBQ, and her dying quickly. There are "magic" weapons. Effects on the weapons like, limb damage, +33% vats accuracy, and bashing damage. Combine that with automatic, faster firing weapons and you'll see the "magic" take effect and enemy health bars deplete very quickly. Best weapons for this are miniguns, light machine guns. Gauss minigun is capable of this as well. 
---
Hope this is what you meant.
---
Works just fine for me, rank 4. Just tested for another comment/post a littlw while ago.
---
Using AA 10mm pistol, lvl 75 glowing mole miner:
---
- 74 damage torso shot first hit 
---
- 117 all the fallow up shots to the torso
---
Sneak attacks work just fine for me aswell. Inbeleive their damage is being figured off weapons base damage now.
---
Im a vats/crit exclusive handghn build aswell. Sneak all the time.
---
Ghoul Slayer Explosive Fixer.  Not the best. But more than what’s needed. When I ran it today i forgot to have my Explosive Expert perks on. And I still finished in 16 minutes.
---
Also (not online to give specifics) but google commando vats sneak build and you will get some good suggestions. 
---
Basically, vats, hold crit down and shoot.
---
I’m still processing how I feel about it.
---
Currently I loathe Daily Ops. My terrible-ass build isn’t doing well solo for sure. I have completed 2 for 2, but both took 45 minutes or so. Part of this was likely due to having to bash/melee to kill, though.
---
As for finding level 75 snallygasters north of Grafton. I dunno man. That’s pretty brutal. A true shock to the system. But... Appalachia was probably getting a bit too cozy as I’m just over level 200.
---
hell no
---
I havent used any leg perks yet but follow through was on my top 3.hope it works
---
Gunna dust off my pistol guy and see how tank killer helps. He wasn't stacking any funky bonuses, just a furious ffr 10mm, and he always did very noticeable dmg, it just chewed through ammo like a beast.
---
I thought this was confirmed to not be the case.
---
It's not too much of a hassle to respec from rifleman to commando either, because they're both in perception
---
Yeah s/o to angry turt. I feel like it's lowkey dracula when he speaks, gotta luv it. For radiation I guess I'm okay running ghoulish in pa and carrying tons of meds with traveling pharm, but I hear ya on the nod to sunkissed.
---
Meh, the game is actually slightly harder now, enemies just hit harder
---
Wrong kind of train 😉
---
Ty, I’ll check it out
---
She's level 26 for me.
---
The animals are higher level, but are harder to keep alive vs tougher enemies.  
---
Estimating, I’d say the Free Range Brahmin are 20% tougher, but the wolves, bugs, bear and sheepsquatch are 40-200% beefier.  If a legendary stingwing spawns, much more likely now with higher levels, and poisons a Brahmin, that cow is dead.  They may have a higher level and a few more HP, but their resistances seem to be roughly the same as before.
---
Friendly Fire and a shishkebab is much more important now, in every event with friendlies.  Radiation Rumble can fail in less than a minute now if you don’t actively protect and heal the four humans.
---
A lvl 100 deathclaw in Project Paradise is pretty durable, but again legendary poison will smoke it quickly.  1st or 2nd tier friendlies are very hard to preserve, especially in the aquatic biome.
---
I’d expect perfect event victories to be the exception rather than the rule from here on out.  More players might be willing to step up and do more than shoot, but I’m not holding my breath.
---
Love the idea im already a 3 star then technically
---
FYI today’s Op mutation is not the melee one. Instead enemies explode when they die. So if you have fireproof and dense chest, it’s pretty chill.
---
All at once
---
Must be naked and 😨
---
Do the PA glitch and you can join Murmur on the other side. There you will see ALL the scrip.
---
Well you have to actually claim it while it is in the shop. I only say this because from how you worded it, it doesn't seem like you know this.
---
Let them try to stop me! Building penis everywhere, starting right now.
---
I believe the ranger armor was a monthly free item. It happened to be available when I signed up, which would have been in July.
---
Had nearly 2k lead. Been saving it up since before Wastelanders. Used it to make shotgun shells yesterday. All gone today. 10/10 update, definitely not unfun and unplayable.
---
Dropping them did work, but it happened again once the core ran out of energy
---
It should work on lmg too
---
I was very disappointed that the level 50 protesting scorched in Grafton do not drop level 50 protest signs.
---
I want a high polish chrome paint for the T51b. Add a red tactical light and BOOM - old school Cylon
---
Yeah I'm struggling. I was grinding out lower level stuff to build up my character. now I'm getting hammered. I'm only level 25 I don't know how I'm going to complete these missions now. I'm trying to recover this part for rose and can't get to it because a deathclaw is posted up in front of it. I tried sniping it but it heals quicker than I can do any real damage. Up close I tried using my shotgun but I'm dead in 3 hits.
---
There is also a lot of fun in just trying different builds before late game. I was melee, rifles, explosives, now am heavy weapons. Early levels you frankly use anything you have to win, forget always using that shiney rifle with X ammo. Also, those who have issues with ammo, daily ops have replaced my ammo farming completely. You get more rewards in every sense doing ops then hitting up lucky for lead.
---
I think this patch has made this game actually playable, not ruined it.
---
I am partially happy with Ops. I am primarily a non-bloodied stealth rifleman who enjoys patiently sniping targets. Clearly that isn't possible with Ops, but I am also used to being a second class citizen to commandos.
---
Ops are actually fun for me though, even without commando perks, I alternate between my plasma flamer, furious explosive railway rifle, and my explosive vampire 10mm submachine gun. Railway and plasma take rifleman perks, smg doesnt. But I can still chew through enemies easily enough, and my x-01 power armor mitigates enough damage that a regular stim pack sustains me for a good amount of time, only needing to switch to the smg as back up sustain, or when the flamer breaks. I haven't even messed around with my perks replacing my stealth ones for ops. Once I get around to putting dodgy and the like in there, I will be golden. And if I can get my hands on a vampire's plasma... yum.
---
Oh, and I still clock in at around 8:30-9:00 solo on ops I am unfamiliar with. Once I get a feel for the layouts and optimize a bit, I will probably be able to reliably nail elder rank solo. The Resilient mutation is kind of a pain because it slows you down, but you really don't need to kill a lot of enemies until the pre-boss fight. Rest of the time it's just crowd control.
---
Happy cake icon.
---
A different suggestion of the same vein: If you have Overseer tickets in NW, let us convert those to perk coins. I’ve got well over 500, and since they’re insistent in us using the mode, might as well make use of the ‘currency’.
---
hey i appreciate the kind offer! on xbox though. youre a good dude.
---
I feel the exact same
---
Dang took a small break from the game and missed out
---
I can appreciate your frustration.   I have a lvl 235 tank build and it's been fine with the patch.  Although, its because the magic DB I use still deals a lot of damage, any of the rifles and punching melees I formally used are now useless.   It also has full SS armour so it can withstand a fight.   My lvl 78 rifle build character with combat armour has taken a beating.  Enemies take 4 to 5 times the ammo to kill and   she is dying every couple of minutes.   I had 85 HP left and one mongrel took a bite and killed her, it's pathetic.  I used to always participate in Scorched Earth with her but since the patch I've yet to finish it as I can't survive for longer than a couple of hits from enemies and the ammo to kill things is outrageous.  You're also right about items breaking down.   I don't have F01 and have already run out of material to repair weapons, armour and create ammo.   I don't have any storage space left so the best I can do is risk losing items by transferring between characters to repair or gift ammo.   Or, I start dumping some really nice rifles I've been storing.  Sucks because I loved the rifle build a lot much more than the tank, now I  don't know if I can ever play the character again.
---
It got to the point that I had to melee that insane assaultron with my Mistress of Mystery sword because it was all I had left.
---
Hopefully they raise the bar somehow..adding another star wouldnt be enough.just my 2 cents.if I have a beast of a fixer why bother going for one with an additional perk on it.higher level gear would definitely get me back out grinding .its almost 2 years so I would hope they raise the level soon.would we even have a stable player base in 2 years?
---
I don't mind the change. I thought it would make it harder for me as a mainly solo player but when I got in yesterday I was still one shot killing near every mob I came across. Same as before. I seen a guy outside West Tek lv 238 unloading full clips from his gat plasma and still not getting the kill. I felt bad cus I was on my lv 81 rifle build with an instigating lever action clearing the entire outside before he could drop a single mob. After talking with him he was hitting for 4-8 damage per shot. No perk cards for heavy gunner. Complete food build and had 0 damage cards. No wonder your struggling. So I showed em the ways of the force and by the end of our time together he was mowing mobs down like they were lv 1 ghouls. Some people just don't know the benefits of only carrying 50 stimpacks instead of 500 just so you can use that damage perk instead of weight reduction perk
---
My 50 cal is executioner explosive with 1 perception 
---
About SBQ - I'm aware of magic weapons and I'm sure that fight with Queen was a short thing, not almost 20 min...
---
I loved almost everything about this patch.... EXCEPT "One Wasteland".  In my opinion, "One Wasteland" is the worst thing Bethesda ever did to Fallout.  I'm level 290, have been playing since launch, and I'm not a minmax build.  I'm a yearly FO1st subscriber and have poured tons of money into the atom shop ... BECAUSE I LIKED THE GAME THE WAY IT WAS.  As of "One Wasteland", Bethesda has turned the game I loved into "One Pieceofshit" that I wish I hadn't spent a dime on.  I've never been so disappointed in how badly they've destroyed what veteran loyal players have stuck around for all this time.
---
i do usually just give them away, wish there was just a more reliable place to do it
---
This would be amazing.
---
It's inefficient to leave your special and perk points on the table. I'm also fair certain that people who are optimized around VATS, crits, etc. are also capable of aiming for themselves, snark aside. I'm pretty sure they have put some thought and investment into that setup.
---
I personally have plenty of cards and swap into Encryptid mode (the layout I use for Encryptid) where I don't use VATS - but I suspect many others aren't that fortunate.
---
The in-and-out-of-VATS is the equivalent of multi-fast-travel ... and sucks.
---
☹️ that's unfortunate
---
Booo
---
Thinking back, this is what killed a few MMOs.  They balanced for the hardcore players.  It destroyed DDO.  They kept upping the power level to make it challenging for the grinders, which turned off everyone else because you couldn't play unless you had an optimized build with good gear.
---
When Drow came out in that game you would see people get kicked for having a suboptimal build and teams with LFM messages saying exactly what gear you needed.
---
Then the player base evaporated the game went for.  Don't even know if it is still around anymore.
---
Oh look, I am happy playing objectives, shooting covering fire and trying to get the drop on them by trying different stuff but that's in games like Battlefield and Battlefront where you can do that and I find that more fun.
---
I remember another group of friends and I were playing Rocket League and after winning a few casual games, wanted to go into the Ranked Matches where we kept winning.
---
He then started going into how we could totally try and do something with this and should get together to practices etc. Was funny watching every other person in the group and me shut him down immediately since he had a habit of doing that in every single game. 
---
Though he wanted to be YouTube famous and still does to this day.
---
I picked the ammo one and rad one for starters, got both to third level before I ran out of points to spend.
---
Now that radiation does nothing, I can stop stockpiling radaway and radx.
---
The ammo crafting plus my perks (ammosmith and super duper) is netting 360 each time.
---
Wow.
---
How do you know what they say? I'm not into that, so all I did was guess. ;)
---
Noted. That also sucks. 
---
"Click Y to write/erase/reload ... please note we will now ignore all other inputs."
---
So yeah ... UI says that ... the written description is there (and still dumb).
---
We’ll get em next time 😂
---
he has a cat irl if you actually payed attention you would realize this, and let him be if he wants to enjoy something, you shouldn’t hate on that.
---
Drop Iron Clad, Slow Metabolizer, Dromedary, Barbarian, Sturdy Frame, Strong Back, Travelling Pharmacy, Armorer, Thru-Hiker, and Demo Expert.
---
Get Max Blocker in strength, Adrenaline in Agility, Supressor and Tenderizer in Charisma, Max Lone Wanderer. Also max fire proof. 
---
Demo Expert isn't adding very much damage for you.. Adrenaline, and Tenderizer will add more in the long run. I know some of those Quality of Life perks to weight reduction are nice, but if you're a bit more optimized you won't have to carry as much.
---
Also, getting rid of your perks like Iron Clad will give you room for Supressor and Blocker. Supressor will reduce enemies damage that you attack by 30% for 2s everytime you attack them, and blocker straight up reduces enemy melee damage by 45%. 
---
Those two, especially blocker will help you tons.
---
i wish enemies lv is less compared to your own level \[or whoever is highest lv in an area\]
---
e.g. rad roaches could range from being lv1 to lv15 difficulty, super mutants cn be like lv 10 to lv 30
---
That's the spirit! 😁
---
Herbivore is a odd one.i didn't like it but I ran with it.get a few flowers and your good to go
---
My Instigating Pump Action has become my pesticide.
---
*Chambers shell* “Someone have a mole rat problem here?”
---
it's too bad that they didn't make it optional like Gearbox did with Borderlands 3. That would have been awesome.
---
That makes zero sense on what any of the items in game description. They either need to go back to the original or rename Instigating stats and sneak stats. Because it says double damage at full health. So if i take a Psycho it shouldn't base off of base damage it should base off of total damage....
---
Went in with 2700rds of 5mm ultracite, and 2 stims, 3 runs later, 5900rds of ultracite 5mm and 60 stims, it was glorious!
---
\+1 for savage divide
---
Also if on PS4 happy to help.
---
I haven't even gotten a "meh" plan. Whaaaaat.
---
Ima just delete cards i dont use anymore. I thought animated cards would give more perk points. Just spent most of it on ammo legendary, the rest just seem lacking of any oomph. Like 4 of them are explosive and its damn pointless
---
It was one of the easiest combos, which was nice.  I got 6-7 min solo completions on both of my characters with 0 fuss.
---
Fireproof rank 3 and a dense mod are functionally identical for explosions.  No need to have both.  Asbestos lining is a great option if you’re already using Fireproof.
---
I don't use power armor and I approve this message.
---
Also, poison resistance and disease resistance should be standard with PA.
---
Also, npc's should shit themselves a little when you walk past in PA. Seriously no one else wears the stuff, it should be really startling when you stomp past wearing a tank.
---
Mobs can’t be killed unless you are under the influence of alcohol? 
---
Great idea! Let’s put that one in there instead!
---
I thought they fixed the PA glitch? Did they not?
---
I loved how stoked everyone was on the soda fountain.
---
They need to scale the mid levels. For first time players 30-50 (and really probably up to 75 or so for real first time players on first characters) was already the hard-zone. A bit of love and weakening of the L50 and below monster stats wouldn't be bad.
---
I might be asking In the wrong comment section but I just got this game today and when I try to start it says that there's "a new patch available please restart the game when it finishes installing", so my question is what does that mean and when or how long until I can play?(maybe I'm just stupid)
---
Yes.
---
Do you think fo76 is an rpg? Explain how?
---
Also you are aware that people who are oneshotting have played through all the content in the game several times right?
---
They have already experienced the entire experience. 
---
Why should the reward for a grind be more grinding? What is the point of having 500 hours over 5 hours if the 500 hours player can't be more powerful?
---
It's funny how quick they are to close the most minor exploit. Almost as bad as rockstar patching a money glitch but leaving game breaking bugs in the game for years.
---
They disabled it to fix the bug where you could stack the STR Buff as much as you wanted so you could get like 60+ str
---
That’s because Xcom secretly fudged the percentages so a 95% chance to hit was actually higher than that. Because most players expect it to almost always hit, even when it’s only 1/20 chance.
---
Thanks 👍
---
poor guy lol
---
Then why in the content map does it say the steel dawn quest line comes out with one wasteland  https://twitter.com/fallout/status/1260933374090207234?s=21
---
Happened to me before the patch. I exited my armor, dropped all my fusion cores, picked them back up and was good to go.
---
Haha. Nice. Thanks for that
---
Thank you for the kind words! It sounds like you have a great thing going for you and your wife; I really hope there are some adjustments made and we can get some sort of middle ground as to what we have now. I
---
That's all i needed to know, thanks!
---
Just did 2 runs tonight on a team of 3 randos and no mics.
---
First was 7:20 or so, second was like 5 minutes. It was fantastic. Also, I have more ultracite 556 than I started with, and we killed the SBQ between those 2 runs.
---
EDIT: Was also revived on the second run ... with 2 sec to spare.
---
Yeah, I hate concentrated fire as I think it was making things difficult for me.. hitting limbs doesn't seem to stop the horde of ghouls, so I wanna kill them instantly instead :D and I left two legendary perk slots blank and filled it here with legendary Agility and Luck to get those extra slots so I can max adrenaline. Also, my shotgun is magic, I can murder in VATS, but VATS is broken most of the time and eats through my AP and fusion core a lot, so that's where my challenge lies. thank you for your input :D
---
Really? I mean, I’m sorry that’s true for you, but this was one suggestion I sent to them. It’s nice to think they actually did it.
---
I'm feeling like the buddy system is coming into play here.  It's almost like if you don't have 1 or 2 other people with you to distract all the stuff while you get the real task done, it's gonna be a lot of wasted ammo and stimpaks.
---
I already have two or three other people who are going through the same thing, teaming up just to get through simple stuff, we'll see how it turns out.  Feel free to join, PSN is same as here.  Whenever anyone's on I'll be happy to help.  Because I was actually decent at this before yesterday. 😜
---
Magic weapons are still around and are far more powerful than any other legitimate weapon. That being said, this will more than likely be fixed so don’t become too dependent on them.
---
Shit my character feels about the same. I was thinking the update might have been a good thing. Now I'm just sad.
---
Bloodied just got nerf’d to hell. I would avoid unless they fix this mess. I played for an hour and blew through 400 rounds of ammo and died 4 times. Level 150. Some fun.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but I thought Furious isn’t among the magic prefixes? I don’t think magic is patched this time.
---
Everyone should take a workshop, it's good for you!
---
Happ*ie* cake day!
---
I'm just waiting for the unstoppable monster to be added and I'll be sorted.
---
Nope not a fan of bloodied cause of the red on the HP bar. I prefer full health anyway. I have like 13 mutations and yes one of them is melee based. I haven't paid attention since the update but I was doing around 340 damage. Like I said I 1 to 3 shot most things. SB takes around 5 to 10.
---
I honestly don't play 76 to get the most powerful weapons. I play for the exploration and looting stuff. I play for that Fallout kick and the cool camp items and armor/clothing designs.
---
It's that taste of Fallout I enjoy whole not having to focus on a story and choices like previous Fallouts. It's a relaxing game for me. I do enough damage that I'm content. Wouldn't be much fun in 1 shotting everything I come across.
---
I once got wanted on accident by picking a lock to a workshop item, but the workshop was unowned so I didn't think anything of it. I was wanted for around 45 minutes before a joined a Line in the Sand and asked 3 people in game chat to "Please shoot me in the face." The first two people shook their heads no and the other guy took a couple seconds to turn pacifist mode off to finally kill me.
---
If you have a regular old shotgun with crippling perks you can take any assaultron down in one to two shots and just ignore him as he lays there. Same with deathclaws, ghouls, wendigos, etc.
---
You missed the point. How are thsy going to scrap weapons if they can't kill enemies? How are they going to make weapons if they don't have materials? Jesus.
---
Good to know re: fireproof. I think I only have one card but now I have a new open spot.
---
Gatling lasers are a lot less powerful due to the fact it only fires 1 “round” at a time, plasmas with the right mods shoot six IIRC. Still it shouldn’t take anywhere near 3 cores.
---
This would have been fun
---
Damn!is that with the max level on that perk card?I know about suoerduper and ammo smith
---
How does vanguards compare to using a PA; damage taking wise?
---
It list damage at 36 per. So not really sure whats going on. Its about the same with a scortch beast, maybe one less core.
---
Its so easy a chimp can do it
---
Don't think there is any benefit. It's the same either way.
---
Pre-One Wastelanders: Bloodied 10x stronger than anything else, no comparable second option. You could be a Bloodied build and kill everything instantly, but it wasn't necessary because you could be pretty much any other build and still kill everything without breaking a sweat. 
---
  
---
Post-One Wastelanders: Bloodied does less damage but still 10x stronger than the second best option, except now the 2nd best option does way less damage, making the disparity from Bloodied builds to non-Bloodied even greater and making Bloodied an absolute necessity, because otherwise your damage output is pathetic.  
---
What a stupid lack of balancing. As a Junkie's build this is probably the end of my time playing.
---
Its was just your toon...sorry  but your arms are too thin to lift those big weights
---
Yes friend, that’s my point. We who have hyper optimized have no issues. It’s the players who casually build their toons who are being run over.
---
I don't see a problem here?
---
no beam splitter
---
Aww that would be sick, no lvl 50s would try and mess with a 5* lvl 200
---
Same, I use a lever and mobs are still dying in the same amount of hits. I don't get it.
---
This is good to know! Thank you!
---
I see tha Halloween short suit but what is that mask.very nice
---
Man 1-50 was so easy for me. I didn't even mess with legendary stuff until level 60 or so. I hate that for you guys. Hopefully they'll change something around. Doesn't seem fair to punish lowbies for having unoptimized builds when half the shit you need is level gated anyway.
---
Agreed, cant wait to face a deathclaw
---
Sorry, i was probably not being precise enough in my first post.
---
No, what i meant was that i was concerned that i might invest coins to rank up Hack and Slash only to find out that it does not apply it's effect to Unarmed weapons.
---
But it's all good, i just finished watching an Angry Turtle video where he was beating the crap out of feral ghouls with a Deathclaw Gauntlet and Hack and Slash worked flawlessly with that weapon.  I think i'm going to have a lot of fun with that perk, lol.
---
Heavy gun perks will work they just won’t buff your explosive damage. What the not working with explosive weapons mean is things like the missile launcher or fat man won’t get increased damage from them but your Gatling laser will. You may have to use  power armour to get most benefits out of heavy weapons perks I think one man army and stabilise perks may require power armour. Take the first rank of each heavy weapon strength perk as that gives 10% increase each further rank gives only 5% so for 3 ranks that’s 20% increase for each card so with all 3 at max gives 60% increase. Also the base damage of heavy weapons is much lower than rifles for example but the fire rate is much greater so yes the amount of ammo is far greater. I hope this has been useful and Demo expert does buff the explosive damage part.
---
It says "Fall".
---
I think its because if you use sneak in daily ops you can just sit at the sites and then just run  and kill the boss. That too easy
---
I bet you think they're going to do something too
---
4 months ago 
---
Idk when this will be implemented but I hope soon
---
Same budget trouble happend to me, thus i'm afraid to scrap anything at my place, because i'm not sure how much my budget excess the limit. 
---
You weren't using any of Atomic Shop items, were you? I have some Commie items and Blood Eagle Nest in my camp. Perhaps they could affect their budget size, because i've seen them in a change list.
---
I'd be into the game eventually scaling levels up further. If they wanted to better justify it they could expand the legendary system with new perks or such as well. Added bonus it basically nukes anything duped or any overpowered legacy weapons. Till the next dupe or overpowered legacy weapon.
---
Exactly. Instead of fixing the floor, they messed up the walls. You were able to put weapon displays on it with zero problems.
---
He said furious 50 Limb damage &lt;---
---
I just logged on.  It told me the reward tiers were incomplete when I first opened it but when ai checked again a few minutes later it says they are all complete for today.  I have only done 2 Ops today.
---
I'm seeing really weird shit with my two main characters, a heavy gunner junkie/full hp and a bloodied/junkie commando. Sometimes legendary enemies won't replenish HP even with the notification saying it has mutated, sometimes I waste half a clip to any common mob to see the HP bar regenerating from 20% to 100%. I have a very shit connection so it might be lag, but never happened before.
---
This is a great and thoughtful response. Thank you for your input!
---
Thanks, I will give them a try when I get some new perk cards.
---
I don't think I have ever seen something that people asked about more in such a short period of time (while also somehow missing all the other posts that have been made)
---
Yes, I was using just a prime quad radium rifle and even with that had a net positive of ultracite .45. Quad plus gun fu was cruise control in today's Ops.
---
The compass at the bottom of the screen pulses when you're in the circle. What more do you need?
---
Ooh, taking one for the team with electrical absorption. The impostor sheepsquattch must not have a good time.
---
Time to farm some ultracite ammo.
---
/u/valseek, /u/ladydevann, and /u/lonevaultwanderer
---
Tagged in a reply because they don’t get the notification when it’s only in the original post.
---
Yeah but at the beginning one could at least hope even though honestly fallout shelter was the indication that bethesda was interested in how well gaas would pay off.
---
Can you post the picture again? The imgur page isn’t working
---
Oh no, when a buggy door closes, a buggy window opens. Thanks for letting me know - hope they fix that soon too!
---
I think it's more for people who, like me, would take workshops for challenges, but don't want to deal with initiating PvP
---
Not sure what mods your Gatling lasers have but mine only has the beam focuser.
---
Started a new playthrough just for this.today I took down a scorchbeast and a sheepsquatch ..both 1 star around level 40..sheepsquatch eventually took care of the scorchbeast and I went through about 2 or 3k worth of rounds with 4 different guns.all in all it's been pretty good.
---
my main is still a tank.Daily ops with my low health build got the 2nd rank on my 1st run.its a solid update. No longer am I just vats 1 hitting everything
---
I play destiny 2 as well as 76 atm and A few months ago they changed the pvp matchmaking to skill based matchmaking rather than by connection. I was originally glad with sbmm as it meant A more fair playing field. But listening to the top tier pvp players talking about every game they played being super competitive and someone explained that with sbmm every match even amongst the worst players would always be competitive changed my view/mind on sbmm.Thats when I realised that variety in player skills is what made pvp more dynamic and interesting. 
---
I hope that same aspect doesn’t deter people from playing having to always face enemies of their level and higher.
---
Edit:wording
---
Ran Vault 94 today 3x with randos and never went over 7 min.  It was an infinitely easier run compared to Burrows and Bots even with the splodey Eagles
---
Last I heard, it's like a 32 year old professional student who has one kid with another on the way with his girlfriend working full-time.
---
Yes I know LD is one of them, but I remember a youtuber (could be angryturtle) said because Furious caps the damage, the magic effect won’t proc.
---
Good deal.. seems you're on a pretty good path. Didn't notice you put your gun on there, lol.. sorry.
---
What kind of shotgun is it, out of curiosity?
---
And yeah, shotgun with VATS you don't need the extra headache of aiming at certain body parts. Pellets to the chest work just as well.
---
I'd also suggest checking out Ammo Factory for crafting your ammo.. you'll likely have to use more now, and that'll more than offset the amount you use.
---
Very similar experience with me. Thank you for sharing. 
---
I am happy that - as you have pointed out - the gearing process hopefully should be easier, but we’re going to be viewing it through the lens of veterans who are familiar with the gear grind. It’s going to be interesting to see how they’ll fare with a difficulty scale that slides away from them as they try to gear up.
---
Thank you. Still figuring out how to be an active redditor!
---
So if I did the elder tier today and got nothing am I out of luck for today? Because I’ve did it at least 10 times an haven’t gotten anything all under 8 mins
---
Nukashine is supposed to do 100% x3 with party boy.  If you use only that it doesn’t add up right
---
The patch notes say they are implementing that feedback over time. It was necessary to move from combinatorics based damage calculations. Leaving the game live for a week or two to get whole of community analytics will lead to a smarter update
---
I'm one-shotting level 75 ghouls with it, and I was never able to one-shot them as level 63. Looks like it's working for me.
---
I dont think there is a way to switch from public back to private team without leaving the team and starting a new one
---
Which one are you stuck on?
---
Defo gonna keep this in mind for when i level enough for the perks (alot of these i never acquired in the 1st place) thanks for the help!
---
So mines rank 3 and I was testing it earlier with my friend. Even if were in a fire fight or it says danger and I'm sneaking, it's still working. I'm not getting any pop ups, or indicators, but it applies at the server refresh, so it might take a second to start showing the increase in damage. Side note, it also seemed to be working in the daily ops, he let the flamers heal his PA while I played around to test the perk
---
Thanks for the correction, sorry about that, I’ll edit and let OP know I’m wrong!
---
Thank you for the kind words!
---
I'm still a killing god on this game. I dont even need my legacy guns to murder stuff fast.
---
Didn't test it, only got to play it yest and today and you're on the money.  Ignoring the mobs and getting to the SB's is the key.  Then piling in and getting the boost?  No reason not to get Elder unless something catastrophic happens or someone body blocks boss
---
What?
---
The thing about "Broken Sneak" is that more players are running in Public Teams now, and your teammates actually affect your personal sneakiness.  This is the main reason why you don't get the Sneak Damage Bonus despite being in \[Caution\].  Depending on the stealth status of your teammates, the rules for \[Caution\] get changed, invisibly for the player.  You just can't do Sneak Damage Bonus anymore.
---
It's always been this way, but we're seeing it exposed a lot more now.
---
This game sucks.. again lol I bought it on release and it was broken. Waited for awhile was playable. Then tse cane out got one and thought it was 2 easy. Then they broke the food system where I couldn’t walk for 2 seconds without being hungry. Quit again. Started to get back into it a month or so ago was having a lot of fun now this. Sucks again. I was in a group with all high levels and great builds and we couldn’t even get earl to mutate in the allowed time let alone actually kill him. Bethesda can suck a fuck.. lol
---
look, i am a level 70 player who just launch my first nuke a week ago, the things about my 30s is that i basically brave through a lot of 60+ mobs, the thing is: level in FO76 is not that much of a thing, you can still kill a 62 with ~lvl30 shotgun with relative ease, I just bring a galting/.50 cal(preferable for the attack speed) and ~1000 ammo just in case, so I really don't think wasteland for all would make things more difficult, just maybe you need to upgrade your arsenal.
---
(P.S. join line in the sand whenever you can would bring you tons of fusion core, farm lead for ammo, mark adhesive/aluminium/screws/springs you will soon be hoarding them)
---
What if they have 2 game modes. The old adventure mode and a one wasteland mode that would be nice
---
They do, it just doesn't show up in upper left corner
---
OP I’m sorry for the bad info, got my mods mixed up and was thinking of the beam splitter on rifles.
---
Hahahahaha. Well, you are a nice person for taking the time to coach them a bit. I’m sure they are grateful for the help!
---
Sounds like you just don't know you can use your mouse to turn your character to see enemies. 
---
I'm also a  bloodied sneak commando and I did it 8:10 solo and around 6min in a team. Never died
---
I feel like they should make the weapons and gun's scale to you 
---
Like you're lvl 1 and find a lvl 1 pipe rifle
---
As you continue to lvl up it will scale to you 
---
Now for other weapons/armour that are capped at lvl 50 (Ultracite power armour) you have to be lvl 50 to use it etc
---
Bad explanation I know im on mobile and don't have a whole lot of time
---
I don't notice much of a difference. Still feels the same more or less for me, in some ways even better than before.
---
That seriously some bs. They should test this shit before releasing new stuff. That bench was super useful.
---
I am embarrassed to admit I’ve died twice now in Manhunt.
---
Ah thanks. That explains why mines not working
---
You have to claim it in the shop then craft it in game. I just got Fallout 1st last week and that's how I got the armor. Happy scavaging.
---
Let's just be clear.
---
"Magic" is a euphemism invented by Angry Turtle.  It's a cute little buzzword that wallpapers over a more basic truth: these are damage exploits that, in many cases, actively harm the gameplay experience of other players by melting bosses and denying them credit, sometimes even to the person who took the time to run the silo.  There's nothing "magic" about them, and if you choose to run with them, you do so at your own peril.
---
if 76 is running isn't crashing on the alternative drive then it seems as if there are errors on the original drive. you could check for errors by going to "this PC" right click on the original drive &gt; select properties &gt; tools&gt; error checking and click on check and follow the instructions. this may find any errors on the drive/ bad sectors and "fix" them.
---
Damn, I’m really sorry to hear that. I hope this isn’t the case and you find it in you to stay the course.
---
Just tried to solo this today, and was amazed  that an ant took 6 shots to take out - WTF? This was my last straw onto games that are fun.
---
Just got to level 15 on my pipe pistol on my brand new character. Git Gud scrub. Also having cannibal helps.
---
 I still need rep so that’s a huge plus
---
I'll be surprised when Bethesda release something for this game that isn't broken.
---
Yea I was pretty disappointed when I saw this season. I won't be actively pursuing it and I'll get what I get through natural play. I think they just set it up as a low effort copy paste job to squeeze out some atoms.
---
Yes, I have another character lvl 136 &amp; it's a shotgun build. Might steal the shotgun from it. I actually got the same shotgun a week ago but I scripped it 😔 Luckily on this lvl 170 toon I have 23 spare perk points so I might change my build.
---
You need to break your armor. It keeps the perks not the DR
---
Because PVP still needs effective armor.
---
Yeah 9 of those were redundant you lost out on the rare reward after your first completion- u still get legendary rolls tho
---
It's more at least throwing a bone to players so they can adapt to any sudden big balance changes. Like give some "respec tokens" or whatever whenever this happens.
---
Yea my build was pretty much still god like.
---
That is my understanding as well.
---
Probably just trying to balance out all of the "this game is ruined!" posts.
---
And it is fall, assuming since the rest of the content for this drop is here
---
I knew something was up. I felt invulnerable
---
I ran it a few times with my friend (so much ammo, its amazing), and we had people join us pretty regularly. Never had that issue, on Xbox if that helps
---
Id watch that
---
I'm on PC but using the Xbox Game Pass so I think I'm xbox.
---
back to the grind...
---
I'm a heavy gun build, mostly 50cal. On my way north or south I would stop by toxic larrys meat shack to kill the 3 snallygasters for acid. This was a net positive as i would 1 shot each with a instigating 50cal hunting rifle before patch 22. now I need my vampires 50cal MG to kill them and first time went through &gt;200 rounds. now i am getting that ammo count down but it was net negative for acid to craft ammo. Ammo factory with ammo smith and super duper change it back. But it grindy time again where I spend all my time searching for resources rather then wandering the wasteland. I've grinded enough since beta and this sucks.
---
I am a older guy who sucks at playing video games, and really just wants to relax. I've leveled up to get the benefits of being able to one shot most creatures and have a routine with my friends where we just hangout.
---
This whole change seems to be to make me consume more resources and have to grind more. ENOUGH. This is not the game I bough. This is not the game I played for 2 years. Give me back my game.
---
The glaive is way better I have heard
---
Yeah I actually liked roaming around and crushing things in the forest whenever I just wanted to mess around, drink a few beers and play casually or not take things too serious
---
U/nukacrypt said the codes now reset on Wednesday, did you have yesterday’s codes? 👍🏽
---
Well it only took 5 months to fix the queen landing so I'm sure bethesda will get right on it
---
Try not being a greedy little bitch with your carry as much as I can convenience build. About time Bethesda stopped rewarding idiots like you.
---
It's actually a "Scorched *Annhilator.*"
---
I had close to 300.  I spent at least an hour buying Adamantium Skeleton over and over.
---
&gt; That being said, this will more than likely be fixed so don’t become too dependent on them.
---
Yeah, magic weapons stick out like a sore thumb now that everything else has been nerfed. Which will be putting more pressure on Bethesda to finally roll out a fix.
---
Took me two years to pinpoint all the gunpowder weighing me down in my misc tab.....
---
all but line in the sand. that one is ruined
---
just saying if you need a cap sink why not go round to noob camps and buy some stuff might not be as good as gold bullion but it will make some noobs day when that nuka cola or random gun they are selling gets brought, plus it puts more caps into the economy
---
I demand cat power armor.
---
Think about it... it could be powered by fusion cells instead of fusion cores
---
Why is that one ruined? I never got any legendaries there ever
---
It's still working as far as I can tell.
---
I think one thing that could give you a false positive is that sometimes Earle's orange spit lands on level architecture above you, spreading out where you can't see it, while casting damage downward.
---
Where is this new tree house village? 😃
---
You'll get really sad, really fast. The Unstoppable Monster is no longer a monster, much less unstoppable.
---
Flamers were changed to fire damage for a short time but they became way too powerful and they reverted the change pretty quick. This patch actually changed the Shishkebab to be fire damage.
---
funny that was a thing in NV with the mantis if they where small enough you could just crush them
---
You can’t pick up any scrip. Weapons or armor at all. It gives you the option to “equip, favorite” but nothing happens when you try.
---
My gt is CELLUL0SE (it's a zero) add me if you want and we can try but I'm doubtful
---
I got 3 junkies shotguns, one was short pump with the bashing damage, 2 combat shotguns with the limb damage, and a junkies explosive fixer which is doing pretty well than my shotguns tbh, ammo is the problem.  I plan on getting the legendary ammo perk last though. Gonna remove far flung fireworks and replace with legendary Intelligence I guess. The quicker I level up, the better (I sounded a bit like Ward there :D)
---
I am about maxed on gold. Maybe I should buy a ton of lunch boxes for double xp weekend then i will have so many levels and coins.
---
Levels 30 to 50 for me were rough BEFORE the update. You just barely start needing ballistic fiber for repairs, but you likely only have like 2, you can no longer scrounge all the ammo you need, and you begin to really feel it if you don't have good synergy with your perks.  If you are pushing into the late game that is. Now, throwing in the fact that you can no longer be OVER leveled... Yikes.
---
Idk man - a pack of bears probably would take out a deathclaw
---
Yup. Just recently I was back near the Overseer's camp and came across a Scavenger looting an empty box. I had a chat and then just out of curiosity, I pulled out my x2 Shot 50. Cal.... I was literally two feet away from them and it took two shots to their damn brain before they dropped.
---
Note that I also have all three Rifleman Perk Cards active and maxed out and it still took x2 shots to their head (which was x4 50. Cal rounds) before they died.
---
I also have a x2 Shot Combat Rifle, one Shotgun Perk Card Maxed and with my stealth perks. Originally, this would take out most high level enemies in one hit to the noggin if I wasn't detected.... glowing ones and legendary gouls took two or maybe three shots.
---
Now it takes two point blank VATS Headshots to kill a damn Mole Rat (That's x4 Shotgun Rounds to the skull)
---
It took the same amount above against a MK0 Liberator at point blank 1 min later...… They're a fk'n toaster with a laser. I should be able to kick the damn thing into a wall and carry on.
---
This isn't "Fun" it's BS... like I'm playing Final Fantasy on the NES with a dice roll on damage, regardless of where I shoot.
---
If I take a damn sniper rifle and stick it to the side of a scavenger's head and shoot, a 50. Cal Bullet should take their head clean off, even if I'm level 2. They shouldn't just go, "Ow, hey man, stop that" and then get several shots on me while I rebolt.
---
to be fair be in enough teams where people don't revive you and if i am the first one down can you blame me for instantly killing myself?
---
I was wondering why I was fighting a level 39 molerat near Sutton!
---
Based on my little bit of experience with P22 I'm not sure there's even a point in using the weapon perk cards anymore. 9 perk points to get 34 more damage on my stealth commando? Why not just put those points into something else,?
---
Put on a piece of armor with reduced damage while blocking by 15% and try again...
---
This update is amazing I'm having a blast not blowing through everything.
---
Level 170 here with a rifle build and my gawd I have no ammo and died more in a single hour then I ever have before the update
---
Ah the correct side!
---
You would be correct. Today’s wasn’t bad. Still a little too much endless waves but the modifier was cooler.
---
The thing is, Bloodied *is* just fine. It's the other affixes that need to be buffed accordingly. Like Berserker's for instance, running around at with zero dr should give you as much damage as a 5% health bloodied. They are essentially the same thing, both of them are glass cannons. It's just one of them has no dr max health and the other is the opposite. Junkies is fine where it is tbh, seeing as you only have to sacrifice a bit of SPECIAL for a 50% damage boost. The other weapon affixes are all fine the way they are, they are specialized for their specific purpose. The only thing I would do is add a Day variant to complement Nocturnal.
---
The problem stems from the fact that Bloodied is just *that* much better then the other affixes *AND* that it combos with Unyielding armor to improve it even further plus other things like mutations/Nerd Rage. There needs to be more synergy between other legendary weapons/armor, not to just nerf Bloodied.
---
You are 100% right.  I also had several ballistic weapons for different enemies and after testing everything in my arsenal only my magic DB is worth using.   I have a nice TSE HM and before it would take perhaps 2 shots to kill a lvl 50, it's now taking 4 or 5.  Forget fighting robots with it, I used to be able to kill a Gutzy with 3 or 4, I counted today and it took 12 shots.  It completely feels like I'm being forced into choosing a build (and probably one I don't enjoy playing) and then suck it up.
---
My little cultist alt uses wood armor because it looks cool. And now that sneak is trashed everyone can see it!
---
Hell yeah dude. Got me the Elder Rank too, and was only with one other guy. TS Tesla Rifle with FFR was working wonders for me down there.
---
ok
---
I think I’m not going to be successfully soloing “Feed the People” any more.
---
Actually, I'm Level 97 (not &gt;100) and everything is Level 50 or higher, always.
---
I would like this.  That could benefit both sides, everybody wins.  I preferred it how it was before this update.
---
Maybe the 2.5x is on the base damage of the gun, instead of the damage of gun buffed by perks, because of the change to additive damage calculation.
---
its all about you. all of this.
---
Yeah they do I removed the door and just put a wall for now.
---
They already have 2 bars with perks, you need a 3rd?
---
Yea. Both maxed now. I found it tedious when doing both factions at the same time but thats the most efficient. There is a decent guide if you google.
---
My point is that all the map says is that it's released during the same season, not on the exact same day
---
The armor itself has to be the same, not the effects.
---
One of the major changes in patch 22 was to make damage bonuses additive (the way I am explaining it) from multiplicative ( the way you explained it originally).
---
Lol. You might need a nap. Or a cookie. Probably both.
---
It stopped happening to me once I got rid of healing factor.
---
I look for magic and hacked weapons to be next on the chopping block, they have too much good publicity from the past few updates to let these huge issues go unaddressed.
---
Or how about let us use the perk coins to purchase new perk cards
---
Lol
---
This keeps happening to me. I wasted an entire mag trying to headshot at 95% chance of hit. I am tearing through ammo.
---
Respawn in ops seems to stay at 3 seconds for me, better to just die if you aren’t near the uplink. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I respecced to a STR build from commando. VATS and Sneak were already buggy but I put up with it because concentrated fire was broken and made combat simple and ammo efficient.
---
After the patch I used up all my ammo in a day missing shots trying to get to 95% when I could have just aimed manually.
---
That and the new leveled enemies and their higher stealth detection just doesn't make the spec worth it anymore.
---
I noticed mine aren’t performing as well either and may have to try something different weapon wise.
---
🤣
---
Finally it adds a bit more challenge though. But yeah it does suck about ammo a bit, but if you start out with low amount of ammo on a gun in an Op you'll come out with way more than you started I had guns ammo I only had a few hundred shots for up past a thousand under running a few of the Daily Ops. Do wish VATS was more accurate though it is a major letdown wasting AP on a shot that broadcasts 95%.
---
Design philosophies: You forgot to add mobile game. They're fighting the complexity of the engine and core design ethos. They want the game to be an electronic pachinko machine where the gambling addicted players press a button, look at what that gives them, sell off what they don't want and then press the button again, ad infinitum. They don't want to add game play, that puts too much time between button presses.
---
You'll aquire new ones.
---
Alright that can make sense, seems like a weird way to do it though buttt thats bethesda. Thank you and have a good evening
---
I’m an optimized combat build and I’m just as bummed about the changes to the forest region. I have no shortage of bullets. I have no problem putting down level 100 deathclaws. 
---
But two things really bum me out:  
---
First, sometimes I just want to go someplace peaceful in game. Like, this place, for all its faults, is my escape from worry about life and sometimes what I want to do is stroll down the banks of the Ohio River and pick snaptail without worrying about mobs of level 50 mole rats. I just want to listen to the water and watch the sun go down and not think about survival all the time. 
---
Second, I do occasionally create new characters and have relished the absolute terror a level 10 player feels the first time they wander into the wrong part of the map; that feeling like, if you’re spotted, you’ll die. That’s gone now, and it’ll never be back the same way. 
---
And yeah there’s other things that suck; I’ll never be able to farm leader of the pack for level 5 legendaries to build out and gift to newbies and a hundred other things. But understand it isn’t just casual players that are kinda disappointed in the changes. 
---
I don’t care about the increase in difficulty; my character can handle all of it with no issue. What I care deeply about is that most of my friends are casual players, older like me (I’m 50) who don’t want to deal with the hassle. They’ll go find something else. The social aspect of this game is *everything*. Without it, the game dies. 
---
Hang in there. If there’s one thing we can count on, it’s Bethesda changing things repeatedly.
---
It verbally doesn't explain that in game. It says x2 damage and x2 at full health nowhere in game does it say additive. I dont understand why they changed that because it just makes Instigating and sneak attacks look fake.
---
Yes I got max rank for both factions and now I want to go to their camps and slaughter them all.
---
This post right here. I feel like a simple "Tab WT (weight)" next to your overall carry would be a great, yet non intrusive addition and I'd never again be sat there flipping back and forth and scrolling through every tab just to find out I had 6 missiles and a heavy metal chest.
---
Plasma or laser? Plasma core are 250 and if you made them with an ammo modifier like ammo smith or new perk card you get some that have an overcharge. If its a fusion core those are 500 a core and then you got some issues.
---
Just choose Professional Drinker and keep choosing it. The Perk Choose screen will automatically select it again as your next perk, as it is totally alone its list if you sort by cost. It's one rank, so you don't have to skip the part where it asks you to rank it up. I did this 250+ times on Tuesday, and it did not take as long as you'd think.
---
I can help if you still need it done later, but out of curiosity what is your int at now that you can’t mod the rifle?
---
Glad I could help!
---
I usually have VATS issues with my Bow, still missing at 95%.  I am still doing close too 400 damage per shot with a Bloodied Explosive Bow.  I ran Daily Ops with it, died a few times because of being a Bloodied build, but every once in a while I was able to one or two shot an enemy with it.
---
Yeah, I didn't particularly like any of the legendary perks, like why would I want enemies to explode? That would only be helpful in mobs. The SPECIAL ones are great tho, I already have the STR one at rank 3.
---
I got them overcharged bc of perks is that the problem?
---
Level 50 mole rats will likely beat me down in the near future.  After 800+ hrs, time to move on...
---
I lost more ammo then I gained,
---
Oh fuck that thing! I tried it twice and got so pissed off I deleted it from my CAMP. What a goddamn stupid interface.
---
There is supposed to be one coming. It was confirmed [about four months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gjnp7y/full_respec_option_is_coming/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
RNG is a cunt sometimes. I got the vault 94 stash from my first and none today. I didn't come on here to whine like a bitch though. Instead I know how MMOs work and how drop rates work and sometimes you just don't get lucky.   
---
I am thinking these kind of games are just not for certain people, especially the participation trophy crowd.
---
As the other person stated. You have to use the same armor type not effect. So you need to wear all leather or all combat for said effects to work.
---
It was fun too. You get a ‘splode! You get a ‘splode! Everyone gets a ‘splode!
---
Players shouldn't have to be shown how it's done to be successful. In fact that a pretty good indicator the game is not well designed.
---
Thanks
---
I think you're correct about that,
---
Doing both isn't an issue, I've got Raiders maxed. Settlers are just taking forever.
---
Agreed. I’m not sure how I would be making it without my junkies combat and double barrel shotguns with magic effects. Using chems more often and pumping up adrenaline has helped me make up the difference for the most part.
---
they need a snickers and a timeout.
---
Any recomendations for where to farm some of those settler random encounters?
---
Mine aren't I'm getting around 360 damage per headshot using VATS with no notification.
---
Whilst outside of VATS I'm getting around 540 with a notification.
---
In Ark definitely.
---
Yup I use one that says "All yours" and I place a candle next to it so it's lit up at night.
---
I also use the same sign next to any workshop extractors I power up.
---
I feel like a lot of people who commented some version of ‘suck it up’ &amp; ‘respec’ don’t get the gist of what a casual player is. 
---
At level 133 with nearly 500 hours of gameplay, how long is it going to take me to grind my way to changing my PERK points or PERK cards to be some stupid build that I clearly didn’t want to be in the first place? Having to pour over sites for build info is kind of not what casual play is all about. 
---
I’m annoyed that a WEAK FERAL GHOUL in The Forest can take 1000 damage and take out 1/4 of my HP in a single hit.
---
I launched from Alpha right at 3 o’clock cst... Little over 6 1/2 hours ago and the nukacrypt code worked for me. I Musta got in right before they reset
---
Same. I was Lady of Death build. My build is totally and utterly broken.
---
An atom bundle if you bought it, you got the Pint Size Slasher outfit. Not sure if they'll bring it back though
---
Yes. Yes we do
---
Thank you!!!
---
I'm a long-range stealth player. I always am. I played that way in Fallout 3, 4, and New Vegas. I played that way in Skyrim, Far Cry 3, 4, 5, New Dawn, The Outer Worlds, and the last two Assassin's Creed games. It's my way. I tell myself I'm going to try something different, and every time I wind up in a Chinese Stealth Suit with a dozen Stealth Boys in reserve. I'm never going to be a power armor brute that charges into a crowd, smashing bodies with a steam-powered sledge. I understand that some people like that, enjoy that, even thrive on that, but that style does absolutely nothing for me. 
---
So I really only have 2 issues with the patch:
---
* Stealth is busted. The way I enjoy playing the game is totally busted.
---
* It's incredibly difficult for folks UNDER level 50. And since fo76 showed up on Game Pass just 8 weeks ago, there are a lot of people under level 50. We haven't finished the main questline yet. We don't have access to top-line power armor yet. Legendary Perks don't mean anything under level 50. Even if I grind up to level 50, my version of the main questline will be more difficult than your version of the questline was. It's like playing Call of Duty on normal difficulty, then mid-game being told that only veteran mode will be available from now on. 
---
Since the old stealth strategies are broken, the only option I really have is to go MORE stealthy. I'm going on farming runs to build up a stockpile of ammo before I go into the last fight of the questline. The rules of engagement are to avoid detection and fire no weapons. I move stealthily through hordes of ghouls and packs of super mutants, stealing desk fans and clipboards from under their noses for springs and screws. I lug 800 pound weight sets from various gyms back to CAMP for the lead content. I just got back from stealing 260 burnt textbooks from a single house, which scrap into cloth for gunpowder. Yesterday, I had no ammo, today I have 400 in reserve for my sniper rifle. I'm thinking about 1600 more should suffice. For that weapon.
---
 It's a hard life, but everything else has been taken from me.
---
Ultracite cores require the prime receiver or equivalent mod. Normal weapons can’t fire ultracite rounds.
---
&gt;  After the freshness of it wears off, you’ll see an exodus of players who feel that the combat has become repeated encounters with bullet sponges.
---
For myself, a moderately optimized 112 stealth commando, I'm only going to be logging in to do the dailies until they correct this incredibly short-sighted and poorly designed situation. Tried Heart of the Swamp and went through 671 rounds *alone* to kill the queen that shows up at the end. Jail Break? 800+ rounds and still failed it. My 24 alt is frankly unplayable. I have no idea how lower-level characters are dealing with this.
---
I have a feeling this exodus (or, more likely, hiatus) is going to come sooner rather than later. Last few days I've only seen one nuke launch during prime time where I usually see at least four, and the person who did it was 485, so I'm thinking the ability to solo a silo is going down the same path. I'm sure the drop in concurrents at peak is going to get their attention--or at least the attention of the analytics and marketing teams that seem to drive most of their design decisions any more.
---
Thank you for this well thought-out and comprehensive post.
---
&gt; The thing is, Bloodied is just fine
---
Not when it's in a class of its own. You even admit that further down your post.
---
&gt; It's the other affixes that need to be buffed accordingly.
---
Power creep is a slippery slope.
---
While other legendary effects need to be looked at. Understand why Bloodied is so good. Because it synergizes so well with other perks &amp; gear that the negatives of having low HP is hardly an issue.
---
&gt; Like Berserker's for instance- They are essentially the same thing, both of them are glass cannons. It's just one of them has no dr max health and the other is the opposite.
---
Berserker's also can not utilize many of the same benefits as Bloodied that mitigate having no resistances.
---
&gt; The problem stems from the fact that Bloodied is just that much better then the other affixes AND that it combos with Unyielding armor to improve it even further plus other things like mutations/Nerd Rage. There needs to be more synergy between other legendary weapons/armor, not to just nerf Bloodied.
---
In what way? How are you gonna add more synergy to the perks that benefits each and every legendary effect? 
---
It's much simpler to lower the damage buff ceiling of Bloodied than to go and tweak several perks to somehow benefit all the other legendary effects.
---
265 weight in just those plasma cores, damn...
---
Yes
---
Dam, lucky. I got the fucken vault 94 stash box and yesterday the light bulbs :(
---
3 and while I only need 3 my gunsmith is at 5
---
I think every area has a minimum level so this doesnt happen
---
6 shots tonight at 95% all missed. Wtf.
---
Turns out I overcharged the plasma cores lol sorry for the confusion
---
Darn. I can only wish you the best of luck then. :(
---
Ok.ill keep a eye out for it...def looks rare.dont think I seen anyone using the mask
---
I'm hoping they buff the lever but for now I'm swapping out my lever and black powder rifle for a radium rifle and Gauss. The radium is a lot better for follow through.
---
How do u trick the game, I would like to know of this
---
I did yesterday's op about 13 times...... 3 7:45 clears with a squad of 3-4. And 9 solos in under 12 min, because people quit right at the start or midway...... no plans.
---
Yeah and I haven’t tried riding shotgun yet that’s an event I love soloing
---
If you open the battle report to see how you did it will kick you out when you close it.
---
Try around Charleston. Barn at Charleston station. House just besides the fire breathers/purveyor. There are a few others scattered around but just starting out might be advisable. Keep in mind the pond/barn at Charleston station might very well be the most popular spot I’ve ever seen.
---
Low leveled scorched don't exist anymore, sadly :(
---
This post could have been worded better. I think you’re meaning to say “it only takes 4 caps to get to *a* train station from a free fast travel point (R+G station from Foundation)” but the title reads like you’re saying “all train stations on the map now cost only 4 caps to fast travel to, regardless of where you are on the map.”
---
Cancelled my membership tonight. I was raging all day playing this. Its not fun anymore.
---
TIL Sheds are female.
---
Now I just feel silly.
---
I sat there for days pondering over what he meant.
---
It was all so simple.
---
The answer was right there, in front of my face. 
---
Darn it xD 
---
Good job on figuring that out!
---
Umm mate I'm pretty sure you can craft ultracite plasma cartridges 😅
---
I belive you're done for the day reward wise
---
I know I got so excited for it when I saw it on the front page and was disappointed when i looked in the atom shop
---
With One Wasteland your damage should scale everywhere on the map, if you are having issues it probably means you are not doing enough damage. I know that sounds harsh but that’s Bethesda’s idea of balance at the moment.
---
It’s probably time to go back to the drawing board and take a look at your build. Invest in damage and sneak perks, move points out of any nonessential perks like gunsmith and general utility perks.
---
Unless it's says no power armor then it should be fine, test it out, it's literally only one coin to change it if it doesn't work.
---
Rocking fireproof and admantium skeleton, less hurty boom
---
Colossus legs don't take a lot damage. Before the update I did 388 damage on 3x sneak with a bloodied deathclaw an had a 1.6k damage in my pipboy. Body shots were 600 an critical was 800 or so. Sbq was entirely different. I did the full damage or more up to 2.2k. Haven't gotten a chance to do the events after the update though.
---
No, they just have extra shots. Its not a bug.
---
Yeah you’re right. I’m level like 87 and I’m like you. I like to really explore and enjoy my surroundings. I started playing from the start but took a break when thongs were shaky untill they got better.  Then I got back into it over the summer and I was enjoying it. I mean I could handle myself. Kill higher level and same level enemies without too much difficulty. I still couldn’t take down a scorchbeast by myself or an assault Ron, but I liked going to low level areas to collect materials without wasting all my ammo.  I’m trying my best to have a decent build but I’m stuck to having a couple weapons that are actually able to kill anything. A sniper rifle, the fixer, and an instigating double barrel shotgun. Now the only thing that even gives me a chance is the shotgun. It’s not fun anymore. I don’t understand why they wouldn’t make this patch and option for players. You know like the hardcore survival modes of the past. I think the old game let you choose the enemies difficulty in the menu if I’m not mistaken. This just isn’t it.
---
Most of it's on mules
---
Make a daily ops team, wait for folks to join, do a follow emote, start daily ops and they’ll get a notification. It also does say when someone is (IN DAILY OP) on the party window
---
Join or create a daily ops public team first.
---
As somebody slowly working their way to optimization with baby steps (getting 1\* weapons and armor with the right perks, building up perk cards, etc) can you share some of your secrets? I'm currently a lvl 210 bloodied heavy gunner/melee/shotgunner depending on my mood.
---
Join a team that’s for daily ops and when you see them load in hit join team for it. Today’s one prob can be done solo. I did it three times first was with a level 800 and 300 I’m 320. We finished at 13 minutes then last two times I did it with a level 29 and 60 we missed elder by 7 seconds first time and redid it right away and got 6 minutes. I will take that team over anyone ever again
---
That’s because it wasn’t nerfed. It’s still multiplicative while other prefixes are not. AA is arguably one of the strongest prefixes in the game now.
---
Just checked you can mate
---
Thank you.
---
Join a daily ops group, if there's at least 2 other people, I've found that if I go the others follow. It's worked for me the last two days.
---
Good
---
I don’t mind it. I don’t want to hear that DJ talking when I’m at my camp. Make that talking at all.
---
I died in Uranium Fever and I was like, what just happened?! I'm gonna have to pay attention more from now on.
---
I snagged it on the middle rank and then didn’t get it for elder!
---
Me too, it's just that everything is work now. Head to vault 76, level 50 guys just waiting for you now.
---
I appreciate the level up, but maybe 50 percent of what they did would have been adequate.  The poor deathclaws are still weak, regardless.
---
The grind from levels 30 to 50 used to suck, i can only imagine now.
---
Anyone on PC (low levels) needs supplies, HMU, same IGN....
---
Change to commando. Way more dps.
---
Ah drink some nukashine, takes you to all kinda neat camp spots.
---
My suggestion is find an explosive laser or a handmade if you like rifles. Good luck, friend.
---
The most reliable way is probably using mic to tell them you have spare plans to gift lmao
---
I’ve gotten vault suit yesterday As the only reward and today I got liquid courage for second tier then when I got elder I got vault suit plan again. We just gotta grind it everyday and hope we get the better ones
---
It might be because of the fact we are all now fighting enemy’s that are leveled up to are own levels there harder to kill
---
There’s a house on the outskirts of Morgantown you can build in, towards the south east not far from the farm
---
You only have a chance to get the plans 1 time per tier. They say if you get elder on the first try that it combines the chances, instead I think it could be best to do initiate, paladin, elder so 3 total times. I soloed the robot one I got no rare on initiate, I got the 94 stash on paladin, got nothing on elder. Did todays got elder first try no rare (did get a bloodied FSS +1 S shepherds crook) did it again since my son needed it got elder he didn't get a plan either he also didn't get one doing elder yesterday.
---
So all I can say is RNG is going to be a cunt.
---
Earl has 80% reduction And 400 dr. Queen has 70% and 300 DR.
---
The toxic valley has a house a farm and a shed that you can put a camp down. It's nice. It's on the eastern part. You can't take the entire area (camp size is too small) but pick a spot and it's nice.
---
Rip my lever also. Used to be one of the most powerful rifleman weapons, now it feels like a pea shooter.
---
You have a magic shotgun. Congrats. Can one shot most enemies in VATS ONLY. Don’t use it outside of vats.
---
It protects against waterborne diseases
---
I only want the unstoppable monster.
---
Ranged is better suited at killing everything now except daily ops with resilient. Even with 3 20% melee buffs I’m still doing pathetic damage compared to a commando or heavy gunner. It just gets worse against tough enemies like SBQ, Earle or imposter.
---
They expected easy pickins, but Bartender Beckett got to servin'
---
And the fast travel bug is still there.
---
Where is it and is it somewhat intact because most houses there are destroyed
---
This one was fun. Yesterday’s was not.
---
Exactly. I've been saying similar in the last day..... increase the mob levels to the player to make things more challenging? Sure.
---
Reduce / Nerf the Weapon Damage to make things more challenging? Sure
---
I can manage either / or and adapt.... but both at the same time?
---
It's a damn chore to play now (I'm a Lvl 97 Stealth Snipe/Shotgun - No Bloodied/Junkie/Mutation) - My character isn't viable anymore.
---
I did Radiation Rumble last night and even with my x2 Shot Assault Rifle and all x3 Rifleman Perk Cards Maxed, I did sweet fk all to the mobs. Before the update, if I was in sneak, one or two head shot in VATS could take them down. If detected, I was having to land 7-10 rounds to drop one enemy.
---
Now I have to unload an entire x25 round clip into their skulls just to take their health halfway.
---
They need to fix this crap. There's nothing fun about this.
---
Happened to me earlier on about an hour ago too. Luckily I have my daily rewards.
---
Yes! It was like an ammo and stim factory, I love it. I had a hard time finding the exploded bodies though
---
Didn't you have to use melee for all the robots?
---
Or just don't want to be a bother if someone is actually using the place
---
I found your 'T' .
---
Yeah it’s way more fun
---
Personally I'm not a fan of pure RNG. I much prefer 'pseudo RNG' like a lot of other games are doing now. Under that sort of system, the game keeps a 'pity counter' of how many times you've tried and failed to unlock something (despite meeting all the requirements each time), and after enough failed attempts the game literally takes pity on you and gives you the unlock for free.
---
It means the grind is still there for most people (if that's what the developers are going for), but it also means you as a player are actually making some sort of progression towards unlocking everything, unlike pure RNG where you could potentially have a million attempts at something and still fail to get the thing you want.
---
For those future googlers, I have just checked - yes, the Legendary perks do increase your strength, even if you are already at the 15 strength in special point, and, as advertised, you do not get the Perk Points.
---
All Huge Questers rejoice - our Strength have just increased by 5!
---
??
---
I do not believe any of the outfits that came in Atom bundles have been rereleased or added to the store.
---
This one is. The inside is cluttered though I'm not sure what can be scrapped or not. When I get on on an hour or so I'll find it and let you know where.
---
So your trying to give people a exploit to fix the nerf they just got BECAUSE of an exploit. Loke if they wanna enjoy the game again actually play the game like you should instead of acting like spoilt children and whining that your overpowered build got destroyed
---
It doesnt work with Revenant I know that much
---
Yeah I like the weight bench and the metal floor. That’s about it
---
Definitely add nerd rage if you have a low health build, that is mandatory.
---
Add Nerd Rage
---
bleh kids
---
I use to hit for over 300 some headshots with bloodied fixer on Earle I now hit maybe 80 some I think. He goes down easy still with a team but it’s def not like before. And I don’t wanna jump on bad wagon but I know I had a anti armor handmade 1525 forever now. Never used it once I got bloodied fixer. I mean my fixers will kill most things in one to two hits but I went down near prime today and a 3 star beast came out of the one fissure. I switched to anti armor and destroyed it. Was hitting well over 100. Idk I’m glad I kept a ton of weapons on all 5 characters because I’m def going to be playing around with all my weapons
---
Either way, it’s pointless using a shotgun outside of vats for any real damage. The only reason a shotgun is decent is because of the vats being magic - without it, it would be trash tier.
---
Phew, that boys got some strong ankles, any suggestions to up my damage?
---
funny thing is according to some people in universe the Pipboy is basically a piece of Robco trash due to how overly common it's meant to be, all Vault dwellers have them, Doc Mich gives you his despite how useful it is and with the exception of the 3000 series they seems to all be very basic just look at the 2000 series, it's barley got any features in it besides a diary
---
Happened to a group of us earlier. 3 of us started, a 4th person joined in and the meter wouldn't budge. We all left and came back as a group and finished in 5mins (:
---
Yes but if players count as humans too it doesnt loose any effectiveness,it simply becomes more usefull,now we have daily ops,when you fight vs blood eagles you can use that too.
---
Raiders are pretty industrious....
---
I would if I had any left...
---
Come on Nov release of cyberpunk!!
---
How about by making One wasteland a separate mode like survival was? then after 6 months they will see which mode most players prefer to use and just close which ever one isn't popular. That way they know they are doing the right thing by there customers.
---
I like the idea, except I think working the other way would be better tagging weapons and armor so you can’t scrip or sell them, sometimes my weapons randomly un favourite themselves, I’ve sold my BEfixer twice by accident because of this.
---
Yea I ran stealth sniper for hours and hours and wanted a change so no stealth, really don’t wanna do stealth melee but might not have a choice at this point.
---
I read this as "that's what the muscles are for" lol.
---
Did it solo today 8 minutes flat for elder. Probably wasted the 20 seconds time that you didn't trying to find the room and waiting on the final boss to come out rather than hunting him down.
---
I am too. I grinded long and hard for enough levels to comfortably get 6 legendary perks maxed. As a AAE stealth commando I’m enjoying the update so far. I have been AAE for months now. Daily Ops are a bit too easy but maybe they will add difficulty tiers or something. One Wasteland adds some grit to the wasteland, low level events are now worth doing. The combat rebalance nice too. They just have to buff up the weaker prefixes now.
---
And you're right, I had a furious 25fr Minigun with already 255 fire rate, and it didn't do shit. It was as strong as it should be, no magic.
---
the effect of the Gamma gun is to hit people with radiation it's effective against biological enemies because it stops them healing radiation damage with the exception of ghouls and other mutants
---
Obviously; however, a bugged weapon could literally mean a thousands of things. Magic refers specifically to the addition damage.
---
V, AA, and TSE are really strong now.
---
No errors detected
---
Oh jeez this is so helpful, I didn't know there would be a notification. I will definitely try that next time!
---
Yup
---
Never doubt them chicken legs.
---
As for damage maybe  try and switch to a power attack weapon instead of swing speed and keep power attacking. 
---
Assuming youre running martial artist and n incisor .
---
Im not on melee man so cant offer much advice.
---
Sorry for the simple fast response, been trying to answer people’s questions best I can since the patch came out.
---
Thanks, I'm gonna give it a shot
---
Level 245 here with God roll armor (Uny/Ap/Sent) and god roll weapons (B2515R fixer, BE90 lmg, BE15R laser rifle, B2515R tesla) and appropriated specced for all of these weapons - i died over 30 times in the robot daily ops. shit is hard
---
I don't think this damage nerf is permanent. Just the first step in getting better balance. Granted it was dumb to nerf damage and buff enemies in the same patch. Give it a bit and hopefully they'll manage to change some damage numbers without breaking everything.
---
Lotp  still only drops one stars at least the two times I did it today
---
That’s great, but it’s is not viable for boss fights. No offense but you are getting carried if that is your damage. SBQ and Earle have much higher damage resistance so you’re probably hitting for less than 200 a swing when someone with a fixer is sitting back emptying mags that deal the same amount per round. Never getting feared, never has to run, hardly ever has to adjust.
---
Oh and they don’t need to go farm 5 different food buffs before the fight either.
---
Glass house!
---
They count. I maxed mine and did just that. Still have 15 points to out cards into.
---
Your fine I actually prefer to respond quickly and be responded to quickly and not waiting for like 10 minutes, as this reply will reflect lol
---
This. The rewards are the same day-to-day each time. It's just the faster you complete, the higher the chance of rare drops.
---
I was a melee man, no it seems I’m more of a tickler man lol! Thanks for the help!
---
It's about as fine as pre-nerf tigris prime
---
Srsly: wild mongrels should not make me sweat!
---
Just use ammo factory and Ammosmith if you’re running low on ammo. Tons of yield.
---
No sir.
---
great idea .. or a perk that drastically reduces their wear and tear.
---
removes the use for gunsmith unless youre modding.
---
yeah, why?
---
Knowing Bethesda, I wouldn't make that assumption :p
---
I am still liking shotguns. Enemies die very fast. Now lvl 100 deathclaw takes 2 shots. Not liking that hip fire seems buggy like oh -90% damage oops let me have 50% back ok shot #2 / rinse repeat.
---
I’m like level 79 and a level 60 scorched can still kick my damn ass. I’ve stopped playing this game for awhile. I like it a lot, I like doing the quests and most especially building my camp, but it ducks you have to plan and make a special build or have TSE  weapons just to be able to survive in the game. Idk maybe it’s just me but I’ve always had combat problems since the beginning.
---
If a raw strength of 30 isn’t enough to lift those weight s it better be the weight of a train😂😂
---
Correct. None of them have been repeated. 
---
Those were really good deals, too. $10 for 1500 Atoms, the Apparel plans, and 6 kits.
---
Absolutely the specials are awesome. I actually like the stealth range attacks do more damage for 10 seconds though. And the power armor respawn legendary is op too
---
You wanna have it?
---
Yeah, not exclusively though. I could take them out in 1-2 punches usually. The others would shoot them until their health was low and I’d either finish them off or they’d butt them with a gun.
---
We didn’t try to fight anything between uplink points. Just run in, hold position, run to next position. Heal up as needed.
---
I struggle on my non-bloody and non-junkie rifleman build https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f275e8&amp;d=sg2s01pd2pk2pp2pl2p02ek1ce0cu2c62ic4ar2an2ao0l71lt2lu2a71a04x00xm0&amp;m=051c249f7b3 
---
Weapons I use are anti armor level action rifle,  instigating gauss rifle, anti armor fixer, and vampire handmade. I have a few vanguard armors with action point refresh. 
---
Before one wasteland, this build was serviceable. But after one wasteland, I struggle with it. Now I only play on my bloodied stealth commando. I wonder if one wasteland pretty much kills rifleman build. 
---
Any help is appreciated.
---
Damn I always miss the good bugs lol
---
The cap is 15 as far as adding perks to it. So if you add a maxed out Legendary Strength card, you’ll have 1 extra slot (15 max) but 19 Strength overall. Say you move 5 points to Luck. You’re down to 9 strength but the Legendary Strength perk card would now give you +5 STR and +5 Slots. Hope that makes sense
---
I turned it off when wastelanders came out and never looked back
---
You can no longer force the scorched to all spawn at the beeper (well it’s much harder to)
---
Dumb question, but you have the stable flux needed to make the cores, and not just putting it in the 'what you can build mode' without the flux, right?
---
I also agree that Bethesda defenitely nerfed the weapons way too much. I like that enemies are now scaled to your level but they should really go back to the previous weapon damage - and the sooner the better. A lot of my friends have already stopped playing and im asking myself, is this why i really bought the game? Ofcourse not.
---
It was our money and you decided to totally change what we actually paid for! Is this style gonna continue from now on? If so, i am not gonna buy any more games from Bethesda because I want to know what I actually pay for , and then expect what I pay for will continue to be - what I paid for.
---
This happened to my raider collectron today.
---
Will she or won’t she? She would.
---
legendary perk that increases damage when in a team   getting it to rank 4 massively helps.
---
I saw a level 50 radroach tonight and almost shat myself. Those fuckers are too damn fast.
---
Perhaps you shouldn't tell people how to play their games
---
Anyone know if xp leeching got hit by the nerf too? I know areas have level floors but wouldn't be surprised if for low levels Whitesprings went from level 60 ghouls to level 30. I also don't know how much that would actually effect xp
---
Regardless, wouldn't mind trying to carry low levels to help them deal with this nonsense, even if I can't carry as well as I could before
---
That was actually fun though. It was terrifying as a level 20 to run into a level 45 scorched or ghoul surrounded by a bunch of level 10s. It got my heart pumping as you tried to find some high ground or a way to escape. It was like a mini-boss.
---
Now? You just run into eight level 20s that overwhelm you if you aren't wearing PA or have 15+ stimpacks (which you can't just farm from starter areas anymore..)
---
I'm very appreciative my magic Quad DB still dishes out the DMG.  Was tiring of it before the patch but it's quickly fallen back into favour.  My TSE handmade along with my extra talon gantlet are useless.  I have also notice my plasma's gives out more DMG to the queen since the update so I'm loving them.
---
Dumb question....does power armor count?
---
Maybe you shouldn't expect to enjoy the game if your not playing by the rules.
---
how would a jukebox get a radio signal when it runs off cassette tapes?
---
Everything will be s level 50 for you now..
---
Goodbye vampire bowie knife, you will be missed, and always rememberd
---
What's your build? Maybe you can optimize it \^\^ 
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
As a level 165-170 heavy gunner power armour build nothing is more dangerous to me than 3 or 4 stingwings. They shred my health quicker than a pack of wendigos at the earl fight. I can take more hits from level 80+ alpha deathclaws than i can from stupid stingwings 
---
Their attack is brokenly strong but that has never been an issue before as they were always just a strong level 5 bug and anyone over level 10 could destroy them with no worries. But now oh boy they are stupidly op
---
Finished it in under six minutes on the second attempt with a stellar group, picked up the symptomatic plan for my efforts. It’s *so good*.
---
campfire tells wrecked me last night.
---
Would be a great skin for the combat rifle!
---
So people start whining as soon as there’s a bit of a challenge involved?? 🙄
---
Have we all noticed that? Because I still do things the exact same way I did before.
---
I was just on and I still don’t have the option too craft them. I assumed it’s something that automatically unlocks once you learn the prime receiver plan right?
---
Some items can’t be displayed
---
Yep it's great it only cost me 70% of my unarmed melee damage
---
I had such a fun time especially when my friend who’s like level 40 run into the mix screaming from all the explosions but we did finish in elder time and got the vault 94 stash box so it was great
---
It's not just for low level players.  It's anyone without an optimized build. I'm level 90 and I can't clear daily ops.  It takes more hits for me than the ammo they give back.  I've run out of ammo all 3 attempts I've made on daily ops,.  I just spent an hour and a half farming materials for ammo just so I can play tomorrow.  This is really NOT fun and not just for low levels.
---
To be honest, whenever the SBQ lands I just hit her in the face over and over and never take any damage from her. The enemies she spawns barely do much to me either.
---
If I'm being carried then okay, no biggie. I'm not one of those players that needs to deal tons of damage. You only need 1000 damage on the SBQ to get loot from her and I do it every time without fail. Earle is an annoying boss, on Xbox the event was dead within a day and the two times I did do it, it took forever and most people gave up, it was down to like 3 of us and we finished him off.
---
The boss seemed cool in theory but in execution it didn't work cause no one seems to care to waste the nuke on it, myself included.
---
Really? I thought it was the "enemies in daily Op won't die" from yesterday lol
---
I'm pretty sure you auto lock it when you start the game mate lol. You could always buy the ammo from people
---
One thing that urked me was "Looking up optimal builds to stand a chance". You won't, and you wouldn't have before. This game has always been the same since people discovered Junkie/Bloodied builds. You will 100% lose your "chance" (to tag a mob? Get to an event in time? Kill stuff?) To a bloodied user, or a two shot explosive gatling user, or a junkie user, or a combination of any of those three, especially a bloodied two shot explosive gatling user, or even just simply a bloodied gatling user. In some cases a bloodied Fixer user cause apparently Fixe ris broken and I don' tknow how or why but whatever. 
---
Even if you do the same build, you only get a 50% chance at that point of losing your "chance", it's whichever one of you bloodied gatling/fixer/commando users hits the mob first. 
---
This is how the game has always been, forever. You either conform to that and try to "compete" against the others for shit, or you play wha tyou want while still trying to be optimal for combat. You CANNOT just go into utility perks like you did and expect to perform well in combat, that's not how MMOs work especially. You choose the higher power item, or talent or spell, or in this case Perk, otherwise you fall behind. If you expect to continue progressing wth little to no commitment into an actual weapon choice in your perks, you don't know how to play the game. Was the game easy enough to do it before hand? Yes. That isn't how a game like this is supposed to work, and it's a big reason why a lot of people were just bored of the world, there was no fun in the combat, shit died too easily, or you felt useless compared to higher levels (if you were lower level anyway). 
---
The game still has a problem because the 1% of players at the top actually got disgustingly stronger because of One Wasteland. I digress though. 
---
Start investing into weapon perks and perks that compliment your ewapon choice or you'll fall behind, that's just how it is, and I see no problem in that. You still have a way, albeit slow, to shift around points and get new perks later until they put in a better respec system. 
---
And yes, the majority of people who enjoy the update are high level players, or just players like me , level 86+, who are not "high level" but actually am in the sense that my build is done, i have a demi-god rolled weapon and I can hold my own in almost all content, which I personally bleieve should be it. NOBODY hsould be able to solo bosses, NEVER die without spamming stims and drugs, or annihilate waves of enemies like wet paper with any weapon, period. I want bloodied/junkies/commando/gatlings balanced and nerfed to remove that shit, BUT....veteran players will stop playing. Newer payers coming ito the game don't realize it's a problem till they've already invested enough time into the game that they will casually come back to play anyway. 
---
Veteran players kept this game alive, period. So this update being for us Veteran players (i'm a day 1 player, but i'm not a DIE HARD player, i made a second character for a new build so that's where most of my time went) is good. On top of it also being for lower players because you can actuall contribute to events more now to get gear and feel useful, not just getting dick slapped across a field and dying.
---
I’m not sure what you mean, but it take cartridges not cores. I crafted cores originally and it wouldn’t allow me to use them with that gun
---
Pails haven't been duped on Xbox and ps4. There hasn't been a dupe since they came out for them.
---
So fun fact, wood has never had a sneak buff that works. Not for the last year anyway. The shrouded mod has never worked to my knowledge and until a few months ago the shadowed mod to improve stealth only worked on leather armor. As of now shadowed works on all armors that can equip it. Also, the escape artist perk renders armor weight effectively 0 for sneaking so that doesn't matter either.
---
Look up AngryTurtle's video on it on youtube if you'd like the details.
---
There's a fallout 4 mod that does this
---
It's human sized armor though
---
Shout out to all the 50 year and up players!  We should group up sometime.
---
Junkie’s faster swing speed, no paint
---
You can build on the shed that is at the cat house located between Morgantown and bolten greens.
---
I have no respect for bloodied idiots that die over and over and over, stay dead or better yet leave the ops.
---
We all know it's going to be handmade like boring as usual
---
&gt;fully optimised build
---
&gt;BSS Tenderizer
---
Choose 1
---
I went from 1600 damage on my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet to 400 max. Ugh.
---
correct 
---
when you could everyone had a chance at the xp now its back to it all being spread out and only getting a small portion of the xp. 
---
the event never gave rewards worth doing it, the only reason to go to it was the good amount of xp. the way it is now you might as well go to top of the world or a fissure site and basically get the same thing 
---
run around alot and get a smaller amount of xp all to your self not shared like it was
---
Which rules? Where are the fuxking rules on how to play and have fun in fallout 76 because as long as i know i can play how i want it, it's not like im expecting fallout 76 to be a fifa but to be able to play it the way i have been doing it
---
Ahh that makes sense, thanks for the confirmation!
---
I had fun with it too. I'm bloodied, and went in with no power armor. Thanks to the new legendary endurance card, I had a ranked up fireproof equipped and the explosions didn't do much damage even when I was going melee.
---
I got one of the exploding legendary perks too, so there were a LOT of explosions going on!
---
I never did the Vault 94 raid while it was running, so I'm glad they've opened it up again.
---
Yes you can use both funky duds and sizzling style with PA
---
So because it’s a little challenging people whine and complain?? It’s supposed to be a wasteland not a stroll in the park people..🙄
---
I hope not. Handmade (aka ak47) already had the AR-15 style skin.
---
Assuming they will need to tweak some more.  A couple events I jumped in on seemed to adjusted timers etc.
---
One change I do not like, at all, is the increase in weapon/armor damage.  I run the weapon decrease 5 star and whatever it is in Lucky stat; went from double to broke in about 2 hours.  
---
Armor is like glass.  Trying to fit in the armor lucky perks but its super crappy to half to keep fixing something every 6 to 10 events.
---
I did full fix on EVERYTHING last night before logging out (assumed allll my broken stuff was due to that hard ass robot OP).  Today I had limited play time due to work; so about 2 hours to complete events and an Earl.  4 armors broke and my primary gun.  Pre patch I probably did maintenance on gear every 3 days, with 5 to 8 hours a day played.  I keep a backup shotgun and cannot even remember last time I used it.
---
The transformers have entered the chat.
---
It was my very first daily op after not playing FO76 for weeks... and without seeing the impact One Wasteland has had on my build... cut me some slack. 
---
My second run was much better after I knew what I was getting into. Switching from Rifleman to Commando helped a lot. No need to get offensive.
---
It's disabled right now, it gave a strength boost, but it was bugged and could stack infinitely.
---
how do they decide? i can display my blue ridge caravan mask, and reclaimed mask from earl.
---
I just spawn bought the same first perk (action boy/girl) and then leveled them so it would be quicker to scrap them. I’m level 440 only took like 45 mins. Its feels really nice not having to scroll though all the useless perks now.
---
You seem to have your sights set a lot lower than I do. That’s fine. But the fact of the matter is my 2 handed build lost about 70% of its dps and my unarmed lost over 90%. These nerfs are way too strong and they didn’t give us any good legendary perks to make up for it. 
---
Commando and heavy gunner on the other hand got nerfed way less and they have good legendary perks as well. Melee got the shaft this patch.
---
Picked up the repeatable weekly XP challenge twice, every time I ran today's Op. Loving these events!
---
I guess I’ll have to go on lookout for them, I don’t know why I still don’t have the option
---
I am on Xbox yes
---
I agree 100% , They could have just made the mobs that spawn during the calibration tho have the perception.
---
Yeah, casuals are getting hit hard by this nerf/"rebalance."
---
Restarting (several times) did fix this.
---
  I was not clear with my sarcasm.
---
Their money-making links were working but their already-paid player links were not.
---
Thank you for the helpful (non-snarky) response.
---
  I seem to see more help than griefers/haters on the threads vs. game play.
---
Oh there is a cap in the forrest. Its just that some dipshit dev thought it would be smart to set it to fucking 50 because its a ChAlLeNgE
---
Yeah, wood is a toolset armour, carry and swap what you need when you need it.  Which goes with the ethos of free-states inspired goods, I guess. I like the speed of sneaking around, although I noticed they no longer list it explicitly in the "effects" pip page anymore. 
---
Use mine with black BOS underarmour, black cowboy hat (and now) the vault 94 mask. It's a good look.
---
Ahhhh, that makes sense. Thanks for the info!
---
I can't believe that when they tried to fix it they made it worse. I didn't think it was possible to be worse but Beth proved me wrong.
---
Depends largely on your build.
---
That seems unreasonably high. The legendary are the feather in the crown build items right now. They aren't meant to be easily accessible right away.
---
I think opening up more ways to earn them (First SBQ/ACP per week, chance from elder rank in daily ops, etc) is a good SLOW way to add a few more in, while encouraging people to do the big fancy content. But figuring casual play time, I think 5 levels a week is a decent clip, so you're talking maybe 20 perk points a week. Your suggested rates would mean you could very casually double that rate, and likely even triple it with some effort.
---
HMU, Same IGN....
---
It was datamined as a handmade skin so yea it's going to be handmade which sucks cause handmade has so many skins
---
I’m not sure but I k ow I can display the Raider Mask from the Wasteland sera quest but not the unique Assaultron helmet..
---
Yes, but you can't have it 😁
---
I kind of miss running into a squad of low level super mutants and just devestating. Them.
---
That's all I needed to know. THANKS!
---
You have to be killed by somebody, it's the only way.
---
Strip naked and wait for the inevitable beating. (Not even joking, it makes *their* job easier, and saves you on armor condition)
---
I’m not saying the mongrels make me sweat, I’m just saying it’s make more sense for the most challenging enemies to be Lvl (inThe Forest) &amp; scale that down when it comes to things like mongrels, wolves, mole rats etc.
---
Insult me and dont address the fact that indeed that is what you do, why does every single game have to be dumbed down for people like you. Go play Fortnite and stop ruining sandbox games.
---
I'm on the "This is great, but it definitely forced me to change the way I play" side.
---
Ugg
---
I would just put it in the stash Until mannequins come out and then put it on that
---
That’s basically what I did for my second run. Was much better. Guess I really have to say goodbye to Rifleman...
---
They're only following the business model that works for modern video games. It's survive with micro transactions. What studios are out there still making really quality single player, no in-game store games? I'll wait.
---
I found him in the berkley springs train station

---
VATs feels more broken than it already was with this new update. I'm missing most VATs swings in melee.
---
Did you give yourself ammo from another character or something? How on Earth do you even have enough to sustain yourself?
---
I actually do understand where you're coming from. The game is definitely catering more and more to not only established and old players BUT especially to players who have been around for a long time. New mechanics are introduced purely to help those people find things to do meanwhile content for newer players seems few and far between.   
---
I actually agree with you that they need an update that focuses more on the early and mid-game at this stage in terms of giving you more versatility with what you can do. The expectation of this community is often just to grind until you get to level 50 but that's WoW level bullshit not stuff people expect in a fallout title.  
---
and yeah idiots saying "just get X build" tend to think everybody just wants to waste hours away grinding for better gear so they can complete the same content faster.
---
This update would’ve been perfect had they introduced the changes one at a time. OW and the damage nerf at the same time was a horrible idea
---
Good advice from Dingo, I’d like to add that I have heard on the forums that vats is bugged right now for sneak attacks and any vats attacks will not have the sneak attack multiplied attached. 
---
If so, that could explain a good deal of it.
---
Instigating weapons that can reliably headshot will solve most of your issues. I’m a shotgun build and at worst it takes two rounds to drop a L100 supemute from stealth.
---
We can now apply Combat Rifle skins to Fixers. That should help.
---
Now I finally feel good putting my camp in the more pretty parts of the game. I have mine right smack in the middle right now and I don’t like it. I love the toxic valley and it’s atmosphere though. I’m gonna live just a few minutes walk from wavey willards!
---
Pales that we had stashed.
---
oooh yea, will look sweet on maniquins!  (in 5 years when those finally exist)
---
Yup. With more missions getting added in the future, that may/will change
---
Thanks. I will try that.
---
I think that's the point, everyone is saying you should optimize it but I like the builds I have and enjoyed playing them.  So my options are, either change to something I don't like, spend money on gear to continue, or find another game.   I think I know what the right thing to do is.
---
That said, thanks for the advice, I played around today and did some things to make my rifle build a little better but ultimately I am nowhere near as good as I was a couple of days ago and I am dying way too often.  I've very fortunate I didn't turn all my cards in for legendary perk coins or I really would have been screwed.
---
It was in the game from start. I guess this is bad damage registration,cuz fallout 4 engine weren't made for multiplayer. 
---
(Actually after that patch I have better registration,don't know why)
---
I also can't put my tattered mole mask in there.  
---
seems like a really weird selection.
---
She wanted them and by what I heard it was either that or he'd be alone. He probably could pull another girl back when he was 18 but he has absolutely 0 to offer now.
---
just crazy enough to work!
---
I like how I levelled just collecting scrap.
---
About time that 'daily level' didn't require making a new toon every day as I'm not a XP stacking unyielding kid. I can do it wandering around just exploring.
---
I do smirk a bit about the shit I've copped as a 'food build'. I seem to still be thriving post patch.
---
I think it might have something to do with the size of the item you try to put in there:P
---
I'm not finding the nerf to be *too* bad so far. I'm running bloodied with a mix of commando and melee, and I'm still taking down enemies quickly.
---
The legendary perk cards let me equip a couple extra damage boosting perks, so that probably helps.
---
There's that new ammo crafting card that you might want to check out. Even rank one ups your crafted ammo by 50%. (Anyone know how that stacks with ammosmith?)
---
I stop in occasionally to see what's happening but I quit 76 at about level 70 on the season 1 pass about a month ago. I gave into their WoW scammy you need to play every day BS.
---
Been playing civ.
---
Maybe I'm biased as someone who quit 76... but I'm a huge bethesda fan, been playing since Oblivion between them and elder scrolls.
---
They lost their way with this game.
---
I'm glad you're moving on too!
---
I don't get it , level 50 mobs are supposed to be a challenging no matter what type they are. There is a scaling, like Mole rats are weaker than FErals, which are weaker than Charred ,which are weaker than Mirelurks, which are weaker than Deathclaws (we all know DC suck, but you get the point i'm making). 
---
This is how it should work in my eyes. Levels past level 50 don't mean anything, you just start unlocking more perks, but you don't actually gain anything else. A level 500 is still a level 50 player, you just have all the perks unlocked and upgraded and a lot of playtime. Legendary perks are the counter to that, so high level players can feel more unique and a tad stronger. 
---
YOu know if the Legendary Perks didn't mostly suck outside of the Ammunition one (the fuck were they thinking on making this one?) or the SPECIAL stat increases, which I just went two of those on my character who's melee lmao.
---
Everything go ‘splode!
---
Huh. You know, that’s a good way to do it.
---
To be fair, you're level 43. You're reaching end game with no good legendaries or armor. This is when the game is supposed to feel hard for you. From here you get your gear and shit becomes wet paper and ti becomes boring and not challenging.
---
Gt narmyknight. Ill help you with a care package and a guardian for levels. Can also give a short guide on where to get materials for crafting as well.
---
Definitely an easier location and easier enemy type than yesterday. We could complete it at elder tier with a duo team. Fireproof perk helps a lot.
---
I know this would be an unpopular opinion, but I just see this as an absolute perfect match for the 10mm smg. 
---
Down to the sights and all.
---
Okay I’ll check there Thankyou;)
---
Happened today with my buddy too
---
All i got from this is "me and my god roll armour still enjoy the game"
---
Must be nice
---
This is it exactly!! You are right on the money with this! I loved just walking around the forest region just for the calm of it! I also gift goodies to newbies and just chill for a bit! That isn’t really here anymore!
---
Yep, they made everything harder resulting in much more ammo/stimpack use yet they added absolutely nothing new/tangible in terms of rewards. It's all the same stuff and even though now as a level 65 I'm killing freaking level 50 mole rats, scorched, gouls, etc and wasting those extra resources on them I'm getting NOTHING different in terms of loot for that stuff. It's inexplicable, really. Like they think the ONLY thing the majority of the people who play this game do is go right for the hardest events and even then the rewards are still just the same stuff over and over. I just don't get it.
---
Not just wasting ammo because of vats accuracy and dmg being broken, now we waste more because sneak is also broken now, strap in, it’s gonna be a rough month lol
---
Yeah, level 50 radroaches are some bullshit.
---
Just make another character and move it to the one you want. I have 2 of them now but I’m on Xbox
---
i think it has to concentrated firing as well.  like, put all the shots in more or less the same spot
---
I think you would like ghost recon wildlands
---
I cant wait to turn my back against them
---
Nah if you geind it out over and over, you can get legendary items
---
I’m 50 in a month! I hear ya! ;)
---
Tracking Unknowns
---
You can try running chkdsk to see if that finds any errors
---
Windows key +r
---
Type in cmd and then press ctrl+shift+enter (you should now have an administrative command prompt
---
Type
---
Chkdsk /R z:
---
Where z is the drive letter of the original 76 installation, it may say that it can't lock the drive and would you like to run it when the pc is next started, type Y then restart the pc and see if that finds any errors.
---
After that I think I'm out of ideas if it is error free.
---
I finished the first season a few weeks ago and picked up Wasteland 3 to keep me going until Season 2’s release. I am a stealth build at 102 and I could barely kill anything. Scorched that were 1 shot kills were taking 4-6 bullets and these were the push overs. I completely agree that it is no longer fun and I might need to walk away from it.
---
Nice thanks mate🤟🏻
---
Thanks for the tip, I did equip it today but I have no resources so I'm going to have to dump a decent collection of armour and weapons since I'm also at max caps since I can't sell it to make space. I HATE THAT!
---
Not sure why high levels complain about events scaling to actually be a challenging for them now. Not saying OP is aying that, but some of the comments are.
---
This was a BLAST! I didn't even expect me and the rando I public teamed with to get Elder rank but it happened (stay close to the uplinks!) With my shotty/demo build and the mutations the explosions were fireworks central! Rewards were great as well. This is something I can look forward to on the daily, literally. Thanks Bethesda! Between wastelanders, legendary run, bug fixes, one wasteland, and daily ops I'm glad the me from a year ago was proven wrong. Only rank 115 (on and off since beta and I play solo/public team), but this is a whole different game and I feel rewarded!
---
I just started playing on computer about a week ago without looking up anything about updates.  Played tons on Xbox, but have not played for a long time (since before they added NPC's).  Jumped in and was having a really good time seeing what had changed and was making my way through the wasteland.  Then the update dropped.  Now, it takes a stupid amount of ammo to do any mission and i have to have a ridiculous number of stimpacks to survive almost any encounter.  Made it to level 13 before the update in about 3 days, now in two days i have moved only 2 levels.  I have to scavenge to make ammo every time i turn around.  Cant even farm lower level characters to level up or get resources/ammo.  We will see how long i can keep interest with each mission being a grueling time. I can see how the update is nice for higher level players, but i feel they should start the matching at a certain level like 75 or 100.   I thought up to end game was fine and did not need messed with.
---
I got far flung fireworks. It seems to proc more often than I would expect. It's fun, and exploding enemies deal area damage that seems about equivalent to a frag grenade. 
---
I already had nerd rage, though, and if you can only have one that's better.
---
I’m getting solid damage out of Gun Fu at the moment.
---
Wholesome
---
Damn that does suck. Guess I'm lucky, although if you can still 1 to 3 shotting most enemies like me..thats not bad at all.
---
Maybe don't solo defend a junkyard at level 6. I think it's also that high level players are so used to the abundance of ammo, power, defenses, stims, etc, that now they feel so gimped even tho I believe this is how it should be. Solo defending a junkyard when you're ill equipped for it? Yea you should be fucking struggling to do it. PIstol whipping them? You don't have a melee weapon as a backup.
---
Funny you mention the add thing.  I found myself taking a break on Earl every 30 seconds to clear adds and rez people.
---
FYI, not in 1%, but running shotgun build and working on SS armor.  Almost level 200 and I prefer to run high HP.  Damage did take a hit on some things, but pretty sure that's due to my lack of armor piercing.  Call me top 10% build.
---
If you follow along the original point, the game is multiplayer. This patch is encouraging people to stop playing single player and start playing multiplayer.
---
The game has always been multiplayer, not single player.
---
They have options if you want to play single player.
---
They do if u are a low level.
---
"harder" would be making you actually have to strategize, but I've seen little to no strategizing born from the update, save for altering loadouts to deal with daily ops, which I think is good
---
I'm having very little trouble adapting to the rebalance but I also feel like everything is taking way too long to kill. Did A Real Blast down in bog town and didn't have much trouble with it but the absurd number of super mutants with much buffed defenses made me go "holy shit this is taking a long time" 
---
Then there's also the fact that as a shotgun/melee build I don't have to worry about ammo. I use one ammo type and if I'm not picking up replacements from Earle or Ops, I'm able to just buy several hundred rounds from player vendors without issue. That's fine for me and all but for a new player? You'll likely be bouncing between guns a bunch since they'll come at different levels and need to be replaced by higher power ones every so often. You're also not intended to do Earle or Ops until 50 (though you of course can try) and even if you did have the caps to buy ammo as you need it there's too many types you'll be swapping between to really know what's most useful to you
---
What was supposed to make the game easier for low levels really does seem to have had the complete opposite effect
---
Pain Train lets me one-shot level 50's via sprint charging. That said I am level 225+ so maybe that's why?
---
I can see what you're saying, but the R91 (real world G3) is a 7.62 weapon, so the .308 is closer than the 10mm. But I like your thinking! Maybe a nail gun (like New Vegas) for a 10mm re-skin...idk
---
Yeah it always seemed like a time waster, the rewards were always very sub par for the effort needed!
---
Shhhhh Bethesda will see this and make it like Nuke Silos where we get shit XP.
---
Level 100 mole rats are no joke.
---
Can’t speak to the specifics of a heavy gunner, but it is much stronger if you wear PA and spec into INT to get the stabilized perk. 
---
Melee is fairly simple. If you’re running bloodied, you will NEED unyielding armor. A full set. Perks like Serendipity, Dodgy, and Lone Wanderer will give you a lot of survivability. You also want as much Agility as possible to keep 100% uptime on Dodgy. 
---
Damage perks are straight forward.
---
Do you if when you upgrade a legendary perk card if it takes up another slot? Or can I have 4 maxed out cards?
---
Just to clarify, you mean the rewards table is the same for each daily ops event?
---
Then the content of this post went completely over your head.
---
I found a bag during the Purveyor sale with a chunk of terrible roll weapons, someone threw their Final Word in for some crazy reason. I've got months of scrip from it but seriously I don't use Heavy and even to me it looks like a decent intro weapon at least.
---
Oh my goodness, you're absolutely right. Everybody should play this game exactly the way you do. I was blind before but I see that now. My humble apologies.
---
Kind of redundant, no? All players over 200 are 5*, etc..,
---
And no one else!
---
Because for a year you could?
---
Replace sneak perks with dodgy, evasive and maybe born survrior is my advice.
---
Ah poo, one star level 50s can be okay for utility, but not really worth the time unless theres nothing else spawned. I wish they would adjust the speed at which public events spawn 🤪
---
What does your build look like? Because unless you're the king of bloodied with the lowest health, a level 40 mole rat should not be able to kill you.
---
It’s fine bro you just gotta adapt /s
---
Play something else. I and another 1st member stopped last season. He stopped really early, I grinded to level 70.
---
For what? 
---
Bad building mechanics, the one or two features you like 'fixed', stupid new difficulty that makes you grind even more?
---
Still no change in daily limits?!?
---
When I realized I was playing world of warcraft I quit. It's not the Fallout or bethesda game of past, it's money grubbing and pathetic.
---
I'd say take a break.
---
Woah, really didn’t expect such an informative response. Thanks a lot!
---
The only thing that’s scary to me is your last sentence. I find exploding enemies always annoying, especially when they’re ranged and charge in as if they were melees... but I already found some ways to deal with them on my second run... and that’s probably my biggest problem. I haven’t done any daily ops yet and haven’t really played since weeks. Not a good combination, especially now with the One Wasteland update.
---
If you follow along the original point you ll see people is telling ypu they are annoyed because the way they play the game is being altered and can change if they enjoy the game they paid or not, they paid the game they were/are enjoying the game, then ypu came and starting explaining people they were having fun the wrong way and they should buy another games
---
But you get reduced exp per kill. I got 65 per blood eagle with 15 intelligence.
---
~~Not Earle, the Wendigos are glowing.  Unless I’ve missed something?~~
---
Edit:  I missed that, huh.  Damn that’s crazy.  Hopefully they fix that.
---
I'm not to sure those were for you lol
---
You are trying to make power armor work at lvl 30?
---
I'm 68, friend and I got the game in the last Amazon sale.
---
Have you considered you're rushing the game in the wrong ways?
---
A ranked up card still only takes one slot. Each higher rank costs more points than the rank below it though. (Level one is 50 points, level 2 is 100 points, etc.)
---
Hey! World's tough out there, don't make it tough inside yourself, too.
---
Alright found him ty
---
uh, sure. I'm on right now. IGN is RuneFox237. You want anything for it? I've got a bunch of chems, stims, and ammo that I'm not really using.
---
I’m really sorry to hear that. I truly hope we can get some sort of hotfix soon!
---
I still don't like how bulky enemies can be but this mostly sums it up. Endgame characters actually have risk in their fights now, but low level characters are getting shafted due to lack of nuance in the scaling changes
---
Instigating and AA are definitely the unsung heroes right now. 
---
My heavy gunners main weapon is an instigating galling and yeah, it just tears things apart. Lvl 100 super mutie.. 1 to 4 shots depending on how well i aim.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Yes. Its the same table for each OP. Just better odds for the rare drop the faster level you complete it.
---
And the salty cry babies who get their workshops raided (as intended as per game mechanics) tell us to play a mode they’re ruining by being bush pussies.
---
Not really, says alot about the games current state if you need a god set to at least remotely get by unscathed.
---
Bloodied build myself and i was looking forward to one wasteland, could tempt my friends to play, but not anymore, there's way to many restrictions/requirements.
---
Fireproof 3 makes you immune to all damage there.
---
Use better food and chems
---
Been using it since i got it, even though the ammo grind has been real with the faster fire rate and all.
---
Just log in every day and do the main faction quest. That's what I did to finish it.
---
Idk how anyone can sneak in all that chaos happening in the burrows.
---
First time doing it, soooooo many robots
---
WITNESS!!!!
---
I hadn't consider that opinion but you're right.  I started playing the game in April (after buying it) and enjoyed the dynamic of it, and dare I say, even the grind.  I was all for making it more challenging but making some weapons useless was a little much and changes what I liked about the game.   I already felt pistols were a waste, I never though so many other weapons would get added to that list.
---
Got several items like this too.  Possibly could be related to the displays themselves being buggy as hell to place on things.
---
Nah, I just want to clean my stash space. IGN: NiNe\_LightNinG
---
You still get tons of ammo back, and you take 50% less durability damage, AND it’s infinite enemies in a small location, so it’s still worth it
---
One Wasteland: Double the Time, Triple the Resources, Half the Fun.
---
And you only get '1' leveled timed run-through (initiate, palidan, elder) chance per day. Not each level.. just one chance to make those levels based one time. After that first run, it will always be lowest chance for rare drops. Unless I read the patch notes wrong. Which could be the case. I'm really not sure with this.
---
I think you might only be able to get the rare awards once per day though, if you achieve the highest rank. Not 100% sure of this, but I didn’t get anything rare on my second completed one today.
---
What is junkies without any addictions? I crafted a regular fixer yesterday and the damage numbers were the same as my junkies fixer, 124. I was disappointed af. It seemed like a bug to me.
---
I just wish they’d join public teams. I mean I am out here trying to invite anyone I see that’s a casual player but none of them join. I mean I understand that many ppl, myself included, were against teams because we were so used to the solo FO games, but I learned that this isn’t a solo game. You need ppl. Oh well, they will either learn that or they will just go back to FO4 or Skyrim.
---
Your build is pretty solid. 
---
Rifleman seems to have taken a pretty big hit with this. I'd suggest using a faster firing instigating weapon like a combat rifle or handmade, or fixer right now.
---
We already do get reduced xp but it’s still worth it
---
"its shit"
---
I've made an effort not to comment since I stopped playing last  season but I can't help myself today.
---
If another player on the fence is asking what they're doing with their life, grinding a broken game no one else likes and plays with them, feels obligated to spend money, it's a part time job?
---
Its WOW, not the fallout you loved.
---
Wheres the story and lore?
---
Its shooting bullet sponges and paying for it.
---
You put into words what I've been struggling to articulate about the things I dislike with the new patch. It's not the difficulty increase or amount of shots it takes to kill things - daily ops are great for ammo and I'm still managing to down enemies without too much trouble. I have a decent shotgun build going and I'm in the 70s level wise so I know it'll get better as I tune things. But man, strolling through the Forest collecting junk and helping out newbies I come across was one of my favorite downtime things to do. Can't really just chill anymore, which I miss. I wish they'd revert the Forest back to a lowbie zone or even just scale up the Bog like crazy or something to still have the big scary end game to work towards. I'd dunno, we'll see what Bethesda does with the tweaks but for now I'm just kinda "meh" about the changes.
---
I feel kinda indifferent. I feel as though at least for stuff like boss mobs or event swith a specific enemy time, people need to optimize to be fully useful. Scorched Queen? Get some Prime weapons out and some armor that lets you take reduced damage from Scorched enemies. 
---
Problem ist hat WE DON'T HAVE THE STASH ROOM TO HOLD ALL THESE FUCKING OPTIONS, BETHESDA.
---
Yeah but my buddy already has a set of the bos uniform, and two vault plans, so I guess you can get them twice?
---
I'm someone who complained and I would love some help. Honestly, maybe some tweaks and adjustments can make this the game I want to play again.
---
Level 37: [Special &amp; Perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4a42a76&amp;d=sb1s00sa0pa0pd2pp0p60pk1pb0p80e40ek0ej1c40c50i10i91i30ij0ic4s70an2ad0ar1l62l00lb0l90&amp;wp=w5)
---
I love playing Intelligence + Sniper, planning when to hit and what angle to provide cover and the advantage of surprise. Switch to mid-ranged rifle when the layout is more dense/tight spaces. Fall back on a shotgun for getting rushed, or a black powder pistol I've renamed "Oh God Oh Fuck" for those do or die moments. By and large though, prefer the first two, so non-auto rifles. I use:
---
Hunting rifle (long scope, marksman)
---
The Fixer
---
Combat shotgun
---
Anti-scorched 10mm
---
Black powder pistol
---
(Considering subbing something for a Karma syringer?)
---
Haven't found any useful legendary so far, or made use of mutations.
---
Ye, my guns seem weaker but I suppose I'm too bad ass as it is
---
Power armor main, still super useful. Im usually too lazy to remove rads untill they reach at least 10% of my hp, which is essentially a passive 10%-15% nerf to my hp at all times.
---
What Rads ensures im always at absolute 100% health.
---
Oh I know, just the look and all I can think of is how bad I want a better skin on that! XD
---
Best part is when you VATS crit them in the face, they explode and their fleshy chunks proceed to shit talk you and talk about how "You missed my heart asshole!" when they're scattered around the room in 20 pieces.
---
I actually miss a lot of the lower level areas. There are a lot of times I don’t feel like being in an intense fight and I just want to farm some resources or ammo without having to fight level 100 enemies right and left.
---
Im currently having the same issue with commander Daguerre as well glad to know its not just me
---
Yes its miserable i agree.. NOTHING wants to die now.. Ammo is used way more then it should have..
---
Everything feels like a miniboss now..
---
Might as well be playing the division.. nothing is stronger then anything anymore.. i might as well just use 1 weapon and grind the rest..
---
Railway rifles never worked properly in the damage range. Broadsiders never did..
---
Pistols didnt get a buff either.. instead they just went ahead and nerfed everything .. JUST Screwed the pooch real hard with the damage... real hard.. now everyones using explosive 2shot legacy guns you cant get anymore to melt the event bosses.. thanks bethesda .. buncha clowns...
---
You don't get it. The game has become a big experience farm with all enemies scaling to your level and you want to go farming to the only place where enemies give REDUCED experience??? Uranium Fever, Collision course, Meditation... Any other event gives you far more experience. Better food and Chems will do better anywhere else too. 
---
The Ops are for farming ammo, like Colossal Problem.
---
In my defense I transferred a legendary I got before the patch from leader of the pack and had a level 10 anti armor hunting rifle.
---
Or the new vegas 9mm smg look, just using 10mm. That would be sweet!
---
Yeah, before i could one shot every mob with a simple instigating shotgun. Now i gotta pump in 3-6 shots into an enemy. Its more challenging. Moved away from bloodied melee build to a bloodied hybrid shotgun heavy build
---
The plans are once per day per character.
---
But you can get legendaries/scrip/treasury notes from the repeatable

---
The real complaint is when they spawn in INSIDE my camp foundation and all I see is their creepy little heads gliding around my floors when they move. Nightmare fuel!
---
Just do the daily ops and you get so many meds, plus all the ammo too
---
I prefer the “take everything you want and leave all your garbage” strategy
---
Oh I know it’s a losing battle. That doesn’t mean the video games aren’t designed badly though. And it is why I’ve failed against microtransactions for a long time (way before this) cause this is the inevitability of MT’s. But yes the cat is out of the bag and unless govt steps in (and why would they for a non necessary product) it’s not going to change.
---
It’s honestly how it should have been all along. I miss my bloodied one shot build but this provides a much needed change and forces you to play smart and use cover. Buffs from food and chems are much more important now as well. I just wish they would have upped the ammo drop rates and reduced the weapon and armor deterioration. I’m burning through resources now.
---
Including the uncommon ones?
---
I got it maxed out and it opens everything and all you need is 1, yes 1 lockpick and it never ever breaks!
---
Well i got no plans
---
lol. Sure.
---
Good for farming ammo, not experience.
---
I started out with 150 Flamer fuel and then ended the daily op with 850 with around 10 stims more than I hade originally
---
The changes, at least as far as I can see, are in line with the core of the gameplay.
---
Multiplayer game makes a balanced open world that any level can find challenging, and encourages, but doesn't require, multiplayer grouping and cooperation.
---
It disincentivises solo play in a multiplayer game and pushes forward the narrative that this is a primarily cooperative multiplayer game.
---
People playing solo are reasonably angry they can't keep playing solo as easily, and are upset(understandably) their playstyle is no longer as acceptable without more significant sacrifice.
---
Again, not a solo game, making changes that make it evident, and encourage group play.
---
That's why I keep saying "the sooner the better" they change back to previous weapon damage. Bethesda is really playing an ugly and dangerous game here with their own customers. It makes me wonder what they will do next. Is this gonna continue? Just because they own the game, they should not abuse their power over their own customers. What we pay for is what we pay for and you should be upset if you are. I am going to give them a week max to change back the weapon stats. If nothing happens, I'm out of the cirkus because this is totally against my principles... 
---
There are simply do's and dont's here in life a.k.a respect.
---
I AGREE. I want this difficulty and I think tha'ts why one of the Lego Perks is ammunition because Bethesda knew we'd burn through our warehouses of ammo with the new update and actually have to worry about scavenging to scrap more like an actual fucking survival game.
---
I get it. If you don’t like the grind, you are free to leave it.
---
Go heavy or go home.
---
You'll be okay, as long as you are cautious.   Don't go bouncing through like you're invincible.
---
Yes, the link has the drops for the repeatable and the drops for each tier. You get a chance at 3 different items from the list when you hit elder.
---
hm, I think I sent you a friend request. It's been so long since I've done that and fallout's UI is kinda trash.
---
Two years of this game shows Bethesda always takes the good things away from me. Dupers naa they get a free pass.
---
The game devs are only pandering to sweats like you. It’s not casual friendly
---
Please, please, PLEASE give a full, well-rounded review on how the walls, roof pieces and...floor?...is there a special floor...?...work when mixed and matched with regular walls and floors. Concrete foundation floors and flat second story floors both!
---
Yeah, I'm not too far from the end. I'm about 3/8 through neighborly with the Settlers, I just want to finish it ASAP. I want a gauss shotgun.
---
Yeah that’s what I’ve been doing but I just wish they implemented a system like that throughout the whole game. Would be nice to be able to get at least a good portion of my ammo back after the SBQ fight for example.
---
I feel you man. I bought the game at launch, I'm a casual player, only level 86. I like to play sneak build and carry a crap load of stuff. I had finally got the high capacity backpack, the Chinese stealth, a legendary fixer and all the perks needed to be a good sneak. I even managed to do my first nuke run (which I happened to do on the day the codes were broken, so when I input the code I wasted my card and sat in silence and sadness for about 2 hrs).
---
I enjoyed going into the different areas and carefully explore places I was too weak to go into. Always gave me a goal to shoot for. I remember going into de Wendigo cave as a level 30 and running back out when a level 50 Wendigo spawned in front of me. I remember running from level 60 scorched at the cranberry bog when I was level 40.  And every time I got frustrated I had the forest to retreat to or challenges in the Ash Heap or the Toxic valley to help me lick my wounds and my pride.
---
Now I'm getting killed by level 50 mole rats during death blossoms. Had it not been for 5 other players who joined in I would have failed it. My fixer is useless now. I get killed by a level 60 bloated ghoul in 2 bitch slaps while wearing my Chinese armor because they detect me really easily. 
---
This is just wrong. I understand the appeal of the challenge for high level players and the accessibility given to new players, but this is so unfair. If the guys in the hundreds are the higher class and the new players are the lower class, One wasteland is punishing the middle class like me really hard. The game has become an unbearable grind and the rewards have not been scaled up.
---
Ironically enough the big bosses are still the same, but I can only go in and kill Earl so many times and getting the same plushy plans. 
---
After all I put up with in this game since launch I had finally reached a point where the game was starting to feel like a fun fallout experience. Now I don't know if I am coming back to it.
---
Maybe MMOGs are not for me, since I don't have the time nor disposition to drop 3000 hours in on them in a span of 23 months.
---
Great piece of advice, but on the opposite end of that spectrum, i hate the trading side. I want to go out and do content and earn my gear even if it's RNG as fuck. Just ....buying a bloodied revolver is boring.
---
It appears to stay one coin
---
Vats gives a temp fixes the rubber banding. I rarely run out of AP because of that luck perk. This works for my shotgun, not sure about the rest
---
Just throwing in that they've said that piercing gaze is just a 100% modifier for the Uplink daily ops type. Meaning other types wont have it 100% of the time.
---
Exactly what plans did he buy?
---
Regular power armor perks cards aren't really useful or necessary outside of crafting/repairing. The new legendary ones are pretty awesome though, but I'm not sure they're worth it if you only have 2 slots for them.
---
Mid level characters were the least tested on the PTS, and there's been alot of feedback post update from people in the same situation, I wouldn't be surprised if they tweaked some stuff in the near future
---
RIP to those players who actually made a business out of selling low level legendaries to new players.
---
Investing in either the Fireproof perk at three ranks or putting a dense mod on your chest armor will completely eliminate damage from normal explosions, including grenades, explosive ammunition ( minus legacy weapons) and exploding enemies.  If you invest in Fireproof, you can opt for an asbestos lining mod on your chest armor and add even more fire resistance and immunity to the cave ins at ACP.
---
Well, for players who are new and only got one character such as myself, I enjoy this update.
---
On daily ops I'll spend 2 bullets on an enemy and loot 20 in return...
---
At the very least they gotta let him out of his cage. Let him walk around the station. Being imprisoned in the same vendor jail cell as the rest is no place for Wallace
---
Eh. Maybe. Maybe not.
---
I have a food/heavy PA hybrid build. It's very far from being optimised but I'm doing just fine with it. 
---
However, I can see (and have seen on the sub) some poorly built builds so, yeah.
---
Why are you trying to insult people?
---
I’m always selling stims, I was farming daily ops today and got over 200 radaway and 100 stim packs, they just way me down XD
---
I have a Limb Damage / Below 50% health shotty, that ...i feel like is bugged because I fucking annihilate everything in the game with it like it's a joke with no shotty perks, and it does this same thing for some mobs. The hleaht just boucnes back bounces back bounces back.
---
Are you sure a marsupial+strange in numbers person can't jump up to it? There's been a lot of camps that lock all their lower doors and with a sprinting start I can just barely clip onto their upper floor and get inside for a bit of a look. If I time it right with floors snapping in I can get to upper floors of buildings that aren't drawn in yet by being in midair before the floor snaps.
---
Sometimes I'll fast travel away and back just to take a look inside a locked building. Depending on the doorway sometimes there is also ways to clip through it even if it is drawn in.
---
Then I loot anything that isn't locked.
---
I'm actually the opposite, the health might bounce a smidge once, but that's it.
---
It looked like that to you because you had a Junkie's weapon equipped while you were looking at other weapons in your inventory. If you equipped that normal Fixer, the damage number would have corrected itself.
---
Well duh its exterminators lmao.
---
\*cries in Melee build\*
---
I like that it's Solo/Group dependent. Resilient solo was great, as a group it's cancer. 
---
Explosive as a group is great, solo it's fucking cancer.
---
T-65 right/left arm, and left leg.
---
Tragic ;w; I accept my fate
---
It absolutely is not. Prior to Wastelanders it was. When Wastelanders was implemented, they fixed unyielding not being a part of the Thorn/Solar armor pool. 
---
It’s on the main page of their patch notes for Wastelanders.
---
&gt;Yeah I grew up in a place with free education. To pass you need a 65 or a D. With the exception of myself and 10 other students in my class, everyone graduated from high school with that kind of grade.
---
Where was that? Your description could be virtually anywhere including the US. It is relatively meaningless anecdotal evidence unless you provide a context. Your description does not seem relevant to the aspect of a free education.
---
Again, many of the independently rated countries that are consistently ranked high, have educational programs that are essentially free to their citizens.
---
So if you don't even make it to initiate the first time, does that count as the timed run through?
---
Yeah the daily ops have a good return rate on ammo, something like that should be implemented through the whole game. I feel like I’m using much more of it now.
---
FUCKING FIRE PROOF, I FORGOT.
---
Thank you so much I'll be on shortly, gt is same a sky username here. I'll send you a message
---
Perk coin farming? I don't think the system works the way you think it does. 
---
Perk coins are per character. Unless you're farming them specific for that Level 10 character, you're wasting your time.
---
I'm not really sure. I think, but like I said, im not really sure
---
That would be nice I just started a new character and I am looking for a spot
---
Has he tried going back to Reg to see if it shows those plans are known?
---
I did read on here somewhere that you have a less then 1% chance to get the outfits on the worst and medium ranks of finishing daily ops. So maybe they should buy a lotto ticket..
---
Your post is the best thing since the patch dropped. Seriously.
---
thanks for the quick response, tested it out right after as well
---
Guessing bloodied or junkie.
---
The content is fun but the damage nerf is awful
---
Well, I probably won't be popular here, but hear me out. If people are just running around killing mobs, the objective won't be completed. To get elder tier rewards, the team needs to act somewhat coordinated. If everyone on the team has already got their daily elder tier achieved or you are solo, then your advice is fine. But if someone joined the ops to actually do the objectives, they will be screwed. I think in daily ops we shouldn't get any XP for killing things, instead get bigger XP for completing it.
---
My rifle does the same. So annoying, a lot of things could be killed a lot faster if the health didn't rubber band back up. I'd also be a lot less annoyed if it just took that much damage and I can't see how much It "would have" taken if it didn't rubber band
---
When I logged on my camp was super buggy, all my crafting table are apart of the walls. The Communist bunker shrank in size.
---
Not yet
---
I think that’s what most people are not realizing though. They say, hey it’s not so bad, just need to hit them one or two more times. Except it’s more like 3-5 more times and against a boss it’s more like 100s of times. Bye bye soloing SBQ with my unarmed. Bye bye soloing Encryptid. That’s still totally doable for commando and heavy gunner. I feel like I’m leeching in boss fights now.
---
Door glitch is definitely still there. Doesn't usually work on solid walls. Sometimes you can glitch through solid walls if you are within interact distance of an object on the other side (like a workbench).
---
Don't put your workbenches against walls/windows if you don't want people inside that part of the building.
---
Jesus fuck i'm the only person wh oenjoyed the robot one lmao. I'm a Strength/Agility/Luck build with an Anti-ARmor Sheepsquatch club. Two heavy attacks killed every robot except protecttrons, and it was easy. I burned through a metric shit ton of stims,b ut I solo'd it....in forty minutes lmao.
---
Either your build is out of whack or you need to get better. Maybe consider Minecraft.
---
I spent around 12-13,000 Atoms to do the full lot.
---
+karma Please don't blow yourself up
---
It should be put out there. Especially since Bethesda has a warped sense of priorities a lot of the time.
---
They want to offer more challenging content and rare rewards for those who are able to complete them
---
Nice. Seems like I'm well on my way then. Gear-wise it's just a matter of chasing those god rolls. Been rolling in Power Armor with emergency protocols for nuke zones/heavy fights, but otherwise going without for the unyielding stats.
---
Thanks!
---
Where the lvl 5 gets more kills than you
---
The legendary perk card for ammo is awesome and I feel your pain with the armor and weapon repairs
---
I would try that just to make sure.  If there’s any chance he bought different plans by mistake it would show that..
---
I run the op to conclusion, when I have teammates running it.
---
But, you can farm it solo to your satisfaction.
---
I feel you I’ve been dying relentlessly basically as a strategy to build stimpak and ammo reserves. Good thing is there’s basically no penalty for dying but it’s still super jarring and tedious.  I will say I enjoy getting better loot and xp for everything, but yeah I just mainly wish that EVERY enemy wasn’t EXACTLY your level and that depending on the area or something they were scaled down a bit or up a bit. Still really enjoying the game tho. I’d recommend just doing the daily challenges when a public party opens up with higher level players and just do not use your stimpaks and go in with a good few throwaway melee weapons so you can still help out but are really only building your ammo reserves and stimpaks.
---
It works on any interactable door anywhere in the game. Handy on the power plant workshops when "Defend: X" event is running and the mobs spawn inside the building with a null aggro radius and just chill inside a massive otherwise inaccessibly building.
---
Also, if there is an interactable object on the other side of the wall/window/door, like a workbench, you can usually phase through the wall by interacting with it.
---
Still cant properly use my favorite weapon the Gauss Rifle with VATS properly, missing 95% shots over and over.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s more than 45 carry weight chief. 15*5 is 75.
---
1wl made me cancel 1st.
---
Absolutely killed my bloodied unarmed build.
---
Yeah it’s a harsh wasteland now
---
I always wanted to but was just too lazy
---
dam lmao
---
I have been wondering for a while why Bethesda didn't just make the game f2p since they have added every single hallmark of a f2p game to the title already. It is only today that I realised that the only reason many people play this game is because of sunk cost fallacy (not everybody mind you). If they actually made the game f2p, people would play it for a week, realise how much of it is a chore, stop playing it and never think about it again.
---
I am a big fallout fan and I desperately WANT to love this game but so many of the design choices make this such an utter chore to play. I just feel like I finished a job at the end of every play session. I still keep coming back though in the hopes that Bethesda will somehow manage to add the fallout charm back to the game.
---
Ew atheist
---
There was mention of the volume in the patch notes I believe but not the actual music
---
What I want to know is how do their gaudy skins work
---
Does having the plan unlock the skin for others of the same weapon? 
---
Can you get the skin by scrapping a crafted one? 
---
Is the skin locked to the weapon, unable to be put on others or replaced at all?
---
I will have him go check, when you point this out, my guess is he bought the SS plans.
---
Yes! All this exactly! I agree 100%!
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5rtV8nDScc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5rtV8nDScc)
---
I mean...he's right
---
Do they though? I TYR's latest video he two-shots a lvl 100 Behemoth with a Black Powder Pistol
---
Uhhh...
---
No. All builds were killed. Bloodied is still the best.
---
How does junkies work
---
Would love to see something like this.  They could even have it so scrip was used to level up the weapon
---
I like to leave stuff in the suit cases, when I come across a plan drop I grab one I don't have and drop my extras
---
Was he using a build?
---
I wouldn't say to go hardcore everything but I do use Nukes and Dragons plus the Weapons wiki page. At the top of this link it shows you what Perks affect what weapon types.  
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_weapons
---
Big same bud.
---
I've hung around for so much broken shit, played since launch. 
---
But I'm done now.
---
Hey, I already was the first person to make a guide to operations, but no one has even read it. I have a step where it says to stick close as the more you have the better. No one ever likes my 6 step plan to iOS runs with ease
---
My shottie is a Bloodied but I never ran the bloodied build, it’s just a great shotgun! Now it can take 6 goes to kill a level 50 but it’s over 100 damage anyway! How does that work?
---
Assaultron's laser and that Brain robot both have their critical systems on the head. I'd imagine those containers are defended very well with metal , while everywhere else is weak because it's not as important. An assaultron needs it's laser, and the brainbots need the brain. 
---
Protectrons are like a body and head together. The head seems to house their scanners and detection equipment which they DESPARATELY need more than arms or legs or lese they're useless. 
---
I just imagine while the head SHOULD be t acritical point, it's where most robots have their most critical systems, so RobCo/Westtek/Watoga made sure to reinforce those locations heavily while not giving a fuck about the body. If a robot is destroyed, you want to salvage those heads....the Assaultron head and laser (we've seen an assaultron can survive with just i's head because of the Wayward Quest line), the brainbots brain since that is literally fucntioning the robot, and the Protectrons scanners and recognition hardware which is hwy there's a bulletproof see through casing there. 
---
Who cares if the torso is shot to hell so long as you can salvage those pieces to rebuild them.
---
For real bruh
---
Incredible op and vault 94 made me nostalgic, but I'm very unhappy with residential being removed from the vault and the interior being moved around. I used to know 94 like the back of my hand now I'm wandering a bit more
---
Is contacting Bethesda really his best bet? If they do reply it’ll likely be a copy paste bullshit reply that’s totally irrelevant.
---
Yes I’m a shotgun guy not a bloodied one I like my health meter full
---
It’s an easy mistake to make.. a friend I play with bought a couple SS mods right at first thinking he was buying armor plans..
---
Reg also has solar armor, Strangler Heart, etc
---
Try putting your camp on a more flat area, it fixed it for me
---
Good luck. My theory because 5 times I skipped and one I didn't that worked is maybe there is a trigger or that it was just public servers were messed up jot sure which fixed it.
---
Sorry you're right. Don't know why I put 45 but point still holds.
---
Have a pity upvote just for the name of the event you did. It's always painful getting such a garbage legendary from something like this.
---
What? Aw man
---
I may be a minority, but as a bloodied build I don't feel that much of a difference. Some enemies take more bullets, but in all I haven't noticed a huge change.
---
That could also be because half the time I forget to re-bloodied myself so I'm used to not doing as much damage as I could be
---
That's because these self entitled babies stunk at 76 before the patch and even more now. This isn't Minecraft folks! Either get good or hit the bricks. Either way, quit complaining.
---
I want 48 additional bars of condition please.
---
Same with me, but in a good way: I had 12 more SPECIAL points to put in whatever I want
---
You haven’t died anywhere or noticed the enemy’s are tougher
---
They had to nerf building... it was too OP
---
You wouldn't have recently reached neighborly status, by chance?
---
What they really need to do is create some sort of premium perk that would help us craft ammo on top of the regular ammo perk. If they did something like that, I think a lot of people would be happy. But you know Bethesda, never thinking about what would be good for us.
---
I believe the lower degradation on armor during the ops is bugged, if a piece breaks and is repaired I believe the 50% slower speed is removed. It’s only happened to me once but when one piece of my armor broke really early on in an op I repaired it and the same piece ended up breaking 3 more times and before the end of it a second piece broke, then within 30 seconds of repairing it while being shot was broken again. Throughout that op no other armor broke but this would need more testing.
---
Just be careful at player camps and owned workshops!
---
Have you tried bulk selling cooked food or raw flux before it expires?
---
Workshop defense events can spawn plenty of meat, or uranium fever gives a lot of glowing meat.
---
Or server hoo until you see an old nuke zone and roam it with green thumb perk.  
---
Combine it with hard bargin.  Still takes some time and doing to clean out the 1400, but alternatives to selling your junk
---
Edit:  purified water, the one that stores 5 &amp; built in actual water, can be a good source of caps too
---
Half the time I was running around with a quad ffr handmade and no damage perks (I think I had bloody mess, can't remember what that loadout looked like). Literally couldn't be bothered to switch off perks until wanting to solo the daily op. It was still killing things pretty quickly without any boosts. It's a good weapon with a good roll, but that isn't enough to make up for a build. The only people who are complaining about damage were either already struggling on the previous game version, or can only comprehend one-shotting everything with their bloodied explosive lasers/bloodied power attack deathclaw gauntlet
---
I agree. I usually run with my Tesla rifle, makes short work of enemies while they are close together in 94. Plus you get more ammo then you started with lol
---
No, each *max level* legendary perk you have.
---
Oh yeah my bow char while is over 150 is complete trash now. My other high level chars are fine. In trying to nerf down bloodied it killed everyone else.
---
Buuuuuuuut! They did say it was to better balance things so I expect a new balance patch pretty soon to help everyone else.
---
How much poison resistance is a worthwhile amount? I looked at that card, but I'm not sure it's worth it.
---
Shouldn't there be a check in the code for it to compare to the last roll so that things aren't exactly the same twice? 
---
For simplicity's sake maybe just check if enemy faction and mutation are the same and reroll if they are since I imagine that has the most impact on if things feel repetitive
---
...no...that's all I have to say
---
Thanks, I most definitely will. But that's half the fun!
---
Same here but it's with a floating piece on my camp
---
I made a post like this yesterday, unarmed got hit hard I'm at almost 1/4 of what I was BUT I was so strong I'm still one shotting everything up to lvl 1o0 super mutants . 
---
This patch made me feel great , I feel so much power. I'm still a tank and move like the wind. 
---
Get those swing speed gauntlets and you don't even think twice.
---
Grognak emotes for everyone!!!
---
Unarmed top tier meta change my mind. 
---
I did actually get rubberbanding today for about 5 minutes but that could've been Internet related idk either way it wasn't a big deal and didn't stress me at all.
---
I'm running a faster fire rate furious gauss shotgun with thorn armour. Trying to get full vanguard. Shotgunner perks, adrenaline, and enforcer. Does the job
---
Its the increased enemy perception sadly otherwise I think Ops could easily solo
---
Adrenal reaction + nerd rage + under 20% health all the time. But its annoying because i get killed all the time now. Just need to get a bloodied gauss shotgun and il be doing 500+ damage
---
That's why I said call if you can, idk if they have a customer service line of what but what would you suggest? I play on ps4 so this issue doesn't arise for me, but I'm sure they would appreciate any better advice.
---
The only place I’ve died more than I thought I would is Daily Ops. Took me a few tries to figure out how to solo it. Other than that, perfectly fine. Enemies take maybe a second or two longer to take down.
---
Anti armor is supposedly better after the patch. But enemies are also stronger, lol. How is your perks looking?
---
^
---
Idc abiut the extra carry Weight i just want the effects
---
My mini guns only weigh a pound. 😈
---
I’m running around with 14 heavy guns currently. Funnest thing I’ve done in the game so far. That and the 50 plasma nades I’m holding onto as well.
---
 BL3  is awesome because it is *and always was* a looter shooter. You get awesome guns, all the time, the combat is fun and fluid.
---
Then you have 76, which is a a looter shooter *which was never designed as one* and it shows.the game was originally an RPG, combat and itemization took  a backseat to the story, exploration and character development.
---
I'm not saying none of that stuff is there in 76 it's just extremely weak and end game has no RPG elements it's just kill this, kill that with all the crappy bland boring combat from 4, minus the cool slow motion shots and tactical time slowing usage of VATS. Most of the weapons suck ass, there's too much RNG and they can spawn with literal useless effects like stalkers melee weapons because the devs are too lazy / incompetent to fix them.
---
Upvoted, commented to see what people have to say.
---
Hey, I run 'Sofia's Brothel' and you, my friend, are in luck! We are looking for enthusiastic go-getters to join our team! We offer a great benefit package and there is plenty of room for 'aggressive expansion'!
---
Sign up today!
---
Yeah I did, could that be the reason?
---
Wait. Scorchbeasts drop enemies now?
---
It's been said before but we need backpack mods for PA like the weapon packs from older games
---
You could even balance it by having it take the same slot as the jetpack - it would also make logical sense imo
---
Don't know why you were down voted, guess everyone wants to be that asshole at endgame events.
---
That's a GD area code! Godspeed in the Wasteland!
---
Yeah, one of the more arbitrary things addressed in update 22. Remember how one out of every few hundred squirrels and fireflies you saw was legendary and dropped you a suppressor's machete? Yeah nah, not anymore
---
Oh yes, it works very well with unarmed. I just love it when it triggers and ghouls learn to fly.
---
I had the same thing happen at Bravo. It was stuck at 40% for 20 minutes, until another teammate spawned in, and it restarted.
---
It was a great Fusion cell farming run, we finally finished it 30+ minutes later, and 1.5k fusion cells richer.
---
Conpletely agree. First time playing since the end of the Legendary Run, and I’m a level ~80 from mainly exploring and building, and use a lot of stealth. Claimed a workshop tonight in the forest and got swarmed by lvl 50 mole rats, and got more of a challenge than I was prepared for. I feel like I need to change everything about the way I play now because I’m too high for easy enemies, but too poor of a player for swarms of max level enemies
---
Fixed it by server hopping.
---
I’m usually on an usually plenty willing on sending nukes, my PSN name is the same as this one.
---
Yes, running solo this way is fine.
---
Not worth getting it tbh, i just pull up the perk window and press 5 and all my lockpick and hack perks are equipped
---
Well, don't trust the numbers either, lol. How much of the HP bar goes down when you try either technique?
---
Where do you buy lunchboxes? I totally missed that one
---
bUt wE pWnEd tHe dIrTy bLoODiEd pLaYeRs...
---
Always take that shot in the dark, just in case you get the real deal and it’s not some foreigner who barely understands English. But I play on Xbox, so I’m not 100% sure what to do. Only thing I an think of is switching the launcher.
---
Haven’t ventured into the legendary perks yet but have cashed a couple in already! Want to plan a bit first! I’m level 140 so will sit and work it out soon :)
---
Unfortunately, rifleman was one of the builds hit the hardest with the patch.
---
But, there's several things I could suggest.. I know it's hard now since you're not at lvl50 yet so you don't have access to all perks, but, you're spreading yourself too thin and picking too many quality of life perks.
---
I know being able to carry more things seems awesome, but it will negatively affect your damage and survivability.. and once you can kill easier and survive easier, you'll have to carry less. 
---
Dump Ironclad, get Blocker in Strength. Blocker straight up negates 45% of enemy melee damage at max lever, which is amazing. Get adrenaline in agility when you can (lvl49 starting out). Max out Tank Killer.. armor penetration is very important for higher level enemies.. which also brings up.. even though more ammo is nice, always pick the armor penetrating clip mods for your guns. Try Lifegiver in Endurance. Charisma, get Lone Wanderer if you play alone, otherwise get some good group perks, and also get Tenderizer and Suppressor in charisma. Tenderizer makes you deal more damage to enemies you attack, and suppressor makes enemies you attack deal less damage to you. 
---
Drop any weapon damage perks that aren't to rifles. get sneak, cover operative, mister sandman, and escape artist in Agility. 
---
In Luck, you'll want bloody mess, starched genes, and class freak.
---
Other cards I see you using like hard bargain, you can swap in when you actually use them at a vendor, but don't keep them equipped always.. it's a waste of a slot.
---
Honestly for max damage but big risk.. bloodied would be the way to go. It's still the most damage output possible in the game. If you'd like an example build I can make one, or if you need any further explanation please let me know. I'll be honest I'm a little toasty right now, but I'm trying my best, lol.
---
Huh. I've never needed bullets less. The daily ops load you the fuck up, I got like 500 plasma cartridges from 3 of em.
---
It would make more sense to have like the automatrons in fo4, that you can make your PA have storage mods. You'd look ridiculous with the backpack on PA, that being said it'd probably be a funny thing to see and I wouldn't even argue it if they let you wear one.
---
The grind from neighborly to ally, is as long as the grind from hostile to neighborly combined, but the status bar is exactly the same size. So, that 200 points you get from importance of communication looks minuscule in comparison to the 6000 you need to grind. All those random events are only worth 20 points, won't even show in that bar.
---
Flair does not check out.
---
Exactly.
---
Awesome thanks.i should have thought of it myself but i was told it had to be a melee weapon.
---
OOF. I forgot that this wasnt the market xD
---
I once killed a legendary level 75 and it dropped A LEVEL 5 WODDEN CHESTPLATE AND IT WAS ONE STAR THE EFFECT WAS UNYIELDING
---
You'll find that if you center on the terminal, you can lock the terminal, then you have to center on the bin to lock the bin. 
---
Both the collectrons and the ammo machine need to locks to secure them completely. I never realized this before today. 
---
Its fucking dumb.
---
My wife and I are around lvl 30 on Xbox and we're seriously considering quiting because it's too much to go and get mobbed by 100 lvl 30 ghouls now. It was fine how it was when we would fuck with a level 60 and get our ass kicked. But now everything kicks our ass.
---
Omfg! Really!? Thankyou! I didn’t see anything about that, I’m going to do that right now lol
---
Using a dense chest armor mod for the exploding enemies mutation is quite helpful. I was right next to every explosion in the DOP and each one did so little damage to me I thought it didn't do any damage at all. Definitely use a dense mod if you use legendaries with explosive effects.
---
Fucking facts right here!! I run a heavy, power armored, plasma caster. VATS sucks right now.
---
Some guy logged just after OP traveled away, his cursing on his mic could be heard from watoga
---
Sorry ps4
---
Not if you have someone who’s got a little radiation on your team sharing it. Iirc, it doesn’t affect them.
---
Then they lose atoms from what I've seen. PC version seems like more trouble than its worth, especially considering the hacked additions.
---
Cool username by the way.
---
Yeah it's still early to know for sure. Wonder if you quit in the middle of it because you know you will not get elder if it'll still count as that first run through
---
I’m running a vanguards build with vampire weapons. I have no issues with dying or damage.
---
Lvl 150 and I can one shot lvl 50s with second level pain train. Lvl 60+ and it's chip damage
---
When Wastelanders was first introduced, the stealth perks got broken by a weird combo of chameleon armor, escape artist, and some other weird shit.. I'm almost wondering if something is going on with that right now, as I've noticed my bloodied commando seems to get detected pretty damn easy right now.
---
Maybe someone should test it out, who isn't me, lol.
---
Or maybe I will, just not tonight.
---
Will it be that everyone will end up with kinda the same build now? I thought Batheseda were trying to avoid that! Most guns are rubbish!
---
Things like this is why I rather solo it, but hey if yall wanna be dum dums Ya Kno. I would have just stayed there too, unless it wasn't too far out of the way
---
Same
---
Don't you love it when you complete a quest and the game dumps a missile launcher and a few missiles and you get the "ugh" sound of your character getting encumbered. 
---
This game is fun to play, but omg the inventory management is constantly relentless.
---
Make Appalachia Great Again
---
Ooohhhhh yeah... PC don’t have it very good on any game, but with 76 the fix is so easy.
---
I solo'ed it in 8:40 with zero deaths and didn't bother to switch out my stealth perks. Stealth VATS crit build using shotguns.
---
The key to this one is that I use Fireproof I guess (take less damage from explosions). The exploding blood eagles barely dented my health.
---
I agree completely, I’ve been replaying with my friends and I was at level 20 and I got on today to see the patch and was pleasantly surprised with the new building items, the season is tolerable and some other things.... Until I went to the Poseidon Energy Plant to do a quick event and got wrecked by scorched and then later ticks at the lumber mill. I used to avoid the bog, Divide or Mire because I was waiting to be a higher level but what’s the point if I’m getting my ass kicked in the Forest by weak enemies
---
I love the update. You must simply look at it from a different perspective. I did a Wendigo Colossus run and someone lvl 415 bloodied shredded through his health and got him to mutate in under 6 minutes. And everyone else there at the event managed to kill him in about 10 minutes. But get this. I'm not a bloodied build or a junkies or melee. I'm a medic build. I have 0 weapon bonus perks. I am doing average damage while everyone else complains. Please, use this time as a way of changing things up. Change your perks and slots a different play style. Bloodied are still good and viable. You just have to know how to act accordingly and always be prepared. I do agree with your comment but again, I personally like it
---
Get an SSD, loading screens are quick
---
Yep. Bloodied or junkies probs gives the highest dps in game.
---
Did it require a legendary module to craft?
---
The rare items (the new plans and bos cosmetic pieces) can only be earned once per rank, per day. 
---
You can technically earn 3 rare things each day (I earned 2 today) but it's highly unlikely given the static percentages. 
---
You can earn as many legendaries as your heart desires though
---
My advice: do the daily ops. I entered with 2500 rounds of ammo, I "wasted" there a lot, and still exited with 3500 rounds in my inventory.
---
I'll come kill you, it's my last achievement for platinum. And I'll pay you to do it lol
---
Yeah again not really what I'm posting about lol. I don't mind soloing stuff if my fucking stimpacks would work
---
Id love to have something to do with my 120 tickets
---
Anyone here play Generation Zero? Around the beginning of the year they released an update that essentially made the game pointless to play. The enemies were so hard to take down that the loot you got from the result wasn't worth the effort. It wasn't hard, just tedious and boring, and you got no reward for your efforts. This change was made because the hard core players whined that the game was too easy, sound familiar?
---
Same thing just happened here, I'm just over level 100 and I haven't seen an enemy under level 50. That's ridiculous, they need to adjust that down a lot. Make the curve logarithmic or something, I like the idea that higher level players see higher level enemies while the low level players SHOULD see low level enemies, but the problem is, they aren't. Low level players are seeing enemies probably 20-30 levels above what they should be seeing, at least I am. The difficulty curve needs to be scaled down quite a bit.
---
The Generation Zero devs heard the players and released a patch that scaled back the difficulty and increased the drop rate of decent loot. Let's hope Bethesda does the same, because like a lot of other people here, I was really enjoying the game until yesterday, now it's just too much effort to keep up with all the needed repairing and ammo gathering. I finished season one with time to spare. Not sure I'm going to finish season two or even play much anymore.
---
Too bad really, I was having a good time.
---
They gone man.
---
Once you run out of ammo/stims and break all your guns bashing you tend to move on to other games with competent devs. 
---
The real nail is going to be the fact this game gets updates very slowly.  Come Back in a month if at all.
---
If you mean armor, go to a market sub. Trades aren't allowed in here. 
---
If you mean hacked clothing items, go to somebody's discord or something. The subs don't allow blatantly hacked items
---
This. It's meant to be a fun activity/challenge for end game, highly geared players that doesn't take hours to enjoy. 
---
So under geared players who refuse to adapt or at least group up with others come to complain. 
---
I hope if anything Bethesda INCREASES the difficulty.
---
Yes!!! It was so much fun!
---
Reminds me of the chaos of the Halloween event.
---
Plus two of us were able to finish it in 13 minutes which don't bad for our second ever Daily Ops event.
---
With the robot one, it took my mom and I more than 30 minutes to beat it and we had another player there.
---
Thanks. And I tried too, used up all my fusion cells on my Tesla gun just trying to tap all the wendigos and hit earle
---
Oh I agree :) I just wish they had left one quiet area like the forest! I’ll take your advice also! I’ll have to have a moment to sit and work out my perks and what will work best now ;)
---
I will miss legendary chickens and opposums, farewell little friends.
---
You get a 10% damage increase for each addiction, up to a max of 50%. The negatives associated with each addiction are very minor and/or not impactful to the overall build. You also need a weapon with the Junkies prefix to take advantage of the damage increase.
---
A little jjmibjab is good fod the jabburwockie.
---
Maybe they trying to get some diversity back in the game? I for one am pretty over seeing the same build type recycled by most people. Obviously it doesn't affect me in any way, but it just reinforces how brain-dead the population is that unless someone gives them a pre-made build they don't know what to do with themselves and just cry on here.
---
Yeah I agree. It’s kind of ridiculous to get spontaneously overloaded when you don giant powered armor that supposedly turns you into an atomic titan. It’d look silly to have a cobbled together backpack sticking out of a PA torso, but surely there is a skin that could make it work, if they insist on making the backpack visible in that case.
---
I feel the same way about under armor. I can see not wearing your armor pieces inside PA, but it’s nonsensical to forbid wearing skintight suits.  I mean, aren’t all of the various BoS underarmors intended to be worn inside power armor, canonically?  It seems like that would be a simple change, and well worth it.
---
If you have ANY armor piece with the 15% damage reduction while blocking trait, or a shotgun with any of the following:  
---
Instigating, Junkie's or Stalkers for primary... or +33% Vats hit, Limb Damage, or Bashing Damage bonuses for secondary effects.. it's considered a magic shotgun.
---
It will do SIGNIFICANTLY more damage in VATS than it should.
---
Bethesda: you will be granted 120 caps 😂😂😂
---
I agree it got more difficult but the fun of games is the difficulty level. The key to remember with this game is its online. You don’t have to solo anything. You work with a team and can still have fun. Get a shotgun while leveling up and use VATs. VATs and Shotguns are incredible. If I was on xbox I would help you two out. I totally understand where you are coming from though because you used to be able to one shot mower things in the game and now you simply can’t do that. Use public teams and find others around your level and work together. As a team anything is possible. I would consider myself a casual player but I have put many hours into this game and am active on Reddit forums learning new things. Don’t quit on a game because it got more difficult, change and adapt to the new damage and learn how to overcome it. It can be done and the game can still be enjoyable. That being said I hope you stick with it and start to enjoy the game once again.
---
It will always craft the same, it's set.
---
Okay thanks, might switch to this, bloodied shotgun is boring now
---
lol melee
---
Is the treasure hunter event happing now? I’m out of town for work and I do t see anything in the Bethesda site outside of the return to meet week event
---
BE demo expert is multiplicative
---
I have a like...75% optimized build (don't have the best gun or armor pieces I want) and while I can still play similarly to they way I did, I sure feel weak, and even getting the gear I need it wouldn't improve me really dramatically.  I've yet to try a Scorch beast or a boss but I have a feeling I'd be pretty useless cause I do kinda sad damage to just basic foes.    
---
I'm really not sure what to do, because I can't really get stronger without just playing an entirely different style, and that wouldn't be as fun for me.
---
*TWENTIE THREE WHOLE DOG?!*
---
Yes after I used the new perks I haven’t died at daily ops but I could if I’m not on point a lot more fun
---
Everybody wang chung tonight. Everybody have fun tonight.
---
Interestingly, this makes the anti armor FFR 50 cal one of the best weapons in the game for full health builds - and you can get one as a guaranteed rewards from Beckett's quest line.
---
Its bugged. There are fixing it!
---
Almost made that mistake today.
---
Or have it start beeping like crazy when you're out of range.  Something.
---
You know any working reputation glitch’s that still work or do I just have to be patient and do it the proper way?
---
God this sounds horrendous with the number of ghouls you have to go through for certain quests.  I guess melee is going to be necessary for the Charleston dmv...
---
Right!! Or 120 card packs.
---
Should have listened to the test people who said repeatedly it was way too much, and fix it BEFORE release.
---
b25 for most dps, concentrated fire is single best perk for damage as you can get 2x damage consistently from headshots and with high perception it's still 95% chance to hit with vats.  Nothing else even comes close.
---
They Destinyed the game. They should have Diabloed it. :(
---
Wodden rolling pines for days.
---
Thanks for the info, I’m aiming to get that bos cosmetics and the weapon plan
---
Vanguard Rifleman Non-Vats, Non-Mutation Semi-Stealth build and I have had absolutely no issues. I might have died a few more times than normal, but I took a little bit of a break so it might be that. I'm probably not a good indicator, though, because my primary weapons are a TSE Gauss and an AAE Laser Rifle, I still absolutely annihilate most things except Earle and the SBQ, but that's working as intended.
---
I sent you a Xbox message might be in your filter
---
I was bitching hard about it yesterday, but I really enjoyed today’s aswell. I think the difficulty spike was just a bit jarring, but after playing all day it seems better. Of course I wont be using my shovel as a main weapon anymore, but bloodied gauss shotgun does the trick
---
Its a visual glitch i think, happend to me.
---
4 of us, i died, respawned during the uplink process, it was frozen at 75% about 30 or so seconds later it was done uplinking
---
When are we getting perk loadouts?
---
It's because its a multi-player game where you can theoretically gain infinite money by grinding.
---
You need money sinks and limits to keep inflation down and this game currently has several ways to delete money from circulation:
---
Player vendor tax
---
Fast Travel
---
Smiley at the wayward
---
We also have a hard cap of 30,000 caps
---
All this is so caps retain some sense of value.
---
I agree that it's annoying that they added it to this game when it wasn't in the previous fallouts, but they have their reasons. (ESO also has this mechanic, they probably just asked zenimax for help with multi-player economies and copied from Eso)
---
You on Xbox? And you don’t have to pay me. I’m cool dying if it’ll help
---
You can also earn nothing with getting Elder rank, it can happen.
---
No worries man. If you are willing to get rid of it it could definitely help me out with the One Wasteland patch lol the game got a little harder for me. Does lmg count as a heavy weapon or a rifle?
---
This sounds interesting how does it work ?
---
One Wasteland - Why are you still playing a game the devs aren't even playing anymore?
---
Nice, on your next character, try a medic/support build like me. If your on xbox I can show you tomorrow of what I have. Or even better I'll get a screenshot of what my perks are. And use the survival stim legendary perk and level it up those stims can save your life, I should know
---
You must have brought shame upon Elder Maxson smh
---
Save everything is that mod.  Get text chat and the expanded radio that replaces classical while you are at it.
---
Bethesda decided to move him and forgot to add it to the patch notes.
---
Yeah LOADS of people have, by the look of it. I hope you find the best perks for your build! :)
---
yeah, justice for those who respecced at least if they played nw
---
Nah, that's dumb.  These devs obviously never played this game from the start.
---
Ps4 too bad I hoped we could help each out
---
Ahahaha. Honestly it was just a bunch of me and a few high levels running around tickling his ass and feet
---
And ticks and radrats and radroches.
---
Are you able to craft any ultracite ammo? You realize that ultracite ammo is in a separate menu from the regular ammo? You have to scroll down to get to the ultracite ammo...
---
I was wondering the same thing
---
I got 2 today, just saying I've heard others not getting any rare drops with even getting Elder rank.
---
If the intent was for adjustments to damage calculation to be a two-step fix then, implementing one-step of the fix (the normalization of how modifiers interact with each other) while not also doing the 2nd step (like, as you mentioned, weapon base damage, change to the perk cards, change to bloodied/junkie/mutants/etc.) is a misstep.
---
And if the concern was they wanted to see how the calculation change affects combat before than making modifier/weapon adjustments, then they probably should have also NOT done the mob scaling at the same time they changed how damage works.
---
I will say that out of the weapons I carry, I now use a different one as my main than I did pre-patch (Junkie 33 Vats Handmade now over my Junkie Fixer).  I feel like that legendary effect is now even more valuable.
---
What's disappointing is the satisfaction level now of things like the Instigating Lever I was using before to 1 shot pop mobs in places like WestTec (even though I'm specced for auto).  I can't imagine how a rifle spec gets any enjoyment out of the current state.
---

When I'm loaded with aid, junk, weapons and armour to scrip I run
---
Travelling pharmacy 3
---
bandolier 2
---
strong back 3
---
bear arms 3
---
Pack rat 3
---
Thru hiker 3
---
Batteries included 3
---
All for weight management

Then when I go to a serious fight I swap my entire strength set out for 
---
blocker 3
---
Heavy gunner 3
---
Expert heavy gunner 3
---
Master heavy gunner 3
---
Faster reload perk 2
---
And my weight goes up to 1500+
---
When I'm not overloaded on junk I drop pack rat and strong back for 2 damage cards
---
That should be around winter time according to their roadmap.
---
You can only get one rare reward from each daily op.
---
Same boat, friend. Used to be able to land 1000+ damage with a headshot using my silenced 3* gauss rifle. Now I’m lucky if I can get 400 damage. AND the mobs seem to take waaaaay more damage. AAANNNDDD they certainly know where I’m at a lot faster. The meantime between hidden and danger is terrifyingly short. 
---
At lvl 133 I don’t feel like trying to slog through a build correction ( just to have it probably end up unviable too). And the considerable time I’ve put into 1 toon, I’ve no interest in rerolling a new toon and slogging through the same old junk.
---
I kinda figured cause I didn’t recognize the term “platinum” lol. Sorry for that!
---
&gt;Do you get the audio cue when
---
Only sometimes, and since it isn't consistent, it's worse than useless.  "That robot isn't making any noise, so it must be ok to loot......BOOM"
---
The volume still fluctuates for me but I barely notice it.
---
I don't know about increasing the difficulty.  Today's was a breeze but yesterday's was a challenge to solo and still tough with a team of 2 1/2(didn't get to solo today's).  I think if some are tougher than others it's fine.  Give solo players a chance to do the manageable ones; but leave the bots/Burrows combo for a challenge.
---
Rad sponge.
---
If a player gains rads from any source no matter how large or small any nearby players will have rads removed equal to the level of the perk card.
---
Yeah, TSE have actually made a bit of a comeback with this patch, and AA is emerging as a pretty good pick, so you're sitting pretty with them, lol.
---
If they need ammo, stims, Junk to help fix things then ask. It’s an online game. I get that ppl want to do it themselves. We were programmed that way with the other fallout games but this one is truly different. You need to rely on each other for help. It’s a grind of a game until you get to level 50 or you finally decide on what kind of builds you want to go with. That’s the biggest hurdle. Finding that build that fits your style. There’s websites designed for helping you build your character before you start and tells you what perks to get when. It’s a great site and it helps a ton. The issue is going in blind and not knowing what to do. If you haven’t been able to hit level 50 then you will struggle but as I said there’s plenty of good ppl in this community that would help out. I am one of them and I know many others that are the same way. We have found our endgame and it’s helping others. I just don’t want to see ppl leave because it gets hard. It’s a game, it’s not suppose to be easy, if it was then they would have a difficulty setting. Teamwork makes it all work in this game. Regardless I look forward to meeting many of you in the wastelands and if you are on PS4 and need help let me know.
---
Yeah I got my ass kicked a few times by level 50 radroaches — wasn’t expecting that. Def made the Forest a little less leisurely.
---
Instigating doesn't even work like it used to. You need to vats crit, head shot, 3.5 sneak multiplier, Instigating lever action to 1 shot lvl 50 supermutants.
---
That actually sucks,  I was about to convert from bloodied to junkies because my junkies rolls are phenomenal, I've got the whole bag and never used them once but for the reasons of the big change up I waited. 
---
I guess this makes the final word much more valuable now too for heavies.
---
Just encase I do make the switch anyway because whats the point in damage if you're not playing with fun weapons . What armour do you run? 
---
Currently play as a zombie build 3 life saviour and revenant i wonder if the buff is actually doing much? 
---
Also I hear a lot of people say the damage numbers we see are "for show" and it doesn't reflect what we're actually doing. I'm not sure about this I just play the game but it could be something? 
---
Good post either way.
---
That's basically what I do now.  If you can't loot the corpse QUICK, leave it alone and come back to it later
---
You can only get them once a day and the chance is 80% on elder
---
Pretty sure you can’t have more than 1 Bobblehead active at a time
---
It's only 1 a day.
---
Thta's outdated. I can buy it at the berkeley springs vendor at level 200 on xbox. If you're on tmr, I can give you the caps.
---
Less when in VATS visually on the bar, takes slightly more rounds as well which is why I'm positive something is up with it. 
---
To be fair to the update and Bethesda's track history of making more bugs than fixes, I'm not overly annoyed about anything, the update is quite nice and I'm loving the content/optimisation coding fixes, just a few little touch ups here and there and she'll be right as rain
---
I’m level 31, almost 32. I’m still around!
---
I was afraid this would happen. I was planning on making A new character just to play through the early game again with this update.
---
Ive been wanted more times today than I have in the past year and a half.
---
So many weird little building glitches can be fixed by doing this. I try to build in private as it seems to have less change of bugging out, but it still happens sometimes. Annoying as.
---
This only applies if your team mates are near you and not sneaking (or your targeted mob is aggro'd to something else). They can be elsewhere on the map and not sneaking and you'd be fine where you are. I don't know if you intended to sound that way?
---
That’s what I like to hear! If you ever need anything and are on PS4 let me know. I will do what I can.
---
From what I’ve heard that’s how it used to be before, but now I see them often in player vendors for 1,000-2,000 caps. I have no idea how much the robots sell it for. Equip hard bargain 3 and take a grape mentat to make buying stuff cheaper.
---
So totally weird tangent: if FO 76 changed the ammo system to something more like Destiny. That would be amazing right?
---
Upvoted for ^savage divide.
---
I’m an old-head, but I absolutely think your perspective should carry some weight. I would hate to be coming in to this game at entry-level right now.
---
Jukeboxes are not radios.
---
I agree. I’m level 159 and am a bloodied heavy build. Combat is more challenging for me which I love but even then I can still mow down enemies and ammo is rarely an issue for me. With that being said, I’m level 159, have a set build, and above all else use legacy heavy weapons which are just incredibly powerful both pre and post nerf. I love one Wasteland, but only in the eyes of me and other high levels with legacies/god roll weapons. I feel sorry for you guys. I really do. And I’m one of the few people with OP builds that won’t whine “you’re just bad lmao gg” or “get a better build”. Yeah this game should be at least somewhat challenging since it’s about surviving a post-apocalyptic world but still not to this extent. Heavy legacies should be nerfed more (yes you read that right from someone who uses them) and rifleman/pistol was already weak in the first place, and not only did they nerf that the lost they of course leveled enemies. My bloodied explosive lever-action rifle for example took a 200-damage hit. Bad move by Bethesda.
---
Until they make pool cues and lasers worthwhile you can't count on the RNG for shit
---
I've been saying this since I started playing... there's SO many prefixes from FO4 they took out that would be awesome in this game.
---
I'm assuming most of it had to do with PVP.
---
Actively asking for an exploit?  Smart
---
What’s your GT? I may be able to try and help craft some things for you both to help you along if you’re interested
---
I just bash em after I shoot em.  Bashing counts as melee.
---
Hey - been there, used to play a ton and wife and I play much more casually now. Even though I’ve got my complaints with the game from time to time, I think if you get over the first 50 levels things will get easier (IMO the update made the game more fun, but for higher levels). 
---
What’s your platform? If you play on Xbox - id love to drop you both some legendaries, some armor, and some supplies. Let me know, my gt is Freestateepp
---
I think you hit a home run with that analogy and I want to add that the one thing they didn't do is toss us a few better bats.  This should have come with a sweeping rebalance of base weapon damage across all weapon types,  but nope.
---
You can only be rewarded the rare once if you complete in under eight minutes. So repeating is good for xp and helping other players and the random legendaries you are awarded
---
Sadly I’m pc, but still enjoying the game, regardless of the update, I was more of a lurker anyways. I’m half way or more on my stealth build.
---
LOL I'm sorry to hear that. When I logged in for the first time today the map was awash in "WANTED" players. Do you have it at max rank, and if so, do you have to press the "E" to steal (or what ever it is on console) or does it do it for you? I'm assuming the latter because of all the RED!
---
It's all just rng. Elder rank has an 80% chance of getting a rare item, not 100%
---
Free Xp, and Free Legendaries! Get your god rolls today!
---
You don’t actually go into the “down but not out” state your health goes to 0 then pops back up the the maximum you can have it and it shows the card pop up on the left so any perks where you go into “down but not out” state most likely won’t work
---
I got a 3 star furious lead pipe. 
---
Honestly at this point I just do the event for the xp and the screws. Besides being a fun event, I stopped caring for what legendary weapons or armor I get. 90% of the time they get dropped or scrapped for script. 
---
I’ve been using the same 4 weapons for about two years now. Whatever legendary weapons I don’t have I give to my gf or our friend.
---
So many!
---
This is a joke, right?
---
Overall, I think it’s great. I am not a really high level at 85, but I still rarely died. I’m a commando luck build with anti armor focus. Unless it was SBQ or imposter sheepsquatch. (still haven’t played Earle) I shredded enemies. Those heart dropping moments were few and far between to where I was already close to being done playing or just making a new character. I like difficulty without feeling punished. I’m an explorer in game and enjoy harvesting resources so the ammo needs don’t bother me. I used to carry just two guns because I never needed more. Now I carry four all with different ammos. 
---
I can definitely see lower levels having issues though. Instead of matching levels, even ten under would be excellent I think. For me, seeing level 70 enemies is a huge improvement over locked 50s. I was building “bad” builds just to screw around and make a fake challenge for myself. Now I don’t have to fake it and I can actually work to make myself better, not worse.  I’m extremely happy with the changes. Doing a wider variety of challenges for fun instead of just grinding fort defiance and A.W.O.L. Over and over again. 
---
Got my shit pushed in with the melee finish bots. Actually broke two guns clearing Grafton steel. Got ambushed and close to killed by “weak” ghouls at VTU. And couldn’t be happier
---
I didn't even know about the patched one until I heard it in the patch notes.
---
At least you got 1. Can confirm that you can get 0 a day. Got elder 3 times with no rare rewards. I was expecting not to get anything rare after the first elder run but damn.. feelsbadman when you wait all day to run your first daily OP and get shafted lol
---
The Gauss Shotgun makes it worse
---
It is a lot of XP and great for repetitive enemies that come to you but as a dedicated EXP build, nothing beats the Burrows per x (time).
---
Ops are great for stimpack &amp; ammo farming absolutely
---
Explosive.
---
Well it definitely made plant gathering WAY more exciting for my lvl 450+ self. Damn lvl 50 mole rats can suck it!
---
I’m sure it’s not the nerf bloodied people who kills the queen who killed it in 15 secs before just will take them a min I just think you had people who didn’t have good dps builds or weapons
---
I mean I would be interested to see how it is. But getting use to pre update and then having to dump all of my ammo into monsters is a bit ridiculous.
---
Ah yes. Yet another complainer. Here is a few tips to change your view.
---
Step 1: Stop fucking complaining. No one wants to here you rant about how Bethesda ruined your builds and experience and enjoyment. Just.... no.
---
Step 2: Look at this as a way of self reflection. Do you really wanna be apart of the norm? Among with the countless other bloodied and junkies and melee builds. That's not a way to live. 
---
Step 3: Look at the perks you have. Now randomize them. Try and come up with a new combination and make a completely different build. Think outside the box. Use your brains.
---
Step 4: Have fun. The community is always here for you. There are factions,roleplay, and hell, even a building community that focuses solely on building C.A.M.P.s  There are so many other things for you to do other rhen complain about your "RUINED ENJOYMENT"
---
Step 5: Dont let this nerf get you down. A few of the nerfs were good. I'm happy to no longer see people one shot bad guys and legendaries  before I can tap them. I know how ya feel. Just come up with a mew way to make your build work. Hell, I did a Wending Prob run and a lvl 415 with a bloodied build made Earl's first heath bar look like a candle that got blown put. He had him mutated in under 6 minutes which is amazing. 
---
Lastly, please try to use my advice and steps. Just breath and relax. It's not the end of the world. Sure enemies are stronger and everything is nerfed but hey, look at the bright side the community is here to support you man.
---
Make sure you stay in a public team. I have been seeing stupid amounts of caps roll in when teammates complete quests.
---
125 caps? What the hell are you guys doing? 😅
---
Im Master Yetti56. My wife is Spoopywaffle
---
It’s part of new patch “One Wasteland” all enemies are scaled to your level 
---
Every enemies is level 50 or higher
---
I’m getting there. 😅 I was vender happy one day and someone was selling really amazing power armor plans for 20 caps...but it’s the rarest ultracite or whichamacall it. So I won’t be making that anytime soon. 🙃
---
yep, knew that, others didn't and were whining. Kinda felt sorry for them, RNJesus can be a bitch sometimes.
---
oh im well over 50. combined i think im around 210? i think? i just know how the grind is now and can look at it the way it would be for a noob
---
Are you referring to just having light/medium/heavy ammo? It might be too simple for some.
---
It's really not that bad, tbh
---
Hmm. I know when you go down but not out, Last Laugh procs. Just needs to be tested.
---
Yes, I got two today
---
true! it's alllllllll endgame now lmao
---
Weapons in general STILL need an overhaul.  That should have never come after a change like this.  At worst the same time, but it's been needed for over a year.
---
I mean i doubt they'll give us combat "pets"  anytime soon. Maybe in a next gen upgrade? but customizing the collectron would be fun.
---
maybe i want a mister handy that "cleans" my camp and collects scrap and auto repairs stuff if possible.  Maybe he can be codsworth cus he was underrated, &lt;3 codsworth.
---
Sad ultracite Armor is nice but you should be able to find a decent set of T45 or T51b or even a set of Excavator
---
I would keep an eye out for a bloodied one, they do 500+ DMG with all relevant perks :)
---
Their is no other half. We are the majority.
---
They kept and keep listening To like you said I am level 207 btw. Ppl with god like characters. And you tubers telling them, knowing the influence they have on Bethesda same goes for some of these redditors, that the game is easy and putting up this videos to force ppl play their styles. In which any case it came to full circle last night. I've been saying this since patch 20 stop listening to the few. Because at the end that's all you going to have just the few that killed your game and they will move on to the next game and do the same thing and ruin everyone else experience..and then make videos of why ppl are hating on the game. SMH. If there wasn't divided, now is most definitely is.
---
Np, glad it helped.  All the items inside have to be placed fresh for them to sit proper.  Good gaming fellow wastelander!
---
We're running the same build even down to the weapons , I haven't tested earle yet since the patch but try getting that jetpack up to his beautiful face and start giving him pats. It normally works for me,  I'm always happy as long as I can see chunks of health leave the boss with each hit.
---
Awwww that's very wholesome and awesome. I'd love to do a run with you sometime if you play xbox. Plus I want a Reclaimed gas mask. I really love them
---
I’ve done earle not the sbq and didn’t have problems with a team of 6. It takes more ammo but hang back and loot the spawns, you get it back.
---
I’m feeling similar to OP. My main is a sniper with an Instigating Explosive Lever (with suppressor) as my primary weapon. I feel like my build with all 3 Rifleman perks maxed, Tank Killer maxed, Bloody Mess maxed, and Covert Operative maxed, should be able to one-shot a non-boss supermutant with a sneak attack headshot, even with a non-legendary rifle. But even with the IE effects, there are very few enemies going down in one shot, sometimes not even if I lead with a Crit strike. And forget my secondary weapons... my AA Handmade feels like it’s shooting blanks.
---
And forget about the Daily Ops where the enemies have super-high perception. No sneak attacks, hardly doing any damage, mobs have no trouble at all targeting me, and I feel like I spend as much time respawning as shooting. Two days in and already it just feels like a grind.
---
I have a sign like that that says "only claimed for the score"
---
I use 3 Life Saving Powered WWR pieces, 2 Auto Stim Powered WWR pieces. Not necessarily for a zombie build, I just believe those are the best effects for a full health build, except just 1 Auto Stim piece and 4 Life Saving pieces would be better. You get diminishing returns with damage resistance, so Vanguard and Bolstering are almost pointless.
---
If you already have the Junkie's weapons, I would recommend going Junkie's. I'm not going to switch, especially since there's a small possibility of this damage nerf being undone, since mid-level players are reporting that it's almost impossible to make it over that difficulty spike that happens around levels 25-35 now that every enemy is scaled. The negative stat effects from withdrawals don't really have a big effect on your character anyway, and being purposely addicted to Psycho gives you an excuse to spam Psychobuff as much as you want.
---
I'm the same. Haven't felt a huge difference like some people are saying
---
I'm only level 29, was in whitesprings just outside the entrance, and got utterly annihilated by some ghouls before I could turn around and react, the robots didn't do much to help. 
---
That was a nice welcome back to the game
---
Lol dude gonna be swol
---
Just started playing around with blight soup and herbivore + eagle eyes, of course now perception is really skewed.  I was doing about 400 dmg crits to SBQ, now down to like 250. Next I guess I have no choice but to fo bloodied.  I dropped psychopath for starched Genes and the one that increases bonblehead/magazine duration.  Over time I've been pushing more and more toward buffs.
---
Fair enough. Although, I’ve noticed that I’ve had my rads fucked over by a teammate in Scorched Earth While I was in the far North.
---
I agree with this
---
Only Uplink DOps are anti-stealth; they’ve said future types won’t be.
---
I appreciated the twenty hours I got but, this isn't my Fallout. Uninstalled and searching for a new time waster before and after my shift. (Open to suggestions)
---
I hope you guys get a great experience in coming fixes and updates but this games just not slapping to me anymore.
---
Wouldnt it be the other way? Cause be is higher damage for one shotting mobs, and b25 better for bosses cause they have explosive resistance?
---
I have been grabbing pieces of the T-45 I believe. I just realized I fudged up and skipped some. Assaultrons make me nervous lol.
---
TBH, more like three months. 🤔
---
Its been 2 damn years, I want them to fix/redo sneak to make it viable to a massively online multiplayer game, instead of the outdated and untuitive mechanics from fallout 4 that don't work in this environment.
---
If I AM in caution, then I should do sneak dmg regardless of if the enemy is aggro'd to someone else.
---
The current game shows dmg numbers equal to sneak dmg even when the enemy is aggro'd, but it isn't reflected in the dmg to the health bar.
---
Sneak dmg has been obsolete within world events since the beginning.
---
Now sneak dmg has become obsolete within solo adventure.
---
And Daily Ops do not allow you to sneak whatsoever.
---
Why bother having a variety of perks, weapons, builds when Bethesda is planning to shoehorn us towards only a couple of viable ways to play the game.
---
O they'll come all right,  they'll come all the way to the atomic shop and you'll gosh darn pay for them !
---
So I should hold off on buying it then? I'm only level 24 so I don't have hard bargain 3 (only have hard bargain 1) or grape mentats (cause I sold them yesterday). They're 2k caps at vendor but if I don't need to buy it right away that'd be awesome.
---
thank you, i thought it was that but the identical enemies made me curious
---
i don’t understand how these changes made it through the pts.
---
It's random.  You're going to eat shit from time to time.
---
Yea I love it. They are extremely bright perfect for the event itself, and I love the fact that it’s a white light. The green pip boy light can get annoying quick. Unfortunately on PS4.
---
Do you run a junkie build?
---
Seriously, I feel like 1 cap a bullet is too cheap. 2 cap at least, y'all gotta make a living.
---
Oh assaultrons are badasses. They kill many ppl.
---
So, I can’t say this with any confidence but if the patch is working correctly If you are seeing people above your level you shouldn’t be there yet
---
I'm level 80 and I agree with a lot of what's being said. I really, really dislike this patch - the game has gone from fun and optionally grindy, to just plain grindy - and tediously so.
---
As an archer build I didn't exactly have it easy to begin with, but I got to a place where I'd maxed out my archery perks and equipment, and my reward for that work was being able to one-shot low level enemies like a bad ass. I felt like Katniss fucking Everdeen whenever I was in the forest.
---
Now I'm having to use several arrows to take out a single mole rat or a "weak" feral ghoul... It feels like such a slog. The gradual progression from weak newbie to battle-hardened badass is one of my favourite elements in an RPG, and now that's been completely ripped out of the game.
---
I'm going to see what they do with the patch going forward. I'll be playing (mainly because of Season 2 and FOMO ffs) but I won't be signing up for Fallout 1st or investing in any Atoms until I can see myself playing long term again. I play games to have fun, not to be frustrated.
---
Lunchboxes :)
---
Watch her health bar while you aren't shooting. If it isn't moving then it's up to you to bring the DPS.
---
Start shooting. If her health bar still isn't moving then you know you're screwed.
---
Do you also have the prime receiver for the plasma gun unlocked from the Queen? If so that's why you can make Ultracite plasma rounds and the OP can't.
---
Did solo today. Was kicked out after the boss when I was looting and cheeked a terminal. Sad. Not terrific.
---
It isn't broken.  I literally did this quest yesterday.  Maybe post a little more information about it.  What part of the quest are you on?  What does the quest *currently* tell you to do?  Are you missing an item needed to move forward? Etc...
---
Ran into my first one today and let me tell you I was **NOT** expecting that welcome party!
---
We'll only get a hotfix if they think it's a problem. And the only way they're gonna think it's a problem is if/when people just don't log in any more.
---
Honestly, for a quick fix, it'd be pretty straightforward: cap the non-horde non-legendary non-boss trash level at 15 in the Forest, 25 in the Heap, 35 in the Valley, 40 in the Divide, 45 in the Mire, and 50 in the Bog. That alone would solve a host of issues and make the game at least moderately manageable until they could come up with a solution they liked better.
---
I guess we'll see. Until then, there's no point in doing more than the dailies on my lunch hour. /shrug
---
I'm level 200 and have 12 of those in my inventory, I don't need more of them lol.
---
Same time all server things reset.  Look at how much time is left on your daily challenges; it's that long.
---
This was my drinking game... loved buzzing just wandering. Now I feel like I'm a hazard to myself and I let others down at events I used to hold chains on.
---
Kinda upset. This game was hitting my Fallout addiction hard.
---
Ah I believe so Idk that's been a long time ago
---
I'm a min-maxed heavy PA build and love helping new players. Since I'm bloodied I always have stimpacks, radaway, radx, and tons of other chems I don't use. I love giving it to lower level players because I hate wasting several hundred stimpacks and other chems by just dropping them. I'm on ps4 aswell.
---
Dude i feel ya, and I'm a fucking medic buikd who deosnt have any weapons damage perks or any stealth. And I honestly dont notice a difference. I feel like I'm doing the same amount of damage as usual.
---
To be perfectly honest, a few people on reddit say that it’s fixed and you can just buy them from certain vendors. While others say the same thing you said, that you can only buy the plan when you’re a certain level. I’d do a little more research and ask around, I don’t want to be wrong and mess up your chance to get it. 
---
In MY case. I bought the plan when I was about level 80 something. Because my friend was selling it. Unfortunately I’m on ps4. So I can’t donate any caps to you , or craft you the handmade. 
---
But maybe somebody else here can help.
---
Excellent list! For the Herbivore Crowd: Brain Bombs give 7 INT with Strange in Numbers for an HOUR and a HALF! Brain Fungus Soup gives 5 INT with Herbivore (and hella easy to make) Cranberry Relish gives 25% XP with Herbivore and SiNs. Wise Mothman Event will get you 5% XP. Thanks for posting this!
---
Be prepared for "i ran it fine with my magic gun and fully optimized build" comments.
---
Just shelve the game and wait for bethesda to get their act together. 
---
It's scary though as they haven't really had their act together since......i dunno
---
I know lol, but it was my first time
---
I’ve recently started dumping excess chems and booze in Port-a-Diner hoppers, especially the one at the Rusty Pick. I figure folks need a little pick-me-up after dealing with Mumbles then missing out on pie.
---
I think it's better to just drop loot bags; more likely someone will find it.  I always drop excess plans after a treasure map bonanza and ammo daily; always hope someone finds it.
---
Haha, your comment just made my day, i can't wait to have it happen in my playthrough tomorrow evening.
---
I wanna start a drinking game where you take a shot anyone compares this to a souls game.  Or mabye shotgun a highlife whenever someone uses warframe as a business model?
---
Yea I might just make the change anyway ,looks like I've got half the gear already anyway why not make it official. I assume its secret service armour too .
---
Thank you! My problem is, I feel like I don't have the cards I'm supposed to at this point, am I doing something wrong? Don't have Blocker for S, only other one I own is Barbarian. Will do for the Adrenaline when I get to that lvl. No lifegiver, other C cards. Any of the rest listed.   
---
To be honest, not even sure I understand the new system, used to older fallout perks. Just been picking what I have. Assuming I'll get them as I level, eventually put together a stable build? And same, I'll probably try tweaking things tomorrow when I'm less toasty/ the daddy-o wears off, lol.
---
Better ammo farm imo
---
U r genius,mate,thanks I'll take it to use
---
Maybe you and everyone else in that server are just terrible? Fought 2 SBQs today and had no issues whatsoever. Btw. It wasn’t a nerf.
---
Basically
---
I had the party time effect from a lunchbox on top of it...it was a BLAST. 
---
heh
---
Guess I’m just gonna have to grind lol
---
Do...both?
---
The first part to gain her trust
---
You can only get 1 reward from each ranch per day, and the percentages are locked for each rank. 
---
You can technically get 3 rare rewards each day, it is highly unlikely. 
---
Once you complete the rank for that daily op, you can't do it again until the next day. 
---
You can run as many daily ops as you want to get a guaranteed legendary reward each time.
---
Lol true, they are just fun imo. But yes you’re farther than I am but wish I knew, it would be cool if some new weapons or camp stuff was available soon through gold
---
The thirties already kinda sucked...they dragged you in the divide and mire without enough perks or gear.  Working my third toon and I'm afraid/excited how tough that stretch will be now.
---
Like the other guy said. You aren't being an asshole and are entitled to your opinion. Games tough, if I was more free timed and felt like I understood builds I would just run the game anyway and cope. Instead I played 76 like I did 3 to 4. "Whats this?". Now I feel like I'm trying and failing to run Torment I in Diablo 3 seasonal.
---
I am right there with ya. The flora is amazing, and the somewhat explosive fauna us amazing as well. Quite elegntif you ask me
---
Can confirm. I’m a b / e / 25 combat shotgun build and I basically stormed in and Terminator’ed the whole damn place. Was able to solo in 7:05. It was so much fun that I just spent like 2hrs helping other people get their Elders status.
---
I use one just fine, it's one of my better guns
---
Ok this is going to sound very specific and is likely not going to be easy to do, but honestly? Try as hard as possible to get a gatling plasma. The ammo is cheap, if you get lucky you can find 3 full plasma cores in an ammo box, and gatling plasmas absolutely shred anything and everything. It has worked incredibly well for me and is making the new patch a much better experience, even though it's still shit.
---
One wasteland is a great idea but they shouldn't have went overboard with it or kept damage stacks multiplictive.
---
Ultracite receiver plans drop from the Queen, or Christmas gifts/Mole Miner Pails. The Prime plans for the Gauss Gatling/shotgun/pistol and the plasma caster does not unlock ultracite ammo crafting for them, That's the problem the OP is having. To unlock 2mm EC and Plasma cartridge Ultracite crafting they need to get the prime receiver plans for the Gauss Rifle and Plasma Gun from the queen.
---
Not so much. I'm level 156, never bought a repair kit. I have some from season 1, and a few from the Queen, but mostly repair by hand. I'm a stealth Commando, full health, and this patch is tough but by no means impossible. I do run through ammo a lot (thank Todd for the ammo factory perk), but it just means that I have to stick up a bit before tackling events. And unless you feel really strongly against teaming up, join a public group. Ask for help. The game's a blast, even with the new patch, but it requires interaction now.
---
Lol, I am a lvl 60 but I'm still relatively new. Only got 1 character. I'm always willing to help supply and arm new players
---
You assume my stuff is secret service? I have a Life Saving Powered WWR secret service torso (for that jetpack), my arms are Life Saving, legs are the two Auto Stim, and the left arm and leg are scout while the right arm and leg are heavy combat.
---
That or if he's so fixated move up to a railway or gauss rifle.
---
I stand with you homie. That's well said.
---
See for me I haven't noticed a big difference, I haven't been all over the map yet to try gulpers and anglers (never could take them down that easy) but level 50 scortched in Morgan Town, 1-2 shots, level 75 charred ferals at one violent night 1-2 shots and level 100 super mutants at West Tek 2-4  and I'm just a simple LA rifle guy. 
---
I will add when the SM started to  mob me I swapped to my tse hm and pumped them full of bullets didn't count but I recon the same as before
---
I really hope so I’m on character 4 2 over 200 1 is almost to 200 and the last I just started again. On my main character I have bought all the weapons and mods and have gotten the ss armor and the others I’ve got power armors and other things so I’m getting pretty bored of the old stuff at this point.
---
Sounds like you're near a spawn point.
---
Not if he hasn't learned the Plasma Gun Prime receiver plans that drop from the Queen.
---
I’m level 380. I have the adrenal mutation and the bloody mess perk. 
---
When I use my bloodied pump shotgun, with all its damage perks and I equip my magic armor, I usually have to shoot a super mutant 1-2 times. 
---
When I take off my armor piece, I have to shoot him about 4 times. 
---
Obviously if I put on sneak 3 and covert training that increases damage while sneaking.
---
Agreed. I have zero interest in abandoning the character/class I just spent 97 levels building up, then slog away at trying to level up more so I can get perk cards to setup a new class/character I have zero interest in playing as.... just so I stand a decent chance at surviving.
---
I already scrapped a bunch of perk cards I wasn't using for the legendaries **before** I jumped into playing and realised everything is all screwed up. I knew damage was getting tweaked. I just didn't think it was going to be so drastic.
---
So even if I wanted to change class to survive, I don't have the perk cards anymore and have to struggle with my shitty Stealth Rifle class to level up and get cards I need.
---
Nothing sounds fun about that at all.
---
Take a look at your other quests.
---
Maybe not quite that. But making ammo much more casual.
---
Can still glitch through a powered door, or wall for that matter
---
Added you both, I’m Zovaax. I won’t be around until tomorrow night but just let me know what weapons you both like to use and I’ll craft some and some ammo for you. The 30-50 range is definitely the hardest part of the game. I struggled with it before the patch, I can only imagine how it is now.
---
Angry Turtle on YouTube calls it a magic effect, check it out.
---
Nakey in the PA
---
I will always turn off any switches I find. Teach you better security.
---
Shotguns are broken in vats. Outside of vats they’re pea shooters
---
Better to just take and leave. I stand right on the edge of each workshop when claiming so that when it’s done I literally take one step and am safe. 
---
I wish there was a relinquish button so we could give it up. As no matter how long you stand there or try to engage us in returning, we never will. Not do we care if it needs to be defended or retook. The notifications of such instances is what annoys me most. 
---
However, to help that I often see how many need to be taken for the challenge...take said amount...then server hop. Especially if I plan to play for a while. Then you don’t have to worry about anything
---
I want a bow stealth guy. No helping that lol. Good thing I have 2 other chars
---
On the flipside of this, last night I saw Scorched Earth popup so I did a quick perk swap, ...and before I could even fast travel there "The Scorchbeast queen's rein of terror has ended!"
---
More turrets maybe? I hear they've leveled up and actually do damage now. Outside of that, moving your camp ):
---
They should just change the forest so Legendaries scale to 50, other enemies have varying scale maybe minimum level 20.
---
No way. I just want to play a stealth bow guy or pistols. Trash now
---
lol i'm getting the 3.0x damage notification popup but doing no damage
---
I have seen this with the sbq before the nerf. I feel it might be a server thing or 3 monkeys typing Shakespeare mixed with Murphys law. You probably just had a bad day and the stars aligned to screw with you
---
I got my ass handed to me when I thought I could just run in and solo it and that lit a fire under my ass to come back and kick ass and that’s what I did I used the new perks changed a few things and I don’t die anymore
---
Yeees! This existing dumb attempt to force people into a daily schedule through psychological manipulation via cooldown mechanics is lame.
---
Same here, high five!
---
I beat yesterday's solo as a stealth rifle build, but I happened to bring power armour and a vampire's .50cal, along with way too many healing items.
---
What i would love to see are more daily ops that favour other builds. Give us one where enemies can't be killed if the player is detected.
---
My quad faster fire rate Tesla rifle I’m trying to get rid of lol
---
Patch 22: eleminates all viable melee builds
---
Also patch 22: Debuts by having a melee based challenge
---
I’m 99% sure I turned Earle into a goo pile today but I was still able to loot him.
---
This is indeed a problem. I know of 2 ways players can do this, so I made solid walls that I convert to door ways to get to the switches.
---
No one had magic weapons or stealth commando builds.
---
happy cake oven! the one thing that brings me joy, my one ray of sunshine in this crappy rust bucket
---
Gotta grow the ranks somehow.
---
Abso fucking lutely same here. I'm level 202, and while I'm not super specced for any build, my full set of buttressed SS Vangaurd armor isn't doing jack shit anymore, nor are any of the legacy/high power weapons I have. This is legitimately the first time I've considered selling all my in game stuff, quitting fo good, and deleting it, considering that the patch sizes keep forcing me to delete other stuff from my hard drive. I get that there should be a challenge, but high and low level areas needed to exist for a reason.
---
I believe it’s available at Vault 79 for gold bullion now.
---
Edit: Apparently it’s not for sale yet, but it will be at some point.
---
It's supposed to be for sale for bullion.  Not sure when/where this will happen though.
---
I normally hit the closest station after each event. I load up as much as I can during events, so I sell everything I'm not going to keep, scrip useless legendaries and scrap all the junk to reduce weight. I'm not going to hit the purveyor until I have at least 500 scrip, so better to hit the stations where I can scrip and sell at once.
---
You have mutations in assuming, one of em I can't remember which, reduces chems by I think %55.
---
Might be my opinion but I personally think they are broken outside vats.  The enemies in general take too long to kill in this game.
---
I’m sad to see the UNY armor trick go,  but goddamn there is so many pros to this update.
---
Dark Matter Fixer, Beckett and Gilbert (My Mirelurk King Pet) are now level 60, Almost maxed out ammo factory and follow through because I’ve been saving perk points and packs for the past 6 months, weapon wall racks work again, and so much more...
---
Now to play for awhile to see how badly this damage nerf hurts my Bloodied Stealth Commando.
---
That’s how they changed it.  From multiplicative to additive. So I can assume you have a base damage of 50.
---
Instead of 164 x 1.20 like it used to be
---
It’s 164 + .2(50) now
---
Do you run both on same toon?
---
Now we just have to hope bethesda actually knows this about their code.(Nothing would surprise me)
---
No, I dont have that one on
---
Good job not looking at the link or understanding the joke.
---
Yea shotguns outside of vats are horrible. Just equip a magic piece of armor and go to town with your shotty
---
No, im a heavy bloodied build and i have no rifle cards and thd fixer slaps
---
If you don't have the mutation I'm thinking of then I don't know.
---
Well, the scorchbeast I goo’d was about 100 feet in the air, which is where the puddle appeared.
---
Nah they should make it a Fallout 1st only perk /s
---
Damn dude, me and an 87 got 9 minutes.
---
I'm old what does slaps mean nowadays?
---
I just transferred 600 pounds of aid items to an alt and another 800 pounds of ammo to another alt using a suitcase tonight. Luckily my drop was waiting for me when I got back both times. Thank you for not taking my stuff.
---
Ouch that’s tuff! I didn’t know that was a thing
---
One Wasteland: You think you can use ammo to get around stupid cap limits, think again!
---
One of two things. Hits extremely hard (damage numbers wise) or is extremely cool. Depends on the context
---
Yea. Not in camps so far for me, just in general. Hope they can work this out soon. I am enjoying the patch other than this.
---
In diablo 3 we make builds after grinding gear. Maxing, stat leveling. You go from level 1 in Normal to level 70 paragon level 100 in Torment VIII with your specially made gear making you two shot enemies that kill you on touch. That's rewarding.
---
This? Is just Point Lookout hillbillies on meth. Ammo runs out faster than AAs in a sega gamegear. Builds break even... fun?
---
It's so bad it's not worth getting, tbh
---
Quick question on your 2nd build specifically... why would you add 5 int via legendary perks on a build that can only take 1?
---
Edit: Also, why would you put 2 points into bandolier instead of bear arms? If you're only carrying 1 weapon and 20k ammo, then yeah sure, it's a better option, but if you're carrying more than 1 heavy and only 2-5k ammo for them each you're far better off with 3 points in bear arms.
---
Yes...hum i think saw some power armor glitch videos related to this on YouTube. I didn't bother watching them as i was actualy trying to figure out how you can go through a locked door, but i guess i'll have to.
---
It'll be in patch 30 😂😂
---
Of a player hasn't placed it down (safe at country fair workshop) its the normal looking thing (white with its level) if its a player item or door it says steal in red. If a player has manually locked a natural door so safe its the first normal  thing but red.
---
It depends on the level.. so a rank 1 card will only auto unlock rank 0 locks and terminals. A rank 4 card will auto unlock all rank 3 locks and terminals.
---
And yea you just press the picklock, hack, steal button and it instantly does it so mo time to cancel whats been done.
---
It's only after the enemy damages you.
---
Taking one for the team only triggers if said enemies attack and deal damage to you
---
I'd like to see the goals all dipped down 30 seconds, but not start until the first objective is initiated. Seems like a fair sacrifice time wise, but it lets you all gather up.
---
Then I would say that fixer would be a double slap then.      I would respect toon to commando or make an alt cuz that would be a fun gun perked out.
---
No!
---
Umm so I didn’t know that staying near the uplink sped it up, but then again I didn’t read the description about the robots to realize that you had to melee then to kill them. (Although I did learn that you could bash with your rifle also) so actually your complaint here is justified and did not fall on deaf ears!  Thank you!
---
I will, it’s just gonna take me awhile to get enough points to level up. I guess I should have said stuck on which to do first
---
Amen. Same I was saying, they only listen to those meta knowing the influence they have and just ruined the game for so many. Spent a year trying to get him right.Level 207. High HP sneak shotgun and commando when needed, with Solar armour I've gotten not even a month ago. I wasn't one shotting most things and or making the game boring for myself and the proof is little over 1900hrs in said game. Only playing this game 24 at times because I enjoyed and love it. Everything has been undone. Truthfully I feel like I've wasted 1900 and not to mention 98%Atom shop items bought. Even after their no real way of earning Atoms anymore. I still pull up my wallet and bought new items coming out.($500or bit more in total)  supporting this game. 
---
What they do? tossed everything to  garbage.
---
Time,money all wasted...
---
Nop restart and I want you to play like the influencers
---
That what they are telling me?
---
I respect that, as i now know how to do it, i will definitely do same. 👌
---
I'm always the target, so it seems to be all right, are you using it?
---
I spend the entire thing dead and actively wishing I was playing something else. Fucking daily ops
---
No.
---
So even at max rank you HAVE to press E?
---
Oh, you said it like it was one or the other. Get nerd rage first but definitely both
---
I encountered a colossus in the wild and had a try at it: I'm unarmed melee, full hp build...
---
With sneak, and power attacks, I did 100 dmg a hit to him, I barely saw its hitpoints decrease.
---
I gave it a few hits, then laughed, and gave him the finger and wandered away, knowing I will never waste time ever again with this sort of shit.
---
Unarmed damage was litterally gutted away by this stupid patch. I observed a 70% decrease in damage. I did report it in the PTS but Bethesda don't give a shit. At this point, I'm quite sure the devs are leaded by a bunch of drunken monkeys...
---
Even if it’s after the enemy does damage to you, I still think it’s worth it. Especially when running the daily op’s because sneaking is useless and you are bombarded by enemies.
---
Tell me about it. Sorry that others can’t just walk around and feel like god in lower level areas and need to work for things now, but there are many of us enjoying things again. This is how the game should have been from day one, IMO.
---
That’s the other one I keep hoping for. It’s a really nice looking weapon. XD
---
Do you have any furniture or workbenches next to your open windows?
---
I haven't even got home to play it yet and I'm scared I'm a pretty casual player cause I don't get to play very often so I just chill and explore and frankly not very good at fighting
---
Yeah it appears to me after just a few hours last night in one wasteland that Bethesda screwed up and used an old build to create .the one wasteland patch. Hunger/thirst seem to be moving faster again.  Weapons and armor seem to be breaking extra fast again and I noticed several other issues that were patched previously.
---
Clever, post it on bethforums plz
---
which one are you currently using?
---
Yeah, "One wasteland" was a mistake.  Hopefully Bethesda can swallow their pride and change it soon.
---
I was in a SBQ today with a good 7 or 8 high level players and it took forever.  Besides the main queen, we had to kill about 6 other SBQs that just showed up, along with all the mobs they spawn.  And so much bullet sponging. It was kinda nutty.
---
I mean from beta until now literally the ONLY downside to a melee build was the fact you have to be up its ass to do dmg to it. Its obvious that the base unarmed damage should have been upgraded as well, and they should additionally make melee dmg cleave nearby enemies or have a perk for cleave damage on multiple targets because thats one of the only ways you CAN balance melee and ranged weapons. In a game like this where ammo grind is like probably half of a ranged characters life, there has to be incentive on both sides. 
---
Ranged characters need range, and suffer from being swarmed. Melee characters thrive in situations where the range has been closed and/or they are overrun by multiple enemies.
---
Thats how it works.
---
Gauss Minigun is hungry, will eat through 2mm.
---
As long as you can keep it fed, it'll be good.
---
For me, I normally use a more ammo efficient weapon for general use, then switch to the gauss minigun for events and harder fights.
---
Which perk?
---
I honestly hope they don’t.  I’m struggling myself but there needs to be a skill gap of some sort. Plus it makes finding decent things that much more rewarding
---
Shotgun club represent.
---
For the vats issue, I found that increasing accuracy to around 60 can almost resolve it, by applying scope mod and refined receiver, you may have a try on it.
---
Nice try, scumbag
---
Hehe. Good one! I just uninstall and cxld subscription to fo1st
---
Don't use switches. Scrap the wire going to the vendors when you want to turn them off, and reconnect them again when you want to turn them back on again.
---
Other players can't mess with wiring.
---
Poison resistance, fire resistance, Electric absorption, and 3 specials
---
Yeah it's honestly not as hard as it seems to level up. I'm honestly upset that you can't use the Legendary Charisma Perk Card to allow you to share more perks. I'd have to respec in order to get the build I want plus perk sharing. Also I already spent 50 Perk Coins on upgrading the Charisma card...
---
My vampire's plasmas approve this comment.   :)
---
I’ve been playing on my lvl 18 pistol character and no offence but I’ve not found it that difficult, I think it’s more just trying to wrap your head around the game in general that takes awhile, trust me it does get better! My advice only get perks that influence the build you’re going for, otherwise you’ll have a load of wasted perk points and spend ages changing them, that’s the mistake I made with my first character
---
I love camp building, honestly one of the best things in the game for me personally. But I rather have then put out another big patch that just focuses on the reoccurring issues, glitches, and bugs that have been around since F4 and from launch of F76. 
---
Honestly would be okay with them take a step back from launching content for a development cycle and just focus on the state of the game. Plenty of game have done this in the past like Rainbow 6 Siege and No Man’s Sky. I think it would be very beneficial for the lifespan of this game.
---
Ain’t it nice when Smarts matter again.
---
It's a feature
---
We probably would have had it longer, but the number of people who posted about the bug was ridiculous.
---
With rifleman at night getting headshots on some enemies does work. The covert operative comes through. If it was like that during the day aswell, I’d let it go lol
---
I haven't noticed too much of a difference and I play stealth 90% of the time.
---
what I did notice is that my unyielding armor/agi bonus is slightly less effective. maybe the sneak perks themselves, too. I suppose they're all additive now.
---
all in all I can sneak about as well as I could prior to patch 22. but my build is 100% focused on sneak- 15 + 15 agility, shielded raider, bird bones, sneak 3, escape artist, shadowed and muffled mods.
---
maybe try chameleon. it's better at keeping you hidden either way.
---
Go into pip boy menu to cut that animation short and you can stim from status menu
---
Ahh okay that may be it, I run a commando build so I’m not sure how melee would be affected overall compared to before the patch, but a proximity change would make sense, stealth was kind of overpowered before so I can see why that would be changed. 
---
Overall though I’m enjoying getting used to the game again. it’s a nice refresher after spending a while always one shotting things and actually getting killed semi frequently again.
---
I remember having a string of fixers drop during fashnact events, sadly the best i got was a nocturnal faster fire rate.
---
How about instead, they i dunno TELL YOU WHAT TO FUCKING DO.
---
And who decides when everyone understands?
---
Its just a bit time consuming is all, no biggie
---
Just gotta wait to join a team.
---
So far it's just been a tank and minimum  offense game. It's gonna be tough if you don't have the perk cards/ proper level/ and stims
---
Radhornet6672 on Xbox.  I can throw you 1,000 rounds or so.  Maybe more if it’s something I have a huge stash of.
---
Can the tesla benefit from commando? If so what mods?
---
I'd like to know your system too. I have an extra power armor taking up too much space :)
---
Idk why you being downvoted because it would be very beneficial to the lifespan of the game.
---
Me and my teammates have a regular thing of blowing up cars whenever possible preferably when one of us are near it so dense torso has been a must for ages lol
---
Also my weapons are mostly explosive and tbh they killed me more times than the enemy did lol
---
That quest is amazing. One of the best in the whole Fallout canon.
---
I spend all afternoon on Tuesday downloading so yesterday was the first day I had to play, after work of course.  My time started off with a SBQ fight to a session in the Ops challenge then right  into fighting Earle and back to Ops.   It was great, on top of that were the daily challenges which I completed by dong all of the above and moved 7 spots up the map.
---
Ass i se that problem solved.
---
Yout item get dtored on a server or What ever, minded for AH.. Every1 that enter the AH get "acces" to the server, to se What there is for sale.
---
Then you can server hop the heck out ur but. But ur items stay in the AH. NOT in Ur inventory.
---
Exactly, it became boring to always use the same weapon an kill enemies in 1 shot. It's the friggin apocalypse, it shouldn't be a walk in the park. This update is the best thing that could happen imo. But some people just like to explore, and run around with an unoptimized build. This suggestion is for those people. And I'm personally much more exited to upgrade my arsenal with new weapons with different legendary combinations every 5 or so lvls,than run around with the same shit for years, God roll or not.
---
I am level 304ish.  If I didn't have a store of Improved Repair Kits, I couldn't make it through a single daily op/silo/big event.  Even with the right perks.  The update has really made durability to me a lot less. I'm thinking of modding my guns to have a higher base durability to give them slightly more duration (thus sacrificing things like VATS AP savings)
---
Totally agree!
---
I'll give it a go, and I'll try different enemies, situations :) Thanks for the input!
---
I can verify they did fix the frame rate drop from enemies killed with teslas.  I used it yesterday in the ops and 0 issues.  I used to grind to a complete halt after just a few enemies killed but now juicy smooth.
---
I started a new character yesterday. New player experience is unchanged as far as I can tell. Beginning quest lines both original and Wastelanders is the same.
---
If you don't have 3 friends, either join an OPs team or start one of your own.  My husband and I wanted to do some runs this morning, started a team since the other was full, and by the time we traveled to the event, two other people had joined us and stuck with us through multiple runs.
---
It is probably already well known on here..
---
But i will say it anyway, for those that might not have figured out how to max out their legendary Perk Cards.
---
If  like me you are a high level and had 100 + unused Perk selections,Just pick any old Perk Card and max it out, then just scrap it = More  Legendary Perk  Coins.
---
This is how i maxed out all my Legendary Perks.
---
Like i said many likely figure this out.But some might not.
---
That sounds pretty cool! For many reasons I'm glad this sub has no images allowed but man i kinda wish i could see your outfit.
---
You have to come to terms with the fact this is no longer a single player experience. The game's environment have to cater to everybody at the same time, not only you. If you could pick your own pace in New Vegas, it doesn't mean you can do the same when a couple dozen people are interacting with the world you are in.
---
To me this is how the game was supposed to be at the launch and I can definitely see how the sudden change of pacing is frustrating to some of us.
---
Extremely important. I’m a sucker when it comes to atom shop wardrobe choices.
---
Majestic!
---
Not much to wonder as they posted in the forum saying they've done that
---
They're not hard even for a stealth build.
---
Just get an anti armor gun and adrenal reaction mutation, you'll be handling everything just fine(you don't need to be a bloody build to have adrenal reaction be useful, its just really nice if you ever go into low health during a fight)
---
They should have actually called "A few days of Meat"
---
I'd really rather they do Mischief night this Halloween than another Meat Week or various Treasure Hunter :c
---
I could see that working, but when your getting hit by an assultron wouldn’t it waste more time?
---
So if I do Initiate first, I get a 5% roll at rare, then do Paladin, get 10% roll chance and extra legendary, then do Elder, get 80% roll, will it work that way? Or is it subtractive so that once you earned something in Initiate, you lose the chance to roll as Paladin and Elder?
---
Can you link it?
---
I'm hoping overtime we will find out if more people post about it, I kinda get that being face-to-face with an enemy without being detected wasn't exactly 'realistic' :)
---
Are you saying they are *unable to do* this?  That's nonsense.  I mean, I don't think they *should* do it. But they absolutely could.
---
Last night, yes.
---
Don't forget that a piece if armor with the 15% less damage while blocking effect turns any shotgun magic with vats. I don't think that's been patched though I haven't gotten to testing it since P22
---
Well if you wanna one shot. Then let others tap enemies first. It's always nice to help out your fellow dwellers and explorers. Like me, I currently have a few low level new friends that roll with me and I let em tap. Like a good player
---
Well, cool.
---
Thats what sucks so much. I though this was going to make it so much easier for newer/ lower-mid level players but instead people who play casually are probably going to find this to be such a grind they give up. I still believe they can find a balance between giving people who want more challenge what they want and people who want the game to go back to the way it was.
---
You're welcome!
---
People keep saying the game needs cap sinks, don't they?
---
You can. But public events would probably be a better way to go. Guaranteed TNs.
---
This patch made any method of armor penetration better. Pre patch bumping your damage was a better way to hit armored targets harder.
---
I think it’s a bad idea. This is a post apocalyptic world. We use caps as currency for god sake. I think the barter system we use now is perfect. Not only that, duped items are going to sell like crazy and go so fast Bethesda will have a tough time stopping it. Also, there are so many items that are worth more than max caps anyway, I wouldn’t want to be limited to 30k.
---
Alternatively, I would support a “for sale” board in each server where people can post up one item like their god rolls and you could contact that person to buy it. Bethesda would need to add an actual trade screen to go along with it but that’s a different conversation.
---
At the end of the day I enjoy having to hunt for those cool items. I don’t like being able to just buy top tier items just because I have the caps. I used to play a lot of WoW so I get where you come from. The AH worked great for WoW because you couldn’t sell bound items. Usually those bound items were the top tier gear that you don’t want injected into the market anyway because people won’t grind for it. The reason this doesn’t work for FO76 is because you can basically trade any gear or weapon with the exception of SS and gauss weapons.
---
Just my opinion...
---
Yeah, 9 perk cards will likely require a noteworthy respec, it’s not nothing. 
---
I just found a quad, 25% fire rate double barrel shotgun that *would have* been super fun to dork around with splattering low level enemies, now it hits like a pea shooter unless I do a full on respec. The ability to goof around was my favorite part of the game and now it’s just not really possible.
---
The only two guns I use are the Vampire Gauss and a variety of shotguns (one after another as they break - ha!).
---
I think it's been disabled due to an exploit?
---
Except that the bunker, fence, tree, tent myth has been busted a thousand times ... I watch her land every time I fight her from my tent, or on the bunker. Multiple times a day, every day.
---
Yep, had someone use it at rad rumble. No lag at all!
---
i dont see why this got downvoted to all hell lol
---
Same here, says unavailable at this time
---
The only thing you can expect from a group of bloodied players at the moment are a lot of salty tears.
---
Luck of the draw and gunsmith is same, you are wasting perk cards.
---
It’s not to bad, pretty self evident what you need to do and how to do it. I went and tried to do my first one solo so I can learn it at my own pace and not screw over the more hardcore guys who know exactly what’s going on. As a casual player with a more casual build I managed to do it in 20 mins for a first time I didn’t think it was to bad, I probably died 10 times, I wasted a lot of time by not realizing that that spawns don’t stop coming, I figured I’d clear a room and move forward but after almost 5 mins of nonstop running and gunning and no end to the enemies I just sprinted to my objectives to complete. The big things I learned from my first go round is: 
---
-you’ve got to constantly be moving forward there is no time to stop and take your bearings you’ve got to keep pushing until it’s done, if you get pinned down it becomes a big waste of time.  
---
-if you’re a stealth build it’s gonna be rough as stealth is completely off the table in these events.
---
- make sure you’re ready for a hell of a fight before you head down, make sure your equipment is repaired and you’ve got a surplus of ammo and meds.
---
-stick together with your team if you have one.
---
It does. My character is brainwashed patriot who fan-girls enclave, vault-tec, government and fancy pre war styled house she owes. So she rocks full set of heavy combat armor with patriotic skin and 10 gallon Stetson-ish cowboy hat. Her appearance deeply based off her character and story
---
Up-voted for truth.

https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4eM5a9X6VmGaV7zz7gYnDy/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-september-2020-updates
---
Bring this brave soldier a medal! No chance I would do that lol.
---
I mean, even the higher damage shotguns I've found usually suck. Any rifle (auto or not) will usually do better and take less shots.
---
Sauce?
---
As far as I understand, you get ONE roll per rank per day towards a reward. If you get elder rank it rolls for a reward from all three levels and then you’re done for the day
---
Unless you're cheesing it with magic, shotguns are mediocre compared to heavy weapons. The most effective non-magic shotgun for dps that I've used is a quad double-barrel, and it has maybe 60% of the sustained dps of final word on a full health build. 
---
I haven't tried out my instigating silenced pump action to see if it can still stealth 1-shot everything, it used to be pretty fun and effective but I have my doubts. 
---
Anyway those are the two best shotguns that I've tried. Honorable mention goes to my anti-armor/fire rate combat shotgun for decent dps and verstility.
---
I haven't tried the gauss but on paper it is not so good. I think there's a bug where it fires really fast when you're in 3rd person though so that might make it competitive.
---
If you're on xbone I can hook you up
---
Have you ever played an EA game? Half the things you can even DO are locked behind in game purchases. That’s not even mentioning how incredibly pay to win it all is. I played Battlefront and Battlefront 2, but I had to put them down because of the ridiculous power imbalance between those that bought and those that didn’t. In Fo76, you don’t need to buy shit. Hell, even the legendary run is free (which is a cool detail). Sure, you can subscribe to Fo1st and get the infinite storage. But it isn’t necessary. Especially if your just a casual player.
---
I’m not following what you mean. When you rank up the special stat legendary perks you get both the increase to the special stat in your status menu, but also get the corresponding amount of perk points to use for perks. 
---
The limit is 15 perk points total, but that is listed.
---
Last night i finally launched my first nuke. The silo was intense. Targeted the fissue site and went to take a photo of my nuke. The whole server was dead by then haha. Just me and my buddy taking on the SBQ. Epic.
---
I think it’s been an excellent patch and breathes much needed fresh air into the game. Sure it’s not fun to lose our godly damage numbers. But the game was waaaay to easy before this patch. Adds a bit more of a challenge and it’s worth while to exploit the lower level regions of the map again.
---
I solo-ed Uranium Fever last night because no one else would join. Never thought I'd see the day where I stepped out of my power armor and immediately ate shit because of some mole miners in Blackwater. Yet here we are
---
For science! Thank you :)
---
Do NOT buy repair/scrap kits for atoms. You’ll be swimming in them soon enough.
---
Doing just fine. Even got elder on daily ops yesterday without dyeing while running at 38 hp.
---
It’s not working because ppl where able to stack the strength bug. So I didn’t ever get to use it yet. And would’ve been pretty cool to stack strength to like 100
---
Yes it is stupidly easy.  
---
I did it in about 10 min. alone with a stupidly unoptimized build, simply by jumping into powerarmor grabbing a random legendary fireaxe and going to town.  
---
HOWEVER!  
---
As someone playing a build which is unarmed, both yesterdays resilient robots and todays exploding humans sucked.  
---
The explosions actually take about 15% of my health, so I suddenly need that Fireproof perk I decided to scrap for legendary coins because I didn't think I would need it.   
---
These daily ops that need specific perks to be viable on specific build, really run counter to the legendary perks because not everyone (Me included) have any idea exactly what the damage of volatile would be like.
---
I hope it’s as simple as that!! I’ll give it a go
---
Thanks for this! I've been using one for a bit but never thought of doing that!
---
When I would hit max caps I used to head to enclave and buy a serum.  Now that I have em all when I get max I head to a lowbie's camp and buy some of their overpriced items.  I remember starting out and seeing the value listed on items and would price them 10 caps lower thinking I was giving a helluva deal to people.  LOL
---
I probably should have clarified that a bit.  I plan the perks out enough that I get the basic bonuses.  I prefer to avoid PA, and like a stealth rifleman build.  So I have all of the rifleman perks, the ammosmith perks, and I try and build up my sneak attack multiplier.  I've been dumping more points in to strength because it seems like melee builds are more effective (maybe because my rifles are garbage, and I have a decent 2\* bloodied axe). 
---
To me, it seems like this patch was designed to make it more challenging for the super high levels who have done everything, while not making it too hard for the newer players, and I totally get the need for that.  I'm just hoping that when I get back in to the quests, i'm able to complete them without using 2k rounds of ammo and a dozen stimpaks (but you can guarantee that i will be going in to those battles with that much).
---
Not everyone plays the same way.  Not everyone is really knowledgeable about the game.  Not everyone wants to play in a group.  I think it can be BOTH ok for you and not ok for other people.
---
I will eventually, but it’s reached backlog status. If only it had better player housing than putting a couple of decorations on the walls!
---
(Edited to add content, because the above doesn’t contribute to the discussion.)
---
I think one of the things that makes Borderlands easier for me, by far, is that you can regenerate both health and ammo. Shields help, too. But if F76 had the equivalent of Dr. Zed’s and Marcus’ Munitions vending machines at the same low cost, it would be a much more satisfying game because the grind for ammo and stimpaks would be gone. Nothing in Borderlands ever feels grindy; even Warrior runs (or insert favorite piñata here) are fun because you know at the end there’s going to be a lootsplosion of Extraordinary Magnitude. So maybe I should have phrased it, “Combat in Borderlands 3 is much *more rewarding* so it feels like less of a chore, but I’ve burned out after 2000+ hours over the course of 4 games.”
---
Me too.
---
I still think our bloodied Sniper build is viable in this game.
---
Luckily having 400 levels i can quickly swap out my build to Tank/heavy weapon build.Which looks like i will be using a little bit more.
---
Kind of funny that my old antiquated bloodied black piple Rifle is the only weapon that can take out most what were once low level enemies in one shot.
---
Just no good for Hordes.Reload takes time.
---
Meant 3 points total, not 3x3
---
It was disable yesterday at reset because of a bug that allowed you to stack the buff indefinitely.
---
Alright whatever, have a good one. Bye
---
Yes, especially during events with sbq and earl. I have solid pc machine and never had problems before.
---
What’s the special circumstance today and what mob type is it?
---
I will see what I have.  I’m on most evenings.  I’m near my cap limit and am too lazy to deal with the bullshit ammo converter
---
Hmmm bound items in FO76 could be awsome. That could prevent ppl from duping.
---
Paired with taking one for the team, this would be amazing usefull! Not only are you tanking, but youd be applying a constant debuff to the enemies.
---
100%. I couldn't agree more.
---
Ppl freaking out because last week the didn’t mention legendary perks they thought they would be delayed then. So don’t freak out just wait and see.
---
yes, you missed the part where Steel Dawn is months away from the game.
---
That’s where I’m at. I haven’t done a Queen or Early fight since the nerfbuff, and I’m not really looking forward to it.
---
Despite how my post may come across, I do have faith for Bethesda to make more balance changes. I just hope it’s not pushed back too far
---
Luckily I got an uber melee build so the bullet sponge effects me very little. I have noticed that almost everything takes a solid crit for me and doesn't die instantly as they did, even the under level 65 creatures. Thank god for adrenaline rush.
---
Heh, not really much strategy.  If you can get in a party with 3 other people who stand by the signal booster you should get it done in 8 min unless there's a shitty mod for the monsters like resilient.
---
I will. Thanks for the redirect.
---
They have not fixed it. They are still “looking into it” according to a more recent post since patch 22. 
---
I would recommend dodging the 15 min play window around 12pm when challenges change.
---
Wise Man once said "Careful what you wish for."
---
Floating Walls,damage Nerf, etc.
---
I'm trying to be in a situation where I pretty much never have to repair my guns. If I adjusted where would you suggest I put those points in this particular kind of build?
---
Sure thing. I waited till the daily reset at noon. 
---
Here are my perks, my legendary perks, and my main melee and ranged weapons. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/eqUeabY
---
Nothing is optimized. I build my character to make aspects of the game easier to deal with, rather then push it all in one direction.
---
And consider this. before the legendary perks came out, it was even less optimized. I took strength so I could have up some of the perks. 
---
And looking at this now. I see that I have two Slugger perks at rank 2. That gives me 30% increase of 2handed melee damage. Well that 4 ranks for what I could get with 3 ranks. So going to change that.
---
Yes, good idea
---
I always appreciate character lore for peoples 76 characters. It has a slight effect on what I do in game, he was a dork pre and post war so he has a lot of flashy outfits to make himself look cooler to other survivors and likes to think it "intimidates" wasteland creatures.
---
At this rate, I'm convinced we're never going to get loadouts.
---
That’s a very good point! Having to spend time getting increasingly more ammo and stimpaks isn’t a challenge, it’s a grind! (Unless you’re being sarcastic. It’s hard to tell with a name like that.)
---
Meh, it's only been out two days.  Give folks a chance to figure it out.  And since the ops can be elder'd with just you and one other running it efficiently don't worry about what others are doing for less headaches.  Simply add friend of those you find top notch and try to hook up with them on later days.
---
Civil war suiit and black rimmed glasses - my main's got a vintage Doctor Who vibe going on.
---
Or a nice set of shadowed sturdy/heavy combat armour over BOS underarmour - with deathclaw gauntlet and optional splashes of gore - for when she's feeling killy 😈
---
I just keep having these nightmares.. floating in space forever. Just... why.
---
The problem was the robots would stand away from the booster, so youd have to go run up and bash them and slow down the progress, but then more show up.  Really it was just wiser to stand there and take the damage, but that seems like a bad design to me.  The explosive one was fun though.
---
Hey man! I was having huge troublevtil i figured some stuff out yesterday. Do you have chameleon mutation and/or a piece of armor with cham? In addition do you use escape artist?
---
I posted my build and gear to the boys on r/fo76builds and it turns out the cham armor was interferring with escape artist. Changed one armor piece and now I am shadow night and death! :D
---
No fractured steel Is monts Away steel dawn is set to release with one wasteland for all
---
If only I was bloodied. I'm just using regular old two shot lever and two shot hunting. My build worked fine before the update, non bloodied non auto after the update got a good kick in the teeth.
---
yess I loved the inside of the vault!
---
Since my bloodied build sort of counts on attracting aggro, I would love a perk that guaranteed that.
---
I think if they made crafting ammo easier for Lower levels, and just removed the breaking armor and weapons, or severely limited it, though I know it’s a cash cow for them for repair kits, that would help everyone’s grind issues
---
or just calm down as it's not a rush and some people have already got their rank reward, you only get one rank reward per day so doing them multiple times and getting elder rank each time is kinda useless. after you get the elder rank that day the daily op is basically an ammo run. Sorry to burst your bubble but getting to elder each time isn't really necessary.
---
Yeah it's a lot more, you really have to have a careful selection of damage mitigating perks and keep psychotats or medx on the wheel. It's also taught me to really appreciate solid cover, lol.
---
Check the fallout 76 website
---
I haven’t done enough experimenting yet but I feel like they may have made stealth additive rather than multiplicative. This is especially the case since the stealth perk cards would be overpowered in the context of other perk cards if it remained multiplicative.
---
Yeah that's not broken at all
---
Eh...
---
I feel like 2 Handed melee weapons should get something like this since they generate a lot of noise. Like call it Herder or something.
---
It’s it kinda crappy. I’m a higher level then you had to do go through far more perk points. I’d recommend picking a bunch of adrenaline or whatever 5 rank perk and combine them all and then destroy them all. Took me about 30-40 mins for like 200+ perk points, plus all my usual less perks I never use. 
---
The time spent was worth it cuz my special stat cards have been heavily reduced.
---
I guess I misinterpreted your comment, and you weren't talking about me specifically, as I'm being downvoted. But even though yes, you shouldn't be having trouble as a lvl 50, i still see many posts on reddit of lvl 70+ people who apparently get shredded by some mole rat or radroach.
---
Ooh both sounds pretty cool!
---
I'd honestly like a whole new event, but I did enjoy mischief night, and will be happy to play it again.    
---
Trick or treating somehow would be fun.  Would also like to see a weapon that uses Earls scare move drop.  Spoopy gun.
---
New guns and armor on the road map!
---
1911 please! 
---
Might be time to start saving up those legendary modules!
---
That’s epic. My gal was born in the vault, she’s in her somewhat 20s so basically that’s why she loves all that government, vault-tec and ‘MURICA stuff. She was raised in it after all :,)
---
Dude it says November/December.

---
Always... Has happened twice now if you include today..
---
How would I reply with a picture?
---
well, a gauss shotgun can get up there
---
Are there supposed to be waypoints to guide you? I got dropped in, he tells me to repair a signal repeater, but after fighting my way through the entire vault twice I never saw any sign of one. I was also getting a ton of lag/ping issues like I have never experienced before any time it would spawn a new set of enemies. Lots of teleporting and delayed explosions. Was a shitshow.
---
There are many things Bethesda needs to do. Basic d fundamental failsafes to ensuring you have all your earned perk coins per level. Having modern systems to make the UI easier to navigate, etc.
---
The game is running on an incredibly dated engine and I feel like they will never move past many of these things unless they fix that first.
---
Same. During the Op I had Blood Eagles exploding right in my face. It tickled.
---
Should be one hour after the daily challenge reset. So in about 30 minutes. I think they plan on making it at the same time as the daily challenges reset (saw someone else mentioning it in another post about this).
---
More players speed it up.
---
I hope they leave it alone too, the game feels more interesting now that I have to actually worry about getting killed instead of just one shotting everything with a random barely aimed shot
---
Nice. Doing it right. I found the robot op comically hard on my bloodied toon but I take that in my stride. I'm just poking fun at the people that seem incapable, one way or the other.
---
If I would have to research all mechanics in this game before I do anything I’d still be in Vault 76...
---
No, these are just one-off unique variants of their parent weapons. As such, no legendary versions will drop.
---
It’s just more challenging now. Rifleman or commando bloodied/junkies still reign supreme in my opinion.
---
It’s a good question. I haven’t seen anyone complaining but it probably is still broken lol
---
I have to leave stuff in suitcases because I can't fast travel. You can't have my legendaries or ammo, but take my chems, junk and aid items. Really wish they'd just remove the cap limit and let me sell it all to the vendor and give out free what I want to leave. But what you gonna do.
---
This
---
That is true.
---
Oh helllllllll no
---
There is only uplink. Just 3 maps. So far.
---
I don't get enough game time in to pile up too many.  I log in for an hour or two after work and try to do some of the daily quests.
---
But a bloodied handmade would mop that group of mobs up quicker becaus it has a better dps
---
Ohh, thanks for the help!
---
Yes, you may get nothing
---
No. Just... no...
---
When do the ops refresh?
---
They didn't buff the rifle, but whatever changed in this patch has meant that you can actually use them to kill leveled enemies. It's still not ideal, but they are at least usable. Previously I used one for thematic purposes only, but I'm actually using it to kill things now, so there is that.
---
Stealth and stealth crits, do not seem to be working properly to me.
---
400+ dcg build here. Lots of experience with it.  Tested it with a bunch of queens last couple days.
---
Didnt they say how they wanted to make respecing an actual system at some point
---
this is false info , it may have used to be like this a long time ago but i shared lvl 3 animal friedn with my lvl 4   mule xbox character and they could tame whatever
---
This. They want it to be easy without putting in any of the work.
---
I did. I'm literally looking at the website right now.
---
Sorry dude just realised I asked you this already lol
---
Yep.  I do that a little, but I've still got a few PA plans and about half of the serums left to buy before I can be a true philanthropist.
---
I'm a full grown man and my character is a girl who gets all the cool accessories and outfits. Fight me.
---
Adrenalin?
---
Daily ops are fun and ACP is also quite challenging. You can give it a try
---
if you turn on damage numbers you'll see how much your shots do, and the colossus has \~30K hp
---
probably it...
---
a lot of projectiles, silenced, and firing FASTTTT
---
Someone dropped a Nuke directly on my camp just the other day.
---
If you need more AP I would change from Luck of the draw to action boy/girl. That will also supply Dodgy in combination with The Kinetic Dynamo. I also run heavy PA and I'm not using gunsmith anymore. Weapons are easy to maintain so I maxed out Tenderizer and glow sight. Those 5 perk cards can be invested in more damage, not logistics. At least that's my perspective.
---
I've actually pretty much settled on teslas for my main at this point, partly because I got a good one from murgh during the sale, and partly because levers are a bit of a joke now.
---
i love my ranged weapon, but yes, going to have to start looking for something better. There's some weapons you buy with gold that I should check out. I did the plasma caster, and second time got the weapon of some peoples dreams, B2525. But that's not me. 
---
But you know what. That's part of the fun of the game for me. Finding and earning better gear just from playing.
---
I’m killing weak mobs in one shot with my rifleman weapons. I don’t see why they need to buff them. 
---
Rifleman is more for ammo conservation where as auto is more dps.
---
Good to see a positive post about one wasteland. My stealth vats archer and I are having great fun. I carry a vanilla fixer for running through whitesprings and have had no issues. Have an up vote.
---
YES PLEASE many of those rooms are useless right now!
---
I don't have a build that I'm going for. I still feel like I'm completely new to the game, I don't want to have to pick a build and focus on it yet. I just want to explore and occasionally shoot stuff. 
---
While the combat in FO4 was a good leap beyond the previous games, it never seemed like the primary thing that made fallout games interesting. If it's where they're putting the bulk of their focus for 76 in the future, then I guess it's not the game for me.
---
I guess Bombs Drop is meant to be the replacement. Kind of disappointing...
---
We're investigating this bug right now. OP did you happen to purchase levels?
---
That would be so cool if there was a command button on your camp unit to "repair all" or something. That would be so great.
---
I'm guessing people are doing daily/weekly and the new Daily Ops instead of nuking.
---
Angry Turtle has a video up on how you can fire very quickly in third-person when using the gauss shotgun.
---
Same here... But then i could transfer it to some caps instead. If i need it
---
Yes. But Charisma is sort of unique. 
---
At 3 Charisma you can share a rank 1 perk with all members in your team. At 6 Charisma two rank 1 perks or one rank 2 perk, etc. all the way to rank 5 perks at 15 Charisma.
---
So I assumed by getting 3 Charisma through Legendary Charisma, I would be able to share a perk. That is not the case though.
---
Me too. So annoying.
---
I agree, it was overpowered! Time will tell I guess, thanks for the input 🙂
---
Angry Turtle summed it up nicely, but basically for all legendary perk cards _except_ Charisma:  if you are below the 15 cap, adding 1 legendary perk add 1 extra slot for an (ordinary) perk card. Legendary Charisma perk only ups your charisma (no additional charisma slots)  can't remember if it ups the number of perks you can share.
---
Personally I think this is their best take on a dungeon yet, and I find them to be an enjoyable little bit of group content.
---
I think they just need to improve vendors info gump.  I prefer vendors over a central spot cause you get to see all the cool builds and go to map spots you might not have very often otherwise.
---
Where’s my Halloween event Bethesda?
---
I'm just hoping for a new dedicated sniper, all the current ones are fallout 4 ports and the majority are like the combat rifle where you can stick a scope and long barrel on it but it hits like water
---
Yeah, would be the case, I was in VATS when this happened. So I'll have to be careful when doing it in the future...
---
 Thanks; I'll give it a go.
---
Brilliant observation! If you enjoyed doing stuff like this you should come join the datamining discord. We have talks about things like this all the time!
---
302 for crits before 204 is highest i got since. But it was funnnnnnnnn :))

---
I turned in all but 15(about 110). Happy with my build, but saved 15 ya never know points.
---
"Live and let live, unless they don't let live, then... They die."
---
Yes, when I went through there were way points to the objectives that were pretty easy to follow(as a solo player I never had the guts to try the raid out when it was available so I didn’t know the layout of the vault at all). I didn’t have any lag problems or anything like that.
---
lol I havent placed it yet but I heard you could stack 100 strength from it.
---
I carry a legendary switchblade on me that I haven't once used just to complete the ensemble.
---
I see your point but I’m only dealing 400 damage a shot while someone with commando can deal 200 damage a shot and fire much quicker and kill someone way faster. And with the brick walls that are the enemies post patch they don’t die in one shot to a headshot.
---
Would be nice but I doubt it will happen. Just use the flamer break everything fully then repair all from the camp unit.
---
Meat time
---
Well I just tried to go from crater to Watoga and it asks for 59 caps so no I don't think this is a thing. (pc)
---
Well, you could just bash them when they're down, you don't need an actual melee weapon
---
and you won’t be, and you shouldn’t be. the math was broken. There was no need to gather supplies. Everything was too easy, even for bad builds
---
Any game that keeps me coming back for 2 years is an amazing game...its buggy as hell, but i love it.  I know it. It just works.
---
They should just reset everything with the server clock reset, so when the daily reset so does our caps, scrip, gold... as well
---
If you know Bethesda they never revert but instead dig a deeper hole which sometimes ends up working, I didn’t like the update at first but it is growing on me.
---
All one needs to do to be a good teammate for ops is stand by the booster.  Don't even worry about killing stuff till you hit the final room, because it's pointless, unless you are just collecting ammo/xp.
---
I would also like an option to smash the settler wanderers guitar over a rock. That or buy her new sheet music.
---
Lots of confusion about this but this is the correct answer. There a lot of reasons and ways to get above 15 strength but you can never have more than 15 perk points allotted
---
I got so tired of daily grinds during the last update. I kept going to the same 5 locations, doing the same 5 tasks, and waiting for someone to buy shit from my store.
---
Im a huge fallout fan, been with them since my dad bought me fallout 2 for my old E Machines PC, but the constant, pointless "kill 3 legendary enemies" or "sell or buy 5 items from another player" got old.
---
There's only so many times I can run the same nuke bunker, or find a weapon case for Sofia, before I just blow out and give up
---
Look on the bright side! Not the nuke side, the actual er, bright side.
---
*plays guitar riff.*
---
Don’t know about this but I’m so mad that they fixed the autocomplete bug for the Vital Equipment. Now I have to actually go and find the equipment MYSELF. :(
---
My Bloodied Gauss mini went from 407 with adrenal reaction, all HG perks, bloody mess and nerd rage to 224 😞. I can get it a bit higher if I equip demo expert but it’s still noticeably weaker.
---
&gt;I carry a vanilla fixer for running through whitesprings and have had no issues.
---
This is what I am talking about.   It's entire possibly to play this game just fine without god tier weapons and no meta build if you invest your perk points properly.
---
These people struggling- I am thinking that their build must really suck. I mean I hate to sound rude or whatever, but I don't know any other way to say it.
---
LOL, I would give you some coin or something but I am too cheap, but you get my up vote.
---
I hate her. And now I hate you too ((((((( (JK ofc)
---
is the junkies exp gat a gun or legacy?
---
I had not seen this yet - definitely good news. Certainly better than some of their original messaging. The only concern I have is the original article oddly just quotes "99 percent": 
---
&gt;Ryan also said that of the thousands of games tested for PS4 backwards compatibility, “99 percent” can be played on the next console. 
---
So to me, he is saying "of the games we've tested - almost all of them work". But 'can be played' and 'will be available to be played at launch' are two different things. I wish they provided more of a quote from Ryan.
---
Again, though, it is certainly encouraging. I just wish Sony would be more clear. The best would just be a list and dates - "The following games can be played on launch". If they don't want to give is a list, I wish they would tell us more directly what their backwards compatibility plan is. Something like "We've committed to ensuring the top 500 games available (based on numbers downloaded) in the PS store will function day one on PS5. We will continue to expand this library as quickly as possible, with a current plan of the top 1000 by mid 2021, and the top 2000 by the end of next year."
---
Well they're not going to leave it alone. They didn't mention One Wasteland, but in the context of the damage modifier adjustment what we have now is a new baseline, that makes *" the resulting damage much more predictable and allow for future improvements "*. So what we have now is a new baseline, that is going to be tuned and balanced.
---
I think some tuning to enemy scaling is needed (there's a good post in Hot about the enemy HP vs weapon level damage curve) as people leveling characters seem to be struggling a lot, especially in the 20-30 range.
---
It hasn't really impacted me much as I was spending 80% of my time in PA anyway, but now I just need to use it in The Forest as well. All in all I like it.
---
Level 390, I scrapped all of my banked levels. As well as 98% of my non build cards
---
I've been so set with my build for forever now I wouldn't change it haha
---
The biggest pitfall I see people trip on is their overall priority. I've gotten &lt;6min with three people, when everyone focuses, but I've seen a lot of people get bogged down fighting, especially against resilient bots. 
---
The key is to COMPLETELY IGNORE ENEMIES until you get to the uplink boost phase, then move constantly, minimizing engagement while staying within the boost circle. People get stuck fighting and don't make it to the uplink, or they get pulled out of the circle while they are fighting.
---
The only time you have to fight is in the last portion, so just stick and move until you get there. 
---
As a side, I switched from using my B2525 Fixer to using a B2515 Plasma Flamer, and it is perfect for daily ops. It has high ROF and high damage, so its DPS is off the charts, and you barely have to aim. Highly recommend any Blooded plasma flamer (plasma gun with flamer barrel) as a daily ops street sweeper.
---
My bloody non auto fixer can kill lvl 100 super mutants in 3 shots and my lever in 2 shots to the head ofc.
---
I also have a maxed out follow through. Doesn’t seem that bad.
---
Daily ops the durability for armor and weapons is 50% less depreciation, from what I know. Trash mobs I try to just use melee on, but I have a bunch of guns too like, hmmm what gun do I want to use today lol. Hey lunchboxes are back so those stack for xp.
---
Guess I thought I'd have new grind spots, but love the new super mutant at wes tek. Still haunting the same grounds in a way, but idk.
---
During all the months people have spoken about this, no one has ever shown one shred of proof.
---
Yea please
---
What is a slug buster?
---
Can't you go to your camp module and repair all broken items? Ive done that on several occasions, beats looking around for what's broken
---
Edit: nevermind i think I see what you're saying. Not items that are broken, but are lower than 100% and the health bar shows up. Gotcha
---
No mention of Mischief Night?
---
I'd like to recommend dropping Lone Wanderer for Herd Mentality +2 to all stats when in any team (even alone in a public team is nice) which gives further reason to use Strange In Numbers. My Junkie Heavy Gunner uses T-65 now to cope with the fact that I'm also an Empath which is a nice boon for my team, but that's often a thankless role as most players don't notice they now take 33% less damage unless I tell them.
---
I also pop psycho and berry mentats fairly regularly. For the boons provided.
---
My addictions are Daddy-O, Mentats, Alcohol, Psycho, and Day Tripper but I use Chem Fiend and Chem Resisiance to pop anything and everything as needed. r3 Party Girl with Whisky and a dose of Bufftats is my go to for Fast Travel when overencumbered.
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the input!
---
Would help if you shared what damage perks you are running and what your typical play style is. Hard to judge otherwise.
---
Haven't gotten anything yet. They haven't said anything about it either.
---
Had a few people in the daily ops team just dip if everyone didn’t come right away.
---
I’ve done a couple of each, and honestly haven’t noticed too much of a difference. They both last about as long as normal if not done even faster.
---
The Fractured Steel update has at least the 10 weeks of its season to launch updates, we will most likely get them within Season 3, just not in the year that ends with a 0.
---
January and part of February will still be part of the Season, and at least one more big patch is likely.
---
If you’re irritated by what other players do, you should just solo it like I do and keep your peace. 2 days in a row now that I’ve solo’ed it and made Elder.
---
How big was he?
---
I think you've got this slightly reversed. Legendary Charisma increases your special stat, and increases the number of perk slots you have for Charisma, but it does not increase the number of perks which can be shared. Charisma 6 + maxed Legendary Charisma means Charisma of 11, 11 perk slots to fill, but can still only share a two-star perk.
---
Do you know what daily ops are?
---
Why two buids thought? I figured they would just need to remove the enemies scaling and it would play mostly the same as pre OW.
---
I know  they plan to make future adjustments.  That's not even what I am talking about.  I just don't want them to make it pathetically easy like it was before- where I don't even  bother with 70 percent of the map.  I like it that Morgantown and Grafton no longer feel like a complete waste of time, where all I have to do is sneeze hard enough and enemies vaporize.
---
Make the game even harder, lol. Cmon ppl let's do this shit on the hardest difficulty! Idk before I got hooked on MMOs agn, I was playing one game at a time and being a completionist about it. For a lot of games to get the platinum trophy (ps4) you need to beat the game on the hardest difficulty, or do speed runs, and other shit. So yeah, taking two shots to kill a lvl 100 scorched leader is basically bumping this game from easy to medium lol
---
I keep it around for killing the ghouls at nuked White Springs.
---
That should be a bug then. The perk does not state that and should act like it states. Hopefully they fix that. Now if you are over 15 and trying to sharing another perk that is o you cuz it maxes out at 15. (Plus there is no level 6 perk to share anyway)
---
It seems most of the posts come from those who use hunting rifles or levers (bows too, i guess). I dont run characters with those 2 guns and have been fine on all 4 of the toons I play (bloodied commando, full hp non mutant commando, gunslinger/guerrilla, junkies heavy)
---
Got one of em too.  I do better with the lever action because it eats up less AP for the damage it does.  With grim reaper sprint on top I never run out of ap so I can take out a big group much quicker than with my Bloodied handmade by jumping from target to target with VATS.
---
With the handmade I run out of AP before Grim Reaper Sprint kicks in sometimes. 
---
For sustained single target damage, I'll take my handmade any day though.
---
Do you think they changed the spawn amounts in this recent patch? Because they didn’t... so they wouldn’t have to if it was split. The levels would just have to automatically scale to the player, just like they always do. Not very hard to implement
---
Did you read my original post? I think OW is in a perfect spot right now. So the PTS did it’s job in my opinion. 
---
People will always complain. That’s not an valid argument.
---
long as it's like not that Creation Club AMR then I'm all for that
---
Only if those characters are never allowed back into regular servers.  It would not be fair to other players to let some people “pay to win” on a private server and farm any new content that gets released in “easy mode” then bring their earnings over to sell to the plebs that had to struggle.  
---
it also creates a situation where when they are developing new content they need to do twice the work to build it for two groups of people, then you have to hope you can get enough testing in on the PTS.  I mean, look at where we are now. One wasteland isn’t something they sprung on us.  The damage changes isn’t “surprise”.  It’s been talked about and known. Where were the mountains of complaints like we had on the legendary perks?  It’s too late.  People had their time to speak.
---
This is relevant to my interests.
---
Make a low lvl character and pvp with it from lvls 15 to 40 or so. Then delete ther character and start over. 
---
Pvp is an entirely different ball game when you can't rely on good tier items and often face opponents with superior firepower and defense.
---
So no idea? Smh @ bethesda
---
Thank you! Yeah I reread the post and realized what they meant (:
---
I agree with you. It seems like those who are upset are screaming really loud. I just thought we should have a more level headed post. A difference of opinion is not only expected but, welcome.
---
Sell stuff you find to the NPC vendors up to 1400 caps a day.
---
 Weapons and armor, bulk scrap, meds ect. ect.
---
No Double XP til December?? There should be one every season!
---
Oh the way my character is has a bit of a complicated path but the basics of it is he was a government sleeper cell placed in vault 76. So he has quite a bit of patriotism too also nearly based solely on indoctrination.
---
you got a point!
---
Sell all your extra stuff to the railroad venders. You can get 1400 per day from them. Set up a water farm and sell tons of purified water
---
Daily Ops are more fun and don't require chasing down keycard drones or looking up nuke codes. If they had a boss like Earle or the queen, well, I would probably never launch a nuke again.
---
The damage nerf has also made Earle and the queen more of a chore for most nonoptimized builds. I'm getting about half damage on the queen pre-nerf, I haven't bothered with Earle post-nerf yet.
---
As a stealth sniper build I just sat that melee one out, I didn’t even try it
---
Try lowering the price of some of your items. I think ppl in this game expect their items to sell for a whole bunch but in reality they're not worth much at all. You could also research how to make easy caps. Personally I go to Morgantown HS and get all the plastic there and then bundle up all the junk I have and sell the bulk stuff in my camp for 15 caps. Easy money.

---
Very similar to mine and I find it very solid. One gun army is there soloy for the Queen and Earl and is not useful anywhere else
---
My vampire ffr gatling gun is my new favorite toy.
---
Hehe I spawned next to berkeley springs upon logging in and someone's workshop was overrun with lvl 75 anglers, so I killed em all and looted their absestos and adhesive :)
---
Do you run events like uranium fever?
---
Run that, pick up everything , waddle outside cook the glowing meat with super duper waddle to the station sell that and all the weapons.. kerching!
---
Well I think part of the issue is that you likely have better guns than most people, heh.
---
Look, Grahams not the smartest tool in the shed, at least he's close.
---

---
Crazy thing is, there has been a pc mod for this since about 4 hrs after it launched on pc that apperently worked great until this update because of Legendary perks(not sure though, I play on console).
---
That sounds like fun :D
---
Just here to say I love the new update ..
---
i'd like it to be sooner, but as long as it come someday... ...soon...
---
I was really hoping for a legendary perk card that increased aggro on the person slotting it.
---
In the next update! which isn't that far off!
---
Stop fast traveling. Sell stuff at good prices. Clear out uranium fever and sell EVERYTHING at the whitespring station.
---
I think that’s a good idea, another way to please both sides. Personally as a PS4 player who already has to shell out the extra sub fee just to play, the chances of me ever getting 1st are slim to none. Another option could be creating a game mode the player picks when selecting adventure mode so everyone can access both as they please without a paywall.
---
Flawed. Try including more buffs than just one receiver and 3 damage perks.
---
That's a fraction of the total buffs. Of course you shouldn't be one-shotting things.
---
I agree, it's nice to be able to actually use the whole map now to fight and not just like cranberry bog areas. Love the level 100 mutants along with the rest of them.
---
Just wait long enough and you will turn elderly naturally!
---
I have some swap cards like that to use when I'm on a team but I play solo 99% of the time. This is my "standard" perk load out.
---
I'm also here to say I love the new update
---
yeah i'm not a fan of mods
---
I’ve been so absorbed in the rifle debacle I didn’t notice. Durability needs a buff too !! Lol
---
So everybody is forced to one singular build. That doesn’t seem to be good game design. 
---
Also, the people who are struggling the most are the casual players. Which is a large group believe it or not. They can’t just switch up builds and add legendary perks
---
...You can blueprint brahmin?
---
This. When the game started, it was 1200, but spread out over all the vendors, so each only had 200. To get the 1400, you had to run into Grahm. 
---
Now they all have 1400. So every day, you would clean out the vendors.
---
 Yeah I love my Junkie FFR w/40% less damage taken while aiming Gauss shotty.
---
I dump all my plans and ammo at train stations. You're welcome, I'm hoping maybe you are one of the many who have found my stashes.
---
I try to keep about 20-30 extra points if I decide to respec, went a bit overboard and used up all my banked levels. Only had enough coins to max two legendary perks.
---
That's what I'm thinking about doing myself...some rainy day points...
---
Just pissed I didnt put two and two together to turn them in the other day hah
---
It’s not one line of code. It was a 20 GB update. Tons of infrastructure was changed to allow for dynamic scaling, plus all the weapon damage calculation changes, updates to the loot pool, etc
---
Ah, hmm. My instance must have been bugged out. I was getting pretty frustrated, lol. Thanks for the info, I will reboot the game and see if that helps.
---
Aw cmon chimmy choo choo meat weak is coming back at least lol
---
I actually do less damage on sneak attack than I do on regular vats headshots, so I think something is wrong.
---
Loved the event too but doubt it will be that one again after half the combined community had trouble with it crashing the game.
---
Personally on my ps4 I had no trouble with the event, a tiny bit laggy but that's normal when you continuously blow up the cars in whitesprings
---
I think players who are struggling should read up on builds, even a casual player can put a decent build together with the right know how and there are numerous players and youtubers who go out of their way to teach people. I get people's views about the new update good and bad, but it's time people, some players, actually focused on a build. Early on its harder which I get but at the same time there is so much information out there to help struggling players. Why should there be separate servers for the same game mode? It's on us to adapt, Bethesda have time and time again made things easy, they gave in to our demands, gave us things that we as a community wanted, they finally give us something we really needed and there is uproar and it needs to stop, casual players have for to long shaped how the majority play because they want the upper hand and its bullshit. They and anyone who is struggling needs to put in the work like endgamers have. Stop asking for shit and get on with it and play.
---
Enemies drop in less than a second with my v25 gat plasma
---
Ya first time doing this we just shot enemies until someone figured out they were like Zombies on COD and just kept coming. 
---
Thanks for the PSA : i didn't know the speed was determined by distance.
---
Starting out, I'd buy the legendary guns people were selling in their vendors and add a few hundred caps. Every now and then, you'll find a beauty that you can sell for even more.
---
My crew has been dropping queens like crazy with the update she goes down in like 2 minutes
---
you should probably go to the Fallout 76 website. you will find the info you are looking for.
---
NYC those sandwiches are called heros.
---
I mean tbf people on the PTS told bethesda that newer/mid level players would struggle big time with this update and they didn't do anything. And I would be fine being locked to a private server. I just want to go back.
---
Daily ops are my new favorite thing to do in the game. I love starting a group, getting 3 other lower level players in and just knocking out Elder tier
---
Does such a thing exist?
---
I said new player, not  new character.
---
So I noticed it after daily op, reset app and now I'm doing regular sneak damage
---
I agree with you.  A buddy and I play this game together but we don't have the time for this new grind.  We started looking at new games to move too.
---
How I feel about power armor
---
Lol there it is rofl. Problem solved.
---
It's more then just challenging. I can not see how its possible, out of ammo, low on stims and caps, armour broken can not repair. The fights are taking way more resources then they give and that's not sustainable, with my build at least.
---
Most likely:    
---
You fast travel too much.    
---
Too much spending with less income. What are your vendor prices?    
---
I have yet to pay over 450 for anyone single mutation serum. My main has over 13k and it's mostly for gear and mats when I don't have the time to grind(not that I'd want to).    
---
Purified water at roughly 250 or so can max out a vendor's caps. Sell things for reasonable prices ad most people don't have max caps or anywhere near it.    
---
IMO, if you don't have an immediate use for it or mats for repair sell it.
---
20-30 is what I'm thinking as well.
---
I had no idea it worked that way.  I guess that’s why people were motioning me over, lol.
---
is your target in combat with anything else? player or mob? sneak multipliers don't trigger if that's the case.
---
but they made sneak *multipliers* additive as well, for some absurd reason. so the bonus is nowhere near as expressive as before.
---
I heard plenty of people talk about that too,  but like you, I never really had too many problems, I might have crashed out 3 or 4 times. XB1 here.
---
My damage seemed to lose more than 40%. I had 4 pieces of unweilding and 1 life saving.  A handful of mutations and switched between Bloodied Grognaks Axe, or a nice cursed pickaxe. They were both doing around 1300 damage and now they barely eclipse 400. 
---
That on top of the fact that 2 of 3 times I’ve tried the daily op it wasn’t working.(securing site was stuck at x2 and the progress wasn’t going up.)
---
I’m probably going to put the game away for a while.
---
My newest character sells all baseball related gear. And that is it. Baseball mits, hats, grenades, bats, mods. He also has a baseball museum for a camp
---
I got the achievement from some asshole nuking me while I was setting prices on my vendor. Had to repair my whole damn CAMP.
---
It's not that hard once you get the hang of it.  I know killing shit is probably a lot harder now, but the old easy way to do it for me was just clear out harpers ferry, or the uranium fever mine, and grab literally anything you come across, equip hard bargain and sell it to the vendor.  Took like 30 min, and got you max caps or pretty close.
---
Also across the bridge and through the tunnel in NJ those sandwiches are called subs.
---
Well there have been some changes, some Atomicshop items consume less budget than their normal counterparts even though they're nearly the same xD
---
Haha I didn’t know wolves were so durable
---
Do events. Public or standard (without the !). You'll be swimming in the damn things.
---
Definitely how it should've went. 1 point per level no matter what would've been the right idea. The 50 they gave us was just about as lazy as it can get when it comes to compensating people that last out on perk coins due to a bug and respeccing.
---
My brother has a non monetized free mobile game with no microtransactions, but I forget the name
---
Have someone hit earl dead on and be on top of the shack when it drops , basically a guaranteed completion
---
I’ll do it for you if you are on PS4 , my name is my gamer tag
---
Watch your language, Initiate.
---
Kind of yeah.  I thought they were going to be account wide too, but it seems they didn't want to give us the easy route and have a bunch of alts and have the perks maxed day one. It adds a reason to play I bet in their eyes.
---
Right?! I felt like I was stuck with west tek and huntersville and the like just to level up. Roaming around makes you feel like you have to always be aware and ready to battle.
---
I still question how foodbuilds or other specific builds would struggle since there are not that many perks that improve the process of cooking. 
---
There is still tons of perks you can put on to be good at killing stuff even with all the perks that can help improve your cooking and food carrying ability.
---
I did Daily Ops with my random Daily Ops group yesterday. It was the first time I’ve done anything with a group.
---
I like to change my attire every couple of weeks so I can dawn my rare outfits periodically instead of them sitting in my stash year round. For holidays I dress up accordingly. For my personal bday I dress up nice. Come winter I’ll layer up some winter jacket and jeans and a beanie of some kind. It’s not important for in game stuff for me, just fun to go thru all my stuff and dress up.
---
You get guaranteed 2 legendaries from that event (if you are able loot Earle) and a chance for a 3rd which is the cursed weapon or as I call it 40 scrip surprise! The silos were doing something funky for a few days where depending on what the control room at The whitesprings looked like in a server, different nuke codes were required, this caused a lot of confusion for a while and people stopped launching nukes for fear of wasting nuke cards on the wrong code. But all of that is fixed now so. That’s why.
---
Sure thing, I'll message him and ask
---
If all perk cards were shared to begin with, then I could totally see this.  Not sure why they went the RNG route to begin with.  I have a main and two alts and it’s a grind.  
---
On the flip side, having infiltrator in a level 1 character is really useful.  Alt/mules are also useful for the level up challenges as well.  For legendary special perks; you won’t have enough perks cards to even equip as a low level, though.  Some are level locked.
---
You can get 6 actually, but it stacks with DXP, so I intend to save them all for that.
---
Your obsession with me is creepy.
---
Yeah, there's no way they could manage this.
---
How do u know what team is a daily ops team? Do u just gotta keep joining them?
---
Ahh ok, yeah idk man I mean if you respawn it always brings you back to about a quarter health and if you really need to heal rads grab some nuka grapes from the whitesprings nuka be for OR the wayward to get brahmin milk to heal rads (without losing any mutations)
---
42. No specific build but was focusing heavily on melee with shotguns as secondaries.
---
I mean I get why, especially for those who are not into combat and enjoyed the chill nature the game previously had, or newer people or people with meh builds, this seems like a patch tailor made to ruin those people's day.
---
I'm not really a fan of a the way they did this either, my character was just kinda neutered and a lot of my perks now feel very low impact, and there's not much I can do about it, but I don't think it's really impacted my game-play terribly.  I am mainly just more useless at bosses, but luckily I was pretty useless before, so no worries, lol.    
---
I do feel for people who are not having fun though, and I think it's a terrible idea to make the game suck for low level players and casuals.  They make up the bulk of a games players.
---
The only people that seem to have been hit the hardest are the low levels and the only reason for that is because now they can no longer get power leveled, they actually have to fight now, use high levels can't do much to help them as the same enemy for us is a higher level, therefore, harder to kill.
---
Oh, that’s good to know! Thank you.
---
Better would be each enemy exploding in confetti when killed like with a lunchbox.
---
I'm not op, but it is happening to me on PS4 and I did not purchase levels.
---
Me and my friends just do it all at once, claim it while they are out of the circle run out they run in claim it rinse repeat, five claims in like 8 minutes
---
Not really, no. It makes the character level actually mean something, while giving you a small benefit from having a different character with a much higher level, what with being able to equip the first level of them. Cards like "What Rads" are a game-changer for a low-level alt, even at the first level.
---
It's excellent for some, not so much for others.  I don't mind it that much, I agree, game was way too easy before, still is actually.  Lower levels are having a hard time though.
---
Sell legendaries at 50 100 and 150. You have no idea the caps youll have lol
---
How do you get 6 per day?
---
Do events to rack up a shitload of stimpaks. then go sell those. selling 10 step packs can give you a couple hundred caps with the right charisma perks. this adds up rather quickly has you do more and more public events.
---
Also, be smart with the fast travel. There's several places you can travel to for free (CAMP + survival tent, crater, foundation, Vault 76). Travel to the closest free area before making the jump to the desired location.
---
They better change things sooner then later because I know a decent amount of people that are looking for a new game.
---
Dont forget they banned dupers then unbanned them and didnt take away their duped weapons!
---
The only problem with that is trying to please both the hardcore and casual players. The playerbase is split practically in half between the two, so while you and I don't mind a harder challenge, a lot of people just want to level and build camps without having to worry about min-maxing their builds. I think the best solutions are either to add a "harder" game mode server, or add more endgame content (like the Daily Ops but even harder) to the game for us.
---
you could easily just place the backpack onto the back of the torso
---
Its 2 coins per level, so a 1 star card gives 2 and if you level it to 3, you used 3 1 star cards to get 6.
---
Same amount of perk coins
---
Maybe at first but I’ve heard that some people leave their pip boy on the status page and use the button macro (x/a I think?) which should only take a couple of seconds, especially if you don’t use the true pipboy menu
---
Damn that's harsh! Until this morning I've only ever seen them go off in the bottom right or the mine NE of the dam. So we can launch them wherever we like? That sounds like a recipe for disaster right there
---
You can purchase it with gold bullion. Not sure which vendor but Samuel at foundation seems right. If not there, just check crater and Regs at vault 79 too, one of them has it
---
the idea in itself is not terrible. I played ESO before One Tamriel. I play casually so didnt try it when One Tamriel launched so no idea if it was bad initially, but I have no problems when I do play. I havent played fallout in about 2 weeks, but one thought I had was that ESO doesnt have weapons with ammo (aside from the bow as far as i know) so there isn't that need for resources for ammo. I also didnt feel like enemies were vastly more spongey, just slightly. Again, this is going entirely on feel from a filthy casual.
---
It is, lore wise, fallout is so much fun to write for. Though sometimes I get a little too creative. Some notable examples of throw away ideas I have on hand is: Moth man being an actual god, radiation stand abilities, the existence of cryptids not caused by radiation, etc. Pretty much if the game can't prove it wrong I have likely thought of it.
---
thx cpt obvious.
---
the glitch was fixed days ago, still nobody seems to be launching nukes and the reason is that the reward is no longer worth the effort
---
Sorry! As usual, intent is hard to read on the internet. 
---
I’ll take some time and see if I can focus my perks a bit more. I suppose it’s just never been a priority.
---
I fail to really see the difference mattering much. But I’m open to more input.
---
Casuals are not whales and whales are what makes them money. I have seen 8 people that have already spent cash to clear the board. They are who the creators cater to followed by FO1st/cash spenders and then the mid money spenders. Never cater to casuals they don't make the money they just serve to make the game look more full and add some popularity that is why bones are tossed to them.
---
I did a bunch and wondering the same.
---
meanwhile, we have 3 bonus SCORE events, and no one seems to care.
---
You can buy 3 from Foundation and 3 from Crater. And it's not even daily, you just need to change servers and buy 3 more from each of them til you run out of bullion.
---
&gt;i wouldn't be surprised if durability was also nerfed in an effort to sell repair kits too though.
---
This was my first initial thought when I noticed that my shit was getting wrecked. 
---
I'm convinced with no evidence.
---
Umm ok?  Coming from the guy who is first to post on anything I write lately... lol...
---
This is the issue.   Bethesda felt that everyone was pigeon holed into a bloodied or junkie build.  That everyone had legacy or “magic” weapons and the end game was too easy.  So they nerfed the meta.  The problem?   Now, people are forced AGAIN to change the meta.  Stealth rifleman?  Not so good.  Commando?  Good.  Now everyone wants to be a bloodied commando.  Working as intended?
---
Hey, we get rank 1 of at least 3 different Damage perks. I always disliked that ranks 2 and 3 were less efficient than the first taste so I always skipped them. Lol.
---
Yep nearly 150 turned in over 2 days. Took so long.
---
As a stealth commando day one was pretty gnarly. I died a lot and felt rather useless. Next time there is a melee event I’ll probably try to run full health power armor with dodgy, serendipity, etc and just try to tank the thing. Have a few pretty legit vampires heavy weapons I guess I could take out for a swing especially now that perk cards aren’t doing as much as they used to 
---
Yesterday’s event was a blast though!  Played that one probably 10 times just because of how much fun it was
---
I'm sure a lot of people are casual because they don't have the time to put in the work. That's who's being hit the hardest with this update. I agree with what you said I just think there are better ways.
---
NO!!!! fuck right off with that nonsense.
---
Do you use sneak perks? You end up using less ammo. Also use super duper and ammosmith to cure your ammo issue. Run silos to get lead for ammo as well.
---
I turned in all the cards I never use, save a couple I expect they'll rework once they get rid of thirst/hunger, just in case they end up being awesome. Keeping about a dozen perk coins on-hand to swap out legendary cards as needed.
---
Well faster fire rate on a semi automatic had always been useless. There isn't a fire rate to improve when it already fires as fast as you can pull the trigger.
---
Until you run out of bullion.  That's what I mean.  You only get enough for two per day, plus 3 per week from smiley.
---
Yes that is the one I'm referring to. Thank you for your response. I guess i missed it last time. Hopefully it comes back!
---
Same here
---
Ah I see,
---
Only when hell freezes over will we see such things.lol
---
You can get triple xp with normal buffs/armor and lunchboxes. Double xp saves time but it's not like it's that important, especially with extra score weekends and stuff.
---
I have 186 and probably won't go lower than 150.
---
3 minutes tops added to my normal time in 5 runs since the patch.
---
No glitches, no magic weapons, only hacker/lockpick shortcuts, no premade cores.
---
On a vats semi auto, non optimized build, Running 1* dmg cards.
---
The longest time was mostly because I had 6 legos, 3 of which were assaultrons and one downed me.
---
They really arent that hard.
---
What I meant by singular is you had to go to PURE rifleman. We’re you able to keep some points for other weapons like melee or shotgunner? Probably not. 
---
You and I have had 2 years experience to prepare for this update. We are the minority. The increase in difficulty is pushing away the newer players and casuals. A lot of what we gained from Wastelanders might be lost because of OW
---
As someone who has never had more than a couple thousand caps because I spend them constantly, and who's character seems completely useless after this update in some areas, that's way too fucking many caps.
---
I can understand them tailoring the game a little to people who play a lot, but holy fuck does that alienate every single new player and people who are not good at farming caps.
---
On Double XP, with a shit-ton of Lunchboxes, Leader's, Live &amp; Love 8, Cranberry Relish, Brain Bombs, full Unyielding and Well Rested I was getting the repeatable 100 SCORE like every 1-2 minutes... I'll take that over Double SCORE any day.
---
Gotcha, guess that isn't the issue I've been having then. Thanks there's alot of bad info around
---
Also, if you are playing in teams, swap the "lone wanderer" with "inspirational" and "strange in numbers".
---
Exactly the same here, melee sneaks aren't as much fun now!
---
I turned in all 200ish plus I had lying around not being used including unpicked levels, but I kinda wish I had kept some because I feel like most of my perks are kinda useless now, and I'll probably want to respec.
---
It's a bug.
---
You don't have to be hardcore to assign perk cards. Rifle cards are for rifles, pistol cards are for pistols etc so on and so forth. I get where you stand but if that's the case why play an RPG? If you just ran around willy nilly in Diablo, Fallout 3 or about every RPG for that matter, exploring and ignoring stats you'd have the same results. This isn't a walking/exploring simulator. It's a post apocalyptic wasteland online RPG that supposed to make you fear what's around the corner.
---
If you don't want to make the effort to build your character, copy what most players generously posted in both document and/or video form. If you're not interested in a challenge I guess wait till enough complain and they implement an easy mode. I for one am enjoying this new update as many others are.
---
I'm on Xbox and haven't got a clue who earl is... Looks like I've got to get googling yet again lol. Steep learning curve in the wasteland and we seem to be left to figure everything out ourselves after the responder airport quests.
---
Bad move bro! I fully maxed heavy guns and rifleman using legendary strength.
---
Not a bad roll either. Vampire's on a full-auto weapon is fantastic if you want to play more of a tank role during public events.
---
You on PC or console?
---
I’m absolutely dumbfounded they didn’t have one between season 1 and season 2. What an idiotic group of people.
---
Agreed, heck an option to respec at request outside of level ups is needed. Every lvl increase requirement to level up and higher you are the harder it gets to respec let alone max legendary cards.
---
Just a bug same as before when the gatling gun would be able to fire as fats as you could pull the trigger on third person
---
My crew has started calling it “ making someone my bitch “ we roll up on a camp and dump everything we have like oh shit got um lol , people get legendaries plans food aid items you name it and we act like they got punked , or we say “ Poppa woody sends his regards “ and run back into the bushes. Bushwookies have a good time in the wasteland
---
If you have a decent weapon, it's alright, if you don't... well you better find one, and that's easier said than done.
---
Do what most people do. Complete dailies than log off.
---
I’m still launching, on Queen however, I know folks need repair kits more then a cursed shovels, I’m on Xbox one,
---
Its got 15% faster reload as well
---
This!!
---
Oh he will get his chance. A lot of it is we know he would be uncomfortable with some of the sexual innuendos and also the worlds presented are frankly much more brutal 200 years later than quaint friendly WV. 
---
He isn’t allowed to be on public chat (only private Xbox chat) and his parental settings are such that even if a stranger did join his party, they wouldn’t be able to hear each other. 
---
We’ve been easing him into more adult themed gaming starting with skyrim when he was 9.  FO76 when he was 10. When he is 12, he can give fallout 4 a shot. He’ll probably be ready for 3 and new vegas by the time he’s 13.
---
I ran into so many 3 star legendaries just wandering around yesterday.  I think 5-7 just in an hour or two around cranberry bog.
---
True true. I had max bullion though so I already have 50+ stockpiled.
---
It’s a good idea until you realize the vault full of Gary’s is on the opposite side of the country and won’t be opened for another 75+ years... Bethesda really likes trying to keep everything in game (not including atomic shop) canon.
---
Build? By level 47 you should have plenty of perks selected that conform to your playstyle.
---
It's part of some furniture bundle IIRC.
---
Edit: I think it was called the West Virginia bundle.
---
You say:  You need to change your build, read up on guides, adapt.  This is forcing the specific meta builds on us.  Diversity in builds is even more limited now.  If. commando was nerfed; we’d have even less diversity in the meta.  It’s all based on the right gear, right perks, and right legendaries.
---
Did you try optimizing your build? You can't run 1 perk card and still win anymore
---
The same
---
Yep and rifleman is one of the weakest builds. They were never great but now they’re worse.
---
My dad got one the other day i believe
---
Yep, or a hacked weapon if you're on PC. They've been getting more popular.
---
Have you tried going into build mode and looking?
---
I don't even know if I'll be able to do the dailies! I couldn't even complete back to the beat because I was getting overrun by ghouls and ran out of ammo.
---
On Double XP, with a shit-ton of Lunchboxes, Leader's, Live &amp; Love 8, Cranberry Relish, Brain Bombs, full Unyielding and Well Rested I was getting the repeatable 100 SCORE like every 1-2 minutes. I had the Legendary Run done within a month of when it started thanks mostly to DXP. I'll take that over Double SCORE any day.
---
I've never wanted a build that uses multiple kinds of weapons. I have always been a riflemen since day one.
---
 It just so happened my pipe rifle used gunslinger perks as well. Now I don't have to use 9 agility points for those perks anymore. 
---
If I wanted to use shotguns I would make a shotgun build on a different character. If I wanted to use heavy weapons I would do the same.
---
That's the way it was, enemies in each area had a level range based on what player spawned them when they walked by.
---
Bloodied lever: Tested my bloodied lever that I had in stash just now. 750 damage headshots on whitespring ghouls. Everything including 3 star legendaries is 1 hit. Went to westtek. 3* legendaries and lv 100 muties go down in 2 hits. Hitting for 650 to 850 per hit. Lever is fine. Anyone who can't live with those numbers needs to get better.
---
TSE hunting rifle: doing 250x2 on headshots, with small splash of about 50. Takes down 80% of a lv 100 mutie with single sneak headshots. All muties i tested on in Westtek took 2 chest shots, max.
---
Quad guass: I might actually make a toon who mains this gun. 394 base damage on gun with adrenal reaction (no nerd rage, about 25% hp). About 300 to 500 damage uncharged headshots. 1k to 1.3k displayed number charged headshot. From testing, I can kill a lv 100 legendary mutie with one charged headshot. They should have more than 1.3k hp. I think it's doing more in charged shots than numbers display. Vats sucks on this gun.
---
After those tests, I can tell the rifle builds out there: I'm making a rifle toon. Rifles seem fine. Get gud.
---
It was reported many times in the PTS, but I'm not sure if it was ever acknowleged by Beth.
---
If you are having trouble getting people to visit your shops, move your camp near a high traffic area like top of the world or whitespring or crater and foundation since they are free to fast travel to now.
---
Yeah, I looked where I placed it and it wasn't there. My camp is on the road near Watoga, there a cave under the road near there.
---
Bro, I have no idea who you are.
---
No idea, nothing's been said about it besides it's existence
---
happening to me too, didn't purchase ranks. when i log in sometimes it tells me I'm at rank 1 out of 1, then i get score and it tells me of all the ranks I've already gotten.
---
You spec points absolutely make your build. 
---
I would have to move 20 points to switch from a rifleman to a melee build. That's 20 levels before I can fully switch and in the meantime, I'm gimping myself the entire time until it's done.
---
Spec points are not easy to move around.
---
Yeah you could keep getting on it and the +2 strength would stack. I had it up to like +30 extra strength while testing. I assume you can just keep stacking it, but yeah obv big exploit.
---
I'd be happy to tag along. You on Discord? I'm easier to reach there.
---
Did they nerf explosive baits too?
---
u/valseek u/ladydevann are we getting mischief night this year?
---
Well, you certain answered the question  you do not logic.
---
I run a junkies build with pa and I rarely get hurt in these I honestly did not realize people where struggling with these I guess I've just been fortunate with my teams
---
Yes, I agree it's better now and it makes the whole map relevant again. With the system they have now implemented, I would think it's possible to make it even more interesting with something like a zone event, where for example Ash Heap enemies are twice the level they would usually be.
---
I agree you shouldn’t need a “build” to survive. I still don’t think you need a meta build to survive. You may need one to stroll through every area without challenge, but that was always the case. I try not to overthink my cards and just have fun. 
---
That being said... I haven’t played my rifleman character yet and anticipate being very disappointed. Especially since he doesn’t use legendary gear and is level 120 lol
---
I am with you on Fallout 1st.  I most likely will be cancelling tonight.
---
XP needed to level up stops increasing at lv1000.
---
And the better solution would be to give us a proper character reset function, that would reset all perks, levups etc. Giving us back all the perk card packs and levels ups. We talked about these issues and tried to suggest this reset thing to bethesda on PTS forums but they don't listen.
---
Instead they said they will give us the 50 coins and i quote "as compensation". Which is nothing compared to what people have lost, not to mention that everyone got the 50 coins. Be that fresh character or not, making it meaningless gesture.
---
Yeah I'm not getting as much satisfaction out of the gunplay.  Stealth seems 'ok' in non-Ops though I almost never get the sneak attack notification I do see damage difference.
---
I miss using the Lever Rifle, it was satisfying.
---
It's weird how they keep trying to make this a looter shooter, so now they've changed the shooting to more mirror it.  Yet there are still too many roadblocks on the loot side of thing to really make it like a Borderlands system.
---
I've been pushing that for months.    
---
IMO, something similar to what WoW had back in 2009. I don't play it anymore and if it's still up I guess it's still there.    
---
You could have a central hub like outside of Morgantown. I think there  needs to be a section/tab for new/alt players so greedy idiots don't snag everything up for cheap. These characters can get things they need/want for low prices.    
---
Each char has their own linked list and all items are sorted by:    
---
Clothing, armor, weapons by type, ammo, aid, etc.    
---
The AH would of course take a small cut when something is sold. If something is in the auction house for too long then you get a notification to Renew or Cancel. Renew adds another 30 days while Cancel delivers it to my next suggestion: An in-game post office/package delivery system.    
---
This would be available at every train station. We would automatically get a Mailbox item that can be created at your CAMP. Text messages can be sent for 1 cap each to any player as long as you know the username. Anything with items or caps costs a small fee to send. Each package has a slot limit of 10 and depending on weight the fee is appropriate. Accepting messages and deliveries is free of course.    
---
To send to an alt, you should be able to send to yourself leaving those items in kind of a mail/limbo. You could mail an item, switch to whatever character and then get it. This way you save a LOT of time.    
---
BGS would fix a lot of their rep in reducing grind in this.
---
How bout you op-in on deez nutz
---
I dont mind this update, im only level 74 and a friend of mine is returning to this game and hes level 20 so when im in the forest helping him gain xp its boring as i was one shotting everything but now its more balanced i guess, i only hate it because i use so much ammo, thank god they added ammo factory.
---
I'm lvl 220 I have had lvl ups sitting since I hit like lvl 150. I currently have like 70 sitting cuz I don't need the cards I have and I don't want to move points. Now the only incentive I see to use them is to intentionally get cards I won't use to scrap them to upgrade my legendary perks
---
I could have sworn that after 100 it takes the same amount of xp per level up to 1000
---
It makes the wasteland actually feel more like a wasteland. People complain they have to use more supplies and ammo and what not. Well yeah, that's what they are for. Its not hard to get more, people just found something new they could complain about in the endless cycle of complaints lol
---
Let's keep it that way, please. lol  I have enough idiots surrounding me.
---
Next patch
---
Only get it for 30 mins, so you’d have to get on and off 100 times every 30 mins, then do whatever in the time it takes you to do that 100 times minus 30 mins and then do it again. It’s not practical but for small buffs was yeah obv issue.
---
Good idea, but I'm going to use legendary strength to add strong back instead. Lol.
---
Are you on PS4? Do you get the popup for the bonus ranged damage?
---
Ah, didn't realise it was completely new this year. Thanks.
---
No, that person was just a shit talker. Boss just has some ammo, grenades, and some chems drop. Nothing special.
---
All the good shit is given at the end of the DO.
---
Yeah, but all the other events are on the roadmap. The only reason I can think of is that they’re gonna be doing something with the whitespring resort and have to move or completely get rid of the Halloween event.
---
I guess i see your point.
---
It really doesn't.  You just have to get to a little higher of a level compared to someone else.
---
I think covert op is bugged in the sense that it works for melee as well.
---
I'm pretty sure the damage is being applied even though the message is not showing. I don't think it ever shows if you're using vats, too.
---
but keep in mind they made sneak *multipliers* additive as well. so now I'm getting a whopping 37 extra damage on a legacy flamer.
---
My bad!the adrenal reaction serum.!lol i would gladly pay for that!
---
Edit
---
Unpopular opinion, as an anecdote:
---
The first time I played Fallout 4, I went for the QoL/base building perks and stats. Charisma, gunsmith, armorsmith, local leader etc. By the time I hit level 10, I was constantly getting owned every time I went out to explore.
---
Why?
---
Because games don't reward you with god-like powers for being a construction worker, and they *shouldn't*.
---
Back to 76, you can still do decent damage if your perks are set up right, and you have the right equipment.
---
The ammo problem... ammo is so easy to mass produce, I literally have 10s of thousands of every ammo I use, and loads of lead, steel, and gunpowder.
---
It's not the game, and it's not the changes. It's the way some of you are playing it.
---
I've never had this problem, but my next suggestion is server hopping. The CAMP unit itself should never disappear, so the problem could resolve itself.
---
What would be wrong with that?
---
They ignored my suggestion but the forum mods loved it
---
thanks! where did you get this information? did i miss something?
---
I'm really curious how the changes will affect my build, a very casual-like stealth sniper with 3x Chameleon pieces as well as a Prime Troubleshooter's hunting rifle, Executioner's lever action and Vampire's handmade. Either way I'm not going to complain or change my build (too much), I spent 700 hours with this one so it's going to stay even if Scorched take two bullets to the head now.
---
Yes, and Yes.
---
Yeah I guess now that the queen can actually be crippled again you're right!
---
It’s not a grind. People are just lazy because they’re used to just running around 1 shotting everything. Gotta have cover or range now.
---
Sounds like you had ammo factories to me.
---
I thoight fasnacht event was dead this year as it was march in 2019. I dont think it is getting cancelled, probably just more "surprise!" stuff
---
I had wondered if the ai did that but it’s inconsistent we’ve tried and sometimes it will ignore the person attacking it and charge at the person who hasn’t shot it once, maybe that’s just a common glitch though
---
Since the vendors inventory are all (AFAIK) server based, if you server hop I bet you can buy as much as you like. Legendary Modules also work the same way, server hop and get another 10.
---
I think it's important to know the 'why' part before giving a suggestion, hence the backstory. Problem being the ammo scarcity in the lower end and ammo inflation in the upper end of the player base in reference to the time spent playing the game. Sorry that you don't see it that way.
---
I get max caps every day from the NPC vendors. I sell almost entirely stuff from the "aid" category. I make and sell drugs (radaway and healing salves are super easy, mentats and flavored mentats are great too), and I cook and sell all of the meat that I get from normal gameplay. Mutation serums sell for 500 caps each, but the recipes are expensive to buy.
---
You will definitely want the super duper perk and the chemist perk to maximize your crafting.
---
No re spec.
---
As a pvp player I love to hear all the carebear food builds complain “well that’s now how I play the game”. Well I don’t want to play pve. Stop reporting me for griefing you when you enter a designated pvp zone.
---
Nope. Actually makes sense.
---
So you've managed to reach level 50 with 0 perks and not managed to get a legendary weapon.
---
Great analysis.
---
Is perk loadouts means the same as restating your whole character? Sorry for my bad english, I don't know the actual world. 
---
For example, if I want to try a new build, I wouldn't have to move point by point, is that what it means?
---
I'll gave it a try soon
---
This perk is terribly undertuned. You'd have to literally feed to get any value. Then you get slapped with 60 second respawn timer.
---
It's counterintuitive.
---
Yes, but the amount of xp/level keeps scaling up.
---
yeah, you're about as useful as spamming the bash button.
---
it's a stupid trait that only serves to inconvenience the player.
---
Level scaling is largely made bad when grinding is a key aspect of the game. When you combine the two everything becomes a giant time sink. When World of Warcraft started doing that a lot of people I knew just started playing other games. At least with Fallout 76 the combat system has some diversity. Killing hundreds of mobs with the same attacks and combos is tedious at best.
---
I have a TSE pipe pistol and it's only six shots.   Of course, I haven't tried it with tank killer yet.
---
This sounds like it might actually make the game semi-challenging and is tempting me to come back to it lol.
---
It all unlocks if you get elder
---
Are perk cards account wide or limited to one character? I want to be able to have different builds without having to respec.
---
I think it drops a fair amount of ammo? Other than that I can't say I saw anything amazing when i've been looting them.
---
I say ignore them and go for the kill, time is of the essence in daily ops afterall
---
the answer is C) you should check this subreddit more often.
---
Its currently disabled due to its buff being stacked
---
Holy shit, downvoted to hell for speaking some sense.   
---
They all just want to be able to run through and look at all the shiny pretty things without any effort. Come on... just give them the participation trophy and have done with it.

[Weight Bench Temporarily Disabled – Sept 16, 2020 | Beth.net](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/428366/weight-bench-temporarily-disabled-sept-16-2020?language%5B%5D=it)
---
Did you check to see if it stored the camp plans? Hope you find it, nothing worse then losing all your work before your ready
---
Seems pretty useful since you can't kill them without it.
---
It would 100% be used to grief people.
---
This game hasn't needed it, and adding it would only make things worse.
---
My guy if you are on Xbox I will give you 1000 caps  I can’t get anymore since the max caps is so relatively low
---
Damage is fine. Range needs a buff. A big buff.
---
Its not as bad as killing a legendary, but the boss does drop a lot of ammo. 
---
Doesn't really justify calling names tho.
---
Yes, yes yes.  A thousand times yes.
---
And I’m not JUST talking about daily ops. Any new quests, new events, expeditions when they come out... all of those are things that will need to be balanced TWICE.  They can’t add the new quests to the game and let the autoscaling they just spent months working on do its thing, now they’ll have to do the extra work to go back and do it the old way.  Like I said, it is not as easy as it sounds to just “remove the scaling” when you’re creating new content that didn’t have the scaling to begin with.  
---
Either the PTS did a good job for OW or not.  People had said they were worried about low/mid level characters, they didn’t change things.  Maybe they’ll make a few tweaks, maybe not. Clearly this was done because it opens up new things in the future (such as legendary perks, things like take one for the team would not have worked well with multiplicative damage). This is the way forward. It’s been two days and people seem to be barely making any attempt to even to adapt to a change.  
---
And you’re right, clearly they aren’t the casuals.  Maybe some back end data supports not worrying about the casuals in the grand scheme of things.  
---
I’m just saying, asking them to maintain two servers, do twice the work, open weird situations where people are bouncing back and forth is the WORST possible solution to a problem, if it really is a problem
---
I was disappointed to see it taken off the road map. Been waiting FOREVER. The legendary perks have helped a bit, but I still want those loadouts!
---
Pixel Dungeon and it's variants.
---
Two words 
---
water collectors
---
got it. thanks!
---
but fuck those resilient robots.
---
They do.
---
My gf and I recently visited a base that matches this description.  If it's the one I'm thinking of, it inspired the both of us and I intend to build there!
---
Yeah, I like the camp that I have and really don't want to rebuild it. Although if I have to, it would help with my Weekly Challange this week lol
---
what kind of build do you want? high health or low? gun type? vats or no vats? power armor or not? explosive weapon? mutations? do you have legendary special cards for say agility or endurance and if so what level? do you have legendary cards you can still buy/use? how many legendary slots do you have?...let me know these things and i'll make a build for you.
---
thank you for your help!
---
No ranks purchased.
---
[Intended](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/itcdkn/bethesda_is_electric_absorption_legendary_perk/g5dht2s/)
---
Honestly, I am in agreement with you. I have a lower level (15) Gunslinger as well, and encounters feel much more tactical which i like. Reminds me more of FO4's survival. I'm enjoying the post-patch world on my 138 unarmed and 71 stealth sniper as well.
---
But I understand not everyone likes that though - the increased challenge and more careful play - and sadly this isn't a single player game with a difficulty slider so everyone can be happy.
---
I thought I was crazy having 15 levels banked kept getting worried there was a point where it would stop saving them and I’d lose them, glad to know other people store their levels too
---
The game was always harder at the beginning.  Eventually new players will level up and be fine
---
The legendary cards make me not want to play alts. Gonna take me about 10 more years to max out all 6 cards, so can't waste time not playing on my main.
---
How’d you figure that one out? When I’m playing other games, like Grand Theft Auto online, I get harassed by nine year olds constantly. My workaround is an invite only party, but it’s not particularly convenient for the one guy who jumps in and out of a dozen parties. It’s more of an annoyance, really.
---
Ah yes forgot about that place as well.
---
I would like to refer you to this post

---
The problem is not really  for the very early game, but rather for players around level 20-60 (mid game, or pre SBQ players)
---
That will be for the advanced respec kitsch. They will give out some free basic ones as rewards.
---
No. 😆    
---
Choices are permanent and if you can't handle that then not you should learn. The cost of unequipping one each time is 1 Perk Coin. Nukes and Dragons has the Legendary Perks built into it. Use it. Learn.
---
I play on xbox
---
Oh I haven't messed up yet. Haven't moved a single point.
---
I'm just trying to look out for others.
---
I second this☝ I'm probably gonna play for the first time today after work
---
Biv is my favorite NPC in the game.
---
I would LOVE to have him at my camp.
---
Hey quick question about bloodied stealth rifle - a friend of mine is still getting used to post patch stuff and I'm wondering if you have any info on how you're getting on with it?
---
I can’t even claim it from the scoreboard to unlock it
---
Do you even lift bro?  currently they are disabled.
---
There’s a difference between using a specific build like “Junkies” or “bloodied” and actually just picking perks that make sense.  That’s where I’m having problems with people’s issues.  Did you go out of your way to actively choose the worst perks in the game?  I mean even if you wanted to focus on being a trader and taking all the weight reduction perks, there were still dead levels you had to pick other things.  We’re people grinding out to level 40+ with Radstags in the forest?  We’re they just joining events, tagging the legendaries,and leeching XP from everyone else? 
---
I don’t have any meta builds.  Period.  I’m doing fine.  I know there are people doing much better than me.
---
There is still reports of auto complete. They said they are “still looking into it”.
---
I would just give yourself a 15-20 min break at 12 when they reotate
---
Whatever. In my opinion you’re just looking at the worst. Good luck having such a pessimistic view of life. I’m done trying to get you to see
---
that's not an argument. but you can bet I'm angry we're getting this stupid trait again.
---
I have been ignoring anything with a lock in this game as forever, now I can see all the crap and junk inside and sell some cards.
---
did some extensive testing of that last night w/ two other people.
---
it indeed appears to be fixed.
---
mine also seems to be doing a LOT more damage.
---
no, where in the world did you hear that?
---
Yup! I went through my miles stash for some troubleshooters guns and a good melee for quick swap. 
---
I had so much fun with the blood eagles.
---
Because I completely changed my character, and I'm definitely still going to be fine.  Might be 550 instead of 500.  Big deal.
---
I'm not sure without knowing your other perks. I just made a reply that shows my tests with 3 guns, a lever, a gauss and a hunting rifle.
---
They took down lv 100 enemies with 1 to 2 shots. I cant do that on my commando or heavy. 
---
But I run good perks that make sense. I run adrenal at a fair hp. I play the game the same way it's made sense to me - that my perks have some synergy to support a build. This means rifles go with sneak and covert operative. All 9 ranks of rifleman. 3 ranks of tank killer. Bloody mess.
---
Ok ty sry I didn’t know
---
They should just make an offline version already so you can console/mod it
---
Thanks 🙏
---
Workshops can also award it sometimes.
---
Not trying to be cute. You literally can not kill them without it. 
---
Bottom line is, that's your opinion, and you're welcome to it. There's plenty of creative ways around it, you just have to.. Ya know.. *be* creative. Like asking melee builds to join. 
---
Sorry you can't hold down your RT and Autowin anymore. Time to adapt! Wow.
---
It's not hard, it just soaks more bullets which is annoying
---
I still consider them new.  Regardless, if you play enough, you'll get past it and into steamroll town.
---
Damn.... But.....
---
u/kung-fu-magik meet phat potatoe
---
Oh, thank you
---
Look at their post to instagram September 8th, you'll see them saying "We couldn't think of a better outfit for the glass milestone..."
---
Bigger than me 😉
---
the same as any other automatic rifle, just make it auto.
---
Rifleman seem underwhelming.  Haven’t gone back to melee, and don’t think I will.   Kind of my point.  Now I feel like I need to be a PA, or Commando built.  Luckily I’m already geared as a hybrid shotgun/rifleman.  
---
Granted, I don’t have the legendary perks maxed or anything.  Having maxed out luck would help
---
It happens. I dropped a nuke on someone because they had a five cap bounty and were hiding in their base. They must have been afk because it hit them hard. In hindsight I'm not sure what I was trying to accomplish but I was bored.
---
It's also perfectly fine at rank 1.  Prioritize literally everything else.
---
I'm on PS4 and have not purchased levels. Thank you so much for following up!
---
Ohhhh the chainsaw would be fun for sure.
---
Sneak criticals don't work at all since the patch!
---
Fair enough, but it still shifted the cost of your mistake to your most expensive 50 levels.
---
I'm just putting this out there because well frankly, it's just better game design and ultimately *fair.*
---
Which is why I suggested in the post that update 22 increases the difficulty scaling without increasing the things (or options)  players can do to alleviate these problems.
---
Perhaps another solution is to increase the amount of ammo that drops from mobs and also or from crafting
---
It was all BOS themed stuff. Was nothing about nuka cola.
---
Small world — I’m 50 too! Reading the comments here, it seems like all of us that had our fun ruined by the patch are old timers. I grew up with tabletop RPGs and have played every Fallout since the first, and FO76 pre-patch was set to be one of my favorites. I started ESO after One Tamriel, where you can practically go everywhere and start every quest shortly after character creation. So, I was really excited to see how much more of the world One Wasteland would allow me explore at level 43, with everything scaled to be *just the right level of challenge for me*, like in One Tamriel. Imagine my surprise when I wandered out my front door and was promptly killed by a pack of wolves.
---
Maybe Bethesda should create a game mode that combines well-tuned scaling with less of a grind for resources, and let people that want a super challenging experience have their own game mode, like Nuclear Winter... Oh, wait, that’s already a thing!
---
Sounds pretty fair to me 1 to 50 is just levelling whilst 50 to 100 is getting good
---
Supposedly Beth is building towards something in future.  I saw a post that basically said 'we had to nerf damage to get things set up for future developments'
---
I wasn't very happy with that thought process, but there it is.
---
Im having a good fun time with higher level enemies, still taking them down easy but its harder in all the best ways. Running a PA bloody heavy
---
Its called Challenge for a reason.
---
Once player vending was in the game, I had no problem getting the mutations I wanted. In fact I used buying mutation recipes as a way to avoid maxing out my caps.
---
High health for sure. I use vats but hate being reliant on it considering all the bugs I've had. I would love to stick to my current melee/ shotgun combo but understand if that's no longer viable. I don't have any mutation. No legendary perks because I'm only at lvl 42. Power armor would be great and im only 3 levels from a full suit.
---
I have a very optimistic view of life.  I think this was a great update and I look forward to more challenges and learning how to handle the daily ops.  I’m excited about this.  I’m just not going to come up with a solution that makes things worse and creates more work for others.  I’m excited about new content in the future.  I’m willing to learn to adapt and change. 
---
You on the other hand, just seem to think it’s as easy as snapping fingers and making a new server, and you aren’t even considering the costs and time for them to do this.  Would it even be worth their time.  
---
I can be optimistic, but still realistic about what the effort would be.
---
I will do this.
---
Sorry I found a bug on your precious F76!   
---
Some of you reddit nerds are a joke, you understand that correct?  You downvote questions regarding legit issues people discover simply because you cant face the fact you worship a game sloppily made with issues on nearly every level.  You assume its user error in nearly every case to help ignore the facts.  
---
  If you took a moment to read my response after the first 5 people said "use melee"  you would see I noted after a ton of initial testing melee DIDNT work and it wasn't until getting out of power armor that they would finally die.   
---
What a community!

It always comes down to the higher level and experienced player condescending, doesn't it? And I say that as one. I would never dream of being so arrogant as to tell all the disappointed players who are sharing their displeasure in hopes that Bethesda will listen to basically 'join a team or git gud'. 
---
I mean, I don't really even see why you would bother posting this, as you aren't going to magically fix the grievances of an immense amount of the more casual or newer playerbase.

It’s a random drop of the nukes, I’m trying to find the video now it’s how I stumbled upon this
---
Now nobody can hide even with a stealth boy!
---
There has been zero mention of a nuka cola space suit as a reward anywhere.
---
Ok for free
---
I was hoping someone would say that lol
---
Until they change it to the same time as challenges, while going "forward" like they said yesterday..
---
The ops is a mess right now.. It says Super Mutants in Valley Galleria, but my team got  Robots in Burning Mine and AGAIN needed to melee them to death...
---
Looking at it now. Not intended to be reward, seems like a stretch to think that's what they were saying.
---
The explosions are like a grenade going off, and they can hurt you also. It does seem to proc more often than it says, but it's not 100% for me. I equipped a ranked up fireproof card at the same time I got the fireworks, so the explosions aren't giving me any trouble. 
---
I haven't tried swapping the card, I hope it won't get stuck for me!
---
I thought the intent was to to make it where everyone damages the creature separately, as if the creature was their level? I think that is the design. You might be having problems with the tweaks they did to damage and armor.
---
Yeah I generally stick with one character. But it would be fun to start another character.
---
yes, they told us that yesterday.
---
It's not working even without that perk or Chameleon armor.
---
I guess there's a truth in what you said. Looting and grinding is a part of Fo76 and maybe players just have to deal with the increase of the need to loot and grind.
---
There is an event planned...can’t remember the name but lots of goodies
---
I think the best way would be make it optional, and free.  Always get a perk each level, and have one optional respec every so much xp gained, and give everyone who used the old respec system that many perk card choices back.
---
Tag what you need to repair your gear and make food/drinks.    
---
Keep your CAMP simple. Store only what you need and sell the rest. Store some food/drink that doesn't spoil. Any drops you get that can be sold sell or script but make your prices reasonable.    
---
Before selling to any vendor pop something that increases your CHA.
---
They sell it at the soda counter inside the Whitespring resort, there's a fresh bottle every time you server hop. It's upstairs to the right, then back on the left when you go in the main entrance.
---
Do you mean the Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit that already has been available several times? That just sounds like they were posing with a costume that was appropriate for the Event, not saying people will get it.
---
My armor stay breaking, I spend more caps on ballistic fiber scrap than anything else in this game.
---
We got that memo but I think a lot of others might have missed it...
---
I would imagine they plan to add more modes to the daily ops, I'm also hoping that we get something at the glassed cavern that way we can have a boss room big enough to house super mutant behemoths, mirelurk Queens and hopefully in the future we can get something like the legendary deathclaw from F:NV.
---
But then we’d have an actual functioning economy. I won’t allow anyone to try and bring civilization back to my wasteland
---
using melee weapons or spamming bash is not creative. it's literally as brain dread as you're implying 'just hold down RT' is. there are several ways to play around freezing enemies, but with resilient it's either or.
---
piercing gaze is another example of terrible design. it's not making it harder for sneak builds in some creative way that they can possibly work around, it's literally just shutting them out altogether.
---
there's nothing to adapt. the alt key has always been there.
---
Those of us struggling paid for the game too.  You going to refund me?  Keep yakking if so.  If not, then your opinion has been noted, and disregarded.
---
i just grabbed a piece out of a vendor. i dont like wearing PA so was gonna build a set for daily ops, looks like it wasnt changed from players to humans though
---
is this for Bethesda, or us?
---
That’s what I’ve taken to doing: scavenging every bit of ammo I can find and converting it to what I need. I can never find lead and no one seems to sell it. I’m always on the hunt for a pencil!!
---
Yea the dude who nuked my camp did it for a laugh. I thought it was pretty funny too, just watching everything crumble all at once after I fast traveled in.
---
Hmmmm lemme see. . . are you aware they updated enemy line of sight functuon? Sounds funny but i can shadow touch someone from behind in hidden but if i boop the snoot of a ghoul im in danger.
---
Sorry chief. Its a nuclear wasteland. Not the best place for tiptoeing through the tulips. Exploration leads to combat. Combat can kill you. Don't like fighting enemies that can actually hurt you? Well, I don't know what to tell you. Running around killing enemies with a whacker is funny, sure. Not really a point to it, but if that's how you enjoyed playing, sorry that was taken away. But as I said, it's a nuclear wasteland. Its not a playground. Exploring isn't a chore, it's just the way it should be now. Not super easy with no actual fights that make you put in effort.
---
But I'm sure the rewards are more important than the ammo a lot.
---
\*\*\* "over 200" \*\*\*
---
Yes that's what I mean, from the post it sounded like they would additionally add that as an reward so I was confused on that
---
I just entered the op and it sent me to valley galleria with super mutants, dunno what happened on your end.
---
He hasn’t given me a daily quest for about a week now   :( he was broken for me before the update. Yesterday he was just humming while I tried to speak to him, so rude!
---
Yes, we had it super good back then! Plus amazingly helpful high level players. Newbies right now are getting annihilated.
---
My stealth build surprisingly hasn’t taken too much of a hit - handmade with multiple stealth bonuses doesn’t one shot a lot of enemies anymore, but I can still kill them before they start shooting back (thank you fast fire rate of handmade), all I’ve noticed is I have to shoot more. Even high level mutants are down in a couple seconds.
---
most people are happy not because of the nerf, not because it separates low levels from high levels (though in my opinion, I like that it separates high levels from low levels as long as there is no level 1 at a colossal problem I'm fine). most people are happy about this because it makes the wasteland, a game set after the end of the world to be a fight to survive, it's a return to the old fallout way. something new players who only played fallout 4 won't understand. the game is more challenging, it's more bone dry, it's more of a fight for survival, not just a fairy tale land anymore. most people who have been with, fallout from 3 to now, have seen and done everything in those games will be happy with this because it is hard, it is rough, it makes you angry, but most of all it makes fallout,... fallout. something new players won't ever understand.
---
But that’s my point.  I went in with shitty characters and yes, they are taking a few more shots.  But the enemies in the forest are still super easy.  A well placed head shot is still killing most of the enemies.  It’s still easy, this helps people level up.  Once you’re level 50+ enemies in the forest will never be more than level 50. They are super easy.  You’ll still have something easy. It just take more than one bullet.
---
Would love something like this!
---
At the very least, call them a boat anchor.
---
And in Project Paradise and on tamed pets at your camp.
---
Perk loadouts pushed to 2021 lol. A pc mod fixed this in the first couple months of the games release. Wtf Bethesda,
---
Keep an eye on the market in a bit it may come up 😶 not by me as I gotta wait 3 more days to post on it but it may be up in a bit
---
The perks that give you extra SPECIAL points are great. The points they give you actually count toward equipping additional regular perk cards.
---
👏👏 STIMPAK JELLO SHOTS 👏👏
---
See what I mean? XD Stop wasting perk points in dumb stuff.
---
I am torn. I also like the struggle, but at the same time like a sense of accomplishment. We got the former, lost the latter IMO
---
Well I was co confused about it cause why would they do that lmao, I feel new players would assume they would get that reward as well
---
This is true, it doesn't require a lot of thinking to figure out which perks you want, but it does require a lot of effort in the sense you will have to grind out levels to be able to move/acquire perks, and most of all, even if your build is done, you still have to grind/pray to the RNG gods/trade for the loot to match that build. And people spend literally months looking for gear. Simply switching to a better build is a time consuming process.
---
No, I am talking about last Sunday, just before P22 hit.
---
It's been halloween in the Fallout universe for almost 200 years!
---
Exactly.  This guys definition of “fine” is having to kill an enemy in 20 hits since apparently he has no builds, no legendaries and nothing else apparently.    Bullet sponges aren’t “fun”.   There’s a balance between what’s fine in a game and what amounts to fun.
---
1. It works
---
2. It works
---
3. Rumors (again, like 20 times over the past 6 months) about this glitch. No proof yet on it.
---
Even if it was, if you’re on a team you get to loot it anyways.
---
What? Lol
---
You do the op's with a team...pfffft...noob!😉😂
---
oh alright, thank you!
---
"New Armor" in Winter.
---
What are the odds they can't even wait a year to make Secret Service Armor not top-of-the-line? That's far too much Power Creep too fast if it's true.
---
It's a timed event, too bad, I don't care.
---
Mate, who have you been talking to!? Haha.
---
I don't think he's my type..
---
Yeah, At lowers levels I absolutely dreaded seeing a higher level pop up near me. The first 30 or 40 levels I did everything I could to avoid other players.
---
You speak like this change took place in a vacuum.  It did not.  Some of us, possibly even most of us, were doing fine before the nerf.  I didn't get to level 60 in a month or so by being bad at the game.
---
The problem is that my build depends on an initial strike that takes the target down to manageable levels.  Now that that's not possible I can't play the way I built my character to play.  I'm not one of those power armored hopping juggernauts running all over the map willy-nilly.  I prefer to take my time and take out the opponent one at a time, ideally without them knowing I'm around.
---
Can't do that anymore, so what I'm faced with is a choice between abandoning my character and writing off all the time I spent building a certain tactical methodology, or completely changing the way I play for one I frankly don't like.  If I wanted to be hopalong cassidey, I'd play Titanfaill or Overwatch.
---
It's not a happy choice, and it wasn't necessary.
---
Sorry cant launch anymore busy fucking running around trying to find lead and acid for more fucking ammo.
---
Lordy. No wonder someone gave me their life savings for one!
---
Can't say I see too many people making that mistake, if I'm being honest.
---
You’re making a great point here. I think a lot of the players who like this change are the ones fortunate enough to already have established OP builds like bloodied and have all the best gear for those builds. They made the game easy for themselves. That doesn’t warrant punishment for the majority of players because the top 5% want the game to be harder. 
---
Truth is not ONE of those players would want to start that same build from ground zero in these conditions. It would be nearly impossible. The problem is some of those players won’t admit this because they’re tied to some egoic belief that their op build is a result of them being better at the game, when the truth is it’s mostly about who has more more time, luck, and willingness to use exploits or buy gear with real life money.
---
Honestly, maybe he should have his chair changed to a crib lmao.
---
That too, complaining that you finished too fast is weird lol
---
Yeah, git gud and shut your gob hole Praxius!
---
I do understand why stealth would break daily ops. but my point is that a better game designer would find ways to work around this, without shutting it down completely. instead we get piercing gaze.
---
being snarky won't change the fact it's a terrible mechanic. I have no problem soloing these. I just despise resilient. there objectively is nothing to adapt to, unless you can't find your bash key.
---
The first time I did it I got lost and had to fend off a giant horde of robots all on my own. Luckily we still got elder
---
how old are you?
---
Shattered is regularly updated. It's a great rogue lite.
---
Have you tried melee or shotguns?
---
Why bulk though, other than to sell?
---
Are you on Xbox? I'll trade it for something good or caps...
---
I know but hes so worked up i had to poke him!
---
As a fully stealth commando I love you my melee man! I was in an ops where i was only useful punching bots next to a tank like you. I loved being helpful but not dominating. As a team player im so happy everyone is getting a turn to shine!
---
Heavy and commando were the least nerfed.  But Heavy PA doesn't say much.  You could be junkies or even bloodied as heavy PA.  
---
Glad your setup still works though.
---
I wanted to rip the band-aid off and just get it all done at once. It feels good now having it done, and having all those perk coins to spend right off the bat.
---
But it was straight torture.
---
He was slow as hell.
---
When was that change made, I haven't played in a while
---
Make some adjustments is not condescending. It just means adjust your play style. You can still go it alone just be more cautious. 
---
And I post this for the same reason that others post how much they hate it and are ‘going to quit if it doesn’t change’. 
---
I don’t want a change and There are others like me. Bethesda should hear that too. Both sides should be heard so that changes land in the middle and hopefully every player can enjoy their time in the Wasteland. 
---
Also, I would never utter the phrase, “Git Gud”.
---
I feel like I would know of EP wasn't working on my armor.  It definitely is working
---
The true reward was the memories you made along the way.
---
Or Meat Festival.
---
I mean u loose half your damage but with ammo factory you make more than double
---
Im 28. Ill be 29 in a fortnight. Not like the game you seem to be confusing fallout with.... Like the time span
---
Stealth anything.
---
🤔...both 🤷 sorry but I'm failing to understand your question
---
gauss miniguns are probably the least affected by the nerf.
---
Good luck with that, you gotta pray every day that the rng gods will bless you with a weapon that does decent damage. And until then you gotta pull up with the new changes
---
Ohhhh. I finally get to rock my lights!
---
Ok, that would be super useful, but are we not getting the thing I'm talking about? I want to restart my character without spending 30 perk points. :(
---
That was supposed to be what One Wasteland did. It's the same thing that happens in ESO.
---
While its great for your build it's an absolute godsend for heavy gun Power Armor builds . These legendary perks are fantastic.
---
These are the most satisfying wins. I have the reflexes of a potato but have been overseer many times because of that lovely scorchbeast.
---
Not really, it was the power
---
Ah okay I feel kinda dumb should've assumed it cured something. Thank you all
---
Are they actually doing anything for Halloween?
---
This more of a general question and less for the OP.
---
So what’s the bombs drop event?
---
If there is new weapons i want the m72 gauss rifle and the gauss rifle from fo3 the one in the base game looks like garbage
---
Honestly, there's very little difference for me since one Wasteland, and the differences that I have noticed are positive. The only real difference that I see is that 70 percent of the map used to feel irrelevant and a waste of time.  I never bothered with Uranium fever because  I didn't want another level 35 weapon.  One Wasteland fixes this and that's about it. I seriously don't understand the complaints about it being so much harder, being more of a grind, etc.  That just hasn't been my experience. I am a non-bloodied, power armor heavy weapons build.  I don't know if my build just wasn't hit that hard or what, but I am not having any problems.
---
Build water purifiers at your camp, industrial, as many as you an (10 is good).  Collect every hour at a minimum, sell.  You can get an easy 500 caps an hour with only the cost of initially building the purifiers
---
I liked your damage numbers reply- I wrote the numbers down as goals.  I put away my Fixers and have been REALLY enjoying my Instigating Lever and  Quad Gauss again. Glad I didn't sell them...just have to tweak perks a bit more.
---
What is the mutation?
---
Level 32 started playing after Fo76 hit game pass.
---
I’m a pretty casual player so I didn’t pay attention to making a build until recently. If anything I’m close to melee build. I’m not interested in using PA, but my armor keeps getting obliterated after the update.
---
[fo76 build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e354444&amp;d=sv1sb0sf1s41s60s51sa0sg1ss0pa0p80p60e11e40e60eo0c30c10cl0cr0i10i41ic0a71s70a80l91la0lc0&amp;am=-1c---&amp;wp=w2w5&amp;wm=-)
---
People like you are the best part about MMOs! Some games are full of players who get super-salty if you don’t play in a very specific way, and it’s really good to see that there are people in FO76 that can embrace cooperation instead of competition. I love that you encourage playing *to have fun*, because that’s so easy for people to forget in times like these! I don’t have the money to give you an award, so please accept a psychic hug instead.
---
Idk why people can’t just flip some cards and weapons around, I do it like 4 times a day lol ppl are too reliant on one build/weapon
---
Redundant, as there's one at the whitespring, but useful.
---
Yeah, I've heard a lot of players with similar views. I personally enjoy a good drawn out fight but I can see how being forced to play a way you don't want to can be frustrating. I've had days on a 60+ hour work week where I just wanted to hop on, do some quick Killing and hop off.
---
Good suggestion - I hadn't even considered those bonuses. Do you what at what percent you stop being well fed and hydrated?
---
I literally have 4 characters because respecing isn't in the game, it's so lame losing progress on your Main because you want to play a different build.
---
I run the exact same build and guns but legendary modifiers do not cut it anymore. I need Corn soup, tato juice, overdrive, megasloth soup and ballistic Bach on me at all times or my DPS on earl / queen is laughable
---
Heavy builds just are not viable outside of daily Ops for the time being and that's the issue.
---
The rewards from colossal problem were no problem but now that I'm using 12-13 not 5-6 UA plasma cores a run the cost is getting unreasonable.
---
I don't want to have to farm just for the sake of being able to play the game.
---
I avoided scaly skin because of the ap loss.  Is the loss even noticeable?
---
You can effectively get enough anti armor plus the bloodied effect, so everyone getting anti armor weapons eventually will find out they're still trash.
---
I am but my buddy has a decent idea of what its worth is hes at a job interview rn tho he's my trade guy lol
---
The solution is literally what I posted, lol. If scaling stops after a point, it's fair in that a linear amount of time invested can fix a character.
---
I really want the ability to drop and place items from my inventory into my camp ala Fallout 4. It would significantly improve the enjoyment of scavenging.
---
Ya, sneak was great but now I end up just taking 1 maybe 2 before it turns into me fighting mobs point blank. If I didn't have my trusty shotgun I would be slaughtered. And I love the ammosmith perk card. But I blew through  160ish 308 yesterday just working on challenges. It's just depressing that I almost died to moles Because my ap was low, my shotgun broke on the previous fight and I could not freaking hit them. Challenging is great but it's also fun to destroy trash mobs too.
---
Hell no
---
Yep. You get one chance to roll for rare rewards.
---
Each tier has it's own roll percentage chance; sometimes you'll get nothing, if you luck out you'll get three.
---
With Class Freak, which you should be running if you use mutations, it's only -12 AP. Nothing really noticable.
---
I think so, yeah. I ran it a couple more times yesterday after getting the elder rewards and never got anything great. Could have just been a cursed RNG on my end, though.
---
Okay, but my point is that a week for everyone is 7 days. Even Work Weeks, because there is a weekend (or two other days off) in that time, making it seven days. Days begin and end at Midnight, giving 24 hours each day. Meat Week day 1 begins at Noon, giving 12 hours that day. Meat Week day 7 ends at Noon, giving 12 hours that day. That leaves 12 hours missing each day. Hence, not a full week. 
---
Maybe it's "too literal" but I'm not stupid if others can't see that 24 hours missing from a week isn't a full week. Literal definition of week or not, it's not a seven day span of time.
---
I haven't heard anything as well (events,rewards,ect.) If that's what you're referring to
---
Oh, that scaling.  Yeah, I agree.  Maybe after 300 like you said.  I thought you meant there should be a max level.
---
I'll have to start a new toon to see if theres any issue with lowbies, but i have 2 level 250ish toons and i havnt noticed anything but more XP per kill.
---
How about boosting your weaker stats? You could add charisma or intelligence to use lone wanderer or nerd rage, for example. Or strength to get more carry weight.
---
Among us, and cube escape series
---
I have a vamp ex handmade and it is a god roll for daily ops. Enemies melt and you just keep on trucking, even at low health. If you don’t keep it get a good price
---
Thanks, I'm defo gonna implement Rejuvenated into my build - have you got a go-to food to keep yourself well fed?
---
Stimpak syringer ammo really doesn't sound that far fetched considering there is ammo to make deathclaws talk
---
That's it for today then. It's not guaranteed plan reward if you succeed. You get one chance per rank. Elder has 80% chance and if you have not finished the other ranks (first run for this day) then you get the previous rank rolls aswell (5% and 10%). You just had bad luck. Like myself.
---
seems really odd.. i have a 2 handed mele build and ive not had any additional issues except more XP
---
Interesting info.  Kind of casual player that leans into Melee build / though been leaning towards shotgun build (friend runs bloody and would easily one shot enemies in past so looked promising).  Start off that this was my fault and I should have quit.  Got the High Carry weight backpack from Scouts.  Evidently that makes you more susceptible to energy weapon damage and I should have quit there which would have meant Modding backpack and trying to reduce what carrying.  Didn't think about that when started up Daily Ops couple of days ago.  Thought that might act like a public event where people would join in.  Soloed entire thing that took 50 long minutes of dying over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.  Slowly fought way and considered giving up many times but I had used up so much ammo and stimpacks.  Melee definitely didn't seem to hit as hard as past even though I have several of those Perk Cards to help.  3 of my 4 Secret Service armor limbs broke during fight.  Trash reward but at least got some Score right ?  Having to use so much ammo and healing will help that economy and perk cards.  Feel so much more of time is going to be saving up for fights now.  Makes less prone to wanting to do SBQ or big daddy Earl if gunna drain all my resources.  Does make want to play something else instead.
---
Pretty sure something like that is coming in winter dude
---
Just had to completely rebuild my new camp from the ground up as a result of this damn skin. Didn't make a single sale for 4 days, my teammate kept asking me what the hell was wrong with my camp. Not to mention, because of the skin, Beckett was stuck in one spot outside and would not go to his bar no matter what I did. I was pretty pissed when I discovered the problem was something as simple as a camp skin, and even more pissed when Tuesday's update dropped and the problem still persisted. So, begrudgingly, I moved my camp to the same exact spot, rebuilt the same exact house from the ground up (I live on a slope so I couldn't place my house blueprint as apparently half of its foundations were floating), and the only thing I changed was removing the camp skin. And ta-da, everything was magically fixed. I was back to hearing that glorious "cha-ching" from making sales and Beckett was back to his bar business. Even my pet Deathclaw seems happier. My point is... all of that over a camp skin? Really?
---
Treetops! Unless I'm behind on this one, i swear I went there last week and it was completely empty. Went yesterday and its occupied with villagers and built up more
---
Edit: lol not treetops sorry 🤦🤦 Treehouse village
---
THANK YOU for this post OP!
---
I joined the Fallout genre about 3 weeks ago when I was suddenly diagnosed with an incurable disease.  
---
I played fairly casually, trying to discover and learn about the game as I went, making decisions about my SPECIAL points and cards as best I could.  I tried venturing out to some further areas early on, but realised there were like big mutant soldiers and mole men things and others.  So I have been limiting myself to a small-ish area and doing some quests.
---
I've been picking up and using guns and armour and upgrading them the best I can when I can.  Before the the update, I had the best guns &amp; armour I could possibly have.  I switched off my laptop when I reached lvl 25 and went to bed.
---
Then the update came.
---
Suddenly, my armour would break and I ran out of ammo on guns I had \~1,000 rounds on.  In an hour, 7x rats and 2 mirelusks killed me 5 times.  I had 2 complete sets of armour broken, my guns broke and I ran completely out of materials to even craft more repairs, new armour or ammo.  Nothing drops useable stuff anymore either.
---
When I started mentioning this all I got was "crap build" or "git gud" from the usual boring goon squad.  But the trouble is, it was an area I operated in quite comfortably (being careful to avoid crazy risks).
---
I feel better that at least you've highlighted this.  
---
Yeah, I am a little salty.  I enjoyed the game so much.  In a time when I am facing declining health, the game was a nice distraction.  But suddendly I am killed off by RATS.
---
I'll put it down until a balance patch comes out.  If one comes out.  
---
I just wish the devs had tested it better and I wish that the boring goon squad with their golden uber god armour and trillion DPS guns that shoot lightning bolts that can kill the entire map in one shot weren't so quick to point out how superior they all are and actually take these complaints seriously.
---
At least I know I am not alone and that helps.  Good luck everyone - here's to hoping we all get to enjoy Appalacia Radio soon :)
---
Thanks for the suggestion - I think if I stop using an armour piece with the similar effect I'll defo give it a shot. The stim drain running bloodied is reallllll
---
My buddy said possibly able to get a legacy out of it not to sure how true that it is but ima let him try to get me my first heavy legacy good luck iknow 😂
---
Yup, good RPG design has zones that you eithet can or can't explore depending on your lvl. I've played RPG's in some form or another from the mid 90's, and level scaling is the worst.
---
I wish I kept my instigating lever to test with! Gave it to a newer player who hopefully is enjoying it and didn't rage quit with my rifle after One Wasteland!
---
Ive seen a couple nukes yesterday, not as often as before but people are probably just gettingused to the changes.
---
Just an unlucky day, I guess...
---
People have asked for this with their 21821767% damage amplified builds. I had stopped playing because I couldn't even hit any mob before it died before this patch. Now I can land bullets before something dies to a bloodied gauss shotgun wielded by an invisible croucher.
---
0.1sec TTKs are never healthy for any game, even pure shooters, much less RPGs. Either all the bloodied etc mods will be removed from the game or we'll get bullet sponges to counter that.
---
One caveat on Charisma; your ability to share perk cards stays based upon the non-legendary stat. So if you have a Cha of 4 and maxed Legendary Charisma (+5), even though it looks like you have a Charisma of 9,  you can’t share a Rank 3. You can only share a Rank 1.  You’ll be able to equip up to 9 ranks of perk cards, though. 
---
To get around this, move points from another stat to Charisma and bolster the other stat back up with its Legendary version.
---
You would still get the other benefits of higher Charisma, like lower buy/higher sell values. Look at it like a piece of gear that adds the SPECIAL for that particular function.
---
The chance of getting a rare reward for completing Elder rank is 80%.
---
Tell this to lower level players.
---
While this update may not have affected the game in any negative way for players levels 60+, the game is nearly impossible for those just getting into the game. The ammo economy is a *major* struggle. I started a new player just out of curiousity and using the 10 mm pistols and hunting rifles were not useful whatsoever like they were when I first started. And if I was having a tougher time... I can't imagine how players brand-new to the game feel.
---
Was just about to say pixel dungeon
---
Sounds good. I've been using a vampire explosive combat rifle and would like that same thing in a handmade. Shoot me a pm when you figure out what you want for it. Thanks
---
Dang, nevermind, there's always tomorrow.

I run solar, suppressor, tenderizer, team medic, and enforcer. ]

Lock enemies down, heal teammates and reduce damage dealt and increase damage taken by enemies.
---
I actually didn't know they gave out TNs thank you oh my God
---
You know what, I am too. I can always resubscribe if they fix this bullshit.
---
Tree tops has been empty for a long time, if there are living people there then yeah that's shocking to hear. I am super happy that the team just slid in these changes for people to discover.
---
At least 2-3 people are ok, tho we encpuntered nasty bug, its just outright stopped mooving, and after awhile it complets, only second reward
---
Exactly, if it was a huge thing like the vendors being broken or a certain power method breaks the camp then I could sort of understand but a skin for an item and not even a massively impressive one!
---
Never has worked for me. On the flip side, when I delete his chair, I get a message that I've abandoned an ally's quest, though no quest was listed. Strange.
---
How about inside the vault?
---
Do you use vats? It doesn’t show up in vats, but does without vats. At least that’s my experience and what I’ve saw other people say. It should work fine.
---
It was the first run, you got two rares in one day? That's super lucky.
---
It’s frustrating at times just how close you have to stay.  In a recent one I was where I swore should still count.  Like.  It was right over there.    But I looked up and it wasn’t counting me.  Bah.  Had to run over and hug it.
---
Was in power armor during Uranium Fever. Accidentally held A. Instantly ate shit
---
I really liked having the low-level areas because then I could just wander around and look for things without worrying about being killed in two shots
---
Alot of people seem to dislike it. I think it's great. I turned my bloodied build into a more tanky build due to enemies being harder. 
---
It baffles me that people actually want to 1-2 shot bosses.
---
My commando (using a mutant’s handmade) can 2-3 shot enemies.  My unarmed build can 2-3 shot enemies.  My Shotgun build can 2-3 shot enemies.  My sniper is the only one that needs a slight tweak, but even then, she’s 4-5 shooting things now.  These aren’t bullet sponges.  I’m not using amazing builds.  I’m not wearing amazing gear.  
---
4-5 shots is fine.  2-3 shots is fine.
---
If you aren’t 2-3 shot killing enemies after this change, I once again state you have to be that inept at video games and/or intentionally nerfing yourself and building the worst character you can.
---
Some people have more money than sense, I swear.
---
I always run vats. Is the perk worthless when using vats?
---
Just shoot them and they will turn and come for you instead.
---
I am so excited with where this game is heading. I kinda got burnt out during The Legendary Run but I've been hooked ever since One Wasteland. I feel like theres so much to do and look forward to as a high level player now. Hopefully they can tweak One Wasteland a bit so lower level and less-optimized builds can still have a good time. Also hoping for a Halloween and Thanksgiving event. Lastly, I am hoping 76 gets an optimization for those of us moving to next gen consoles.
---
There’s an issue with the rollover.  I got robots with resilient in vault 94 yesterday.  After the first time, it changed to explosive blood eagles.
---
I've seen that happen quite a bit but when I deleted his chair, nothing like that popped up as if there wasn't a quest in the first place.
---
I missed mischief night last year super excited to get to do it  ! Strange that they chose white springs instead of jacks pumpkin house for that particular event though.
---
Yeah my bad I meant Treehouse Village, sorry 🤦 I always get them mixed up
---
Of course I chose my perks carefully too. I got 9 ranks of Rifleman, 3 ranks of Tank Killer, Sneak and Covert Operative as well as 1 of Escape Artist and 2 of Mister Sandman. I also tested a Mole Boi gauntlet with Ninja before the patch, otherwise I have Action Girl equipped for better VATSing. The rest are mostly carry weight perks and stuff like Concentrated Fire, Lone Wanderer and one rank of Grimm Reaper's Sprint for my one Luck point.
---
I haven't been able to test the changes yet but I honestly don't see much I'd switch for something else. Maybe Mister Sandman, since they already "nerfed" the night duration in the previous patch and now its effect is probably almost negligible. Regardless it's good to hear that rifleman builds are still viable with a proper setup, thank you member.
---
gary
---
Well, I for one love my new One Wasteland overlords. I think these changes are great.
---
You are correct! And I really hope people won’t fall for it and start buying the repair and scrap kits with their atoms to make up for the changes, because then the cash-grab will have won. Cosmetics are one thing, but when they increase the number of resources needed to succeed and *let you pay real money to get them*, that’s when a business practice becomes sketchy.
---
But it would be sweet to have a kiss my ass taunt.
---
I've played all the Fallouts (except Tactics and BoS), as well as NV and 4 in Hardcore mode. And no, it was never this hard.
---
Except for maybe 1 and 2, your build and where you put perk points into didn't matter nearly as much as 76. In 76, choosing Lockpick instead of Commando now is enough to ruin any fighting chance you have.
---
The difficulty of 76 wouldn't be so bad if all the online restrictions weren't also a challenge, namely scrap limits, health rubberbanding, and desync.
---
The other Fallout's all had harder and easier zones, difficult fights and places you could return to later after you leveled up. Fights like the Sierra Army Depot, or Quarry Junction, Washington DC, Glowing Sea, or that Goose guy from 4. You could choose to risk it early for loot, or come back later when your decked out.
---
This held true for 76 as well. I remember being only level 18 and risking my way into the Savage Divide to find some good legendaries. I also remember not venturing into the Ash Heap until I was in the later lvl20s, because I wanted to have an easier time.
---
But One Wasteland ruined that. Sure, the entire wasteland feels like a wasteland, but if we're going off of how it "should" feel, then shouldn't experience gained from surviving in the wasteland help you out? After killing mole rats in the Forest for days, shouldn't I get better at it, especially as I get better guns and armor and chems?
---
Why should the brain-dead animals and creatures learn with me? That just makes no sense.
---
I don’t know why people are complaining if your having trouble switch up your build they come after the bloodieds every update guess what some of us still do over 400+ if what your doing doesn’t work switch it up
---
My opinion of the update is admittedly tainted by the fact that I am a high-level with a fairly optimized build. I am generally okay with the changes and feel that the game needed some restructuring with the math. The gap between the weak and the strong was an enormous divide. I still think they screwed up with their scaling of the enemies coinciding with the damage changes. 
---
It feels like the devs don't understand their own game, or the player base, very well. Every game is going to have its hardcore players but I think fallout as a series is a bit unique in its concentration of casual players. This is yet another example of Fallout 76's design straying further away from what (many) people want out of a fallout game.
---
That said, I love this buggy hodgepodge mess of a game. I often joke to my friends that Fallout 76 is my favorite bad game ever lol.
---
You do get perk points. Pick a card, scrap it. Perk coins!
---
That's not a good build lmao a food build is anyone with thru hiker or good with salt on who doesn't have adrenaline or bloody mess maxed 
---
Food build mindset is inventory management over DPS.
---
In PvP context if you have 4 people sharing rejuvenated the whole team gets 100% DR making people angry and riflegaming to cry
---
You're just full of wit and insight aren't you?
---
Hawkes Refuge has now turned into Daggers Den. A massive blood eagle settlement. Way bigger than I thought it would be.
---
Another PSA: If you are using Perks load out mod, it has been updated on Nexus and works perfectly.
---
Should go great in my mini Silent Hill clinic.
---
GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!! HE DID IT!!
---
No it works in vats it just doesn’t show the notification in the top left when you’re in vats. Shoot something outside of vats and you’ll see the notification top left.
---
Its a nuclear wasteland bro, not the best place to choose to goof around. Its about time it felt like a nuked apocalyptic world.
---
I'm hoping that will be legendary power armor coming along with the Brotherhood. Even if it is just new set bonuses for specific paints on existing sets or something. I could stand T-65 being outclassed as more tolerable than secret service armor being surpassed, since power armor was just a gold grind, but SS was a RNG crapshow grind through hundreds of modules.
---
All you said was 100% true (kinda), but you can't expect people to know all the mechanics of the daily ops after it's been out for 3 days. Not all of us follow the news, follow youtubers, go to PTS etc..
---
Well this sounds more like a problem with the mode not working as they said it would.  In other words, Bethesda said the enemies would be scaled to your level. But it sounds like they are not properly scaled to low level players.  That sucks and it needs to be fixed.  For high level players though, I think it should stay as is.
---
Hopefully it will just be a nice mid to high tier armor that’s available more easily than SS, without surpassing it.
---
Alternatively, an armor that is superior in one category (maybe built in explosion/fire resistance?) so that certain builds are drawn to it. 
---
Otherwise I agree. The grind for the latest S-tier armor shouldn’t feel like wasted time with every major update.
---
Games not ment to be easy it fun to have a challenge
---
I really, really want the hay bale spiders that are already in game.
---
There's a house on the southern edge of the savage divide with two of them on the front lawn.
---
Especially on online games
---
But it still 15 Maximum, so for builds that have already 15 STR, it is useless or not?
---
It was tough, I died a lot but I had fun. The update has made me reevaluate my stance on mutations and meta builds, been playing for 20 months and made it to lvl 205 with out em. Before the update I felt the game was easy enough that I didn’t need to run mutations or a meta build but now it seems you need to take every edge you can get over the enemy.
---
Idea #1  - put out halloween stuff Oct 1.
---
I need time to build!
---
I’m enjoying the update personally, and excited. I just turned 600 lead that I farmed in about 25 minutes into 9600 5.56 rounds. 
---
If there’s an increased demand for ammo, I’m sure myself and others will be happy to keep our vendors stocked for our customers.
---
I run max white knight and max gunsmith always.  Learning I needed to do that was when I ‘mentally leveled up’ on playing fallout.  And got to focus on missions and leveling and having fun.  Versus constantly going looking for screws and ballistic fabric.  
---
I used to also run 1 level each of the luck perks that fix your armor/weapons randomly.  I don’t anymore because I can afford the fixing costs and at 200% durability
---
Indeed 😐
---
The HK gauss rifle was a really rare refined version and the one we have now was sort of retconned in as a prototype. I would also like to see a NV style gauss rifle like the HK version, since we will have BoS  coming from California where it was more common.
---
While your at it, remember the end boss is the only enemy you have to kill. 
---
The Mission is the uplink. When one completes go to the next, don't hang about trying to clear all the enemies.
---
On behalf of everyone who hates the fact that there is PVP in Fallout please go play Nuclear Winter lol
---
I am joking of course, I get that workshop PVP is a valid thing. Even if I hate it.
---
&gt; A level 50 hunting rifle, with no mods gains 75% more damage over a level 1 hunting rifle.
---
Over that same level difference, a level 50 scorched gains over 720% more health.
---
They do some of the dumbest things over there. Like they don't understand their own systems and that this would need to be addressed all at the same time.
---
I can understand PA, but not hazmat. So no need to "rush" through.
---
Thats why It burns stimpacks. Took 1 point of radiation? Say goodbye to a stim. Ate something that gives you rad? Another stim goes by.
---
Add field surgeon for the ultimate combo
---
First ever run too, but I had my fingers crossed for the symptomatic
---
you can keep playing after you fail but once you achieve elder rank, you either get a rare reward (80% chance) or you don't - but that's your only shot at it for the day
---
Never thought about that angle. Didn't see the need to rank it up at once, now I know I won't, unless they patch a fail safe into it. Nothing like msg'ing a friend "hey, will you kill me real quick?".
---
The update skewed things too far in the other direction for newer players. The update isn't simply black-and-white good/bad. It totally depends on what level you are and what build you are.
---
I like the idea of the update, but it needs some serious tweaking. Their whole intent was to provide increased access for lower levels and increased challenge for higher levels... but they've made the game nearly impossible for players just starting the game.
---
Heavy gunner is definitely better
---
freezing
---
I’m talking about the main effect.
---
If true it isn't about builds, but this should never happen:
---
*A level 50 hunting rifle, with no mods gains 75% more damage over a level 1 hunting rifle.
---
Over that same level difference, a level 50 scorched gains over 720% more health.*
---
I'm enjoying it (: I think the complainers are just louder, that's all.
---
True, I'm a VATS Plasma Caster main, it is 25%FFR/AA.
---
Was not working like that, the buff replenished itself keeping max level using it once, so 29mins of 99 strength, one bench press and timer was again at 30 min
---
&gt;I was in a group that almost failed Tea Time, of all things.
---
That is AWESOME.
---
I love having a dozen challenging events instead of what, one or two?
---
There's no game without a challenge.
---
True
---
I Carry 200+ stims pretty much all the time
---
Yes please! Take my upvote!
---
They are not smart enough to calculate how many level ups, perk card packs and season reward card packs each person has collected.
---
That said, i hope they hire some smart person who can achieve this. And give us a full re-spec option that resets everything i listed.
---
I'm agreed with you. The top post today details how tweaking how weapon damage is levelled during levels 20-50 could play a huge part in making the game more fun for lower levels and not affect the game experience for higher-levels at all.
---
Finally someone who sees eye to eye on more gauss weapons
---
That's lovely my progress has been forest------&gt;savage devide------&gt;mire-----&gt;almost cranberry bog---------&gt; back to being reccomended to stay near the forrest. Idk why the experience seems to different but I ran compeltley out of ammo in absolutely no time. Thats without missing a lot of shots. All I want is a happy medium ok? I don't want to feel like I have to grind the game to have fun because grinding isn't fun to me at all.
---
I suspect what you were seeing were complaints from players with superweapons and optimized builds who found everything to be too easy.
---
Now those of us who weren’t superweapon optimized but were still somewhat affected by the nerfs to multipliers—those of us who found deathclaws plenty scary prior to OW—are having an even harder time dealing with baddies that were balanced for people who can do 1-2k damage in one shot.
---
And the poor casuals... :(
---
More like the More garbage legendaries to move to the mule until I can actually scrip them surprise, but I guess that names too long. Scrip limit removes my desire to keep farming legendaries, especially with my mule already being loaded with them.
---
with a full set of vangaurd. and having sentinel, iron clad is a waste of 5 points into endurance, i would move those points somewhere more useful. 
---
past a certain damage resistance it becomes useless to gain more. and im pretty sure a full set of vanguard SS is **plenty**.
---

 &gt; Hey all, since PTS just ended Monday, we're still finalizing the list of folks who earned the PTS Pennant. We should be ready to add those to your acc...
---
&gt;Both sides should be heard so that changes land in the middle and hopefully every player can enjoy their time in the Wasteland.
---
I agree with this wholeheartedly, but  point me to anywhere in your OP you say this. In fact where you called for changes at all. You don't. You try to coax people into just accepting things and put the responsibility of them to adapt.
---
I'm not sure if it's 15 total or 15 additional points from the perks. 
---
I used my perks to boost stats I was deficient in, so I don't know.
---
I’m two-shotting max level super mutants with a junkies hunting rifle with refined .50 receiver. One shot with a vats crit.
---
Yeah, I am also a wow player, now its the same feeling with fo76
---
I know see how foolish I was after reading some of the posts. I now realize after spending hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars over the past 2 years on two GTs on Fallout 1rst subscriptions since the day it started and buying tons of atoms to have all the atomic shop items available to build a cool camp I did because I did not enjoy the game. How foolish of me. I will be sure to cancel my memberships and delete 76 to let the real game players have fun. My apologies. I'll bet I can find another franchise that wants the money. Thank you for helping me decide.
---
Oh, I get it. Never felt the need for the hazmat suit. I just don't like going into a dangerous area with no protection from damage other than rads.
---
Was just saying not everyone has access to the CSS if they have put off doing the vault. I now realize that was a mistake since I have missed out on so many treasury notes.
---
Personally i don't think im going to keep playing. 
---
Ive been grinding for hundreds of hours in order to level up and get some weapons that do damage and after getting the first gun im happy with the update hits and ruins everything. Im now having a hard time killing bloodbugs and mole rats, im wasting ammo and healing items super fast. 
---
After grinding for all these hours in order to get some decent loot i feel like ive just started the game.
---
The same issue in Fallout 4: enemies become bullet sponges. Even shooting in the head is spongey. Way to fix this: critical shots just should do more damage. I had "Better Locational Damage" in FO4 to fix this issue. It becomes awful at high levels: enemies do more damage and have larger health pools. That isn't fun gane mechanics, it's boring as hell.
---
I got the same feeling it was really nice to be on my toes a bit. Definitely makes scavenging so much more fun. Oh God don't get me started on west Tek lol that was my only leveling place, run through it server hop over and over, very fast leveling but gets a bit dull after running through it 50 times lol.  What's your build just curious?
---
Good info and a good workaround, thanks.
---
Just ran it solo and ran into nothing but bullet sponges.  Boss was just a tankier sponge with extra ammo.  I would've thanked you.
---
The newest op is un because you can actually solo it.  FireProof and Admantium skeleton for the win
---
To be fair, I don't think this mechanic is very well explained.  I didn't figure it out until my third time running the op.
---
Given the complaints last year about the lag, disconnects, etc, perhaps they've decided to use the Bombs Drop event instead?  I loved Mischief Night, but trying to work through the lag was difficult, at times.
---
I’m not really disputing that aspect. It’s just there isn’t much optimization you can really do at the start.
---
The biggest non-experience benefit I see with this new character is the legendary perks being already unlocked.
---
Pretty presumptuous.  Might as well just say “git gud” after every comment.  You’re condescending nature isn’t helpful, either.
---
Yes, because this fallout isn't fallout for the newer players. They played a fundamentally different game and liked it and now it has been taken from them. Dont get me wrong, I also like the one wasteland update...
---
But dont gatekeep the franchise dude. There is no "true" fallout, just different ones and this one just made a pretty hefty turn.
---
🤦 I can't keep up haha the one in the Mire by the crashed plane &amp; Haven Church. I recently put my camp near there and was checking out nearby locations. I could have sworn it was empty last week and yesterday it was full of people living their happy post apocalyptic lives 😊
---
I am waiting for the horde mode myself.
---
Do you mind sharing the build then? I'm just trying to enjoy the game again. And I wasn't building the worst character i can I am just trying to play it like I play any other fallout.
---
None the less.just learned the plan for the G-mini 40 legendary modules...that would be my perfect roll.nice gun.bummer about the damage but I'm sure it still rips sH!t up
---
Honestly, can we just get floor pieces that clip to the existing floors correctly?  If I’m using a full square, why is is always wanting to clip halfway on.   Who builds that way?
---
Having to rebuild my camp post update(my fault) has been a pain. I definitely feel like they tweaked things here poorly here.
---
Yesterday I had a full group. Me and one other knew the drill, 3rd guy figured it out after 2 minutes, 4th guy just kept trying to clear the first room. With all our "this way" emotes going, we all fought the endboss together.
---
Finished in 8:18. my best attempt yet. I hope people figure it out soon so I can get some rare loot.
---
No. Its in the itv when it starts
---
Aiming down the Sight
---
Plenty of mobs have WAY over 360 health.
---
I'm over level  300.
---
Are we on about the lvl  75 molerats or the max tier liberators in regards to our new overlords lol
---
This just seems unnecessary. Give people time to learn, it's been 3 days and some people have a life and don't get to play all day all the time. The world doesn't revolve around you so trying to tell people around the world how to play is well....let's just say good luck buddy. This community is great but people like you really brings things down but to each their own. Peace.
---
Contextual ammo system is up and running in Daily Ops and ACP.
---
Meaning mobs will drop ammo for the type of ranged weaon you kill them with.
---
If killed with melee, ammo drop is random.
---
Also @ Daily ops, if you wait to read the after report you have about 5 minutes to run around and loot bodies you might have missed or been too busy to loot, than you can read the report to exit.
---
DR doesn't work the way you think it does.
---
You dont even have to do that, you can still shoot them down to gun bash execute range, I got elder my second run making 0 changes to a non-PA stealth commando build which is probably one of the worst builds for that op.
---
Jip, some are very short sighted. It's fun for them now. At the moment they prob have a lot of material to make ammo, we'll see what they say once that runs out and they have to use up all the ammo they made to gather more materials for ammo. Then some will say: ez get ammo factory. Yes lets all just play the same build, the same way. Not much RP left in this RPG.
---
I've scrapped and sold all my melee weapons, gained space in inventory and stash which is something at least  🤷‍♂️
---
Well, it is taking 2-3 shots to down stuff like mutants and ghouls are 1-2 instead of one every time. Because of that, I do get caution more often and have gotten danger a couple times. Not a really big deal with all the damage avoiding perks, but it does make it so I can’t just wash/rinse/repeat through my grind spots.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
I’d try messing around wit this for a second,see what cha come up with...
---
Have you geared yourself perkwise In any specific direction?
---
He's given me a quest 3 times in all my hours playing this game. One rewarded me with an instigating Fixer so I forgive him and let him stay anyway. Just a shame the best ally never seems to work properly.
---
I’m with you, also a bit over 200 and not having as much trouble as others. But it’s undeniably too difficult for lower levels, someone literally did the math (it’s on the front page rn)
---
Anti armor was probably the one least affected from what I have seen.as far as stash items being stolen think its usually on over budget camps and things like the punchbowl or nuka machine.put those away. I got my vendors down because of max caps atm
---
I'm glad that the ammo converter exists now, since it's a bit easier to get rid of junk ammo that won't sell if you put it in a vendor.
---
I turned a character into an ammo manufacturer, all he does is collect mats for ammo then distribute to my other characters.
---
30,000 50 cal coming up sir!
---
I love how the point I'm being roasted about is getting the price of ramen wrong and not the fact that I was highlighting the weirdass comparison of TV services to a video game subscription. This sub is a barrel of misery, lol.
---
Tambourine stacker
---
Fair, thanks for the info, man :)
---
Well, I got the ammo factory perk and leveled it up, so once I farm some lead I’ll craft a bunch more ammo for it and use it like I would any other gun I guess. I’ll just miss having my “for emergencies only” super-gun.
---
I know I’ve ask this before does anybody know if this game will be compatible with the PS5?
---
I had grown quite sloppy before the patch always rushing into crazy situations head first. 
---
Now I'm required to take a moment to assess the situation and ensure I block or back away from certain enemies less they one shot me.
---
Am perfectly fine with being made to think more and strategize.
---
Considering how quickly a mod was made for perk load outs on P.C, and how long we’ve had to wait, I’ve run a real gamut from anger&gt;disbelief&gt;amusement&gt;disbelief&gt;confusion&gt;disbelief&gt;anger. It’s beyond parody at this point.
---
But this game was intended to be a grind from day one.  Once you get through the story there was nothing to do but grind.  How many times can you wander through valley galleria.  And your path still works. I’ve been testing different weapons and different styles since Tuesday, and not once have I found one where at the end of the day, I’m not walking away with enough stuff to replenish what I used.  
---
Really look and see - since Tuesday have you taken even a high level look at the situation and seen how you could fix the problem.  Have you tried getting pumpkin grenades (which you can do with no combat at all) from the pumpkin house, they increase damage enemies take.   Have you tried shooting an enemy with an endagerol syringe, that reduces their DR by 75% The two of those together should make most enemies melt.
---
Yep, good point.
---
I've kept 150 level ups, enough to completely respec my main. If stealthbuilds are no longer viable, I need them .)
---
Sorta what I was thinkin. They should've made other builds or weapons viable instead of making enemies harder with only optimal builds in mind cuz it alienates non optimal players. Its seem like a major oversight to make the enemies more difficult rather than make optimal players less OP
---
Happens to me sometimes. I just assume someone's already killed them. Are you able to try it on a private server?
---
Yeah, met a lvl 100 Yao guai a couple of days ago, I swear it laughed at the measly amount of damage I caused it.
---
Can't wait to encounter the 4 Yao guai random combo, they are going to f#$k me over lol
---
Plus it actually takes longer getting them rank 3, then scrapping, because you have to confirm the rank up twice.
---
...I realized this after ~100 cards
---
Can bash them. Don’t need melee
---
I really enjoy this sense of dread... but it's way nicer for me, because I have a solid build, good equip and mutations out the wazoo.
---
I cant imagine playing a normal every day build in this game right now. I get you, this has to change. And fast.
---
And of course, the one item we can't scrap.
---
Ya I realize. Hopefully we're wrong and there is something planned for this year if not then hopefully this can be moved to next year 🤷🎃
---
No matter how many times this line gets parroted, it won't suddenly become true of this fucking franchise. Fallout games have never been about a "hard challenge in a tough, unforgiving wasteland". Fallout 4 Survival is the hardest it ever got, and even that *entirely optional mode* was only "difficult" by Bethesda introducing shitloads of artificial difficulty into a game.
---
A fucking Rad-rat surviving a power attack from a baseball bat in the forest from a level 40 melee player should never happen.
---
Well, it would be effectively a one star, so. It was already useless? Don't be mad.
---
Ss helmet and insurgent outfit for me
---
Can you imagine when you're close to 100? Lol that's gonna suck
---
I'll give you an upvote there's nothing wrong with being sceptical.
---
I've tested it multiple times with no additional damage cards for sneak attacks, just rifleman cards and I can clarify myself and a lot of others are having the same issue.
---
I'm doing more damage while not using VATS and sneak attacking whilst the notification appears.
---
Whilst using VATS there is no notification and it's doing significantly less damage whilst trying to sneak attack.
---
Visually by bar, Visually by numbers and physically with the amount of ammo I'm using.
---
My go to was the hella duped be+1p gatling but I want that gatling mini for sure..I bet it was a nice final stand gun
---
Nope. Every level requires a bit more XP than the last, up to level 1000, then it's a flat 159,880 XP per level .

PLEASE NO. Did we learn nothing from the ammo scrapper?
---
I'll be honest, the mire is the last place I'd live, but I'd be lying if I wasn't impressed people are coming on in to settle in Appalachia. Though the more settlers I see, the more bloodeagle spots I see. I've seen at least 4 extras since I started searching.
---
No Halloween event? Seriously?! I’ve been holding off on trading for Halloween outfits to get them through the event instead 😑😤
---
He hasn't worked in decades. Just a layabout now.
---
I had just started a bloodied commando build just before the update.  I got a taste of that high damage and was like wow.  Now I feel like I am running my junkie's commando build that I am benching for a while.  Good damage out put but not like before the patch.  All in all I really have had no issues.  I can still kill SBs and all the high level stuff pretty quickly.  But I am still getting use to this low health thing.
---
Bombs Drop Event will happen during the halloween
---
Isnt it? So fun
---
Bet you're in for a shock but lmk if the difference is really that huge
---
As mentioned above, this would rapidly turn into a explosive gun orgy.  Perhaps remove the XP from each kill?  Any rewards would only be earned at completion, so no worries about an event-mate killing everything before you could tag, etc.
---
I think I'd remove the ash/goo pile animations (though something tells me the devs might break the rest of the game trying to implement), and increase the enemy's move speed every wave. So, you could use your explosive GP without having the ash pile lag, but you'd risk having enemies in your face nearly constantly by wave 3.
---
This is so unbelievably wrong.
---
Pretty much. I pulled nothing yesterday then got the Super Reactor today, so hopefully tomorrow has better luck for you as it did for me.
---
Brah, ill be on around 4pm CT and i can build one for ya, if you still need it.
---
 Lmk.
---
Is it a true halloween event and sure it isnt happening over 31st
---
I have no idea. I’ve certainly not confirmed the current existence of the bug. I just know that the collectron has an independent container like any other resource collector.
---
Harper ferry robot is at the train station now I hear.
---
Will do
---
Yes!
---
just say it's you, SH.
---
No, Legendary Perks are still top. Revealed after just 100 days of the game being live, and released after more than a full year of delays (They were supposed to come in midsummer 2019).
---
By comparison, Loadouts might not have been delayed at all (this time) as Season three lasts well into February, and it will have a second big patch in the middle.
---
Make it your next 5 perks (max it). That also means you will be adding to your INT. Which gives you more XP from each kill.  Join ‘casual’ public teams also for more INT boost
---
Considering it’s been a mod for a long long time, I have to agree. How hard can it be?? I can’t even looked at their time lines anymore. Too frustrating.
---
I’m a fully optimised and geared up player. I even have legacies and all that jazz. Tell you what though, all these changes hitting at once made me feel like I was trapped in International Women’s Day...
---
Yeah I've only got to do it twice, first time was a faster swing speed mole miner gauntlet and the second was a faster swing speed bear arm so I forgave him too but it makes me sad that he never works.
---
Can also still one shot with my inst gauss rifle. But why should I use it when I want to use my quad 90rw .05 explosive sniper. Less choices, less play stiles, less RP opportunities is not a good thing. More grind is not a good thing.
---
Fretting intensifies!
---
Expeditions also delayed and broken steel moved also it looks like
---
Hahaha. Oh. 
---
Shit.
---
I’m experiencing this with PvP. It’s bullshit.
---
I think the RNG for enemies and mutations is broken. This is the third time the system chooses Resilient robots, and yesterday it had to be changed manually...
---
Omg yes, I love Biv.
---
This is the area for my build: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZU-zP2710](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZU-zP2710)
---
I had to do this too, now it's way easier.  You'll make it.
---
Well among us has fortnite like micro-transactions. Your pets and stuff
---
Yeah armor and weapons break pretty fast now. Another addition Bethesda made to make the game as miserable as possible
---
Yeah I'm just using him for looks right now, hopefully they'll end up fixing him sometime but it took a while last time so I'm not sure about it.
---
Well.. i mean you kinda can respec on the fly. Every level after 50, you can move special points around. 
---
BUT I understand the desire to wipe the slate clean and start over without creating a new character.
---
The only thing i dont agree with is the square build area, but im not gonna flip any tables if it was changed to square, other then that good list
---
We know nothing about that event yet, and will be available from 22nd to 26th from what I see.
---
Shotguns needed a buff anyways
---
Doing Moe proud.
---
Yeah, after I did resilient robots and a new guy joined the Daily Ops team, it changed to Freezing Super Mutants.
---
Months later still borked 🤷‍♂️
---
It does
---
u/LadyDevann, u/Valseek , think theres another bug to report here.
---
Sneak is a core mechinic, hopefully its addressed
---
 If you manage to find any of the items Ward wants that aren't marked as quest items, you can still compete the quest easily every day.  Go talk to Ward with the item in your inventory. The quest will update and tell you to return the stolen item.  Then I just drop it on the floor and talk to Ward again to complete the quest, then pick it back up. This also occasionally allows me to complete the quest more than once per day. I've found the Multiscope just lying on the ground at Grafton dam near the rusty car, many times. Easily to accidentally scrap, though. If you can find the Osmosis Kit, it's safer since it's a Misc item.
---
Yeah that's not halloween is it
---
Ah, true. But the other one has many free games and no transactions
---
Figured my character strained herself the first time she used it and just doesn't want to anymore.   Like most exercise equipment in people's homes.
---
I'm not so sure. Few will leave if enemy health bloat is reduced or level scaling is made less aggressive pre-50/removed in the Forest. However, 'casuals' likely spend a lot of money in the Atomic Shop that would be lost if they end up losing interest in the game, and new players being turned off early on directly hit Bethesda in the bottom line. In this case I think something will have to be done to 'soften the blow' so to speak. It won't be a rollback or anything, but something.
---
You’re not wrong. I hate scorchbeast on my melee cause they never seem to land. And some events that are easier if you don’t have to run all over the place get annoying and I generally won’t start them solo.
---
I think it's less about trouble killing and more about not being able to farm low level legendaries and junk for whatever reason
---
im glad im not the only one... kinda
---
It's not that significant. It helps but essentially in PA you don't really need it
---
Well it’s not helping that people are coming on here just asking for huge changes to be made rather than asking what they could do to try to improve things.  It doesn’t help when people come in here with hyperbole stories of enemies taking thousands of shots to kill, even 20 would be pushing it unless you really were using the worst possible options.  
---
I’m not good, and that’s where I’m seeing the problem.  I could see if I was sitting here with a B2525 fixer while wearing magic armor and I used to kill the SBQ queen in 5 seconds.  I’m coming from the standpoint of someone who has gone to scorched earth and at times walked away with nothing since I couldn’t even get the 1000 points of damage in to unlock it dropping any legendary.  I’m coming from the standpoint of someone who can’t legitimately clear a silo to drop a nuke solo.  This is coming from the he standpoint of someone who practically had to beg for Fixer Plans because I could never get Encrypted done.  
---
I’m not good. I took nearly a year off from this game, I’m still trying to catch up and get to max faction for some of the rewards.  I only have a level 200 because I found that stacking a bunch of ghoul slayer gear, regardless of the level it was, was great for making it super survivable at fort defiance and farmed the hell out of that place during a 2x XP weekend.
---
They even delayed it for months yet still didn't do what was simple and most clearly best from the outset. Same issue with the ammo converter camp item - clearly we should be using the same currency menu system as the caps, scrip, and treasury notes yet somehow they decided on a terminal and then, using the sunk cost fallacy, continued to use the terminal for their update fix.
---
A sprint into a melee attack acts as a power attack too with no windup
---
I guess so. I thought it will be happening from the 26th to 31st but it seems like I saw it wrong the first time
---
.
---
i just grabbed a Tesla from a player vendor, what are the best mods to use on it?
---
aww, that'S too bad :(
---
Ball gag now avail in the atom shop for 1200 atom

That happened to me once, for about 15 minutes. Then it stopped. Hasn't happened again.
---
Wish he woulda showcased the Green House stuff,but all &amp; all not a bad little video.
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
I mean, I run a J5015 hunting rifle and two-shot weakpoints on any enemy other than bosses. Two belly shots on a Deathclaw, one to two headshots on a supermutant, one headshot on any smaller humanoid, one eyeshot on a Gutsy. It’s not a bad gun. Stronger before One Wasteland but I’m still putting everything down easily
---
I'm having an issue where I cant beat ACP. With a full server of people ranging from level 100-400 we still keep failing.  This last try I put almost 7,000 rounds from my explosive minigun into him and we barely got him down to half health before the time ran out.  Having 2 people with that explosive mini gun, another with a laser mini gun and an ultrasite minigun. We should be able to take him down. Before the update I never had issues with it.  
---
As for the update I fucking love it.  The game is actually hard again. Forcing events to be run with multiple people makes the game feel new again.
---
Make double score for weekly and it would be worth it. Otherwise, the double exp is much more valuable
---
Agreed! Competitive players may enjoy spending hours online researching killer builds, but I’m a casual, too, and would much rather be playing a game and experimenting with things than reading about the best way to build. If only certain builds are viable, why not just let us select from a handful of premade characters? If we go into a game thinking we can experiment and have fun, and then the game changes so that’s less possible, it’s certainly not the *player’s* fault, and we shouldn’t have to put in all the work to “fix” our characters that the system has broken.
---
Shotgun builds are practically ruined but I heard the magic shotties still work
---
50 dr while aiming*
---
Played since FO1. Talk about hard and unforgiving. This game does seem like it's going back to basics with it's difficulty. Now it seems like you have to use aid items and I don't get why that's a bad thing.
---
Not sure why I'd need to farm low level legendaries. But I welcome the changes they made and have had 0 problems with it. Just weeding out the people who don't have the resolve to overcome problems. See yaaaa
---
I’m happy with the rest of the patch, though, and the spongy enemies aren’t detracting too much (except that Assaultron at the end of the Uplink mission on the first day—it was SO MUCH HARDER to beat than the Blood Eagle boss).
---
Chill out.
---
We don’t know personally I think it’s going to allow people to launch multiple nukes from one silo
---
Did you try hoping servers?
---
I wanted to get Legendary Luck and Take One for the Team to max rank but ran out of perk coins while I was doing Luck. Then I realized I should've done Take One for the Team first.
---
Oh, yes! Very useful when you turn around and see a glowing super mutant behemoth charging at you lol.
---
Joking aside, I've had days in a row where I couldn't get sophia to give me a quest and found out that I already had the quest, it just never went active on the map.
---
Double check that it's not inactive in your pip boy.
---
It really should at least show an inactive icon on the map in such situations.
---
Stealth comando is still alive not like before, but still viable (i guess, from what people are saying)
---
Isn't the entire point of Fallout 76 to "reclaim" the wasteland? Isn't that the entire story arc, to turn this savage hostile land into a manageable home?
---
And if you're really going to bring "realism" into it, then if I kill molerats for days on end, shouldn't I get better at it. **Experienced**, at it, one could say? And gaining this **experience**, would help me kill them more effectively. They're dumb mutated animals, they wouldn't also learn with me, especially if I keep killing them.
---
Wow your build must be shit, what lvl are you
---
There's electric absorption for assaultrons now.
---
According to Fandom there are 4 changed locations in One Wasteland [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/One\_Wasteland\_For\_All#Locations](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/One_Wasteland_For_All#Locations)
---
Didn't realise you had to complete the vault quest first!! All the advise said get max reputation before completing it to take advantage of both sets of perks!! Will select the raiders and get it done now. Thanks for the feedback.
---
That's not too bad, you can still fetch some good power out of luck ^^. You're better off than the poor sould that invested in retribution or charisma
---
I was waiting on this comment. "Get 'em out, boys" becoming this sub's "Undertaker threw Mankind off the Hell in a Cell" comment.
---
I want weasel lol.
---
Im mid level 40 and every single monster i could take on before is now ganging up and killing me each time :l sucks, I couldnt even pick some tomatoes for the grill event cause of 3 scorpions insta killing me
---
Can I see your build m8?
---
I’m basically a vats commando build. I run with some vanguard, chameleon and an auto stim armor. Junkie explosive and vampire faster fire rate handmades for out in the open and dungeons. Perked heavy in agility for adrenaline, action girl, etc.
---
Nice, don't tell Bethesda but I would have given 3000 atoms for it
---
Yes, there is a double SCORE week on the schedule.
---
Yep, picked up 20 legendaries yesterday. way faster than trolling the wasteland, AND, i get more ammo than i use...stared with 500 Fuel, after yesterday, I have 5k. cant beat it.
---
Also, got a b2525 plasma rifle...not bad.
---
I can later, the link I thought I had was terribly outdated when I originally was going to make my commando a power armor character, and I don’t have links to the other builds.  
---
But we should always keep in mind, this game was never intended to be like other fallout games.  I mean there were no NPCs to start, it was supposed to be us being the stories with each other.  We were supposed to bring the conflict to the world with PVP and slap damage.  While we were told we could travel alone, it was intended for us to group up.  Yes changes have been made but this was never intended to be fallout 5, their development of the game may in the end not provide exactly what you want.  Just like the changes in World of Warcraft stopped being what I wanted and I eventually left that game.
---
Be mad all you'd like, it's the truth. Your salt doesn't validate you.
---
 They sent him to the coolah
---
What level are you? Where are you in the game?
---
That’s my guess, as well.  This sub was nonstop complaining about disconnects and lag during the entire event.
---
Oh, and carry weight, damage, defense, jump height, specials and a billion other things.  Public teams are great.
---
Perk Loadouts are the prestige system of this year's roadmap.
---
Also, modders get it done with a month after launch. 2 years later &amp; the actual game developers still can't get it done.
---
Did not realize that counted as a power attack, thank you.
---
How would that work though? If you set yourself to be level 5 can you still equip perk cards and use higher level weapons and armour? It seems like a really pointless idea when you can just help your low level friends anyway regardless of level.
---
I installed emergency protocols on my new T-65 and was wondering if it worked. I turtle tested it at West Tek and went to 0 health but didn't die? I was waiting to see if it triggered a stimpack and it didn't. So there might be an issue...
---
edit: I would have tested it more but was so fkn pissed at this nerf I logged off lol.
---
Now disclaimer, I haven't tried events, but my 71 stealth sniper is doing good with his 1* instigating gauss rifle. 100% one-shots super mutants of the same level (~70-75) with headshots.
---
Perks are all the standard: Rifleman x9, Tank Killer 3x, Bloody Mess 3x, Covert 3x.
---
My vanilla, non-legendary combat rifle takes like 4-5 stealth headshots to down a super mutant now though - I really do need a better one.
---
I can see how events with swarming enemies will be a nightmare though, since the gauss has such a low fire rate, and without stealth my combat rifle does basically nothing.
---
I was doing that yesterday just to make sure that I wasn't going crazy but at least with me, it seems like the quest is just non existent. Usually when you scrap his chair it'll say that the quest is failed but when I did that, nothing popped up.
---
Either way the game should be doable with the normal enemies without even having to spec a single damage improving perk.  It would be understandable to have to have damage perks for fighting legendaries if you don't want it to take a super long time and use a lot of resources.  But normal enemies should be able to be handled without a lot of trouble even if you don't take any damage perks.  Now I'm not saying absolutely 0 weapon modification perks at all, obviously we have perks for armor piercing and crippling and such.  And perks for keeping your armor and weapons from falling apart just looking at them.  But as it is right now, you kind of need all of the above at the same time for things to be workable.
---
I'm not trying to say that you should be able to straight steamroll every enemy in the game with no perks dedicated to causing more damage and destruction, but it should be playable and not be a CHORE just to kill normal enemies or weaker legendary enemies.  Mole rats and crickets should not be the bane of the wasteland and cause me more fear than super mutants with missile launchers!  And if I am speced for massive damage, then I should be able to mostly steamroll through normal enemies, even after the rework.
---
I realize it's tough to make the game a challenge for people who have every damage increasing perk while still leaving it possible for people who play a more utility based character to be able to even function against enemies.  It's why the way it was before was a little better in that regard as you could stay in easier areas if you were not built for damage.  Now, it's really not like that.  In my opinion, what should have been done instead of buffing every enemy, would be for the power level of characters higher level than the area to be brought down to the level of the area instead, like how Guild Wars 2 did things.  Or increasing the strength and damage resistance of said enemies in proportion to how much higher level you are than the area.  That way low level characters and utility characters could still have their areas and have to move into higher level areas as they progress, and super high level characters can go to low level areas to help their low level friends and do events, and still have a challenge without it breaking the balance as much as it has right now. 
---
I understand this is only the start and there will be growing pains and I acknowledge that Bethesda may have plans in the works to make things better than they currently are.  For what it's worth, I'm kind of half damage, half utility, and I'm not really having too much more trouble than before.  I am having to use more ammo for sure to do the same things, though thankfully my gatling gun isn't too hungry, but it's a noticeable difference.  But I most definitely am pretty heavily speced into heavy weapons to make them not feel like pea shooters, even if I'm not 100% damage oriented.  But, if I wanted to dick around with a weapon I'm not speced in, I used to be able to do it without getting my ass handed to me or blowing all my ammo, and it's a lot more difficult now.
---
I know it's probably not easily possible for Bethesda, or maybe it is, but I think it would be cool if you could pick between how it is now and how it used to be when picking a server.  At least for now.  That way newer characters and characters not built for heavy damage can have a way to not feel like they are being slapped around so badly until things get better adjusted, and the people liking the changes can have their fun as well.
---
Rogue AI firing nukes indiscriminately around the map? 
---
Maybe special mobs or events when nukes are dropped anywhere?
---
Go ask the mr handy in front of vault 76 where the overseer is. Should kick start the quest
---
I think it’s a good point right now, it’s the right balance between risk and reward, in my opinion.  The rewards you would get were too high for too little risk before.
---
No Halloween event is a huge bummer.
---
I agree. I've also wanted at least 5 presets for the perk cards... does anyone else agree?
---
In fact the camp budget got a nerd in patch 22 (stealth, it wasn't in the notes). I got the military trunk from the season rewards, which is a stash box. In order to get it placed I had to scrap a stash, plus the table it was stood on, a sofa, 2 lights and a plant because my budget had been exceeded. Something is taking more budget now than it was before.
---
I play on Xbox and everything’s been fine for me
---
Yes, it is 👍🏻
---
Same experience here. Liberators should never be high level. As with Mr Gutsy, they were tough before and are even tougher now - why did Bethesda think that I would enjoy having my character die more?
---
My Bloodied L45 lever action used to do 1000-1200 dmg stealth headshots and now it's only getting 100-300 dmg if I'm lucky.
---
Been like this for a long time but then seemed to not happen that much. But going to fort defiance some ghouls will die after I look at them in vats then they fall over
---
Ouch sorry to hear
---
Go for it though I’ve never used dms on here
---
Some seen to call it a "casual build", others a "general build"; for me it has always been about versatility. I find such being more inline with the lore and tradition of Fallout. If I'm a wandering survivor Ineed to adapt to what's available and what challenges I may face in an ever changing landscape. To create a specific and detailed "build" takes away flexibility and to change the game at its core to force this behavior is very limiting. The perks, which used to be a way to spice things up and create individuality have now, especially with the "legendary" attributes, have become the focus and a game within itself. A puzzle where you have to find the exact combination of pieces to have success in the game. 
---
There is no reason that any combination of weapons, armor and perks, scaled to your level, is not successful for game play without added stress. After years of playing Fallout with great pleasure, I am finding One Wasteland is achieving the opposite of given intent. I am finding that flexibility and individuality are no longer favorable.
---
Sorry for any typos, don't have my glasses on.
---
This is GENIUS!
---
Hi Becky I’m dad
---
I’m just talking about being versatile in general. I change them up for silo runs, certain events and pvp. My go-to survival build is a 3 weapon pvp build honestly and it fucking slays, but yeah melee is not hard at all with the right cards and mutations lol
---
Why don't you drop one???
---
I swapped out some of my cards and added a maxed Demolition Expert. This has helped me out tremendously for my explosive damage from my BE lever and non-auto BE handmade.
---
Good to know!
---
You can group with them now. If you are level 50, and they are level 5, the enemy will be level 5 to them and 50 to you.  They will get legendaries.  Unless you’re talking about twinking them, in which case why not just give them your high level legendary items you don’t want, and they can scrip and then get gear from the purveyor?
---
It has similar damage at least and is better than a normal attack
---
Couldn't do Uranium Fever last night without my Fixer breaking on me. Died many times. Pretty damn lame. It isn't doing much damage at all, and it's L45 Bloody Exploding too.
---
No, not in the slightest. Also, would you like slots to be per character?
---
And that's how it should be tuned. 👌
---
Bloodied explosive not just ffr.
---
I don’t see why that is necessary. Play with your low level friends. They will are the enemy as their level and you see it as high level. You both would get level appropriate gear for the kill...
---
That’s the whole point of one wasteland.
---
This would be awesome. Either that the Wise Mothman let's you.
---
You do get better at it. It doesnt take me more than a few shots to kill them, at most. If you are actually managing your build and working on it, they die with ease and will never be a challenge. That goes for many of these mobs, but especially mole rats and other pests. They aren't a challenge. Even with the scaling. And yeah, thats the selling point they used that you never actually achieve. You build a tiny little camp in a small area and can claim workshops that are never permanent in certain small areas. The enemies will always come back, and you never actually reclaim anything. Sorry to break that to you.
---
All the new rewards, those being outfit/mask and plans (rare/uncommon) are once a day chance per rank.
---
I try and play as a raider so I have the raider gas mask and the elite NCR ranger uniform since the colors match nicely
---
I am level 17. I found her first couple of tapes. I’m not worried about directional markers, I know those disappear. There’s just nothing at all in the main quest section
---
Yh problem ie I need friends for that
---
Oh well that's no exactly exciting tbh. But guess we'll have to see
---
If you want more camp traffic move near crater, foundation, or near white spring/savage divide area. Also don't sell stuff at price because no one will buy it
---
I think thats what the One Wastland update Is supposed to do - For example, in the forest, what your low level friends see as a L1-6 enemy, you see as a L50.
---
Whats performed behind the scenes to determine when the critter is killed, IDK.
---
until your 80% elder's chance for rare and you get nothing. :( https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/634888960354680841/756203750728925254/unknown.png
---
Every day is different. Day one definitely had signs with arrows on them on the map. Day two was a much less confusing map. Either way, just stay on the booster and book it to the next objective, which does have an indicator.
---
I could’ve sworn I did but I’ll try again.
---
Makes no sense
---
You can also try going to the overseer's house and talking to her.
---
I won’t be on until a bit later,hopefully 5’ish eastern time.
---
If ya still need it,I may have an extra plan on the good ol mule.
---
Yes the freezing was a fun "gah, get away from me you..." gimmick. But I'm glad it wasn't my hand to hand character.
---
My favorite so far are the exploders.
---
It says daily ops.
---
I think what the OP wants to do is get the level 5 legendary and give it to their friend to use.
---
Yeah, they haven't thought this though I'm afraid. Hope they make some adjustments for some of the events.
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
It's disgustingly absurd that console players have to go through that stupid menu and manually swap in and out all of these cards. Simple tasks like getting ready at your camp before a nuke become incredibly painful. 
---
Let's say you're doing an event, then want to sell some weapons you looted at a station, then go to your camp to repair weapons/make ammo/etc and then go to a nuke zone. The amount of perk swapping is absurd (the perk card system is stupid, btw, and even loadouts are just a bandaid, not a cure). Now imagine you want to get into PA - gotta swap in/out several perks again and you might be in combat. It really makes you miss Fallout 4 where all the perks were static - you either had them or you didnt unlock them yet. No constant menu hopping - perk cards are like a second inventory to manage.
---
Considering they mentioned their resources going to Steel Dawn I doubt it will be a very complicated event
---
Putting one of the bashing damage stocks on it ups the durability a good bit. The forceful stock I think?
---
I put it on all my weapons now for that extra boost in durability.
---
Edit - works with the grips too, for pistols.
---
I use 45 mostly and I recently did my first prime before patch to my non explosive bloodied gat. I thought ammosmith and super duper gave me a lot. Shit not changing plasma cores over with my maxed legendary perk gives me 9 without super duper. I had 10 plasma cores after changing them I had 50. 45 I get 53 and 556 I use more now being I use my anti armor faster fire handmade and I get 90 each one. I love it and I love ammo. Ppl say they hate update because they use more ammo. Shit I make so much ammo now I’ll never run out
---
7.5%/10.5%/13.5%
---
100% fill, no crit fill on crit 
---
Only good if you have 1 Luck. Just run critical savvy.
---
I wish I could do the ops 🤣 back to disconnecting every 5 minutes.
---
I was just testing my crit build and unsurprisingly the new additive changes affect special bonuses as well.
---
used to be FLC was useless in a crit build because with critical savvy + unyielding you were getting crits every two shots or even every other shot. it refills the bar completely but at that point you were getting enough crits anyway.
---
but now I'm not so sure. the only way I was getting a 1:1 cycle was with crit savvy 3, unyielding and a 15% vats refill weapon.
---
That would make the grind even smaller though which Bethesda will obviously never do.
---
I made a post about this trying to explain that pushing your dmg to insane levels is in no way a viable way to play the game, at most after 2mins when Revenant fizzles out the numbers are gone.
---
It's just fun experimentation within the legit limit of the ruleset, I'm not going to ruin anyone elses fun
---
Shhhh! Don’t give them ideas! The more money they make of 76 the less they’re likely to release fallout 5!
---
Point taken.  Gonna need more ammo and a bigger gun :-).  It was definitely more of a challenge than it used to be.  After day 2 I'm enjoying the game as much as I did before.  I'm a melee build so events that require lots of ammo will change my collection and scrapping vs selling habits.
---
I'll be honest, I was getting really bored with this game. I'd log in to do dailys, get the SCORE, some gold, some scrip, then just log off. I never group up unless I need to for a quest or daily. I could solo most events, there as no challenge, I rarely ever died, it was just... tedious. 
---
Now, I've got to pay attention and work. This is the most fun I've had with the game since wastelanders first came out. I don't think it fundamentally changed the game, it just made it interesting again. One shotting a few dozen scorched was a task, like doing the dishes or vacuuming. now its a battle. I find that more enjoyable. But, to each their own.
---
No, they don't have to pick a side, and the reality is that picking a side is going to be bad for the game in the long term.
---
Making a game that appeals to a wider variety of players is certainly harder and more work, but they're a big company with lots of resources, they should be able to figure it out. 
---
I totally believe what a lot of the long-term players are saying about how the game was too easy for them at this point and how they wanted more challenge, and it's great that this update is fixing some of those issues for them. 
---
But as a new and casual player who spent some time playing the update yesterday, I can unequivocally say that the game post One Wasteland was both much harder and much less fun for me than it was before the update. So much so that I logged off and tracked down this subreddit to see if there was some sort of issue/bug with the patch that was making things so bad for me. 
---
I've got a couple hundred hours in FO4, and until the update 76 felt a lot like 4 except with some interesting online options. Roam around, explore, collect stuff, occasionally shoot things. Good times. 
---
But the time I spent playing after the update felt like a very different game, basically a grindy shooter where trying to do anything else was a big hassle. 
---
Is that really all they want this game to be? It doesn't have to be just one thing. It wasn't one thing before a couple days ago. 
---
Really the biggest issue is that a bunch of people have been playing long enough that they've gone through all of the content in the game. The solution to that should be to add more end-game content, and not just rework the numbers to make the game harder for everyone. 
---
From the point of view of a new, low-level, casual player, all this update has done is make everything I want to do in the game take longer and be more tedious.
---
My weapons break straight away. I've been repairing them daily, sometimes two ot three times, and I've had to repair armour for what feels like the first time in six months..
---
These ops would be a ridiculous boring slog if stealth were allowed. 
---
Not a single enemy would end up engaged until the boss room. 
---
The timer would likely run out on the rewards well before you even get there with how massive stages are.
---
Locking out stealth ensures that every one is on the same page with the events intended mad dash to the finish line.
---
I play a bloodied melee stealth build too and had no issue swapping a couple perks to adjust to the situation. 
---
It's why perks are swappable at all. So we can adjust to changing situations.
---
As a fellow tank main, I agree 100%
---
Games such as world of warcraft have had what is known as “heirloom gear” where it had a max level of stats and you could wear it and grow into it.  Honestly I would have liked more things like the Mistress of Mysteries garb where you can upgrade it as you level up, I had wished they had done more with that.  
---
That said, keep in mind any change would take weeks of development, then testing. While it could be a welcome change, you’d probably level up to that gear before the update even came out.
---
While the Halloween event isn’t on the calendar, who cares? We have a new community event in October. Why do we need to have the same thing we had last year?
---
From the colossal problem event
---
Why is it rare and why are fixers all of a sudden just called the fixer and then have there legendary stats i got one prolly aint worth crap believe its a troubleshooters ffr 1 agility
---
I can imagine how fast my weapons would have broken without max Gunsmith. Like I shudder at the thought.
---
So now you're doing sensible levels of damage, what's not to like?
---
Love that the UI for it feels more “videogamey”.
---
I prefer struggle over leasure, that's why when I did a bloody build, I kept my character weak but high damage. This new change is great, because I can now experience struggle again but with better gear
---
Tree tops, Hawkes Refuge, Watoga tower, Lewis and Son, and Mole Miner camp south of the Palace
---
Oh SH\* it's level 10, we can't win.
---
\*all NPCs proceed to take the easy way out\*
---
Yea would be interesting to know if all the bonus Explo Perks are effected by them. Would be a nice combo and a really good extra dmg output for melee builds now.
---
Hell yes, I'm all about looking good.
---
My outfit features the Urban Scout Armor Mask (OG one), Grillmasters Hat, and the Hunters Long Coat. I love the way these look combined.
---
Only one thing to do. Get better. Take chems change ur perk cards around find some buddies. You will be alright
---
Glad I could help. 🤓
---
Probably trying to stealth the event.
---
Don’t forget they added skins to the fixer!
---
I miss it too, now I feel under pressure to do everything to make sure I don't fall behind when I thought this season was supposed to be better designed to NOT put pressure on people who couldn't play every day.
---
I agree with you buddy
---
That was the other way I was thinking of taking it, and I just think it seems like a lot of work and coding so people can twink out their friends characters.
---
I wholesale agree eith this even if I did buy some for when I'm someone sets me up in glassed cavern.
---
It's an award from a colossal problem event. Player vendors may have them for sale, I do.
---
I did that a couple times, definitely looks sick.
---
I personally don't see a problem with it but I guess I'm in the Minority when it comes to that.
---
&gt;When I wanted a challenge there were plenty of fairly high level places to scratch that itch.
---
There really, really was not.
---
Man I soloed the Resilant Robot one as my first time doing it and it was brutal. I run a bloodied build and I died at least 30 times but made it through in 25 minutes. Stupid gutsies destroy my health with whatever ballistic weapon they use. Ill have to find a team next time
---
&gt;After further discussion, we’ve decided that we would like the Brotherhood’s return to Appalachia to be a larger moment for the game.
---
I'm calling bullshit on this one. This is you not being able to stick a deadline &amp; the corporation overall being too cheap to shell out money to properly resource it.
---
This better blow Wastelanders out of the water, give how that was delayed too.
---
Looks like we have another dead zone period coming like the back end of last year.
---
Same here..kinda upsetting 😅
---
Limb dmg is a magic effect. Yes it is bugged.
---
Thirty six rounds of 10mm to kill a level 14 glowing radrat for a level 14 character makes the game "extremely difficult" and a lot more difficult IMO for low levels because they can't go back to the forest and tackle level 1s and 6s anymore.
---
What system
---
I feel like this was kind of necessary. The game was so easy from so many angles 😬
---
For 3k you get the whole gimp suit.
---
No you don't like the music, or no you don't want more radio stations?  Or no to both?
---
In addition to this, it should also be noted that 1) It just came out on console (no PTS), 2) Beth has said that with this weapon damage change they will be able to make adjustments going forward, and 3) there is no reason to think that Beth will not continue to evaluate and adjust. The question is whether overall this is good for the long term health of the game or not, and I believe it definitely is good from that perspective.
---
I agree and gave you an upvote, but just want to point out that really are some quality single player games (or couch co-op) being produced by indie studios. I’m a huge fan of Ska Studios, particularly for “Charlie Murder”, which is more Diablo-style action-looter than anything else. And some big games are mostly MT-less. Elder Scrolls Online, while it has a ton of after-purchase paid content, still has literally hundreds of hours of content for solo play that’s included in the base cost. Same goes for Borderlands 3 and Path of Exile, too. I still have hope. But definitely, companies can make money hand-over-fist from MTs as long as people are willing to pay for them. And one country or another will always be wealthy enough for people to throw their real-life money for in-game powerups. I feel like we need to have some sort of “intervention” for the whales that keep MT games alive, so they’ll understand they could be throwing their money into a cure for cancer and feeding the poor instead of buying repair kits!
---
The people complaining about One Wasteland and the people who wanted the game harder are not necessarily the same people
---
May be a bit of overlap there, but I'd guess not much
---
Are you following a guide? If so, it’s probably outdated. 
---
She has two different sets of tapes, and they have different purposes. Have you already done the stuff for the wayward?
---
I like the explosixe enemies better but you have to keep your distance from them. I have dense SS chest armor and fireproof 2* but still received damage from them. Or maybe I was just too close with my Gauss shotgun.😁
---
I like them now didn’t care for the first days op but I was on my bloodied commando switched to my PA heavy an they been smooth ever since.
---
Now if we could just get everybody to stay around the uplink so we can get sub 8 min times that would be great lol
---
I believe there's another treasure event coming but for Halloween this year. If you have pails left over from the first one, you can open them now. You get things like an Animatronic Clown, bed of nails, Safari gorilla backpack and more.
---
Damn, didn’t realize this. That was a fun one. Probably too busy cranking out season rewards that they had nothing left for Halloween.
---
I must have super crappy orangey luck then.
---
Took a long brake before the event startet last year. I was really looking forward to trying it this year.
---
Ah well, too bad i guess
---
I have managed to do it solo twice and in a team twice since the update 🤷‍♂️
---
Get that shotgun perk that criples limbs, and start shooting legs of ghouls and monsters, and shoot the arms of super mutants to criple.
---
This is the only way ive found to take down the crazy tanky enemies now after this weeks update
---
Why didn't we just get eso with guns and less people?
---
* what exactly are you trying to do?  Are you level 91 trying to solo the daily ops?  
---
* What perks do you have equipped? What mutations do you have?  
---
* What weapon are you using?  What mods does it have? 
---
* How are you approaching the combat?  Are you running into a middle of enemies?  Are you using grenades to soften them up first? 
---
* Are you using chems, food, drink, etc. to buff up your stats and damage
---
We can’t help if we can’t try to find out where the problem is stemming from
---
More radio stations would be nice. But the music from the atom shop is dreadfully awful
---
It seems a decent way to get damage as the damage perks are now useless (testing a level 100 super mutant, a max level Iron Fist netted me 10 addition damage on a 333 hit).
---
You have to couple it with a max level Demolitions Expert, that’s five whole perk points. 
---
I won’t be able to test it until next week, but I would love to hear feedback about Grenadier. 
---
I also think this perk should be paired with Collateral Damage. It’s underpowered but if you’re boosting your explosive damage, you might as well... might not be worth upgrading though. Too soon to tell.
---
did you delete the other one because I pointed out it's probably you behind that handle, SH?
---
To be honest thats kinda the point of fallout, scavanging and rebuilding between battles.  ive spent probably 3/4 of my 60 ish hours with the game just scanvegening and scraping and inventory management.
---
pc, why?
---
Bloodied melee could certainly benefit from more agility and endurance. But take a second look at taking one for the team. If like a lot of us you’re always on a team these  days it’s a lot of extra damage if enemies are already attacking you- like say they will be on Daily Ops.
---
I'm a Bloodied crippling-shotgun and pistol build and a few cards makes me an efficient melee build. Granted bloodied is easy but still. Previously I was a rifleman and I still made melee work in my favor.
---
Can confirm Demo Expert boosts it
---
Idk man. Only differences I'm seeing now are my character can't complete it without dying multiple times, my bloody exploding fixer breaks before it's over, and the mole miners are harder to kill. Wish the patch was rolled back tbh.
---
Howd you farm so much lead?
---
is it rare? i've only played it twice so far.
---
12 weeks for a standard development life cycle means 12-24 levels...
---
And edit:  and nothing from Bethesda has been standard, it would likely be more than 12 weeks.
---
Unfortunately I think this sub is corrupted with people who make stuff up to bash Bethesda. Not saying that this person is lying. My point is that this sub’s credibility is suspect on this whole issue.
---
Does the damage bug still exist with the tesla rifle? Cause they said they patched it, but I can't trust their patch notes at all. Especially since they said they also fixed the damage bug with flamers and that damage bug still exists. Also there's a damage bug with gatling plasma flamers, and I don't know if plasma gun flamers also get the damage bug, but it would be good to know if they do since flamer weapons are pretty decent with this patch.
---
It's not condescending to tell people they need to adjust. Literally every online game has updates and requires adjustments. Bethesda had to do something to make this game worth playing and they did.
---
If you wanted to say something condescending you could have said something like: 
---
"Oddly enough Bethesda decided that having a game more suited to post apocalyptic survival was more compelling than a flower picking simulator"
---
or
---
"Perhaps a petition could be started with Bethesda to buy and bring back Club Penguin with Fallout skins,"
---
But stating the obvious that after a major update to an online game that some of the players might have to adjust their play style is definitely not condescending.
---
is it a rare reward? how much do you typically see them selling for?
---
Thanks.  I have other stuff to play though,  so no big deal. Since I first found out about OW, I've been getting back into eve online. I also have a bunch of single player games to catch up on.
---
no but ive had 2 crash to desktops in the 2 days since the update where as i think i've only ever had 1 before
---
Ouch, that's cold.
---
Don't worry. I've built a Haunted house for everyone to enjoy so if you see savethezombies on your map, come in for a scare.
---
At least it's not removing buffs, mutations, and legendaries by mistake. :p
---
Which is actually surprising to me. Or maybe just not enough people have one yet to have had it occur.
---
Wonder of you could merge it with a bunch of plushies or some other interesting item inside.
---
I have the same build and yeah it's harder but it's not that bad.
---
Complete events, take workshops
---
i would if i didnt get laser gatling blasted by every npc and die all the time
---
They wanted people to be able to be more flexible with builds, so I sort of get what they were trying to do with the legendary perks for SPECIALs.
---
But getting perk points through scrapping unused perk cards kind of defeats that, because you won't have perk cards readily available if you changed specials.
---
I think to get that flexibility they wanted, they should remove the legendary perk SPECIAL cards and move them to a different system. Maybe something like you can can any 2 or 3 of the legendary SPECIALs equip, and require the perk coins to swap them in and out.
---
This way, people who want to swap builds would likely have more rounded stats and use the legendary SPECIAL to cap those stats.
---
Completed it last night with no issues
---
Oh no, makes perfect sense to me - modders &gt; Bethesda devs.
---
Sometimes I wonder if the people that religiously hate on this game and Bethesda have only played fallout 4. Having played morrowind, oblivion, skyrim, and all 4 console fallout games I gotta say skyrim is waayyyy more buggy than 76 in my experience
---
Some much what OP says. With a four man team, all next to the boosters, you should have no trouble completing under 7 minutes.
---
Isn't it normally "is it plugged in" first?
---
It's on the roadmap. Look at the last section "Winter" it's in the same spot it was.
---
thank you 
---
What so no chance of getting the outfits and plans from last year 😭
---
Plus player vendors will have loads for sale going forward too
---
Commando weapons are also all recycled from Fallout 4 (not counting the fixer because it’s just a re-skin)
---
I would love to have something new to use in this game. All of the other weapon classes got new weapons since launch but rifle users have been neglected.
---
Thx. Right now I run a 2:1 cycle. If I had a 15% vats refill weapon it would be 1:1. Considering all the changes I am trying to see if I can reconfigure my build to eek out more crits.
---
[camp shelters. right there dude. ](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4kRrC6daJSw0g4s5KpHdAS/48e7143814678898dcbd77dfdfbd389e/Fallout76_Season2_CommunityCalendar-EN-05.jpg)
---
[Edit: also right in the middle of the page for steel dawn](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/57zbNl1xvzWg8qOr9XjVN2/5124be8e293f1d22923f0aebca2837c6/Fallout76_Year2_General-Roadmap_v3_Horizontal-EN-07.jpg)
---
Well, I can’t solo.  But I do understand how they work so I have no problem rushing objectives so the team I’m on can get it under 8
---
Glad I could help, I’d suggest just trying it out solo first if you need some practice, some of the more hardcore folks can be abrasive if you don’t play the game they way they want you to. Even after just one solo run I feel like I have a good enough idea on what I need to be doing to be helpful and not a hinderance
---
That’s hilarious 😂 I haven’t played 76 since March and radtoads were a joke.
---
That's why they gave us 50 free perk coins, to compensate for all of us who had to shift stats around till we found our ideal loadouts upon hitting 50.
---
Builder??? My build is to fight but i can always switch cards and become a builder/ crafter. I also have most plans and recipes so tell me again what is that a "builder" ?
---
  Oh, i can also cook pretty much everything.
---
Maybe the interior camp building will be close to what we seek. Who knows what exact form it will take.
---
Apparently this is actually an ongoing problem for played between level 25-100. The enemies scaling health and armor doesn't match up to weapon damage scaling so without really dope rolls a lot of lower to mid level people are having trouble actually traveling anywhere now
---
That sucks, well with how much I am enjoying the balance changes and the one run I have managed to do of spec ops, plus the new seasons I can forgive them for not giving us micky night event. Sort of glad they didn't try to push out a crappy unfinished event.
---
The signal repeater to repair is right at the beginning. The first time I did it the quest marker was missing for some reason and I did the same thing as you, running around confused for a while before fast traveling out.
---
With luck at 15 every 3rd shot is a crit with savvy, also it's predictable which makes it more usefull I think.
---
There's a new road map up now. Interior instances is in December with the BOS quest. They're lumping all the BOS quests and questline in one release. Patch 23 is in October. There's a date on double xp, double score and other minor weekend events. Oh an 2 mole miner hunter events, one in October and another in November and holiday scorched returns in December.
---
Yep, 2nd try (solo) on Tuesday was 7:42. First solo attempt yesterday was 7:36. Looking forward to today's after work.
---
EDIT: Ok, did it in 7:28 solo on the first try (Freezing Super Mutants at Valley Galleria).
---
Fast Travel to White Spring isn't free....to your camp, it is.
---
Yeah game really need some form of a taunt for tank/full health builds.
---
Thx. Definitely not worth it if it won’t proc and fill on a crit. 4 perk ranks for a 14% chance to go from a 2:1 cycle to a 1:1 cycle isn’t worth it.
---
I had this problem. For the robots I found the signal repeater easy. It told me the distance to the yellow diamond.
---
I’ve attempted the vault twice by self and can’t find the damn thing. I’ve done it as group a few more times and completed it but I just can’t get it started 
---
I also didn’t realize you just stayed in the vicinity. After I was killed by the robots for the 10th time or so it just said “ok move on to the next. I thought it just gave it to me”
---
End game became easier, mid game got harder.
---
I don't expect this was intended.
---
The uplink progress bar goes much quicker with 4 people, which helps a ton in a spread out area like the Burrows.
---
seems like the only way to achieve a 1:1 cycle is with a 15%v weapon now. I'm gonna test it a bit more but it's not possible without unyielding, that's for sure. maybe with crit savvy 2. but yeah.
---
I just keep running and leave the enemies behind, when they catch up with me I welcome them with all I have.
---
Right forgot about that one. That one is handy.
---
So my loadout would be:
---
Taking one for the team
---
Master infiltrator
---
Ammo factory
---
Int
---
Agil
---
Endurance or luck?
---
This was pretty funny.
---
Yea, I was carrying a Vampire 3 star knife, also great for Path to Enlightenment, and I had the Radstag skin on it. Dumped it into the stash and grabbed the 2 star Deathclaw glove with extra claw. (sigh)
---
Kinda like tank armour in terraria
---
I don't think so sadly, but I am not always current on what's planned.
---
I do like planning builds though, so if you're wanting help planning your character change, I'd be happy to try and help!
---
Is it too much to ask for bethesda to make the game easier for everyone so I can go around and take pictures and hit enemies with my commie whacker
---
Who complains about having to make a build on a game like this? Seriously, you want the game to be easier for everyone so you can kill things with a toy mallet. Go play minecraft, but make sure to put it on creative mode that way you don't have to fight scary zombies. 
---
I never would of thought this many people have trash builds, seems half of you don't even want builds you just want easy mode. No enemies, only roleplaying. Gtfo of here with that crap, normally I'm cordial but seeing post day after day about people with POTATO builds whining and crying that the games too hard makes me so annoyed. 
---
"But I wanna explore and roleplay with my friends and I keep getting killed by molerats and my commie whacker doesn't work anymore :( Bethesda this nerf was too much" 
---
SHUT UP 
---
P.S. Do not even think of commenting to me "but I have a good build (sneak bloody rifleman and...)"
---
If youre a rifleman or gunslinger your build has always sucked, now it just extra sucks. 
---
End rant 
---
tl;dr get good
---
Edit: 1 downvote = 1 crybaby food build 
---
Keep em coming
---
50 minutes?!? Holy crap
---
Did you click on the summary at the end?
---
I'm at work but curious to know, it's Freezing Super Mutants today but is it at Valley Galleria?
---
Maybe it could be a beta Gary vault. The vault of Barry perhaps.
---
Why not just use fireproof instead of sizzling style? Isn’t 1 legendary perk slot more valuable than 3 normal perk slots
---
I was told something similar when GOT ended the god awful way that show did the last two seasons.  Writing and story structure went from the level of Lord of the Rings to some Sci-fi channel stew.  But it was the journey that was satisfying right?  No, a hot stinking pile of crap on top of a Vango makes an otherwise masterpiece just a painting with poo on it.
---
Agreed, so many told the PvP crew to go away or to bad well now you all know how it feels. I like one wasteland and this post shows that people were just used to easy mode and now are throwing a fit.
---
This is absolutely how the event should be done. Don’t waste time killing endless waves. Hold down the uplink.
---
Not the other side at all, same coast and less than a day’s drive (in real world conditions not FO conditions) away
---
You first?  What is going on here
---
Didn’t die in PA since I added the Electric Absorbtion perk this morning.
---
Make sure you add it , what defense perks do you have and what build?
---
Yeah, also those initial melee hits being ignored.
---
Nothing ruins my sprinting melee groove (and enjoyment) more than plowing into an enemy at mach 10 with my deathclaw hand, hearing the hit, seeing the damage number, and then crickets followed by an awkward cough as their health bar remains unaffected.
---
And then they open fire on me point blank.
---
Yep, and this latest FU to the players just cemented it in place.
---
It’s still happening to me *almost every score repeatable rank up.
---
Everyone before patch 22 "this game is too easy"
---
Everyone now "I have to fire 5 bullets instead of 1 I'm quitting"
---
I got it on my first attempt. It might be rare I don’t know. It’s like any reward though, gotta grind it out.
---
Uncommon to maybe rare. Grind it a few times you’ll get it.
---
I already invested points into agility in that list for the increased stealth damage. Survivability can easily be gained with better armour as well as the damage resist perks I already put in that build. Mutations can also help with damage and survivability or you can swap out that perk(s) for more intelligence and get first aid. I really don't see any loss to damage for the bow while using the heavy gun perks as a back up nor do I see any significant loss in survivability.
---
My build is an auto-rifle VATS build with like 2 endurance and I don't really have a problem with survivability. Even with the adrenal reaction mutation which, yes, I use on a non-bloodied full health build because I like the damage boost if things ever **do** get that rough.
---
Give us like 5 a level past 100 or something, seems fair to me. That’s 500 every 100 levels, isn’t too OP or anything
---
Wrong sub, here we use actual words to communicate.
---
A few posters I’ve seen have been very hypocritical about the difficulty
---
White knight, if you dont have it. Armor breaks slower, and is cheaper to repair.
---
yes it was buffed but it also didn't receive the boost from the riflemen perks.  After the buff I was testing to see if it would be a good alternative for my long range weapon to pick off enemies before they get close. Comparing the damage with all my perks equipped and all my perks taken off had the same damage amount.
---
Thanks for the tips, useful.
---
Then why are people like this whinning over not dealing enough damage, if they are clearly avoiding damage perks
---
Can we please stop with the hyperbole?  it’s not everyone, plenty of people are doing ok with mediocre builds.
---
I hate the idea of a threat free wasteland, it Fallout, it's supposed to be threatening and depressing. Not easy and hopeful
---
Problem is everybody loved mischief night and everybody hated hunting pailfaces.
---
Not much, got enough legendary endurance &amp; intelligence to buff my Fireproof to 3 and my Gunsmith to 5
---
They didnt test if for more then a month.. They are dumb.
---
Heavy gunner build. I blasted them down to no health then just gun butted them. worked pretty well. I did die a few time and spammed like 20 stimpaks. the rewards gave me them all back though!
---
Yeah but if we can skip a step (picking a perk card) and go straight to getting Perk Coins, we should.
---
Greedy and dumb
---
I welcome the challenge in the Wasteland
---
I don't agree. Because you are missing out on the AP regen torso, to get a chemist effect for example. Not worth. And if you dont equip PA, and get ap regen pieces, you can have both. Why is it so hard for you to understand?

Based on how it was coded,  taking away ability to cripple the queen was intentional too. Except that it wasn't intentional at all.  Just looking at the code, it appeared that taking away the ability to cripple the queen  had been done deliberately.  But that was not the case. We know this because Bethesda said so and because they fixed it like it was before.  If the description says that it only recharges fusion cores, I am fairly certain that's all that it's meant to do. I saw the angry turtle video. He stands there and let's the assaultron shoot him again and again and again.   That's very typical of his stuff, running tests in situations that don't resemble normal game play in any way.
---
Hol up
---
I'm nearing 100 too and have a bloodied build. The bloody L45 lever action I had was doing 1000-1200 dmg headshots, now it's down to 100-300 on the same enemies. I got a bloody exploding fixer to keep up and it's only marginally better - I still die a lot during events now, and that fixer often breaks before the event is over.
---
I don't see a reason to keep on playing if Bethesda is just going to keep cutting all of the progress I've made.
---
I'm considering cancelling Fallout 1st, but I'm worried about what will happen to the tens of thousands of junk scraps I've collected in my scrap box.
---
i will. thanks :)
---
I gotta be missing something here. I'm lvl 60 and I'm having zero issues with any creatures even getting me close to half health. I just picked perks I like and have no real build at all.
---
I got elder the second try, and had no Idea what I was doing. loser.
---
If you picked perk coins instead of a level up wouldn’t you only get two.... because of one card? Unless perk pack
---
Yes at Valley Galleria
---
you're right, i will. thanks :)
---
no, i was picking up ammo then it put me back in the game world.
---
I'll probably play less for awhile, forget about completing the new score run, ain't no way I'm going to spend even more time on that. I can tough it out, limit my events, but I'd say one of the big things that bothers me...
---
...I have to spend more time, more effort, more ammo, more everything, killing trash mobs, and what do I get? Same old chalk, hairbrushes, cotton yarn, scissors with occasional low end meds. At least they could have added some extra drop mats for the extra trouble.
---
Don’t worry, for just an extra $20/month, you can fix it with a new camp object 
---
- fixing things the Bethesda way, with cold hard cash...right after they break them on purpose.
---
 for free just do the beckett questline to get a 50 cal.
---
You must have missed where I noted I did drop one. That said I'm not going to run a silo and spend resources more than once so there server can have fun at my expense. I'm happy to share the load, but I'm not going to do all the work.
---
I guess, but I didn't see any other legendary perks I cared about. I'm running Rank 3 Funky Duds, Rank 3 Ammo Factory, Rank 1 Master Infiltrator, Rank 2 Sizzling style, and Rank 2 Follow Through.
---
u/sameolddog meet mr Val. He's looking for a wendigo plushie but hes on pc. If you dont have it I figure it wont be long before you do again! 
---
Dog is good people Mr. V. Ask away
---
I have a feeling that the better Legendary perk cards are in reserve. There are supposed to be 24 or 26 legendaries?
---
I’m glad you asked!!
---
Here’s a solid lead farming route that doesn’t require using Lucky Hole Mine. That will let you save up your Acid to make Gunpowder as needed. If you need places to farm Steel, I recommend running Uranium Fever whenever it shows up. During my last run I ended up with over 1k Steel from scrapping all the gear they dropped. You can also reference this doc for Steel or other resources:  https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic
---
**This is the route I use:** *(The #c at the end is how many caps it takes to Fast Travel from the previously listed spot. The entire route costs about 100 caps. If your C.A.M.P. is placed along the route somewhere (mine is near Silo Alpha, for example) you can reduce this as well as have a guaranteed spot to dump your loot easily. And having the Survival Tent will make this easier, especially after the silo runs.)*
---
+ Green Country Lodge (40 Lead Scrap) 9c from Vault 76
---
+ Eastern Regional Penitentiary (80 Lead Scrap) 18c  (or 12c from Vault 76)
---
+ Missile Silo Bravo (80 Lead Scrap) 10c
---
+ Pleasant Valley Cabins &amp; Ski Resort (90 Lead Scrap) 17c
---
+ Missile Silo Alpha (80 Lead Scrap) 4c
---
+ Monorail Elevator (80 Lead Scrap) 17c
---
+ Missile Silo Charlie (80 Lead Scrap) 13c
---
+ Charleston Fire Department (80 Lead Scrap) 18c
---
It’s usually about 600 Lead Scrap, give or take. For the silos, just run in to the gym on the first floor, grab the weights and run out. For the monorail elevator, wear your Power Armor (it’s a long drop if you misstep).
---
600 lead scrap should get you about 9600 rounds of 5.56 with Ammosmith 2, Ammo Factory 4 &amp; Super Duper 3. If you make sure that your damage perks are optimized, you can usually kill most enemies with just a few rounds. 
---
That run above doesn’t even factor in Luck Hole mine or the random lead you can pick up from other world items. Make sure Lead is one of your tagged junk items and just pick up items that show as tagged with the magnifying glass. 
---
With just a short time dedicated to an efficient run, you can have more than enough ammo. I run a .50 cal on my main, currently have 20K+ rounds for that and still craft and sell about 30-40k 5.56 rounds every week (note; that was *before* the Ammo Factory Legendary perk. I expect to sell possibly **twice** as much now.)
---
Edit:  Also, this run is repeatable. After you end up at Charleston Fire Department, head over to Summerville to the ‘Professor’s House’. There are about 250 burned books in there. Gather them all for the cloth, and that will easily push you past the ‘running loot list’ limit of 180 or 255 or whichever it is right now. 
---
Then world hop, and do the run all over again. The loot will respawn.
---
I hated hunting the pails as well, didn't even get what I wanted from them and had to trade lol. I didn't get to take part in the Mischief event last year 😔
---
Some mods break the end screen so pressing escape doesn't give you the award screen.
---
and the one in white spring is a bit of a jaunt to get to in your camp you can put it right by the entry
---
Brain Fungus Soup for Herbivore, Cooked Scorchbeast Brain (or whatever it's called) for Carnivore. Or Canned Dog Food, really just anything.
---
The basic joy of fallout games is replayability, going into the game with a character and being that person in this world.  FO76 is the first fallout game I've played where it's incredibly hard to just restart.  The world doesn't feel right for it.  The grind doesn't feel right for it.  Even level progression doesn't feel right for it.  Even with NPCs now, I don't even think they are built for it. I haven't tried to see if there's alternate dialog based on character setup.
---
Zero karma, zero post, less than a year old account says Bethesda did a thing well.
---
Yeah, those dusty Bethesda accounts will be the only ones saying that...ever.
---
Check all the “positive” remarks friends, all made accounts right before or after this games launch and all with low to no karma outside of other Bethesda accounts upvoting here in this sub.
---
They use literally zero effort to try to promote themselves, just 
---
Ike everything else they do.
---
Field Surgeon is so underrated. Love that I have the Charisma now to use it. Also, I only use Born Survivor when I'm in a heavy combat scenario. Really not something I equip outside of Earle or SBQ.
---
Top tip: if you are going to solo daily ops create your own team
---
First one is free. Next one is 1000 atoms when you realize the new build doesn't work cause you don't have the gear for it.
---
I haven't seen a few of those items actually, but I can vaguely imagine how it looks and I bet it looks great!
---
It seems like the same boring game to me.
---
Gotta love weight reducing perk cards
---
I imagine leading high level enemies to someone's camp or something similar.
---
most players seem to like and most players dont have crazy complicated builds or OP weapons.
---
Seriously! Like who are these people that are struggling with this so much? 3-5 total perk points into combat and you should be able to continue wandering the map and hoarding junk without much difficulty. I feel like everyone upset about One Wasteland is screaming: "I demand that I not have to understand how the game works or put any thought behind how my character will survive!"
---
Yeah, quitting is probably the best for you. If you had problems before in this game, it just doesn’t seem like this is the game for you.  There were problems with this games math that made it too easy to stack multiple things and thus removed any challenge and need for many of the items in the game.  Or you can try to find some other like minded people and get a small group together and team up.  Or just wait for a single player fallout 5 to come out and then modify the difficulty to meet your needs.
---
I much prefer this difficulty it’s suppose to be a wasteland not a camping trip
---
If we close to losing the sub 8 min time I burn it down just to be safe but other then that I try to wait as long as I can
---
oh gosh, thank you for this! :D
---
Nope, that didn’t do it. Weird!
---
And yet you're still worse off than a character that didn't shift stats in the first place, with a relative penalty that keeps increasing.
---
I keep getting left behind by my lower level team members. As soon as they are out of the room that I'm in, sometimes a dozen enemies will spawn in my room, blocking my way out. I'm not exaggerating either. In the first room of the first op, they left before I could reload and there were ten robots directly behind me against the wall, and more in front of me. I died twice before I could catch up, and my teammates (who had clearly done this once or twice already that day) were already on the second uplink. I kept dying and didn't even get a shot in on the final boss, because I'm not familiar with the Burrows, and kept getting lost in addition to being overwhelmed. I don't know if more enemies spawn for higher-levels, or if it's just that enemies spawn a certain amount behind the majority of the party in order to "catch up" to them. But if you don't slow down for your slowest member, it's really hard to keep everyone near the boosters.
---
I took hours choosing the smart way to do it last night for example sometimes it’s more beneficial wasting a perk card point from an unchosen perk card to drop that special stat and buff another before using the legendaries because your first card (&amp;point) is free , the next 50 but then another 100 for the next &amp; so on in increasing amounts. I was the opposite to you and wanted to keep agility etc high whilst increasing strength , it was most beneficial &amp; economical to waste 3 unselect old perk cards points first lowering perception , agility , luck and then choosing 4 legendary perks (including strength ) and then scrapping my cards and scrapping out the unused perk card points before spending  that 100 legendary perks points on each 2 get extra 2 special points for those specials if that makes sense ? It was a bit tricky figuring it out but I never wasted anything and got maximum bang for my bucks . This way I got to move 3 points to strength plus an extra 2 from the new legendary special , and the other new legendary specials I selected replaced that list point and gave me an extra
---
Mostly the glowing Radstags that spawn and gouge me to death
---
I’ve done SBQ once since patch. It might just have been me, but it sure seemed like they increased the size and frequency of the mobs. Unfortunately, it was also much laggier (more laggy?) than last time I did it.
---
I did this with my main because it’s more convenient, but I’m doing the same thing. Also for my wife and a few friends, they ring me the mats and I’ll churn out a bunch for them. 
---
My wife did her lead run yesterday and I turned her 500 lead into 8000 5.56 rounds.
---
I am with you on that. I am still completing my West Tek to Whitespring station run with relative ease. I have only used my Anti-armor explosive laser rifle so far, but I do plan on experimenting with other weapon types.
---
Ah cool, I got you.  I realize that some people wouldn't like it, but then I have strange taste in music compared to most people I know.
---
But certainly we could use some more music variety, and since the Atom Shop music is already in the game files I just figure it would be an easy way to get some more variety added and I figured I couldn't be the only one who liked the music.
---
They fixed the bug that allowed the quest to autocomplete.  So the bug was removed.
---
Its really good with shotguns because each pellet counts, pretty much every shot fills the meter.
---
Hahaha no problem. Im a reddit angel. What i do
---
I only engage them from elevated  places.   And while were at it, fuck mireluck kings too.
---
You need a life too.
---
Have you not seen how cobbled together the rest of this game is?  
---
That they got ops to work this well with only that sacrifice is very very applaudable.
---
Most games with sneak mechanics that arent Metal Gear tend to be incredibly laughable by comparison. It's easy to see why they went the route they did. 
---
If they hadn't far fewer of these ops would be completed in time with stealthed players lagging a mile behind.
---
I mean, event if it is intentional, it only gives resistance to one type of damage and is entirely situational. For me personally, energy damage is not even that big of a problem. So even if it's intentional, it's wasted perk points  to anyone with a decent build.
---
Also keep in mind that we have perks like sizzling style and funky duds, and their descriptions specify that their purpose is to protect against specific types of damage.  If electric absorption really was intended to protect against energy damage, then why wouldn't it say  so in the description?
---
It doesn't mention damage resistance in the description because that's not the intent of the perk.
---
What are you doing? I get struggles with OA but base game too?
---
It really sounds like you're treating this game like a run &amp; gun shooter when it's more a tactical shooter with heavy resource management mechanics.
---
Maybe you need a redo of you character &amp; do things smarter this time around.
---
I am in the camp that thinks this update was a good thing. It used to be so easy it was boring. I could do scorched earth and barely pay attention to what I was doing. With Gun Fu and full Unyielding, I could use VATS for days without stopping or even aiming. 
---
Now the game feels like more of a challenge. Scorched Earth and ACP feel like a real boss fight. I'm still ridiculously powerful, and the legendary Ammo Factory perk has made my ammo crafting SO much better, so I don't need to grind resources like I used to. 
---
I'm in.
---
I should note that I run a highly optimized Bloodied Stealth Commando, so I was a god before this, and still very powerful. Honestly, Funky Duds has patched my Achilles' heel: poison. Now nothing can hurt me, so it's fair to have to use a few more bullets.
---
Yeah I feel bad for people having a rough ride but I love this patch.
---
I started with a character before and following the overseer and meeting her were just sort of automatically in my data quest it look like. I made dumb choices with the special on that character so I started a new one. But nothing showing up! Not even meet the overseer
---
No idea but if your on ps4 I can give you one
---
You could probably even do Ghoul infestation OPS similar to this idea but in Metro's and dark areas as well
---
They mentioned in the patch notes they were fixing that daily, so people couldn't complete it more than 1x per day. 
---
Maybe it got removed during the patch as part of the fix.
---
I don’t have meet the overseer as a quest either sadly
---
Yes. So much more in an already laggy game.
---
I used this video for help to build my camp: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glqdn9XLeYo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glqdn9XLeYo)
---
It's kind of bullshit.
---
3 successful Elder completions, and **2** with no rare rewards.
---
All I have so far is a stupid Gutter plan
---
The game is STILL ridiculously easy, and I just started a new character. I think people just kind of suck lmao.
---
he wants to trade a two shot, faster fire rate, faster movement speed while aiming lever action for an anti armor or two shot 50 cal.
---
This makes no sense
---
I can't. I die before I can kill one enemy.
---
All fine for me. 
---
Gatling gun with anti armor and all the heavy weapon perks. 
---
Enemy’s die in 1-5 hits average is about 2-3 hits. Not counting ops robots... Fine for me. 
---
I do about +500 to over 1000 ammo per ops. I don’t see any problem. 
---
That enemy’s eat some more bullets at the mid level range was normal for me before the update. 3-4 different guns with different ammotypes solved this problem just fine. 
---
At level 80 my stock fixer and huntingrifle without any perks are working fine or at least ok for me. Same with the other weapons except shotgun. This thing works only on unarmored enemy’s. But I only have heavy gunner perks... 
---
Balance is perfect for me. 
---
There is no reason to oneshot everything and there is no problem to craft ammo or do ops for ammo. 
---
It’s the fucking wasteland. Scavenge for your shit and don’t expect to get served everything on a golden plate.
---
It was the most common reward for me, aside for cursed weapons. I have an extra if you want it, on Xbox, but I won’t be able to get on until Monday.
---
definitely once of the best events I did. piercing gaze was really annoying but in a good way, forced me to actually aim and stop spamming vats as i was no longer in sneak mode. but it could get old fast playing solo. will try some team ups and see what happens.
---
So far I have completed all 3 ops solo. Gotta say, Electric Absorbtion maxed out was one of the best decisions I could have made. So far all 3 enemy types have had lasers or energy damage which makes the experience very trivial as I never take damage.
---
Hmmm... like you are whistling to a dog, over here, over here gesture.
---
Tried one by myself and failed due to the constant respawns and me thinking I needed to deal with everything. Noted what I did wrong, tried with a group, and so far two for two on elder. Seriously though, I almost wish the BOS guy would give you something like a hustle and move to next objective order a few times.
---
Agreed. That's why I don't run bloodied on any of my characters.
---
It still is easy. Got elder solo on my second Daily Op. What a fucking joke.
---
basically if youre using shotguns use this if not savy is better.
---
Now the real question. Do they allow you to shut off that damn music in there?. I like that area but steer clear as the music makes me nuts. Even with the Dailey to find vacuum tubes, I would log off and log back in to avoid the area.
---
I'm from pc
---
Exploding Blood Eagles was great. It was like being in a cartoon. "Pew pew BOOM! Pew pew BOOM!"
---
I recently purchased a 1\* and as a stealth commando build it's insane. 'Grats on your roll dude sure you're gonna have fun with that baby!
---
Secret service helmet and the new BOS outfit is my current look
---
im on xbox, no mods. i was trying to kill all the enemies at the start but i guess they're endless.
---
Yo this game is easy as fuck so you should probably stick to Nintendo games or something that has a more tailored experience.
---
Pretty sure you need to go to the wayward first. I’m not positive though.
---
Hey thanks  - to answer your questions, I'm running 9 mutations w max class freak, strange in numbers and a pretty even spread of other perks, always play in a team and rarely do anything solo except dailies.  I'm using a furious handmade with exp rounds(max demo perk).  The problem seems to be very recent.  Up until a few days ago I could take hits like it was nothing and now I can't take 2 bites from a stingwing.  I don't use chems and for combat I typically take a distance approach.  
---
I appreciate the assistance, like I said this exact same character a week ago was my best build and had zero problems, and after the patch I'm just getting shredded.
---
Hi everyone,
---
You’ve all shared a ton of great feedback about One Wasteland so far, and we’ve been reading and talking through all of it. We agree that there are some adjustments we can make to One Wasteland to improve the experience, in particular for characters in the mid-level range. This is something we’re actively working on, but the changes aren’t finalized yet. We’re aiming to include more details in an upcoming Inside the Vault, and then hotfix in the coming weeks. Please keep sharing your thoughts in the meantime, we appreciate it!
---
I got one from killing that mutated windigo thing, after getting ass blasted ofcource
---
Yay, they delayed perk loaudats once more... Surerly what one guy made ( perk loadout mod) can be done by 3 AAA company. Shame on bethesda....
---
I just remember last time I played I was in event with others who had higher lv then me and I kept dying every 10 seconds and did 0 damage
---
Makes sense to me. All of sudden every ACP Earl won’t stop just following me around when I’m in stealth. He can’t detect me unless I just sit there but it’s like having a puppy chasing me
---
Also true, hopefully
---
Seems to be the common mindset right now.
---
You’re welcome!
---
The one thing I found was that Stealth Attacks from VATS are not working whatsoever. 
---
I'm doing more damage ADS'ing in Stealth with headshots than I am with VATS.
---
It's giving me notifications whilst ADS'ing but not while using VATS.
---
The Health bar and ammo used is also proving it to me. 
---
Some people are having the opposite problem, they're doing more in VATS than they are while ADS'ing. 
---
Something is up with the Stealth Mechanic, I imagine it'll be one of the next fixes as it's causing every single perk card relative to CRIT, VATS and Stealth to essentially be obsolete (Stealth not completely, but it's still a pain in the behind).
---
I found one on a gun truck somewhere in the toxic valley. usually just scrap it for mods.
---
Thank you, this is straight facts. People need to get thier heads out of their asses and stop looting shit before the op is complete
---
My wallet doesn't love it. This is just a scheme meant to have us all grinding more &amp; buying more repair kits.
---
Well it's kinda already in files but the autoaxe will be coming
---
I get so much xp, meds, ammo, some scrip and also legendaries from running ops and they are pretty quick/repeatable. Silos/queen/earle give me...stuff too....i guess...
---
1) I’d say it’s probably decent for listening to a podcast, maybe less so now that there’s npcs but your good to listen to something just don’t fully mute the game
---
2) No content has been removed, the only unavailable content are some of the limited cosmetics which I’m sure will come back for a chance to get again later, as well as some exploits have been removed. The general experience is a tad different now that they added npcs but as for content everything is still here 
---
3) It seems like updates will be coming for a long time still I don’t see them stopping anytime soon
---
Liercing gaze will be there all the time, I've moved to a hair trigger for my B2525 handmade and man, it did work this event. Some of these will def require teams for 95% of people. A select few may 8min mark the first daily ops solo but not me, that was so damn annoying
---
Did you decorate Gary Tower, too? :0
---
i'm on pc but thank you! i really appreciate the offer :)
---
Ok jan.
---
Community events are fun. Solo enemy hunts are boring. Its like they forget this is an MMO.
---
Don't forget 1 star cloaking wood pieces.
---
When I'm not in PA I run a mix of SS and Urban Scout, multiple unyielding pieces.  Both net me around the same results.
---
While you're "downed" but not dead, you still count as long as you're in range of the signal repeater. So just stay down to conserve your stimpaks and ammo until you finally die, respawn and run back. Like you noticed, sometimes you can complete the signal repeater while you're down.
---
After you beat the boss it gives you 5ish minutes to open the results page and leave before booting you out. You will have still received the rewards in your inventory but without opening the results page you will have to go through and figure it out manually.
---
Junkie heavy here too. For as bad as I heard we were getting the nerf, I haven’t really felt it.
---
Wait for the "its unfair" types who fail to see they can use other people's benches even if the dont make the run.
---
Stealth Attacks from VATS are non-existent for myself and a lot of other folk I've talked to about it.
---
I’ll try this thanks!
---
I mean I wanted to do it with a team, but the team I joined weren’t doing Daily Ops
---
Yeah, I still run the perk for fixing guns maxed out on my heavy weapon character and "Officer Friendly" my shotgun/pistol character...mainly because for one the high rate of fire and the other has mostly explosive weapons and they break SO fast.
---
I think it would make a huge difference in the game if they were to tone those aspects back a lot.
---
no, it's not the same. if you have 2 hours on one character and i have 4 on 2 then i end up progressing the same as you. the point is that if you spend time in the game you should progress. with something that needs as much investment as legendary perks you get shafted for wanting more than one character... they already solved that problem in ESO with the champion system. the need for a lot of time is fine, the need for a lot of time on each character is not.
---
I'd love to see That gun, hunting revolver, 12.7mm SMG, and the 4570 govt rifle or whatever it was
---
Yeah, most people I know who run non weapons/armour vendors, myself included, are loving this added bonus. 
---
Ammo has value again (across more than just the ammo eating heavies). Same with aid, and Chems. 
---
Loving it.
---
Its gone so we have to do the mission for real, so now i never have to talk to Ward ever again.
---
I was doing a one handed melee build to be the tank for my wife. That way monsters attacked me instead of her. Still hard when my main legendary weapon breaks constantly. Plus I get riddled with bullets against 5+ supermutants or scorched before I can even kill one.
---
I’m going to try this in a bit and post an update. Thank you.
---
It’s a game bro, it’s absolutely the best place to goof around. It’s just been made into a chore.
---
This debate really makes me wish there was a better Survival difficulty. Currently the game feels more like FO4 "Normal" difficulty, with no way to change that.
---
H&amp;K and the Wattz 2000.
---
Yeah but once you realise that they aren’t going to join create your own team.
---
I hate grinding xp but thankfully xp buffs and certain events can help me obtain a level a day if not 5
---
Hey not every game is going to be for everyone. I have friends that couldn’t come to 76 simply because they rely so heavily on the massive slowdown that VATS causes in the previous games.  You can’t do that here in 76.  My friend simply is not good enough for her to react in this game.  
---
Unless again you had some friends to play with.  We’ve all seen the trope of the character in a movie or book that basically an escort quest because they have skills that no one else has.  Go for a max CHA build, share awesome perks, and let them all deal with the enemies while you hide behind cover and occasionally fire your pistol from behind yelling “Did I get him?”
---
I recall this quest tripping me up for a good while. I think the key wound up being in the Hornwright company building. Was it in the basement?
---
I agree. Super fun in there. Much better than resilient robots in the burrows. That one was ruff
---
Biv is love, Biv is life
---
I mean, even if this is how it's supposed to work, I don't think the perk is worth it. Fusion cores aren't that hard to get, and damage from energy weapons isn't that big of a problem, at least for me.
---
Bullet sponges aren't interesting when I myself am not a bullet sponge.
---
The answer used to be "No" for acid.   The answer is still "No" for steel.   
---
I can get about 1000 steel running from Westek to Huntersville and using the Scrapper perk.  Uranium Fever yields upwards of 500 steel.  There are other methods like the glass caverns and pulling ultacite. 
---
For acid, we used to be able to extend Campfire Tales out to about 90 minutes by maxing out each stage.  With 2 to 3 players in the area, you could get about 900 acid firm the Bloodbugs.  But they nerfed it and it now has a fixed timer of about 30 minutes.
---
There was also a method where you could use a syringer to constantly make bloatflies and farm them.  Not sure if this has been nerfed or not. 
---
The next best acid farm was Faschnact.  The beeswax at the Honey House could be scrapped for acid.  And if you hopped servers to double-dip you would have ended up with a lot of acid.
---
That being said, there are still decent farm spots for acid.  The train yard near Watoga typically has 5 to 6 Snallygasters.  About 4 Yao Gui spawn at the Col Kelly monument and the same South of Wavy Willards.  Plus there are the cave crickets at Tanagra Town.  And you can always take Hemlock Holes, which has 3x acid nodes.
---
There's a check when you receive the quest that removes the items from your inventory.
---
Maybe one of the Bethesda guys see this and we get a little Atom Shop S&amp;M 💋
---
What do you mean?
---
That sounds like a reasonable system.
---
The other option, also from Blizzard, is from Diablo 2.  As a quest reward (Act 1, Quest 1) they let you respec once per difficulty (3 times total).  It's a known value, 3 total so player knows he has option, but to treat it with some care.
---
If you go with the gold option.  Make the first respect, like a 75% discount, for the week after an update with major gameplay changes.
---
[fo wiki lists ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gatling_gun#Locations) a possible quest reward, a possibly spawn location and a possibly vendor for the plan.
---
Ouch, yeah that should be fixed.  Or at least give us the option to not Auto Unlock.
---
Damn, are you me?!?!
---
I'll be 50 quite soon and am a lifelong gamer... I stopped playing after I finished season 1 of the legendary run and am not at all looking forward to returning.
---
I have a solid stealth commando build, all of the "useful" mutations (short of speed demon... maybe when they remove hunger/thirst debuffs) and an AA/FFR Fixer that shreds anything short of bosses.
---
With the insane bullet sponginess coupled with supposed breaking of VATS stealth multipliers AND stealth issues in general, I don't see myself returning anytime soon. This game was already a chore in too many ways, so making everything take forever to kill is just another grind atop all of the existing grinds.
---
No thanks, Bethesda.
---
After One Wasteland I'm afraid to go to the Kelly Monument. Normally 10-12 Radstags spawn there and I don't want to be known as the guy who died to a hoard of level 50+ deer...
---
To get any meaningful rewards you need to complete it in under 12 minutes
---
It worked for me
---
Because, sometimes, I like things that are round.
---
Still the powerfist
---
Gotta make sure you make contact as soon as possible tho, is tricky pulling and holding onto agro when you want it.
---
The summary at the end will tell you what you got. Usually at least one guaranteed legendary and some rare rewards if you complete it under a certain amount of time. 50 minutes is a tiny bit over one of the time limits.
---
Hi! Wanted to say thank you to /u/FrenklanRusvelti and everyone else who has been posting about their experiences so far. I posted about this [in another thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iuc6yy/health_scaling_and_the_biggest_problem_with_one/) but wanted to mention it here too: 
---
We're reading and discussing all of your feedback, and we agree that there are some tweaks we can make to improve on One Wasteland, especially to help out the experience for mid-level characters. The details of those changes aren't ready just yet, but we're looking to share more in an upcoming article, and then hotfix in the weeks to come. Thanks again for all the feedback, please keep it coming!
---
Yup, just people who have become complacent and lazy actually having to turn off autopilot to play now throwing tantrums
---
I'm still able to one shot everything besides bosses so not sure how this is an issue
---
You are absolutely correct. A workshop is inviting challenge, regardless of if it's wanted or not.
---
Ah yeah, you do have to be tanky to do it solo. Or perhaps sneaky if they don't have the perception modifier.
---
I wish I had the communist protectron. But also I have the perks for extra meds, and I still run out of stimpaks. I'm a melee build and I get riddled with holes when I go into somewhere with 4 or more gunners.

Is this even happening? The complaints I see is people who had viable builds before patch 22 have had their playstyles get hammered into oblivion. The other issue is lower level players can't fight basic creatures anymore without exhausted all of their ammo, making levels 20-50 extremely unforgiving.
---
That would be awesome if it was truly fixed
---
Yes, games are meant to be played a certain way. But this game is now a massive chore, and instead of being a nice Fallout game where you can relax, you’re constantly on edge looking for that level 100 Mirelurk Steelshell that’s about to rape you while you’re just trying to farm materials.
---
The estate keycard I found in the basement in the summer house after it disappeared. And now when I try to get the next keycard that you print from the terminal in the estate it just doesn't work :((
---
Highly unlikely. Our appearance is far too human like to be an early-gen synth, and the Institute doesn’t yet exist either. 
---
Now... maybe we just all *think* it’s 2103. Maybe it’s really *23*03 and this is an elaborate historical simulation for a museum.
---
Yeah fuck those dandies that spend all their time building camps.
---
Man, I would kill for a chest or something at the end that would have all the dropped ammo inside (or even like 50% of it) so I wouldn't have to run back through the maze looking for all the paper bags or meat piles to try to recoup some of the ammo I used in the OP in the couple of minutes it gives me before getting kicked out.  It doesn't even have to have the stims and grenades and stuff, just ammo.  Though now that I better understand that running past most enemies to the objectives is what you should be doing, it does make collecting a bit easier as the coorpses aren't spread out everywhere.  But last night in the vault, so many of the bags were hidden in the weeds, and quite a few bags (and meat piles and bodies) I could see but couldn't collect for some reason.
---
Just a wish list item, obviously not necessary but sure would be nice.
---
Pepsi is Southern. Created in North Carolina.
---
Hi, I like the update. My account is 3 years 7 months old. I was a secret plant by Bethesda placed here on Reddit *before* FO76 was even launched, because Reddit is the indicator of all video game successes and the glorious Howard knew this. You got me.
---
The patch reversed this. If I was in an area with too high of leveled enemies, I would turn back. Now everywhere has multiple enemies at my level. Which isn't good when there's 10 supermutants gunning me down as I try to hit them with my melee weapon.
---
Yeah, day 1 was tough. 
---
Yesterday though, me and a random I teamed up with were clearing that daily op in 7 minutes a bunch of times. He was a beast of a build though, definitely hard carried me.
---
In the event of keys mebe see if someone whose completed It can open any doors for you. 
---
Had to do that with the mayor for a day quest, game was just not letting me into the sabatours office despite having had every thing it needed to open it.
---
It's not our age... my reflexes have diminished (as they do with anyone that's in our demo), it's the fact that they've conflated "takes forever to kill" with "challenging" or "fun".
---
I'm sure I'd be fine with One Wasteland from the perspective of completing content and not feeling like every piece of gear is going to break all of the time... but bull sponges are \*NOT\* fun nor are they challenging. Just most frustration based gaming to pad those engagement numbers.
---
Idk but my energy weapons have been beasts since the update came out, they’re doing 1.5x as much as my same firerate and same legendary roll ballistics
---
Not fun to be a melee person fighting metal rovots or balisstic fighting metal robots lol
---
Good information to know!
---
No problems here really with bloodied gauntlet myself. However I'm switching the build over to War Glaive as soon as I get it
---
Seriously though, for a skin that was offered with the battle pass, you would have thought that they would have tackled this already. But sadly no, I'm with you man my vendors haven't shown up for the past month, and I'm not willing to rebuild my camp because it's a legacy build.
---
assault gas mask with scavenger outfit and regular green backpack, had it since the beginning!
---
It worked for me just fine and it counted
---
Now would be a good time for Bethesda to buff explosive weapons. And just to make it fairer, make them a bit harder to find.
---
It's leg day my dude
---
I am saying we are a separate model. Model made by Vault Tec.
---
Oh you’re right, it’s 3 not NV. But still the time frame doesn’t line up at all.
---
In Fallout 4, if you wanted danger you went to Quincy or the Glowing Sea. Maybe Far Harbour if you got that DLC. In 76, if you wanted a safe(r) area, you went to the forest.
---
I forget the name of it, but I think that base where you turn in the technical data has an armory with one sitting on a table in it
---
I have noticed that, too. All enemies seem to be doing this now. It's like you have stealth until you take a shot, and then it's broken, even if you're still undetected, have high agility, the right perks, and are using silenced weapons.
---
I soloed it last night and got elder but it was very close.
---
I prioritize camp building in this game and regularly farm up mats for buff food and chems, but am not having much issue with the changes. 
---
Just had to swap back to my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet over my preferred bloodied faster swing speed cultist dagger.
---
Would really prefer to be using that dagger tho, really hope daggers and pistols get looked into next for rebalance.
---
I am two shotting anything with my vampire death claw gauntlet.  One shot on power attack except legendaries. No perks. Strength from unyielding and food. It is a backup to my heavy guns. Is a full spec unarmed still taking two hits to kill?
---
This was in daily ops to be clear.
---
Making deathclaws terrifying as well as any other notorious Fallout enemy YES. Making every single enemy in the game a metaphorical deathclaw? NO thanks.
---
I don't see how getting owned by ants and radroaches and making every single gathering run a chore is seen as an improvement.
---
Seems like bethesda wants to make the game a looter shooter instead of an actual sandbox. This is what upsets people I think. Enabling a wide varienty of builds and playstyles is what a sandbox should be about.
---
Doesn't mean that every build needs to be even near super effective no. But it should at least be useable. Before this patch most things in my opinion were usable. But right now hardly anything is. They should just remove all the different perk cards, weapons/items, etc and let us select from 3 different "super" builds and be done with it.
---
Every single friend I have has stopped playing F76 due to this. We didn't play this as some sort of looter shooter trying to find god gear and builds, but as a way to wind down from work. Doing a little of everything in not so super efficient ways but we had fun. THIS? this is NOT fun.
---
Probably *after* the "Bombs Fall" event, so it runs through Halloween.
---
Mediocre is right lol
---
Not sure how rare but I've got like 4-5 piled up now. I'm on Xbox if you need one.
---
Can you post your build and what level are you've? I've seen a few threads like this and its not hard to perk for a weapon type and still have "QOL" perks to fit your playstyle.
---
Ive always played a fullhealth rifleman. I switched to bloodied about a month ago. Never followed a build online but im optimized for commando now but even before going bloodied things were fine. This updates had almost no affect on my play style.
---
My girlfriend plays a rifleman very casually and her build is not optimized, she's not having much trouble from what I can tell. She runs a non legendary fixer.
---
This updates the first in a while that im really happy with, finally giving some attention to the gameplay itself. Im very pleased with it.  They have said this change was to allow for easier future balancing so if it is an issue like im reading it will likely get addressed. But am curious about your level and build. I would say its a given youll want to max 2 of your 3 weapon perk cards. I keep commando cards maxed and when I want to run heavy weapons I pull 2 weight perks and get 6 points in heavy gun cards.
---
Try comparing your ballistic and energy weapons to see for yourself.
---
chlain
---
Idk man, it's going to take alot to make me leave my sh with my jetpack arm. Spent a lot of time in the vault raid to get it haha
---
uuhhh
---
Explain it to me like I'm 5. This made no sense to me lol
---
Yeah, I must be onto something
---
Agreed, keeps people from building insanely powerful builds without having to think about it. I like knowing that most players will screw themselves over with a careless build. It makes level actually mean something now
---
I could not agree with you more!  A little more challenging, but that is good. It was getting so boring to one shot everything. Now instead of one bullet it takes two bullets.
---
A beverage for this would be great. Call it Aggro Absinthe, enemies are more likely to attack you for 2 minutes
---
I have a tiny fledging playlist I started compiling recently that you might like, so far it's just a couple of tracks but I hope to add more as I find them.
---

---
You can always ask a friend or even a random if they can craft one for you. Some will do it for free. Some for caps. Or some just for the materials you use.  
---
I know that’s not the answer you wanted to get, but you’d be surprise how often a player will help you simply because they can. 
---
I’ve crafted so many lever action rifles and handmade for low level people that asked me
---
This would be awesome. I am just getting comfortable with my perk cards and PA. I love reminds me of marine armor from Starcraft and the taunt would remind me a lot of Diablo 2.... this barbarian had that. Reduced taunted enemies defenses temperately also if I recall.
---
Great idea!!
---
happening to me too XB1 and i didn’t purchase levels
---
I don’t think it has anything to do with the armor values though, I’m talking about the damage card in the pip boy
---
I think it’s pretty common. I’ve used one and put 3 more for sale and I’ve done the quest no more than 10 times
---
Melee was an unfortunate pick. It suffered more than most during OA.
---
wait what? they already canceled all the content they announced today? fuck!
---
Can you imagine the Brahmins so buff they actually kill the sheepsquatch 😁
---
Just to clarify, This was before the update: I had an AA/E/FR Lever action rifle and was doing 600+ damage every headshot. I’m not saying it doesn’t need a buff, just curious what your damage numbers are now
---
I'm not min-maxed but run a sort of sneak bloody commando build. without sneak damage i was challenged but in a good way. i don't think i could solo that any faster though so will need to team up. 
---
I find that with f76 being too op is not fun in this game but on the other hand the bland shooting and general game playing mechanics make playing at less than op level also not fun. 
---
I liked this event as it challenged me and forced me to shoot properly and try use my skill rather than rely on buffs and game mechanics. I think they found a good balance in that regard.
---
I can see my own camp fine with the skin equipped but my friend isn't able to fast travel, haven't tested it with vendors yet but I was really hoping it was fixed on PC
---
I did mine yesterday no issue.
---
Are you sure the terminal was locked?
---
Love your Buddy Hack-It. I have one very similar, called charisma. Those axes are a fun way to do a Whitesprings xp run.
---
Since the intro of T65, I found the other PA types to be spongy.  However, a full set of T65 is like a tank.  
---
I was doing Earl in Ultacite armour and had to use a ton of stims.   With a full set of T65 I've been using them much less.
---
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that you need to complete the set.
---
And you just had to grind bullion.
---
Imagine those who grinded a full set of godly secret service! At leas i grinded vault 94 armor that is always 3 stars.
---
I don't think we'll see a stronger armor anyway. I think they will take the path of effects,like vault 94 armor. Something like "with a full set incoming melee attacks freeze the enemy".
---
Death to melee builds, bout time
---
My Junkie's two-handers are doing just fine. I have an Instigating FSS +1 STR super sledge that is just wrecking.
---
I refuse to subscribe to FO1st - what hoarded gear?
---
And also the gauss minigun should be doing less than the plasma. The gauss mini does ballistic damage not energy, so it has to go through 100 DR compared to only 75 ER for the plasma
---
2 Razorgrain, 3 Corn, 3 Boiled Water, 3 Wood. Just got the recipe today from hitting Elder tier on the daily op.
---
Probably a technical thing like making it so the right perks get equipped and apply their effects properly.
---
Also they probably want to put more effort in and make the UI for it more flashy in comparison to a player made mod that just merely switches it.
---
That being said they should have made this quality of life change first.
---
Afaik It stays and you can use it up, you just can't add back into it I believe.
---
Don't get me wrong but there are people out there with a life outside of a game. Not everyone is level 200 and plays since 2018. It became a waste of ammo show. Everything I do is doing events and then running around farming lead. This isn't funny at all.
---
My bloodied deathclaw gauntlet with my usual build is still good. Only takes 1-2 punches to kill enemies. 
---
Exception being a sheesquatch/ miurlurk queen.
---
What did that event entail?
---
From what little I've gleaned it didn't really seem to have very strong Halloween vibes.
---
Rilly want them to do something a bit more trick or treat focused that involves us visiting each others camps.
---
Rilly hoping for a candy bucket dispenser that we can fill with treats for visitors.  But also with a 1 per person limiter, at least till they fast travel again. 
---
Gets old fast people emptying the drink dispensers in 1 go to steal a messily 15 caps for themselves. When it can take quite a bit of effort to keep them stocked with our preferred drinks.
---
Really? Why have we had absolutely no mention of Appalachia’s events with the 76ers except a reference to Vault 76 in the news on October 23rd, 2077 in Fallout 4? And how do you explain the presence of the Railway Rifle when the Railroad doesn’t exist yet?
---
Chances are high they'll make adjustments so if you really enjoy the game just chill. Take a break and keep an eye on updates. Otherwise its time to put some focus into an actual build that deals some damage. I'm sure many people here would be more than happy to help you sort out a decent build that requires a minimal amount of effort on your part. Even if they make the forest a safe spot are you really gonna be content just wandering around the same spot forever because you can't be bothered to put a focused build together after years of gameplay? Seems like at some point you would have at least a passing interest in tinkering with damage output.
---
Bruh I got a stroke and died trying to read that
---
For dealing with resilient daily have 2 on guns or one if bloody heavy with gauss mini.
---
I run the same as you do, not like "full sneak" but have perks for it. The various entrance ways made the hair trigger mod work very well on getting damage down range fast!
---
With how long they took planning theses ones I wouldn't count on them releasing more any time soon. Also there was no word on them releasing more, i hope they don't since I've spent used all my coins already and I had a fair amount lol
---
Logged off the game and logged back in and the quest was gone like it never started
---
Lack of will, resources or competence. If modders working outside the system can pull off a decent implementation, it should be easier to do it within the system. 
---
Also for a coder, it's not as sexy to work on than saying new story content.
---
If players want an “EZ mode loot farming Sim”, they should go play Warframe.
---
One Wasteland coming turned my good build into a great one. And I say that as a CAMP enthusiast who has never launched a nuke and as someone who has been to West-Tek once.
---
Viable rebreeders
---
Frenzy farm 76 😂
---
I mean it's not super clear where the boundaries are. I've been in them and suddenly out but not realize it. I've thought I was in what I thought was going to be the boost zone but I was literally maybe a step away (and still within the same room and it wasn't even a large room).
---
Certain daily ops aren't super clear where the next locations are.
---
These are new, and people are still learning.
---
Yup. Bomb drop event is the only thing still coming this year.
---
I launched one yesterday and had a bunch of people show up for a queen fight, but I did see one get thrown at Earle but the event never triggered?
---
Its Fallout 4 survival mode low level gameplay all over again. And i love it.
---
You mean the leftover bits and pieces? Or the ones that pass through and lodge in something more solid?
---
Most bullets are designed to deform and fracture to do the most internal damage.
---
Or the ones that are meant to tumble when they hit somethin, to try and turn your insides into a pinball table.
---
Basically most rounds get pretty mangled when shot.
---
Update: I was right. Steel dawn is not coming in the fall. It's official now. [https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/57zbNl1xvzWg8qOr9XjVN2/5124be8e293f1d22923f0aebca2837c6/Fallout76\_Year2\_General-Roadmap\_v3\_Horizontal-EN-07.jpg](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/57zbNl1xvzWg8qOr9XjVN2/5124be8e293f1d22923f0aebca2837c6/Fallout76_Year2_General-Roadmap_v3_Horizontal-EN-07.jpg)
---
The upside to all of these issues is by potentially fixing them, the game will have a much more stable line of code.
---
Since the calculation change and bug fixing I’ve noticed that the game actually runs a lot better, I’m getting massive FPS in areas I’d normally drop from 90 to 25 and I’m experiencing less crashing.
---
I’m hoping they get onto these issues as soon as possible though as it is quite a fundamental part of not only this Fallout, but any previous Fallout ever made IE: Stealth, VATS (Literally the most famous mechanic in Fallout), and of course any other underlying problem to do with the core game mechanic such as adrenaline. 
---
I’ve personally sent a ticket to Bethesda about it, I’m sure their PR teams have read about it on Reddit as well, I’ve gone to the extent of informing absolutely anyone who’s having problems VIA comments and have posted my own thread about it.
---
These stupid things fall from the sky everywhere I fast travel to.
---
If you have a friend that has it unlocked, they can always build it at your camp. Just like the wendigo colossus head statue.
---
Boohoo enemies take an extra bullet or two, so sad. I have no sympathy for people acting like them having to actually put in some effort to kill something now makes it a chore. Play an exploration sim if that's what you want, this is a post apocalyptic game. Shit tries to kill you and you have to fight back, that doesn't make it a chore lmfao.
---
That's not true 
---
After the uplinks are done you have to find and kill a small group of standard enemies before the boss will even show up
---
I just had one where there was one enemy stuck in the wall. Took like 3 minutes to dislodge it with grenades so that I could move on.
---
It’s all about speed. As long as you can avoid getting hit/heal yourself, just book it to every objective and don’t focus on enemies until you’re waiting for the bars to finish filling. Easy Paladin rank if alone, maybe Elder and near guaranteed Elder if not alone.
---
Well, you're making a LOT of assumptions here, but some of us like grinding for things.
---
Fast travel bug, 
---
Some things will never be patched out
---
With yesterday's I got no plan, so it happens it sucks but eh that's how she goes
---
Are you using Gunsmith Perk?   I always have at least level 3 equipped, except for heavy guns when I need to use stabilized.
---
PSN: Avalynch; will add you when I'm online next.
---
Currently not using headphones at the moment due to a ear infection. Looking for an alternative mic without any headphones as I do enjoy party chats.
---
I’ve noticed on the fallout 76 wiki for legendary perks there some listed like “botany buddy” that we don’t have. Later release I guess.
---
they could have gotten that way from the weight benches had people kept quiet about it.
---
Yeah really enjoyed it and also tonight’s one with the freezing mutants loads of action and a nice quick event, didn’t like the robot melee kill ones but - hey really appreciate the variety , hope they add new ones regularly
---
My bad it is the wrong sub lol,  but what did those abbreviations do to hurt you so much!?
---
God shutupshutupshutupshutupshutup please, enough of these “I’m quitting because the game changed” posts, please?
---
I ground through level 20 to 40 exclusively in one wasteland and it was not that hard. Killing enemies is a little slower, but then again the basically instant kill on most enemies beforehand was absurdly easy.
---
I like the update. Your math fails to account for the durability of the players to survive these attacks and how that scales with levels as well.
---
I don't know about builds most complaints I've seen is "I'm sneak bloodied and can't use it in ops"
---
But I disagree my main is a sneak bloodied build switches between bow, rifle, and commando and I do just fine. Its easy to swap out my 3 damage cards and then for ops I change sneak card for dodgy and toss on PA and shed half my rads or more and I do fine I solod yesterdays daily op first try. Its fun to adapt a little and have fun with it. I was upset at first then realized how boring daily op would be if i could sneak past everything stand next to both relays and then snipe the last wave off without taking damage.
---
As for the lower players I'd have to agree from what I'm seeing there was a great post that used game data to show how at 20-50 enemy health outpaced player damage.
---
Aren't there more perks in the PTS? I feel like some of the youtube vids had more perk options.
---
I'd like to see the Fallout 1&amp;2 version of the combat shotgun (the City-Killer 2000), along with the classic 10mm pistol, a "heavy" automatic weapon (a .308 assault rifle), and the DKS-501 sniper rifle. Ooh- and some new energy weapons too: namely the Wattz laser rifle &amp; pistol, and the plasma defender.
---
I think OP means like, I have a level 50 bloodied shotgun right, but I can somehow degrade it and make it a level 10 bloodied shotgun. So the level 10 could use it. 
---
But the whole point of being a low level is to experience everything yourself and die a few times here and there. 
---
Imagine being fresh out of the vault with High level weapons and armor.
---
Yes, please.
---
Haven’t got any rare rewards for all three days all elder tiers achieved. They say there’s 80% chance for a rare reward but idk about that seems glitched at least on my end.
---
Why isn’t 500 damage per hit sufficient for you?
---
Thank you but I've already done it
---
It's not a technical limitation. Being quite familiar with the creation engine I can safely say this would be very simple to implement.
---
On the flipside I'd just like for folks to be able to opt out of the level scaling. Blowing through hundreds of rounds cleaning up trash mobs gets tiresome very quickly.
---
And frankly, given with how much ammo I've had to craft these past two days compared to the last two weeks I pity the folks who don't have access to unlimited crafting storage.
---
unarmed bloodied builds are now dead sadly
---
If you mean 'Ace Full Assault Power armor' that is a skin for power armor. Its the name of the skin. Check fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Ace_(season)
---
I've had two crashes during daily ops but roaming around seems much smother after this patch
---
Definitely the 45 auto pistol / m1911. Even though I'm not a pistol build. Or a desert eagle, although the 10mm pistol looks kind of similar to that already. 
---
A repeating shotgun (m1887) or a bozar, maybe even the assault carbine / service rifle / m16 /m4. 
---
A Chinese LMG like the type 88 or the rpd would be also cool. 
---
But we definitely need more customization for the new guns that were introduced with fo76, like the 50cal machine gun, the 10mm smg or the LMG /MG42. We only have one skin for the 50cal,and none for the mg42. There's also an abundance of mods for them. 
---
For melee weapons of course the autoaxe would be neat.
---
Edit: I know the 10mm smg has been around for much longer,  I meant it wasn't a carryover from fallout 4.
---
Sorry that was my best attempt at it I had to reread and change  it a few times aswell 😂, hopefully someone better than me will be able to explain it easier
---
This is true but they nerfed damage to be assholes.. 
---
They call it balancing.. i call it being a dick nerfing every fucking bit of damage down the the bare minimum you need to do anything..
---
Great write up. I've been a bit amazed by how many people don't understand the reward chances
---
He was in power armor.
---
yeap, it's not possible to achieve a 1:1 cycle without unyielding.
---
and even with unyielding, you need both crit savvy 3 and a 15%v weapon. I think you may be able to do it with 31 luck and crit savvy 2 (assuming you're using a 15%v weapon) but I can't confirm it.
---
it's not possible with just unyielding and crit savvy 3. not even with 31 luck (shielded raider) or 32 I think. maybe with a full +luck armor set.
---
So I guess you are figuring out that it is more like a time attack and you should rush to the objectives and not focus on killing everything. The goal is to beat the time for the Elder rewards, which is 8 minutes. After the objective is done, you have 5 minutes to kill more enemies and loot bodies before it boots you out. What I do is loot and with about 30 seconds left, view the ops reports to see what I got.
---
Does it radiate players?
---
As long as there is a way to get the drops from the mischief event ill be happy missed last one .
---
Yep. Season 3 kickoff, Bombs Drop Event, New Guns and Armor, New Quests, Treasure Hunter Event, Holiday Scorched Event... all canceled. Damn that sucks!
---
That absolutely sucks. This is why I always make the team. Never join.  Not getting kicked out. And I never ever kick somebody out. If my gf or my friend wants to join, I just make a new one.
---
If I’m ceiling I had this happen before patch we found him bouncing back and forth. You gotta look up in the hole in the ceiling where the roof falls down and it will take a while but you gotta vats him and get him down. It only happened once on Xbox before patch to me and luckily we got him to die with a minute left. It sucks but hopefully if it ever happens again you can kill him this way.
---
Sticky worthy; granted, no one will read it when they ask anyways.
---
I can't one hit everything. The game is ruined!
---
I feel that. Got nothing two days in a row and it sucks (regardless of how fun the actual missions were).
---
I know the designers behind this game do not qualify as 'good'. if anything that's exactly what I've been pointing out since the beginning, that piercing gaze and resilient are lazy and poorly designed.
---
I can't imagine these would happen for a long time, if ever. Considering they don't even exist right now.
---
You get stuff like the ice box if you are under level 50.
---
Join the Scortched Earth event.  You get Repair kits for killing the queen.  Use these to only fix armor.  Saves a ton on Ballistic fiber.
---
I still have good damage and a bloodied explosive lever action with a optimized build but I’m just saying that I think a slight buff just to make rifleman a more viable alternative. Also keep in mind that this post was made post nerf
---
They have now come out and said its intentional. 
---
And I've got a level 392 junkies pa heavy gunner with a very optimised build. I find it more useful than a lot of the legendary perk cards
---
I mean what is a normal everyday build?  To be viable you need to build your character around a certain weapon type. That's just standard in these games.
---
You mean I have to try sometimes? Fuck this!
---
Those are still good numbers...
---
Exactly, they buffed enemy damage and resistance so why not perception too.
---
Won’t happen. It would cut into profits to bring in another group to just fix bugs.
---
Those people would be very far and few between. 
---
Most usually people who researched their ideal build well in advance with support sites.
---
I'm fine with someone who took the time to research things closely having a slight advantage over the majority of others who didn't. 
---
That being said, I do think the game needs a means to reset our legendary perks to zero so we can retrieve the perk coins to try out alternative builds. 
---
In the event that we just really wound up hating our choices. Is a real potential for someone to majorly hose their character by scrapping all their perk coins and investing them into the sub par legendaries that won5 compensate. 
---
Tho again if they researched in advance they'd have avoided those mistakes.
---
Doesn't mean too that I'm in the camp that thinks we should be allowed to reset our perks completely.
---
I actually do like how that system works, it goes with the games lore, that seeing that were lacking in a particular skill our characters train themselves to become proficient in other areas to the detriment of others. 
---
So long ad your not doing an insane 100% change of your stats for no good reason. With the legendary system tho it will take far longer to overcome bad choices.
---
You and me both -- left arm jetpack for life.
---
I got Burrows Signage and the plan for Vault Ninety-something's jumpsuit after yesterday's elder completion.  Rewards are all dumb luck.
---
Just the public events...the ones with the ! in the event icon. The harder the event, the more you get.
---
True, altho I think that balance is already in place tbh. Cuz I think ppl were a bit spoiled before who were casual and now they're bitchin cuz they might need to actually team up and use their mic and socialize some more. And then to make the game harder for more minmaxish stuff, we could always solo events and ops and bosses, or two-man it, etc... Regardless, there were prolly the same amount of ppl complaining prior to the patch each way. At least it brings something new and different to discuss, so as the communist colllectron would say... Uh.. Bring forth this dialectical movement to a higher... Synthesis of the game's player base, or whatev
---
 This would help me a lot. I have over 900 adventure mode levels and had  close to 0 perk points and perk packs. I wasted my perked points on  changing my specicals to use different Nuclear Winter builds.
---
It's supposed to be uncommon or rare, but I seriously got it the first 4 times I did the event in a row. I was beginning to think that it was broken.
---
Do the raider ending and be nice to the child. It’ll give you an option during the final mission to open a door, which holds the rifle. Anti armor, bonus crit and weightless.
---
No. Ps4.
---
Sneak has never really been a viable build for any assault-heavy events. I'm a semi-auto sneak build and I usually just throw on a set of power armor and take out a heavy weapon (executioner's gatling laser or two-shot gatling gun) for events like this. Even without the necessary perk cards, the DPS is respectable.
---
People saying they're "casuals" so they don't even invest in damage raising perks, asking the game to change because they dont wanna spec into damage.
---
I honestly liked the raids better. The amount of strategy needed to complete them on expert was intense and felt rewarding to succeed.  It had some problems like blue screening and doors not working but they could have easily removed the timer and made it so enemies have more resistances/damage and mutations like they do in the daily ops. Daily ops r fine but I do them solo without a problem since it just running from point to point and standing around. Vault raid had much more strategy and was the best end game content in my opinion, it was just too buggy, but they should have kept it and cleaned it up.
---
I had to pay for it, so should you
---
It’s a game have fun and if you don’t anymore go play something else. I recently switched my whole build around when I got a bloodied fixer from purveyor. It was cool doing over 2k damage for the month I got to but it’s more exciting now. I have ton of weapons and now i will actually use different ones instead of the normal three I used. Some nerfs prob where a little much but give feedback and maybe it will help them to calculate the right damage. It’s fun now, it’s fun to be on our toes every fight instead of wiping everything off the map.
---
They need to add the 9mm submarine gun and pistol and have it be they new .38 round, in terms of rarity
---
This has been a big wish for me for a while, single shot rifles like hunting rifle should have some crazy range when free aiming. Make scopes worth it.
---
He probably played basketball pre-war
---
500 damage is more than I’m doing with my unarmed build (I’m hitting for about 288 with a crit), nearly everything is down in 2-3 hits.  How is this a problem?
---
Because bloodied melee builds relied on 1 hitting to survive, the build combination (low health + melee) is fundamentally broken now, you can't survive after hitting something if it doesn't die because its going to turn around and smack you
---
I didn't play it but I kinda feel for people who invested in it.
---
I assume a lot of people are still working things out their way, after all if others are getting in the way of one persons play style there is always 1st available.
---
not good enough for a bloodied
---
Well, you now have an option to actually play all other build types, weapon and armour combinations and so on.
---
Never touched Bloodied, Junkie builds and this change had zero affect on me, One Wastelander also made enemies less of a nuance and more of an actual dangerous enemy.
---
p.s. I also purchased No Man's Sky on first day and still enjoying it since I haven't rode the hype train.
---
cancelling my fallout 1st tbh
---
no
---
Looks like a camp. Though not mine XD. But i think that that reflection is actually the place where they render all of the objects before they're added in the game.
---
I love it, with my current perk loadout I still crush most enemies with a VATS headshot.
---
Go for it.
---
There were different ones in the earlier pts that have now been removed
---
Nope, all the perk on the PTS are the same as what we currently have on live.
---
How is a game that is literally set around the holiday of Halloween not going to include a Halloween event?
---
I'm playing season 2 right now on my xbox.
---
This is the quality posting I come here for.
---
&gt; You don't need to get upset and leave
---
Who is doing this?
---
Let me introduce you to my Buddy
---
I got him in my 80s I think and over never found a better weapon
---
Did you download the update?...
---
Never used bloodied but have some in my stash. Just going around the wastes killing grilling and chilling. Solo Earl is not something that keeps me up all night.
---
I’ve been trying to get Elder as well, If you play on ps4 we can team up and try and get it
---
Luck 31, crit savy 2, and a 15% crit fill weapon will not get you a 1:1 cycle. With the 15% fill, You still need 34 luck and crit savy 2 or 24 luck and crit savy 3.
---
Id have to skip school if these were all rewards.
---
Here is a small addition to all the information already provided in this post. This is from the same dataminer (Gilpo) who originally dug up all the stuff about daily ops for us.
---
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y7YtULG-9k5u5GD6swiIwBVgxspA3Qg6IzLQpJqeNRQ/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y7YtULG-9k5u5GD6swiIwBVgxspA3Qg6IzLQpJqeNRQ/edit#gid=0)
---
What fun is it to kill lvl 5 scorched? I can absolutely understand the problems especially low lvl player have with this update, and it still needs a lot of balancing but in my opinion it goes to the right direction.
---
We need all the classes to be viable: Tank, DPS, and Heal (we only really have DPS). Some cc effects in the game would be nice also.
---
I have lower standards that the person you initially responded to, so I can tolerate it.
---
Robots sucked unless you had someone draining them down to hp and then someone else running around with a knife or a blade and finishing them off.  But the Blood Eagles and Super Mutants are so much fun!
---
Guess my wish came true with the PS5 pre order announcement and demon souls as a launch title haha. Perfect timing
---
Similar build for sure but different build items used. I wonder if its your base we stumbled upon, are you on xbox?  Thanks for sharing that video!
---
Ah, Thanks, now i can spend my coins without worry.
---
1st day I received the solar panal plan for elder, then last night I received the vault 94 jumpsuit, only ran it once a day but hit elder with a team of four 1st try each time, elder is meant to be an 80% chance of a rare reward but that still means 20% chance you don’t get the rare stuff so hopefully better luck next time, I guess it’s just RNG
---
Ah I'm on ps4... Cross platform playing would be awesome.
---
It's definitely up on xbox
---
I think you're right about the Armour Pen buddy, 
---
Recently I've actually been using my Ultracite Laser Rifle and it's doing wonderfully. 
---
I'm actually able to run-and-gun doing VATS headshots just eating up enemies like it should. 
---
And Plasma rifles now feel like they're doing exactly what they should. 
---
This is against Humanoids and Creatures, Robots on the other hand as expected have fairly good resistance to Energy damage.
---
Yep, I did that. Killed all the raiders harassing them, etc.
---
The game was fine before the update and nobody was complaining. Sorry for not having godtier weapons and builds
---
Um... it’s definitely available. Started Tuesday.
---
Never had issue getting agro from mobs, and I'm full health non-junkie heavy, so my damage is not that high, yet whole Colossal event any enemy in my vicinity is always on me, even if there's full team of bloodied people.
---
What is the repeatable dungeon called?
---
Someone just got upset at me in voice and left the Daily Op because I was going for the objective. Ended up finishing it with time to spare, despite only 1x capture rate.
---
You mean someone who isn’t used to having a challenge? Sorry easy mode was disabled.
---
Yall did the left arm.... disqusting. Right arm ftw.
---
Did 2 SE events last night back to back (Xbox one)  I think its a combo of people not wanting to hit the silo's but also people are farming the Daily Ops.
---
&gt;Yep. Season 3 kickoff, Bombs Drop Event, New Guns and Armor, New Quests, Treasure Hunter Event, Holiday Scorched Event...
---
Maybe 70-80% recycled content. New...? New probably. Umm... what new quest? Rehash. Rehash. Rehash.
---
Umm... Yeah bud. OK...
---
TY so much!  💜💜💜💜💜 If I could give you an award I would.  🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
---
i dont know, i have my xbox set to auto install updates and i wasn't prompted to install one when i launched the game and i was able to connect to the servers just fine, so i dont know what the problem is.
---
I try the walking around a bit. But, I also open the fast travel, wait......open the confirm, wait......then attempt it, and that seems to have decent success. Not perfect, but decent.
---
I've found that some people don't want to struggle. They want games to be easy and like things to be handed to then. They don't want to scrounge for supplies, they don't want to stop and think before they run into a building, they just want to annihilate.
---
I'm someone who plays for story (I hate FPS or any shooter really, so boring) and didn't like Wastelanders. I have grown to like it though and I died before anyways so it's not like much has changed 😂.
---
I'm level 160 something and even with only playing on weekends I still have a bunch of supplies. I don't worry about better guns or research anything. I use my Deathclaw Gauntlet primarily and my lever action rifle because I like it.
---
Campfire Tales was so chaotic and fun yesterday I can't wait to try some of those lower level events again!
---
Edit to say that I do agree that people can not like it. Not everything is for everyone so maybe you should go play something else or just give it a chance. Like it said I was mad at Wastelanders but now it's okay.
---
People acting like it's the end of the world need a better hobby.
---
Mutation serums go for upwards of 400 caps to a robot vendor.
---
All I know is my legacy E FFR laser rifle one shots most everything now but takes a huge hit to condition with each shot.
---
I've just finished watching all his videos about sneaking effects. Really impressive how little information is in the game, he had to do such an exhaustive process to validate all possible combinations. His amazing videos should be sent to Bethesda so they learn how to proper test their own game. 
---
Anyway, thanks for the tip bro, now I know that the shrouded wood set I'm using for months is utter garbage.
---
I've just been watching a video on ESO, never played it before or paid the game any attention but in this video they were showing off their home and adjusting things here and there that looked wrong.
---
The decorating system looks so good in that game, i wish we could just get that!
---
Yes there are many better guns than that. A crafted max level handmade would even be better since stalkers isn't very helpful
---
Shame they did. :(
---
I agree. One of the best parts is the ammo. I went in with 150 rounds of ammo for my lever action rifle and came out with 530 last night.
---
I'm a rifleman but i use to be able to two shot any yao guai, now it's more like 10 shots.
---
I got rare reward 3 times. One the first day and two yesterday. Got vault 94 plan twice for both hitting elder and got liquid courage recipe for hitting the second tier yesterday. So yeah there’s a chance I might not get anything the next ten times or maybe I will always who knows
---
For me, the three runs so far got me the Vault 94 stash box, BoS tac suit and Barrows signs
---
Just play through the story. I’m sure everything will sort itself out. 
---
Also check your pip boy to make sure no quests are disabled.
---
There is repair kits in atom shop 😉
---
Personally, I simply can't be arsed to trigger Scorched Earth or ACP because the rewards are just not good enough.
---
I've run the Queen twice since the patch and while my AA guns still do about the same damage as before the nerf it's just not fun anymore. The queen takes more bullets and her adds are no longer just in the way, they actually need to be dealt with.
---
Couple thousand rounds for a shit 1\*, some flux, UC Torso and Leg plans (lol, again) and a couple of repair kits. 
---
Scorched Earth wasn't very rewarding before the patch but now it's just insulting.
---
And Earle, well, how many Cursed weapons can the wasteland possibly need?
---
Well yeah, i have about 1000 hours of just grinding. Im not saying i dont enjoy the grind OR fallout. I just think they shouldnt release new armors so soon especially if theyre grind is just as long as the old one.
---
I'm just going by the Road Map that was put out today. Well, I was, before it all got canceled shortly after that.
---
You’d still complete it on *elder? (Edited)
---
Fellow sufferer here, also on XB1 👍
---
It’s a great addition, however, it is a little demoralizing to login run it once and beat it on elder, and get no fun rewards. Log off and wait till tomorrow.
---
I feel like there should ALWAYS be a tiny chance of getting a fun reward - Is play that mode all day. 
---
But we know that Bethesda likes hating everything so oh well.
---
I know, now horrible they fix exploits.
---
Take my downvote
---
I started a new character that is far from optimized with zero legendaries and just whatever armor I find laying around. I am having zero trouble. The additional challenge is fun. I don’t die very often, but I like the fact that I *can* die!
---
I was going to make a post almost the complete opposite of this but decided not to since the game is still broken. I’ve always wanted to run a pistol build but they sucked compared to my shotgun. I told myself after this patch I would make a pistol build MY WAY, without a specific guide. I did, and I’m having the most fun NOT one shotting everything for once. But I do understand that there are builds and weapons that just don’t work so I feel you.
---
Nah fallout 4 survival is just bullshitty , everything tanks alot, but not you
---
Thats not difficulty , its lazy design , difficulty would be if NPC's got the same drawbacks , but ammo would be hard to find , caps too , followers died for good , breaking limbs had an actual effect , you needed more than just stimpacks to heal completely , and enemies had any sign of inteligence
---
I can't see stats for xbox or Sony but you can on Steam and there are less and less players playing this each month.  Can't see this helping things out.  I really don't get Bethesda, or the deniers here that constantly say to those complaining about every poor choice Bethesda make, it's you! not them.  Eventually it will just be them left playing all by themselves.  LOL
---
Legacy ffr laser rifle? Legacy energy guns are explosive and with or without armor penetration, those guns are just broken powerful
---
They make a lot more by having you play long enough and grind enough levels to respec the other way and see things in the atom shop while playing ect
---
What!?
---
I play Fallout 76 around 2 hours per day max, as a heavy with 6 types of ammo, energy weapon is least used, I collect lead maybe once in two weeks in lucky mine. I haven't "farmed" steel in months.
---
On the main topic, normal full-health heavy (not bloodied, not junkie), the increase in ammo consumption is quite small, enjoyment of the process have increased though since enemies are not **Enemies** and not a distractions or annoyances
---
I did both arms but I think I messed up by putting it on both. I will take it off one and use the chest for something else and other arm. But I never did this with the other power armor so I thought I would be able to fly so awesome with both arms and chest. Oh boy was I wrong lol
---
My character is basically a Brahmin because of all my weight perks, but I’m still doing fine with enemies and I’ve soloed daily ops twice
---
I would love more CC and harder enemies, so we could really differentiate between tanks and DPS classes, then charismatic medics would be in much more need.
---
no, OP means the new armors shown in today's Road Map.
---
It is quite taxing on my OCD addled mind.
---
We're always watching :-)
---
As someone who stopped playing the game a while back because even at level 36 I was getting demolished anywhere outside the starting area...so far the update is doing the opposite of advertised.  They made it seem like it would make it easier to explore parts of the map you couldn't before since you'd get wrecked by high level enemies.  I just barely went into the edge of an area I haven't been yet (since I haven't been to like half the map because of previous said wrecking) and a level 36 mirelurk king (same level as me) like 2 hit killed me and my best weapons barely scratched it.  It makes no sense.  I thought this update would make the game actually playable without getting demolished by everything outside of the starting area.
---
The game became overly easy, people got away from relying on planning and tactics and just started bulldozing relying on stimpaks and ammo and high damage builds to see them through any situation.  Now they actually have to think and decide if fighting x number of y monsters  is worth the reward and embarrassment of death and people are not used to  that, yet.
---
Ghouls or at least some I know can have a lot of energy resistance .
---
White Knight is one of the best perks, combine it with Fix It Good 👌
---
So 1 run at Elder Tier is no different than when someone purposefully runs initiate, paladin, and elder seperately?
---
It's just like 6-7 minutes vs 20+ minutes.
---
You're still winding up with 3 rolls
---
I think we should wait until we know what they are, when they come out, and how long it takes to get them before we get pissed about what they are, when they come out, and how long it takes to get them.
---
Easier than before the patch, i havent even got a full build ready and just gut things like its nothing 😂
---
This is what I thought, it would be like a worse version of playing the base to enter the secret base.
---
I really hope people don't put their vendors inside the bunkers.
---
1000 caps each, and you can have mine.
---
nope.
---
If you are habing trouble with making repairs on youre weapons just grind out the queen a few dozen times. I have 56 improved repair kits that i use on everything from my t 65 to my gauss minigun
---
If I want to trigger the meet the overseer quest, do you know how to do that?
---
I’ll be on later tonight. Feel free to add; same name as on here. 
---
I’ve completed the storyline but don’t mind tagging along and play “bodyguard” with the whole One Wasteland going on.
---
People have used normal non legendary weapons to kill stuff after one wasteland, without issues.
---
I’ve found my melee build has definitely been hit with this update, doing maybe half or less of what I used to and feel like I’m taking more damage too
---
I wasn’t using any meta build or anything already felt like I wasn’t doing enough damage with melee before the update compared to what I see other people doing
---
Mostly the ones that benefit a player and cause no harm to others.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but they aren't designed to be "swapped."
---
Can get one, two sometimes in Lucky Hole Mine on one of the Cultists
---
I'm actually happy with the current system. It should cost you something to swap but isn't punishing to do so. You can swap 2 cards per level up. It's cheap.
---
No, it's a generator to power your camp
---
Something I'd really love are more power connectors. Specifically switches (the kind that work on both sides of a garage door without additional logic gates), buttons, timers, and logic gates.
---
This. I have tried a couple times, always solo and annoying as hell.
---
Deep down inside i hope they dont add a set of PA that is better than t 65. Fuck it. Even if they do just dont make it cost bullion do some ranking system bull with the BOS
---
I am on xbox but thanks for the offer! I keep getting in groups where either no one knows what to do or no one joins. I try to help with emotes but it does not seem to be enough
---
Your experience isn't universal though.  I'm a stealth melee build.  My whole run is based on sneak in kill sneak away lather rinse repeat.  If I get seen I get mobbed and don't have the armor/damage to survive that.
---
Harder I can deal with.  I'm unhappy because 60 levels of progression towards a specific tactical program is down the crapper.  They didn't even give me a respec.  Now I have to grind this guy for another 30 levels at things I don't like to do and am not good at, or drop him.  One point move per level and no perk card.  It will take months.
---
Move a point should stay.
---
Im with you on this one
---
Exactly. One run completing as Elder is enough if you only care about the new plans and rewards. But you can always farm the place for the repeatable rewards https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y7YtULG-9k5u5GD6swiIwBVgxspA3Qg6IzLQpJqeNRQ/htmlview?pru=AAABdMGEanQ*LtKHxcPVQQM_-RAwyDWiPg#gid=0
---
You're free to get a 10mm and a laser pistol with all perks and test this for yourself on a liberator . I believe those two guns have the same damage and liberators have 10 dr and 10 er.
---
Yes I think it's those ones that look like they're wearing metal armour, the Bloated looking sludge ones are good to go for blasting though!
---
The fix it good perk fixes armor to like 200%, no need for repair kits. 
---
Or just defeat the queen and get the improved ones for free
---
You don't need no special builds or super weapons. You just need to think a bit, before running in.
---
If there are multiple enemies, just cripple them. If you want to whack them in melee, don't run in yelling, but use stealth and VATS.
---
The game was idiotic easy and thankfully there is finally even a slight challenge and danger. Instead of playing a game where every player is like god, we now are bit more on NPC level.
---
I also have it on ps4 but I’m only level 13 as I bought it back when Redbox in US stopped renting games for 3 dollars. I wanted to try the game with the PlayStation community. But I mainly play on Xbox and yes I would love for cross play. Maybe just for consoles tho, so we don’t have 50 cals that shoot nukes if pc was also cross play lol
---
Go to a market sub
---
They better not come up with new ones,specially good ones. Or change the 2 coins value x scrap.
---
I've done it twice, Vault 94 jumpsuit &amp; Burrows signage. However, teammates have scored the new Power generator &amp; Sympto-matic. Lucky for me they are good friends and they look after the unlucky bugger with the junk rewards.
---
Where did you see the new road map?
---
Awesome, thank you!!!
---
You can place it in others camps, yes
---
Thanks man, I'll check it out!
---
The Glowing ones have a lot of energy resistance . Those charred ones I think you're talking about aren't so bad.
---
I run a bloodied vats commando build, pre rebalance I could we shot lvl 62 mutants with only 3 points in commando damage cards and o could one hit kill them with B/SS MMG. Now it takes 3-5 bullets depending on adrenaline and 2-3 swings of my MMG. 
---
I usually run around using either an assault rifle or combat rifle most of the time. With Q/33/25 on both and now it can take up to 7 shots to the head to kill a high ghee level super mutant. 
---
It is not really a problem. The enemies are still squishy enough to kill in seconds,
---
That's, uh, gotta be extremely annoying. I hope the issue gets resolved.
---
If you had to add tbh at the end, maybe you're not so h...?
---
This happened to me. I had my C.A.M.P. module placed on a concrete floor, some griefers blew it up with those meat lure bombs and my module ended up stuck underneath the ground. I couldn't find a way to get it out without replacing my camp and rebuilding. Dont place the module on anything that can be destroyed. Lesson learned.
---
Thank you for listening to our gripes. I've been frequently complaining since Tuesday, and it is out of character for me. Usually I'll just put a game down if I don't like it, because I know what's working for it is what others like about it. 
---
But Ive had a ton of fun with my wife playing 76 over the last two weeks and when she said she wanted to quit due to the intense leveling of monsters, my heart broke a little bit.
---
For me, it's clearly harder on my level 40 character but it's also a lot more fun. I'm pretty casual but I still like a good fight.
---
It's random, but it works fine I think. Out of the three ops so far I got two rare rewards: Vault 94 stash box and solar panel.
---
To make a last note or probable suggestion for those who definitely don't like the discussion. I am saying I don't want to be able to one shot a level 75 super mutant in the Divide but I don't want to cross paths with a level 100 mole rat in the forest either. I am not saying take away scaling all together. They could have level scaled the Savage Divide, the Bog and Fissure Prime areas for higher level players to farm more powerful enemies to get better xp and loot and left the rest of the map as it was. What do you think a Meat Week will be like with level 50 squirrels and possums? Think that one through. They could have even brought back "Survival" and did the scaling in a survival mode. I believe this would have made it more challenging for many who wanted it without taking away from the "free roam for fun" experience.
---
My advice to you (and many others) is that you learn the difference between the word "fix" and the word "change." 
---
Because One Wasteland is working as described and intended, and doesn't need to be "fixed."
---
That makes sense. From what I've witnessed since roughly February, this is the least toxic game community I've experienced. I feel like, and it's Bethesda so bear with me, that this would be an event specific feature or perk and/or a limitation of range for a taunted creatures travel. Or they get dragged out of the event perimeter and receive the same failure countdown threat as we do. But not really.
---
Interesting, I never got to try the raids just this activity
---
Yeah I know I'm talking about post Nerf too. My damage has decreased by half but I'm still one shotting everything like it's no issue. Like I said before there's a chance that your build is crap, like a food build or bloody. Bloody builds can never compete in pvp against a full health build ever since the PVP damage cap was put into effect. The most damage you can do to another player is 100, so if you're running a bloody build it doesn't matter how much damage you're out putting you're only going to do 100
---
Oh word nice. I will be online in about an hour if you want to link up?
---
Your suggestions would be relevant if Bethesda was willing to take big steps to address the complexity of balancing from both the enemy and player sides. But they clearly don't want to do that. They want a simple solution with One Wasteland, so bumping enemy stats is what they gave, and that's the type of solution I'd expect from most shooter style games because as I mentioned they typically don't offer a lot of strategic challenge. 
---
And you can disagree that enemies were a joke before, not everyone has the same approach to combat. In my experience as a person with a decent understanding of making a build and decent shooting abilities (meaning I'm not a god player)... it was brainlessly easy for the vast majority of the few hundred hours I played. 
---
As I said, bullet sponges aren't ideal, but shooter games are limited in terms of what you can expect from a combat encounter. I'd also be open to examples of Fallout mods that are built for persistent multiplayer shooter games with power scaling and jumps like this game has, but I suspect you won't be able to provide any.
---
No, you’d complete it on elder because the thing goes by quicker. From there you can kill the enemies you need to kill, then the boss.
---
It’s almost like the sub is made of 1000s of people with different opinions and they’re not all one giant hive mind 🙄
---
Stop running around with 10% HP. There's no way you didn't know that was going to be addressed, eventually.
---
Make sure that your armor is up to date too, that might be a reason. Also if you just ask some play would just give you "trash" legendaries, due to level, that would work better.
---
Seeing a lot of posts from us "older" folks (I'll be 50 very shortly and my partner in crime is in her late 60s) who just aren't enjoying any part of this.
---
I'm decent at FPS games. Hell, I used to play a LOT of Counter Strike when it was fun and new and while my reflexes have absolutely atrophied with the relentless march of time, I can still hold my own. But as I posted elsewhere, Bethesda keeps conflating "takes a long time to do" with "challenging" or "fun". Having to shoot 5-10x as many bullets to do the same thing, with a similar reward as before feels... bad. Even if it's technically more "challenging", it has do absolutely nothing to increase the fun.
---
I have a fairly well optimized stealth commando build and a nearly god tier weapon, so I'll be fine should I decide to play again (I finished season 1 and burnout plus the recent CAMP nerf removed any interest I had in playing). But my build or actual fully optimized meta builds with top-tier weapons should \*NOT\* be where Bethesda is catering to as acceptable level of difficulty.
---
It just ends up being another grind on top of all of the many existing, multi-tiered grinds that already exist in an insanely grindy game. It's just not fun.
---
I had to pay level ups for it.  You should too.
---
I was on SBQ today together with other 6 players. 
---
3 of them were 300+. 
---
After shredding half of of SBQ with JE Mini in 20-30 secs (yes, high damage bcz Magic) Ive stopped shooting. 
---
I dont know which perks &amp; weapons were in use of this gang, but during next 15 min they took only 10-12% of SBQ life🥴
---
Better they build camps
---
Better watch out saying you like the patch ppl down vote that shit. I’ve played since launch I switched my whole build around after getting a bloodied fixer last month from purveyor. I think the game is fun, I can’t speak on the low levels and how they’re dealing with it. But I’m actually going to try to use my beta character I made and see how it is. But it’s fun to have something new and challenging again.
---
I assume become level 20 or walk by her house, or listen to the overseer radio station in your pip boy
---
Seems easier.
---
Everything still dies in 1 shot, but how I get twice the XP.
---
For 200 bullion everyone around me gets +50% XP for half an hour every day.
---
Queen fights are under a minute.
---
I can put on power armor and assaultron beams now only tickle and I never run out of cores.
---
I can carry 10 more pounds if I visit my camp every half hour.
---
My camp now cures diseases.
---
I can click a button and go into a magical realm where mobs come to me and drop 10x the ammo I use to kill them.
---
I have 3 more Luck so suddenly I can have Serendipity and take 1/3 less damage.
---
Fire is doing about half as much damage to me.
---
Poison is doing about half as much damage to me.
---
Game became EASY MODE.
---
I did a solo on the vault 94 ops to see if I could figure it out. Talk about FUBAR. Aside from the fact I had no idea what I was doing or where I had to go, I guess I should be pleased with 24 mins. I spent so much time blowing through my 5mm ammo trying to kill Blood Eagles that I feared I would run out. Due to the fact that the enemy waves kept coming, it was difficult to even collect the dropped loot to replenish my supply. Didn't know I had to stay by the unlink. So, this information is gold.
---
Just built it in a friends camp
---
People downvote me because they fear how much they love me.
---
I haven’t even bother tried using the ammo converter after getting it and it NEVER worked for me, I give away my arrows and crossbow bolts now.
---
I thought people only used it as a repair kit farm these days
---
I managed to find the leg plans, I can pay for the helmet plans after spending 3 hours server hopping with no luck
---
Dude doesn't understand paragraphs, you think they'd understand nuance like that?
---
Also, booking from A to B implies you know where the hell you're supposed to go.
---
It doesn’t matter your gear.
---
It doesn’t matter your level.
---
The squad of bears will end you.
---
Awesome will have to have someone build one for me! Thanks!
---
Graham's seasonal community meat whack
---
Great, thank you!
---
Thats gonna eat your ap and fusion core
---
Just try. Take perk. Join team. Ask ur friend (which isnt in ur team) to shoot. You dead🥴
---
I love this new feature. Or bug. Idk. But it’s cool👍🏻
---
Im right there with you. I don't like min/max'ing at all. I just like wandering around and maybe killing a few ghouls or running into one high level creature and shitting myself as I run away.
---
Now it's all high level ghouls that I have to run away from because I'm as helpless at level 30 as I was at level 1.
---
I launched one last night on SBQ and someone with a hacked weapon killed her within 20 seconds. Then my friend launched on the mine and 2 different people with hacked weapons downed Earle in literally 3 seconds. No one else even got a shot in. We quit launching for that night. Imagine someone launches a nuke, 8 people show up and stand in the mine for 5 minutes and then you ruin it for everyone in 3 seconds because you have to show off your hacked weapons. Done launching nukes for a while
---
Could you specify or send a link to a pic because I really don't get it what yall mean with it then...
---
Goes to a post apocalyptic wasteland filled with monsters that wiped out The Brotherhood of Steel.  Complains about monsters not rolling over and dying when you look at them.
---
Aye. What they said. Loads of better options. Anti-armour is up there. Two shot explosive. Junkies. bloodied. 
---
Are you commando or rifleman? I may have a weapon you can have.
---
My weapons have been breaking as normal
---
At 280 i finally made the switch to commando, it was just before one wasteland came out. Judging by the reaction, rifleman is really bad now, i might have to test rifleman and shotgun builds out for myself to see if these complaints are as worthy as the posts make it out to be.
---
Yee I forgot about the pesky glowing ones, though that's to be expected since they are pretty darn radiated.
---
Really enjoying being able to use my Laser Rifle now though, before the Update the Ultracite Laser Rifle especially was just incredibly horrible to use, like it literally did next to nothing but now, now it feels like that slight less amount of damage for faster fire rate is an exceptional choice over the standard Laser Rifles (However, that's for Rifleman of course, if using commando you'd want a normal Laser Rifle as I'm fairly certain that the Ultracite one gains no increased fire rate with Automatic Barrel, only single shot Barrels).
---
23rd
---
Idk man... it was a little shocking to see my b25 fixer go from 330 to 168 in 24hr 
---
Of the bss moleminer gauntlet go from 780 to 360...
---
What was wrong with how it was? To me, it was enjoyable going in to the bog to fight high level stuff (I still died plenty) then go wander the forest just to kill low level things. Takes away some of the fun when every enemy is high always. More of a challenge? Eh I got that going to the no no red zone. This patch is great besides the enemy scaling. It just needs to go.
---
Yes exactly!
---
I hate shooters really, I find them boring, but I also get bored if everything's easy.
---
It's why I liked Borderlands so much, the enemies scaled with you so even if you were playing through for the 5th time it still wasn't super easy.
---
The BOS collectron is so lame and boring...
---
Sounds like you need to invest in blocker and serendipity. I haven’t had issues with the nerf as a full Bloodied. I barely get any damage taken with no buffs. Just the right perk cards and mutations. There’s ways to be as tanky as the enemies can be. Just need to learn what to do and not complain about it. You adapt and strive or you die multiple times and quit the game because it’s too hard. Good luck man.
---
Can't really say, I'm pretty much just hoping on, doing a few ops and logging, but I have seen a few nukes drop, both queen and earl.
---
Ugh OK, that sucks.  I don't have a lot of the old ones still.  Thanks.
---
I think more people on this sub knowingly use exploit weapons than they want to admit.
---
They can be done solo so having 1 person on them is fine...
---
sooo cheap and generous!!
---
I beg to differ. First bear I two shot, then gun fu and adrenaline kicks in and I one tap the rest.
---
That’s what Serendipity is for. And a set of Sentinel/Cavalier Armor. And Dodgy.  And Blocker, etc. 
---
Bloodied builds can be very tanky.  They didn’t have to be glass cannons. They can have very good survivability.
---
If a Bloodied player focuses only on maximizing their damage output, then they’re going to have a bad time.
---
I would pay $100.00 for a bundle that contained all of those items.
---
I had to sneak past to get my picture. Three level 100 yaos were fighting about 10 level 60 glowing radstags.
---
Fuck that.
---
Killed the Xbox base to, unless everyone is still downloading that insane patch then.. the servers are empty!
---
Yeah.  I get it, but also its been up for two days.  I have, literally, ran one DO.  Most people haven't run it all.  It's going to be a shit show for a few weeks with randoms.
---
You're not wrong... It almost sounds like he's sabotaging his own build and then complaining about it. Commie wacker? Broadsider? Lol c'mon bud these were never viable weapons.
---
What ai really want is to be able to link spotify/imusic to my pipboy radio
---
I read a lot of weird shit that happens on the PC servers. Just Ps4 and Xbox would be great for me.
---
I survive just fine with my bloodied unarmed.   
---
Yea it’s taking 2-3 swings now, but my survivability is just fine.
---
Yeah im on pc when I got on today thought I was on a private server there were only few camps and no public teams its really weird
---
I've seen more people than ever.
---
Then re-evaluate your damage mitigation/avoidance/reduction/recovery choices.  Because that’s plenty of damage to take out a boss enemy in a few seconds, and still one or two shot most non-boss mobs.
---
Xbox seems the same, iv hopped about 10 times today and there only seems to be a small handful on each world.
---
The Thing with this update for me.. I love to hate bu i also hate to love it... Mening there is some Thing good and some Thing bad..
---
The good thing:
---
Much more difficult
---
Bad:
---
To dufficult. I use WAY more ammonthan i would like to use. And since i refuse to buy ammo at overprice. I have to farm it. That is VERY diffivult when you have to use ammo many places.
---
80% chance an yet I don't have a single rare reward. Hmm..
---
It’ll get reworked with an upcoming season probably. Maybe with enclave or BoS?
---
I got that new generator and its big as truck. Its providing same amout of electr. as fusion generator so no thanks.
---
Handmade max level is 45. Youll want the better receiver mods if you dont have them. Youll need the handmade plan to craft and scrap a lot of them to unlock the mods. For the most damage Hardened for semi auto, and i forget the auto one. Suppressor to stay in stealth is handy too.
---
Uh I'd be happy mate.. ive got top rank every time an yet to even get a single rare reward.
---
This makes me think about how I used to believe what they told me, like in late 2019 when I was telling my friends "perk loadouts are coming 1st quarter 2020!" Lol
---
Anyway, does this mean "uplink" is the only daily op until sometime next year?
---
I mean at least you got new content, i got a damn ice box plan and that my friend is a slap in the face
---
High level enemies will follow you anyways.
---
Reddit is against anyone being negative to the game, don't bother tbh.
---
I'm ngl I see what you mean, coughing up a lot of stuff for your perfect weapon. Having the most fun, feeling like James bond. Now our weapons do jack and it's really not as fun as it was before.
---
Stop saying that. Every time People post on here with something like that someone comes out and says “go to a market sub”. Those subs are extremely saturated to where lots of posts don’t even get seen and on top of that most posts are about weapon trades or armor trades. If you don’t like the post or don’t think it belongs just keep scrolling.
---
The perception boost is not permanent. Each of the Daily Ops circulates its primary mutation (Melee kills only, exploding, freezing attacks) daily, while i believe the secondary (Sneak Proof) will change once a week. Makes sense with the grindiness of the game. Theres a list of all the mutations and boosts that they randomly pool from. 
---
And I feel your pain. My alt is a chameleon, no armor berserker sniper. So i can't even step into the Ops without my ass getting wrapped up nicely for me. But thats the beauty of the game. Grind some events, change your special and perks, and build a better mouse to take on the mousetrap.
---
Cool ty I will send a request!
---
Oh that roadmap. I was talking about that score roadmap XD. Anyhow I assume that those would be something like modified T60 and T51B sets because the BoS doesn't really have very improvised stuff compared to what they had before war. Their motto is to 'salvage pre-war technology' and not create new armors like the enclave sort of did with the X01 series.
---
Finally...
---
True , it was a joke 😁
---
Level 23 is probably a bit low for Roses Quests.
---
Here are some ideas
---
As for Ammo on all my characters I spec into strength to start with and use Melee weapons,you can always switch out the perks to your desired build later.
---
See if anyone wants to run the quests with you .
---
Do lots of events you can tag stuff and get lots of XP without killing it.
---
Play Smart!
---
You need to see IT Crowd. It's on Netflix.
---
I'm rifleman at the moment. Debating to go to shotgun.
---
Im not mad or upset about the grind. Just nervous about the armor itself.
---
I'm suspicious that there was a bug that reduced wear and they fixed it.  There was a few months there where I basically didn't have to repair anything.  It seems like I have to repair stuff at about the rate that I used to last year.
---
Agreed, my sniper has been needing a reason to snipe
---
Yes please, RANGE and damage, I want to make a sneaky sniper so bad but it's futile with the new patch, very sad.
---
Level 144 and played for the first time in about a month.  Did not like my experience today.  In the past i could go to low level areas to scavenge the stuff that i needed.  Now every enemy in the low level areas is level 50.  Whitespring has now level 100 enemies.  My weapons break and my bullets go way faster than i can get new resources.  Very dissapointed and will probably stop the game . I still had most of the quests to play but now this has become impossible with the damage buffs and enemy boost.
---
the other day my group was just constant death and respawn to those robots. We finally had everyone shooting and one person in there melee whacking the ones close to death.
---
Ok. Deleted post.
---
Treat this game like a tactical shooter with heavy resource management &amp; less run &amp; gun shooter.
---
Work on your build, don't take on more than a few enemies at a time, have alt weapons that use different ammo to spread the load, use melee a lot more for "easier" stuff, use more utility weapons like grenades for clusters of enemies.
---
I'm currently play a level 15. Harder than it was before but total manageable.
---
Yeah, me too. If that's what they want, then it isn't a Fallout game anymore.
---
If they add more in the future, then they should also allow us to recycle our existing legendary perk cards, so we can get our invested perk coins back.
---
It's entirely possible it's not PA at all, you know.
---
Yeah man, I got on early this morning did the daily. Figured I'd wait to see if anyone got on to run ops an after over an hour litterally nobody joined so I solod it. Went an ate breakfast came back and just kept getting the same world with only 7 people on it.
---
That's awesome.
---
That's the thing about Fallout 3, Diablo, etc. *Easy mode is an option.*
---
Bethesda took that option away from Fallout 76, even though many were enjoying it. And there are other ways to implement this kind of challenge without forcing it on existing players.
---
What is your dr reading from your pip boy when you are in your pa and about to start combat?
---
Not cool dude :( 😂
---
I don’t do pve ok? and my build is not crap this is just my opinion on game balance
---
On PC? Interesting..
---
I wish Crit'ing with melee wasn't so awkward...
---
 We had a Osmosis kit. Had. It's gone now. Stolen.
---
I think one of the issues is that there is a learning curve to the game.  I struggled at levels 20-35 or so when I started over a year ago.  I hit a point where I wasn’t doing enough damage.  Always out of ammo.  And my weapons/armor kept breaking to the point that I would literally do a run for screws to fix a weapon.  Have armor break.  So do a run for ballistic fiber.  And run out of ammo.  Then do a run for lead.  And weapon breaks.  Repeat.  
---
Thanks to Reddit here back then. Some people looked at my build and made suggestions and after a few levels things got much easier.  
---
For you.  You are playing new but with the learning curve solved.  
---
If anything I think the learning curve issue just still exists.  Game almost needs a set of tutorial reminders mid-game —- Like clippy
---
“Hey, Ran out of ammo? Consider getting Ammosmith and super duper!  You can just equip them when crafting.”
---
“I see your weapon broke again.  You should keep Gunsmith equipped at all times”
---
“You don’t seem to be leveling very fast.  Increasing your INT will help with that!”
---
Yeah. I wish they put in the time to clean up the raids so everyone could experience them. Daily ops are still a nice addition but definitely not a replacement
---
Explosive and faster fire rate are both secondary traits which means they are mutually exclusive.
---
Must be your region. Felt pretty normal for me
---
And the repair kits are not even Improved kits!? 🤔
---
I'd like if it scales to your level to the previous max of the zone, with the possibility of opting in for continuing to scale EVERYTHING to your level for the people who want it 
---
Low levels can still wander the map and have everything scale down while they do the Wastelanders questline, I and other casual players can continue enjoying only having to ~~fight off~~ punt level 20 things in the Forest area, and Hardmode Players can enjoy their all level 100 Super Mutants in West Tek
---
Post build pard
---
I leveled up a new character recently (before the patch) and it was still a pain (i was rushing to hit 50) and now, the more you level up the enemies will be even more of a pain. 
---
but tips I can offer 
---
-Public events to level up.
---
-pick and use the right perks for increase damage and survivability.
---
-do daily and side quests.
---
-cook food and use other healing items and save stimpak only when you have to in combat.
---
-try to find some fusion core and use power armor. 
---
-try to find a group or get in public group.
---
Suggested this before, i think to help balance damage certain weapons should have increased weakspot multipliers. For example 
---
**- Supressable Slow rifles:** (lever, hunting, pipe revolver)l: 3x multiplier so now headshots/weakspots do 3x damage instead of 2x
---
**- semi auto rifle receivers:** ( fixer, handmade, etc): 2.5x multiplier
---
**-  semi auto pistols,  semi auto laser weapons :**  3.5x multiplier for pistols since their base damage is very low (approx 2/3 a handmade), this would help close the gap. Laser weapons cannot be suppressed, this help offset them aswell.
---
**- Auto pistols and auto lasers:**  3x multplier, again makes up for pistols very low base damage, and lasers not able to be supressed
---
**- Revolvers:** (ones that cant be supressed): 4x multiplier.  This is to make up for the lack of stealth. Stealth especially now with follow through is a massive advantage over non stealth builds using the same weapons.
---
This benefits all builds that use these weapons. It helps bridge the performance gap with auto rifles, while at the same time isnt incredibly OP because you have to be accurate in order to take advantage of it.
---
Thanks for the tip.  I have only done it  a few times, but I didn't realize you needed to be right up on it.
---
Kinda always did.  I've lost with 3 legendary wolves coming in and pretty much instantly wiping them out before.  If you can't jetpack up and 1 shot them, they'll get behind the brahmin and you're screwed.
---
Frankly, Bloodied Commando is still pretty much "easy mode" as far as I'm concerned.  The only difference is really the bullet expenditure in a few cases.
---
Actually not [https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340#7d](https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340#7d)
---
When you say "reset," what do you mean?
---
As because the way it used to be was they would spawn based on the highest level person and the event, sometimes when it work as intended. Then sometimes they would bug out and nothing would spawn but oh well.
---
My apologies, at work on very little sleep, meant to say elder in the first place
---
People don't learn
---
Why not go and get fully mutated then remove the rads with Brahmin milk or the nuke cola that removes rads .. on my last character I was fully mutated at level 2..
---
Im shotty build..i like to get up close personal.i give them a kiss before i blow their head off.lol.
---
You cannot equip both. Only one copy of any perk can be equipped at any time. You can however rank up animated ones with non animated ones. As others have said the problem is likely just that bandolier only has 2 ranks.
---
C’mon, being able to bypass the entire quest just because you knew of an exploit does harm others,  it might be minor, but you can’t say that being able to earn treasury notes, scrip, experience, and other rewards as small as they may be, doesn’t have an impact on the game as a whole when other players have to expend resources to do the same thing. 
---
If you want to exploit the fuck out of a game, go play an offline, single player game.
---
I am now. I swapped things around today and added it. I've yet to see the difference it makes..
---
You can get godroll armor and a weapon for like 5$ on eBay quit complaining.
---
Before the update they used to be level 5, I believe. Now they’re level 50 (for me).
---
sigh, guess this counters my double bonus award on yesterdays op
---
Ahh. Lol
---
I've literally saw posts, or talked to people in game that thought you had to have repair kits, and were unaware that workbench repair was still an option.
---
There is a post about damage scaling with Patch 22 that suggests you're on to something. But, if you're still up for it, try teaming up with people and do lots and lots of events, hopefully ones with a chance for legendary weapons. Find a decent shotgun that has a magic effect, for more info check out Angry Turtle's videos on magic weapons. But, any one of the following effects should work:
---
* Instigating, Junkie's, or Stalker's
---
* (major effect) +40% Bash, +33% VATS, or +50% Limb
---
But you would want to use vats, concentrated fire is *not* necessary.
---
Then get a set of level 25 Power Armor and/or do the questline to get the Excavator Power Armor. One major benefit for Power Armor is a hidden damage reduction of 42% which is in addition to the resistances the PA provides.
---
Check player vendors for the Fancy Pump Shotgun. It is Anti-Armor and has the extra limb damage which does extra damage (magic) in VATS. You can try to farm it yourself by collecting and turning in Pleasant Valley Claim Tickets to the Bellhop bot.
---
Also, if you do a bunch of events and kill lots of animals and harvest their meat, cook *everything* and make soups too. For particularly difficult areas, try taking one of everything. The resulting boost to your HP and AP is usually quite noticeable.
---
Good luck out there in Appalachia!
---
I don't consider it a "nerf". It's an adjustment to the baseline damage calculations in order to facilitate easier balancing in the future.
---
Yup, easy mode.  I have the base cards and it's enough to take it from dying before you can stimpack to having plenty of time to holster your gauss and get some healing off.
---
Here is a crazy thought you are not a newbie and thus already understand the game and can not give a accurate reflection of what a newbie would experience right now.
---
Hug gladly accepted.  I don't understand why anyone would play a game if not to have fun, it's all so foreign to me!  Just gotta do what you enjoy and ignore the haters.
---
Until people find a way to make him naked like every other camp I show up to 😂
---
You can't.
---
God the shotguns in the game disappoint me on a spiritual level.
---
The swinging range of the barrel is longer than the effective range of the damn gun. It's a 20lb melee weapon that uses ammo. Why.
---
Same with pistols, what kind of niche are they supposed to fill really? They just suck more because they're more lighter? I don't know, man.
---
I miss the old raid still. Except for the 2nd week raid. Fuck that one. But the other 2 were good, I was even building a set of trapper exterminator sentinel for it lmao
---
This bug has been around for a good while now.
---
I understand what you're trying to say and I'm telling you that it doesn't make sense to let you wear the backpack inside the power armor. Power armor has a lot of auxiliary benefits that you can't get from wearing regular armor even if you combine it with a backpack.  I do think that giving power armor users access to the same functionality that backpacks provide to non power armor users through mods would be an effective way to accomplish exactly what you want but still make sense.
---
Imo this update is awesome and definitely a move in the right direction. Now just fix vats and health rubberbanding, Earl falling through the floor, stuff like that...
---
I apologize I'm not quite sure what you mean by build reset.
---
Doesn't look like you're working to me.
---
lol :) It just works, right?
---
I am super excited to see where daily ops goes. I am loving it right now
---
Correct
---
I mean maybe de-level the perks and get coins back

I never bought into the bloodied builds, I recently (last few levels of season one) converted to commando and quite enjoyed it, and there’s not much difference to my playing except I get higher level weapons to sell and more XP. I’m very happy with it. This update has been a really good improvement in the whole. So glad that fast travel is free to crater/foundation. There’s a lot of QoL improvements that are really refreshing. It feels like 76.2
---
Essentially there is a bunch of stuff they seem to throw at you with 0 information. Maybe I'm just a sucker and bought the guides for 3 and 4, so I knew what I wanted before I leveled up. Focusing on your build, and your place on the map. You can farm a few levels at weaker locations in the area around the vault for a few levels before you try harder quests. I'd also look at ways to make caps. If you take a full inventory of weapons to a train station vendor, you can make a few hundred. Buy ammo from other players as its always cheaper. The community comes together a bunch, so if you see other players you should ask them to join a team, the "follow me" emote should be a hint to get them to fast travel to you to help you. I use it and people get it 60% of the time?
---
E: Happy to craft you anything you need, share a few stims or rad away. Won't break the game for you, but can get you a start.
---
Yeah, I think the majority of players loved farming quick events,  didn't you too? 
---
You got a point "if every event provided loot proportional to the amount of effort and resources you put into it you probably wouldn't feel so bad about it".
---
The problem is we all waste more ammo, weapon and armor condition and correct me if I'm wrong, (I've done just 7 events since the update) but the rewards are still the same as before, I've killed level 100 3* legendaries mole miners and got a 1*nocturnal leather RA, just to give you an example.
---
So I went ahead and did Melee and I’m liking it a lot.Just one question though. I’m using   vats to hit dodgy types and sometimes for reasons I can’t figure out my character just freezes and won’t hit no matter what I do with the trigger. Do you know what that would be?
---
True but you don't really see BoS members wearing that sort of special armor in previous fallout titles. Though it could be possible. But i expect PA.
---
You’re the exception. Most of us don’t get that lucky, especially when they catch you right when you fast travel to your camp and instantly swarm you.
---
Perk loadouts should not be hard for them to do, there is a mod that already accomplished this that should be a good model for them to base their changes on.
---
Thank you!
---
I do not understand the incredible amount of moaning going on. I love the update. I started a new character that is far from optimized, and it is fun. It is challenging, but I do not die all the time, so it is not too hard.
---
Well they must be logged in different regions because NA is dead AF right now.
---
If they did, you’d get back like... 1/4th the perk coins. I leveled up far flung fireworks and it’s ass so... RIP me
---
Oh I’ve noticed so I’m going to take it off chest and one arm. Because I couldn’t fly but for one second before drained even with 15 agility
---
How about instead of a free build reset or new atomic shop items or new legendary run or new enemies, they fix the crap that needs addressing like critical errors or vendor bots not responding or fast travels not working or black screens or enemies that run around that you cant kill. How about we fix the stuff that needs fixing and stop worrying about the add on stuff, thats an idea.
---
Every now and then I will cosplay as a Raider/Blood Eagle.  Currently I am wearing my Witches costume and hat while my Haunted House is up and running.  Most of the time I try to wear my rare outfits and masks but I switch up my outfits so often its hard to say what my style really is.  One day I am a Firebreather, the next I am Mr Fuzzy lol.
---
Quick guys, he isn’t joining our circlejerk, downvote! /s
---
Yeah I have both.
---
is it really? I have it too. Does jt not stack up with explosive expert?
---
Not every enemy is like a deathclaw, come on! This is dramatic and exaggerated. Be honest, how many times have you really died since One Wasteland?
---
I’ve hit Elder tier a handful of times so far and haven’t gotten a single rare Rare reward drop. Wack.
---
Have you tried fallout shelter ?
---
That is so stupid idea and design. I love everything in this game, especially last update, but making literally unforgiving choices without ability to change - meh
---
That makes absolutely no sense though, at least for this year. They’ll spawn all over the map and not just the ash heap, they’ll be max level for max level legendaries, and they’ll have tons of new and unique plans. Everyone loved Santa scorched, and this will be way better than the Santa scorched event, because of the max level legendaries and the new plans
---
You don’t.
---
Done with this game. I definitely want to spend all my fucking time wasting ammo on these daily Ops and having to defeat 17 level 50 rad roaches
---
Right here. People think you just can’t play casually anymore. Yes. You. Can. Bunch of whiny babies I swear.
---
You're way oversimplifying the concerns.
---
I don't fucking care that I have to work harder to beat an enemy - what I hate is that EVERY enemy is taking 10-15 rounds to put down.  Again, that  wouldn't be a big deal if I saw actual leveled drops from those enemies particularly 5.56, the ammo I'm using.  But instead I drown in .308 and machetes.
---
So right now, with a not perfectly optimized auto rifle character that hasn't yet gotten a good legendary drop, I'm spending 60% of my time farming resources, and getting less of a net gain on a resource run.  Yes I have the new ammo perk, yes I'm specced for making the ammo.   The balance is off if you're not min/ maxing this game.
---
The game went from a fun relaxing distraction to stress inducing.  I don't need the game to be easier - just better balanced for casual players.
---
I could definitely go for a higher scrip limit as well, I don’t think it would hurt anything, I also want the vendor cap limit at 1500 instead of 1400 so I could sell 3 mutations and be done with it.
---
I've noticed this too on my AAplasma caster, its been rocking
---
Magnificent! These are great ideas, and Would love to see these!
---
Sounds awesome to me !
---
Do you know what level do u need to be? because i already knew of this place but they only had tube guns, but when i went with my lvl 60 character i was able to get some gatling guns.
---
Nah they would rather cry because their raggedy build isn’t one shotting everything anymore.
---
i’m enjoying the update. i play solo on a private server and have a heavy build and it’s nice using some of my heavy weapons that i never felt i had to use for most areas. i have so much ammo and stim packs that have just been sitting in my stash box that i can actually use.
---
i do see how casual players would struggle..maybe make a passive mode or something for them so they can just focus on building camp or whatever. me personally don’t understand delving into any rpg for a casual experience. especially fallout. they were always difficult games with a variety of enemies who could kick your ass if you weren’t properly prepared. 76 just feels like fallout again. hopefully they don’t change too much in the future. daily ops is rewarding and fun and hope they expand to that if anything.
---
I was following the Lady of Death guide. Level 35. It was fine 2 days ago.
---
I'll have to try out my melee character or something tonight. So far I've only played my Heavy Gunner and the closest thing I've noticed to difficulty is an extra 2-3 rounds to kill most things.
---
And Resilient robots, but that was just Dodgy eating all my AP when I wanted to bash.
---
Or it could be used to just make lots of Brahmin. Think about all of the milking you could do.
---
100% agree it was waaaay to easy to be god mode.
---
I finally have good challenges.it gets soooo boring being able to kill anything with one shot.with the legendary perks i was able to balance everything out just right for my build.
---
That is a really good way to look at it.
---
What I mean is, the new armor could be separate from Steel Dawn. We don't know yet.
---
I used at least 50% of my level ups playing with my build.
---
He tags enemies, you do all the lifting.
---
Level 1-50 isn't easy for new players.  He simply won't know strategy and tactics to circumvent difficulty and ammo issues in place now.
---
Bad time to be a new player.
---
Fortunately the scaling makes xp gain easy but ammo is up and stim use is up.
---
Make him go melee
---
oh yeah that's never gonna happen.
---
I'm convinced the gunsmith perk has been broken for months now.
---
I don't believe they had a set time frame for perk loadouts until a few months ago. They merely said it's on their radar. Wastelanders was delayed by about 7 months though. Legendary perks were originally intended for the wastelanders launch a year or so ago, but they got pushed to now...maybe that's the most delayed feature so far
---
Where did you see the new calendar?
---
Yep. You can still play casually, you can still run lazy food builds people are just dumb and think that because they can’t one shot enemies with their pipe guns anymore the game is trash. Those people just need to leave the game. More room for players like us that love fallout and a fun challenge.
---
Would you care to elaborate?
---
I first noticed the texture on a vampires assaultron blade before I checked the gutter, it’s the same texture for all of them.
---
The enemies in the op dailies actually drop the ammo for the weapon you are killing them with.brilliant!
---
Dude your talking PVP he’s talking PVE.
---
Actually that's not a bad idea
---
neither have I
---
the question was rhetorical 
---
 and this new patch sucks ass 
---
I'm all ready low on ammo 
---
and I carry about  1000k each  for my guns
---
I have some guns sitting there. I can give you one for free and mod it. Pretty sure they'll be better than your stalkers. 
---
Your choices are
---
Furious handmade +10% damage while aiming 
---
Instigating Handmade +10% damage while aiming 
---
Furious Lever action +10% damage while aiming 
---
Furious Lever 50% Vats Crit damage 90% reduced weight (if you have a lot of luck perks for crits this might be the one for you)
---
Nice work. I always noticed on each of my 5 characters hitting around the 20-30 mark (around the time you start getting to savage divide), the difficulty seemed to scale alot more felt normal.
---
Minimal level is a lvl 20. I can make one of you want to. (Im on pc)
---
I just wish i had some better weapons. But this is what i get for being casual about it 😅
---
Should try using a legacy laser rifle. Something like 30-36 shots before breaking right now. And that's with it repaired to 200%.
---
Just grind out 20+ levels. Pretty simple. /s
---
It does as far as I remember, but I just feel like even then it’s low damage to take up a legendary perk slot I could be using, plus I have enough explosions going on already, don’t need more lol.
---
Level 50 is less than 7 days concerted effort. Supply your friend ammo. Join a public team with event XP bonus. Enable Inspirational perk if you can. Consume XP booting food. Run Path to Enlightenment when available. Keep at it and have fun :)
---
The Turtle says 100.
---
I think they were expecting people to pay attention to what they were doing.
---
And my axxxxx!
---
Sorry for the lotr ref but ill gladly assist so we have a full team: egroegy
---
I'm sorry. Mischief night was way better. If we're just basing this on the new calander, I'm hoping it was just something they accidentally left out, like the healing effect on the legendary perk for power armor.
---
I’d like to see this implemented
---
This sacrifice is no lamp. But it will do.
---
A shit post flair would be more accurate.
---
A broadcast will appear at level 20 to meet the overseer
---
Not to mention other long-standing bugs that exacerbate the damage that can be done by rando enemies. For example my change to last weapon button does not work with gold bullion weapons. I die flipping through my inventory.
---
Well, here it wasn't. And for a very, very long time at that.
---
I can understand casual players who were not at all prepared for this.
---
It was Abby's bunker. after I unequipped fast traveled away and came back, it gave me the hack prompt and screen. hacked it and got the daily. 
---
Not sure, maybe just an isolated screw up for me.
---
76 is still tame with monetization compared to ESO
---
I have 4 lvl of this skill. Sound like wasting a lot of time.
---
Stupid game design(
---
*Do you even lift, bro!?*
---
GET 'EM OUT BOYS, HE DID IT!
---
beefytrout 2020
---
Yeah that wouldn’t make sense. Especially with the one wasteland update. That would just make low levels deal more damage than high levels which makes no sense.
---
I wonder what kind of ''powerful'' enemies they will add to the other mode to challenge PA, since now they can be basically immune to energy attacks, poison damage and explosion/fire damage. 
---
Maybe enemies with armor-ignoring ballistic damage(think of those Gutsies on steroids) or enemies that deal a % of max health per hit or something.
---
The clippy idea... You may be on to something. Name it Pippy the Pipboy or something.
---
Non-bloodied/junkie Rifleman on seems like the bottom of the damage output of all possible builds. Commando is practically a Rifleman multiplied by ammo capacity.
---
Brother just scrapped all Rifleman related perk cards because they are a no-go for just playing normally without really struggling, and he played it for more than a year since day 1, he likes it very much, but it was just killing all of his enjoyment.
---
The only place viable for sniping is the galleria.
---
So I’ve heard. I only just started recently experiencing it
---
I am fine with the item shop being the way it is with rotations.  What I am not fine with is when you buy individual items from a bundle it **DOES NOT** reduce the overall price of that bundle.  Every other game that I have played that offers bundle packs like this shows a reduced cost of you purchased individual items from that pack already.
---
Certain enemies should have a health cap. Mainly bugs. Like you shouldn't need to shoot more bullets than their body mass to kill them
---
The overall effect of the changes to stealth melee isn’t going to be that much different than the changes that occurred to my stealth sniper, only the distance, but if you’re crouching down the hallways the feet the separate you between melee and ranged won’t make much difference, especially if they are ranged opponents and they fire at you.  
---
You go in, make your attack, quickly run off dropping a landmine (not even spec’d in demolitions), drop down to get back into stealth, maybe even utilize a stealth boy.  The damage numbers from our perks are comparable, shoot you have an advantage over me since Ninja gives an overall higher boost than Covert Operative.  Ever other aspect benefits you over me, since you can eat glowing meat steaks for more damage, there are chems that increase your damage more than what I can take to increase my damage.  
---
If I can navigate west tek at level 52 with a stealth sniper, not using one of the meta builds, and make it out alive, there is no reason you couldn’t do it too.
---
Try and get him stuff like legendaries to scrip.build it up then take him for some armor or low level 1 star guns.with the last sale my level 10 got a full set of vanguard armour and I got really lucky with a mutants handmade and a mutant combat rifle.modded those on my main but I am about to outgrow what I have.if your friend is in xbox I can pass him a few pieces of armour and a low level rifle
---
Yeah, tickets are already filed for this one.
---
"Workaround" is to have pacifist active at all times, and no plague walker or electrically charged.
---
I know, this kind of sucks. But as the others said, get the white Knight and gunsmith perk, your armor will be harder and will cost like 20% less materials to repair it.  I did a solo daily ops and forgot to put white Knight perk and all my limbs broke like 5 times each one (have to spent 20 of my repair kits).
---
Wow magic gun you're so good. -_-
---
Yeah, it’s super annoying especially when you’re trying to get somewhere quickly
---
Yup.  Overall 76s design in most ways is stupid.   Junior level stuff.
---
there's no way to power level anymore because of one wasteland. your best bet would be to hop servers for events.
---
Yeah!
---
Mr Torgue approves.
---
I've really been trying to to drum up some sympathy for the complainers but I'm struggling with it, other than just basic human decency and feeling for someone who isn't having a good time. 
---
The reason I don't feel that bad is because in the posts I've seen, they make a point to say they don't want to put any effort into their builds. Well... what do you think this is, guys? I am not aware of any game you can play where you can progress while putting zero thought or effort into it. If it's more difficult than it was a week ago then try harder, or quit and play something that's more fun for you. Definitely no shortage of survival games out there, some even simpler than the (still) pretty innocuous challenges of Fallout 76. Seems like Game Pass gets a new one about every week.
---
The sad part is that it’s gonna take Bethesda ages to fix it just like all the other bugs. If it was any other game I wouldn’t care because they would fix it in a timely manner but not this game. Now we have a useless prop in our camp for god knows how long.
---
I looked at a Mirelurk Queen and fell over dead.
---
Happy cake day.
---
They need to make this sticky. Excellent write up.
---
Why would you start over? You will still get destroyed.
---
Its got booze it in, so its gotta be good for you!
---
yeah, it depends on the enemy.  I find it much easier on things like ghouls and sorched, but super mutants I have to aim upwards, which makes it tougher
---
Last night was awesome with exploding blood eagles. That one was easy. I thought first try we would blow through it being I was on a team with a level 800 and 400. It took use 13 minutes then I teamed with a level 40 and 20 we finished first try at 806 and did it again right Away for 630. I would team with them again. Can’t wait to get off work and do today’s one
---
There's a chart for it.  If you google it you'll probably find it.
---
Yep. I'm using my circuits finally.
---
If you are in a team you will get a notification if someone in your team has started a daily op. You open your map and instead of join, the button should say join team.
---
I personally have had good luck with people in daily ops teams, if I start an op they quickly join in, and if someone else starts an op, I quickly join to help them out.
---
What’s the issue that you’re having? Not enough ammo? Gun too weak? 
---
Also depends on what weapons you’re using
---
Because of the way the armor system works. Let’s say the fire in Colossal hits at about 8 damage per second (I think it’s higher).
---
Fireproof knocks off 45% of that. Making it approximately 4 DPS.
---
Well, 8 damage vs 50 armor is knocked down by a lot. I’m not sure of the exact math, but it’s more like down to 2 damage. So Sizzling Style is approximately twice as good in this scenario.
---
As Unarmed, I usually one-shot 50s and two punch super mutants and spawn, has anyone maxed exploding palm? I also have some in hacknslash as melee vats is always the go-to when somethings nearby. wrecked the exploding Blood Eagles we just had for Ops but couldnt tell how often EP went off
---
For my main character (lvl226) , it’s been a fun change and prompted switching up build for something new. On my low level character, it is the biggest pain in the ass ever.
---
Actually after updating you can’t really know what actually you will have.
---
I mean, everything has changed a lot, and it’s not a common sense that stealth is nearly broken
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance
---
My advice is to try this:
---
1. Remove all your armor and unequip all your perk cards
---
2. Close the game
---
3. Restart the game and re-equip everything
---
This process helped me once when I was in a similar situation. Hope I could help.
---
Ive got one as well on Xbox.  Located at Kanawha cemetery.  Recyclops5795.
---
But he can get destroyed all over again?
---
Nice writeup. ~~Understand most of it but I have 1 question - can you get multiple rare rewards from a single run? For example, if I complete Elder on my first run, does that mean I get a chance at 1 rare reward with boosted odds or chances for 3 rare rewards at their respective rates?~~
---
Nvm. I'm just stupid and missed that line on the first readthrough. Still a really nice writeup.
---
Yep, i shoot with rifles most of the time, only when i'm sneaking in close proximity or get rushed then i'll use the shotgun. Pistols are alright early to mid game imo.
---
Imagine saying headass unironically. 
---
The game hasn’t had any substantial growth since Wastelanders so I doubt they’re too concerned about that. There are the people that will play this game every day until it’s shut down and those are the only people Beth cares about. I’ve SEEN the math. And Bethesda has also said they’re not againts tweaking it in the future. There are many, many, MANY other games better than 76 that people can play as they wait for them to fix OW
---
I wish they put up boundaries like in workshops so it is a clear demarcation of where the range is.
---
Damn sounds like a wasted perk at the moment let's hope they buff it some in the future. Now if it's the strength legendary perk just change your cards around...that is alot of perk points to just go to waste.this is the reason I only use the 1st level perks right now even though I have about 100 +level ups
---
Agreed.  They broke the game for me.  Level 144 and melee player and now up against level 50 - 100 enemies the entire time while doing a lot less damage.
---
Haven't had any issues since patch, PC, Europe
---
I also had this bug and I did not do it on purpose. Right when season 1 launched I did the daily. Went to the place got the thing I needed saw a bone saw on ground grabbed it. Then after turning it in I could complete the daily right away. Just had to talk to him then talk to him again. But yes it’s fixed which I’m fine with being now I can actually leave foundation and explore areas again.
---
I got the clothing rare reward. Kinda useless to me. Rather get any of the plans.
---
Honestly and I hate to admit it the Nerf was just. If they hadn't done so when releasing these Legendary perks people like myself would have build so incredible that we would be able to one shot the SBQ solo without any food, chem, magazine or bobblehead Buffs. Like honestly I'm amazed that they even released these legendary Parks because my character is so OP it's ridiculous.
---
Spoiler alert...it’s basically the same lmao. I haven’t started a new toon since launch but I started one on Tuesday and from what I remember it wasn’t much different. People really be complaining too much about this new patch, like it’s not that bad guys. A slight enemy buff is what we ALL asked for and now we have it and all I see is whiny babies that are butthurt that they have to craft more ammo. And not really actually, my new toon is lvl 17 and I haven’t crafted any ammo at all since the game just throws ammo at you in the early parts doing quests and such.
---
 How is this the thing I'm like 195 have a bunch of shotgun perks enabled and it's still taking me like 12 rounds to kill these measly level 60 fucking super mutants. I literally hate this game at this point. This company is the worst at creating things that are actually fucking fun.
---
The syringer?
---
I am always down for lotr *Mellon Nin*
---
Are you saying that you have both explosive and faster fire rate on the same bloodied weapon, or are you saying that you have one bloodied explosive and 1 bloodied faster fire rate?
---
Orna.
---
It's turned off atm since you could keep using it for up to 100 extra str
---
I usually add a picture that gets their attention for some reason
---
Damn savage
---
Yeah my cousin would gun them low then I’d run and melee them down
---
That’s what I sort of figured, if he had a Tesla rifle would that be effective for tagging enemies? He wants to be rifle and I think I can convince him to use the Tesla. But yeah ur right bad time to be a new player
---
Isn't the gutter plan a thing now too?
---
Ohh snap. I can see hope ppl would abuse that.
---
You’re going to have to make a decent build. Before the update you could breeze through to level 50 then respec to a good build but with one wasteland lower levels are going to have a harder time surviving than before. I’m not saying this is a bad thing though. I played during the beta and the game was definitely harder then than it is now but the update does screw over Lower levels that were already used to the way the game was. So you are going to need to either change the way you play or just accept that this is the way the game is.
---
I approve this message.
---
Good luck.
---
You're dead center in the power curve where enemy hp goes up by x3 but your gear strength only increases by 50%  (from lvl 20-30).
---
It'll only get worse until you hit 30 and you must do the following:
---
- get a level 30 weapon
---
- optimized perks to support that weapon
---
I'd suggest going melee to avoid ammo needs. It sucks but right now shooting bullets prior to having legendary perks to boost ammo crafting is a lost cause.
---
Also having friends to carry you or begging for handouts helps.
---
Uranium Fever and Radiation Rumble drops lots of loot that you can sell. And as others have suggested sell your purified water as often as you can.
---
No. Get new gear. Join an events team and hop events. At the very least you can get good xp doing that relatively safely. 
---
At thirty, you probably don’t have all the cards you need to make your build viable yet.
---
Thank you for sharing this and copying the actual quotes as well. Great post.
---
Jeez. You'd think they'd catch this on the test server? Thanks.
---
I always imagined fixing enemy leveling would be stop level 68 glowing ghouls or mutant overlords from showing up just because a level 100 player is around a level 20 player.
---
Didn't expect to have every cultist, scorched, and wolf in The Forest to be level 50 just because you're level 50+.
---
Agree. I have no trouble on my 29 character, or 150 or 200. Some people just prefer it to be Disneyland, instead of harsh wasteland, its closer to fo4 survival now
---
Explain the mechanics of the game best you can while playing together. 
---
The most frustrating thing is not understanding why you are getting slaughtered repeatedly.
---
Use lunchboxes, well rested, and other xp buffs. 
---
Also tell him to focus on intelligence for better xp.
---
It's a nerf till they get round to balancing.
---
I'd love to see. I've basically ignored enemies in the three DO's we've had so far.
---
Damn glad you made it under 8 min, I got an 8:06 yesterday because no-one knew where to go inside the vault so I was the only one sitting in the repeater range.
---
That sounds like a plan, i imagine I will do a lot of events to get him gear and I can switch between events and intelligence teams since I think that will work nicely. I love this game and have a much fun and I want to make sure he can. Also thanks!
---
Troubleshooters melee weapon. They work great.
---
Yep. I even posted that the guy who made that thread sounded like a condescending douchebag for entirety of his thread lol.
---
My friend, I feel like you didn’t read the post closely enough.
---
Try a "hard reset". Press and hold the power button/light for \~10 seconds (or until the console turns off) then restart the console. After I did the update, the "Scoreboard" map was all black, after reset, everything was back to normal.
---
did Bethesda fuck it up or did u xd
---
Complaints from levels 1-150 about the mismatched damage:health ratios in one wasteland are valid, but if ur 300+ running the best guns and dying to level 50 insects then xd
---
It’s not nonsense, scaling enemies in low level zones to a god tier level that is different to everyone is nonsense. This is the lazy solution to there not being a proper endgame. We should have been given better high level areas to work towards, instead we got this.
---
Next week - “Most popular original perk card, Action Boy/Girl”!
---
N-ice one
---
I think the nerf was needed too but it just completely killed rifleman weapons.
---
All of the above. Armor constantly breaking. sniper rifle and pump action shotgun are barely doing any damage anymore. ammo is getting used up very quickly. I had my camp near the fertile soil mission and it kicks off and I'm knee deep in the battle anytime I travel to my camp.
---
You quit because what was a low level event is now a high level event? Lol
---
Oh yeah, them too, but not the ones at repeater, alpha, and bravo. As soon as one is complete I charge to the next one right past the mobs, and often am alone for a minute or more as others kill all the enemies before moving on. 
---
Looting is another thing, that can wait until its over, theres more than enough time to go back and recover ammo. 
---
PSA: some enemies go meat pile, some go paper bag for whatever reason.
---
The score rewards were not available for testing on the pts
---
I would fail campfire tales almost every time before the update if it was the insect ending. I can never keep the campfire lit, so that one is still the same for me 😂
---
Tesla should work. Even if he wants to go regular rifle, he can always change to it later. As you know, the main point is getting to 50.
---
Oh. You know me. 
---
I can think of 8 different people in 2 different groups who could be called alienfister. Give me a hint. 
---
Isn't Gary's tower spooky enough? Lol. I am adding a couple of Halloween decorations but Gary's camp budget is pretty tight. It's all those little letter signs he slaps all over the place... Even if it is the same 4 letters every time.
---
Not this bloodied player. Damage for me is down by over 60-80%.
---
I'm actually talking about both, PVP or PVE it doesn't matter. If you have a good build then the Nerf doesn't affect anything. And the only reason I brought up PVP is because he said that Commando builds outperform his build, so naturally I assumed that meant he was going up against other players in PvP.
---
If you complete elder your first run you have a very small chance of getting 3 Rare Rewards but also a small chance of getting 0 rare rewards.
---
This is upsetting to read as an anti-social who prefers solo play
---
You aren’t exactly wrong. My gauss rifle and lever are definitely both slower in times to kill than if I just pulled out a canna do weapon.
---
However, while a damage buff would help, the bigger problem is dps focused the game is, which I don’t think can be fixed.
---
Are you located in the toxic divide?
---
If your on the east side of it near the junk/lead nodes are, your almost ontop a couple spawn points, one for a daily quest you start at the Black Bear Inn.
---
I was there for a bit, you gotta be pretty selective how and where you build in that spot. I eventually ended finding somewhere quieter to build, that isnt in a forced spawn point.
---
I live right next to a nice family of Blood eagles now, they leave me alone unless Beckett decides to take some potshots at them.
---
They basically leave my camp alone, unless Beckett runs away from and leads them back to my camp. And im close enough I can pick them off with throwing knives off my back deck.
---
0 turrets is key.
---
Dangerous Deathclaws are great. Dangerous mole rats that eat your face at level 50 in the forest aren't great.
---
If you count games that are just a single purchase, there's quite a few.  XCOM, for example, and quite a few other ports to mobile and a select few original games.
---
Though, I am with you in spirit.  Seems that most enter the mobile market with microtransactions and gambling mechanics.
---
Not so much weapons but I would love to see a receiver mod option for the auto grenade launcher and M79 that changes the type of grenade fired.
---
Tesla Cannon would also be a welcomed addition as I'm a heavy weapon main.
---
Agreed, it first started happening where the guided meditation event happens, could not get away from the place unless I ran out of the area but the last couple of weeks it’s been happening everywhere so I’m always the last to turn up to fight Earle or the SBQ, fast travelling on team mates sometimes helps but even that can fail sometimes, I hope Bethesda fix it soon I’ve got places to go and people to see as they say lol
---
Tea Time Event spawns many ants
---
Everyone talking about their builds being ruined but the real tragedy is the osmosis kit being fixed 😭
---
it's sec, I hadn't seen you on reddit til now haha
---
Wait, what, I thought the Brotherhood and the initial quests were coming this winter?
---
I've not noticed a lack of players or public teams, but there has been huge reduction in nuke launches, i've only seen two since the update, and both were SBQ, she was still downed easily so it's not like it's because of the new damage calculations.
---
Maybe it's people just focusing on those daily ops for now *shrug*
---
Not so much the 20 lvls as doing the season. A lot of places to get perk packs to scrap.
---
Thanks for the offer, but I don’t wanna bother. I got lots of legendaries to scrip, sometimes an overflow so I imagine I can get him scrip easy. I plan to make him recon rifles and other armors, so hopefully he’ll be ok for awhile. Thanks again dude
---
the clothes don't make the man
---
i saw bloodied people die to level 12 ants there before the update. So calm ya tiddies.
---
There were some perks on the PTS at the start that were removed. Not sure if it was Botany Buddy, but there was one that gave some DR for some time after eating plants, and not really worth it at all.
---
Based
---
:D i heard ian say that line thank you!
---
Go ahead and add me " *I can tell that we are gonna be friends* "
---
A front row seat to why the world is turning to hot shit.
---
Ppl still do that.
---
Casual/unoptimized ppl got what you're talking about but the folks at the top see no changes
---
Hack and Slash appears to be way more effective from a damage perspective, I just don’t like that it’s only relevant if you’re in a group. Also, I don’t really like vats for melee hits and it’s not cohesive with Dodgy and I love that perk.
---
You need to take him to visit every green humanoid in the game. So Grafton Mill, Horizons Rest, West Tek, Nicholson, General Steak House, West Tek. I'm sure there are more.
---
Give him an auto grenade launcher or a lower level explosive gun to tag with. He'll be lv 50 in a couple days.
---
Yeah I thought events would help a lot for early gear and stuff. I really hoped we could just grind out levels but rip I guess, thanks dude
---
Yup, the game is now too frustrating and actually have any fun while playing. For me it may be time to move on.
---
I seldom buy stuff from the Atom Shop, but for my shotgun build I picked up the orange hunting hat and vest. Added a pair of patrolman’s sunglasses and a double barrel (AAE) and she’s good to go.
---
Oh yea level 20-30 is a nightmare. Blew through all my stimpacks and ammo trying to stealth kill my way through a super mutant area to get an AI thing for the robot raider lady. Ended up having to give up on it after 5 deaths over 2 days of trying lol
---
A total perk coin repec is what I was thinking. Pay X perk coins to move X points.
---
Well that’s why radroaches are so hard for you to kill
---
Except they are inherently outside of the design rendering your bragging invalid
---
lmao, how can perk loadouts be so fucking hard for them.
---
For all weapons?? How do we know that? If that's the case, it's been bugged  for over a fucking year. I've had the shotty for that long, I hardly use it though.
---
Absolutely agree! It actually feels like a game again instead of like, a chatroom or something. 
---
And it's still pretty easy. Just a bit more satisfying. More XP, all legendaries I get are max lvl. And with legendary perks, I still feel overpowered.
---
Meh Explosive Plasma go Brrrrrrt!
---
I also try to play a protecter role in events so now I’m a godsend to a lot of folks and I like to keep helping anyone stay alive.
---
Did someone forget to put wood in the campfire?
---
It also allows you to have an emergency perk fund for when you accidentally scrap that max level card because you weren't paying attention.
---
Every enemy will have that modifier. You will never be able to sneak in daily ops
---
Idk man I saw people struggle at mama dolces alot pre update lmfao.
---
Campfire Tales as well.
---
I’ve seen you post several times and I’m flabbergasted by your lack of basic comprehension. 
---
You state that your numbers have not changed at all. Ok. I’ll go with you. 
---
But now everything in the game scales to the optimal, maximum efficiency for a creature/hostile at that point in time. Some guy even put the numbers on the front page of reddit for you to see. 
---
If your numbers have not changed at all, and the enemy you are fighting is now level 50 as opposed to level 10, you’re going to do less damage. A lot less damage. ***Meaning you have been nerfed***.
---
There doesn’t need to be a change in numbers on the player’s side for there to be an effect on player power.
---
Your posts are completely ignorant and devoid of any logic.
---
Definitely agree! Some days I can’t play until late at night but then the very next day I can play much earlier. Too bad scrip and bullion don’t reset until much later in the day so I’m stuck trying to play with a backpack full of scrip weapons/armor or I just go play a different game instead. Still, would be nice if it all reset at a specific time of day for sure. So many different time zones may pose a problem though. It’d have to be  dependent on your time zone I guess.
---
I tried out a lvl 5 character, and the enemies don't seem to scale that much. As a lvl 5 character, the enemies in the area where a lvl \~100 teammate were, were still mostly around lvl 40-60 (when their were no high-level players in the area, the enemies did scale to my level). The drops still scaled to my level though.
---
It’s prob you haha. Put some power on
---
Are the devs aware that stealth builds would like to enjoy Daily Ops? Do none of them play stealth?
---
Does this mean the half a dozen God roll laser rifles I've had in my stash might be useful now?
---
That would be cool
---
Geez, looking at that curve table I have to assume someone looked at it for a second and said "Yep, that'll do. Happy weekend, everyone!"
---
I mean, I played on the PTS and knew what to expect but this is hilarious.
---
I'm guessing it's the same thing for the XP tables. Level 100 muties, without any XP buffs, don't seem to be paying an awful lot of more XP when compared to level 50s.
---
Yeah, I also think that legendary taking one for the team perk will help him out. Hopefully at least lol
---
Yep, this was the last straw, it is a good game and I enjoyed it, nice experience but time to move on
---
The people who like the update are too busy playing it to bitch here. Things are a little bit skewed
---
Nah, tbh even pre-update the 30-40-50 phase is toughhhhhhh.
---
It sucks! I dunno what the deal is but if we don’t hit the damn thing don’t show the damage ffs. Oh well!
---
Idk about that, I main running heavy weapons and I didn't even think to take ammo factory.
---
Run the daily op and basically get 500-1000 rounds of ammo ON TOP of whatever I was using per run.
---
Crafting ammo seems almost pointless now and I love it.
---
I did my first last night at lvl 33. Was in a group of randoms. Nobody talking, no idea what's going on other than I'm melting through ammo. Pretty sure the team was mad. Got 2 thumbs down. Gonna leave those alone for a while. 
---
If you see this team, I'm sorry.
---
How so?   It’s still gaining them the additive nature they wanted for various legit reasons.   But separating one calculation set out.   Still far less brokenath than how it was 2 days ago pre-patch.  :)
---
Even if we have to wait until next year, these are free ideas lol. Better late than never, eh?
---
I would have thought people could have been cool and kept it quiet.
---
Yeah it also happens to me on Ps4. It's a performance issue. There's a ton of framedrop  moments in this game. As soon as fights are getting a lil too intense, sometime it seems like everything can trigger massif framedrops.
---
And yeah the quick wheel is bugged af since months.
---
I'm firm in my belief on that. STealth ranged builds are boring and those players are the first ones to complain about being bored with the game. Change your fucking build.
---
Here’s the thing though people who don’t have dedicated builds are getting fucked that is a lot of the casual players which I believe is the majority.
---
It got sketchy the second the kits showed up, after months of "cosmetics only" bullshit about the store from Bethesda. Add to it that they've now made it harder to earn atoms, and the writing on the wall went from spray paint to neon lighted letters.
---
Lmao, god tier he says. I made a new character and  did just fine with normal weapons. You people are just cry babies.
---
You can do it a bunch of times to just wander and get the feel of it.
---
Yes. I didn’t know about this until someone mentioned it on this subreddit yesterday.
---
On my first go today we ended at 8 min 6 sec. Almost! I’d like to think we could have made it if everyone just stood by the boosters and soaked up damage.
---
Then stay in the challenging areas?
---
How would you feel if you're level 200 and you have to fight a level 1 SBQ with level 1 loot because a level 1 player in the event wanted to feel "included".
---
Yeah I thought going ham on feeding the people and forcing stew down him will help, also think I can protect him well enough, thanks dude
---
I think it would be fun to try take a workshop from ya!
---
Been on 5 servers today and had atleast 2 nukes launched on all of them
---
I had 12 luck and wanted to get to 15, would have been a waste not  to to fully rank that card and make the most of the Leg slot so I moved a point off luck over to agility before fully ranking that card rather than just leave it at rank 3, no idea if that’s the right way to go about it but with only half a dozen slots I’m trying to get the most out of them
---
I shit you not, an hour after I posted this, I was handed a Bloodied Revolver from the Daily Op. Sick sense of humor.
---
Thanks. That's the interpretation I was hoping was right.
---
Now that’s real interesting... rip emmet mountain  scavengers lol
---
I think the arms need better mods in general. Not sure what. Like the stabilized idea though.
---
Rough luck, only have had 3 chances so far, since you only get that juicy 80% once a day.
---
Ash heap has ants and crickets
---
Biv would be great, as long as he brings along the nukashine jukebox
---
How would I ever be able to solo one of these Daily Ops on my own win any real way that is fun?
---
hope you enjoy it :)
---
*"When you are level 300 and die at Campfire Tales failing the event with full unyielding sentinel AP refresh, Fixer or Handmade, it means Bethesda really fucked it up, thank you and I am done with the game unfortunately, it was a good ride!" -*
---
No, it means you propably either bought your items with real money, duped them, or got the items from friends who dupe. Certainly didn't earn them by actually playing the game. Thus you are lacking basic ability to play this game efficiently and with any sort of skill. L2p issue.
---
Just got the symptomatic. Pretty cool
---
It is but has fixed affixes.
---
Afaik the War Glaive, even without Legendary affixes, is best base melee damage currently
---
Do you have makeshift warrior? I have it and my deathclaw gauntlet has been absolutely fine for condition. Everyone else may be running other intelligence perks so their melee weapons break much faster.
---
And lots of stims, scrap, etc
---
Tea Time &amp; Campfire Tales are good go-to events for Ants and Ticks both.
---
I got a junkies faster fire rate, 90% reduced Gatling plasma. I am hopefully closer to a 3 star minigun.
---
I gave you a point for "no fucks given" :P
---
It is devoid of any humor.
---
Right... I'm at 12 agility so I should move 2 points to somewhere else and max out the legendary agility card...
---
That gear and weapons and still fail u say?   
---
Might have to look in the mirror to see the problem.
---
Um, not really no. Unarmed since the beginning, bloodied for the last few months, I'm still fine. Things might take 2 punches anymore and stealth is ruined for ops but I rarely ran stealth perks.
---
No one knows dear Pubes, no one knows, although instead because I have a good heart you can get my uny ap sentinel left arm, I don't like your username and that is all I can give you, I will leave a post for donating my god rolls :)
---
I’ve gotten two vault 94 jumpsuit plans in a row. RNG-SUS WHYYYY
---
*update: finished today’s in 7:43 with a team of 3. No rare reward at all :(((((
---
Pretty much.  There are a few spawns for ants as well but they always seem to spawn along with their mortal enemy, the deathclaw...for some reason.  Deathclaw tends to win before you can even get close enough to hit them.  
---
Power substation just north of Watoga has a few (and a deathclaw) if you like server hopping a lot.
---
Put food condition on the hot wheel!
---
Thank you everyone for the suggestions! I guess I’ll try temporarily building for melee until I can get into the 30s.
---
I like it and mostly run a commando.  A little teamwork with a few melee and a few bashes and it is fine.   in a multiplayer game that requires teamwork seems like a good thing.  I do wish for these events they had a lobby with chat to help teams of randos to coordinate and launch together.
---
This isn’t an airport. There’s no need to announce your departure. 
---
*Um, I mean...* **Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.**
---
Just stay on the uplink, Shinji
---
That’s a cool joke.
---
I would also recommend you look at Stealth as well, it would appear you altered its calculations to additive, but it’s still listed as multiply.  It seems stealth builds took the hardest hit to this update.  Wouldn’t be surprised to see stealth builds shimmer away in the wasteland
---
You should test junkies.
---
The only issue I've had, though seemingly much improved today, are ranged attacks in VATS. Yesterday I couldn't score a hit for toffee; bullets were hitting their targets but damage wasn't registering, or just missing all together... irratiing would be understating it!
---
Pistols need a lot of love too.
---
Funny man, funny man, I like it, other words of wisdom behind a screen mate?
---
im running a cal 50 atm and im REALLY happy about the ammo factory legendary perk :D 
---
Try it
---
My bad, I get what you mean
---
That'll work. And nades canwork well.
---
Seems like there is a lot of people commenting here who hated the bloodied build because they never got there themselves!! I feel sad for all of you 😂😂😂
---
Yeah I came here to post after failing to find a single ant over 8 hops north of Watoga haha. On the plus side, got like 25 stimpacks from those death claws for today's daily ops.
---
"I am not mad, I am dissapointed."
---
-BoS Collectron
---
Yeah they are fantastic unless you're talking about low lvls then it's meh
---
Hi sec. Funny name. You can imagine me wondering who chose the name alienfister.
---
If u don’t mind telling why humanoids? I never felt them to be much easier or anything. Maybe I’m a fool lmao
---
Daily Ops with food and drugs that boost intelligence
---
Why not make that spooky fireplace a spoopy variant of the fireplace door? (Either way, give it either blue or green fire)
---
Now that I think about it, they could make a secret door bookcase too
---
What increases that rate?
---
I don’t regret fully ranking it up. Dude i primed my non explosive gat plasma before patch and would get around 6 ultrice cores for 2 plasma cores with ammunition perk and super duper. Now I get 9 with out super duper. I had ten plasma cores last night and switched them and had almost 50. That perk card is amazing. I had 200 556 and went to my bench and had 2k only using like 40 steel and 40 lead. I def don’t regret it. The ammo from acp and daily is just a extra bonus
---
Only for these uplink ops
---
Super mutants have the highest xp per kill/level in the whole game for an abundant creature. They're green and humanoid :)
---
Now if death claws were only as prolific. Lv 100 death claws are giving me 1k xp a pop these days! Lv 100 muties only cough up 500!
---
wait those are rare? i got the plans for it on my first elder run
---
I noticed - No Halloween Events!
---
Just absolutely unbelievable!
---
Well to be completely honest with you, casual players are never going to be able to take full advantage of the Legendary perks system to begin with. Do you know casual players may be able to rank up a single legendary perk fully. But none of them will ever hit the levels that some of us hardcore have achieved.
---
I stopped bragging as a child) this is a simple statement of facts and nothing else. 
---
save your sarcastic remarks for other threads &amp; discussions
---
You on xbox? If so your welcome to come in with me any time. We aren't all born perfect pal.
---
had it yesterday, went through 600 bullets on my cal 50, holy shit
---
...and don't run in front of the person trying to fix or boost the signaling devices as it resets their progress. I don't know how many times I had to give up because someone was getting between me and the device...and that's with my face buried in the device. :D
---
Are you using an explosive shotty? Do you have enforcer and skeet shooter as well as all the shotgunner perks equipped? And are they maxed out? That’s all I’m using. Plus all my mutations and that list goes on. I use all of them except the bloodie types.
---
Found the same thing on pc. Played the day of the patch, it was too depressing, haven’t been back since.
---
Bleed damage coming soon to an enemy near you. In Fallout 4 the Wounding legendary effect applied stacking bleed damage that enemies had no resistance to, so I imagine our player characters don't have any bleed resist either. Super mutants with miniguns bleeding you to death seems like the obvious choice.
---
The suggestion is to let us choose perk coins directly instead of having to pick a card and then scrap it to get coins.
---
Hahahahaha this comment made my day.
---
+1. Also a silent mode for the Slocum Joe’s vendor please. I love his doughnut head but his little song drives me crazy. So annoying.
---
I've been running it repeatedly for the legendary items. Pulling in almost as much ultra 2mm as I'm using, and I picked up 10 3\* items yesterday. Much more efficient than hunting legends elsewhere. 
---
Great write-up!
---
Daily ops have been out a solid day and a half and reddit can’t contain themselves from being assholes. Hot take, but not everyone sinks their life into this website and this game. People are still learning. If you’re playing with someone that clearly is new, send them a polite message to help them out. Yelling into the void helps no one and makes this subreddit worse. 
---
Thank you for coming to my TED talk /s
---
Nah, that pretty much covers everything i wanted to say when i saw what you wrote.
---
Omg yes! It’s so annoying. You don’t even have to loot bodies because you get all the ammo back at the end so just stand by the signal boosters. And if you are on a daily ops team, I shouldn’t sit around for 30 minutes waiting for someone to go on a daily ops mission
---
Seems the way to go to me but others may have other ways to optimise build/tweak perk loadouts 👍
---
&gt; Beth flipped the huge nerf switch and walks away, drops the mic...
---
&gt; The game needed balance but not as severe and all at once.
---
you kind of contradict yourself here, do you want them to balance it all at once or not? Because the did first pass now, next is coming along as you wanted in that second sentence...
---
Alright man!
---
More players. You get +1x capture rate per player, but if you're fast and tanky enough you only need the one. Definitely better to do it with more players though, to get it done faster or to account for lost time.
---
What do you mean? Did I do a mistake in the calculation?
---
Because ego. I went from 1700 to 350 ish. I am still effective. Multiple 300 dmg shots just doesn’t make me feel godly.
---
This is interesting because I run AAE weapons with penetrating mods and Tank Killer, and my typical damage is less than listed as well.
---
Which one do you prefer? I like the vats perk since it maxes out at 50%, but the on kill perk can trigger even when I am just whaling on them waiting for my AP to regen?
---
One shots deathclaw with magic shotgun no perks.  Watches lvl80 get owned by mole rats.
---
Damn, I already finished it. Can I go back?
---
WHY can a single MODDER put out that thing out of "nothing" and it works real fine and is exactly what the community wanted (i guess) and the developers seem not to be able to just include the stuff into their work?
---
Everything but the explosive shotgun
---
Press a button, choose your 50 levels special increase and I guess choose new perk cards, not sure how it would work in this game
---
I got the plan on my first Elder clear and it looks fantastic. If you’re PS4 I’d be happy to construct one for you if you’re getting no luck in finding it.
---
Look, I'm not saying we should be able to romance Athena.
---
..but let me romance the god damn robot.
---
You only tested bloody...
---
Can you even go into a private world if you're uninvited?
---
If someone doesn't want you to join  their private world, they can set it to team only.
---
If they let you join their world, they're either unaware they can "lock" their world, or didn't want to lock it. Youre good, methinks.
---
Hahaha “Earl and the Windigos”. I hear mandolins and banjos.
---
I want this with a set of night Goggles
---
Ah, then it's a tank's time to shine.
---
WHY ARE PERK LOADOUTS SO HARD TO MAKE
---
Haven’t they been on the PTS for a while? I assume they work as intended. 
---
Maybe not as you expected?
---
Regular heavy PA non-bloodied/junkie here, I like the changes since not much have changed anyway, and these are **enemies** now, instead of a distractions between point A and B
---
Let me know if you ever move over to pc. I've been trying to gather a gary of Garys so we can gary West Gary... Really spook people out.
---
Look buddy, I've been on this game for a while. Us players who were here from the jump were dragged through the ringer. I had to battle 3 scorch beasts in that fire station with a nerfed TSE Gauss rifle before they even included SB in the legendary pool. This is just one encounter of many and I'm sure I'm not alone. Did we bitch? No. We instead figured out and shared proper builds that newer players take for granted. Instead of complaining that it's hard, take some time out of your exploration schedule and just reevaluate your perk card order. Simple.
---
I've died more times in the last two days than I have in the past six months.
---
edit: And I just got slaughtered by a Legendary Liberator Mk 0.
---
It’s all them bloodied commandos just sat on the forklift fucking sniping me
---
😁😁😁 yeah, I was surprised as well that I actually had to recover the equipment 😂😂 I was trying to get Ward cough up the freebie but he just kept yammering on his stuff instead of giving me the rewards.
---
Open up the game manager and check what files you have downloaded for it. Restart Xbox and check for updates.
---
Ps5 will have backwards compatibility for fo4 at launch but no mention of fo76 lol
---
They’ll release it with a missing texture and incorrect functionality lol. Seriously though, that would be cool.
---
The first part of the game is a struggle.  Don't build up your camp right now.  Just try to level up and get stronger
---
Absolutely this.
---
For fuck’s sake - this patch isn’t even a business week old, and people are already popping off with the “lol ez farm mode git gud scrub” attitude.
---
Go back to 2008 WoW with that stupid shit.
---
True that
---
“All you had to do was follow the damn train CJ!” - Big Smoke
---
I solo'd one yesterday to see what all the bitching was about, wasted \~ 2500 10mm rounds on the silo and Earl.
---
It’s pretty satisfying and funny as hell. I equipped the Far Flung Fireworks legendary perk for lols, but then realized other cards are far more useful for my build so swapped it out. ah well.
---
You think to highly of the devs.
---
In a front page thread detailing the wonky hp curve of enemies (lvl 14-23 sees enemy hp triple) one of the devs commented that IN THE COMING WEEKS they'll make some changes.
---
Scaling is literally shitting in new players faces and they can't quickly do anything. 
---
They can't do additive and multiplicative.  Too much for them
---
Don't think it got fixed. As usual, just to stay on the safe side:
---
Don't check the atom shop/scoreboard from the main menu unless you have already played an adventure mode server that session
---
Don't start a daily session with playing NW
---
Try not to be online within a few minutes of the daily reset
---
Don't crash while loading into your first world (not anything you can really do about this, but having too many processes running or having the steam overlay enabled increase your odds of crashing during loading)
---
After loading in for the first time, give the game time to properly load in before checking the atom shop/scoreboard (~20-30 seconds on a SSD, 1-4 minutes on hard drives)
---
Yes most people won’t take advantage of legendary perks but that should not be the difference between a fun and a shitty experience.
---
I also play a tank. I agree, we should be able to pull agro easier.
---
I find melee builds have an easier time pulling aggro, but thats due to high burst dmg and pathfinding is super easy for the enemies? Idk.
---
If your friends with them you can hop in if they haven't set it to invite only.
---
Same here. Came to post this as well.
---
Fireproof doesn’t do a % though. The perk card says it does, but it’s wrong. Without it equipped a car explosion did 12 damage to me, with only rank 1 equipped it did 6 damage. And yes, they were both the same type of car and I was standing in the same spot both times
---
That's not enough kiddo, show me that passion that you have for this game, because everything else I can see you are not so smart, what else I made, since the launch? Don't stop now, I am barely having fun
---
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck 
---
not the freezing one, i hate that one.
---
Press the collapse button in the "World Activity" pane; lower left of the screen on map menu.
---
Oh I thought it was all the time. Guess I misunderstood. Thanks for letting me know
---
I have been lucky. I ran it solo my first time and I died... a lot. Melee against robots was not kind to me. But then I ran the Exploding Blood Eagles with randoms and we did a pretty good job every time. We ended up getting it done to unlock all the tiers. 
---
But I will say it would be helpful if people mic'd up and said, everyone know how to do this? I have been using the "come here" emote to get players to stick with me, but newbies might not know what they're doing straight away.
---
was this in daily ops?
---
I put it on and remembered watching a video on how bad this perk is so i got to switch it out. I’m also staying away from the food build conveniency perks like ammo factory and master infiltrator
---
well, we knew for a long time that the damage calculation will change, from multiplying damage factors to adding. so, the damage change was obvious.  
---
the healing part is quite strange, never saw this at a non legendary enemy so far.
---
That is so Bethesda... 'earn a reward, oh wait, stop using that reward because we programmed it shitily'.
---
Stolen? Good that Ward put a tracker on it then ;)
---
Installing forceful stocks is the equivalent to Lvl5 Gunsmith.  Another reddit told me that a couple weeks ago and it turned out to be true.
---
They need to just add a damage calculator in game.  You look at the details of a weapon/armor/whatever and it shows you how everything is being stacked.  Kind of like the effects page for all of your active effects, but with real numbers.
---
Then it soesn't have to be intuitive, because they are telling you how it works.
---
Ops seems faster. 6 minute run for 2 legendaries, no loadings, no Messing up glitches. Plus It drop more relevant loot like fixers and SS armor
---
Yes but its like the fixer with fixed stuff and legendary rolls
---
1. Loot everything, and sell them at robot vendors at train stations etc. You can earn 1400 caps daily by doing this. Vendors reset their caps after 20h from your first use of them, and all vendors share their caps pool.
---
2. Same answer (kinda) again. Loot everything and haul them to your camp for scrapping and storage. You can also use other players camps for this, or train stations as they have stash boxes.
---
3. At later levels ammo crafting becomes very efficient with all the perks you can get for it. At the start and in lower levels you will be short of them all the time. Don't restrict yourself in using just one type of weapon. Use any weapon you have ammo for, and even melee. At lower levels when you don't have lots of damage related perks it doesn't matter what weapon you use.
---
Melee is your friend for leveling up, the new patch makes the game very hard
---
How do you actually join someone in a Daily Ops? Or get people to join you? Even in a DO team, they don't come with most of the time.
---
Once I collapse it, it still opens back up into the main screen upon reopening the map! Sucks
---
My main is a PA heavy/2-hand and I've had no issues the last 2 days. I died once, soloing the burrows for the 1st op. The robots got me but just the one time. Not only do I not think the changes are a bad thing, I've enjoyed playing more than I have in months. Since WL first came out, anyway.
---
Still I'm willing to give people at least some benefit of the doubt. Maybe my main is better equipped to handle the changes than most people are.
---
I've got a few other characters. I will run the pistol-medic and berserker rifleman tonight and see how they do. If I get rolled then I guess the people who are complaining are right. If the game is still fun though then it's a big "git gud" to one and all.
---
Thanks for that.
---
Oh, damn. Sounds like a UI glitch indeed then.
---
What are you talking about? Didn't you even click the link [https://www.fo76calc.com/](https://www.fo76calc.com/)? You can just enter your values how you want?!
---
Junkie is 50% damage in Legendary Prefix...
---
The Bloodied are examples, I won't post every build here just use the fo76calc
---
Gunsmith lv5: it takes its time to break my guns. high ROF usually breaks faster. have to repair usually only every two or three play sessions. depends a lot on playstyle. i cycle guns depending on situation, so the strain on them is divided on them all, thus a single gun wears down slower. explosive guns usually break rather fast. the model here needs severe overdoing i´d say...
---
I'm not aware of a scraping mechanic.  If you're unsure what you want, try out a perk on lvl 1 for a while.
---
Try melee for a while, that will save you ammo.
---
Don’t build a camp yet just put down 4x4 platform, 
---
Sell everything , cook all meat and sell it eat veggies which you can plant at your camp
---
Sell purified water
---
Bugger! I’ll try send a report on that then
---
Who would have thought radroaches would end up being the victors in that all out free for all?
---
Whatever dude, I'm definitely going to be scoping out some interiors and I don't even like CAMP building all that much.
---
Melee is still working reasonably well for me.  I was already at 15 base STR + 4 STR for underarmor, however much marsupial gives , +1 on legendary armor, or.... in PA, motion assist servos on the PA (+2 STR)
---
I think the bigger difference is the enemies are higher level (ergo, stronger), so it take more hits to kill them (and they hit harder).  
---
For example, pre OW, not using foods/chems, And using a SS ghoul slayers switchblade, it took  1-3 hits to take out L42-68 ghouls at WS.  Now the ghouls are L60-100, so it takes 3-7 hits. 
---
Similarly, L100 glowing mole miners now take 4-5 hits instead of the L40’s taking 2-3 (using a L50 vampire switchblade).
---
A portion of it can be offset with legendary perks like take one for the team, regular perks, like bloody mess, or a combination thereof.  (I added both)
---
I’m with you. I have god roll weapons doing didly now.
---
There was a post that broke down why the changes are bad mathematically. When you looked at the math, it made sense and does not scale equally at all. You will notice a much bigger change in difficulty when you hit 25-30ish, which is when the curve for enemy HP and armor starts to greatly outpace your damage. 
---
Additionally, this means gear breaks much much more often, and you can go through a ton of ammo quickly. If you are a newer player, without the experience and knowledge that these changes can make it overwhelming. I am not having a hard time on my main, and a fun time on my main. (205 and I think 33 or something). My girlfriend who is brand new to the game mostly (level 53 or 54) is having a really hard time and it is making her almost not want to play. Its not even the amount of ammo or the challenge, but how often her gear breaks even when I hop on my main and repair it to have double durability. As she wanted to explore and not just find a build and copy it, her build is not nearly as streamlined as would be the case for a lot of newer or more casual players. I think the biggest change they should add is better scaling when comparing player damage to enemy health/armor, as right now it is ridiculously skewed. I think if I recall correctly on the post with the math breakdown, without perks you are looking at 120% increased damage on lvl 50 gear whereas enemies have almost 800% increased health and who even knows how much armor. That scaling needs to be adjusted. Im all for adding harder content, but that content should not be throughout the whole world and should be instanced content or specific areas so as to allow newer players to not suffer while allowing more experienced/better geared/more streamlined built players the ability to do challenging content if they choose. 
---
The other big issue is at 50+ you really do need to have a very streamlined build as many will not work very well at all, aside from a few. This limits the ability of players to have choice in their builds. This is why I think that they need to adjust the scaling a lot, and add in harder more challenging content in another way or method. The daily ops is a nice touch, and if they made it to where there is more daily op content and they had difficulty scales on it that you can choose that would increase enemy damage/hp/armor this might be a good compromise for players in general.
---
Yes, that is what I meant to say. Thank you
---
They need to co-create fallout sims for all these people that just want to dress up and play house
---
I would need to sort out my camp budget and I'm not with my ps4 at the moment. But thank you for the offer though, that's really thoughtful.
---
And you’re just not getting the point of scaling levels. If I got back to vault 76 on my level 100 I could see level 100 ghouls.
---
Would have been more interesting to see new high level areas with the map expanded. This game is all about doing the least amount of work to make changes to keep the users happy to keep making bank from atom shop.
---
I don't know what you did, but obviously it wasn't related to actually playing the game if you think it is hard enough to bitch and whine about. And also, i'm not that easily categorized as a "kiddo", as i'm 46.
---
sorry i cant hear you over my instigating VATS gauss pistol
---
I recieved the plans for "the gutter", oh and i got the b.o.s. gas mask so thats cool
---
Alr level 32 here gonna give some advice 
---
1. Best way to get caps is to sell unwanted legendys and ammo and dont buy from protection vendors or if I want to grind more for caps super mutants and workshops are a good way 
---
2. Materials-get the scraper perk and scrap tons of guns or check out keveduit.com for other locations for rarer mats 
---
3. Ammo- equip scrounger and use a melee  weapon up to level 25 to 30 as then u have all gun perks also suggest captain noob for weapons on YouTube and badcompanyasarg for builds most player vendors cell common ammo at like 1 cap a bullet or clear out interior dungeons they reset evey 24 hours and clear out low level scorched as they carrie common wepons or join a daily ops team an desk for help as you get alot of ammo from bodys 
---
Hoped this helped and happy hunting
---
Running the silo is a bit more arduous now, especially if you don't luck out and get one where the Laser Turrets are already destroyed.  Those things are irrationally tanky.  The silo, as a whole, isn't particularly rewarding for the person running it.  Seldom do you find Legendaries, and much of the XP from the robots is purposely nerfed.
---
And it is outstanding.  I doubt the implementation Beth gives will be as simple or powerful.
---
i did the one yesterday with my friend, only the two of us and it was not easy but not hard either  
---
just d'ont spend your time between signal and RUN, leave the enemy behind
---
[https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/gilgamesh19-fullhealthshotgunmelee1/](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/gilgamesh19-fullhealthshotgunmelee1/)
---
At least you got something. I haven’t received any rare or uncommon plans yet. Best thing I got was a 2* script item. lol. Here’s to hoping the RNG Gods are on my side today.
---
Gaaaaaaaary
---
IMO caps come with time.. it took me a while to have a decent amount. With building supplies I litterly still take and scrap everything... i mean everything!!! Sorry about the ammo problem I play melee so I don't worry too much with ammo only for a few guns and I only use them for major events.(SBQ and colossus)
---
My friend on the other hand is usuaing a shot gun mostly so I pick up ammo from random kills and give it to him, I wish i had better advice for you. BUT make friends .... alot of higher level players are more then happy to help lower levels. My friend is low 30s im 133 I think, I help him out when ever I can.  I'm on Playstation if your interested or want some help let me know. I'm not a great player but I do like to have fun!
---
Dang! The one system I don't play on :(  I'll see if I know anyone who does who can help you out.
---
This is the worst update ever. Server keeps kicking me out 5 seconds into the game, ALWAYS. Bethesda can seriously NEVER do anything right.
---
If u need more help PM me on here happy to help
---
I agree to liking challenges, but take exception to bullet sponges. I appreciate varied attack-dodge-cover-tank-heal mechanics that require different strategies for different enemies. 
---
One of the big improvements FO4 introduced was the way humans would hide behind cover or act as snipers, Deathclaws would weave and dodge, Mirelurks would hunker to protect the face and belly, and Super Mutants would tend to attack from elevated positions while some rush on foot. I love how this altered gameplay approach. The Encryptid event and Scorched Earth when the entire Drop Site bunker vicinity is included in the blast zone require some actual work and I enjoy the way they implemented the different attacks of the Wendigo Colossus. 
---
That said, there is value in having casual content in areas and an event like Tea Time or powering up the power plants (I like trying to get all three each play session) is kind of like the equivalent of picking flowers - just a nice, low key decompression kind of event with no real rewards to casually do between the bigger things.
---
I agree that there ought to be more tough events, but more than that, I’d like to see regular events/quests of easy, moderate, and hard difficulty in each of the regions. The Ash Heap has the nicest mix for me, honestly. Have you tried Lode Bearing or Earth Mover since the update? These can be pretty tough and fun for me now, while playing music in Beckley and the micro-Dailies at Camden park are a nice casual walk-through while Breach and Clear is now a decent medium-effort event. The Savage Divide events used to be more diverse in difficulty and are now mostly on the tougher end. Protecting my camp from enemy spawns when someone fast travels to me actually requires my intervention now, rather than leaving it to my turrets. I very much appreciate that they are working to create tougher and more engaging content, but like having the option to decompress in certain areas and events or at my camp in-between the activities I have to actually work for or make sure I’m equipped for with correct perk cards, ammo, and armor before jumping in.
---
I like being able to do a variety of difficulties depending on my mood - makes it so I can come to one game and always find something for how I’m feeling at the moment rather than choosing between different games based on what mood I’m in.
---
A lot of times that can be fixed by blueprinting the object and placing it.
---
not all the time but a solid 80% of the time I can place down a blueprint where it says "item needs support" for a regular item
---
Some of the procs are single precent, it’s difficult to test them, at least for me
---
Damage falloff seems a little too extreme to allow for using the galleria to its sniping potential. Even with long shot 3.
---
3 times in a row I've had "None" as my Elder reward.
---
Really digging this new event, Bethesda. /s
---
use this to find stuff to make stuff

They are fun. I’ve only ever had 2 in my 76 lifetime. one was a 2 star troubleshooters explosive combat shotgun and now I have a supressors 3 star explosive combat shotgun. I love it. I prefer the combat over the pump action. It reloads much faster.
---
I just waited 5 mins and then there were paper bags everywhere!
---
Play as Herbivore (buy some mutations before you’d receive needed perks to fix mutations) &amp; find receipt of Cranberry relish +25% to exp. ur levels should grow faster. 
---
Take place in events = exp. 
---
Look for marine tactical helmet plan = some junk to craft &amp; sell to vendor (caps)
---
Plan ur build now. Dont use perks which arent part of ur future build
---
Dont build camp now. All needed is on camps of other players
---
Remember that terms agreement we accepted just a few days ago? It said people couldn’t use 3rd party mods. So there goes all the cheaters lol
---
Haha, probably but we’ll still love it lol
---
And yeah I’ve secretly hoped for that skin every week the Shop updates since the Fixer came out haha
---
Not sure where the whole beef started, but those two enemies have it out for each other.
---
My original C.A.M.P spot, which I encountered the mutants at, was in the toxic valley. I have moved it over to the forest now and placed it near a different junk node.
---
Nooooooope. I breathe sarcasm like a fish does water.
---
Ch-ch-ch-check yo privilege!
---
Ps: you absolutely bragged in the comment i responded to, but the vox populi told you that in advance.
---
I do know that Lock and Load is now broken.   
---
I always have it equipped when using heavy guns.   Was fighting Earl last night and noticed that it worked once then stopped working for the rest of the fight.
---
Did the same during a SBQ fight and found the same problem. I unequipped it and the equipped it again and it worked once, then stopped working again.  
---
I seem to remember this being a bug 5 or 6 patches ago.  Swapping weapons was the workaround as it's faster than swapping the perk.  
---
I wonder if they used old code for the Wastelanders update and didn't incorporate previous bug fixes.
---
I'll try that out. Thanks
---
Thank you. This is very clear.
---
You can get multiple rare rewards at once btw.
---
I play the same way. I love to wander the wasteland, slowly working through my quests, doing dailies and seeing what the gnomes and teddy bears are up to. There were plenty of challenging parts of the game, but having to fight off lvl 50 mole rats as i travel to my next destination shouldnt be one of them.
---
New skins for those guns would be nice but personally I find the solid color ones boring and uninspired. Imaging my dismay at the Halloween paint not showing up properly on the Fixer... Now I'm just stuck with one that someone took a sharpie marker to.
---
Ahhhh so really you want everyone to follow you
---
Yup, sadly a handful of people don’t realize yet that the only thing that really matters in Daily Ops is the time it takes to reach the objectives. The enemies aren’t even that great for experience compared to many others. I ignore enemies completely when on the move, just spam a few stimpacks and run like hell to the next objective. I completed the Blood Eagle Op solo a few times and that’s with my bloodied build main. Can’t remember if I hit Elder solo though, pretty sure the times I hit elder was with teams only. That 2x, 3x, 4x boost really helps if people actually keep an eye on the top right of their screen and stay within range of the uplink.
---
A welcome addition. Thanks. Becoming more user friendly than the last time.
---
So if i want to calculate damage from critical damage, is It possible? Same formula applies?
---
Maybe it's an unpopular opinion, but I feel like something needs to change with this.
---
I find finishing with Elder to be a real slog. So to have it pop up at the end and say "Reward: None", it feels like a slap in the face.
---
Riiight, that was one of my favorite pistols, all around super solid
---
Maybe a creative mode for building, who knows. I really enjoy camp building myself, it's fun. But surely, SURELY, it can't be as hard as people are making it out to be. I wasn't planning on doing a new character but Jeez I kind of want to see for myself.
---
Gotcha...shame it does not work like events or just 'fills' an op, but cheers for the reply.
---
Daily Ops
---
Honestly if someone did that to me I'd be pretty miffed, assuming I noticed in the first place lol. I only use private server to swap items around so I'm never on for very long, but I wouldn't appreciate some rando I've added to join without asking. I will have to check into the option others have mentioned to prevent this.
---
Camp in Flatwoods. Logged in to try out the update. Got killed by a farmhand outside the Ag. Went back to camp with a lot less ammo. Grahm was there. My turrets opened up on him. He went smashy on my camp, made a bee-line for my fusion generator. Logged out.
---
 I just want some fucking fun. Not working out a load of bullshit about perks and currencies and what the fuck. If that was fun for me I'd play the fucking stock market. I'm a filthy casual and I build pretty camps but nooooo... you need to grind ammo if you just want to go to the fucking shops.
---
That may have been how it was pitched but they’ve changed the language. We might be stuck with uplink for a long time though anyway.
---
No point in playing it now, especially with both the damage nerf &amp; one wasteland making all enemies stronger.
---
Oh I am using it.  But 2mm is a different beast than .50 cal.  A lot less bang for your buck.  I probably need to get my hands on a junkies .50.
---
i doubt they'd let any currently-live online games not work on a ps5 if they commited to having "99%" backwards compatability, even a controversially recieved game like 76.
---
I soloed that shit on level 40 died a lot but still won thank God I had incisor and I did this shit right before Sally hit my power. I think 26 minutes .
---
Had a bloodied sheepsquatch staff that went from 1048 to 431. Don’t really use melee much just when I want to save ammo, but that’s a huge downgrade.
---
Ace is the best! He gives you chems and booze. And talks smack.
---
I’ve never seen a traveling merchant in 76, only in 4. I’ll have to keep an eye out for that..
---
Do you need a recipe for making starches?
---
&gt;And how do you explain the presence of the Railway Rifle when the Railroad doesn’t exist yet?
---
The railroad did not invent the railway rifle...
---
There doesn't seem to be a level cap just slowly move your points around till you get where you want to be.
---
I agreee games been out long enough after doing it legit once you should have at least like a short cut path you can take skipping all/most or fighting
---
I agree with most of your post
---
To be fair though you can bypass the fusion repair by picking a lock and hacking a terminal to override the lockdown. And there are mainframe cores littering the place that you can just pick up to replace the burnt out ones. 
---
I understand the sentiment of your post though and as stated agree that if fixed, nuking will drop off
---
This is a really cool way to implement it, if they ever do it.
---
No way, y'all keep buying out my entire stock at once
---
Ooooooo the laer rifle or whatever it was, also the sonic emitter thingy for fun
---
It effects materials farming duration, this is why it will be fixed. Slow down the game play so people will grind more and log on more often, in my humble opinion.
---
Farming76
---
Well i wanna know if the tanker helmet is compatible with with gas masks
---
I disagree with you. I love going back to old areas and have it all be useful and exciting.
---
There's been an on and 9ff issue with enemy health bars "rubber banding" when they take dmg.  Not sure what is actualy causing it, but it can be frustrating.   I feel for ya man.
---
I ran my first one today, absolutely loved it! Made it to Paladin on the second run, and Elder on the third thanks to a lvl 40 who knew exactly what they were doing 😄
---
Congrats?
---
Seems to be tied to the healing factor mutation. I removed mine and suddenly didn’t have that problem anymore. I did put it back on though. The inconvenience is worth not dying constantly because I forgot to hit a stim. Now when I fast travel I will randomly end up somewhere completely different than intended so that is new.
---
wait. is it suppoused to be funny? i thought "soulless robot" was the point
---
I would just make it as often as you'd like, but you have to pay for it like borderlands
---
Yeah. That would be nice.  But then it would fully expose everything in a way they probably don’t want.  
---
But I’d argue that regardless.  This one aspect isn’t something we expect.  
---
Because bloodied doesn’t say ‘does c% more damage’.  Just that the weapon does more.  Same with stuff like 2sh.   And melee weapons just naturally do more with str.  
---
When you read a perk that says ‘weapon X does 20% more’.  You expect well. That weapon to do 20% more.  
---
If thAt weapon naturally does 125.  Then you expect to gain another 25 for 150 total.  
---
You don’t expect to look at it. And see it only went to 145.   Because you didn’t realize the base dmg was 100. And the 2s effect was making it 125 and the 20% is only from the base.  
---
Having 3 ‘weapon does 20% more’ perks become 60% vs .20 three times.  Is fine.  And can easily be logically figured out.  
---
But having hidden dmg perks that effect the weapon.  Suddenly not be included in ‘weapon does 20% more’ is confusing
---
Wait what?is stealth bad in daily ops?
---
No, I'm on PS3...
---
I only have 2 characters with one being Perception/Agility which is all Cammandos and Pistol build then I have a full Strength build which I can fit and shotgun, Melee and Heavy on. It's just a matter of swapping cards which gets really annoying.
---
Yup, pretty much. They want these Ops to be more like fast-paced raids than a sneaky take-your-time mission. I did just see that they’ll be introducing some new content that’s geared towards stealth builds though with less overall enemies.
---
You mean the one that by the nature of it's prefix turns into a standard plink-plink gun against anything close to a 'boss' you fight after the first shot? You aim for the stars there tiger, lol. In all seriousness the Gauss is the closest we have to a 'good' gun, and it is still behind good rifles of the same prefixes and massively behind automatic weapons. 44 and Western Revolvers? Utter weaksauce crap.
---
I like this update too.  Quit with your dumb ass conspiracy theories.
---
People aren’t vocal in here because they’ll be shouted down by the likes of you.
---
Exactly!! Making us waste more ammo doesn't make it "harder," it just makes it a chore.
---
Personally I’d be kinda mad if someone jumped into my private server without asking me first. My friends (actual friends that I talk to) will message me first asking how long I’m gonna be in the server so they can transfer stuff between toons. And generally if they message me first I really don’t mind and they can take their sweet time. 
---
I was mulling stuff between toons one day, so I was only gonna be on the server for about 3 minutes per character. Anyway, I got a message from someone who apparently added me a while back. I never added them as a friend, so I was confused as to how they got in my server. Regardless, the message they sent me was about how they were pissed off at me for leaving the server because they were transferring stuff and got booted (they didn’t have FO1st) and they lost a heap of 3* legos. My response was was simple, “I don’t know you, I didn’t invite you, you didn’t message me about using my private world for transferring, you didn’t ask how long I was gonna be in the private server, not my problem, but since I have access to the server still, tell where you left all these weapons so I can collect them.” I kept the weapons and blocked the leech. 
---
On another note, keep in mind some people want to play truly solo. My friend’s brother pays for 1st so he can play solo and enjoy the game like any other fallout game. My friend and I joined on him one day not realizing he was in a private and he got legitimately upset.
---
So I’d say send a message to whoever you plan on joining on first before just jumping into someone’s private world.
---
As soon as i saw that title i heard a "BA DUM TSS!" in my head.

Agreed. I would just mark this off as the OP is just a spoiled gamer that has too much time on their hands. Idk I just wonder why he's here complaining when he could be playing the game instead or shit even just teaching people. Funny enough time on reddit is time away from the beacons or whatever. There were times I screwed shit up as well on 76 and  this player base has taken the time to teach me instead of berating me, which I think is awesome. But there's always a few rotten eggs.
---
Ammo 1c each is pretty standard
---
Just tank the damage and sprint for the objectives.
---
Well at least it’s not taking your caps, loading you and then kicking you out of the server like it does for me
---
Same. I don’t plan on ditching rifleman but it’s sad that they’re really outshined by commando in almost every way
---
I’m actually pretty surprised they didn’t have stimpack and rad away ammo for the Syringer from the beginning! These are usually found in medical clinics anyway, so why not? Was hopeful when the game first dropped that I could be a long-range sniper healer, but this never came to fruition.
---
Stealth would have the same deal. Yes.  Since I’m sure where it says ‘does 2x’.  It’s really meaning now ‘adds 100% damage’.  Which will be from the base.  :(
---
Got a Level 50 Poweful Automatic Fixer that can't even last through Uranium Fever without breaking. It's rediculous.
---
Youtubers have tested them
---
Good resource, helps me to drop bloody mess without any regrets
---
Yes! I could not move last night, I was being attached by the following enemies, all level 43, which is my current level:
---
\- A Scorchedbeast  
---
\- Blood Ticks  
---
\- Blood Eagles  
---
\- Ghouls  
---
\- Super Mutants and Hounds  
---
\- Scorched  
---
\- Cultists

  What was weird was after I died and respawned I'd scope down to see if the enemies had dissipated, or vanished due to it being a possible glitch, and they would just stand there, like Ghouls in Fallout 4. Two seconds later I was being hit at all sides only to have to respawn agian. The give and take of damage received to damage dealt doesn't seem consistent.
---
  I'd like to see how much damage is dealt from a level (for example) 43 player to a level 43 NPC with a generic gun (shotguns seem to reign supreme), and how much damage is received to the same player from the same NPC. It *feels* way off. 
---
  (Personal rant, feel free to ignore) I was a huge advocate of 76, lore-wise I consider it the third-best FO title (following 2 and NV), and espoused as such online and to friends. I still think it's a great story and concept, but I can no longer recommend the game. Which sucks. FO2 was my first taste of FO and it seems 76 carried on that storytelling, if you will? I pre-ordered the game with the Power Armor helmet, still love that thing, but I am only a level 43. That should say something about the game (subjective). I was finally somewhat getting back into it, with the BoS coming back I wanted to level as much as I could, but I don't want to turn it back on now. And honestly, I probably won't. Guess I'll switch it up with my Switch. I am sure I will dip my toe back in once the BoS have returned, or if there is something sick drop Atoms on-- yes, I am a Fallout 1st sub. But other than that? It's a giant ball of frustration for a long (long {long \[long\]}) time fallout fan.
---
  Bethesda continues to say, "We make games we would want to play!" Maybe, perhaps then, they should make games *I* would want to play.
---
Fallout, after decades of fun, entertainment, and 3 and NV helping get through the most difficult time of my life, I must bid you Vale. 
---
Ave, true to the Retro.
---
You already got the answer of where to find ants but if you're looking for them to make Rad Ant Lager you should kill any you see randomly while playing with butcher's bounty on and build up a small stock of bottles in your stash just for when Biv asks for them. It's by far the most annoying to craft drink he asks for.
---
If I remember correctly there were also a bunch of ants during the Prime Cuts event in the Ash Heap during Meat Week. That'll be a good time to stock up when the second helping comes along soon.
---
literally just killed them fast. gauss shotgun. 1-3 shots. BOOWM!
---
Break their line of sight. use walls and pillars etc.
---
Ah, I placed my module in the Raider Hut that was in the Atom Shop a while back, looks like I'm forced to rebuild it if I can't find it. Thanks for the info...
---
Perhaps you need to evaluate your build. It used to take 1 shot
---
While we're on the subject of crits and surrounded by experts,
---
I've noticed that if I hold down Spacebar and LMB, I get far fewer critical damage numbers than if I burst-fire my weapon instead.  Is this just a flaw with damage numbers?  Or is it latency causing you to outpace the critical gain?
---
Someone did this to me last night...at my tinker bench just minding my own business making some .50 ammo when wammo! Some dude came in my camp and melted me. Thankfully I had just dumped my junk.
---
1. dont buy anything with caps right now .. you dont need to
---
2. hit the activate on wood logs on the ground for now until you find the spots that have alot of concrete bags to loot .. or build your camp on a concrete resource node .. you can use [this map rightchur](https://fo76map.com/) to find a resource spot near you
---
3. save all the ammo you pick up and loot from the ammo boxes and don't just use one gun .. use a hunting rifle(.308) or pipe bolt action(.308), combat rifle(.45) or the pipe revolver(.45), the board(2h) and you're good to go for a bunch of levels ... also shoot everything in the head OR shoot a limb until you hear a sound effect then another .. limb damage causes huge hp losses
---
Agree with this. You literally don’t have to fight any enemies until the end. Just have to eat 80,000 bullets while you huddle over the signal boosters. Just carry lots of stims and you will be fine.
---
Now I will say this. It’s hard too book it from A to B if you aren’t used to the locations yet. Especially the goddamn burrows. That place with robots in your face, is very difficult to navigate.
---
Sure, so have I, but considering I probably only died once or twice in the past six months because the game was so laughably easy, that isn’t saying a whole lot. 
---
It sounds like you should consider adjusting your playstyle. To me, the game is actually fun again, and I can see a lot of my old friends are playing again after becoming bored at the one-shot snooze-fest the game was before.
---
Almost all trash mobs now takes a full magazine (15/20 bullets). Before it took 2/4 bullets. Yep, I did the math in my brain too.
---
I got a AAE Combat Shotgun today. Can't remember the 3rd modifier but it might be nice for a Shotgun build.
---
The mutations will keep changing but they've said all Uplink daily ops will have the perception/sneak-proof mutation plus another. So for a chance at the enemies not having the sneak-proof one you have to wait for DOs that aren't the Uplink ones.
---
I personally think that it is a good thing to at least try to do the silo once "as it was meant to" but I agree with you. All the requirements to launch a nuke are a bit much. If they were to patch the phasing glitches, it would be good if the silos were altered so that upon completing the silos for the first time post-patch, you'd get a key to skip to the control room. Maybe have each silo have its own key? You'd think the silos are advanced enough that they wouldn't break apart every 3 hours. Afterall, they have systems to automatically reconstruct nukes in that time. For how long and all the trouble it takes to launch a nuke "properly", most people wouldn't want to run an event right after and not everyone has that kind of time.
---
I'm in PA Heavy Energy weapons and I'm hitting 8 minutes and a few irritating seconds.
---
So far I'm hiding around pillars and corners.
---
If you're in PA I suggest some kind of AP Regen
---
Ohhh that's more specific than what I know lol. I thought you wanted to see what the stuff looked like in game. This is someone else's video not mine. I'm sorry man.
---
No. I was doing the 79 raid. Those turrets killed me.
---
Yeah I'm with you. Can't imagine constantly being at the cap limit haha
---
i love the snarkiness of this lol
---
I was going to make the same post. Here's me arguement. The drawback for stealth armour is that it's one piece. So if it breaks in combat you have no armour also I can wear any helmet I want and still be invisible plus shouldnt it work like a stealth boy? I can wear what ever I want with a stealth boy. My build relies entirely on my stealh armour and I just hate getting these rare outfits and atom shop outfits and not being able to wear them
---
Right on, we’ll see how it goes I guess.
---
Just put a little thought into what you want to build, in the real world you don't get second chances. Just consider it forced roleplay by Bethesda
---
This was a problem pre patch too. Hardly any Nuke drops. We need them nukes.
---
Gotta check out survival shortcut legendary perk. There still the animation but they're practically super stimpacks with added benefits
---
You mean we need to put a minimal amount of thought and effort and adjust a little? BLASPHEMY! /s/
---
I'm on PC, but in Europe. It's felt about normal the last few evenings since the update. There's normally 3-4 public teams up when I log in, with Daily Op teams appearing and disappearing on top of that (those teams usually seem to disband once they've done one Op). And a decent number of people are turning up to events, usually about a dozen for the more popular ones like Feed The People or Line In The Sand, which is about what I was seeing before the update.
---
Yep, it's annoying as hell.
---
Thanks so much. This will probably work perfectly with the perks I've already chosen.
---
Ugh, not every one wants to be a sweaty tryhard all the time. What are you even talking about role-playing for. Your basically telling people they can only play the game one way, the meta way, YOUR WAY OR THE HIGHWAY. Not cool. Maybe you need to find a new game if you are not happy with this one.
---
It is kind of amazing they devoted a whole 20% to a kick in the balls like that.  Nothing like getting a fantastic clear time and then a "Rare Rewards: None."
---
But, these are the same people who think it's awesome that a 3\* enemy has a minimal chance of actually dropping a 3\* item.
---
I have a better acid spot for you. The top of tanagra town has about 10 cave crickets, which have acid. And hornwright testing site 3 has about 10 iron veins near the spawn. But even if there are good spots, it takes a lot of materials to keep the 50 cal going. My method needs more acid, since it's easier, but uses ore.
---
What? Remove those and it's no longer a Fallout game...
---
Yeah in most cases it's only 5-20 damage.
---
If you play a certain way, you can get close to getting the same results as a 2XP weekend.
---
I'm glad that you like it!
---
Yes I do think highly of the devs.  Speaking as a Dev myself.  Without even knowing the people who work there, I’m very sure they are super capable. Especially of minor things like changing a formula.  
---
But also speaking as a dev.  The issues that we are seeing?  Both software, balance, and more?   
---
Those are never the fault of the devs.  Those are all management/marketing/finance/etc decisions.   
---
The devs aren’t allowed to just go ‘fix this quickly’. Because it has to get passed up and down the chain and debated to death because if they changed the middle game and not have it be super hard.  Well then are enough people going to buy the repair kits for real money they they are selling..... and other such discussions.  
---
The devs can do anything.   Getting the managers convinced it’s a good idea is what’s important.  And why I’m posting this.
---
I play on PC, u/FrenklanRusvelti do you still need any help? If so feel free to pm me :)
---
I wondered why the legendary perk to do more damage when enemies attack you if you can't taunt.
---
So lets make the game overall easy for everyone for the ppl that don't wanna put the time in, got it! Edit Like the salt downvotes so good.
---
For sure.   I'm prepared to be wrong it just doesn't add up in my brain.  I'd still prefer a larger outdoor camp budget for the record
---
Have you tried protecting them? I’ve completed it with my lower level character a few times just fine.
---
Or better fight with them)
---
I’ll agree with that for *explosions*, but I die in 3 seconds to fire in Colossal, even though I take zero explosion damages otherwise (power armor with emergency protocols, and fireproof 3).
---
I mean the rare outfit is cool but I'm talking about people beating the top tier under the time requirements and then getting vendor /beginner plans or caps which is practically useless
---
All those guys have piercing gaze or something, I get bombarded no matter I stand or squat lol
---
People gonna bitch.
---
Maybe it was a "one-shot snooze-fest" for those that have ultra-optimized builds, but it never was for me. I'm a fairly casual player that just enjoys running around and whacking stuff with my super sledge. And even then, it took at least 5-10 hits to kill most mid- to high-level enemies. Now it feels like my super sledge doesn't even tickle enemies anymore.
---
For me It seems better, but I have a 40+ agi build, fixer and Full thorn armor.
---
However what concerns me the most is How stealth is broken in parties. You see your damage numbers as x but enemy tales Y. And Y is lower than X.
---
Theres a vídeo about It on the internet
---
Don't be
---
My bloody L45 lever action was doing 1100-1200 dmg headshots before and only 100-300 dmg headshots after. The nerf is ridiculous. Bethesda messed this up big time.
---
What is your build?
---
PA or Mutant slayer's Armor works well. Slap on medic pump or Born Survivor for extra safety. There are no resistances for players against freezing I know of. You'd probably need an Anti-armor high dps weapon at least (Junkies and TSE may even be better).
---
Already run that at max level, but don’t want to spam those due to I use them for food and water, so I do t have to carry any of those things
---
You’re certainly right about one thing, before the patch everybody was complaining about the game being too easy and not fun after a certain level lol
---
lol doubtful, I am and always will be a console pleb.
---
Well, they could just get rid of the whole enemies-plinking-away-at-your-house mechanic.
---
I mean, I don't see them randomly shooting buildings in Morgantown or Mononga, do you?
---
Shotguns got badly nerfed because of the armor high level mobs have. 
---
Single hit rifles kill in 3 -4 shots now, instead of one. 
---
Gunslinger build was quite bad before the nerf. Now, you don't even consider it.
---
Melee  builds got hit pretty hard, and they are almost impossible if you are not using stealth. 
---
Is it me, or, Bethesda only want players to use a Bloodied stealth commando build?
---
▪ First when you are a low level you have pretty much no material to craft ammo for sell and are looting nothing interesting for sell either. You can basically pretty much only make caps from quests and events.
---
▪ And if you happens to really just wanna take a break and build your camp and you have enough caps to fast-travel here and there, there are tons of resource farming videos on youtube. You can't miss them.
---
▪ And honestly when you are low lvl you go with the gun that has ammo or improove melee perk cards for your road to lvl 50. It's honestly the best strat if you have no main character over lvl 50 to throw you some stuff through a private server container. ( it's a lil trick you may learn later, don't bother with that )
---
Just play the game and try to focus on melee perk cards and may be some dmg and energy resistance perk cards, depending on how you feel. But definitely focus on melee perk cards. 
---
Later, once lvl 50, you'll be able to play a lil more with your build and move toward an other build if you want to. It will even be a big part of your endgame priority (activities )...learning the game and its available features.
---
Everyone is so mad about this “nerf” but I watched my buddies je plaz go from 291 pre nerd to 298 post nerf. It put bloody down where it should be and gives everything else a chance again. They fixed the game as far as I’m concerned
---
Maybe he thought he could stay forever and endlessly farm ammo. People are dumb, just ignore them.
---
I can confirm it drops Fixers too
---
How do you acquire the War Glaive? A second question I'm hoping you can answer, if you've completed daily ops once in under 8 minutes can you get rare rewards for repeating the op same day? (I ask coz I've done it 4 times tonight receiving 0 rare rewards).
---
i noticed this happening to me too when i was on last night! i thought it was bugged at first but all the enemies in the area i was in kept seemingly healing a bit after each shot.
---
I'm sure you can. My play time is very limited though, and I also don't need to grind levels haha. All the legendary perk cards I want leveled are maxed out already, and my build is solid. Its good for score, but I'm sure I'll finish in time anyway
---
Just do the other thing that gives them as well.
---
I suggested you test junkies to see for yourself
---
So, I'm gonna take a stab in the dark here and say that in its infancy, stealth might kinda break Ops. The concept has all enemies spawning and immediately seeing you to engage so there's... something to do.
---
People keep saying "Stealth commandos would like to play Ops" but as one of them, the fuck would be the point? After a week, most of us would be solo, escape artist-ing our way out of every moment to stand invisibly on top of the beacons while enemies deep around blindly. The only part we would have to engage is the boss, and all stealthbuffed out, it would be a breeze. Elder would be a snap, no matter the layoit/setup.
---
I suspect, once we have things other than up links, it might change.
---
I mean, I really don’t think the damage change is that bad. I HAVE noticed I’m doing less damage with my AAE handmade, but I’m still killing most enemies relatively quickly. 
---
I think the main thing is that people are just too used to doing ridiculous damage so they’re complaining, and other people aren’t doing enough damage now because they aren’t built or don’t have any decent legendaries
---
Honestly vampires is doing me pretty good. I did a daily Ops yesterday with the Vampire minigun in I never got below 75% health.  What's your build?
---
They spawn in project paradise too. But it’s not always easy to get a shot in or loot their body with all the chaos going on.
---
Theres ants with rats, are one of 3 possible spawns in the asylum too. On the left side, opposite side of the ghouls. Sometimes those rat fuckers kill them first though
---
Str let's you do melee,  shotguns and heavies
---
I really feel bad for the people who yeeted their coins into perks they didn't understand.
---
I got the elder rank at 7 mins 10 seconds with just me and my boyfriend. But yeah it would go ALOT smoother if everyone just ran to the objectives and THEN cleared the enemies.
---
Agreed. When the cars blew up performance blew up.
---
I leveled up 12 times and I'm pretty high level.  It's insane
---
Did you do the daily op yesterday?
---
Some morally depraved ne'er-do-well killed me the other night when I was building a bathroom for my new CAMP. Can't even shit in peace in the Wasteland.
---
this is happened to an extent on a new character I created just yesterday after taking a break from the game for awhile
---
I shoot something in the head and it's down from 100% to 10-15% health(this is all under level 20 btw) then I shoot it again in the head .. and it's now down to 5-10% health .. like wtf that shot should have killed it, then the 3rd shot and it goes from half health to a quarter health like my client was never updated or the server decided to give me durability loss, but negate any damage I did and bring the creature back to half health
---
very frustrating to say the least
---
I've chosen my main weapons on the basis of how quickly the ArmCo machine produces ammo for them.
---
Sure, Daily Ops can leave you in the green when it comes to ammo, but it would be nice if they incorporated just a touch of that dynamic ammo system into general overworld spawns.  The game doesn't have a good symmetry between what enemies use against you versus what you use against them.
---
Totally agreed, ammo factory is a must for heavy gunners. Not all events reward players with excess ammo, in fact most don’t. I just did Rad Rumble and used a lot of ammo, glowing ghouls don’t drop anything for my weapons.
---
Agreed on this.  This is one of those things where it doesn't matter to me because I move base locations all the time lol.  Honestly the camp size is big enough in overall diameter, but I know people want more more more.  But, we all know Bethesda has never had an issue with forcing people out of their virtual homes before so I could totally see it happening.
---
Yes, I think that if you reread my post you'll see that I mentioned Tanagra Town near the bottom...  (grin)
---
Lucky Hole mine used to have Cave Crickets as a random spawn until they replaced them with the cultists....
---
Sounds good 👍
---
Whenever I drink, use a stimpack or get rads. Was told it could be because I've 100 legendaries in my inv
---
Maybe if you had bloodied junkies exploding two shot whatever. If you had average okay legendaries and the proper perk card alignment and mutations though, 4-5. I refuse to spend more than an hour online researching spreadsheets of percentages for a game. And I don’t want to play bloodied because of if have to run to check on my kid it is too easy to die. Really, I hate hearing “evaluate your build” anymore because to me it is just saying “minmax the game”. You should not have to. But either way, 2-3 shots was okay before... when you could do a couple school runs to grind plastic.... but when even getting plastic required significant shells?  Idk man. I will try again once they fix the “people can steal from your inventory though your shop” bug but I am not excited. Shotguns needed love before, still do. Maybe if I finish grinding faction rep and can get the tesla shot...
---
I once fought a supermutant in Fallout 4 with a wounding (bleed damage) minigun. It took me 10 or so goes to beat him.
---
Well I would not call it 'caterwauling' ......I try to see my own bias and be as constructive as possible. Mind you it is so long since I heard anyone use that word that it made me smile anyway.  I did not realise that the starting experience I had was not always the starting experience. I am quite prepared to accept that because I had a week or so pre patch I am judging the new experience far more harshly than I might have done otherwise. Having said that I don't think anyone can deny that the disparity between the two might be a shock to the system. I thought I was playing one thing and ended up playing something that feels entirely different. I'm keeping on at it but it is undeniably more frustrating than before.
---
If you look at how much more ammo is needed to defeat enemies now, Betheada really should have given all players the ability to put an ammo factory in their camp.
---
Just had it happen when I visited a friends CAMP was able to take all her nuclear keycards. It didn’t have a price I noticed
---
I personally like stealth sniper.  Don't worry too much at the moment about the 8 Charisma.  You can move points later.  Stack up on Agility and Perception for now if you go stealth sniper.   I am solo too, but always join a public team for the benefits.  Very useful when you get mutations.  There's a perk card and mutation that makes everything better in a team.  You can also level up faster with 3 inspirational on a team.  
---
Edit: I never play my 1st character, so starting over is an option.  If starting over, one way is get points where you want regardless of the cards.  Then when the cards are available, you have the points in the right place.
---
Yeah no prob.if you change your mind p.m me..in 5 more levels I have a level 35 aa handmade that should get me to level 50 pretty easily I hope but I'm holding on to that low level stuff in case I make another alt or some one could use it
---
Standard armor Unyielding set and trouble shooters, all I have. I may then try PA, I've that ultracite one, never used it.
---
I run full Unyielding, 30+ AGI, full Sneak perk, etc. The day before the patch, I could meander lazily through a mob of ghouls but now they get mad if I get near them, and super mad if I start stealthily picking them off.
---
Everytime I've completed it the rare rewards section states "none". 4 times tonight, but the first time did it in about 9 minutes.
---
Nah.  Every other world wide game like this has a universal reset time regardless of your timezone, and it works.  You get used to when it is real quick.
---
But this 20 hours after you do each individual task is nuts, for all the reasons you said
---
They definitely had that coming. I feel like it's one thing to join with the intention of spending caps and then bouncing, but I'd never join to farm materials or do my own business of any sort.
---
Why are we getting rid of food and drink penalties? If you don't like them, then go play any other game that's not Fallout...
---
My door in game is always open to the homies :))
---
Knowing this game they would accidentally set everyone back to level one
---
I will try not to worry about it – but boy it triggers the perfectionist in me!
---
You’d still have to do the same thing with packs tho
---
Why so angry for?
---
Yes PLEASE! I've only had her in my camp for 3 days and I already want to change ally again.
---
I remember toward the end of PTS, there was a bug floating around that no one really explained or acknowledged where certain enemies (mainly Super Mutants with energy weapons) could just flat-out kill you in one shot.  Like, they had to be doing abnormal damage on their end to cut past the player's armor and all their HP.
---
It wouldn't surprise me if that's still a thing.
---
You still have to scrap it but it won't be deleted. That was changed a few patches ago I think.
---
Neither.  You have a dupe to either level up, or scrap as you wish.
---
I'm fine with the changes but they need to fix the bugs that the game has had for years instead of making the game harder
---
Then they'd fight each other over the coat
---
Are you sharing a perk card that messes with other people's builds?
---
Yeah I don't research shit and bloodied/aa shotties and melee weps are a dime a dozen in people's shops. I still have some 1/2 star ones in my shop
---
Haha, sounds like you *are* my type. ;P
---
I appreciate that.
---
Thanks, I rebound between bloodied unyielding and full health troubleshooter armor, build wise, selection of handmade and my new vampire's gauss shotgun.
---
It's this freezing that locks me up, will try hiding more and born survivor, never used that before 👍
---
FaLlOuT 76 Is NoT a MmO, guss there making it a mmo now
---
I love how everyone complained about one shotting things, and now they whine that the game is too hard for them. Hahaha
---
All it needs is just one to stagger you and your done
---
Don't really have a real build but I was focusing heavily on strength and endurance with a melee shotgun combo
---
Never, that would make too much sense.
---
I’m a paying customer. Go play 3 for the 18 bazillionth time if you want survival elements.
---
Yeah. The damage perks are useless too. Why would I spend 3 perk points for a 10~ point increase on a 300+ hit? It’s kind of nice though because you still do great damage to every enemy, except the huge bosses, and this frees up a ton of perk points for more defensive oriented perks. The compromise I’m planing on making is replacing the unarmed damage perk with Bear Arms (I have a flamer I use too) and using a magic mini for ACP and SE. 
---
I would also like to point out, with a full set of unyielding (that’s only 15 extra Strength), I gained about 100 damage per swipe . I want to max out the legendary strength perk for an extra 5 (on top of a 15 base Strength) but I need to test and see how much damage that would result in. I plan on testing it on Monday. (If someone wants to test this, just unequip Radicool and compare. Also, try an enemy with armor and without armor like a Super Mutant and a ghoul.)
---
I knew this would be first legendary card I would get and I did and I maxed it out right away. I def don’t regret it. I made sure to keep my scrapper card to so when I get low on steel I’ll make a run through the map and get all weapons from enemies and scrap. I should never run out of anything other then maybe acid.
---
I did One Violent Night yesterday. I let the Nightstalker run around for 15 minutes while I killed wave after wave of the new, stronger ghouls. The XP was flowing like crazy.
---
Neither. You get the card
---
I was just telling my wife the same thing lots of 45 to 50 in age range we got frozen out by this last update.
---
If I do not like, they won't either. And we are not a small community of Old head like I like to call our selves.. just realized that we Are  BIGGER community than what I thought. We have been changing with the times that video games have fundamentally change . We started playing with joystick and one button (atari) evolution of video games has been nothing more than chores no real content. Had 1000 of customization for free with certain video game. Whatever happened to smoothly playing games. You can't run in 76 without getting caught by a pebble.. or Ghost gut punch???A pebble ? Ghost punch? who thought of not making the game fluid? All is gone in favor of this monatization strategy with subpar and unfinished buggy messes that this games have become.
---
They seriously screwed up the fun on this last update.
---
Not really.  They are purely melee enemies.  As long as you can put height and/or distance between you and them, they can't lay a paw on you.
---
Eh, I tried out a new character and just joined a couple of daily ops to get ammo. Also, there's seems to be a lot more ammo for sale in vendors, at least from what I've seen.
---
The main issue I saw for low level players, is that enemies don't seem to scale when you're around higher level players. In the open world, I would encounter lvl 40-60 enemies when there were a high level player in the area, and the same in the daily ops. When I was by myself, the enemies scaled to mine, regardless of where I was. I thought this was exactly what OW was supposed to get rid off...
---
I have a vampire's gauss shotgun still getting used to it and 3rd party view,  it's OK when it doesn't lock me up with that non reload non sprint bug. The freezing seems debilitating in this Ops.
---
I used to take a hour of play to level up now I can do two WhiteSprings runs and get a level I love it but I’m only doing it to rank up my legendary perks cuz this season looks poo
---
Got Elder yesterday with no rare rewards but today got 2
---
Put yourself in someone that played pistols, or a builder's shoes or an explorer or traders or roleplayers shoes. Even fighters who never was lucky enough like us the get instigating or TSE weapons for their character. Surely you can see it's a problem for them?
---
I have never run an ultra optimized build and the game was insanely easy before. I’m sorry that you don’t like it, but I find the challenge extremely refreshing. 
---
Also, it’s not good reddiquette to downdoot people you’re replying to over something silly like this.
---
Hmm so let's see, actually looking at the perks and making a decent build is tryhard, ok. I love this game, idk where you're getting that from. And hello, this dude is running around with a broadsider and commie whacker complaining he can't kill anything. There's more then 1 meta. Everything you said is wrong and you fall into the category of the players im talking about. I fart in your general direction.
---
So, in PA without bloodied or junkie, and not dying and killing just fine. What am I then?
---
to bad you got rattle bones and now your bullets magically do 25% less damage.
---
AA is a debuff on the enemy, rather than a damage buff to you (which all got nerfed). So yeah, that's why it's become ungodly good all of a sudden.
---
I just finished it thanks to a low level that sped up the uplink connection. He died a ton.
---
RIP my hero.
---
Thank you for listening. It really is appreciated.
---
Lol. I always loved that when they would just destroy you with the legendary they equipped. Explosive or Wounding assault rifles wrecked me at least a few times too.
---
I think I'm dawdling too long then I need to get moving. The final boss was brutal, constantly crippling me, eventually killed it.. wow! hard.
---
Tea Time has a similar problem. The pipes are way too fragile and I still don't understand why we can't repair them.
---
I agree with you. I stopped playing after I finished the last season. I was only logging in to do the score challenges not because the game was fun. I actually have to try now which is a nice change. Now they just gotta clean up some bugs....
---
It’s not hard to get tech data and turn it in.
---
Or if Legendary corpses retained the green aura until you collected your loot, that'd be a huge QoL improvement, too.
---
Thanks for the info, I’ve been playing around with my build for the last few days and I’m one-shotting level 50 scorched with ease without any buffs!
---
Weirdly though, cars need 5 shots to explode...
---
Nice 😊
---
Of course my melee madlad! Got respect for those that brawl. Never been me but without you i get spotted! 0.o lol
---
Are you ps4 because i could always use a brawler in the mix! I run team medic constant too! (I also share 2* inspirational cause imma boss is all) :D
---
Oh and apparently there is a sneak ops in the works so thatll be my turn to be shiney!
---
I'm not the one downvoting you, but thanks for assuming I'm that petty.
---
Yeah if you stopped playing at level 16 you didn't see a lot of the game. As it is now, I can take two maybe three hits from a level 100 ghoul before I'm dead. If I can't get out of their reach for long enough to pump enough bullets into them, I'm dead. And if I kill that one before he gets me, his friends definitely will. I fought off a scortchbeast last night that took well over 1,000 rounds of .50 cal from an explosive machine gun with maxed demolition perk and 20% damage boost from heavy gunner cards. Actually, I had to finish it off with my explosive handmade because I ran out of ammo for the .50 cal.
---
It wasn't that hard, just annoying and tedious, and a huge cost in ammo. I was lucky that it was in Watoga where the robots were distracting it, though not doing any damage, that I could take my time and wear it's health down enough to kill it. So was it difficult? No, not really, like I said annoying more than anything, now I have no ammo for my .50 cal and I have to spend time making new so I can maybe do a daily op which I still have yet to do, because, hey you guessed it, I don't have the ammo. Supposedly you get ammo from those events, really the only reason I want to do them.
---
My suggestion early on is to build on an area that has a junk pile and do the scrap bot.  It’s an easy and passive way to get junk items.  
---
Water purifiers are a good way to make coins.
---
How is it a massive chore exactly?  I barely farm anymore and have more scrap than I'll ever need.  I rarely farm for food yet keep all the best (plant-based) foods on me and use them regularly.  Perks like Green Thumb and Scrapper are vital to farming things effectively also.  I went from running out of steel constantly for .50 cal rounds to having over 4k steel (and growing) literally just from using the Scrapper perk.  The only things I ever have to farm anymore are flux materials, and I don't even need them for anything but Ultracite ammo now.  A big part of this game is getting yourself to a point of self-suffiency so you can do whatever you want, whenever you want.  This is made even easier now with legendary perks.
---
And I know that Fallout games aren't really known for their difficulty, but I feel like this same crowd would complain about how hard Deathclaws were in the other games.
---
Truth is, this game has been badly balanced for a long time and the no-skill crowd has had it waaaaay easier than they should have for a long time and have become accustomed to being able to play the game with no thought or effort.  If that's what you want, I suggest movies as an alternative to video games.
---
Most are, though if you want to use energy, avoid grounded with a passion. iirc the damage loss from it is like 50%
---
I got kicked for not reviving the team leader.  He was outside the circle dammit
---
i dunno, im oneshotting most things, and if i dont oneshot i usually kill em on the second one with my executioners one :D
---
What kind of build do you play? I repair my armor once maybe every two months
---
im really glad to see this. i havent played my main since one wasteland dropped, ive been playing my noob toon exclusively. i was afraid i was just really bad at making a melee/commando build (my main is a stealth rifleman) but im starting to think the game just became really unbalanced. im absolutely amazed at how often my armor and weapons break, and im constantly switching between guns because im tearing through ammo so fast. im level 25 and toxic valley is still brutal at times. also, i still run into level 50 enemies??? idk if thats supposed to happen, but its annoying me that my own damn regions are fucking my shit up.
---
Also, you can no longer receive single rank perk cards (like Scrapper) in perk card packs.
---
It’s not a theory , it’s a damn fact shown over and over again for a year plus now. 
---
I love how you people will literally try anything to get people to not see the truth, but it’s pretty damn obvious tbh.
---
Okay there are too many things wrong with what you write...
---
First of all did you read my post at all?
---
Second the JE Gatling Plasma got not stronger because it's a Junkie weapon, no it got stronger because it's a legacy explosive weapon. My legacy Quad Explosive Harppon gun does 1400 damage "putting junkie down where it should be".
---
Bloodied is still stronger then junkie always has and probably always be. But because the damage calculation was changed the gap is shrinking.
---
I've 15 legendary junkie weapon and about 25 bloodied. I don't care when bloodied will be obsolete someday. I'll always have good weapon regardless of the legendary effect.
---
Yes, ideally you want all players to stand on the control point for faster captures, but it's not required if you optimize your time.
---
most people take everything except carni/herbi-vore which you can only have 1 of..
---
IMO the penalties arent great enough to force people to pick and choose..
---
personally I only use Grounded, Marsupial and Eagle Eyes
---
ohyeah you create way less bullets per lead right?
---
If you want action place a camp by BOS alpha camp and the watoga trainyard. It was fun before the update. It’s blatant suicide now.
---
Same, I maxed it out first thing too without thinking twice, crafting is so painful in this game, the less the merrier.
---
Did you miss “don’t want to play bloody because kids “? Whatever man. Git Gud I guess right?
---
Sure, but you'd only need to cash in 4 cards instead of 9, and the game could be coded to let you choose between 8 coins or the card pack.
---
I simply see it as another puzzle we have to solve.
---
One Wasteland made the enemies stronger and damage buff made all players weaker. This is the worst possible combo. Bethesda, you have no excuse. This update is killing the game for a lot of players.
---
No, your just a fan boi. 
---
I can take that, even when I disagree with you because it’s 10090% better than a shitty shill account from a crap company trying to scam me.
---
Ah I see. Thank you for the insight
---
Hi! We know that lots of you had a blast with Mischief Night last year (we did, too!) We love this event and how it brought the community together to raise a little mayhem at the Whitespring. However, there are still some outstanding bugs from last time, and so it's not currently on the schedule for this year. We are discussing having another event in its place so that you can still celebrate Halloween in Appalachia with your fellow Dwellers.
---
Let it all go 🎵 let it all go!
---
Its a game padawan..... Be still :)
---
Very good point!
---
Technically the alternative dialogs are the specific SPECIAL level checks such as needing 8 charisma
---
Nothing wrong with that but never say never. I used to mostly play on console too. 
---
I still want to see your Gary camp. I'll show you mine if you show me yours. https://youtu.be/69UishHAjfs
---
All good - quest is done. Found an ant just sitting outside the teapot. Event wasn't running
---
I was looking for a static, non event spawn, though i know most of the answers were for an event or to the location I've already tried. Nonetheless, it seems Teapot is sometimes a static spawn!
---
I saw that. That's why im worried.
---
Ya they hit the nail it n the head with that one.  I just like my apocalypse to be jovial!
---
Isn’t it like broken right now where you can’t drop nukes or something?
---
i dont think so. repairs your weapons when hit
---
&gt; for a week or two before patch 22 there was a bug with nuke codes so people couldn't launch anything.
---
It was only bugged for like a day
---
sneak crits never worked for me in vats. i honestly thought that was intentional.
---

 &gt; Hi! We know that lots of you had a blast with Mischief Night last year (we did, too!) We love this event and how it brought the community together to ...
---
In point of fact, you can't stealth.  There are two modifiers, Piercing Gaze is always one of them. Enemies know exactly where you are at all times. You are always in [DANGER].
---
ps4
---
Possibly they changed how being the one to aggro an enemy works too? Just a hypothesis with the addition of the taking one for the team legendary perk.
---
I died buying from a player vendor. A liberator basically one shot me.
---
I'm level 28 now and kind of end up wherever the questline takes me. I have just finished the innoculation quest at Foundation and Crater so I have been around those areas mostly. 
---
I am mostly fine if there are only two or three enemies but any more than that and it all goes to the proverbial.  I am having to get up close and personal as well which is not a natural thing for me in any game .....I very much prefer ranged. However my ammo drains way way faster than I can get resources to make more so I am back to the trusty old fireaxe. I don't find that natural or comfortable so maybe that is having an impact on how I am seeing things too. I am just hoping I find a way through 'this bit' and figure out something that works for me within the confines of the new system. Thanks for the encouragement too .....very much appreciated.
---
i don’t know what you’re talking about I got a BE .50 too and i was going to run out of regular .50 before I primed it again and I’ve been shredding things most things I can 3-4 shot idk what you’ve done to yours but the .50 is still amazing I do see the rubber banding health thing especially in daily ops but it’s just visually for me
---
maybe i dont know how to join.   i just join the daily ops team and get booted.  dont even get to start the event
---
bloodied melee got hit pretty hard
---
using gun fu and adrenaline?
---
Yeah that one is awful, even with class freak it's a -12% debuff or something like that. No thanks.
---
Idk bro I just kill mole rats and get it lmao
---
As someone who hasn't played in probably a year (because life circumstances) in that time have they 1, buffed laser weapons yet and 2, can you use the lmg now or is 308 still impossible to find in the quantities needed and can't be crafted by the 100s?
---
Game still easy asf. But I love this update, now we can PvP almost anyone and destroy their camps in adventure mode just like a real Wasteland, thanks to a broken legendary card.
---
I got liquid courage 2 days in a row, yay for getting rare reward, but...  also liquid courage requires Earle's vocal tumor thing to craft, but it makes you immune to his fear...not sure for how long
---
So, as a person that has several hundred hours in the game, starting a new character is still moderately challenging for you? I feel like thats a good metric right there. God help the people that just got the game 3 weeks ago.
---
well if you're not specced for rifles it's gonna suck and blow
---
Restart your game. Same thing happened to me
---
Lol.  Oh jeez dude.  Quit playing the game already.  Do something more constructive with your life buddy.
---
Deathclaws are still easy, it's the swarming scorched and mole rats insta killing people in power armor.
---
you probably wouldnt like the game now anyway.. lol
---
-sry I couldnt help it..
---
naw yo.. its working good as it ever did for me on PC.. and Im pretty much running it on a toaster with a 3dcard.. lol
---
Ive only played a couple sessions over the last 2 datys.. but disconnects havent been one of my issues...
---
should have herd and empath in this age of public teams tbh
---
I've now been in a server on with two accounts continually for about 3 hours, but I do get periods with frequent CTD and sever disconnects, just seems random.
---
Public servers do seem less stable, private worlds better, anecdotal only.
---
Not that then but if there is anything else you are able to share that increases damage or something it may help.  Otherwise I don't know.  Joined a team earlier and showed up a few minutes late to the op without getting kicked.  There was also a level 80 something and we all did it together.  Sounds like you are just getting paired up with dicks unfortunately.
---
Depends... If you have a Level 50 Anti-Armor Fixer with exploding bullets and are spec'd for a Rifle Build, then yeah, it's good.
---
Berkeley springs
---
+1
---
Is true before the path I kill queen, colosus or encrypted solo in few second, but rigth now the Base damage of melee weapons need revise, now the melee character is my worst build
---
Others covered your questions.
---
I just want to say, be careful afking in workshops even if you dont own it. If your in the build zone and someone contests or claims it, they can kill you, pacifist wont save you.
---
Same thing if you walk into a worshop while it is bring contested or claimed. You will see a red or green wall outlining the build zone if it is.
---
Yup.  Its my own fault though, these are the weapons I have chosen.
---
Berkley Springs Train Station
---
Someone dropped one last night. Right on fissure prime.
---
Where Purveyor used to be. I guess they figured he was better suited there
---
Whatever man I’m not debating with you. I suggested you test junkies and you got all defensive. I don’t care to talk with you anymore please don’t reply
---
I was spec'd for unarmed sneak melee. I went from doing 2-3000 a swing with stealth headshots to 2-300 last night with a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet. I swapped to instigating midway through the robot challenge on the first day of daily ops. The high strength from unyielding still works well but bloodied melee weapons don't seem that worthwhile now to me.
---
Lone Wanderer yo.. I only team when required for dailies
---
I don't know what you're paying for, but I'm paying for a Fallout game. It's a post-apocalyptic survival game. This is how it's supposed to be.
---
Nothing here, after 3 Elders.
---
Looks like I'll be buying all the rewards again, as usual.
---
Ah, wait, full VATS gunslinger build by chance?
---
But what if I only wanted to scrap 3/4 they would have to keep both methods in
---
True, if you have plague Walker mutation, it does remove all diseases so be careful
---
That would be nice. I'd like to apply skins from the season to my Solor Armor as it's the only Scout Armor Set I have.
---
I ran it solo 3-4 times this morning with the following setup:
---
. Bloodied at 19% health
---
. PA+Emergency Protocols
---
. VE Gatling Gun (used 90% of the time)
---
. BE Gatling Gun
---
I consistently complete the op in slightly more than 8 minutes.
---
I have not been able to get to Elder solo yet but I rarely die.
---
Edit: I tried the Blood Eagle Daily Op with a solo Bloodied Commando toon last night and got my ass handed to me due to the overwhelming constant enemy spawns. This morning, changing strategy paid off with a tanky load out.
---
Why can't I just be a fan? Is the word boi supposed to imply a low level of maturity, youth or lack of personal accomplishment? 
---
What do you call those who just post negatively and act as if they have run more successful gaming companies than Bethesda themselves?
---
Easy. Use flame trap to destroy it, then get something small and then out plushies on top and repair the sympto
---
Thank you for this information, it is very useful. I haven’t been playing this game all that long, and I see there is a lot to learn here. The first time I played after the update, I was level 48 and I was suddenly getting smashed by everything while doing negligible damage to enemies and burning through all my ammo to no effect. I was greatly disheartened and thought the game was broken. Then I went to work the next day and when I came back, everything seemed somewhat back to normal again. Bullets were doing reasonable damage and I wasn’t getting steamrolled anymore. If it wasn’t for everyone else on here having the same complaints, I would have thought I must have been tripping or something...
---
I’m still learning new things about the game every day, so this kind of information helps me a lot. I didn’t even know about all the mutations you all have on you until I asked someone in my camp how he was jumping so high. This morning I finished getting the relevant perks and luck points and gave myself 9 mutations. I didn’t get a chance to see how those bonuses will effect combat yet though. And I didn’t have these extra bonuses at the time I experienced the update craziness, so it seemed to fix itself in under a day without any significant change to my stats or equipment. Maybe I’m just going crazy, but I went from being convinced the game was ruined back to normal enjoyable gameplay like it was just a bad dream. I mean that first day a lone super mutant crushed my communist bunker and killed me outright while I stood inside it before I could get out of build mode. It took me almost 2000 rounds to fend off a wave of mole rats attacking my workshop, and when I tried the daily op I was beaten down so fast I couldn’t even access the ladder to get out in time...to the point where I just dashboarded and quit the game. Last night I sat down to play and was fully anticipating more of that insanity, but it was a pleasant surprise to find that something must have changed.
---
I did take ammo factory, I would've liked to take another legendary perk, but was left with little choice.
---
I believe you get the card. I would suggest not scrapping the duplicate immediately but maxing it first. IIRC, higher rank card give more perk coins.
---
Build a terminal and it will tell you where to find the quest.
---
Me too sir :)
---
Like everyone else here, this update has left me not wanting to play, at a point where you should be having us excited to get into a new season, so this update is a huge mistep that's going to cost you in player retention long term. Like everyone else, as a level 38 player I was just starting to foray into new harder areas and enemies, and have been forced to just give up doing anything because the in game cost and stress of playing now is too much. I'm not here for survival murder mode, nor are most players.
---
However, I don't think the fix is a long way away from what you have - the core issue looks like the fact you're always level matching (and assume stuff your own level is expected to be "easy", but in practice isn't because of resistances, aggression, and health scaling). Scale the match percentage down from 1 to something like 0.5, and see how that fares as a brute force trial, then you can look at a more subtle alogrithm for how you bring things up for high level players by region, etc.
---
Just please, if you want to keep us, communicate those plans soon, and quickly. Don't overpromise, but don't leave us with the impression nothing is going to happen this season because someone is too scared to admit that mistakes were made.
---
Yeah, probably the same here. No problem doing it the "normal" way but, quite frankly, it's just incredibly boring and the rewards don't really justify doing it the legit way. 
---
Giving us a shortcut to the launch room once we've cleared all 3 silos should really be a thing.
---
The cameras one of those untradable things. If you want to find the guy the dead guy that has it use the camp terminal.
---
Hmm, will have to check, could swear we were on a timer from the moment we got started.  If not, I see how it could add up to more exp, but man, would I have to bring a ton of ammo.
---
Vertical half walls!!! We’ve got horizontal, now give us vertical! I wanna make a closet, I wanna make a room that isn’t a square, etc etc.
---
Stairs that aren’t trash. Allow me to put a door wall at the top and bottom of a set of stairs. Oh man, so many stair problems.
---
Ladders! Gimme a ladder, I wanna make a treehouse. They took away all the floating camp bugs. I want to be able to do a pridwin and a treehouse guddammit.
---
It was a top rated build prior to the One Wasteland?
---
This was actually a refreshing, unexpected question, OP.
---
Twitch streamer Medic noticed about a 65% dps drop in his DCG if I remember, fighting the strangle heart, if across the board that's a huge drop in output.
---
With enemies now scaling things have really been balanced across the map for players. More chems and foods?
---
Make special sentry mobs that are immune to stealth. They guard crossroads in the maps so you have to fight them to advance, without the benefit of stealth.  If you don't kill them within X seconds they got an alarm similar to Blood Eagle outposts.  Or as soon as they see you, they take off deeper into the map, making loud noises that alert other enemies.
---
Make the space near the control point illuminated so you can't stealth and all within it. Sure someone can hang out outside of the area in stelth but it will take twice as long for it to tick up, making it impossible to get good rewards. They have to kill everything from stealth then hangout in the non-stealth area until enough mobs spawn and push them away from it to clear house again.
---
Not EVERYTHING has to see through stealth to make it challenging. Just enough to make the player have to be smart about prioritizing targets. It's far less challenging for me to just put on Power Armor, equip my melee weapon, and just spam power attacks and stimpaks to victory.
---
As a bloodied vats build I feel almost no change to my damage output, I know it’s less, but it still feels strong enough for me.
---
And the only enemies that kill me are still commando gutsys, assaultrons, and yogi bears
---
People sad their OP build is shit now lol
---
I got elder on my very first OP. Thanks to a friend.
---
Sounds like a controller malfunction.  Tried a different controller?
---
I had the exploding guys yesterday. Today I have freezing super mutants. It was NOT fun.
---
Yup! That was my favorite Op so far. Explosions everywhere. I just decided rather than have that effect all the time, I wanted more luck perk points for Ricochet so swapped out the card.
---
What a bullshit smarmy post. People are railing against the massive increase in difficulty but you worded your post to make it sound like no big deal
---
ah yeah if i want humor i'll go with raider or santatron lol
---
those 2 are better than lone wanderer though. Up to +3 to all specials plus less damage. Works even solo in a team
---
I like the game. However, I can't seem to get to my quests because I run into too high levels baddies. I'm level 20. Someone told me to just farm. Once I have enough supplies, to go for it. Any other tips? EDIT: turns out I'm only level 13. Got my wires crossed
---
First daily ops was quite difficult but today with human opponents is really easy - I done solo without any problems. Just make sure you understand objectives - you don't have to kill everyone, just create unlink. Really easy
---
So what I'm gathering from this is what I feared, that such a build needs bloodied weapons, but they got hella nerfed. I saw a lot of posts how bloodied took a big hit.

With max strength, full set of unyielding, and Radicool, you’ll do great damage to almost all enemies. You will be completely and utterly useless against Queen and Earl though. If you’re willing to play with a minigun (carry weight and ammo) I have a magic minigun for you. This will allow you to be viable, if not good, against either of the biggies. I play Xbox btw.
---
no thanks
---
like in the fractured steel update in the winter?
---
Yes it's generally a good gun. However on the basis you can't remember where you got it, you may have got a level 30 one as a quest reward, which may be why it's doing so little damage. For some reason that quest always gives a level 30 fixer regardless of what level you complete it.
---
yes, 2 shots maybe 3 to fill my crit meter and a ccrit to the chest oneshots everythinng anyways
---
I can never start over on this game. I played 4 hours every day for two years to get to level 50
---
I'm just happy to hear that someone ran the SBQ fight. I haven't seen one since 22 hit.
---
If you weren't playing Survival Mode then you weren't playing actual Fallout
---
Noted. Thank you
---
You don't have time to hide
---
I didn't just make it up because i am sad t""t in need of some attention ?
---
Its alright, i think im just gonna take a break till the hotfix, thank u so much for the offer tho!
---
I've noticed this too. Thought it was just the server I was on (it happens), but server hopping didn't produce any better results.
---
I noticed that on tea time as well. I think it should be repairable too.
---
Return of the cazador
---
I am heavy VATS user. Reflex are not what they used to  of a 20 yr old. I use vats even to kill fireflies hehe... Fixer are completely useless. Useless have 2 of those things
---
Yeah, it's really not that bad at all.
---
I take only a small amount of damage from the fire at ACP or encryptid and I’m in T-65 with 1 rank of fireproof
---
Thanks again for the amazing feedback!
---
Headshot are double the damage which is shown in your pitboy.
---
And sneak should stlll do 2-2.5 your normal damage. But I didn't test it.
---
Thank you, kindly!
---
All people have ever done is complain about this game. Be honest for five seconds. Lol
---
This is not a bug. Its an intended mechanic.. According to people around here "You knew what you were getting into by taking the workshop." Now this might apply to not just workshops but it doesn't matter because "You knew what you were getting into by purchasing this game." 
---
I'm waiting for a few people to show up here and spew their nonsense and defend the pvp in this game.
---
Alright I appreciate it !
---
I got around it by completing that part on a private server.
---
Yes, that's right, YOU HAVE TO PAY MORE MONEY to Bethesda for Fallout 1st if you really want to advance.
---
:(
---
The special cards say you max at 15, so I don't think you can go the extra 5 ...
---
&gt;fuck mireluck kings
---
cannot say that enough.  even at my level 472 ass.  one is a pain but if you encounter a pack of them, fuck man, they are bastards.  its fun.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think Bethesda was personally targeting you.
---
I was cautiously exploring the Mire a few days ago and a dead Scorchbeast suddenly dropped out of the sky on top of me. Scared the hell out of me!
---
This +1
---
If you have *ranked up* all the cards for a given perk say 1\*, 2\*, 3\* commando and you get another single from that perk tree from a pack, afaik you lose that one.
---
I have made sure now I have space for all possible cards I may get from packs, I have 20 packs now to open when I get around to it.
---
sir/madam, please set aside your panties and get your build together, having a decent build has nothing to do with meta or whatever. you having a messy and unviable build is your problem, not being able to kill level 60 scorched is your problem. quit bitching and just make a good build
---
Where is this world going to if a wastelander can’t poop in peace.
---
I've been Messing around with my level 21 with a non Legendary hunting rifle and I'm having no problems fighting Super Mutants, ghouls, bugs, and the raiders and I'm rocking a food build. So I can't find a problem with it.
---
Bloodbugs and Stingwings are terrifying again.
---
Lever action needs a buff. Hunting rifle needs a HUGE buff, like 2x the damage, and Radium rifle could use some love.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to take away my osmosis kit.
---
I wish the ammo from daily ops goes str8 to inventory too...
---
Hahah don’t know how many time I hit E to trigger “I see you’ve found our missing equipment”.
---
What hotfix? I haven’t seen a mention of one.
---
All these kids whining about not one shotting everything should use the time instead to get decent at the game. Bitching because you have to actually play and not just push your iwin button.
---
Thanks for that Mate.
---
Sometimes i dont know why people bother replying,just to call people liars etc.
---
I have a Bloodied black powder Rifle that still kills in one shot with Chems etc.
---
Just seems to be my explosive 50 Cal.
---
It happened occasionally before the update,but now it is really bad.
---
Used to use versus Gatling Guns (Mutant Slayer's, etc.) but they are now weaker than AA and too slow for the spongy enemies so now I mainly run Final Word or F10 Prime 50 Cal.
---
Gun Fu 1\* and adrenaline 5\* at the moment, I've been messing like crazy with my card build and the legendary cards.
---
Pls no
---
When the Radstags hunt you!
---
So I get 2 Scrappers? It's a 1 star card.
---
got 3 back to back to back last night. went smooooooooth
---
With those mutations and Inspirational you get +25% DR and +15%XP. Not to mention the extra xp, ap, etc from the stats gained. And with the extra perk point, I can run Strange in Numbers for even more benefit.
---
\[edit\] Also the int bonus from casual teams. I love lone wanderer, but there's no reason not to team up anymore.
---
Thank you. I appreciate the advice
---
I like how the development team has had a year to work on it and but the thought process is to just shelf existing content and throw something together last minute. Wonder how buggy this replacement will be.
---
Before Patch 22 I didn't really have any issue utilising Sneak attacks in VATS.
---
But now it literally does not work,
---
It's actually a very fundamental part of the entire Fallout franchise, 
---
It's definitely a bug that'll need looking into because it's not only making Sneak/Crit builds completely redundant, it's removing a very important part of the Fallout Franchise.
---
I wish that both jukeboxes would be able to cycle through the stations. I want appalachia radio on my jukebox ffs.
---
The Fixer is currently the best rifle.
---
It has Mods to either make it a Automatic or Semi-Automatic weapon, fitting both Commando and Rifleman playstyles.
---
Even non-legendary version have a stealth buff, so getting a 3\* version essentially gives you a 4\* legendary weapon.
---
With One Wasteland, there are more "good" legendary versions now, I suggest trying for an AntiArmor/Bloodied/Junkie/Furious Legendary.
---
But all that only counts if you wanna play with Rifles, obviously.  
---
The plan: The Fixer is needed to unlock both the higher level versions, as well as unlocking the Fixer in your "legendary item drop pool" (you get no legendary fixer drops without the plan)
---
I did it solo on my pvt server, full uny with 3 sentinel pieces, I managed 8' 30 unfortunately, the last boss killed me once
---
Other than doing like 29 base hit on Earl/queen with melee, I love it. One shotting enemies isn’t fun and neither are level 5 enemies.
---
While I might agree for the most part, Mole rats at level 100 are now more deadly than Scorchbeasts 😆
---
That seems to be true, I was trying to harvest the ammo drops but I think that has to be done at the end fast like in the Earl event or not at all.
---
Is that true though? A splitter doesn’t turn laser weapons into shotguns. It turns them into rifles with 5 shots per trigger pull
---
👍🏼
---
It looks like something is causing an issue for a few of us.
---
I wonder what the problem could be ?
---
I am wondering if it is some sort of damage Cap.
---
Todd noticed u/Phobos95 didn’t renew their fo1st membership and had to release the robothugs to rough him up
---
Yeah it is.   Level 35 and its basically broken for my play style.  Was just starting to get into it as well.     Wake me if they ever fix it, I'll be sleeping in my CAMP (playing other games).
---
Thank you, and yeah sounds good. Send me an friend request at diamond_dimer_2 and I’ll accept it when I get home from work.
---
Personally, I'm planning to go junkies now but keeping my health low enough for at least +2 unyielding and +5 radicool.
---
I was doing WesTek at 40.  I don't use a meta either.  You have range to get away I don't.  The difference is, you uncloak it's time to run.  I uncloak and I'm in the middle of them.  Nowhere to go.
---
We aren't going to agree on this, enjoy your game and I'll do the same, whether here or somewhere else.
---
I haven’t seen one since earl came out... and yet earl is the worse fight of the 2, no repair kits and less flux rewards.
---
Is does not, just activates pip-boy light. Sorry bro
---
If you nuke it, they will come.
---
"WHO'S READY TO GET THEIR ASS KICKED??"
---
I did a Yao guai horde a few months back. Holy shit balls. I counted 16 level 42 guai.
---
L45 bloodied lever action was doing 1000-1200 dmg headshots. Now it's only doing 100-300. That's a rediculosly huge reduction, and combined with the higher level enemies all over the place now, it's like a slap in the face from Bethesda.
---
No, they definitely weren't. But you'd think that after two years, maybe, *just maybe,* they'd learn that some of us like to keep pets at our CAMPs for longer than whatever timing interval decides when your camp gets attacked next by the single most powerful basic enemy type in the game at a level that should not be possible in the starting area.
---
damn that sounds awesome.
---
You guys even do any testing on it before you released it?
---
Off topic, but do you happen to know if the healing effect works for public teammates? I try to occasionally check, but it's hard to tell in the heat of battle.
---
Ya I’ve been doing them for the repair kits, my armor is breaking crazy fast now
---
Hahahaha a little different than the current posts. I am a level 35 only started playing about 2 weeks ago and am really enjoying the game but am so far begins in terms of content. Still haven’t even really done a Wastelanders quest. So much to still explore and do.
---
You had me for a second with the first few lines of your response. I was about to burn your upvotes at the stake. Luckily I am a pretty sarcastic responder so I got you.
---
I’m with you on this, went for a run in the cranberry bog to see what difference my heavy gunner health power armour build would have since the new update, was pleasantly surprised.
---
Thanks for the info, good to know bloodied is possible then, I'm in unyielding at the moment but will give PA a go I think.
---
My new main gun is a vampire's gauss shotgun so that may work for me, it's pretty unstable though.
---
these people were at their camps - not a workshop - try reading the post before defending PVP man.
---
Edit: misread jasonking00 - but the comment stands for anyone else trying to defend PVP when the player isn't interested in doing it.
---
They let you fast travel? I swear I got luck of 1. Each time I’m trying to fast travel I get like a pack of 10 on me. Thank god for mysterious savior and power armor reboot.
---
Milk takes away rads, and I want to say nuka cola grape does as well. They don’t remove mutations.
---
You can also get a friend who has SG to share it with you.
---
Also on PC. No disconnects at all.
---
I reckon leave it for now and get starched genes, marsupial is worth having and it won’t take long to level at the moment, just hop into a couple of events in a public team and you’ll be sorted
---
Any non auto weapon needs a buff. Crossbows, pistols,  missile launchers,  etc
---
Bro those numbers and your still complaining it’s a dmg nerf of course your dmg will be lower 😂😂
---
IIRC, Brahmin Milk removes Rads without removing mutations.  Nuka Grape as well, but that’s harder to get. 
---
Go to Flatwoods to milk the Brahmin, and set up your own Brahmin Pen at your camp. The milk spoils, so use it first and save the Nuke Grape for later.
---
It’s a ongoing game. Of course new, better stuff comes out over time and things change. People should definitely not play ‘live service’ games if you don’t want new progression.
---
I would understand this being something that could be randomly applied as a challenge, but removing the viability of sneak damage bonuses and sneak crits is tough... but not unplayable. I am a sneak-based build and while it sucks not getting my damage bonuses in the Daily Ops, I still have good enough damage that I can help kill stuff with my team.
---
The daily ops are more about moving quickly and controlling the signal boosters than anything else. The final enemy wave and boss mob are really the ONLY thing you absolutely have to kill, the rest it's best to just run and gun, trying to avoid taking damage while sitting close to the boosters.
---
I'd love to see them roll back a little of the anti-sneak stuff, but at the end of the day it won't really be that much of a difference for how I approach the Daily Ops.
---
[Valseek responded to a couple of threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iu0gbn/coming_from_a_midlevel_casual_player_onewasteland/g5m5i1r/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) about the mid level difficulties and said theyre working on a hotfix for it
---
I guarantee the Brotherhood is gonna move in somewhere.  It’ll be interesting to see what they do with them.
---
You do, you just can’t equip more perk cards. It would strictly be for more damage.
---
Are you sure you pulled stable flux from the bag?   If so, there has been a change with this patch.  Flux always disappears if you die after the Queen dies....or at least it has for the last year.
---
Okay, okay, I get it. People ain't allowed to complain about issues with Fallout 76. I'll keep that in mind the next time I decide to post.
---
If you're using Fallout 1st you can drop items in your Private server, then log on the next character and pick them up from the ground.
---
I would like to:
---
* tweak the build area without having to move my C.A.M.P.
---
* have more junk items, chem containers and trinkets that I can populate my shelves with. 
---
* buy locked items with atoms in the build menu irrespective of whether they're available in the atom shop or not at the time. 
---
* plant cranberries and any other consumables that grow in the wild. 
---
* banisters for upper floors with a stair case to match. 
---
* clean toilets, bathtubs and mirrors. 
---
* a post-war Sanctuary build set would be awesome!
---
* a flue piece to connect to the chiminea fire that clips through the roof. 
---
* hexagonal/triangle foundation pieces. 
---
* half walls 
---
* interior corners that are flush at the joints... it bugs me to no end that a slither of wall is missing where the two walls meet!
---
A couple of people have been able to confirm it now so that really sucks man. I’ve taken all my vendors down
---
I finished 16 seconds under 8 minutes and literally just ran from point to point, doing nothing else.
---
So what? Yes you get two and need to scrap one.
---
Pipe is life!!
---
Last thing I need is more script, already just toss it away by purchasing legendary modules daily which I just throw in the stash box.
---
It's a curse when one has obtained their ultimate weapon, no need for anything else.
---
Could improve my armor, but no need really, my vampire, explosive, .50 makes me nigh unlikable as long as there is something to shoot.
---
One thing great about the robots in the daily OPs is even though their hps might be a sliver, I could still leech life out of them like they were a scorch queen, it was great.
---
You’ll enjoy , did it a few times. Noticed that the first 2 things when you wait for the bar to fill goes much quicker when your all very close by to it and not off chasing kills
---
Typical BGS. Create an event that nobody can seriously solo to force a fan base that likes single player to team up.
---
People don’t know what the fuck to do yet, they’ll figure it out. 
---
Maybe I give them too much credit...
---
10 Level 100 Yao gui Aren’t fun in tight spaces like a porta-potty. Especially when your wearing x-01 jet pack. My game still won’t work.
---
Can’t drop/trade them
---
I’ll try this. Thank you
---
My pet got killed by a Yao guai attack yesterday, felt bad but guess what chief pets have never lasted long pre or post patch 
---
You literally kept your Deathclaw in a cage where it wouldn’t be able to defend itself from ranged attackers and then it died firing squad style, u could have made ur walls out of foundations and they never woulda got in- have some foresight
---
Happy birthday 🥳👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍
---
Maybe is a problem because you using a mix power armor? I use full set of ultracite and I'm more than happy. Is quite difficult obtain a mod or plans but till I get t65, ultracite is my everyday power armor 
---
Also check your perks. I'm sure you can find power armor builds online
---
I’m 12 levels away
---
You’re just dumb
---
Settlements in FO4 followed the outline of the area, not nessecerily square, although they were all strait liney, but yeah thats what i mean, i dont see a problem with them being circles in this so for me its would be an un nessecary change but im not gonna lose any sleep over it
---
Beefy..... You gonna take this one?
---
I'm assuming sarcasm isn't your first language. My response must have hit home for you huh? You must be one of those pvp weenies.
---
The signs are uncommon rewards but show up in the rare reward section. I got the signs and the disease cure machine on the first day.
---
All this makes me not want to load the game up again. Despite my best efforts, I only made tier 84 or so on the Legendary Run. I found that so grindy, boring, repetitive and annoying, I just couldn't face doing it all over again, even if they have re-jigged the weeklies or whatever, for those players with a little less gaming time available than others. So, I've not even looked at this new season. Instead, I found myself going back to No Man's Sky for a change of scene. Another grindy, buggy game with a rocky launch, but well... a change is as good as a rest, so they say...  Sometimes I do wonder why we spend our evenings grinding on games after doing the work Grind all day. I need some more episodes of The Mandalorian and The Witcher to watch. Maybe I'll just go back to Netflix, and deff the grindy gaming completely. Disengage my brain for a bit. Sometimes I do question whether I am actually enjoying playing grindy games, or whether it is just another chore, like filling &amp; emptying the dishwasher, or cleaning out the rabbits hutch. I need escapism, not more grind.
---
Haha maxed out level and weapons in new Vegas and I still gave those things a wide birth..
---
Interesting, thank you.  I'll run the numbers again with this info but they still don't look right.
---
I've never tamed an animal and I'm pretty much too dead inside to bother with it, but my current CAMP location was meticulously chosing in large part due to it being nowhere near enemy spawn points.
---
Your welcome pm me if you need any more help also take your time and do side quests it makes the game more fun happy hunting
---
tse is one of the best for damage. the mighty angryturtle said so.
---
If you think range makes that big a difference in the wing of West Tek, whatever. I can’t fix “woah is me” people who blow things out of proportion and try to say they need 30 levels to fix your build.
---
Really seems this game isn’t for you
---
It shows that this is a lot of people's first MMO lite experience. 
---
The meta changed, now you've got to play catch up lol it's how these things work. Don't worry in a month or 2 you'll be 1 shotting everything again.
---
Yeah. I was confused as to why something dropped flux because I'd thought it went straight into your inventory after killing the queen. It hit me when I looked again at what the flux was sitting in and saw it was a loot bag.
---
The Queen was downed outside the nuke zone, if that makes a difference. I know all your junk stays with you if you die in a nuke zone.
---
There is a nuka grape in a tnt dome. Server hop to get more
---
I gave up long ago from having pets. I can have the safest forest camp in the world. I literally kept the camp for like a month before I got a pet to see if I got spawns and I never did. Got a pet - next day randomly had a bunch of liberators roll thru and murder my Deathclaw. It’s just not worth the time you have to sink into it to tame. 5 hours to find a deathclaw so in the event he actually makes it back to your camp- he dies in 5 minutes -_-
---
If the event has been completed it'll drop to the ground, if the event is still going all of your junk will stay in your inventory.
---
One morning one week before patch 22 another player and I saw 5 SBQ events started one after another. I heard on a discord that someone figured out the nuke code encryption or something like that, so Bethesda had to stop nukes from working for a while while they changed it.
---
My buddy died yesterday and was ticked because he thought he lost it, but he said the flux was in his bag
---
Completely agree, from a fellow casual player!
---
Love the signs, i got those yesterday
---
Jetpack, buttressed, deep pocketed is what I have.
---
I would definitely go for heavy power armor
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f144e7b&amp;d=s22sx2sb2sg2sq0s30sr0pe0eh2eu0c62ce0ic4s12ip2ir2s72a12l71lg2lt2lu2a70
---
Yeah done the same to mine. I’d advise anyone to do same if they read this. Not worth the risk
---
I perfectly agree. 100 rounds from a short gattling.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
3 days, 3 Elder tiers, NO REWARDS. Rip me.
---
I’d keep it and just let yourself die, it will heal about 25% of the rads. I did this for one of my characters up until I could grab SG. See if you can get adrenal Reaction to go along with it.
---
Cool! I can't wait to check it out! One of my teachers in high school had one, it was really neat.
---
Doesn't matter if you pick a location far from enemy spawns, which I did. Camp attacks will still happen.
---
Jetpack is worth getting next? I have 1200 gold, saving up, and I'm torn btw getting the jetpack or another limb.
---
Who said you can’t complain?  He made a little joke about the situation. He didn’t personally attack you. 
---
*Unlike Todd Howard who has just sent another wave of Resilient Freezing General Gutsies to your doorstep...*
---
You're welcome.
---
I have not tried using my Gauss shotty during Ops yet, but I my experience, as long as you free-aim the weapon instead of using VATS, you'll be fine. 
---
My next experiment will be with my Bloodied and Vampire Gauss miniguns to see if reducing the time to kill the final boss makes a difference in reaching the Elder tier.
---
how do I get onto a team doing a daily op? I've been doing them solo.
---
Lucky!
---
So as a stealth build I guess I shouldn't even bother with daily ops then?
---
I need a guide to understand the legendary perk cards... and then someone to explain that guide to me,  twice...
---
He plays a Patch 22 build
---
Take it that sniper build has been needed into the ground?
---
you bet your sweet ass I am...
---
(clears throat)
---
But you risk lagging and losing it, don't you?
---
What perk you are you picking for #6?
---
No, still take a ton of rads. Even with rad shield on top of that.
---
Rad suit, power armor, and stealth suit all have a hidden 90% rad reduction on top of high rad resist.
---
Hmm, that could explain the multiple drops people are getting.
---
Yeah, and in the frat house. I’ve got a few dozen saved up, but never needed to use them personally.
---
Sounds awesome that you all play together! I’ve been trying to get my partner to play, he’s a gamer too, but he has less time than me and is put off by all the issues the game has :( it’s good I can play with my bestie tho! Our first MMO too!
---
They changed it so you don’t lose it now. I had maxed out blocker and got 70 more of them with my unused level ups to scrap.
---
You can open the packs and not worry about it
---
Your fans adore you. Your* forever our dumbass
---
So one shot headies are fine as long as you use the built in aimbot?
---
Not having teammates to speed up the uplinks makes it razor thin.
---
Yeah. The game is still not overly difficult.
---
Well making posts about them on here is a surefire way to get them patched...
---
Alright, if you still need any help after still feel free to pm me and I will try to help if I can
---
I used to do 24 damage with a head shot on the Scorched Queen and 10-20 on Earle, before I "enhanced" my character for One Wasteland.  Did Earle earlier and my damage was 28-38, and I've upgraded my Zealots Plasma Cannon to ultrasite ammo and was doing 72 on a headshot in close range on the Queen, numbers I have never seen before but it din't seem the fight was any easier or harder, but it was a lot more fun.
---
Seriously, I love the daily ops.
---
assultrons and the puffy boi charred ferals are the ones that strike terror in my heart. they rush you SO FAST.
---
Could be the team is holding that slot for a friend.  Probably not personal.  Just pick another team or hop servers.
---
This. This sub is so full of "wouldn't it be nice if we had x" but nobody considers what Beth/Zen can actually do with the engine they are running on. Just think of the logistics of this. I saw a post yesterday with a guy doing a page worth of math just on how perk coins would be calculated. Add bugs and generally Creation Engine weirdness to it and you have a several month-long "sorry, we gave you your perk cards and SPECIAL points back, but it appears the patch left some players out and now all ghouls are invincible" fiasco on your hands.
---
Not to mention the flood of complaints that "I didn't need a respec, now I have to sit here and redo all this!". I love FO76 and the community 90% of the time, but that other 10% is just socially distraught individuals that want their fantasy escape to be exactly how they want it without considering reality, and it's equally frustrating and sad.
---
The new music plays when near the Top of the World as well. Not sure if that's a bug or if the BoS are going to be expanding out or what.
---
Either way, I'm camped near there, and my camp just got some spiffy new music.
---
Cool cool
---
Played FO4 for about same amount of time 1900 hrs I enjoyed the hell out of it. With survival mode mods added. 76 we did change or adapted to this wastelanders because we discovered is a different game than FO4. Which was MMO part of it. Not the rest. But what many don't understand is that even if we didn't want to be part of this MMO we still participate. All of us at one point or another were part of teams to achieve goals we needed and have some fun.
---
What is been trying to be said is that it's been misinterpreted as been hard. Most of us can deal with it. But are we going to? I'm not in the bandwagon of let me restart to make my character Godmode. If I wanted I would have had it that way already. So in essence option has been removed and force has been established. And most of don't like to be forced into something that we didn't care for. You wanted to be Godmode amen God bless. But why you have to bash us that don't want to be like Mike? We are petulant, Winny. I do believe that this game was taken to current state by the very whinnying of ppl saying I want a challenge Its to easy. If they can create NW they can create option to go to world were you can have your enemies spawn at 1000 level and have all of the fun you want without affecting my fun...what you want we were not interested in that..Not interested in your build, we can figure this out in our.we did.... That's the problem.
---
I would get it first, yeah. Get it out of the way and make the grind for treasury notes a little easier.
---
Yeah I added legendary luck so I can run blocker, dodgy, serendipity and ricochet maxed out. Love it
---
No problem.  Check this out too if you haven’t. 
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
If you click “hide all” then scroll down to junk - you can see the nodes in the Forest area (assuming that’s where you are).  Lead is also a good resource as you’ll need it for ammo.
---
Nice of them to tell us , when they moved mumbles I spent days going to her old spot and thought she was on lockdown
---
Given how organized they are (well, now, pre reclamation they were a fucking mess.) I imagine their take over will be less than subtle. Best case scenario they are the ones helping people settle back into such hostile landscapes and worst case they piss off MODUS or start getting a little too handsy with the land. 
---
Personally given what has interested me most about the game I am very interested in what they are gonna do with: The mothman, the interloper, and the mysterious Rok bird that is skewered on the side of a mountain in the savage divide.
---
The existence of all 3 is extremely foreboding personally.
---
Yup but people will also go on to say that there isn’t a need to change the engine
---
This is why I wish I had a gaming crew to pal around with, I wouldn’t have to try to switch my build out to solo the ops or just skip them all together. Being able to coordinate tactics and have builds that compliment one another would make these ops a walk in the park. Sadly Radworms are my only constant travelling companion and they don’t help much in a firefight.
---
apparently too many people play the wrong way
---
if you have a rifle you put card that boost your rifle damage there.
---
if you are melee you put points in strength and use melee cards
---
if you are using 15 points in charisma with useless cards or running faster using less ap well.. go ahead and enjoy killing nothing, it's called common sense.
---
Just because it's fallout doesn't mean you don't know the basic of what an rpg do.
---
Melee build with a Full set of butressed and deep pocketed.
---
Also shielded SS underarmor.
---
Rolled WR on all pieces, plus Chameleon+ AP regen on one, mutants (+10% dmg) + 25RR on another.
---
Gives me 400 DR, 300 ER, and with what rads2, about 400 RR.
---
Beefy Trout... the official dumbass of /r/fo76
---
No, it's just that tanking hits always works, stealth doesn't always
---
We have been asking for a DECENT respec option since like December 2018.
---
What does the jet pack use for power?
---
Hmmm, interesting 🤔
---
Yeah a few hours ago I saw the weapon in a YouTube video and it has another skin, which is similar to the new skin of the Whistle in the dark
---
It kind of looks like a toy with red and yellow stripes all over the blade.
---
I use the jetpack and buttressed on my unyielding chest. The jetpack is great fun for mobility and everyday running around. 
---
I have another bolstering that I have setup buttressed with asbestos for Earle.
---
Simple, I like that!
---
I've gotten two rare drops in one run
---
Do you know which type has the biggest radius? I think the biggest boom would be effective lmao
---
I really hope so! Or at least tone it right down!
---
just make the item red if i cant build it. please.
---
If they had said they we redesigning the event to move it away from Whitesprings I could see the justification, blaming bugs is just kind of adding fuel to the fire at this point.
---
I don’t mind seeing the event reworked or replaced, but this isn’t the way to announce it.
---
I love this update, no more under leveled legendaries makes me happy 😊
---
Wait, so it's a bug? I knew it! I've been missing all 5 of my Gauss Rifle VATS hits at 95%+ accuracy and it's bloody infuriating. I've gone to trying to shoot targets manually instead because I'm tired of wasting ammo.
---
From what range? Are we talk about at max range or close to max range, or inside West-Tek range? 
---
What damage cards do you have equipped and what are the displayed damage numbers on your vats crit kills?
---
Shotguns.i blow them away real quick with either combat shotty or my guass shotty.no problem.im lvl 213.
---
I'm fairly certain that your private server is always the same instance, I've personally never tried dropping an item, quitting the game and then seeing if it's still there on the other character. Let me test that for you with a Purified Water right now.
---
Sounds like it works very well for the build!
---
I still think savage Mirelurk kings need nerfs! Literally two shot me last night in power armor while spamming stimpaks
---
Issachar2018, I thought I was the only one.
---
You should not have to spend 4K caps.  
---
Most players that sell serums do so between 250 and 500 caps.

I feel ya. My character is built for speed so I am always finding myself 1st to the beacons. Most people have figured out to follow as quickly as possible though. 
---
Managed to get one under 6 min today.
---
you aren't better that anyone for paying money in the game.
---
go read a guide how to play the game before buying atoms.
---
Ask a friend
---
Yao guai are easy pickins with a shotgun.a magic shotgun.😉
---
AP. Drains pretty quick, but definitely worth it when used wisely.
---
I have plans to do the same. I wish we could decide camp music.
---
I run Lone Wanderer
---
I’m a chinese SS sniper and this update ruined me. Good thing I have commando perk cards all bought ;)
---
Or you could just watch AngryTurtle's video, he explains what you need to do pretty well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaTj9OdaVAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaTj9OdaVAg)
---
Yeah. I've seen it in action on my friends, we always use a public team for events.
---
Thx!
---
Stop being a little bitch and attacking OP. He can voice his opinion now stop attacking his. Go play fallout 4 if you want to play by yourself. Damn you people are annoying.
---
We finished the OP today in 6 minutes because we had a well balanced team. 2 long range and me with my magic shotgun to finish off any stragglers. If you ever need a teammate on Xbox I’m usually on from 4pm to 5pm EST.
---
Yeah, the first day made it seem like MAYBE they were something I'd have to work a little harder at to hit Elder reliably, but it turns out that was a fluke combining basically the three worst things, Resilient + Robots + Burrows.  The past two days have been a cake walk.
---
&gt; You don't have to be hardcore to assign perk cards. Rifle cards are for rifles, pistol cards are for pistols etc so on and so forth.
---
YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
also my 3 cards for running faster with less ap are more important!!
---
/s
---
If you learn the plan they get added to what can drop as a legendary for you , small chance of plan from completing the fake sheepsquach or look on the trading site that shall never be spoken of - which has a very similar name to this one coincidently, players who already learned it normally sell for 5-10k caps
---
I'm very mixed on the new patch I never been one to jump on the bandwagon as bashing Bethesda however this new patch I believe is causing a problem and they should be held accountable for it there are people that will say that it's not the game's fault it's that our bills are badd however our builds haven't changed in the last 21 months when they were deemed to be the medha or to be OP and now all of a sudden after the patch our builds are incorrect I don't believe that's true 1 point that I'll bring up as I believe but there's the knew that it was going to be an issue and that's why they gave the Mo factory park to where instead of making a 100 bullets we now make almost a 1000 bullets because they knew exactly what was going to happen I'm all for up scaling things but I think the problem is is that mobs got a buff where we the players got unearthed Now I'm not saying that I'm gonna start crying and quit the game that will never happen I love the game I love the community I love the story lines I've gone into doing so many of the side quest now because I just can't get enough of it because I love it so much the biggest thing is that people need to understand of you need to re learn how to play the game don't go getting rid of all of your perk cards don't go trashing guns you have to learn possibly a new place style I loved being a heavy gun power armor and running into a Room and demolishing everything with my 50 cow now I can't do that I have to be a little bit more survival style and outweigh the cons with the pros as far as do I really need to bring in that many stim packs because now I have to carry around a few extra 1000 rounds a 50 Cal
---
currently im more scared of teleporting molerats than deathclaws lol
---
Among Us does have ads on the free version though, fortunately they are super non-intrusive
---
I guarantee MODUS is gonna have a bone to pick with them moving in on his turf.
---
I’m thinking they’re going to be less than benevolent honestly.  The West Coast Chapters were always jerks compared to the East Coast Chapter.
---
Rok bird on the Savage Divide?  Where.  And the Interloper still gives me chills.  Hopefully he stays buried.
---
Just wondering about the % do you think finishing a daily op at paladin tier first for the 10% chance THEN finish an elder run for an 80%? Would this increase our chances of getting rare loot?
---
Every day you get a different one afaik
---
That's outside the scope of building changes... I don't know. I assume you're talking about destroying camps with them? It was slated it be fixed, so maybe.
---
 Yeah missed it
---
Going against everyone here.. get dense to start with for the chest..
---
Frees up perks spaces as you won’t need fireproof,
---
Then get Asbestos for a spare chest piece for fighting Earle 
---
Once you have a full set then get the jack pack ..
---
I had it and it was great for a while but found dense was more useful day to day
---
Snap
---
Dang, thanks dude. There are static death claw spawns at the island and power plant right? Hmmm...
---
I found this video on Aligned vs. Stabilized vs. True (read his comments on the video ... the video is all his testing) ... net was I switched my shotguns to True Stock / True Barrel (in fact all my single shots) and I find the spread GREATLY reduced and now have some range. I usually pull out the shotgun in the club house and have fun with it.  
---
[Aligned vs. Stabilized vs. True](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2l8WVEHrmo)
---
Lol. It’s new and we’re all still getting used to it. Angry Turtle has some pretty good videos on them on YouTube.
---
Only crazies ask and answer there own questions.
---
Trust me i asked facebook.
---
Thank you for this info.great job.
---
You must be afk to be killed by a molerat
---
Next time try fast travel some where near. I find if I can't travel to where I want the closest place near where I want to go I can. Straight away weird.
---
Ads aren't microtransactions tho
---
That’s a good question I know steam and Bethesda store use the same saves.
---
Exactly! 100%! Such a waste of ammo and scrap! It’s going to outweigh the farming, so what’s the point!
---
My melee character will probably never take Thorn off! Unless they somehow manage to release another set of armour that buffs melee even more.
---
Shhhhhh, dont say that it will get nerfed. Some cry baby who doesn't get a god roll over doing it 2x is going to complain.
---
Just play the game and buy it in a vendor for 100-300 caps later.
---
Love you bethesda!
---
I imagine the horses would be great, but even I’m scared I would be pulverized especially with the resilient mutation.
---
BE lever is a joke right now, that is for sure. I just switched to BE Tesla to just shot the ground for AoE damage.
---
AA did take a hit. I run AA and I have to two or three shot literally every mob now. Since the update, I’ve had 2 one-shot kills, and that’s cuz the mob attacked me first, prompting Take One for the Team.
---
I am gonna make some tweaks to my weapon mods and try stacking some cards differently.... but yeah, AA took a hit.
---
Oh no! Sick bastards LOL
---
Really want them to add some unique locations for it. Really wanna see the early Pitt, and 76 could be an absolute dream for seeing the games we know and love at an earlier time.
---
bullets in the face
---
Awesome. Thanks for the info! 😊
---
I don't have much issue with my rifleman. It's my bow guy that suffers.
---
Sucks because I traded away a furious vats optimized handmade for it
---
If this is a secondary character and your main is 50+, you could try throwing on the What Rads legendary perk.
---
I've noticed recently some enemies, instead of going meat pile when npc bodies get too high in count, they'll sometimes appear as loot bags... Noticed this a bit in Uranium Fever...
---
The new supply run lmao
---
still not an argument
---
PA mods sell sometimes ie calibrated shocks
---
That’s not correct.  You pick based on your build.  Having all of them is counter productive, I tried 😂
---
Aww, I play ps4. But yeah, I like shooting with the heavy weapons, also. In fact, after the patch, I dare say, more. I guess I'll give this build a try to completion with the unyielding, first. I just saw a note about being able to ground the queen during combat, though?
---
1. Access to the plans for the Ammunition Construction Appliance requires Ally status with the Raiders. 
---
2. Ally status requires starting the Faction questlines, which has a minimum level requirement of 20. So people under 20 can't start this.
---
3. To be an Ally with the Raiders, you'll need to grind the Daily raider quests. The max reputation bonus on each quest is about +200. You'll need +12,000 reputation points to become an Ally, or roughly 60 daily quests. So you're looking at a grind time of about 2 months. 
---
4. Once you get your Ally reputation, you still need to buy the plans for the appliance. That's 750 gold bullion. You can't trade gold bullion until you finish the main questline. So you're going to need to wrap that up as well. And acquire the 750 bullion.
---
Other than those minor nits, yeah the ammo machine produces ammo for free.
---
You know, so do I. 
---
I just don't understand why the Berserker class appears to have been 'forsaken' altogether. Why would Bethesda bother creating it only to ignore it later?
---
if these noobs don't share they build from here i downvote
---
I will have to make a video walkthrough and post it soon. :)  Yours looks great and is hilarious at the same time.  Mine is just a standard run of the mill Haunted House.
---
Wouldn't be too bad blasting off an enemy's head while running.
---
Lots of events are worth it now. Campfire Tales and Path to Enlightenment are actually challenging.
---
Woah woah woah. You never need to spend 4K caps. 
---
People sell serums for less than 500 all the time.
---
Hmmm I’m a melee build
---
This is the best part imo. You can gain A LOT ammo for completing these.
---
Its even funnier because they had the chance but deathclaws are still pretty weak.
---
Definitely. The one today was pretty fun but i cant seem to get elder going solo.
---
The time has been already been put. 1900 hrs under my belt
---
Does one piece work, or do you need a couple?
---
Seriously tho! Maybe Angry Turtle will do some additional testing.
---
They did give us a way - simply put it in a bin log out then back into that server whilst passing brown skittles of whether it will still be there or not, or if the server will kick you , or if the player you joined on has quit , or ....... you get the picture . It is more predictable with fo1 as you join the same server as long as your under 5 minutes but you can still lose stuff if the server kick you
---
This makes me sad! I used to help lower levels at Morgantown airport too but I’m too scared to go back now LOL
---
True, been a while since I plated FO4 I just remember them having straight edges.
---
axe to the face
---
Fair enough. And no, not many nukes lately. Daily Ops is still fresh so most people are busy with that, still trading purveyor rolls, rebuilding camps with the communist bunker even more broken... doing challenges for season 2... But I'd like to do more Earls and Queens.
---
You gotta do it in under 8 minutes for the best chance
---
Please beef responsibly
---
That’s a bummer, nothing we can do to garbage trap camps now then
---
I don't understand. BOTH sides are having trouble killing creatures, and that's role playing?
---
If role playing for a builder is having trouble with mobs, wouldn't role play for combat spec be having trouble building?
---
Commando nerf incoming.
---
PS4, but than you :)
---
Energy is actually penetrating armor, which is great, but this doesn’t help melee builds. We just won’t be worth anything in the big fights.
---
I first learned about Bethesda when I picked up a copy of Oblivion.
---
The reviews were very good, mixed with a clear pattern of criticism that there are bugs galore. Bethesda games and bugs, sometimes game breaking issues, have always been associated together in my mind after that, as I saw some of the same issues repeat in Skyrim, Fallout 3, New Vegas, 4 and finally 76.
---
With this developer, bugs don't bother me. They've earned a pass. Just like how I give them a pass for their janky physics and their last gen graphics that seem always last gen, no matter when they release it. No, I follow them for their worlds. For their story telling. 
---
I'm a writer by training and profession. A good story is hard to beat. As long as they continue excelling in that area, I'll continue accepting that sometimes Bethesdas game just breaks. Sometimes it just doesn't work. 
---
But hell, you'll find some great stories during those precious moments when everything seems flawless.
---
'One Wasteland' has made every enemy, however minor, absolute 'bullet sponges'.
---
Go into atomic shop. Claim the free personal terminal. Build said terminal at your camp. Scroll through the different menus until you get a misc quest to investigate a suspicious person. Go investigate said suspicious person. Get the camera.
---
Patch 23 coming October 13? I wonder what this could be about. There's no information on it whatsoever.
---
I am. gt is w024.  honestly, I'ma need to farm for ammo. I'm out lol and my poor hammer is having some issues these days. I'd be useless all around for the moment. I figure I sneak around a few hours collecting then I can enjoy a group. Feel free to add me tho, I'll have ammo soon
---
Symptomatic was pretty good tho. Finally i can save up disease cures
---
Ah that would explain it, i got bored of doing silos months ago, i can see them being worse now having a negative impact on nukes launches.
---
For awhile there I thought we might be able to leave it as a polite disagreement.  Pity.  
---
I've been playing Fallout since 1 and Wasteland before it.  I stand by my opinion.  
---
And it's 'woe'.  Woe is me.
---
Awesome! Thank you!
---
Medium-long range. From the outside fencing/wall to the front door of West-Tek. Headshots for 650~, 1,100~ vats crit headshots.
---
Supermutants take 2 regular headshots. Every normal humanoid (raider, scorched, ghouls, etc) 1 shot headshot at level 75-100. 
---
Gutsies are a one-shot eye or torso shot for the most part. 2-3 shots on an assaultron torso.
---
Mole miners are one-shot headshot, two torso. 
---
Gotta do some more testing for other creatures.
---
Edit: I run full rifleman, tank killer and concentrated fire 3 @ 15 Perception. Run 1 Gunslinger and usually no Adrenaline, swap it in sometimes but I prefer to use 3 action boy in its place. Full sneak/covert Ops.
---
My guess is you got the level 30 one from the sheepsquatch quest
---
were you using vats all this time?
---
...are you using vats now?
---
Yup! And inside the Death claw cave in the northeast. Think its just outside the Compound where Violent Night takes place.
---
I know I get it all the time it's just I find it odd that it's not one of the rewards
---
Bethesda fucked up by stepping outside their box. FO76 should have been FO5.
---
Download the game pass app, it'll walk you through the process of getting connected.
---
Oh he had said non-monetized I was referring to that, not the microtransactions specifically
---
If your on xbox (UK time), add me, I run Ops as a full health Heavy with a Vampires Gauss cannon, get to the target, and shoot till the timers up, then run to the next, if i'm shooting i'm healing.  
---
I'l happily let you run round melting through ammo, just stay near the transmitter while your doing it.
---
I haven't had to repair my armor at all since patch and that's with running silo's, daily ops and more. That's why I was wondering what kind of build he played.
---
Yeah, you can cripple the wings, forcing a land. You can cripple the legs to prevent her from moving around as much too.
---
So with my rifleman build, my AAE lever action was on average doing 530 damage to mobs - not crit or sneak, just regular damage per shot - and now that same gun is doing 160 on average. The stats say it should do 180 (also less than before) and it’s not even doing that.
---
Same problems I don't know if just a totally missed of no damage but then again I had a shotty and I was not that far from enemies. Vats are broken
---
Definitely must have a strong wifi connection. Did your device noticeably heat up?
---
i don't think that suggesting exploit bug is a good way to handle issues.
---
Its the seneca rocks bird, I think the bird is facing a rail track of some kind. Yeah but it's not the interloper itself that gives me the creeps its also the iron faces that has been appearing through Appalachia that already has cultish and confirmed supernatural properties and even worst of all the baby interloper in "the deep". And the implications that the iron face is associated with the interloper and since the interloper is vine based and there are vines all over the mire... yeah it just hits me different. Like the mire for many reasons makes me genuinely uncomfortable.
---
I don't think the interloper needs to stay buried, I think he's well on his way out already.
---
Yeah, I did it for the first time yesterday and it was nice
---
I like pistols (and have a gunslinger) cuz of the look and feel, but mechanically/statistically I think they're just kinda worse rifles.
---
They don't really have a *thing* that makes them special, I guess?
---
As a PA build I love this. I love the run and gun play style but the game is still pretty easy and daily ops aren't super challenging to PA builds. Looking forward to being at a disadvantage for once
---
The poor wee bug fly at ark ‘‘tis didn’t stand a chance against the waves then the level 100 grafton monster got him. But I got it - so karma
---
So really, if you wanted to grind this event to its full potential you would not want to hit Elder on your first run.  Granted the % chance of getting a rare reward is low for Initiate you would want to do 3 ops and ensure that you are within the time frame for each working your way up to Elder.  Just make sure you have a team who is looking to do the same thing.
---
 My instigate/crippling/fast-reload lever on a headshot kills near every non boss mob. Same as pre patch. Only difference is I'm killing lv100 mutants now instead of lv 50. When I go for a Earl fight I swap "4" perk cards and use my furious/targeting/action fixer in commando. Rifle for ammo conserve for general play and commando for events bosses etc.  Yes the update does force me to use a min max build but I'm good with that. It only sucks when you get 3 legendaries in West Tek and they all drop heavy guns lol
---
Did you have 1st? That's probably it
---
Crashes (PS4 BSOD) during events post-patch 22. One during daily ops, one during SBQ. Disconnects as well. Overall stability of the game has definitely taken a hit since the update.
---
Yeah, sorry I got autocorrected on that. Should I go back and point out your grammar mistakes too?
---
To make caps, I'd probably just recommend picking up all the outfits you come across. Most of them weigh .1 and will sell for anywhere between 3-60 caps.
---
Resource wise, if you can find a city with a train station, you should take advantage of the fact that they've all got a crafting bench and a stash and just grab as much junk as you physically can to shovel into it. Once it starts piling up, you can start getting more selective about what you grab, but when you start you kind of just need everything. You can actually set filters for specific components too in the junk menu so it'll show a magnifying glass next to any junk that has what you need.
---
Without a build, fast melee is the way to go. The combat knife is great early on. High damage single shot weapons like the hunting rifle, or pipe revolver tend to be pretty decent choices for ammo conservation. I'd usually just open a fight with 1 or 2 rounds from a hunting rifle, and then switch to melee. If you can get the drop on a group of enemies, it's not a bad idea to chuck a nade in between them either. Ammo will be a bit difficult to come by until you reach the perk cap and can start taking some crafting perks. Until then, I'd probably honestly just buy it from players for 1 cap per round.
---
Does it not tell you on the reward screen what currency you've earned? I swear I haven't seen that.
---

Did someone say they have a face that needs an axe?
---
It doesnt even work now at all. Cant even use wallpapers on windows now. This game is ass
---
The title got my hopes up!
---
I need to know, what do you say to food builds lol
---
Overseers chest in the Flatwoods church used to be pretty popular back in the day.
---
Same with blue suitcases at Watoga and Charleston train stations.
---
Ice box outside the club house at The Whitesprings was pretty big too before they nerfed spawns and exp.
---
Are you running the daily Ops?...  That combat Glaive looks like it's worth getting, and has other mods to enhance it
---
Same happened to me yesterday.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I still can't discover abandoned bog town but they fix this immediately?
---
Launching a nuke should take you 20-30 mins max it’s not that hard you spend that much time on a event or 2 in the game anyway
---
Someone there is probably using follow through or taking one for the team giving you a damage boost
---
I thought I had read somewhere on here that SBQ no longer drops repair kits.
---
I think it's more that they make group, do their daily ops, and then just stay in that group not realizing that they might be causing problems for people trying to find groups.
---
Create your own group. Problem mostly solved as usually fresh joiners will be wanting to do the ops.
---
Putting some perk points into your weapon class isn't overly technical.  The wasteland is supposed to be a dangerous place.  One Wasteland is a significant change and they are listening to player feedback.  They will make adjustments.  Submit a feedback ticket.
---
Leader of the pack is great since you get 3-4 legendary items that scale to your level
---
I just reset my game after dropping a water on the ground from my Alt, It was still there for my Main character when I Logged back in and switched. 
---
The biggest thing is to make sure you pick the items up within half and hour (I'm fairly certain the despawn is 30 minutes).
---
I’ve come to the conclusion people are just stupid
---
Ah, it definitely has a damage drop without it on. If I swap to commando and forget to swap back I’m putting way less damage out
---
So, I get the severe part a bit (even though it had minimal affect on me), but "all at once part", did you mean "don't balance everything at once" or "don't change everything at once"?
---
With two of my characters, i recently installed my camp on the same location, on the Acid deposite next the "Hopewell Cave".
---
On my main character, i basically went for a near full budget camp and i realised that everytime i was fast-traveling at my camp or someone was fast-traveling at my camp, it would trigger a random encounter, on the road between these two locations. Enemies were always high lvl ( yeah it was before the recent patch, last week ) and they were eventualy attacking my camp if i wasn't taking care of this situation.
---
On the other hand on my low lvl character ( who is now lvl 91 and still is on this location. ) the worst i get there is 3 or 4 mongrels. I didn't even get attacked once since the patch.
---
...my camp, on this alt, is a simple 2x2 fondations build with an upper floor and 6 turrets. I didn't even trigger a random encounter once !
---
Here what i'm trying to say is that i feel like the size of your camp may affect the type of camp raid you may face. I still have to test it a lil more...but it's not like i only had this to do with my life lol. But i just wanted to share this with you and i was also hopping that someone could may be tell me if it can actually be possible.
---
I've actually stopped playing recently, sucks to hear about it being fucked again
---
I'm hoping that's what they are doing with Expeditions, which it sounds like. I dream of something like Far Cry New Dawn had, where they had a bunch of unique locations to go to with a simple mission to do
---
I got elder.... Double of the same rare plan (as in, two plans for ONE run). So.... It's either very much hit or very much miss....
---
Uncharged gauss shots seem to be displaying a higher damage than they actually do.
---
Either that, or charged gauss shots show a lower number of damage than reality.
---
I noticed the same things you are reporting.
---
It's not stupid!  It's ADVANCED
---
Okay couple comments coming from a game developer. There graphics are new gen, they want to mass sell this game so, they have to not a lot but very little, dwindle them down. Imagine running this game on high quality on a top tier PC and a low tier xbox one original. The graphics are going to be 2 different ends of the spectrum. But thank you! I really appreciate, that's awesome your a story writer.
---
Officially just jumped around outside the playable area for an hour to find that the marker leads me into the end of the map.
---
It’s doable, I run a non optimized stealth sniper build which is completely combat ineffective in ops. I skipped the first day as the enemies needed to be killed by melee, but yesterday the enemies only exploded when they die so I figured I’d give it a whirl. It was chaos, I was just running and gunning for 20 mins straight. The game felt more like CoD instead of fallout and not in a bad way. But I managed to fight through it all and complete the op. I think that if you’ve got a crew that you play with regularly and are able to organize your tactics and builds to compliment one another these ops would be a walk in the park and would be a lot of fun. As a casual and solo player these ops could be overwhelming for some people but still doable depending on your experience and play style, if your able to quickly adapt your build and play style you should be fine. if you are unable to adapt, that where you’ll run into problems. Finding out that my usual tactic of maintaining stealth and clearing a room and moving forward won’t work was a bit alarming at first but once I realized that I’ve got to keep moving and fighting and I couldn’t just find a choke point and kill everything in a narrow hallway things got better. There is no harm in giving it a try though, you’ll never know unless you give it an honest effort.
---
The melee kill is random as is the faction, i'm really looking forward to Blood Eagles with resilient lol
---
You can still have a build with quality of life perks and then swap it out for dps related perks, but you do need to level past 50 and invest in those cards. It isn't even a matter of getting good, just a matter of special points allotment and optimizing it over time as you level past 50. Leveling up to 50 tends to be a mishmash of QoL and DPS, and how familiar a player is to the game economy and just rpg style games in gen. Things that might seem counterintuitive, like picking up everything and either scrapping or selling it, at the tradeoff of needing to walk overencumbered to an npc vendor, generally can yield resources of all types. Going around exclusively hunting for one resource is not bad either cuz then you learn for future reference where to locate such resources. So on the one hand, even from a casual playstyle, if you know how to manipulate the game in your favor, you can overlook the difficulty. You can find which quests are easier, which zones are easier, which mobs are easier, have caps and resources and ammo, use tinkerbench, sell anything on vendors that someone who is cap rich can recognize is a low lvl person and help out by buying your all your cheap shit, lol. Using mics. Joining groups. Lots of other MMOs have linear content that is more intuitively easy to follow. Some games like Bloodborne or intentionally brutal games, are actually not that hard if you just do the damn grind and a little independent research outside the game. The problem is ppl want to think casual means lone wanderer, not using any of the features of what makes an mmo an mmo. At lower lvls I remember coming across other lower lvls who were just asocial and trying to do their own thing, aside from the basic platitudes of using emotes which can be easily ignorned and disregarded. So I think the difficulty would make more sense if you can communicate with other lower lvls better, and not always expect a higher lvl to come out and drop goodies.
---
Got it do you have to own gamepass
---
Nope
---
I'm finally giving FO76 a proper try, so I'm sorry for any dumb questions. Definitely looking for a PA build, but not sure if I want melee or Heavy.  
---
Does this build not use any mutations? If not, is there some other benefit for Strange In Numbers? I assume they simply weren't added onto here.
---
I like your answer :)
---
Once you’ve launched a nuke once the game should unlock nuclear briefcases we can buy to sink caps, though this is probably impossible as loads of people opening one at same time would fry the servers
---
quest markers have always been wonky inside the valley galleria, of course they wouldn't bother to fix it for the new content 🤷
---
But they added better lighting in the morgantown trainyard, so there's that
---
Everything was nerfed but these changes made AA hit harder than Junkies if my build doesn't use the tank killer perk. So essentially my Junkies commando  suffers the negative of addictions for lower damage than AA on a build without Tank Killer. With Tank killer eqquipped it does a little more damage than AA but not enough more to justify addictions. I tested with non explosive weapons so results my be different with the explosive effect or a different build. Personally I'll probally switch to quad so I don't wear out my controllers reload button prematurely 😁
---
Great? Your dps is still ass against bosses. Melee sucks now. Commando and heavy gunner do everything better. Completely broken is what we had with unarmed before the nerf.
---
Fire department is always empty. My luck
---
Nah it pops up super fast right after killing the boss. Kind of inconvenient.
---
Once again just shows the lack of ability to chat and talk with others so the more experienced players can fill in the team. I have been on great teams and shitty teams so far. Just the way it is in this game...
---
Yeah, crit builds tend to be somewhat workable. I play manual aiming pistol-sniping for the most part, made endlessly easier with Gauss pistols having silencers. How does it handle on the SBQ and Earl? I'm curious to hear.
---
yeah if you were on team some had "taking one for the team" acitive.  Its kind of crazy having a 40 percent damage increase like that.   Follow through is sneak related though.
---
Oh my explosive lever rifle is terrible now. 4-5 shots needed and it only had 5 shots so I have to constantly reload. Reload with multiple mobs = death
---
Your right of course. Despite the downvotes. 
---
Especially if their are going to be no updates to daily ops for a while. It will be another dead event this game has by the time it gets an update.
---
I dont think 3 areas and one mode (being uplink) will be enough to last long. Especially considering how dead almost everything else in this game becomes.
---
Any way you have a picture of where the repeater is?...
---
Where do the coins come from?
---
I'm currently balancing whether to answer this...
---
It's an exploit but like all the others it will get fixed. There is nothing wrong with PvP in fallout. If you don't like it then, don't do it.
---
I went into Public and found a two new players yesterday after I tested out what it's like for a lvl 10 character.  I felt bad for them after experiencing just 1/2 an hour of what it's like to play from their POV, dropped about 100 stimpaks, 100 radaways, lots of food, and dumped about 10k of .38 and .44 rounds on them. (Sad part is - they've probably already went through all of it.)
---
This made me laugh.
---
That is not the case at all. There is a limited window in which you will rejoin the same private server (+/- 5 mins) but it is not the same all the time and you *do* risk losing your stuff.
---
But it is, so why shit on melee so much? Also, that was a huge reason I paid for 1st so I could run them solo.
---
This is exactly it.  There should be scary enemies you think twice about fighting, and enemies you have to work at killing, and then normal enemies that can be a real threat in numbers, and then finally trash enemies.  
---
Things like non legendary radroaches, radrats, molerats, mongrels and wolves, cave crickets, and most scorched and ghouls should be trash mobs for the most part.  A horde can be trouble and of course sometimes stronger versions that aren't an easy kill.  But mostly these kinds of enemies shouldn't be so tanky.  Well, radroaches are still pretty worthless  but molerats and wolves are far more trouble than necessary with the way they move around and go underground in the case of the molerats.  When they are constantly jumping through you and directly under your feet, the hit detection seems off, and the amount of rounds required to put one down is pretty unnecessary.  Sometimes it would be cool to have a more powerful one here and there, but that could be relegated to the legendary versions.  Though I would say that it should be very rare to see higher than a one star legendary of the normal kinds of these enemies.
---
But deathclaws, assaulttrons, yao guai, dudes in power armor, these kinds of enemies should be ones you have to think twice about tackling if you are not built for damage or have numbers.  A solo sniper should steer clear unless they can keep hidden and have a high powered weapon.  And going against multiple of these kinds of enemies should be a death sentence unless you are armored up with a ton of stims and high damage output.
---
If I'm level 75 and I find a 75 deathclaw alpha, or a legendary deathclaw, I better be ready to get my ass handed to me or call for backup if I'm not willing to drop a ton of resources into the battle and use mines and grenades and make sure to cripple limbs and such to give me an advantage.  And if I miss my rolls on the cripples, then I better be ready to become a bloody smear.  But if I'm 75, and come across a 30 deathclaw, of course it should be easy unless I'm running around naked with a combat knife.
---
The thing is there should be scary enemies you tend to avoid like crazy unless you really have the numbers and firepower and the upper hand to handle.  And there should be the kinds of enemies where if I have a mini gun or something, I can feel like a real bad ass mowing them down left and right, and maybe only get overwhelmed if there is a real swarm of them.
---
Of course, there should be differences in power between the intelligence and utility character in robes using a laser pistol and the power armor walking tank using a gatling plasma.  I certainly don't want the game to be easy and I have no problem running from something when I know it will end me.  But the bullet sponge nature of how things are currently does suck.  When the challenge is, will I run out of ammo first or will my guns/armor break first and not can I kill this thing before it kills me, then it's not really very fun to be honest.
---
I've been playing Fallout since Fallout 1 and I love Fallout and the Fallout universe.  I like where Bethesda has taken Fallout, even if I really did like how it was way back in the FO1 and 2 days.  But fallout has always had easy and challenging enemies.  Usually, the easy enemies were only a problem when you were super low levels, but some enemies were always a challenge and you didn't even attempt to tackle some of them if you happened to be a smooth talker or intelligence based character without preparing to reload your save or taking in a full team of kitted out dudes all drugged out.
---
That's where I would like to see FO76 at and where the pendulum has swung too far the other way.  I certainly agree that there wasn't a whole lot of challenge before and enemies across the board were too weak.  I was only scared of fighting a legendary scorchbeast the first time I fought one at level 30 or so when it was level 50.  And it was a bit of a challenge, but honestly it was a pushover.  Really it just took a long time and was annoying to fight.  It didn't do enough damage or cripple limbs, it just flew around while I took pot shots and then took an inordinate amount of damage to kill while not really being much of a threat.  But instead of taking so much damage and wasting so much time flying around and dragging out the fight, it should be the kind of fight you need backup to handle, or a bunch of buffs and power armor and a good gun to have a chance.
---
I know there isn't a quick and easy way to fix things and make it where non optimal characters can still play and have fun, and have to run from some big bad enemies, while still having challenging fights for the min maxed power players.  But it can be done.  The way it is now is not a good way to do it.  And I hope that with further tweaking, Bethesda will take things in the right direction.  I think instead of having everything everywhere be leveled, maybe only certain "dangerous" areas in each area could be leveled so that way there could be challenging stuff everywhere.  And of course deathclaws and scorchbeasts and the like should always be dangerous for their level range and players who have not built to give and take the damage should not attempt them alone until they are a lot higher level than what they are attacking.  But if you have a level 700, optimized for damage character with crazy tooled out guns and armor, really there shouldn't be many enemies that give you a challenge at all other than bosses and legendaries and similar leveled big bad enemies.
---
Why write on reddit then if you're not expecting to answer?
---
Oblivion had its fair share of bugs too. Still one of the best games I've ever played.
---
That's one of those titles I'd fully support a redux for.
---
Sorry bruv.
---
This is the exact problem. To give rifleman any chance of being competitive on all the bullet sponge style enemies, they'd have to be buffed by like 500 percent or more which is ludicrous. Bringing a lever action to a fight with Earl is completely pointless with how dps rules the endgame.
---
I play rifleman or gunslinger early game, which are still totally viable after the update btw. But at a certain level that instigating explosive lever or .44 just will not help you with tankier enemies. Commando and heavy guns are really the only endgame builds precisely because of this and that's no fun.
---
Ah. I’m not a sneaky build but yeah taking one for the team is great.
---
Come at me bro!
---
The new meta is Nocturnal pistol builds, obviously.
---
You did exactly what you needed to do.
---
Your the reason Bethesda is going down hill. You can't get over the fact that the game didn't correlate with fallout 4. You dont even pay attention to the lore or the time line in the games. Have you put into thought? That maybe just maybe fallout 76 is just suppose to fill in the gaps for what's missing so when, "FO5" comes out it will be a giant banger of a game! I'm sorry to break it to you but fallout 4 isn't even the 4th game in the series its like the 6th or 7th.
---
I haven't done it myself today, yet. I'll let you know in a bit when I do my first run, I'll grab a screenshot if I'm able to find it
---
are you agreeing with me or telling me I am wrong? lol
---
I’ve found that exterminators work better than nocturnal.
---
I had 2 newbys (level 21 and 23) with me today..... they said they were doing fine,and one of them runs a pure comfort eating build with cannibal, lead belly and so on.... so ther eis that. Also they were able to survive the daily ops and strahlenschlägerei.. whatever that is in english, the one with the contaminated ore and hordes of glowing gouhls where you have to protect 3 or 4 blue guys while you mine the ore for them and they do fucking nothing.
---
Yep, ran into people doing this, even after a couple of group-hops.
---
I guess it's the new "Event group but nobody is doing events"
---
then you should know you've been using a bugged shotgun all this time.
---
it's not a bad thing, but when they eventually fix it, if ever, it's gonna suck.
---
shotguns in general are pretty eh.
---
You are right, did the same test with a instigating hunting rifle, single headshot to kill, 800 damage.
---
They confirmed it during QuakeCon, said they will be a mix of 'fan service' (Pitt? DC?) as well as new locations.
---
Only downside is that seems to be it as far as new maps go, so no Far Harbour style expansions in the pipeline.
---
i got rare from initiate at day 1 when i was just checking shit out and dying repeatedly cause i didnt bring any melee
---
The only thing to stop them was the poor companions who took all the stings and passed out periodically lol
---
I'm probably just going to get it. Since I need a matching set to trigger funky Duds and sizzling style, I will probably just hotkey it for funsies until I get the full set. Guess I'm grinding grinding grinding away for a bit.
---
I have a group I play with from time to time but mostly I play solo so I guess I'm gona have to switch up my style a little. I've already lost a load of damage with the nerf but without being hidden half my stuff is useless. I guess it's going to be trial and error as I don't really want to switch my perks at this point.
---
I've got a low level alt which I may just go crazy on but then again I do less damage to begin with
---
Guess it'll be more fun than one shorting everything without taking any damage
---
Oh ok cool
---
I was pretty sure it also awards you sizable chunks of ammo at the end....
---
I would love a remake of all the elderscrolls after elderscrolls 6 comes out
---
Tesla is classified as a rifle.
---
automatic = commando  
---
standard = rifleman
---
you can see the damage numbers change on the weapon when you equip/unequip the cards.
---
Thought they removed that. Mebe with the slope merge trick tho. 
---
Dont have one or my own yet, can you hang a light inside?
---
Yeah I got a double drop- friggin TWO of the ("Caged Lights"). Might have the wrong name but I ate one and stashed the other.
---
I want the medical bay sympto thing so bad for my field hospital.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=meta&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on
---
Do you have evidence for this? Because I have hundreds to thousands of hours in fallout 4 and Skyrim playing as a stealth ranged build.
---
This subreddit never changes. Whenever there's a legitimate complaint at the game these bootlickers make posts like this where they try to paint the complaint as unreasonable. Look at his language, people who are criticising are, "screaming really loud," yet thankfully he's here to provide a "more level headed" response. It's laughable.
---
Because some are offering to help me on my build and I would appreciate that if I needed it but, I will clarify some more if I can. My characters are 300+, they have 40+ pieces of the best 3 star unyielding armor pieces between them with sentinel and cavalier, they also have 30+ 3 star bloodied weapons and bloodied explosive between them. It isn't that I can't make waste to everything that stands before me, I even demolished the assaultron boss with all the minions on the very first daily ops without using power armor, solo, within a minute. It is that once in a while it is nice to be able to spam low level enemies for fun and to be able to grind more than I am using for repairs. I DO expect to one shot a mole rat or feral ghoul if it is in the forest area!! Games are made to be fun not a grinding nightmare. The weapons and armor are breaking far more than they used to. Now it is just a 24/7 grind for materials to keep up repairs and ammo with no end in sight, at least this is how I see it. There is nothing wrong with my build. Thank you for the offers to fix it if there was. I just don't want to play a game where I am grinding 90% to fight with broken weapons and armor the other 10%. That is why I am walking away until a better balance is made to make it more gaming than grinding. Good luck to the rest of you
---
Oh, definitely mutations, let me add which ones I would use
---
I love it being more challenging, but I wish they left the Forest as a low level area. Sometimes I liked to go to the Forest and look for loot and just relax, but it seems like now I always need to be on my toes. I went to Flatwoods yesterday and got attacked by lvl 50 Mr Farmhands, which was funny but kind of annoying. Otherwise I'm loving the game and the new challenge they brought
---
The past 3 days on this sub alone has proven that 100 times over.
---
Easy enough to regain those.  
---
*Looks at a glowing ghoul* 
---
*You are suffering from rad worms.*
---
if you're high level, like 300+, you can make a hybrid build that excels in most scenarios.
---
Thanks, I've lucked out and gotten two rare rewards already, the massive generator and the Gutter plan.  It's interesting that I can craft a 1 star weapon now, but doesn't seem to give possibility to get 2 or 3 stars on it.
---
I run a strength focused melee build and I see your point, I really want them to add a slider that allows us to adjust the games difficulty to our liking. That way people who want to play the game with a challenge can and the people who want to play it casually can.
---
If you don't want to play in a group, why are you playing what's basically an MMO?
---
If you aren't knowledgeable about the game, why don't you spend 10 minutes on Google and learn about it?
---
Lack of effort doesn't entitle you to anything.  Multiple people have proven the game is still playable on a casual level.  The people complaining refuse to change their play style even a little, even if it might make the game more enjoyable for them.
---
And the thing is....if they suck now, they probably sucked before.  It just wasn't as noticeable.
---
Thanks mate!
---
It's isnt that big of a deal. My 2 mains with their not even close to optimized builds now need to shoot things 3-5 more times.
---
My new Toon started the night the patch dropped has fared just fine. Died a few times. Ran from a few fights. Nothing punishing, but definitely had to be more careful.
---
Welcome to RNGs.
---
I'm still running a bloodied stealth commando and having no problems at all.
---
Well, no problems other than in Daily Ops that is.
---
Have you seen the UI over-haul mod that Skyrim got on PC? After using that it's impossible for me not to hate Bethesda's default UI. I am sick of those damned sliders. I just want to be able to type in the numbers, at a minimum.
---
never stopped
---
I like it, but I miss the corny 50's sci-fi vibe.
---

---
Tried to load up this morning to be told I had a 6hour download. That was my morning fucked.
---
So, I've just got in from work and it should be finished
---
WTF is it for ?
---
Repair kits are a thing
---
There almost certainly with be a real expansion. People are already pretty bored of Appalachia, they'll need to start expanding eventually if they want a steady stream if players.
---
At least he didn't call anyone names
---
Yeah doesn't make sense if you're gonna nerf across the board but make it so two separate weapon builds can still solo them. Sucks the main reason you got first is gone. That Scrap Box is still super useful tho.
---
I have not seen these iron faces.  Well now you’ve upgraded my chills to the nervous nellies.  Thanks.  :P
---
Full set of enemy appropriate armor and Stimpaks.
---
I appreciate it but only had a couple hours to play before work so guess I'm just gonna try to knock out the scoreboard challenges..
---
This exactly! I had loads of fun before but now it’s really not! It’s all a grind!
---
Sounds like it
---
You can bump up cap generation a LITTLE, by swapping perks (If you get lucky and draw the better prices one from a pack), and by taking food/chem. Grape(berry?) mentats are a solid bump/discount when shopping, but if you go that route, wait until you have a lot of stuff to sell at once.
---
Any time you see a Red Rocket stop, or a Train Station, loot ALL the junk in the area, break it down, and stash it. In generally, any time you see a crafting bench, break down any junk you have on you as well, it makes it weigh less. Once the stash is full, bulk everything (or bulk as you go to save space) and sell anything beyond a reasonable store up.
---
That said, you shouldn't need a lot of caps early on. If you're buying things from NPC vendors, you can likely get them WAY cheaper from players. Join a public team, travel to any team members bases, buy ammo (Almost always 1cap per round, versus 3+ from NPCs) buy plans (Often 10-50 caps, versus 500+ from vendors) if you need them right then. But most plans you can get as random rewards, so do events and such when you can.
---
Also, keep an eye out for any 3 star items for sale. I often stock really BAD 3 star items for 100-200 caps. If you buy it, take it to the Rusty Pick, you can cash it in for Legendary Scrip, and then buy a 3 star armor/weapon from the vendor, that will be at your level. Its fairly easy for someone playing 'efficiently' to cap out on how many items they can trade in, so unless it's really good, lots of players look at legendary items and have to decide if its worth the weight cost to hang onto it until they can trade it in. Some people log in, immediately hit the cap, and still have items waiting to trade in for the NEXT day.
---
Never found any serums despite looking :(. Maybe being on xbox has something to do with it idk. Just got unstable isotope mutation now too.. any more and I might just radaway anyways.
---
Sounds rough. It's almost enough to believe the sentiment some people on here have expressed: the patch essentially ensures people spend much more time in the game farming materials and ammo. Looks very much like a vicious cycle of use up all ammo &gt; grind for materials for ammo &gt; use up all ammo &gt; ...
---
Hope it gets better for everyone, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
Looks like you may be spending more time gathering supplies/eating/and being burdened with little sustainability with a min/max build of rifle/sneak damage.
---
Hard to sneak in PA and Sniper has a slow return on shots, until you reach critical. 
---
If you are focusing in Perception. Commando and AP's will help more than sneak/crit.
---
Then again, I have only played for little less than 3 months so my suggestions are still newbie.
---
Vanguard Vamp 160 I roll in dirt and then spit on your couch.
---
If that's changed and I can now be near other players who are higher then me and I don't get destroyed anymore then I might play again, did the game get more optimisation for console?
---
Why do you expect to sell ammo when everyone just farms ops for ammo?
---
Legit all good suggestions, and I suspect similar stuff is their future hope, I'm just saying with the stripped down, brute force method of instances they're launching with (the infancy aspect), I think they're all about making sure shit "works" (for once) and doing it in the dumbest, simplest way possible... and it seems tha process just completely fucks stealth folks. It's a bummer, but I really dont think it is permanent.
---
Then again, it is Bethesda, sooooo...  I'm equally prepared to eat crow, lol.
---
Can't stealth currently, I think the Uplink Op has anti-stealth built in, but maybe future ops won't, or even future new ops may require you to use stealth to reach objectives or end up facing hordes of enemies if you try to force your way through.  
---
I don't think so, but it is a nice thought
---
Except that my low level alts get legendary perks because my main is over 50. So they COULD benefit from it early.
---
Anyone else seriously getting ESO deja vu when their 'One Tamriel' update launched?
---
Ah right. I wish that would be on the reward screen too as I can't say i ever noticed it pop up. Though it took until today to notice how much xp I got for completing the event.
---
I thought you were being serious for a second.  Good sarcastic post man.
---
So gods damned pedantic. How bout fix more bugs and glitches?
---
I did (with a team), 3 times.
---
Wait they nerved boulstered? the +3 when you are low health?
---
Fight you?? Why would I fight you? Maybe some in game romance over a Rib eye Steak and Tato Salad?
---
salami to the face
---
I'm just trying not too die to hard to know what the heck is going on.
---
I’d like for them to use caps or a mix of caps and gold. Gives more value
---
Imo power armor heavy weapons
---
Yikes, don’t ever go afk during that event.
---
I haven’t unlocked any jetpacks yet, so expensive. So it just appears as a mod option without having to buy the plan to unlock the normal version? I guess it’s permanently the atomic shop cosmetic style? Or can you change what it looks like? Does it still cost flux etc?
---
Two shot grenade launcher has been awesome in the ops. Never use it because ammo, but now... damn.
---
Two shogun blasts to the legs gimp both those. Assaultron seems to require an extra face blast to make sure the laser can't get ya. After that it's almost comical to wipe up.
---
They've always been the thing that I pick up the most.
---
My gf is still running bloodied sniper and I'm still running magic minigun PA, so nothing changed really? Other than us getting more exp for the kills that is
---
Yeah, one or the other would be nice, but both hit a lot of people hard. Yes, magic weapons, etc, are going to become the new meta in a sense so that people aren't completely fucked in terms of damage output.
---
Oh no I totally agree, just seems well... More now like way more
---
Its great. Andi have no idea how people are getting killed by things like mole rats. You have to be the most garbage build to have something like a mole rat kill you. I still kill them and all the other pests with ease. People just wanna complain cause they can't play on autopilot 24/7 now and have to pay more attention
---
Eh. There are 2 bosses in the game. Neither are fun, and neither are even time effective legendary farms. I clean up in Daily Ops, clean up at events, clean up when exploring. Seems like my build covers 99% of the game just fine.
---
I believe people were using some exploit to get the DR to double.
---
Edit: I fucked up, changed to vanguard.
---
Edit2: Fuck me, it is bolstering.
---
3x Bolstering, 2x Unyeilding Blooded Gauss Shotgun for me :) works a treat
---
For me it's just easier to equip a set of power armor and whack at stuff with my Cursed Pickaxe. I'm never in danger and it's boring, but the one time I tried to run and gun in my stealth gear/weapons I died way too many times.
---
Just switch to a vampires weapon. It’s makes daily ops a breeze
---
I find it quite enjoyable actually
---
Your original post had some great concerns for casual players. However, this comment just makes you look bad.
---
You think you're cool because you swipe your credit card for items? Because you pay for fallout first to get advantages? You think being a whale and simply buying your way through the game makes you better than other players who actually *play* the game and engage with mechanics to complete content?
---
Players like you are the reason we have toxic microtransactions in games to begin with. You are the problem. You are a whale, and your pay to win attitude is destroying the online gaming industry. Think about that, and maybe try playing the game instead if whipping out your wallet.
---
I thought it was lvl 40 but I dunno
---
It now reminds me of being level 16 back at launch. Having bad gear, no ammo, and trying to clear that prison with my brother. It was quite the challenge.
---
OMG YES! Finally! I've been wanting this since launch!!! Hopefully soon....
---
Mr char lore is non existent. Dresses up weird. Was Original Fashnact mask and clown gear followed by dressing gown and captains hat, currently pink Cosmo space suit.
---
This is so heart wrenching, I’m sorry you had to go through this.
---
400 + 400 = 1600
---
Nice try, Bethesda.
---
At least you get to run it, even with LFG on xbox I find it hard. Done it once and got the thing you go in to get cured but would love to just run it and help people who not tried yet.
---
The new meta is ammo, LOTS of ammo. Spray and pray is the new meta and it works beautifully. No enemy can survive a mediocre gun with a ton of ammo.
---
Are Power Armor displays a thing? I don’t think I’ve seen it in any unlockables. Don’t know why there doesn’t seem to be a visible display of power and etc. I had to look around to see which of my water purifiers weren’t running on power.
---
Still doing fine with bloodied 2-hand melee. Maybe not as strong, but with the legendary strength and legendary 'take one for the team' anything I can't 1HKO I can 2HKO.
---
Why would you say that? My gf is still doing great with a bloodied ... combat rifle I think? That we modded to be a sniper.
---
Jeez... i’m having a hard time not calling it a nerf...
---
3 independent rolls so it really doesn’t matter if you trigger them in 1 or 3 runs.
---
It feels okay for my lvl.105 character who is just starting to get DECENT gear. It’s not too bad, I just feel like I use up so much ammo now.
---
I feel for the lower level players though. I think they have a much more valid complaint of the balancing than higher levels who have more gear and build selection available.
---
The nerf on melee is the only problem. You have to be able to pack a punch with melee
---
&gt; If you are having trouble I will remind you that this is a multiplayer  game. Make a team, grab a mic, and go take on the wasteland together. If  you are a lone wanderer. Well you might just have to make some  adjustments. 
---
I will remind you that the game was advertised as being able to play solo. If the enemies are too hard to handle solo then they need to nerf the enemies period. The main allure of this game for many of the old fallout fans is that you could still play solo. So fuck your "get a team losers \*snort\*" idea.
---
Sure
---
3x 1\* always.
---
I'm not on any team, never have been.
---
Aaaah yeah the one where they got shot with bloody mess and a plasma weapon to get revived and then server hop to get 99 to all stats? xD
---
Creating your own public group has the added benefit of not getting kicked off the team in the middle of the op. I joined several ops teams last night and no one was doing the daily ops. Finally ended up on a server with no active team for it. Created my own and had 2 people join within seconds so I fired up the event and we ran it nice and easy elder first run.
---
Let's not forget that One Wasteland abbreviates to "OW". Very appropriate :P
---
Campfire tales was rough before the changes on console if you had the waves of bugs at the end. Not because of the spawns but because I was the only one adding wood to keep the fire lit.
---
Let's not.
---
I miss sneaking to the Harper's vendor and getting the random level 68 ghoul snacking me around while selling.
---
Dude, no one is saying a molerat is like a deathclaw.  Hardly anyone is dying to molerats unless it's a massive horde of them whereas a deathclaw is most certainly trouble compared to said molerat.
---
BUT, a molerat shouldn't take multiple shotgun blasts from point blank range to kill.  Or multiple rifle bullets put in it's brain.  A horde of molerats shouldn't really be deadly, but annoying as you catch a disease and have your health chipped away.  But it's not fun trying to blast a bunch of molerats that keep going directly under your feet and burrowing so fast that they are a chore to hit before even taking more than one high powered round.
---
That's where the frustration comes in.  Deathclaws should be an "oh fuck" moment when is sees you.  But every time some of the smaller, very erratic movement enemies show up, you shouldn't have to think "oh fuck, not these shits again" because they are so dang annoying and take so many rounds to kill.  If a horde of molerats was maybe deadly as they gnaw away at your ankles, that would at least be better than having to fire so many rounds and missing so much on enemies that should be trash and easy to handle unless you are already at deaths door and are fighting with a rolling pin.
---
Part of the frustration with some of the smaller enemies, and some bigger enemies like mirelurks, is that they either move directly on top of you where you keep having to do a 180 to even see them to shoot, or they have such erratic movements it's difficult to track them and put in a round or two.  And then when it takes so many shots to kill them on top of the misses, it's just frustrations.
---
And to be honest, I don't personally have that much trouble.  My gatling gun makes short work of most of those types of enemies, but I remember trying to use some of the lower powered guns like the 10mm, or the automatic pipe rifle, and even before one wasteland some enemies took too much to kill when they really shouldn't.  I couldn't imagine trying to use a weak gun like that now with how many rounds you would need to use.  Yeah, having a legendary gun with a bunch of mods would make it better, but what about before you get there?  What do you do when you don't have options and you use what you have?
---
Challenge doesn't have to be added by making fights last longer and take way more ammo and condition from your weapon and armor.  There are lots of better ways they could have done it, though maybe it's just too early and they will get around to making it better.  I just hope it doesn't make a bunch of fresh blood give up on the game before they get there.  Or make some people who have been playing a long time and having fun quit because now playing the game can really be a chore if you aren't built for straight damage.  Having to ask "What's your build" when someone is frustrated so they can be given pointers on why their weapon and perks are crap and what to do to not get rolled, well it shouldn't have to be like that.  that's really the biggest drawback to One Wasteland right now.  Is the unoptimized builds don't really have any place to go to farm scrap or exp without getting slapped around when they did before.
---
I had something like this happen today. I started an Ops team, it filled up, I jumped into an Op and nobody followed. Waited a few minutes, very nicely asked if people were coming. Nobody came or said anything. Kicked people, they rejoined and still didn’t show up. 
---
Seriously people, if you don’t want to do a Daily Op that’s fine, but leave those team spots open for people who do. If you run an Op and decide you’re done for the day, leave the team. It’s the closest thing to matchmaking we have for these, let’s apply a little etiquette.
---
This subreddit has been full of people who are absolutely unwilling to admit anything is wrong with this game. 2 years of game breaking bugs, unnecessary nerfs, exploits, hacks, and Bethesda shafting their fanbase and these people will still bend over backwards to defend everything BGS does.
---
Not to sound like a shitter, but.
---
After playing it for a day and re-working some things after having my character completely shafted, I'm not finding things overly hard anymore.
---
I'm finding them to be tedious and a chore.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Bullet sponges and artificial difficulty is not fun. 
---
Being practically forced into specific builds and weapons you really don't want to use is not fun. Meta = No fun allow.
---
This is a fallout title with multiplayer, and it should of stayed that way. Playing in a group should be a feature, not a near requirement. 
---
This whole thing could of  been handled a lot better.
---
getting from point a to b is a bitch. You take one wrong turn and your dead
---
Yes, it happened to me yesterday.
---
I've personally never experienced a failure with the method, done it well over 100 times. 
---
But it's good to know that either way.
---
Spent 30min earlier today killing supermutants around the booster and this thing wouldn't go up...  
---
Pros : Went from 400 shotgun shells to 1K+++  
---
Cons : Adios stimpack stock  
---
Sadly didn't have my ultracite armor on me...
---
Why in the hell do they keep bumping perk loadouts so far off. We've been asking for this since day one of this game. Is it ok to use the mod for it or not with the new terms? What the hell Bethesda. So pissed.
---
it's a terrible assault\* rifle variant.
---
My stealth rifleman still does fine, but that seems to be literally just me.
---
Indeed. And even one additional player with you will make the run so much smoother and easier, if you both stay within the radius of the signal thingy.
---
I thought that was Unyielding. Bolstering increases DR the lower your health.
---
This ain't Call of Duty lmao
---
It's an assault rifle with prefixed legendary effects Nocturnal 33%vats and I forgot the 3rd effect but it's pretty much useless imo
---
Dealing with the floors aren't as easy as it looks, took me a long while to deal with them.
---
shiiiiiiiiiiiet ok I like dat.
---
I honestly think they should have done one or the other. Preferably add one wasteland without nerfing weapons. I'm level 300 and 210. Both my characters are optimized for combat but now it sucks. I used to love roaming around the forest with my junkies pipe pistol. Now that pistol is useless everywhere for me. It's small stuff like that I hate.
---

---
All 4 limbs. Since I've done it I've not been crippled, so I've also gained 3 points to play with aswell.
---
Easier said then done, but get a two shot launcher if you ever have the chance. It’s the best prefix for them since it doubles their damage. Plus you get 2 AoE explosions from each projectile. It’s considerably better than any other combo for launchers.
---
But in general I like this idea and would love to see it happen.
---
I shot a Yao Guai for 15 minutes once.
---
True story
---
The thing is I found this out by accident.  I picked up the osmosis kit on another quest as loot and never new what it was for.  had it for a long time and then one day looked it up.  Im typically no one to use exploits to cheat the system.  Just figured it was one of those rare items.  The article I read didn't mention it was a cheat or exploit per say.
---
I don't think so, at least not the camo one. you get the option but a message saying that you don't have the required components pops up, if you don't know the plan.
---
have they fixed the camo one yet? crafted myself half a dozen arms just to be sure.
---
(pssst.. assault rifle, shhh)
---
That's the problem though. In this game, players are now forced into making a synergized combat-focused perk set to play the game.
---
To contrast that, in previous Fallout games you didn't have to do this, and could experience the entire game by speech checks and alternative solutions.
---
Some people just want a fun story to be immersed in.
---
Others just want to relax and build Camps. 
---
Some want to min-max the game mechanics.
---
All of these are valid goals, but now only combat is "viable".
---
Bethesda big challenge here is trying to merge all into one satisfying experience for everyone.
---
Ranged build.  The robots with melee kills only was my literal nightmare.  Unkillable Gutsies everywhere.
---
So the server kick can cause it? 
---
I just quit the game and then switched characters after logging back in, and it was still there.
---
Totes agree. I’m hanging around level 110? I was considering starting a new character. 
---
It’s actually not any different for me, in my experience. If anything, my Tesla rifle is more fun. I think one wasteland has allowed me to have almost infinite ammo.
---
Seriously, if you stack your damage perks correctly and specialize your character, you’re gonna have a better time.
---
I think most people may find trouble if their character is not invested in Strength or Endurance perks. I would focus on those stats and perks as a new player before anything else. Luck and Charisma perks seem more end game to me.
---
&gt; If you don't want to play in a group, why are you playing what's basically an MMO? 
---
Because at the E3 presentation Todd Howard specifically stated the game would be able to play solo. Because this is a fallout game and fallout games are predominately single player games and the Fallout fanbase is a single player game fanbase.
---
On behalf of all of us Noobs, I thank you! ❤ Players like you kept me alive when I got to Appalachia for the first time a couple of months ago.
---
that's what I get for typing in the middle of an op, thanks
---
Uh oh, I don't like where this is headed...
---
Required Trinity roles
---
N33+1Per (craparoony)
---
Make it so they only die to stealth attacks and we're even.
---
This is the reason I sit in chairs when I wanna smoke while playing
---
I once thought the exact same thing. But I realized that what I wanted was all cosmetic and had no bearing on whether I was good or bad at playing the game. As for the subscription, I admit it does give an edge in the game when it comes to storage management but think of it this way and I respect what you are say, Hopefully they will use the revenue to hire better devs that can fix the issues that plague the game and I am all for that and I hope you are to.
---
Yeah the ammo machines is an iffy subject. I won't comment on them too much as, basically, there's people right now who genuinely love the game who aren't geared correctly and NEED surplus ammo they can't afford to make.
---
I don't think that a single machine or two was game changing. However I never used one as I was a single shot rifleman and a chronic CAMP builder and didn't want ghost budget. 
---
My words to OP are 'hold on' as I believe the scaling up will occur at some stage. I don't think we've seen the end of balancing and it won't all be bad.
---
Currently digging my unarmed guy. He doesn't seem to be affected by One Wasteland much. Well, sometimes has to punch THREE TIMES, but hasn't died once. Solo'ed an Op but I wouldn't say it was easy. Went thru a lot of stimpaks. 
---
I'm dreading taking my rifle guys into an Op solo.
---
Yea still pretty useless
---
I'm pretty sure Bethesda is the reason Bethesda is going downhill. I'm also pretty sure it's more than just me when the Bethesda wiki has an entire section on the shit show of a launch FO76 was.I'm also not saying 76 doesn't correlate to the Fallout timeline, I said that had they not focused on making an MMO and instead focused on what they do best, the controversies could have been avoided. 22 proves that they have no idea how to balance a multi-player game. I've been enamored with the post-apocalyptic settings of both Wasteland and Fallout for decades. That's why I still play 76 and am also a First subscriber. I've probably been playing these games since before you were born.If you can't figure out that you can both love something and criticize something then you should remove your lips from Todd's ass and stop being such a fanboi.
---
I believe so.
---
Glad you commented, I read a couple sentences and downvoted until I saw this and realized it was sarcastic. It's great this sub is so active, but damn I'm tired of seeing these posts bitching about the new update ruining their game.
---
For all weapons that qualify. Shotguns and multi hit guns like fletchette mod harpoon, or heavies with high ROF &gt; 170. Limb damage, bashing damage, instigating, medics, stalkers or any piece of armor with block dmg reduction on it are magic and will increase damage in vats only, heavies  only after sustained fire on the same spot. Angry turtle has several videos covering the details.
---
 the atomic shop items need to work and look correct before new categories are added
---
In no way opposed to the idea though sounds cool
---
yeah well now it's that plus level 50 bugs wrecking your shit.
---
:D
---
Supposedly throwing daggers will kill them at low hp.
---
*scrip
---
I love On Wasteland, but it definitely needs another revision. Imo the enemies that should be lower level than  you (before the big patch), should at least be one or 2 levels below yours, so every fight doesn't feel tedious and long, it would help a lot.
---
So u want what was a great rpg series to further become more like Fortnight ugh is all I have to say, Floating camps are bad enough.
---
Just going by my personal experience.  My Bloodied pipe revolver used to do 558 base damage and now does 244.   The new damage is maybe twice that per shot of all the automatic I have.  RoF is 6 on the revolver and 91 on the automatics.  My gamma gun does more base damage per shot than the revolver and RoF is 91.
---
Very well said. I love a gruelling challenge, but I abhor the fact, that molerats eat lead like a tiger tank and blink into combat like fucking nightcrawler.
---
If everyone is an elite enemy, noone is.
---
Here's the thing. That's never going to happen. I'm not saying I'm against that idea. Just that it's never going to happen where they stop doing something or adding new stuff, before everything is fixed. 
---
That's just how computer companies work.
---

---
And with legendary perks
---
I’ll accept my gunslinger being nerfed into uselessness in boss fights if I never have to read a single post again about people in Earle fights not pulling their weight.
---
Sounds like your adapting to overcoming these changes. Have a upvote and my respect.
---
Do you need to have someone next to all three signals, or do you babysit first one, then the second, then the third?
---
Yeah it was until stealth took a massive hit
---
Junk Jet would be fun
---
Agree
---
Oooh, a stealth version? That's really cool! I've not tried stealth in Fo76 (not sure how it'd would even work for group play), but it is really nice to see them acknowledge and make content for the sneaky folk.
---
Look at the bright side. There are many more days of daily ops ahead. Keep at it and you’ll have everything.
---
Great post
---
Geez, I've seen this fail *before* Update 22 because no one gathers wood.   I think I'll just pass.
---
Maybe even....dare I say it...a Loadout Save/Swap option like the Armory in Diablo 3
---
When looking at player vendors on the map serums are listed as Misc.
---
Sometimes you will find gunpowder sometimes you will find a bunch of cheap serums
---
I keep expecting my luck to run dry and start getting dupes.
---
You read wrong. She still drops them.
---
Or play some music bitch!!!
---
This has happened here and there in the past, but it's happened a minimum of five times since this patch. On multiple servers, including two privates, I have been unable to farm squirrels at Whitespring because I hear their death screech before I even load in. Very frustrating.
---
Lol me on a banjo with a joint.
---
On a similar note I have avoided doing Ops for two days because I'm a stealth gunslinger and my Op for the last two days has been Resiliant/Piercing Gaze. Today it was Freezing Touch/Piercing Gaze so I thought I'd give it a shot but you literally can NOT sneak against Piercing Gaze. I have a stealth suit, 17 Agility, 3 ranks of Sneak, and Escape Artist and got spotted instantly and couldn't even loose them with a Phantom Device. I would have probably been fine if the mobs weren't so spongy. Mutant Hound survives a fully charged two-shot gauss pistol blast to the face? Guess I'm not playing this game anymore.
---
Tip.
---
Stand on car. Kill anything that doesn't fly. 
---
Took me 15 minutes to kill a Yao Guai last week, never fuckin touched me though the big soft furry bastard.
---
But earls twice the notes and a high chance at 90%RW scrip😁
---
I can see the confusion why though.  But once read it makes perfect sense.
---
I just hope we get more objectives other than "go to this location-&gt; wait few minutes-&gt;repeat".
---
That would be awesome. Swing me a DM of your gamer tag. I'll be on most of the day tomorrow.
---
She is sadly the weakest radio host in a Fallout game yet.
---
What a run on sentence.
---
Workshops are also PvP zones.
---
Take my up-*hiccup*-vote.
---
There are two signal thingys in each daily ops that need to recharge or whatever it is supposed to be doing. If 1 player stands within it's area of effect, it will charge up slowly with x1 speed, 2 persons will increase the speed to x2, etc etc.. So having everybody stand next to it will make the ops way faster thus almost giving a guarantee you will get Elder rank. With 4 players, if everyone stands in the are, you will finish the ops in 5-6mins or less.
---
Not buffing any weapons was the real offender here.
---
It made the divide between meta and everything else even greater. I love the update but I can see how its tough on others.
---
They really need to hunker down and start hotfixing weapons and look at the enemy health pools.
---
Why assume that? Rare is too dumb to go after the giant pile of money private SoT servers offers to them. Look how many Fallout 1st paid subs and ESO Plus paid subs (which doesn't include private servers but just QOL features) there are. Free money just sitting there with an established player base begging to spend their money on it, and exactly ZERO redesign to the game needed to implement it. And Rare is just leaving it on the table. You can't assume these companies are run by financially smart people.
---
Please can you look at sneak covert operative damage bonus it’s broken on PS4. Only getting base damage when sneaking. Many thanks
---
Yea before this update I turned my nose up at meta builds and mutations. I didn’t need to make the game easier, it was easy enough. Now I’m reconsidering my stance, after 20 months and almost 700 hours  and 205 lvls of playing I’m gonna have to actually sit down and rethink my build and plan it out, I’m going to have to finally start using mutations which is something I would never have considered 3 days ago. Any and every edge I can find ill have to take now. I don’t hate the changes they’ve made, in fact it’s almost refreshing not knowing if I’ll actually survive an encounter. But going forward I know I’ll have to make some changes to how I play if I want to remain competitive and not just be a waste of a teammate. But before I make any changes I’m going to wait and let the dust settle from this update and see if they make any more adjustments or hot fixes and see where my build sits then.
---
THIS I can get behind. Pure mayhem.
---
I'd have settled for 2 player co-op of Fallout 4....
---
This.
---
I drew the line at jetpacks.
---
 Perk Loadout Manager was released 2 december, so less than a month really.
---
It really need a damage boost and some other tweaks. 70% there.
---
You couldn’t attack while defending mate. that must have changed with the update just letting people know there captain obvious.
---
Yeah it’s been like that but I had nothing left to spend gold on that I wanted so I bought it so I can actually have my mothman jet pack or Captain cosmos. It was fun for awhile being I could use gold for other stuff
---
Just seen someone create one and then just sit in their camp for an hour. What?
---
Sounds like a ton of fun... For people who like to grind. Thank you for at least making suggestions about where to find things, but there are many gamers that don’t enjoy grinding to get basic items needed to survive, like ammo and stimpaks. 
---
It’s sort of like when someone enjoys a good pasta dinner, and now they’re required to grow the wheat and grind it to make the pasta. If they want olive oil, they have to grow the tree and press the olives themselves. Some people are really into that. Most aren’t. A lot of people have enough boredom in real life that they don’t need it in games, too.
---
&gt; u could have made ur walls out of foundations and they never woulda got in- have some foresight
---
Wow this would really be a brilliant idea if it weren't for the fact that foundations even without stairs attached have an invisible ramp that anything can climb. But... I'm sure you knew that already, Mr. Expert.
---
It might help if your melee weapon was a knife, ok, I realise you're not a fan of close fighting, but the speed alone might push up your damage per second. But this method will require good armor and a good supply of meds or food. Always keep an eye on your health with this style of play. Vampire versions will be a definite advantage.
---
Oh, and your username, Preacher reference?
---
Because previously for a lot of new players, a huge portion of the map was locked out due to enemy levels. Many were the tales of the lv14 that went to look at the golf course and got chased by a horde of lv 50 ghouls.
---
While you say the crimson bog was a challenge, for a lot of higher level players it wasnt a challenge at all. Thats not because they had an ultra tweaked build, simply because the enemies just werent much of a threat by the time you had a few perks/gear. At low level, a scorchbeast is a terrifying thing you hate encountering. At high level its a vaguely annoying bat. Many players lv50+ were reduced to hanging around west tek as that was one of the few places that spawned anything even vaguely appropriate.
---
Everyone's fun is subjective. You might find it fun to kill off low level enemies, while for others they're no threat, no challenge, and dont give any decent reward. So theres no satisfaction from beating them, and beating them is guaranteed.
---
Now it probably would have been better as a new mode, so it was optional.
---
This was my first ever DailyOp. Was able to complete solo, tho for sure I didn’t set any speed run records. Gotta say, it felt like the right amount of danger. Gave my Final Word a healthy workout, too, but getting some .50 back from the casualties was nice.
---
I've been noticing this ALOT after the patch. I swing my weapon they're health bar goes but they stand for 1 second or maybe half a second and I'm like wtf so I keep swinging. It's really annoying but atleast I'm not alone.
---
Gunsmith and whatever the other perk is for armor were a must before the patch anyways, put em on
---
As much as I would love it, that would require the radio being synced and equal for everyone, which in turn would mean actually streaming all those songs a trillion times a day for each server, which will never happen both because it'd be super expensive and the game would go out of business very soon, and you'd have to find a way to everyone hear the lines in the language they play the game in, which could be not the same for everyone on a given server, and even if you did that, it would require re-acting all the lines in all the language to make sure that the timing is right and you don't have overlaps or noticeable gaps between the end of the words and the start of a song.
---
It'd be handy for ACP to draw the spawns. I always get swarmed and have so far never managed to deal enough damage to Earle to be able to loot him.
---
Side note: any tips on the best weapon types for Earle would be appreciated. My gat plas and gauss shotgun both seem pretty futile (clean/full health build)
---
Its hard to know when to join. Very confusing setup.
---
RAIDER ARENA
---
god if a daily op is like survive 8 minutes of ghoul onslaught I will buy atoms for the first time in 2 years
---
This is why I ended up buying the jet pack I use to just have free states jet pack on with out knowing the plan but after the camo skin letting you do this I just bought it so I can have arm jet packs
---
They said they were planning to do a different type of event for Halloween. No clue if those rewards would transfer over.
---
No. Not only is it harder to obtain mats and ammo, but you have to spend way more to get them. There’s actually not a big increase in difficulty, just a giant increase in everything unfun and tedious. That’s the main complaint. There’s plenty of things to be positive about, but patting them on the back for 2 free fast travel points or whatever isn’t actually helpful. They claim to want our feedback, this update is a huge indication that they desperately need it.
---
All players should get a game refund and this nonsensical game shutdown.
---
These former low events needs adjusted rewards now or else they are not worth the expense.
---
Upvote cause similar situation except my one enemy spawned inside the wall. Too several minutes and nades to finally kill it.
---
Well there are always some people who do not know what they are doing. Or they could be waiting a friend or whatever.
---
Did you go into the season board to claim he rewards?
---
It could of also been a bug showing you level up for the levels you already did. NW is only 250 score.
---
If that’s true, I think I can work with that, I’ll have to pack like 600 throwing knives with me but I think that’s more viable then dropping their health with a rifle and then either bashing them or swapping to a melee weapon to finish the job. Thank you for the info.
---
I'm not sure this really counts as an 'exploit' more a bug of convenience.
---
This update made it so much more enjoyable. Enemies aren't weak and squishy now, and the xp is so good
---
Yeah, it looks cool. I doubt it will outclass any of the top weapons by too much but I wouldn’t mind poking enemies with it.
---
Just go rested butt and deep pockets. You become a tank.
---
Bethesda should just add in full respec in
---
Brahmin Milk??
---
My problem with your argument is that the wasteland was only unreasonably easy if you made it that way. Deathclaws always were scary to me, because my build wasn't especially optimized. Everyone that complained that the game was too easy had all the tools they needed to remedy that at any time they wished. You never at any point had to so much as equip one perk card, a piece of armor, or a weapon if you wanted a challenge, and you could tune your experience with the gear you did choose to equip.  
---
Now because some had to feel "challenged" even when they had tuned their build to easy mode, my medium build is now the Prepare to Die edition of the game unless I want to suddenly stop using 75% of my weapons and specialize.
---
Hmm it’s almost like there’s a giant problem with the new update that a bunch of people are in denial about
---
I’m on Xbox too if you can bring me the materials I’ll make you serums for free. I’ve got a couple marsupials on hand too. 
---
You can buy one nuka grape a day at the Whitesprings soda jerk, also see if you’ve unlocked the sun kissed perk it’s the one that heals rads per day
---
It's only september 17th...
---
And the meta shouldn't real change, you can still sneak and Daily Ops are just Daily Ops. Personally i think these builds may eventually start playing a lil more with the Legendary S.P.E.C.I.A.L perk cards to add a lil more resistance to there builds. 
---
But other than that, nothing really changed...players should still be encouraged by the "current meta" to go for a bloodied build. Personally i'm having no issue with any of my bloodied builds. I lost a lil bit of dmg, but nothing as drastic as some ppl say.
---
It's actually easy to solo this and get to Elder. But, still true when in a team; run front point A to point B cuz there's really nothing to see.
---
Thank you for being a valiant warrior even though you admit you do not actually have a problem. I suspect you have a lot in common with others who have joined the chorus of whining in that people are complaining about problems they don’t actually have but perceive others to have.
---
I'ts not "knowing about an exploit", it's  bug that you got stuck with if you happened to come across a medical scanner (or such like) out in the wild, without the quest being active.
---
Is that game fun now? I tried day one solo and was lost
---
Isn't this bad for bloodieds though?
---
What do you mean by "cannot repair"? It doesn't let you click the thingy or? You have to keep pressing/holding down the repair key (E on pc) until it is fixed, if you get a melee hit it will interrupt the repair. Also, are you on PC and using mods by any chance? If so, update them.
---
That is great to know, I've never participated in the PTS so out of the loop, was never in the loop tbh.
---
Singh is all I haven't had the chance to do one yet going off of what you're saying with what you get for rewards does that mean that if you do it in 8 minutes or less you then get all 3 rewards and can no longer do daily Ops or does that mean that if you do it in 8 minutes under a put you in to the 3rd gear if you go over 8 minutes that and automatically puts you in to the 2nd tier and if you go over 12 minutes that put you into the 3rd gear so you can actually run the daily Ops 1 time per 24 hours or you have the ability to run it 3 times per 24 hours
---
I think thats the idea about a post apocalyptic wasteland.
---
With Lvl 4 What Rads , Rad Shield and T 65 PA I can stay in the Blast Zone indefinitely without taking any rad damage at all.  Great for harvesting nuked flora and stabilizing material.  Looking forward to doing Scorched Earth in the Blast Zone now without having to worry about rad damage and taking Radaway.
---
They might, but they'll also add more pay to win aspects because people like you buy them.
---
The one wasteland update has ruined fallout 76 for me  and my dad... Enemies are way too powerful and the game isn't more fun because of it but rather frustrating
---
Sometimes I'm guilty of this, I'll make a group, start doing something and completely forget about the fact that after 30 minutes of waiting for players that these 2 or 3 blokes that just joined want to actually do the thing. 
---
If I even so much as see (IN DAILY OPS) on one of their names I'll drop anything, even midst quest to go there because I don't want to be a burden like that.
---
I'm trying out a PA stealth sniper build similar to yours and so far it's fun and effective. I still need to level up a couple of times to max out the sneak perk, but even at rank one I'm pretty tough to detect at sniper range (I installed the PA stealthboy mod, mostly for role playing purposes but maybe it actually helps.) My TSE lever action was garbage but an instigating gauss rifle works well.
---
The major difference between our builds is that I hybridize into heavy weapons instead of gladiator. Sniper rifles lag behind on damage per second for bosses, and one handed can't compete with heavy weapons in that respect. If you really want to stick with the melee (which I'll admit sounds like a lot of fun) you can do ok dps with a semi-auto fixer, handmade, or radium rifle. If you go that route, you should drop a couple of ranks of adrenaline so that you can take starched genes and get the speed demon mutation, the boosted reload speed helps those guns a lot.
---
Edit - Also, power armor degrades very slowly, there is no need to run power patcher. Traveling pharmacy will probably help you more than portable power. Batteries included should also be swapped in for power user once you've amassed a ton of fusion cores, which you will even running PA full time.
---
It’s is, by definition, an exploit as many people intentionally set it up so they didn’t have to do the quest.
---
Not in the way the Gutsys were targeting his Deathclaw anyway....
---
I might ditch the alt slot I kept for the stupid daily level up challenge during last season. Poor guy/girl always left the vault, ran to flatwoods, did a few quests, and got yeeted out of existence to let go and begin again. My main was only leveling once or twice a week based on how much time I got to play. So far, it seems my main gets 1/2-1/3 of a level per day of casual playing, and I was able to finish the challenge by just doing a daily op on my level 30 alt when my main was too far from it
---
Has anyone thought about the Fasnacht robots?? They're gonna get creamed by Suiciders and OP muties.
---
I have had a bug where it just keeps showing multiple score levels when i really only achieved one level.
---
it's a pretty good weapon. and it wasn't hit as hard because of its high base damage. comes with a bayonet, too. not that you need it. but still, looks cool.
---
the only downside is that it breaks relatively fast. and it's impossible to use as an auto outside vats, so it's useless against cloaked enemies.
---
Oh man. sounds like a Bethesda glitch for sure!
---
it's literally 80% for Elder tier, which is ridiculously easy to get, and you have unlimited attempts within the 24 hours.
---
Plus if you unlock all three ranks at once you have a change at 3 rare rewards in a single OP.
---
Come on. It can't get any better than this.
---
Difference is the Treasure Hunter event is an timed event, and Daily Ops is a permanent addition to the game. So you do not need to worry about getting all the rewards that much. It won't take long until all the rewards can be bought from player vendors (except plan for the glaive, which is the only item you can't trade).
---
PC.
---
I have a solution to one or your problems. Get rid of all your turrets, they take up an asinine budget and mobs don't attack camps that don't have weapons.
---
it's almost as if they did on purpose to retain players.
---
nah.
---
traded for the symptomatic which is the only thing I really wanted. but the spec ops suit is worth gold right now.
---
If you use rifles, pistols or melee you may need to respec!
---
Everything you said plus it goes *choo choo* and that makes me happy
---
My luck in this game is amazing! I mean it! Like, yesterday AND today's ops, I got nothing for completing all 3............... 🙃🙃🙃💔💔💔
---
I haven’t loaded in since the update, I guess I’m in for a time consuming situation with the Legendary Perks
---
I remember the handmade being unusable in Fo4’s nils world expansion became it had the constant firing sound bug that possibly never was patched, Brutal
---
Yeah, I think the prime receiver, which is single shot, is way better than the auto in this case. I like to run dodgy, so sometimes the action points are just not there to use vats. 
---
Didn't notice the breakage, but that might be because daily ops have reduced durability drain.
---
Yea, it is the only reward from the daily ops that can't.
---
Hell no. I don't play that game so don't really know I guess.
---
The gutter did too
---
Yeah, and Chally’s milk. 
---
For those brave enough to milk chally.
---
I have the option to repair by pressing X and I have tried holding it, tapping it, etc. The repeater will not repair for me. I will continue to try various other things. I am on PS4.
---
Couldent it just send a notification to your own in game system radio that a event has started(like how the UI shows a text notification) and then just que up the corresponding voice line to match that ping
---
The return of the instigating shadowed sniper and the Unyielding slicer.
---
I am a new player, just hit level 11, this game is freakin awesome so far, just doing my own thing, exploring and doing whatever quests I feel like, I haven’t followed any guides and I’m just putting points into whatever I feel is cool, but I am curious, will I suffer later because of this? Do I really need one of these so called “builds”? Can someone give me some info on that? I think the difficult has been perfect so far and I’ve done a few of the open world events with no issues. Can I focus on both melee and guns? Can I be a balanced player? I’ve mostly used perks on QoL stuff like lock picking, hacking, the med finder perk upgraded, and disease/food stuff. I think I like to sneak around a lot, what should I focus on?
---
They're all still easy! Except, that robotic of a b**ch... still terrifies me. And since I can't 1 or 2 shot her anymore, that laser beam she shoots out is even more scarier. 🤕
---
Sometimes it takes me a minute or three to figure out the best combo of item weight to script value ratio sell to get as close to 150 script as possible.  
---
Why doesn’t armor simply sell in 5 script increments!?!?!
---
Okay, I was thinking it would be like having 2 chances at it, one bad chance and one good instead of only a good one
---
Whats the new look?
---
I loved SWTOR back in the day!!! If I remember correctly, that game was a lot more friendly to solo players. Weren’t companions a thing in that game? I think you could bring them with you on flashpoint missions. Unfortunately, your only option in this game is to play with others. No companions in this one. Although, I think that it would be a good idea to have the ability to use companions until a player hits 50.
---
I’m really sorry that you’re not having a good time man. Understand though, I have two friends that are new to the game as well. In contrast to you, they’re having a blast. The difference being that I’m showing them the ropes and helping them with builds and modding weapons. I really believe that you’d be loving the game way more if you had something like this. In any case, I really hope this isn’t the end for you!
---
There's also the rad remove legendary perk. I put it on my level 35 alt.
---
Me too. I'm glad we got legendary perks at least now; I got the one that lets you have level 3 lockpicking and hacking without having to swap out my cards a lot, so it helped some. But I still really want them to swap between crafting and combat situations

This is an interesting solution, I must admit.
---
Yeah, I try that sometimes. It sometimes works but sometimes doesn’t
---
Don't let them use your loo 😁. And make sure you wash your hands 👐👍👐
---
Account bound Bethesda, come on!
---
if you know you are fighting robots make sure your are equipped for that in terms of perks, aid, weapons, and armor.
---
I upvoted you because at least you’re honest about using someone else’s build. When a game gives you the *option* to create your own build, though, it draws a lot of people that really enjoy experimenting on their own. So, when things are changed it affects them more than it would for someone that can just say, “Well, I guess I have to look up a different build now!” It feels like a slap in the face for people that don’t want to use, essentially, premade characters.
---
spam the ting ting on the desk :)
---
My main toon has yet to get a rare reward my 2 alts have gotten 3 and 4 rare plans. (1 double rare)
---
Vertibirds were great in F04’s survival mode for fast travelling though. Maybe a vertibird leaving Watoga &amp; heading for Atlas could be fun.
---
yeah, it was a bit tougher than i thought, but T65 with emergency protocols and bloodied minigun solved it in 7m55s.
---
Same exact skin as whistle in the dark
---
My bloodied DCG just doesn’t bring it home anymore. It got very specifically and seriously nerfed. My bloodied ss switchblade tho is kicking ass now. It feels like high dps weapons are the key, I’ve got an anti-armor death tambo that’s also pretty effective too. I picked up a bloodied explosive 10mm smg and it chewed through supermutants in the ops like mad and I have no commando perks. 
---
So things have shifted around but a high level bloodied build is still pretty badass. Equip born survivor. Chew through stimpaks. Kick ass. That is all.
---
Yea really disappointed.  If its anything like the fixer plan I'll never get it again.
---
A couple of places for lead: In watoga high school there is like 10 cans of paint.  At the pylon site by abandoned big town there is four or five batteries in the train.  Or just go to lucky hole mine.
---
Throwables?
---
It also comes with the calibrated receiver, you'll probably want to swap it out for hardened or powerful automatic.
---
Nah. What will happen is they'll either adapt and overcome or maybe play The Sims?
---
You still need to craft it, so yes, flux and every other component needed. You just don't need to buy the jetpack plan from the vault.
---
I moved my bloodied unarmed build that I wasn’t never using over to a bloodied PA heavy for ACP fights. Seems to work well in Daily Ops too.
---
You can run it as much as you want in 24 hours
---
Sorry to break it to you, but at this point they're not going to be adding anything. Development cycles are a bitch, they've got probably a majority of the team working on fractured steel, a few people planning out the expansion after that, and a skeleton crew fixing a backlog of bugs to have something for the next update. If they were doing anything new for halloween, they would have been working on that two months ago
---
I wouldn’t mind if we had an ATOMIC LOADOUT option where for 2000/3000 atoms we could have a second spec that we could automatically switch to.
---
I'm hoping we get the vault building kit from fallout 4, they gave us a plan for the Super Reactor so hopefully.
---
I am stealth comando and it just doe's not work, adrenaline still working but no sneak multiplier at all, not in vats or just aiming down sights, tried moving perk cards around, says it is working when not in vats but damage numbers say the same as when not hidden, broken completely for me!
---
normal play not in daily ops
---
Same here. Well, if you're ever on and you need help moving perks around send me a DM. If I have spare legendaries that'll help you with your exploration, it's yours.
---
Don't forget the Stalkers melee meta and those Ghoul Slayers gamma guns for WS Nukes.
---
A buried response to a reddit comment about how an event isn’t returning?  Nah that’s not half bad for Bethesda.
---
I loving this update.
---
Especially energy and heavy explosive (not the legendary effect) weapons. Also bash damage, so the minigun with a shredder attachment breaks in just a couple kills. My flamer broke two times during Radiation Rumble! 
---
Bethesda, if you're going to nerf damage, buff durability!
---
ya need a plushie? :)
---
This is intended or a bug? So these weapons are the nuts in VATS? Even bash damage??
---
I ran this one solo and was 14 seconds shy of the Elder reward so I said screw it I’ll run with a team.  5 runs and they were all somehow longer than my solo runs.  It’s not hard people.  Stay in radius!!!
---
I was running a level 7 alt last night and was afk at her camp. Came back to find level 20 cave crickets attacking her...level 7 being attacked by level 20 cave crickets! Like wtf? I had to get a team mate to jump over and help because there was no way she could have killed those by herself.
---
Really wouldn't mind the idea of Strutting down the street slow walking like some Up-himself Enclave Trooper ready to kill the next thing with two or more legs that decides to move.
---
I have BE, AAE, IE and TSE railway and I have distributed those to all my rifle/commando characters for this exact reason :)
---
exactly
---
let me ask something: can you craft the assault rifle? not the handmade. not shistle in the dark, the basic assault rifle. do you know the plans for it?
---
&gt; it's literally 80%
---
You say this, but I seem to be falling into that other 20% infuriatingly often.
---
I wonder why? Can you craft legendary war glaives with modules like the gauss shotgun?
---
That's what the game is balanced around. As counterintuitive as it is, you are disenfranchised by not relying on VATS for your main dps. You need to sink stats and perks into VATS to pull it off frequently, as well as pay AP to fire. There's no cost to firing ads or hip.
---
I have plaguewalker on my pc alt and it would kill a low level mole rat or radroach in a second or two. Now there’s no more low level crunchies anymore. I wouldn’t even bother with it unless someone posts about how it got a massive buff. Keeping multiple diseases to boost the damage actually became a bit of a chore.
---
I don't have a toilet.
---
Oh. I have a Quad Explosive in my alt's stash... maybe it's time to try something new.
---
For every good gamer with a mic, there are 10 kids blasting music in the background while their mom yells at them.  I’ll keep my emote.
---
I hope for a halloween event ! Don't make the mistake and don't add one. Everyone expecting to celebrate halloween in the game.. Personally, i prepared my base for the halloween and i have seen other players too.
---
I get it a lot with my Ultracite Laser Rifle since it has such a high fire rate, it'll kick me out of VATS when they're supposed to be dead, then I'll use a bunch more rounds making them really dead.
---
I planned on buying all the rewards. You're telling me I can't buy this one?
---
Build your camp by a junk resource pile
---
Use melee weapons
---
Workshops for basic plans and mats
---
Loot every enemy and scrap or sell their weapons 
---
Take off the auto stim perk and embrace dying until they fix the game
---
Step away from the machine while doing math. Once you figure out the best combo, feel free to step back up to the machine. Courtesy
---
I haven't played for 5 days
---
I only have a sniper
---
What's happened ?
---
Elder Maxon is disappointed
---
perk loadouts is when you want to switch perks on the fly. 
---
example: i have 3 perception for concentrated fire. but i want to go pick some plans or hunt some animals. i unequip concentrated fire and equip the other perks that give 2x plants and extra meat. but switching many perks around gets annoying. but with perk loadouts, just with a click (or 2) you can switch loadouts. for example, i'll have one for fighting and one for building/cooking/crafting at my camp
---
Laser Rifles actually work now too, seems the damage calculation change may have fixed Armour Penetration with Energy weapons.
---
I have 2 characters level 300 and 210 both set up for combat. I used to love roaming low level areas with an explosive pipe rifle just exploring and messing around. Now I can't do that because everything is level 50 to 100. It's just a constant fight everywhere you go. Plus this game rarely has single enemies it's always mobs. So while my build is the opposite of OPs I know exactly what he means. They should have left the weapons alone and just instituted one wasteland.
---
Such a bummer. What were the bugs that were so bad?
---
seconded
---
They had a whole year to fix the bugs, and no one thought maybe we should get on that? Just like all the many other bugs in-game, (ex. Fast Travel), it is easier to just ignore them and move on.
---
I’m guessing it’s not in vault 51. It will be at your camp most definitely. I’m hoping the building size is larger then the actual size of the camp but I doubt it
---
I bet they will give us a basic interior layout and then will sell alternatives on the Atomic Shop.
---
Like a simple hatch that leads to a cave like the Sanctuary Cellar would be the base free for all version, and a fancy Atom shop one would be a pre-build Contemporary Home like the Overseer's House.
---
nice
---
Lol wrong reply my guy.... They will probably see it but you may want to try again :)
---
yeah it does help, oh well...gotta wait longer i guess
---
Im on Xbox. Perhaps In the future, if there’s ever a cross-platform wasteland, we can meet up and hoard junk together! 🥳
---
Yeah it sucks having to put 3 sniper bullets into an ant.
---
you telling me you don't spam diluted stims?
---
I just keep the standard one, because he tells me I'm junk all the time. 
---
Always good to know my worth in the wasteland.
---
I have noticed this issue on Playstation when I was doing Daily Ops.
---
right?!
---
Mad Dog escaped again?
---
I got the Brotherhood Special Ops mask and the suit in one run.
---
Is that weird haha. I try to exclusively use super stims. When I want healing I want it fast and one button - since as soon as i leave combat healing factor kicks in.
---
Maybe I'll have to make spam stim a habit now...
---
Nice!, thats a perfect roll imo. The default magazine size is wimpy.
---
I see this may be a known issue but This is happening to me with both my I/e minigun and bloodied explosive gatling laser.  I have tons of fusion cores with 1 or 2 percent.  Sometimes it says I have over 100 bullets left in mini gun and it reloads
---
I remember seeing a screenshot posted with one of Bethesda's ITVs or something, and it seemed to look like a new CAMP module, that looks like a mini bunker entrance. So I had assumed it would be placeable like the CAMP, and then you interact with it and it takes you to an instanced interior you could build in.
---
However, they did say on the patch notes that there is a new "no-CAMP zone" outside Vault 51, "for future content".
---
So your guess could possibly be right.
---
I guess if you stored all your "valuables" rad shower ect, you could nuke your camp to destroy everything 100% then server hop and repair it all with the Contractor perk equipped at the CAMP module...I really wish repairing was a passive ability for camp allies though :l
---
Oh God I have had to defend a pack of yao guai from my workshop and my God PA ain't shit to these monsters, had to run and jump on a building lol
---
There's new music everywhere, I can't wait for it to come out on spotify with the rest
---
I'm guessing you're missing something, but it's hard to tell with this information
---
Had the pleasure of getting murdered by a beautiful glowing Deathclaw. I believed I could two shot it with my bloodied revolutionary tooth pick...the dinosaur kindly informed me that it was an apex predator. Bitch slapped me into the ground, my body hit the pavement and bounced.
---
I love this
---
Congratulations!!  Surprise Overseer is the best Overseer!  lol
---
My squad won yesterday morning, probably thanks to a well-placed nuke which took out a bunch of people in Morgantown, and the circle was still pretty big so I was hiding in the bushes with another teammate while our 3rd was on the other side of the river, all of us waiting for the circle to shrink down again.  Our 3rd saw movement, fired and killed the person, and suddenly our congrats screen popped up!  What a pleasant surprise!
---
I don't like spending the points on class freak, so I stick to mutations that really help, while having negligible side effects.
---
The worst was when I accidentally took scaly skin on my low agility junkies melee character, mistaking it for grounded. My action points ended up so low that I immediately stopped being able to move if I became overburdened. Had to reset half of my mutations to get rid of it.
---
what are you talking about? I'm still doing the same exact thing, scrip and gold everyday then I launch three nukes in under an hour. The only thing thats changed is that I've started crafting ammo again and thats not even hard since I made 46,000 ultracite 556 yesterday. The game is the exact same
---
Nope,  can't be dropped or sold at a vendor or put in a box. Just checked right there.
---
Idk why fucking people do this it grinds the shit out of me! Stay near me you idiot
---
I have that same issue with my Gatling plasmas and lasers, they will reload when the fusion core is still at like 50% which causes me to waste fusion cores
---
Heyyyy would you happen to be on Xbox?
---
Oh, still its pretty easy to get caps from the daily op. Its just shit its the same type of op
---
I tried a few time but still no option to enter the password and print a keycard pops up
---
I got the galleria signs and war glaive plan on my Elder run last night.
---
it's such a bummer. i crashed half the time on last year event but still, I'd rather have the event than nothing or some last minute thing
---
You *do* have 3 chances at it, but those chances happen at the same time.  If you get Elder on your first run, it rolls your 80%, then it rolls your 10%, then it rolls your 5%.  In theory you could succeed all 3 at once and get 3 rare rewards.
---
You are, wanna see my trade list? This is the perfect rifle for me lol
---
The glitch with the dead scorchbeast following you around has existed for 9 years all the way back in skyrim
---
It took you 20 minutes ? To do what finish the daily ops? Wtf
---
it's not a hot topic so I wouldn't know. but most people I think dilute their stims since you get a ton more in return, and spamming three of the little buggers is more efficient than a single regular one.
---
Symptomatic looks fun  to have, fingers crossed, I was wrong about comparing the event to the Treasure Hunters though.
---
That sucks.
---
I don't seem to get the drops that other people get (perpetually cursed with terrible RNG it seems, but I digress), so I just go vendor hopping to buy the stuff I want. It usually works out fine for me, but I guess I'll be passing on this one sadly.
---
Of course not
---
&gt; Dude i feel ya, and I'm a fucking medic buikd
---
Why? I feel like this game would have been a lot cooler with a tank/healer/2 dps meta for groups, but in reality that doesn't really work. There is no real aggro table, there is no way to do much other than fully dps the shit out of stuff. 
---
Now once you're high level and have plenty of levels and gear to throw at the game, sure I get experimenting with ... less optimal builds for the fun of it, but I can't imagine anyone doing that from the start of a character and being able to succeed.
---
it's massive just so you know. I wanted to put it in the corner of the seedy shed, but nope. the thing is almost as tall as the shed itself.
---
somehow looks smaller in silos I guess.
---
They don't feel like real boss fights at all, the loot they give is complete and utter shit and is totally useless except for the flux. On top of that boss fights seem to be even shorter than before one wasteland
---
I agree. Before the update my Two Shot Gauss Rifle was the best rifle I had and it wasn't OP in the Cranberry Bog. After the update I struggle to take down a pack of wolfs in the forest in a reasonable amount of time, not to mention the stim packs . I even tried modifying the gun with a prime receiver and its still lackluster. What do I do now? I cant find a better rifle.
---
I think you're right.
---
As soon as I got a two shot pump, I suddenly became a shotgun build. Sucks that it’s broken outside VATS though
---
If you are going to tackle these regularly Im GT: HasNoStyle
---
Nice, cant wait to try it out! Have a bunch of laser, ultracite laser stuff mouldering in the stash for the day that they are usable lol.
---
Seconded. As a Gauss Shotgun build, dense keeps me from taking a bunch of unnecessary damage
---
Wow I just made a post yesterday bitching about this...
---
Awesome to see these changes! Can’t wait!
---
Wait it’s caps OR scrip OR treasury notes? And the amount can be from 25-500? Damn I thought it was always caps so I figured this mode would be great for grinding out caps, but I guess not? (unless i’m wrong somehow)
---
Are you sure it's not just a visual glitch, I have had the same thing happen with lots of different guns, I have 50k of each ammo I use so I never really noticed if I am loosing ammo.
---
Not sure about the describing as “OP” but at least there is some challenge.

Could I get your reasons?
---
And if it shouldnt be - then the perk card should clearly state that SPECIAL boosts will not be reflected in Nuclear Winter
---
Would be cool. He's just living in some trash broken down apartment now. My guess is he will move to Atlas once the others arrive though. Probably plays more role in the story.
---
Big ikr. Ah well guess I have to go to the high schools and admire the halloween deco that's still up
---
Glorious!
---
Agreed. No way. If I'm honest I think some of the perk cards that exist should also go.
---
The game mode is already giving more advantage to the higher levels and you would like to give them even more advantage through their current pve main character level ? Think a lil bit more about that mate...are you sure lol ?
---
I have my main set up as a vats rifleman/commando by swapping the perception perks. Commando took a hit for sure, making  me use about 2-3x the ammo as before which is fine because of the legendary perks, but my rifleman build used to one shot most things while sneaking two without is now unusable.
---
Yeah! I never thought i was going to run out of asbestos! Lol, is crazy how often I'm fixing sh!t now
---
Oof yeah I know that feeling. Somehow the "random" mutation removal always seems to go through every one but the one you want to cleanse ;)
---
Just calling it like I see it. If someone is still apologising for bethesda's failings after everything we've seen them do, they are basically licking a boot.
---
Done this twice so far - first by myself yesterday and had no clue what I was supposed to be doing, second time today with three strangers and got it done under 8 minutes.  But now I know what the key is.
---
\*EDIT\* Nevermind
---
You seem to believe that doing one Elder run will give you 5% + 10% + 80% chance at a rare plan. I think not.
---
Doesn't matter if you on a team the new legendary perkslike follow through and taking one for the team benefit everyone around the person using them
---
😂👍 brilliant post!!
---
I must have that really low luck.. i have hit the best rank every time an still nothing.
---
Just check on top of all this you can't even sell the regular crafted war glaive.  They made this a very exclusive weapon.
---
5th time this week
---
Upvote because I like cats.
---
I use diluted stims. With chemist perk you crate 4x diluted stims per stim pack (just add purified water), super duper gives it a 30% chance of crafting double, so I just craft a ton of them once in a while. And of course have the 90% weight reduction for stims using the backpack mod or traveling pharmacy perk.
---
Actually been trying to sell them for 1 cap each, nobody seems to want to buy them. Doesn't really matter, I have no problem spamming the 'H' key to inject diluted stims.
---
Damn my character needs to bulk up
---
Yesterday there was someone complaining that they were spending 400 rounds on each mutant and the event was entirely impossible to clear any more.
---
Yesterday I got a ‘caged bulb’ lol, today ‘galleria signs’ 😂
---
Stick with it mate
---
Over Powered.
---
So how about less cars???
---
If pip boy light breaks stealth why not make it draw aggro
---
I was surprised despite all the stuff you hear here how I could finish uplink solo in 9.5 minutes with a non bloodied non optimized stealth commando wearing shrouded wood armor. It was kind of nasty and I spent the whole time running in circles around obstacles near the vault uplink but it worked, even though I couldn't hide and healing factor was worthless and fucking up my stims
---
Gt JrArevalo956  be on in a hr.making dinner atm.but I'll be on
---
What I'm saying is I'm not going and fighting a bunch of lvl 5 scorched and a lvl 10 deathclaw to complete those. I've got to actually do some work
---
It's almost like people can have their own opinions WOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWW
---
I said this aswell and got the same downvote treatment, im still only hitting around 50 point of damage per shot with my handmade, but im killing level 60+ scorched in 8 shots, so while everyone is on here crying nerf im killing higher level enemies faster than i was killing the lower level ones before, but apparently it doesnt fit the narrative on here that "game too hard now" so they just downvote
---
I know what it means lol, I’m just saying they aren’t over powered. You just faced a challenge but nothing that couldn’t be handled.
---
Agree entirely.  This was mentioned on the PTS only for silence to be the response.  After playing for two days as a forced Commando I have to say it is killing my desire to continue.
---
Shouldn't higher levels players get advantages for being high level?
---
Regardless the perk cards should clearly state that they dont affect your stats in Nuclear Winter. If I had know that I would have "wasted" the points ranking the agility card 3 times, and would have chosen something else
---
Each int point gives 3%. Ar 66 int you gain triple base xp.
---
Turrets scale to your level in workshops now. Time to start building those suckers!!
---
Also I feel like Exterminator is going to need to be turned on for Campfire Tales from now on. Might make a difference.
---
Lol  deepwa spanewash deepla blah
---
I dump about 30 stimpacks a day since I seem to always have too many of them. On PS so clicking and spamming stim means I stop moving my legs for the duration, since the thumb controls both movement throttle and dpad
---
I guess thats one reason I prefer super stims.
---
How about a mod where your character flips the enemy off after every kill giving you a buff to your next attack Lmao
---
I was 29 seconds out of elder on my solo run today, had 2 others join me and we did it in 5 mins 30
---
&gt; My problem is, I feel like I don't have the cards I'm supposed to at this point, am I doing something wrong?

Doing something wrong? No, it's a game, anything you do won't be "wrong". It absolutely is sub optimal though. But that's not a big deal it just means that it'll take a few more levels to hit your peak. You don't need to have the cards he listed right now, you need to start working on getting them. What he didn't mention is that even if you don't play a full on bloodied build, adrenal reaction is a huge damage increase, even with 50-60% full health and that's no where near risky.
---
Though, with the way the game just bugged on stealth (and it's done so in the past as well) I really recommend making a heavy weapon or full auto rifle character.
---
Glad I'm not the only one! My bloodied powerfist 1 star used to shred but now it feels very weak?! Thought I was going crazy. But my instigating SS mole gauntlet feels way better? swing speed is a must at this rate I feel.
---
Everyone can indeed have their own opinions. 
---
Doesn't mean those opinions are correct or even somewhat accurate.
---
Alot of enemies are difficult to handle now outside of a group.
---
I am. Who is Chally?
---
Updates rarely break mods, it's the mods that break the updates.  If you had the perk loadout manager installed, or any mod that modified the UI, you couldn't access legendary perks or the results screen for daily ops.
---
Nah, that's the one number I actually did calc myself, int gives you 2%
---
I have a non bloodied non magic shotgun build and I kill lv75 ghouls in 3 shots. I took What Rads and Take One For The Team. Both at rank 1. Helped me out quite a bit. Did the monster mash event with 1 death. But thats because i got swarmed by 6 ghouls aand i use a double barrel shotgun
---
Fuck Ward.
---
wot, the op builds are still op nothing has changed
---
I am sure it’s not, I am losing out on a ton of fusion cells because of this. I knew it happened with the Gatling plasmas/lasers but never noticed with my Tesla until now.
---
Most people need that much healing?! I dont run pharma farmer and have more stimpacks than I can ever use... enough to spam supers if I need to.
---
I shouldnt be surprised given how many posts were seeing of people struggling to the point of quitting!
---
I havent got anything :(
---
an ancient internet proverb is relevant here
---
**Pics or it didn't happen**
---
Unfortunately you have to turn to players, not Beth, to explain this game. Fortunately, we have players like Angryturtle!
---
I'm right next to R&amp;G station. Rarely got attacked but if I did it was a couple of level 5 ghouls or scorch. Not anymore. Constantly attacked by level 100+ super mutants. It's the greatest. NOT!!
---
The gutter cant be given away either. Cant be sold on your vendor either. It can be scripted tho
---
If it had happened to me I would have posted proof but I’m going on the words of others. Don’t downvote the messenger.
---
No. just common loot like ammo and chems are repeatable
---
They're personally targeting their whole player base!
---
Are pistols any good in this game? I honestly have only used pistols in fallout 4 survival just to cut weight.
---
Bit of a shit situation, I dont like PvP in this game (mostly because its not skill based but gear based) but they need to add PvP mode back in, why they just outright scrapped survival Ill never know.  
---
Like this game was leaked as a rust clone, and honestly, I think I would have been OK with that, at least as a different mode separate from adventure mode
---
After the BoS supply run I have about 600 stims. I also run vampire heavy. I can go a daily op without healing at all.
---
Add to that the new legendary ammo card. Every bullet is a mini stim.
---
Sneaking rifle builds are pretty common. Head over to YouTube and search for 76 stealth builds. 
---
I like recommending going the video route because you get a nice explanation of what perks are being taken and why, as well as perks that are not absolutely critical for a build that allow you to change them slightly.
---
I'm really enjoying running around with my Ultracite Laser Rifle, now the Fire rate increase on it and damage decrease from the standard one seems like it's worth using. (I run Rifleman so I benefit from it more than commando would, Commando ofc does better with the standard Laser Rifles for that extra Damage).
---
I'm running a Bloodied Ultracite Rifle with 50% Crit damage and 25% Less VATS cost, it's amazing to use, and I'm not even utilising a Sniper Barrel, I'm just using a Aligned Long Barrel with Prime Receiver.
---
Same deal with my Plasma Rifle except I am using an Aligned Sniper Barrel on my Plasma Rifle because,, that damage god damn! 
---
Either way, really, REALLY enjoying being able to utilise these now.
---
Not sure, I think I noticed ricochet triggering the vampire's effect, who knows what else it triggers. The cripple/stagger perks? Strangler heart poison?
---
I LOVE IT.
---
Shame there wasn't a way to give everyone in a public event some kind of shared xp.  Slower weapons could be used on the adds and the higher dps ones on the boss and everyone would be able to contribute in some way.  
---
Rifleman and the rest of the slow weapons still need a buff though.
---
It's  not like mods for this kind of game are cheat tools... well the lockpicking one kind of is but it's also pretty stupid and lazy.  All most mods can accomplish are client side tweaks to add/modify the ui or modify textures etc.
---
God I had a hard enough time trying to heal them when they lobbed molatovs!
---
I will say, with the right set up, a gauss rifle can one shot enemies at the end game without direct damage boosting legendaries.
---
&gt;!You'll be able to recruit at least one BOS member as your CAMP ally, Solomon Hardy, a combat medic.!&lt;
---
Grahm’s Brahmin
---
Man and I was literally thinking the other day, "Man havent heard too many complaints from the wastelanders lately." Welp that was too soon.
---
Wish the game had some sort of fusion core refiller.
---
What's "fermented ballsack juice"? Was that one of the options for the scorched disease inoculation? Now I wish I didn't name mine "my blood's in it!"
---
If that's what "fermented ballsack juice" is, I thought it displayed for each player as what they selected, because I've found "my blood's in it!" as a world drop.
---
I also have a ton on me, I think 300 regular stims on my alt and thousands on my mule. that I never got to diluting. healing factor really is that good. but if you're constantly running bosses or even the daily ops, you'll end up going through a lot of them.
---
i didn't. 
---
but everyday someone says the same thing. I've never seen any actual proof of vendor glitches. Not saying it doesn't happen and there is none but..
---
Not quite - they were waiting for me at my camp, and destroying it in the process.
---
I'll agree that the game was to easy but I think the difficulty would be much more a problem if I hadn't spent the last 2 years gathering mindbending legacys
---
Aah thanks for clearing it up!
---
Flux wouldn't have been in the bag, if you get given flux in an event, it gets deleted if it goes into a death bag.
---
Yeah im level 326ish, and I tend to just run in and start blastin, then just hit the stims before my health hits 0, kept me alive in most situations, the only things that actually fuck me are super mutants with miniguns because they drain health down faster then the stimpack animation can play
---
me in PA, drugged up and with a gatling gun: *i like those odds*
---
I would think so. Even though it’s game pass you aren’t on Xbox servers. You are on pc servers so your save should be on the Pc side and you should have access to it.
---
Well... who did you side with?
---
Thanks for listening, guys. I must ask though, please, avoid solely focusing on the mid-level players. I'm a FO 1st, level 240, casual/normie on 2 platforms, and my experience has been ruined along with many others across the spectrum of levels. There has to be a way to "balance" the game for *everyone*. Until then, I'm staying out of the wasteland. I have enough stress in my life, I don't need it coming from a game.
---
I really want to start a new character just to see how One Wasteland feels for a beginner, but all my characters are past 100+ lvls, their stash space stuffed to the brim. Really wish Bethesda sold character slots in the Atom Shop.
---
Imgur
---
It only stays with you during an event, if you die in a nuke zone without an event it goes into a bag!
---
What he said
---
Yes that actually is what happens. That’s why you can earn up to 3 Rare Rewards on a single run. You get 3 independent rolls. Not one 95% roll.
---
So, if you’ve not played the original Fallout you can’t ever understand or truly appreciate the franchise. 
---
Really? That’s as silly as saying that unless you started gaming on original consoles in the 70’s and 80’s then you can’t possibly appreciate games now if you only started gaming in the 90’s or later...
---
Meet at WS water fountain. "Parade" thru to the main entrance, killing robots and blowing things up. Also can spray graffiti on buildings, fork the front lawn, etc. Better rewards if you wore a costume. Was a great, don't have to think, free for all event.
---
Honestly, I am not seeing these issues. They might come sniff around, but they can all but lick me and I'm still hidden or in caution. I'm not seeing the sneak crit boost, but have no problem staying hidden with Sneak 3, Escape artist, and 32 agility.
---
Of course. I’m just trying to see what could potentially happen with this glitch magically re-appearing.
---
Because not everyone farms Ops for ammo. This subreddit usually represents the very active and involved minority of the playerbase. But even so, we constantly see questions that are ‘common knowledge’ to many of us.  Which means not everything is ‘common knowledge’. Look how many ‘where can I find X material’ posts we get every day, even though there are so many sources of that information online already. 
---
If they can’t be bothered to do a Google search or even to search this forum before posting a ‘redundant’ question, they’ll probably also just want to buy ammo fast and easy. 
---
There is a very large percentage of casual players that prefer to buy items instead of grind for them. This applies to plans, Chems &amp; Stims, even legendary gear. And it applies to ammo. 
---
There will always be a demand for ammo. Especially popular ammo like 5.56, which is often used as a secondary currency since there is no max capacity, compared to caps maxing at 30k. 
---
And if ‘Bulk Ammo’ ever becomes a thing, that just means the market will reach-stabilize to more accurate cap:round ratios. And in that case, having a larger stocks means more versatility to the merchant to set competitive prices.
---
IDK, how much you lookin' to spend?
---
It looks OK, but I'll still stick to the +1 perception from the tattered dress, until I find some other outerwear that provides a bonus. I'm a little surprised I don't see more people wearing the dress. Also, if you compare the BOS special ops suit to something like the BOS beret, the texture is VERY low quality. I'm going to sell mine.
---
Has this been tested since it went live? People on PTS said it did. There’s a comment from 8days ago stating it does. Trying to get confirmation before going all out in explosive legendary perks and demolition expert.
---
Same with me on my new character yesterday. 4 times it took me to complete the mission.
---
One can get each tier once a day
---
Grab a secret service jetpack put it on a weightless or unyielding piece and just equip it when running around, it's loads of fun with melee.
---
This is all rumors. No proof has been posted anywhere.
---
I love when she's still talking shit to you as she drags her lifeless legs after her.. LOL
---
I’ve done it 4 times in a row. I got the rare once but I’m getting tons of legendary garbage. 1 or 2 per run
---
I’m not bloodied or even that good of a player and I’m doing fine.
---
Sorry to hear that, no luck getting Elder rank or just "Bethseda"?
---
Me too.  So far I’ve only received two plans both vault 94 stash trunk lol
---
So are uncommon rewards in the same boat the rewards? Are can you get those anytime you complete the ops outside of the first time?
---
No adventure perks carry over to NW...
---
I have a junkies stealth sniper, i two/three shot most of the mobs because of max follow through.. i dont consider my build optimized as my leg armors are all over the place(cant craft that amazing 3* ss armor) i just like what they did with one wasteland.. i dont feel op(not really into the bloody build so i dont feel op regardless of the nerf and other stuff)
---
I saw one miss monaganah yesterday. Then a second one hit it 15 minutes later while I was doing daily ops.
---
I respect your opinion. I just feel differently. Cheers.
---
I'll be honest, I haven't built anything in my camp for months
---
&gt; How are you supposed to do this now? 
---
Not solo? I mean this IS an online multiplayer game...
---
I think it's more of an issue that prior to this update essentially every event outside shit like PP and the bosses could be cleared with little difficulty by a single person and having even one or two others show up entirely trivialized the experience.
---
What's Imgur ?
---
Kind of like KY Jelly and the Astroglides doing synth pop.
---
Ummm you don't... Trust me... He's annoying as all fuck.
---
How do I rest my butt?
---
Yeah the bears swinging 4 attacks at a second and all of them are lethal this is exactly why I left bloody heavy
---
If OP is on XBOX I will gladly replace his Marsupial when he gets to LVL 32
---
Yeah, when I first met him I thought to myself "Why is an elite member of an elite military organization living like a bear with furniture?"
---
Ok awesome. I'll take down your reddit username for the future if that's alright. It would save me a bunch of caps!
---
That would discourage new people from playing Nw, it’s already a scarce game mode
---
Well in that case since it’s permanent, I’ll wait till loot floods the market and become worthless :)
---
Yeah I see many an event failing in One Wasteland where you need to protect shit.
---
Have you actually built one without the plan?
---
War Glaive plan is a rare reward from ops, moda are gold bullion purchased from Regs.
---
And only once per day per successfully timed run do you get a rare roll. I also didn't get anything from the rare rewards today
---
They were fun pre-nerf. Harder than other builds. You needed a vats/crit playstyle. But vats is broken for the top tier pistols and while you can get by now by sneaking for most of the game they are useless for bosses.
---
Buff them up a bit and fix that vats issue and they’ll be a great build again. Not remotely OP if that is your thing but fun.
---
I appreciate your response. It’s disappointing, because I’ve been hyping it up to friends I’ve convinced to jump back into the game after being disillusioned after beta/initial launch.
---
Whatever you do, if you reintroduce last year’s unique plans and outfits, please do not lump them into huge loot pool of potential from both the Holiday Scorched/Treasure Hunters events. Everyone isn’t clamoring for Plasma Grenades and Mounted plans anymore since they’re available for purchase in every player vending machine.
---
I know thats why i want it becouse my camp is one big vender hahahaha
---
I've had it give me a brand new server when two of my friends were still in the old private server, I was only changing characters to do this very trick.
---
The people who hate this update aren’t meta builds and were never one shotting. This shows your own skewed perspective more than anything. I have a more than great rifleman build that sucks now. I would have killed to only need a few shots on a boss before this update. Think about other player types and other builds beside yours.
---
Then there's also the fact that you can use chemist/super duper to get a ton more of diluted stims(or radaway)!
---
If you do decide to get rid of the mutation, when you get to LVL 2 Starched Genes I’ll give you the serum.
---
Just not for me I'm afraid. I need pneumatic on my chest as staggers get frustrating, plus the bleed damage/stealth benefits are too useful, especially after the latest patch. That's something for my Junkie.
---
OK, that makes sense now.
---
Radium rifle is ass on any build lol same with the assault rifle. They need either higher base damage or a higher RoF
---
Can always decrease a special for the perk and add true points to your agility. My problem is that I removed charisma points to be replaced by the legendary. Legendary cards do not increase the value of the special. I can't share higher rank cards.
---
And random legendaries I believe
---
I love building and it makes me sad that we haven't gotten more building updates.
---
Personally, I'd like to see workshops behave kind of the way CAMPs do - for example, you could take, say, Hemlock Holes workshop and build it up, and when you leave the server, your build goes away. Then, when you load into a new server, if you go and capture the workshop, your previous workshop build loads in so you can continue to work on it. Would give builders an opportunity to have a bunch of neat builds without having to move CAMP all the time. I'd love a chance to have different build styles and use all the cool stuff I have. As it is, I'm getting to the point where I question why I should buy more CAMP stuff from the Atomic shop, because I don't have room for the stuff I already own.
---
I do believe it’s all smoke in mirrors but you never know. It is Bethesda we’re talking about after all.
---
Yeah and if I had known the legendary perks didnt affect my stats in NW I would have done this.
---
Now I have wasted 75 levels of points and at 450+ it takes forever to regain those "lost" levels
---
Yeah I know your build is preferring the thorn set, I'm just suggesting it for exploring and climbing as it's a huge quality of life improvement, if you put it on a weightless piece of secret service it's only 1 carry weight, so you can just put it on and take it off as needed!
---
I would gladly accept a bounty if only it were possible to kill that annoying fucker. When he starts humming I want to smash my head against a wall.
---
Holy shit...trying to populate my store is a nightmare right now. Every time I try to add a new item it's like "ITEM BEEN UPDATED BY SERVER" over and over again.
---
Whoa whoa slow down there murder hobo
---
It was explained earlier in the post, but it looks like it got deleted for some reason. Dunno why tho. To Bethseda they're all rare, but we players attached uncommon and rare to them based on datamined drop rates. So, I guess if you are lucky you can roll a drop from each level you acquire.
---
There is kind of taunting at least in boss fights, Earle and Queen will both aggro on whoever is doing the most damage to them regardless of stealth. But you won't be doing the most damage at full health so yeah we need some taunting perks
---
yeah, they added a lot of team based on content with the new random team matching system, but for those who still want to play solo, it's been a bit of a slog.  
---
could even add in a separate perk card for solo damage boosts if they want.
---
I cant even find enough bullets to do anything. :(
---
I really like vampire/heavy weapon.  Good dps for trash enemies and you won't die.
---
Fair, good idea 👍
---
you need gun fu tbh. even just rank 1
---
glow sight is situational. i only put it on for radiation rumble. 
---
you'd be better off losing lone wanderer getting class freak 3 and more mutations. Herd mentality and empath are better than lone wanderer. they work if you're alone in a party.
---
But he gives sugar bombs, which are amazing for leveling up during the seasons.
---
Thank you so much! 
---
I guess it notifies you when the first one is done charging?
---
Not to my knowledge. Some rewards from last season will be purchasable with gold from Regs if I’m not mistaken.
---
Technically, they could set One Wasteland with a difficulty slider. Each tick adds 50 to the level cap of enemies. A level 300 deathclaw to you on very hard would be level 100 to someone on easy mode, just like it's level 25 to a level 25.
---
I joined, did an op, and couldn't leave my group or make a new group after I'd left the finished OP. It was giving me social options that you'd see for selecting another character. Felt bad because they all went in another OP and I couldn't free up a spot until I left the server and joined another.
---
Just remove the gauss shotgun and it would already be a lot better.
---
Fyi, I did finally spend some script for the first time. Got a 3 star, bloodied lead pipe, with 40% swing speed and 90% reduced weight. Its not god tier, but its not bad for my first try.
---
Even if you unlocked them and didn’t claim them?
---
Maybe not that great for a max level with sweet gear, but while leveling up a fresh character, it's nice to maybe get some legs your level you can use.
---
I don't think that they changed it.
---
What if I unlocked the rewards last season just never claimed them?
---
I have heard that some items will be unlockable using Gold Bullion
---
So it essentially could be a switch out timer? Like 5 minutes give-or-take.
---
Never done a whole lot of research into how the private servers work but when I do run the trick, I do it as fast as I can.
---
Never had a network outage or the likes whilst doing it so there well and truly would be risks.
---
but has it though?
---
That was happening to me today too .... Shots hitting target would restore some of their health, like a "reverse vampire"
---
It’s definitely doable. I’m a stealth bloodied commando. I just swapped out my stealth stuff for adrenaline and evasive. Threw on barbarian for good measure. Just need to be a little more careful is all. That and understanding that your not going to be a beast and focusing on being a team player.
---
I’d contact Bethesda support and see what they say. I’m gonna guess you’re shit outta luck though.
---
I to would like to know this. Have never managed to find a description.
---
No, it's for low health builds, one diluted stim is all you need
---
Only reason I do this is because I seem to find incredibly more stimpacks than super stims, and I don't feel like finding all the ingredients to craft super stims. I also play almost exclusively solo and get the shit kicked out of me and panic-mash the health button, can't afford to waste higher quality stims.
---
Also there's shittyness with injecting stims on PC, seems like in the middle of fights with my gatling weapons I sometimes have to hit 'H' like 6+ times to get a stimpack to inject.
---
Maybe if it was more reliable to quick-inject stims during fights, I'd be more apt to use higher quality ones. Until then, my preference is to spam easily craftable diluted stims.
---
I play a jack of all trades, except assault rifles, pistols (altho tank killer effects pistols now), or anything ranked in perception with a 14/3/9/8/14/13 sort of build where I can minmax and/or do QoL, shotguns, heavy guns, melee, stealth, vats, non-vats, pa, non-pa. That said, I can do bloody but been running 40-50% hp, and still one shot things but also need to two shot others. Depends on RoF. Shotguns have been great, heavy guns fine. Haven't messed with melee much yet, but idk. Vamp shotty or vamp mini are essential. Got a vamp deathclaw gauntlet too. Would like an instigating shotgun or maybe instigating/furious/antiarmor/twoshot explosive. It's nice to be a little out of bloody just cuz... It did feel generic being that low of health, ya know lol.
---
I recommend throwing in party boy/girl in charisma as it means you can get a massive perception boost from sweetwater's special blend. Also learn to make company tea for ap regen.
---
They show a lot of furniture off that way, it’s not just with this bundle.
---
I hope she'll invite Grahm, Meg, Paige, or the brotherhood
---
How’s you like an axe to the face?!?
---
CAUSE THATS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE YER AXING TO GET!!!!
---
shits gone yo.. a few things you can buy with bullion thats it
---
Yes you had until the start of the new season to claim them
---
I was within the 5 minutes time allowance and had people in the server, just be aware that it glitches out and you can loose access to it at any point.
---
just play on a team but don't interact with them.  You still get all of the bonuses.
---
Bethesda has had this issue since launch. Bundles promoting items that aren’t actually included is only one of the shady marketing tactics they have used.
---
More importantly it can give legendary scrip
---
Once you repair the booster ignore the enemies and run straight to the signal booster and fight there do not move from that area for ammo etc you can do that at the end. Once you have done that booster run straight to the next no matter what’s in front of you. If you have a good team behind you you can do the ops in 5.5/6.5 mins but you must all move to the areas straight away don’t keep fighting it doesn’t work just slows you down
---
Nonsense, this is fortnite 76. im going to jump 8 meters into the air and float with birdbones for 10 secs. by the time I land they'll just be bloodymess
---
Yup, 20 mins start to finish. Between an unoptimized build that relies heavily on stealth, my first time in that vault, my first time running an op, and doing it solo it took me 20 mins. Is that a problem for you? It’s not like I was dragging you or anyone else down, did you just write that to brag about your time or try to make me feel bad? Cause it kinda makes you look like a fucking asshole.
---
Pimp strut!!
---
Like they’ve all said yes once a day for the rare rewards but it’s once per day per character if anyone was wondering that bit.
---
Or they optimize the game...
---
I want it to come back. I NEED the Halloween suits for my newer chars.
---
Im on board with some of the changes they've been making, but im definitely not holding my breath  with any BoS DLC coming this winter 2020. If by winter they mean the first 3 months of 2021 then its a possibility. When you start pulling up all the old roadmaps is when you see just how delayed the content is. This is why im screwed with perk points, boredom led me to run tests and try new builds. Its mind boggling how loadouts are coming out way after legendary perks. Thanks for the loadout option now that I have 20% of my cards left and am stuck with 1 build, sound logic bethesda
---
Auction House would be badass. Not sure what Bethesda would do with the vending machine though. A lot of work and effort was put into them.
---
I think they're going to work on balancing stuff now that this skeleton model is out.
---
I was about to send the Link to the Perk Loadout Manager, then i noticed you are on PS4... bad luck :/  
---
( leaving the link here anyway: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) )
---
I really like that’s they give away caps with daily ops I think the rewards are 100-500 which means I can finally farm for the fixer pretty much daily
---
You do realise that you just dropped all content that you'd planned for 2020 for probably the next 4-7 months. Basically the effort put in for the foreseeable future is about as much as turning on and off a light switch. Oh, and that new bomb drop thing. That's it.
---
How is it that you guys can't even stick to your own deadline where pretty much a whole third of your content can't be delivered? Hell, the first third of this year's roadmap is the last third of last year's content.
---
Either do better to stick to deadline or just don't lie to us and just say you're only doing 2 seasons a year - 1 story DLC and one filler DLC.
---
What team type gets you a damage bonus to everything? Asking for a friend.
---
What do you expect from a deserter?
---
You'll have to scale back your camp since turrets take up a good chunk of budget.
---
I would put in at least one rank of concentrated fire so you can target specific limbs
---
My unarmed melee build was my fastest time at 6 minutes, just sprint and stim, use walls to block ranged hits!
---
Bummer :(
---
Heal the Brahmin with Friendly Fire/Shiskebob. Game mechanics are hard.
---
Any team type.  It's the perk Strange in Numbers, along with the mutation Adrenal Reaction that actually give you more damage.
---
I drop items between characters in my private world all the time and haven’t lost anything yet. Just switch quickly
---
There are so many actual problems with this game, maybe they should fix those first....
---
What's wrong with VATS? Sorry don't know what you mean
---
I laughed my arse off when I read the whole “NOW I HAVE TO SHOOT IT TWICE!?”
---
He also squawks at migraine inducing levels like a wounded pterodactyl. I'd have two Deguerres over one Fasnacht Collectron in terms of annoyance scale.
---
You're on the same fucking team. Go loot it.
---
I completely disagree, it is the exact same for me as before. I always come back with more stimpacks than I use especially during Earle and daily ops. I still sell way more junk then I'll ever use. No point in picking up ammo if it isn't 45 or 556 anyways. Not sure what your thing with lead is about. Daily ops only burns through a few hundred rounds of my ammo and I easily make more than that back by what it drops. 
---
Sincerely a level 400 bloodied stealth commando, the only thing one wasteland changed is that it made it harder for new players
---
yeah that makes sense, i guess from the stand point where you put so much time+effort into a character, having to seriously altar that wouldnt be too fun
---
Oh that super mutant lol idk if I do it is he gonna fight me.
---
I am loving it.
---
I’m actually enjoying it but I am a heavy build so that probably why and since these ops started your certainly seeing more PA users now
---
I got you.  Took me a while to wrap my head around it too!
---
.... Why?
---
I haven't had to change my build whatsoever for these daily ops at all. They are all pretty easy and my team constantly get it under 6 minutes
---
I have a B2525 Plasma Rifle with the flamer barrel and it's insane now! Ammo pig though.
---
You are free to cripple yourself with a poorly optimized build, but please don't come here and complain about how hard the game is when you're refusing to play well.
---
backwards. It's foodbuilds crying that now they have to think, and can't just take whatever dumb perks they want and stumble into success.
---
That's a good idea. Would still need an overall minimum damage requirement, though.
---
This actually happened to me with my comics I'd moved to my stash. I seen it pop up I'd sold some and I didnt remember setting a price for them at all. Especially not for as little as I ended up getting. Was rather bummed but thought I'd just somehow messed it up.
---
I was away
---
And also making entire categories of weapons even more useless
---
No. He is specifically saying the opposite. He is saying you DO NOT have a 5%+10%+80% chance at a rare plan. He saying, instead, that you have a 5% chance, followed by a 10% chance, followed by an 80% chance if you do one **single** Elder run.    
---
It doesn’t matter how many times you run it in one day. If your highest run for the day is initiate, you have a 5% chance for that day. If your highest run for the day is Elder, you get all three chances for the day. The only difference is what time of day those rolls are done.    
---
You have three dice for the day. Each one has a chance to get a rare reward. Each one only gets rolled once per day. If you get initiate, you get to roll the 5% die if you haven’t already rolled it for the day. If you get Elder, you get to roll any/all of the three dice you haven’t rolled that day.
---
Grabbed a AA +10% Dmg Ultracite Gatling and I'm currently loving it. Only gotta worry about cores with my build.
---
That's true. Don't gauss weapons benefit from demo expert, though?
---
My name for liquid courage, since it needs a colossus vocal sac to craft and people have been putting them in display cases as giant testicles
---
Earl post nerf is...painful. Pre nerf my friend solo'ed Earl in 5 and a half secs. Now he has to use his bloodied heavy guns and it took him 5k ammo and 20 mins.
---
If they want stealth snipers to do extremely well, the first step is to remove the timer.
---
The second is to make sure legendary effects and legendary perks aren’t required to pull off what’s being asked.
---
Respecing on the fly doesn't usually mean needing to level up every time they want to move a perk point.
---
What mistakes? I want to try the different legendary perks when they're maxed out, then pick the ones I like the best. I can do this with regular perk cards, why not legendary cards?
---
Do people really need notes though? Most people I know are sitting on insane amounts of notes. And practically everyone is sitting on enough stuff to scrip for at the very least a week+
---
And no I dont have proof of it happening but honestly I have no reason to lie about it.
---
Noted, thank you.
---
May have possibly been because other folk were utilising your server that it glitched but I’ll be sure to be a tad more cautious about openly just throwing my entire legendary stockpiles on the ground.
---
I have found that even one or two is enough to make a difference since they are level 50, even the starting turret. It's true that some people will have to make some room in the budget, but at least they are useful now.
---
Also, you did say workshops, not camp lol.
---
Have a seat!
---
Keep in mind how active this sub is. I sort by new and can't keep up. The question and thought you've had isn't unique, and plenty of other people have been asking similar questions. It clogs up the sub with useless posts when nobody ever posts anything more than "I heard this exploit may be a thing...". The people that you heard it from have told many other people who have already spammed the sub with questions about it.
---
Until someone actually posts any sort of evidence, these posts are useless, not to mention repetitive, redundant, and posted over and over again.
---
I've never experienced any such thing, nor seen it, nor met a real player who's experienced it.
---
I also don't fuck with mechanics, exploit the camp budget, build in the aether below the map... Ya know, things likely to *cause* such a thing.
---
its not good for bossing
---
I have 3 gauss pistols 11. an instagating 2.a furious and 2.an executioner through which i switch depending on situations 
---
for the most part on earl i focus the adds so the heavy gunners can deal the actual dmg on the boss, on SBQ my main issue is the range, i usually have to wait till shes down on the ground and just stick to the executioner. 
---
I just dont have the sheer dps of a bloodied plasma caster/gaussgattling etc so i stick to support and just BSSSSSPEW the adds down and try to get to 2% dmg so i get the loot from SBQ :D 
---
what most vats builds dont use is razorgrainn flour, it gives you back 60 AP over i think 5 seconds?  if you are in a bad spot / had a lot of bad luck with AP refresh from perks, you can keep in the  fight with that. 
---
Also my istagating one is vats enhanced and i have high perception i get REALLY good hit chances for the head, and since its lucky (faster crit meter filling) i can crit on every 3 shot at worst + headshot + instagating = everything thats not a boss just vaporises, its a VERY VERY fluent use of vats that i miss on rifles on occasion :D
---
TL;DR: Dont use it as bosskiller, it can oneshot legendary mobs tho so be careful or people wont like you :'D
---
&gt;I think it’s a bad idea. This is a post apocalyptic world. We use caps as currency for god sake.
---
Uhh...so?  There are still functioning parts of society. 
---
&gt;  Also, there are so many items that are worth more than max caps anyway, I wouldn’t want to be limited to 30k. 
---
Then don't sell them.  
---
&gt; At the end of the day I enjoy having to hunt for those cool items. I don’t like being able to just buy top tier items just because I have the caps. 
---
Then don't buy them.
---
Plasma Rifle Flamers are dope as all heck,
---
I’m repping a B 25FFR 15Reload speed one and it was AMAZING during the OPS with the robots that needed to be finished off with melee
---
Four Leaf Clover in luck is clutch for shotguns 
---
Crit Savvy could help too 
---
I assume this is a non stealth build?  You’re only using combat/Gauss?  Or?
---
I know that they’re creating Instanced Camp interiors as part of Season 3 which could help with building limits
---
Do you know what PSA means? This isn't an attack towards you, he is teaching you what to do.
---
You've probably seen for yourself by now, but the new higher level creatures look the same as their low level counterparts. For example, Morgantown has level 50 "weak feral ghouls". I was wondering if higher level players would see charred feral ghouls instead, but I guess showing a different skin for each player would be too much to expect
---
Because at the time of writing the original post i had done three ops with three different teams, and every time we did we skipped out on the elder role because people kept running off while we were at the damn signal booster
---
Like I said. Ain’t ever ever going to happen. Not that I’m against that idea.
---
But they will always do both. Fix things and make new content. 
---
They could take a whole year and do nothing but bug fixes. And it still wouldn’t be bug free. That’s just the nature of games like this. 
---
And if they stop putting out content, the game dies much quicker.
---
Wish it was always a three star weapon cuz dont nobody want no lame ass armor
---
Personally I'd only trust person to person for anything precious, but if its easily replaced then put them in a world container [not a bag] then go for it.
---
Yes there will be a notification and the objective will change
---
Bethesda's MO is to promise something and then deliver it late and broken.
---
I know these new events can be nerve wracking for low levels. It can be a bit of an overload when you are disoriented and getting completely massacred and don’t know where you should be going. Don’t worry if you’re a bit lost at first. You’ll figure it out and then you’ll be the one helping other players in the event. Just try to keep at it!
---
I took 3 legendary perk slots to add special points to my build and max out dr perks. I’ve only used 4 of my 6 slots cause I’m still debating but even with using three that’s an extra 12 special points you can get for barbarian etc. Haven’t tried it much yet but I seemed way more tanky in the brief period I did.
---
Its been happening to me on my handmade rifles for a while :[ 
---
Tried switching to a different magazine size and that didnt even help.
---
That and a combiner for when you have 2 or more fusion core that aren't full
---
Viable to grind out end-game content, perhaps. This isn't Rust or Ark, nor did it ever claim to be. I've played without any optimizations since before beta, and have dropped nukes, fought the queen and earle, did the wastelanders vault raid, etc. Somehow, I managed to get to level 240 and was happy playing the game. So, I reject your premise as a blanket requirement to play Fallout 76.
---
 They literally announced perk loadouts at wastelanders launch, and it comes with the BoS update. Unless of course you mean ones that swap special too.
---
Because they're meant to be top tier.
---
Every time I get a new Fallout game, I always look forward to finding a fat man, only to remember that I have no use for one
---
Just use unyielding armor and you'll always have an extra 30% xp boost
---
This  Was true, but it is no longer true! This is good.
---
Regular perk cards do not apply to nuclear winter, so why would these?
---
The game literally tells you what to do. Not to mention, it should be common sense to play the fucking objective, this shit’s literally no different from playing capture the flag on halo or something, you just sit on the point and hold it until the game tells you not too.
---
This is a conspiracy theory:
---
But do you think that Bethesda might have canceled the event because of the political climate and what is going on right now in the US?
---
They do, but I’ve been managing even without.
---
This is just about every bundle. There's one item pictured that people get hyped for and then it's not included. If they wanted to learn a lesson, they already would have. This is intentional at this point.
---
I’m genuinely in love with the mechanic. It fits so perfectly into the game but it’s still so very barebones, and it has enormous potential which in my opinion detracts from an otherwise very enjoyable experience
---
Try running a primed railway rifle in a daily op. Brought me back from the brink.
---
Sometimes we might even have to work together in a TEAM to achieve something! It as an outrage!  XD
---
I thought by now they would've at least removed "beta" from the menu screen and accepted that it is what it is
---
Some bastard stole my flux yesterday then....
---
I was just joking about melee I mean like is there a perk that stops rebuffs
---
Oh look, another post that straw man's the other sides argument and complains in the exact same, nonconstructive way.
---
Looking forward to this being the norm on this sub for the next month...
---
In some games you can benefit from starting a new character and using what you've learned to make it easier,  but FO76 isn't really like that. It's better to push through it and adjust things as you go.
---
Radiation Rumble
---
Love the idea of a slider. Was thinking of the teams as a way to get groups of people to be together at the same "difficulty"
---
Alas the Fixer only supports the skin from the legendary run, any other skin it just stays the default green.
---
This made me feel better when I looked at the comments realized this was sarcasm at its best tanks and what bloodied weapons did over 400+
---
Very nice. 
---
I can make gunslinger work fine, but it really does require the right legendary effect cocktail.
---
No they should absolutely not revert anything, that's a horrible idea that I disagree with completely.
---
This update is too much I can’t even put holes in a death claw with a drill 😡
---
I did that one too. They were in the cranberry bog and I left the alpha alone....I died a lot... But I cleaned up on bear meat!
---
Adios
---
I hope they do cus i want to switch to rifleman so I can have a taste of both but I need an excuse.
---
PA build also, having a blast. Personally I love running around feeling OP but I know some like more of a challenge, so it’s cool they will be mixing it up so much so everyone gets a chance to really enjoy their play style.
---
As far as I currently know there is currently no way to stop the cyro debuff
---
There's nothing to fix because there's nothing that's broken.
---
I wanted the Halloween one for my explosive fixer.
---
My main is a 302 gauss shotgun user and has no real problems, my alt (101) rifle user now has to burn through x3 the ammo and stimpaks.
---
I had been using the alt to do the seasons as it levels faster but i had to revert to the main due to the OW changes.
---
Bottom line, the game became much less fun :(
---
Beth quickly needs to find a way to help non-meta players. I can totally understand people are finding this overwhelming, in my more meta builds I am  finding this a fun challenge but less so on my pistol build. Maybe now that Beth has shown they can tailor enemies to players they can let people stay on the world the way they are and give people the option to have an easier playthrouh too. Tailor the rewards based on difficulty too.
---
Once you get about level 170 it is just straight up not fun if you don't have some weapon mods
---
Yeah, they prominently featured a flooring pattern in a bundle I bought before and I did ask if I could get it anyway since the photos implied it's inclusion.
---
They said I could have it for a special deal of 500 atoms. I declined because it isn't that special but it was heavily featured which pissed me off. Literally, the flooring was the focal point of the photo and the actual items were more in the background.
---
I don't care all that much, and honestly, I tried to see if they'd give it to me anyway because I've heard of others having success in doing so.
---
Bloodied build  Nerfed by 50 %
---
enemies  buffed by 25%.
---
Quite a lot really.
---
we all knew Bloodied was going to be nerfed.
---
This though was like going to the Barbers for a bit of a trim,and him giving you a number 0.
---
Nobody asked for that.
---
People just wanted the game balanced a bit more.
---
For me this  has Ruined the game this patch .
---
Now even as level 400 player i am failing what were once simple events i could often complete solo.,Reason being now pretty much all enemies require 3,4,even 5 shots to kill.VATS is fundamentally broken because of  it.We all know you get off a couple of shots VATS [drains.It](https://drains.It) was still possible to drop an enemy on every VATS Bar refill..Now you are spending twice the amount time trying to kill  ghous/Bugs and reloading whilst Hordes are attacking multiple targets and overwhelming them.
---
Another high level player and me did Line in the Sand,Scorched attack including the new Scorched annihilator (Bullet Sponges).No way of just 2 of us keeping up now with the Scorched needing twice the damage to drop,and VATS no longer functioning properly because of the damage changes.We both end up just stood on the Sonic weapon platform using Melle weapons to kill them.Reason being they were getting there before our weapons could kill them.
---
Colossal problem i have been previously able to complete this with just 1 high level [player.Now](https://player.Now) it is just a waste of ammunition if there are too few players..Low level players join teams hide near the event and just hide and hope.I dont blame them really.I bet nobody a Bethesda thought about taking a few layers of Earl Armour to compensate for the fact we can only do half the damage.
---
I often play late night because of work commitments.Whats the point now ?,Events definitely need a few players to guarantee any T bonds.
---
I noticed today gamers were not even bothering with Events,Low levels might as well just log off if they are the only ones on the server.
---
That sounds boring
---
They screwed up the damage the rest of the update is fine. a few bugs like scoreboard leveling up infinitly till you dashboard and games crashing when you join a buddy on private server but other then that its fine. 
---
Good luck doing events.. its much harder almost not worth it.
---
I have a very similarly built character, running AAE lever action, TSE handmade, and AAE Gatling Plasma... if I didn’t carry that I’d use Demo Expert... here’s my build. 
---
Oh and just Vanguards SS set, other stats weren’t super important to me. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5c568c8&amp;d=sb2s01pd2pk2pl2pp2eh2eo1cd0ce0cm0cu2ic4s12a71s71an2ao0a50au2l71lu2lt2x03x90xm0xp0xq0pq0&amp;m=51c9f3&amp;am=16203b-1627-162230-162632-162538&amp;wp=w5w5w8&amp;wm=11283c-1k28-112838
---
How can Beth fuck up shotgun damage with a random armor mod? This game's source code must be a mess...
---
that would be fantastic for sneak builds in daily ops, maybe being able to do sneak damage. i would love that
---
I agree. I hope in time they will boost damage again somewhat. Brutal nerf. Wait for the next expansion perhaps?
---
Yeah it’s literally under the ‘rare reward’ slot lol
---
You lost them
---
It's the wastelanders content drought all over again
---
I got 2 camp plans on my charisma mule earlier, now that was a slap in the face. (my charisma mule is like 157)
---
But yes, I've gotten none as a rare reward on 3 other alts now.
---
The drop rates so don't match my experience so far, or my experience on the PTS.
---
yeah probably a combat or gauss for end game, whatever I can find for leveling
---
Especially if so
---
Just go to the nuclear waste disposal site and grind all mutations, it's fast and free
---
I fucked one yesterday a bit taking a wrong turn. It happens. Theres a bit of forgiveness in the timing though. As long as everyone gets there and holds the circle its still possible to get good times.
---
Its a game bro, its meant to be fun, not a job.
---
Oh this is awesome thank you
---
If I do get the plan I'll have to make a small building for it, my camp is also based on the seedy shed.
---
I won't lie if she was on the map I would probably kill her lol. You could do it in the other fallout games why not in this one?
---
I still don't understand, can you explain it again? Thanks in advance ;-)
---
It sort of does. You can use a partial core to craft 2+ ultracite cores (I think you can make as many as 5 with the Legendary perk, ammo Smith and Super Duper but haven't tested).
---
I try to eject my cores before they're empty and make U cores to feed my UGL. Power armor will run on them in a pinch and with high intelligence you can make them with 120% charge.
---
How does empath and herd mentaility work if you're in a solo group, they specifically target other team members, am I missing something?
---
I'm getting frozen and jammed so can't even stim, nothing works, may be a bug?
---
I'm clueless as to where and what that is. But that sounds much better.
---
Bethesda is trying to make the battle system more "serious" while everything else is a joke.
---
Yes, way more than before the update
---
As far as I can tell, that door isn't even in the game?
---
At least, I don't see it in the door menu with an atomic shop icon next to it.
---
It is very much the focus of the photo though.  Same as your floor.  Obviously with the intention to make it seem like the item that is being displayed.  Instead of some sconces that are shown in other photos as well.
---
or if you're like me and hit elder and don't even get a rare reward :(
---
Thanks everyone - going to give these options a try tonight
---
Pretty much the whole final season of content is cancelled patched in with rerun episodes.
---
They probably won't put it in because its gonna end up broken day1.
---
I ran an op this morning, after dailies rest with a friend who hadn't run it yesterday.  I myself had eldered it yesterday and we did the same today.
---
Fast forward a couple hours and to the new one today.  Did it, eldered it, got a rare plan.
---
Were you in the op when the ops reset by chance?
---
Thanks for the tips. I've taken to buggering off home now for breaks, then traveling back to either my tent or vault 76 to continue my adventures when I'm done. Next is sorting out inoculation quest and getting access to the raiders and settlers. I heard they're now free to fast travel to too.
---
No sir. No food perks whatsoever
---
I do but that is not his intent. He is clearly frustrated and directing it at people who don't know how to do the mission yet. People don't direct cuss words at people to teach them. Booty bothered, tushy tantrum. Fanny frustrated and or all the other variations.
---
I would love that!
---
It’s no problem, I usually have marsupial on hand as gifts for lower levels. If you need to keep refreshing it tho I’ll need the flux for it, I don’t farm nuke zones like I used to. Gt same as name
---
berkley springs station now.  walled in like a mofo too
---
Heard he’s been relocated at Berkeley spring train station or something
---
In my work, I'm not directly in sales, but a lot of what I do involves negotiating agreements between multiple parties.
---
When the moneys in hand - I always under promise, while over-delivering. The recipient always seems happier that way.
---
While trying to secure an agreement, often it's the reverse. When both competitors are over promising with the intention of under delivering, and your goal is to get the buy-in, it can sometimes be advantageous to over promise.
---
I think with Bethesda, the latter seems more advantageous than the former for likely a large number of factors.
---
Just do it again Tomorrow
---
So, why don't we have a server option for the 5% crowd? All of you guys are thrilled with One Wasteland. And, let's be clear - the issue is NOT the damage recalculation for us casuals/normies, it's One Wasteland. Literally none of my friends who play were asking for that update, and I certainly wasn't. I would prefer that Bethesda actually fix the myriad of bugs before they go adding content. Some of these bugs came over from Fallout 4, others go back even farther.
---
Can't we both have what we want in the same game?
---
I play Stealth/Vats/Junkies/Rifleman 
---
I use a Junkies, 25% Faster Fire Rate, 25% Less VATS AP cost lever action rifle.
---
Saw extreme debuffs, went from doing 1800-3200 dmg fully gassed up critical headshot at night, to 200 dmg per shot.
---
With some careful maneuvering I basically managed to get my LAR back up to a doing around d 1000 per critical headshot at night, with around 400-600 being the average headshot.
---
If you want I can share my build on Nukes Dragon
---
&gt; Players can now correctly acquire more than one Mutation in a given play session
---
This either doesn't work, or has some ridic long cooldown timer. Still better to server hop if you want to collect a bunch of mutations.
---
People are still figuring shit out. Mistakes and missteps happen. Dont beat yourself up and if you end up in a snarky team leave and join another. Im a bit directionally challenged so my biggest weakness is taking a wrong turn in these if I happen to not notice which way the others went. Stick with your team, stay in the circles and ignore enemies along the way and you are already doing the best you can and better than many. Once these have been run for a while they are going to go a lot smoother when people have had time to figure them out and learn the dungeons maps. Eveyone just needs to learn some patience in the meantime
---
They were concerned it couldn't be managed under Social Distancing.
---
2020 man. What a year.
---
The freezing is an issue, I went in with one friend also a melee, we punched everything between us and the objective then when in the objective we hid, no caution or hidden, so we just tried to position ourselves in such a way the Mutants had to get closer to the objective, punch them out when they get closer then hide again, then sprint to the next objective!
---
With two more more people it goes very quickly.
---
Personality I'm using serendipity, recochet, dodgy and blocker, all helping to mitigate damage and thus the freezing. 
---
Armor was secret service chest with jetpack, and unyielding heavy combat limbs with brawler on the arms and ultralight on the legs!
---
As for stimming, try to preemptively stim as you start taking damage so you're not being slowed too much to stop the heal.
---
Moved to the Berkeley Springs station.
---
Thx I started playing again this week last time I played was July 2019..thought I was going crazy lol
---
But they'll bring back the Halloween atom shop items.
---
Like firing ballistic Stim packs.
---
Not sure what the problem is.
---
Like i said my first shot hits an enemy his health drops to say 50%.
---
When i hit him with what i think will be the Kill shot,his health jumps up to about 75%.
---
The third shot drops his health to about 2%
---
The 4th one kills him.
---
Even happens when i shoot up the Cars at Whitespring. :-(
---
I seem to have gotten lucky these past 2 days. Yesterday I got the Super Reactor plan, and today I got the caged lights and BoS Spec Ops Suit
---
Get out.
---
We need an end game sniper rifle. My fucking lever rifle does more damage than my sniper rifle.  Please todd give me the anti material rifle
---
For gauss rifles, it’s basically just grabbing the sneak perks and going for relatively close range snipes.
---
Here’s some advice for the gauss pistol based on my pistol build - criticals are wonderful. With a proper set-up, you can dish out a crit every 2-5 shots, which deals some insane damage.
---
Any reason why? 
---
Because it seems to have upset more than its pleased and Bethesda themselves have admitted on here through various posts that they are looking into it
---
Objectively it has the potential to push more players away and put the longevity of the game in an even worse state
---
What is it about this update that you think its worth keeping around at the risk of damaging the very game?
---
Not contesting just asking
---
SWTOR is one of my favorite games of all time. It had some of the best story lines and campaigns eve ever played and had a lot of replayability. But yeah it was way more friendly for solo players, though I had thought FO76 was surprisingly so for the three days I played it before this patch. I was really loving it. Maybe they'll rework some things. I can hope. My issue is I don't like playing with strangers, and I have a hard time getting any of my friends into anything for very long.
---
I am complaining because my Gun is not working correctly.
---
Sorry this offends you.
---
Yeah I’ve done it loads and been ok so far touch wood but it’s been known to happen
---
That could totally be possible.
---
what is crazy about this too is the real end of the stick here is the lower level/new players who don't have access or know about how to obtain legendary weapons and armor to alleviate fights
---
Before this update new players had issues with ammo/caps/repairs/getting killed too frequently by high level players boosting the enemies in the area ( didn't happen a lot, but it did happen )
---
And what are their problems now .. ammo/caps/repairs/getting killed too frequently but now even more frequently because they can't escape bullet sponges any longer and everything they run into now is scaled up
---
This also hurt the pve gamers who just mill about and do their own thing, build a bit, scavenge a bit, talk to friends .. not particularly looking to be competitive or in need of a challenge but now are forced to alter their playstyle to at least partially to how other gamers played .. now instead of utility perks, they need damage/defense perks .. now instead of building or talking with friends they need to go out and farm ammo or research meta perks they now need
---
I think rather than this update alleviating an issue for a small group of players they made new problems for several groups of players instead
---
Meanwhile, nobody shows up on my servers
---
It’s so weird right? Like they give you a taste of a feature that could be outstanding, and there’s a clear path for them to make it outstanding but they haven’t acted on it.
---
I got the same plan. Was wondering something. It takes 2 modules to craft, so maybe the nocturnal effect is not the third star. Maybe it will be a Anti-Armor WITD? Kind of like how The Fixer has a de facto 4th star. 
---
Has anyone crafted it from the Plan recently? Can you confirm that I’m crazy?
---
I'd like to be able to snap upper floors to foundations.
---
And then there's my nemesis:
---
**"Cannot remove item: Part of the structure would not be accessible."**
---
Let me move my stairs.
---
I managed to do a daily ops yesterday alone, and I figured out that if I found just the right spot,  my stealth armor kept me hidden, and I could successfully hide by the signal booster and run out the clock. Being alone, that took FORFUCKINGEVER.
---
So it can be done, alone, using stealth, but its not recommended.
---
It'll work on backwards compatability but Bethesda probably won't bother upgrading it to run natively!
---
Lol git gud we need some competition out here, I think you’re looking for fallout 4
---
I've been here since beta, I can only assume you have as well. I was never interested in analyzing my perk cards because the game did not work that way from day 1. Yes, you could play it that way, but you could also make your own path. I guess I missed the tutorial that said I had to optimize to play the game as designed.
---
I agree but it’s a sales tactic to get you to look in there regularly
---
&gt; in previous Fallout games you didn't have to do this, and could experience the entire game by speech checks and alternative solutions.
---
I've never played Fallout one and two. I know for a fact that with Fallout 3 onward, combat was always part of it no matter what. There was no way that you could completely combat it in all situations.  You had to build around a certain weapon type to make your build strong enough to survive combat. And if you didn't, then you got wrecked.
---
As someone who missed it the first time around, I can't help but feel a little disappointed. Guess I'll have to wait another year for my Vault reaper cutout
---
I'm doing a lot more nukes but I've noticed whenever I'm not actively doing them very few others are. It's probably because I've only started launching them recently so I want to launch them whereas everyone else is trying the new stuff and not wanting to spend huge ammo on stuff they've probably already got all the good rewards from
---
game was too easy. way too easy. and even easier for bloodied build.
---
Yeah it’s definitely a speed thing, altho I’ve got a vampires ripper and it’s very fast but I’m not finding it effective enough so I need to look at it and see what I’m doing wrong. It feels like it should be doing much better
---
Me too!
---
Well that's a let down. Mischief night was a hoot
---
I get it. It look me 40m, being alone, lvl 75 with a stealth build. Just waiting for the signal boosters was probably 30m of that time.
---
That's hardly an exploit considering how much they nerfed melee! It'd be a fair workaround to temporarily give us some damage.
---
Lmao no ones guns working correctly they clearly messed up the nerf because they just changed how they calculated dmg and shipped it didn’t even change much and what they changed before release is still broke obviously your guns gonna do less dmg but it’s “not working correctly” it’s the game bug that’s been here for along time the rubber banding health is a long time problem and if you wanna complain about things don’t get wah wah baby mode when people come a talk about it with a different opinion
---
Just about slammed my finger through the keyboard upvoting it
---
Ah well. Good luck out there in the wasteland. I'm sure your stubbornness is welcomed.
---
I am level 315 and have almost 1k hours on and man, it is a fucking nightmare rn. Just give crits more damage and would incentivize combat as higher level enmies just do way more than the max lvl 68's we usually fought. It just sucks rn and is more frustrating than it is fun.
---
It’s not hard. Because they put a marker on it and say what to do.
---
Cause the game is still a joke. Soloed Earl with no problem tonight. Also soloed daily ops and got me that elder rank
---
Can’t find the pool table under table, unless I keep missing it.
---
because bethesda are a bit silly. 
---
i don't think they're gonna change it. inspirational worked in a team by yourself but that got fixed.
---
Oh definitely. After months of resistance out of principle I've finally succumb to the alluring call of stealth crit commando and this is exactly how I play. Makes my furious/33/rw assault rifles absolutely chew through enemies. And Four Leaf Clover is a godsend.
---
Ouch. I got 3 old man winter power armor helmets and I never use power armor, so I can relate.
---
NW reflects PvE perk distribution so legendary ones should apply. I know many would say unfair unfair but actually why tie NW perks to PvE at all? NW should have its own perk distribution customized for PVP, not copied over from PVE then disallow legendary perks. Current settings doesn’t make sense at all.
---
So the majority should be hampered because your build is still op..?
---
On Xbox here, haven’t noticed anything of the sort. Might be lucky though lol
---
Especially if they’re at a good travel spot you need to get nearby. I usually visit camps with tons of plans in hopes of completing my mounted head collection.
---
Oh I had three turrets and the liberators either shot them or danced around them. They certainly destroyed my resource machines while killing me.
---
How disappointing. So we're already getting 3 treasure hunters over the next couple months, another meat week. What are they going to do, bring back fasnacht with the same crap?
---
It’s a game respec and that unfortunately in your case means a charachter respec or at the least a change in how you play , I’m a bloodied commando and I have to be a bit more tactical now like when escorting the messanger not earlier, moving from high vantage point to point keeping him covered, before I would just crouch along beside him, which personally I like the change up
---
Daily Ops needs a Hunter/Hunted option where one player can initiate the event and other players have time to join in.
---
I have quite the opposite problem. Lots of repair kits not enough notes. But i do play on three different builds. Thats a lotta mouths to feed so I'll take all the notes and scrip I can get.
---
I got u I’ll dm u
---
Agreed.  I suspect there will be some tweaking over the next few updates.   I am out of town, can't wait until Sat night to put my chars through some paces.   Especially my low level.
---
So if you don't get it for getting elder rank, you have to try again the next day?
---
I don't consider you entitled, just terrible at adapting.
---
Having said that though, I do feel that some tuning is required so it's not constant 100% pressure all of the time. Maybe tune down the Forest area a little so that weaker builds can either farm there to catch up or just live permanently in that region because that level of difficulty is more their speed.
---
Either that or scale based on deaths, so if you're constantly dying a lot, the difficulty gets tuned down for a while. However, along with the difficulty being tuned down, your rewards likewise get tuned down too, as it's only fair that if you can't compete at a high level, that you shouldn't also get the rewards of that high level as well.
---
You're already too toxic
---
I’m on pc, game was running great the last few days and then today it’s bad. Even the main menu was giving me a hard time.
---
Aww man. I liked watching my frame rate drop down into single digits when everything exploded at once.
---
Recently got herbivore, cranberry relish gives me +20% xp, lovers embrace +5% combine all this with the insane new xp off enemies and I'm absolutely loving this new update. In flying through levels, it's fantastic
---
Gone through 70+ Stim packs the last 2 days,insane.
---
I couldn't do the daily OP even if i wanted to.
---
Just didn't have the Stim Packs for it.
---
I think i used 60 first time around,have not done it since.
---
Think i fucked up trying to take out every Gutsy,and ended up with more holes in me than a Tea Strainer.
---
Going to take the advice from Reddit users next time and just try and run through it.
---
Maybe i will only use 59 Stim Packs :-)
---
My main issue was the tone of the original post. 
---
It's like if I handed you a burger on a gourmet brioche bun, fresh lettuce and tomato, the best beef money can buy, and then a nice thick layer of dog shit. And then I said to you "oh? You asked for a burger, you got a gourmet burger with fresh ingredients? I guess that isn't what you wanted?" 
---
The issue is the dog shit, not the rest of the burger. OP goes after "complainers" and then lists everything but their one main complaint. That was my issue.
---
As for the difficulty. I haven't tried it yet but I was already annoyed with how hard the game can be at times. I think I won't like it.
---
Do you have blocker equipped, would that help?
---
The question should be; should the game remain as a joke cause you run a poorly optimized build?
---
The nerf and level scaling has made the early game soo much harder.... Put in a support ticket because Bethesda really needs to hear this first hand!
---
Oh and I keep waiting for the wolf pack event (3 guaranteed legendaries) ... and it’s never spawning.
---
My team was running vault 94 all morning as soon as we finished we jumped straight back in. It’s good just for the legends. Managed to get a bloodied home made and a bloodied explosive mini gun so I’m pretty happy with that. Got a few pipes and wrenches to tho lol
---
Oh trust me, I look there regularly, but I’m just not interested enough in some of the things they put out. Like the Mothman stuff. They’re cool, but I’m not DYING to buy them. I’ve been saving up enough Atoms in order to buy the nice Contemporary bundle, and I might buy the Atom starter pack so I can get one of the Mothman bundles, but that’s about it. I want more variety, more wallpapers, more stuff for my house that I don’t have to worry will vanish into the Vault for god knows how long.
---
A major component of this  game is to secure and eventually launch nukes. To run a missile silo you have to have a build that is dedicated to a certain weapon type. It's not about grinding end game content. It's about completing the game in the way that it was intended to be completed.
---
I just googled it. Unfortunately I already have 3 that I want and am looking for a few more specific ones to get. And from what I've read you cant get rid of the one you dont want without risking losing the ones I wanna keep. So I'm stuck trying to buy serums still.
---
I can’t even understand this post.
---
It's an online multiplayer. So no. Just tweak your perk cards like everyone else and quit so selfish. If you can't handle the challenge then go play something else.
---
I'm so conflicted on Appalachia radio. I don't hate julia, but her voice lines get so repetitive to the point of exhaustion, but I think the song selection is by far the greatest of any fallout game. I love every single song, but having her say "I'm only 23" between every other song makes me want to leap off grafton dam
---
edit : spelling
---
Doesn't for me either
---
 This really makes me want to run it more, but I basically blow through all my ammo doing it once.
---
Stealth is completely broken this patch so hard to take it into account.
---
Yeah man I got 2 of those as well
---
I rate the update however feel it's not entirely finished. I hope they add to it and revise accordingly.
---
I can't help but feel we've left some people in the dark. My toon is well built and I struggle in areas. I play with family who don't understand builds and I know aren't going to be able to survive. O_o 
---
The Follow Through perk I'm not really feeling either. It should be multiplicative to be 'legendary'. It's addition basis I'm not actually *feeling* in my shots and it's like it's not even there despite allegedly being +40%. I almost regret taking it.
---
Thanks for letting me know. Now I don't have to waist my time trying again.
---
Can you rephrase that in the form of a productive sentence. Jeopardy fo76 edition does not take incomprehensible rage posts.
---
Where’s the purveyor?
---
This is the way.
---
Seriously I wish people could trade the plans, in the last two spec ops I've done the elder part under the 8min and had no special reward...think the game hates me lol
---
I had the same thing, if the marker is just on the compass and doesn't give you the description , e.g. 'signal repeater' it is bugged.  I had to restart the game and then it worked.
---
rusty pick in ash heap.
---
If they keep doing this it kills the game i love trading intresting weapons but wastelanders was bad becouse we couldnt trade and now i cant trade that weapon eather and some people say "dupers will trade it" but most dupers have scripts and tools to transfer items like that anyways so there only blocking legit players from getting the drops they wanted when it comes to legendary drops if we could pick the first star then i would be fine with it not being trade able.
---
Sure.  You can get more legendaries though
---
The spread and damage/distance should be adjusted for sure. Oh and hackers should be nerfed on pc 😂
---
Are you saying that if I run it I shouldn't try to beat 8 minutes every time?
---
Are you on a team with someone sharing Aquaboy/girl?
---
Thx bruh
---
I mean, I gave up playing the game because they nerf everything and never rebalance it out
---
Thats not how a game of this type, especially Fallout, should be balanced.
---
But hey, if you still one shot power to you
---
Just want to say, this is the definition of gatekeeping and you can turn right around with that “make adjustments” attitude. The Wasteland (parts of it, anyway) was easy for me before this update and I loved that it was; I feel like I EARNED that by reaching my high level. I don’t want to worry about having an optimized build, or perfectly modded weapons. I absolutely should not have to play the way you do in order to find this game enjoyable or manageable. So that’s that.
---
The earl fight is interesting for me considering my damage vs earl was decreased around 33% with my bloody .50cal but my damage vs the wendigo spawns was almost halved from 350 per bullet per headshot at max adrenaline to 200 still killed him in under 20 mins with a mate and 2 people that weren't doing much and only killed a few wendigos
---
It isn't even a hard fight and never was
---
HAHA epic!!!!! these damn casuals right, how dare they not spend their every waking second into the perfect build that does the ultimate damage hahah wow casuals amirite guise
---
Ooh, where'd you find that out?
---
The Queen and Earle I now do 20 damage or less on melee, this is a min maxed build with armor peircing, I still get at least 200 damage on mook enemies which die in 2 - 6 swings.
---
I looked this time...20 556 is what I got
---
Wut
---
Literally what I was gonna do, but couldn’t drop the plans. Now find out I can’t even drop the weapon? Like why...
---
Odd, sorry they weren't doing their jobs and protecting your butt. I've had luck just spamming them on the ground around me once the wave starts, and then running around keeping aggro with a melee weapon lol. Also have a little blueprint with the defense structure with the combined stairs and platform, with two turrets up on it. I lay a few of those down real quick and the increased elevation works wonders.
---
Nope just normal ones.
---
Because it makes it a better game
---
Does it though? Right now as a company they're the laughing stock of the industry.
---
Bugginess was their trademark from way back. However, nowadays it's a lack of competence, a chronic inability to stick a deadline and, aside from a few exceptions like Wastelanders, under delivering.
---
No sane company would want incompetence, tardiness and under performing as the hallmarks of their brand.
---
They were going to introduce a quest with the Brotherhood as an introduction this fall, but apparently they pushed the whole thing back to winter when the full Fractured Steel expansion releases
---
Well that's just silly then.
---
Same here, my first rare reward. Who gets it? My junkie fucking commando... sigh.
---
How do you defeat something with no life?
---
Sounds like you would benefit from my build. I'll post it later.
---
Oh boi, you really missed the joke huh
---
The post is sarcastic
---
The whole respec is a bit far imo, nerfing everythimg 60%, is a bit much, i can understand 30% thats fine, but 60%, seems a bit much. My toon as a bloodied heavy pa build, i should be able to withstand a lvl 50 tic and not have to use 10+ rounds on it. I feel as if some revision is needed on bethesda and zenimaxs part.
---
Have no idea what kept you playing after that TSE nerf back in 2019. It was much more drastic and somehow you didn't quit
---
That stealth damage legendary perk is 100% useless since sneak attacks don't even proc this patch on anything with any weapon!
---
The only one you can't trade is the glave. What the fetch fetch a pretty penny
---
I've already had three just in 10 minutes of playing so no seems to be normal
---
I missed the vending machine secret door then built an awesome camp with a speakeasy drinking den under the upstairs family diner and soooo want it to complete it, so they got me - check it every day now incase it’s back on a 1 day sale but yeah the shops very thin on stock
---
I have to 2nd this suggestion. I have around 1200 hours invested spread over 3 characters, my highest lvl is 174. It's a Bloodied build. Quite frankly, I'm finding it too hard to play now. Lvl 100 tank-like enemies 1 shotting me is just not a fair fight. I'm having to stealth my way through everything without touching enemies &amp; so I'm missing out on XP. 
---
I don't mind nerfs here &amp; there but this one has broken me.
---
I need to reconsider my build now but I need perks to do that. 1 free complete respec would help immensly so yeah, OP gets a big upvote from me.
---
Bounce through the forest down from abbies bunker. I ran into a legendary bloatfly,honey beast and gulper in around 20 mins.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
I've been looking for the Harpers ferry vendor for well over a year &amp; still hadn't found it.... I'm actually glad to hear that it's moved to a better location!
---
I assume by lame shit you mean this post
---
Use a mr handy buzzblade and move them far away
---
honestly the most important part of it is just knowing where you're going, and knowing to just avoid enemies until you're at the two nodes. Once we've burned through the 3-4 locations you'll know where the nodes will be / lay of the land, and get used to the mutations and how to engage those types.
---
also having a jetpack will help with verticality, and sprint / speed / AP boosting perks. 
---
Unless the Alpha and Bravo sites get randomized...but either way within a couple of week's we'll all be bored by Daily Ops because we've seen all the permutations and can beat them all in like 6 min, regardless of level.
---
I can understand why it isn't happening, quite a few people had game crashes due to all the exploding cars etc...
---
Personally I never encountered it once on ps4 and I did it countless times. It did get a tad bit laggy tho.
---
It's a shame really, I really enjoyed that event but hopefully whatever they replace it with will be ok too
---
Being honest here, I am shit at builds in games. I just slap shit together that sounds good and go from there, I haven’t had this issue others are having where you no longer really do any damage. I still deal with having high level enemies all around me because som try hard level 400 walked by and that’s all that spawned. Maybe I’m used to stuggling but, unless it’s a boss, I’m not having a hard time killing it. What am I missing?
---
Bombs Drop
---
Hate that change. Harpers ferry was the best cap grind location. One run through would net me 1000-1200 caps in weapons and armor. Then just waddle 100 feet and sell it all. Wallace is no longer within waddle distance.
---
Similar issue. Been playing with my wife for a few months now. Today, a radroach killed her and she, for lack of a better term, ragequit, and said she wanted to stop playing altogether. Broke my heart a bit.
---
BOO! Honestly Val this game is focused on Halloween, you have several locations dedicated to Halloween, there is a Pumpkin House, Freddy Fears House of Scares, a Watchtower decked out in Halloween stuff and the same at the highschool, there absolutely needs to be a Halloween event of some sort.
---
Give us an event where we nuke Pumpkin House slap on some decorations and ghouls in costumes throw in some lunch boxes and fireworks have double xp for the weekend and call it a day.
---
ahm... you mean legal stuff, i guess?
---
I just went dedicated melee and was on mop up duty while everybody else brought health down.
---
Rip Possum badges
---
I tried going to New world's and restarting app...just gave up until tomorrow. Had to go to work without my true fallout fix...
---
Or shelter?
---
If you want challenging, go all in with a sniper or melee food build.
---
I did Wards quest yesterday for the Osmosis Kit.
---
Took me to Watoga,where i watched the thief beating an Assaultron to death.Very impressive
---
I didn't even give him time to enjoy the moment.I shot him in the Head straight after,And took the Kit back to Ward.
---
What platform?
---
So I run a junkies heavy pa tank build.  I certainly consume more ammo, but I dont feel substantially weaker than before.  It used to be 2 taps to kill an enemy. First got em close and the second got em dead.  Now the first takes a large percentage and the second kills.
---
The new enemies certainly hit harder.  In the case of yao guai, a LOT harder.  But I still dont heal much, in fact, I dont need to heal at all anymore.
---
In all, yes.  I lost about 20 percent of my damage, average across all 14 weapons I use regularly.  But I still feel powerful, and I'm more resistant than ever thanks to some of the new legendary perks.  
---
On the new perks, they are hit or miss.  Depending on build, they are either game changing, or useless.  In my case, I'm having a ball.
---
stealth commando, but if I get out of stealth for an inkling I'm hit, and in daily ops is not an option. I think the daily ops are what's breaking my armor fast, even with the 50% reduction.
---
That's would be 100% impossible as even without their instant detection mutation, stealth hits haven't worked at all this patch, it's broken!
---
Thinking about it, is there really a fix for the issues from last year? The disconnects and server flakiness was likely from all the exploding cars in Whitespring
---
I don't have a problem because I'm level 80, have access to plenty of damage perks, and good weapons and armor. And when I say I don't have a problem, I mean I have the resources to make and collect enough ammo to deal with it. With a different gun and different perks, I would not be surprised if I was getting frustrated also. 
---
One of my brothers sits right next to me playing on his Xbox, and I can literally watch him struggle if we are not playing together, when before the patch he was having no where near the trouble he is having now. Thankfully, we can play together often. And I can hook him up with stims and ammo, but he would be having trouble if I didn't help. 
---
But I'm glad you just assumed I was complaining for no reason and you chose only that one part of what I said to respond to.
---
Look man, obviously you have poor reading comprehension or maybe you are just contrary, and that's fine. The point is that challenge is good, but the way it is right now is not good. Yes, there is more challenge, but not in a good way. Every enemy being a bullet sponge is not fun. A boss or legendary, of course you should have to put quite a few rounds into them. And you should also need to use tactics and buffs to do it, but just stand there and unload till it dies.  But not every enemy, that's just annoying and not fun.  Is cool that you like how it is now, but to say nothing is wrong is just being blind to the problems. And being ok with many people being frustrated for a legitimate reason is not cool. 
---
I don't see why anyone has to argue about this. Obviously before it was not good and everything was too easy. But the way it is now is not the way. There is a way to do it where everyone can be happy, noobs and vets. Min maxers and get gud scrubs. My hope is this is just temporary and Bethesda will keep working on it and quickly it can be good for everyone, but anyone who just says "cry more and get gud" is being an asshole about this. Every play style should be valid even if every play style is not good at curb stomping enemies. And obviously many people had great fun just slaughtering enemies before with a bloodied build or one of the other high damage builds, so there is room for that in the game still. It just shouldn't be every enemy in the game that can be slapped around like that.
---
They gonna wait until enough people get ps5 and not some decade old console
---
Makes me sad, I got cage lights lol.
---
Damn people really don't like sarcastic responses huh
---
Didn't you hear? Halloween is cancelled
---
Very empty too on PS4, it's killed a lot of the community and a lot of low level players are just giving up!
---
Never used it but I know a lot of people left because of it
---
Just seems obscene to keep nerfing everything into the ground
---
thank you i was realy confused with all of this
---
People say "its becouse of dupers" that they do this with weapons but there are alot of dupers and RMT traders that have tools made every update to allow trading of these items so the only person who misses out on trading these items are people wanting to trade legit for other items or caps.
---
Pc
---
How so?
---
Does that mean I can't obtain the ammo converter?
---
Yeah, crits and stealth are extremely good, but doing both would really lock you into being a dps build only from what I’ve seen.
---
Since you play as a commando - don’t use whistle in the dark. If you were around in survival mode, it’s the same weapon from those challenges, only it can be crafted with a unique paint scheme (which is red and yellow, of all things). Bonus perception and hit chance and are nice, but the primary is nocturnal.
---
It's pretty ridiculous. I was actually down voted in a previous thread for saying that you have to pick a weapon and dedicated your build to it.  I mean.... seriously? One of this game's central concerns is to secure a nuke silo and launch a nuke. To do that you need to have a build that can handle it. I don't even consider myself to be a meta build or a min maxer and I do just fine. The people complaining must have god awful builds.
---
Not just tat. U need drinks regularly
---
As someone who is level 25 with perks almost entirely dedicated to getting rid of the *Survival Game* elements, I agree completely, I was having fun a week ago, now I am not. I've had three armor breaks and four weapon breaks just today, and two of those weapon breaks were the same weapon from full health... I am actually doing better as far as mats, ammo, and healing than ever before. But that is because I am now tryharding, this is not the kind of game I want to be tryharding in, and frankly I definitely don't think it's the kind of game that will keep my interest if I am.
---
I got the 94 stash the 94 jumpsuit, my son for the warglaive and the super generator (whatever it is called) so I am doing better than those not seeing plans but sad since I am getting the shit ones.
---
Press Square, load without a team.
---
Didn’t miss a thing
---
Would be nice if completing on Elder would guarantee a 3 star.
---
Different people want different things. There were always going to be people that wanted the game to be what they played and enjoyed for 2 years.
---
You get three chances at the rewards
---
Completed Elder on my first shot today, didn't get any plans, not even uncommon ones.
---
I only start the groups and not join if I’m waiting on my friends to load into the game or get ready for the op. Other than that I’m doing the op or not in an op team.
---
Is there door written below? That's what counts.
---
You could also launch a nuke, if you want, ya know?
---
Doesn't seem to bother EA.
---
The write up made me laugh, lol. Nothing I didn’t already know, but funny, so an updoot for you.
---
And 1 ad that pops up after every game. It's really good.
---
Asbestos chest mod knocks that shit down to 0. Fire in colossal is just a visual now.
---
Ah, gotcha
---
Wondering the same thing
---
It's not like you're giving yourself a hacked weapon or anything.  It's perk loadouts...the thing you say you want.
---
This is a solved problem if you're on PC.
---
The SeventySix.esm of course.
---
Well.. since you pressed me on it ... It didn't take me 2 minutes to find:
---
[Fallout 3 Pacifist](https://youtu.be/pN9zlZS8GbI)
---
[Fallout NV Pacifist](https://youtu.be/0uEyMJFXdiU)
---
[Fallout 4 Pacifist](https://youtu.be/Vc6S04ib3r4)
---
Well done.
---
Edit: since some might have trouble understanding context apparently, these links are each part in a completed series on their channels.
---
I don’t really see how it could possibly go faster with weaker weapons and stronger enemies unless there’s significantly fewer enemies.
---
The lack of punctuation bothers me. Hard to tell where some shit ends and other shit starts.
---
I ran it this morning and it was the burning mine robots and melee to kill... then immediately switched to the valley galleria and super mutants
---
I got 2 burrows signs , The Gutter and Small Solar Panel plans Fml all I want is the symptom matic and special ops outfit
---
No, not a dupe. My concern was it replacing a potential reward.
---
Man such a toxic community for down voting a serious problem like this, this is the worst nerf the game has ever seen, early game melee is impossible now!
---
I guess this will make all the Halloween plans I hoarded more valuable??
---
Could be neat if they go ESO style and start adding new states as zones.
---
This video from Angry Turtle gave me an idea what to do before I went in for the first time and some tips as well. It just goes over one version of the daily ops with one variant of enemy type, but I still helped me not be completely confused the first time.
---
[https://youtu.be/zaTj9OdaVAg](https://youtu.be/zaTj9OdaVAg)
---
It has started back over 4 times now. 1-14 over and over
---
hey it aint no formal essay, but here ya go if it does help. just mad at the game n community lol my bad.
---
"Furniture Set" could easily include a door.
---
&gt; terrible at adapting.
---
Why? Why should I adapt for the PVE game? Why I should play not the way I want to play? Games should be fun. What happens right now, is just not that fun for us.
---
I dont work in the gaming industry but I can tell you this: users who are upset with your product will always use words like "laughing stock" and will suggest all sorts of things about your company's reputations.
---
Your marketing teams meanwhile will say the surveys and focus groups indicate another direction.
---
Your investors will say something else based on their notions and beliefs.
---
And yet, your gut, if you are the decision maker, will say something else.
---
I dont know how tight a ship Bethesda runs, the state of their morale, or even their priorities. Nor does anyone who believes their suggestions will "improve" the game. 
---
I'm just trying to suggest they, or certain factions within Bethesda at least, may see some advantage in overpromising, if that is in fact what they are doing.
---
Yepp Crater and Foundation are free travel points, not 100% if you need to start wastelanders or just need the location explored to FT there.
---
Also dont sleep on public teams, the buffs are nice, perk sharing is awesome, and team mates + their camps and tents if they have them are all free fast travel points, plus free exp and caps when they complete quests. A mic is not nessecary imo.
---
Idk if the bug is still there for the part of the innoculation quest where you put the fuze in and test the blood. But the solution was to server hop til you find a public were it hasnt  been done yet or on a private server b/c they are created each time.
---
Good luck out there duder!
---
How many times do they have to release a fix for this until it actually works?
---
Spec ops outfit is really sweet
---
People that are suffering are the ones with extremely bad builds that focus on QOL. That's how I was back in early 2019. Didn't need to invest on a single damage perk cause if you got a tse, one tab and enemy dies. Then came the nerf and I had to respec. Well not respec but I started a new character. That's how it should be. You get some, you lose some. You got yourself some QOL, you are bound to suck at combat. Don't feel robbed. Improve and adapt. Also you can always choose to stay in your camp if you don't feel like fighting anything
---
Yup patch 21 broke tesla rifles!
---
&gt; This change was best for non meta players
---
Absolute bullshit, sorry.
---
Weird, I play the same build but haven't had to repair mine yet and I don't even have the perks that make them break slower
---
Either out of action points or it's just a bug, the bar down the bottom right determines how.many times you can swing/shoot in vats, rank up agility and it will allow you to do more, the action boy perk I recommended will really boost the rate that it recovers for you too, especially maxed out. Until then grab all the Nuka cola you can and favorite it as that replenishes AP also. Glad to hear your enjoying it : )
---
Yup, I missed Collosal Problem because it wouldn't let me fast travel in!
---
Got it. Be an edge-lord or quit. Got it. Well, casual folks, you heard the man, uninstall and quit. We've been playing wrong for almost 3 years. Uninstalling now. Thanks for setting me straight.
---
Shoot on sight, as far as I am concerned.
---
I rarely post about FO because I always liked it.. bugs and all.  Been playing since release date and have sunk way too much cash into atoms.
---
Saw this post and hadn't played the patch yet.  I usually play casual - I live in Flatwoods, am at a decent level (147), and I just play to chill.  If I want to do some leveling, head to the south of the map.. want to just pick up shit to sell, head to the top of the map.   But now.  Holy hell.  Level 50 mole rats outside of my camp. THEY'RE FUCKING MOLE RATS.  They should not take a third of my health.  I shouldn't have to sink a ton of 5.56mm into them.
---
There has never been one wasteland.. ever.   As a huge FO fan, you always have different areas depending on your level so you knew where to chill, where to find the action.  Hell, I've been playing since the original Wasteland and it was set up this way.  But now?  I'm not sure how I feel about this.  I know it sounds like a veiled threat, but I'm going to cancel my FO1 subscription because I just don't see me playing this like I used to.   Yeah some of this may have been too easy before but maybe find something in the middle instead of going all the way to the extreme?
---
Yeah I know.. bye Felica....
---
That's true.
---
Yeah thats fair
---
Actual translation is "radiation brawl" in case you were curious. My high school german finally paid off!
---
I want to know if Grenadier effects my explosive rifle.
---
Lies!!!
---
This was the problem for me. Thanks.
---
Weird indeed. I feel like everyone in the game has been hit with some sort of course, people are having problems with different things. I honestly think I do even more damage now then I did pre-One Wasteland.
---
My go to weapon right now for Mole Miners/Ghouls is a Bloodied black powder Rifle.
---
Just have to make sure i wont be swarmed by a horde because of the reload time.
---
Have won 3 PvP fights in the last 2 days with a bloodied Mingun.This was once useless in PvP not sure what has changed.
---
I got turned over by a Husband and wife Griefer team at Whitespring Station.When i look back it was actually quite funny,Hubby starts hitting me.I kill him,the missus then insta kills me,didnt even see her,nasty  lady.
---
So i respawn for revenge,kill the wife,and the husband then sucker punch kills me. Didnt see him either.
---
If you are on here reading this,you two are horrible. :-)
---
I Just give up.
---
I hate that mechanic where a team member not initiated by you for PvP can kill you.Wish Bethesda would fix it.
---
I like yesterday’s exploding blood eagles better. That one was actually fun.
---
Tired of sniper builds. 5 of 6 of my New Vegas runs were that. 
---
And I'm currently running a Berserkers 1h melee on one of my pc characters. And my main ps4 character can be 1h/2h/unarmed/heavy gunner all efficiently. Commando is the only playstyle I have never ran.
---
If you actually unlocked them, but you didn’t claim them, then plain and simple you lost them. You had plenty of time to claim them, and if you forgot, or you were away for whatever reason, that’s unfortunate. There’s no way for you to get them. You basically missed out on currency. 
---
HOWEVER if there were any camp items you wanted, I believe you can purchase them with gold now. I’m not sure I haven’t checked myself.
---
Ah, I was never a fan of survival mode. Went in with pve builds like an idiot and paid the price in stims. Lol Who wouldn't guessed that a heavy gunner tank with an explosive mini and PA would be one shotted by some invisible goob with no health and pre patch assassin armor?
---
We would hang back from the pack and stick to rooftops. Few crashes but framerate was awful.
---
*Math just works*
---
Classic Bethesda, can't hold a release date on fo76 to SAVE THIER LIVES.  Thanks Todd.
---
Good. Glad that's settled.
---
How would this work exactly? Don’t berserkers and junkies only work if you are using a berserkers or junkies weapon? If that’s the case how would a hybrid work if you can only equip one weapon at a time?
---
Just tried it in today's Daily Op. Glorious. 
---
And I left with more spikes and stimpaks than I started with.
---
Gotta start somewhere, I’m sure that time will just get better from here on in. Especially cause you’ve learnt from it, you know what to expect and can prepare ahead of time.

Alien Blaster has been buffed. Gauss Pistol is ripping shiet apart.
---
Dunno about any other pistols though.
---
Another sub on that.
---
what's your build btw
---
Or they could do away with the current idiotic system entirely and give us a proper respec like they've talked about for as long as I can remember.
---
Power armor isn't an endgame item, neither is a sniper rifle unless it's legendary...
---
no, I actually despise PVP, especially when not interested in doing so. I misread your comment, that's on me. I changed my downvote to an upvote btw ...
---
Oh
---
It's not meant to be tradeable.
---
I run a bloodied stealth commando built normally, but for Daily Ops, I swap out all stealth and low health perks and put on other perks, boost my health all the way back up and jump in my power armor. If I need extra help staying alive, I go in with a Vampire ranged weapon. It's totally doable. It just makes me sad I can't hide in there, lol
---
Fresh new character, no legendary perks, no bonuses at all just what you would have had access to if you were fresh.
---
Because my lv 22 had an easier time killing lv 68 enemies than he does level scaled matching ones!
---
And I'm hearing loads of reports on new players running out of ammo and scrap to repair their armor and weapons.
---
Also don't drink nuka shine
---
Can people stop spreading unsubstantiated rumors?
---
If you use the crippling perk you can take down a 3 star sheepsquatch no problem.i literally just did this in mire.took out the legs he dropped still with alot of hp.i just walked around him in a circle dumping shots into him.he mutated got up and i repeated the process.so glorifying standing over a huge enemy monster and he cannot do a damn thing to me..lolthe crippling perk comes in real handy with alot of enemies.
---
Yeah, probably
---
*If you are having trouble I will remind you that this is a multiplayer game. Make a team, grab a mic, and go take on the wasteland together.*
---
Multiplayer game where you can't even communicate with your team if you don't have a mic or the ability to even use one. They refuse to give people tools to make this an actual multiplayer game. Not everyone in the world has the ability to use mics even if they wanted to. Just more laziness on adding to the framework of a proper multiplayer game while shilling and pushing endless Atom Store updates and shallow quest lines.
---
And the lowest level power armor you can use is raider power armor at 15. You probably just found a frame, which are all over the place.
---
That type of reasoning is what got us to this point
---
Idk how you are one shorting bloatflies and radroaches. I can’t one shot a bloatfly with a shotgun and maxed shotgun perk cards.
---
I got like 500 5mm pretty consistently, maybe its my luck
---
/thread
---
My post raising my concerns literally just got replies saying get good that's not my concern I'm actually doing just fine with my nearly level 300 character. the problem is he's playing with level 50 weapons and a broken vats system. There's no sense of progression and the game's not fun anymore.  Good games have areas that are designed to be difficult in areas that are designed to be not difficult and the fun is getting to a point where you can handle the difficult ones.  lazy games simply scale the enemies to the level of the player and call it good.
---
I think people underestimated the BOS handin rewards for a very similar reason.
---
The junk ones still work, the automatic misc ones do not alas.
---
Ooooh, that explains it then.
---
Really? You must have been playing with different people than I. Pre-nerf 5-7 minutes was a long time for both Earle and SBQ. The couple I’ve done since have been nearly 20 minutes.
---
Hmm I see I see lemme look.................ok yeah it’s a chassis.
---
That Nuka Shine will teleport you to a bunch of random locations around the map. Power armor may not be an end game item but I certainly didn't have any at level 11. Enjoy it while the battery lasts!
---
As a lone Wanderer, I would say I like the update too.  I ran two dailies alone and was able to win freezing super mutants and melee only robots.  The Ammo factory makes up for fixing the ammo generator.  Love the level scaling as well.
---
I’m doing fine a vanilla commando
---
You embrace it.  You become it
---
If everything is terrifying, nothing is.
---
I feel like I'm playing a different game than some of these people, after one wasteland I can still switch to my non-build weapons like a shotgun (stealth commando running 3 S for Blocker) and two shot most anything in the forest. I feel like people complaining about molerats and stuff aren't even playing the game but just posting reactionary hot takes based off patch notes.
---
I mean you have to unequip some quality of life perks for ones that make you more effective at killing.
---
The end game needed to be more Challenging
---
Try fighting Earle or the Queen, you can't even tickle them any longer!
---
Oh thanks!
---
wow, this breaks my heart. this was hands down my favorite thing in this game ever. 😭
---
This is the worst year ever.
---
Are you sure you know what gatekeeping means?
---
It's a constant thing.    
---
3 times with three different characters and last night was the most recent. There's a page on it and the glitch always happens with the intercom EVERY TIME. I think I waited a week before trying and finally got it done.    
---
What pisses me off, is you start over from the very beginning and have to listen to all that dialogue crap to get them to the same point.
---
Having zero challenge in a shooter type game sounds boring to me.
---
Radiation Rumbles good for legendarys.
---
Oh I get that. It also wasn't so fun for those that found the game way too easy.
---
Like I said, some tuning is required so that both parties can feel that it's fun. I'm pretty sure that we both agree there.
---
They said there is going to be further balancing....
---
I really don't understand why people want respeccing to cost money or be limited at all. It should be available to do whenever players want and how many times they want.
---
It worked in Guild Wars 1 and 2 and is FANTASTIC.
---
Same, running a non-PA glass cannon build with unmodded SS armor and forest mobs just tickle. I do run blocker though.
---
If they did add a slider to One Wasteland, they could probably do it to teams as well. Add 100 to enemy levels in instanced environments or something. Increase chance of legendary enemies with higher settings. I'm not a developer, but I'd think the core functionality already exists with One Wasteland, it would just be a matter of making it user adjustable.
---
They one shot me through secret service armor, that tounge must be armor peircing!
---
I got into fallout because of 3. I’m not happy with this new game style. Mainly because everything is more complex. Not hard just complex. Because of that this makes it ridiculous. You use to be able to fix weapons with other weapons in 3. You can’t do that anymore and all weapons take a lot of supplies. Same for armor. There’s a lot that separates these games but the difficulty is the biggest difference.
---
WORNG!!! Alaways dirnnk thu Nooka Shin!! *:::hiccup:::*

It took me ten tries doing it and both my ultricite power armor legs broke
---
Eugh...
---
Did today's one in 6 minutes flat in my unarmed melee build today.
---
Forbidden Knowledge doesn't trigger that way, you have to find one in world.
---
You wont be able to turn it in for the quest if thats what you are wanting it for
---
Even if you’re alone, or on a private server, if you make a public team you still get the bonuses
---
Make ultracite cores with them and vend or use them.
---
I don’t have an optimized build. Currently my only damage cards are gladiator(3), Gunslinger(3), Modern Renegade(3), then I have inspirational, bodyguards, first aid, and concentrated fire. I don’t play in groups, I solo, but I chose charisma bonuses as I am always in a casual group. Just hit level 25 and for some reason expert gunslinger isn’t showing up.
---
&gt; I shouldn’t have to play the way you do in order to find this game enjoyable
---
Ditto.
---
And that's why he was relocated. It would have been too easy otherwise.
---
I believe they just changed it so you can get multiple mutations on the same server by taking radiation.
---
Greed is EA's trademark. I don't think competence or inability to deliver promised content is their schtick.
---
Or at least that's how it looks from the outside. I haven't played an EA game in a very long time. Partly because of the greed aspect.
---
You’re right, it isn’t a formal essay. It is a forum though and not a group text with your buddies. Constructing a proper sentence is easier to read and I’m sure reactions would’ve been different. 
---
This is actually the best and nicest gaming community if ever been part of. Just saying.
---
I know but we need new weapons to be tradable as we cant pick the legendary affects so its ends up eather we fill are stash with untradable okay weapons or we remove them and loose are hard earned scrip, if we picked are effects on them they i wouldnt care but it really causes problems when i role a junkies and someone needs it when i played bloodied.
---
You can only turn in the last one you picked up yourself.
---
Playing as a bloodied stealth commando i was kinda dissappointed in how easy i found the ops, did 0 ptr, fairly poorly optimized. Had a bit of issues with robots, but both others have been first attempt elder, it's impossible to die, and things die in like 3 hits. 
---
I do not get the outrage
---
I hope so man. In one of the dev interviewed they were talking next year winter. Like Jan-Feb.i really hope not but I wouldn’t be surprised.
---
What event requires black powder kills? I just got my hands on a BE and AAE black powder pistol!!
---
Their website just updated and requires the terms of service to be signed before access to login.
---
But you can't display them.
---
the card that reduces the cost of crits is more efficient I find, it let's me proc a critical hit every two bullets!
---
The jack o lantern from NW doesn’t show up on it though
---
I mean, I have no defenses and sometimes get attacked, but nothing important has ever been broken (rad shower, fusion generator etc). Not sure if it's to do with the location/orientation of my camp, but I'm just downhill of a super mutant spawn, and the side they come from they only ever get a bit of roof/wall, maybe a light fitting or stash box
---
she wuold be my favorite if only you wouldn't so goddamn right
---
I got Marsupial at 27 and had to be very careful until I got Starched genes maxed out at 31 before I could fix my character.    
---
I have yet to pay more than 450 for a single serum. Be patient.
---
Yeah, but you don't have to take all the dmg perks anymore. Bloody mess is garbage
---
Because it’s a game... a challenge... that you need at least some skill to overcome. This isn’t the sims.
---
Its almost like Auntie Beth really wants to sell you some repair kits, doesn't it?
---
It was fun an unique but I liked today's cause its the perfect mix of mutation effects and the arena in which to play in
---
Doesn't work if they get one shorted by the first wolf!
---
Meta matters less now. Yes bloodied is still top but not by as much. Rather than just junkies under bloodied, we have junkies, AA, furious, and TS (if you can manage the accuracy). Additionally on hard hitting weapons you have instigating which is probably one of the only effects that can still mediate 1hit kills.
---
On top of all of that Daily ops make trouble shooters, mutant slayers, and assassins more relevant. Especially on the armor side.
---
If you mean when you die and try to take toxic goo, shoot a bullet first then take it. It'll work
---
I have a 2 Star Quad Fixer. I have the plans for it and can make a level 50 one if you're on PC.
---
It’s one of the challenges. I need Atoms so I can buy some new sofas lol
---
if you fire out the emote and switch to the map fast enough,  you can use photo mode while an emote is active. but it's a pain in the ass to get it to work, thus adding to photo mode would be sweet.
---
Damn right!
---
Challenge is great and I welcome it!  But having areas become easy and enemies that you can slap around when you get some power, that's also great.
---
I'm glad Bethesda is trying to make things better and add challenge. But there is certainly some work to be done before things are right. Maybe some challenge has been added, but plenty of frustration also. And I still regularly see players who melt high level enemies so fast that no one else can get a hit. Hell, on one of my brothers level 114 guy, he just sent me a video of him fighting 3 legendary scorchbeasts at the same time, a glowing diseased wendigo, and a ton of level 100 scorched by himself without much trouble. I mean, feeling like rambo with a fifty cal is awesome, but come on. That should be a fight you run from when you are alone. Or have to at least draw this away and user cover and lots of stims and buffs.  Not one you just stand there and take the pain while unloading multiple cans of ammo into everything.
---
I want a challenge Bethesda, please give it to me!  But the way it is right now, it's not the way to do it!  The real challenge is still lacking. But the frustration and annoyance is ramped up.
---
&gt;I dont work in the gaming industry but I can tell you this: users who are upset with your product will always use words like "laughing stock" and will suggest all sorts of things about your company's reputations.
---
You clearly haven't been paying attention to the media surrounding this game. I don't mean that guy on youtube yapping away but all gaming media.
---
Laughing stock is a reflection of reality. Not literally laughing at them of course but they're certainly looked down upon as being incompetent. Why not shift that within the means that they have.
---
Bethesda is clearly nickel and diming this game given that they are a multi studio, multi billion (with a b) dollar corporation. They have the resources. They just don't want to put them towards this game.
---
The least Bethesda can do is work within their means. At least they wouldn't appear anywhere near as incompetent as they currently are. That's precisely my point.
---
Lel, I'm 61 now and I actually an making my build even better. Sure I may not be able to take hits like a tank or deal damage like a bloodied, but I'm always there for suport. If you need a revive, im there for you. You need backup,I'm there for you. I just got the fr3indly fire perk and a flamer to go with it
---
Honestly I was spending too much time anyway playing this game.  I'll set out this season not pay for the membership and see where things go in the future.  either they'll get things under control and it'll become fun again or it'll die and maybe they'll work on a new project.  Although more likely they'll just keep milking this until they can milk it no more.
---
Sadly I'm not noticing any difference in how effective my laser and ultracite lasers are since last patch.
---
Seems to take a clip of bloodied laser torso shots to kill a super mutant. A clip and a half of bloodied ultracite laser to kill the same super mutant. Vs a half clip of bloodied handmade. Maybe I am using them wrong? Does that match with your results?
---
At least you're being honest.
---
Its because more bullets are needing to be expended, weapon damage is done every time it tags an enemy.
---
This is why two shot and explosives breaks faster because both trigger multiple tags.
---
Why wouldn't it?
---
yes - it has always been like that . Back when TS weapon got nerferd - the TS versions of explosive weapons ( AGL , fatman , missile launcher ) didnt.  So TS has always been superior.
---
Igxjvgzkgxufzkgckfzjtde5usitfxmh ltzurzzkhxitzlhxitslycoyocaa!!!!!
---
That better?  I think it is.
---
;)
---
No, stop with the nerfs. This isn't some super competitive e-sport game. Make every gun viable with buffs.
---
I collected 23 of them only to find out you need a fresh one each time. 
---
Thought I was being really clever hoarding them along with “tokens” which seemed important but do nothing at all.
---
I’m still having an issue with the quest for the camera. I got my camera a while ago, but I still have a quest to investigate Anne/Ansel. When I inspect the corpse, there’s nothing on the body. Therefor I can not complete the quest, and the quest is permanently stuck in my pip boy.
---
100% agree. My build is so far from optimized and I'm doing absolutely fine. I used to run shotguns and got bored so I'm in the process of respeccing into heavy guns. I have no heavy guns perks and I'm just using a set of x01 and Beckett's 50 cal you get at the end of his quest and no enemies are sponging me and I'm contributing well to SBQ and ACP. The bonus xp is making the respeccing so much nicer too
---
Headshots and it’ll depend on the enemy type of course, and which type of resistance they have. 
---
So far Most ghouls, blood eagles, certain Super mutants, pretty much any animal take really nice headshot damage (I’m hitting them without any sneak for between 180-280)
---
I forgot to include on launch, I figured to ask because from what I read only PS4 games that released after June are guaranteed for PS5, and only like really popular games will also be day one ready. I was wondering if this was confirmed to be one of those or not yet.
---
Most PS4 games are expected to be backwards compatible without any issue. 
---
The question is if PS5 will improve performance without a patch. 
---
The second question is if Bethesda will offer a free “next generation” upgrade.
---
From what I can tell it’s only the specific ones for the combat rifle.
---
Its pretty easy mode my fastest run not even coordinated was 6:05
---
I would love it if they made it so people on your friends list can build right next to you so you could have a town, also if they fixed phantom budget.
---
I took a different approach. I carry 9 shotguns. They're not all going to break.
---
It means that some people are just complete morons, and think every latency ghost, and lag reflex is "HaXOrz".
---
Just laugh at them, and move on.
---
Aye I saw that, was just thinking if it'd be worth reverting it given the numbers they pushed away
---
Didnt even know about the free fast travel, thats badass
---
Nuke shine is great!
---
Want a new adventure?
---
Need a Surprise?
---
Or just to Challenge yourself?
---
BOOM!!
---
NukaShine.
---
Oh is it most? I wasn’t 100% sure about that and yeah definitely good questions there
---
Critical savy. 
---
H-t- and I have a long discussion about crit savy and how you can use it to manipulate your crit cycle based on your overall luck.
---
Sounds about right for a Bethesda fix. Good thing it's not benefiting the players in any way or they might just disable it.
---
Whattttt
---
Thanks didnt know
---
Who cares, if you're not doing anything wrong you won't be banned. Just block and ignore the dipshit.
---
Yeah they haven’t said like 100% of games will. Just that “most will”. I can’t see an issue with FO76 not running since FO4 is confirmed to run on PS5 as part of the PS Plus collection and it’s the same engine.
---
Yeah that plus unyielding is so good, I just hold down fire and crit at the same time and ap is the only limiting factor!
---
It has punctuation.......
---
Yeah I wanted that door, too.
---
Casual builds are fine. The big changes hit those who stacked perks and equipment, folks just playing only have to worry about the enemy level changes.
---
So are raids in or out now? Not high enough level anyway but just curious
---
Tell your mom that a random grandpa asked her to tell that guy to go fuck himself, and ignore such comments.
---
Yeah the jack o lantern skin from NW for the combat rifle is available to put on the fixer but nothing shows up once you apply it. Just was giving a heads up. Until it gets fixed my fixer will be rocking the Dark Matter from the legendary run
---
I have paid attention to FO76 news that interests me. I notice the bugs, the missed deadlines, the issues just as you do. I won't get into an argument about subjective news consumption with you, as I think you're keen enough to know what I mean.
---
Our main point of disagreement is this: I dont think the issues you point to have as big of an impact on sales or the strategy of Bethesda as you clearly do. 
---
Unless one of us has access to Beth's finances, however, this is all this will ever be: a disagreement between two people who dont have the full picture.
---
There's no challenge with commando or any build that uses auto weapons. The only real challenge is keeping up with ammo demands and I'd hardly call that challenging.
---
Magic shotgun!
---
It got updated just a few hours after the update and works like a charm again. Such a good mod (and mod author)
---
Unless you want to start over (more lost time) then stick with it until 50.    
---
My main is a Stealth Sniper. CHA is 4 always b/c I run solo.    
---
The top of this page shows what perks affect which weapon types. Book mark it.    
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_weapons](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_weapons)    
---
Use the Nukes and Dragons site pinned at the top of this sub to make your build. At the bottom of the page after you're done is a Level by Level perk list. Follow it.
---
That's not true.
---
Making games of this nature means hiring people who specialize in various aspects of the whole production. I know, I used to work at Midway Games a long time ago. 
---
There's no way they can just fix bugs. Some people on the game staff have no idea how to do that. So what? They should be let go until new all the bugs are fixed and they can start putting out new content? If your an artists working on Fallout, and they stop putting out new content in favor of fixing everything, they aren't going to pay you to sit around. If there's not room for another artist on another game, then you are let go. Many artists work are project status workers. They are kept on as long as there is work. 
---
Just focusing on fixing bugs would put a lot of people out of work. That's bad for business. 
---
The game, most complex games, will never be bug free. There's factors that aren't under a companies control, when you are trying to make online games. 
---
Here's an example. You hear people complain about long load screens. I upgraded the hard drive in my PS4 based on my computer engineer friends advice, and he helped me, and it cut my load screens down to a 2-4 seconds from an average of 10-15 seconds. Sometimes longer on certain nights. 
---
That's not something under Bethesda's control. But people blame Beth for the long loadscreens. /shrug

Some bugs are incredibly hard to track down. There's a whole list of things they have to know first, before they can begin to figure out where the issue is and fix it. If you can't reproduce a bug, you can't fix it. Because you'll have no idea in the billions of lines of code where to start. 
---
Sorry, but stopping everything to just fix bugs isn't going to happen. It would hurt the game in the long run. Because the lack of new content would be felt quickly, and players would get bored and leave. Plus, it would take years to do what your suggesting.
---
Ok!   
---
I was thinking it was someone being irrational, but the new event just launched and I am like oh no are we doing something naughty on accident
---
Thank you for the peace of mind!
---
It’s not a hard fight with the right build. It was never an easy fight as a gunslinger and now I’m dead weight to other players unless they need a revive. I’ll be benching that toon for the time being.
---
Nothing has been announced. But it will be backward compatible most likely if that helps
---
You mean after like a few days everybody is still learning shit? OMFG! the OUTRAGE!
---
Wow - you just gave me horrible flashbacks to my working days.  I am so glad I'm retired now.  All I do now when interacting with people is say what I can do and people can just fuck right off if they think it's too much or not enough.  I say that in nicer words of course.  ;)
---
Boosting is generally,  when a higher level or more experienced player “carries” a lower player or helps them out, don’t know what your mother could have been doing but the guy might have misinterpreted what he was seeing.
---
I honestly thought a clean toilet or bath would be coming in this season, since we got the sink last time
---
Wait is this upcoming?
---
I bounced from the hunters shack.  To abbies bunker.  Easy to the swamp.  South to the power plant. West to the model home.  Started back north.   Nothing.   Fast travelled to Braxton medical cause it’s usually good.  Nothing (full of friendly raiders).  Went to harpers ferry.  Cleared it out.  Nothing.   Was about to go into the burrows when I noticed that Leader of the Pack finally proc’d.  So I rushed over there and found the 3 guaranteed legendaries.  (Nice that they are lvl50 now - even if only 1star)
---
But yeah.  Like 2hrs of solid playing this evening with zero legendaries found anywhere I went.
---
Dead serious! I have a 3* bloodied gauntlet with dps 350 buff it damage is 400. Definitely not one shotting lvl 100 death claws, had a 3* bloodied meat hook with a base damage of 1200 before patch and now it’s 245 pretty useless! They shouldn’t have nerfed melee/unarmed so much considering you have to get up close and personal to deal damage lol I used so many stimpacks in the half hour that I played, that I haven’t bothered to pick the controller back up! I don’t have a back up character to fall back on as I purely concentrated my time on my unarmed. Definitely not enjoying this patch.
---
I don’t think they need to revert anything. They game objectively was too easy and certain weapons were way too powerful. The way damage is calculated now, it is much easier to make adjustments.
---
My camp should come with a PSA....When fast travelling to this area please don’t walk forward after spawning,because you will fall off a cliff and die.
---
The Daily ops are great. Did several back to back. But now i'm swamped with stimpacks an radaway...
---
Bos more like pos am I right
---
3 days of hitting Elder - no rare rewards
---
This has been a bug since beta, never fixed.
---
I want an emote to use while huffing the wheelbarrow by my camp's Brahmin.
---
X2 on that question
---
Hopefully this is a bug that gets patched.  Very annoying to buy things from atom shop and unlock new things from the new scoreboard only to find I've got to delete half my camp to use them.
---
The Valley galleria mutants, one clip 5.56 per, then frozen can't reload, dead.
---
Chances are you'll have to pay again. It's Bethesda.
---
They babble on about it in the foundation, Sunny and Sam.
---
Yeah I don’t have that one so couldn’t look thx 👍🏻
---
Oh I only play a single character and switch between melee/heavy builds when I want since they go hand in hand. I’ve always got 100+ notes and I’ve actually ran out of repair kits because TSE things just go through their durability like crazy.
---
They'd need to be firmly placed though, and not pick-up-able by others. Hell, even in FO4 it was a nightmare, arranging your table all nice only to find your cutlery all over the place when you came back
---
My crew are loving this new mode, we run a full squad of vanguard builds so we are literally able to run through the enemies while taking next to no damage.
---
We completed the vault 94 op yesterday at around 6:40 overall which we were stoked about.
---
I finally was able to take on assaultrons yesterday!
---
Reroll for a magic version, you will get that damage again, not on the numbers, but you will on the damage!
---
read it in a fast sense and maybe not get bent at words 😂 this fool
---
What ammos or guns do you need/want as well? You can add me

1. You need to make a build using the Nukes and Dragons site. Learn what they are as not knowing what to do and trying to do everything will result in a ruined character and more lost time; which you cannot get back.
---
2. Aside from getting the best gear you can, keep your CAMP simple. Sell everything else except for some food, drinks, chems, etc. Don't hoard everything.
---
3. Resources are everywhere. In any crafting bench, you can Tag for Search an item you need.
---
4. You can find and make more ammo. I suggest keeping a melee weapon that does good damage on you to save using ammo so often.
---
5. Craft the Tinkerer's and Weapons workbench first.
---
6. Play and learn. Die a lot. Learn better. Die more. Learn better. Repeat.
---
User flair checks out.
---
You’re obviously a hacker.
---
I get that some builds were OP. But does everything have to level up? Does the wasteland really need level 50 mole rats?! I have done a few events and wolves and alpha hounds take like 6 shots each or more with an anti-armor handmade. That is ludicrous.
---
I'm a non-meta player, and I take offense to you speaking for me.  Or assuming you can speak for 'all of us'.
---
How very dare you.
---
I wish bethesda would see that RMTers make alot more money off of untradable weapons that require a mod to trade, than they do off of normal and that they are helping people sell hacked stuff instead of just allowing players to buy it off of other players venders
---
3 is true and it has been for months!
---
Yeah.  But it has to fire.  :) — My concern was that random ones in non-events seem to be showing up far less frequently.
---
Fireproof is already so good that I have been wondering the same thing
---
I think I’d shit myself in anger at that to be honest, I still have a shred of hope for Bethesda they’re not 2K yet
---
It wasn’t a full suit of power armor is was actually just the chassis which apparently has no level requirement.
---
The game has basically become **Ammo Crafting 76**, thankful for the Ammo Legendary perk, still will need to mine more lead and scrap for steel more often.
