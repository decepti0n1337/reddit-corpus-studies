In the coming updates they are increasing the range of the turrets to the max range of players.  This should make them be able to return fire on any enemies (and players) that attack them.

i didn't know this, thanks for posting :)

Is there any chance you used the slide bar to put all but 10 in your stash. Then logged into survival and died over and over.....chances are you did not have room so they never went to your stash. Let's say you have room for 99 in your stash if you use the slide bar and try to deposite 102, none of them go in.
---
What enemies spawned with this type of mayhem? 
---
I collected a full set of troubleshooter armor and made the run once. It was stupid easy, but then I had to run home and swap out before going to the nuke zone. 
---
Nope just a barrel mod. My first Tesla was a lobbing barrel. 
---
Omw
---
Hard Reset? Why not just AltF4? O.o
---
Yeah so where can I get one?
---
I hoping everything I read about player vending showing up on the map for all players is true, so I don't have to worry about my, close, but still off the beaten track, vending machine not being visited.
---
I always found that sad for the robots inside. What happened to them? Are they floating in darkness or were they released into the wasteland as well?
---
They are rare, someone stated you cannot learn that mod, you must loot a tesla with it attached. It's cool, but could be better.
---
How about a visit at Camden Park? Might still be a bit early in the season of it opening, but you never know..
---
Certainly don't, no. I do plan on getting fo4 and lore is my favorite part, so thanks for not spoiling for me. 
---
And the shotty they was supposed to be part of it doesn‚Äôt work 
---
That's what I'm suspecting happened.  I've never met anyone who keeps 200 lbs free in their stash, waiting for a couple hundred Stimpaks to be deposited.
---
always put it in something. 
---
a suitcase at the vendors, overseers cache, etc.
---
when you log out your bag disappears.
---
if you put it in something, it will stay.
---
Yea it sounds like you‚Äôve picked a spawn point
---
Seems like the one hit limiter was added to ai enemies on accident or on purpose? Almost every swing does the sound but no damage and I have to swing again to kill them. 
---
When the legendary vendor comes out, you'll be able to scrap all those legendaries and get a reward for them.
---
Happens to me to. This last nerf destroyed melees ability to repeat 
---
On my way
---
Wild how the majority of this sub is so defensive over these duped weapons and are so easy to brush them off.
---

---
Probably because you'll find a majority of the players with duped weapons are here. Most of them through the various subreddits considering that was the main way to get them.
---
Sad really.
---
Like a said, im bad and new ahah
---
As stated, I'm playing on PS4 so no mods.
---
+karma
---
Dunno.  Maybe cross reference the trailer for the locarion?
---
... Darryl gets sentimental. Moonshine does that.
---
Population on the server was about half. We questioned whether it would last. I think Whitesprings would have cost Bethesda about 30k caps when their server melted. This was pretty stable.
---
Actually come to think of it there's a change you will definitely like.  SB's no longer continuously spam that annoying energy attack - it now has a minimum 10 second delay between attacks, so you're no longer blinded continuously.  Of course if you're fighting 3 at once that's still a hell of a challenge but those would be rare circumstances.
---
Bam! This guy right here! 1000 times yes! You hit the nail on the head and I think you gave a great idea for a fix too. It brings in more balance, makes your pieces better, more customizable, and more expensive when you go to sell them. Non-PA legendary slots and a way of obtaining them for your current gear (which I wasnt even daring to dream for) 
---
I'll join too.
---
Just give us a FO4-style permanent perk system, but with SPECIAL limitations so that we can't have every single perk.
---
In my opinion, the devs had an interesting idea with card-swapping to change builds, but didn't test and refine it enough to make it better or funner than the FO4 system. In my opinion, it is not better at all, and is significantly less fun to use.
---
they must have misunderstood. it doesn't show that particular stat on the inspect page
---
Absolutely nothing. Zero perk cards for sneaking
---
A few glowing ones, rad scorpions, some scorched, and a metric shit ton of level 60+ super mutants. Like a few hundred between the prison, dam and workshop that we activated to draw more from. Insane amount of them, which of course brings steel and gunpowder as well as more caps!
---
I've done similar with my Auto Grenade Launcher and MIRV grenades. I've sent many enemies into space and I giggle like mad every time, when I see the corpses go flying 50ft into the air.
---
Go in a building, any one really, pick up all the junk you see. Exit the building. Scrap all junk. Repeat. 
---
The sirens went off for 2 minutes... 
---
Sadly names will only be for you.  They don't attach to the item. 
---
Only you will see the names.
---
Just be a man and fight them 
---
Really? Thats so dissapointing
---
I hope someday that loot is entirely redone obsoleteing all existing gear after all expoilts have been fixed. Loot is boring I want it to be less boring and be able to gear it more towards a specific play style than you can right now.
---
Now I‚Äôm sad
---
Oh wow
---
The grenades? They can be crafted after finishing the enclave storyline.
---
Thanks, any ideas on the other ones? Like nuclear material and copper?
---
Our way aren‚Äôt that of those who have fallen before us, we have risen from the ashes and seek to work with the other groups out in the wastes. Our enemies are not each other but the scorched and the mutants of Appalachia ü§ù
---
Oh I haven‚Äôt done that yet
---
Same and scream oh S#!T üòÇ
---
Instruction unclear, dick stuck in combat shotgun 
---
They are a blessing üòé

[removed]
---
I bet
---
And having 12 mod slots and increased resistances in PA sounds pretty balanced to the 5 basic and 15 legendary mod slots with regular armor. And I think it would be cool to see the hardened/shielded/enameled PA piece variants that only added more resistances to PA. (much in the same way that regular armor can be moded with hardened/enameled/shadowed/etc.)
---
Probably done just to avoid issues that would come from being able to exchange items with fake names, and what not.
---
The word griefer is predominately being used by salty dummies that don‚Äôt understand how easy it is to avoid PvP. They‚Äôre congregating in this thread and downvoting anyone who points out their lack of understanding. It‚Äôs amusing. 
---
If these duped weapons are so abundant, then get ahold of them yourself. No, you can't, because truth be told its not all that easy to get a good weapon. People arent selling their good gear for peanuts because there are fewer of them on the market every day due to old dupers/players leaving the game with their gear.
---
Save the caps and items to trade to get what you need like everyone else. Its not impossible to get these good pvp equips, but they're not handed to you.
---
This post reeks of jealousy and lack of high end game knowledge.
---
1500 caps
---
Yeah thats true. Name a basic weapons ‚Äúrecoil compensated armor piercing‚Äù or what not and you have a scam on hands
---
Oh that will be amazing. Thanks!
---
What times are you usually on? 
---
1 camp 1 tent
---
I did tell them the truth in multiple support tickets and I destroyed everything when they removed the ban  a couple weeks ago but then they rebanned and I sent another support ticket and they gave the same response 
---
This post isn't about dupers, it's about the weapons themselves. Yes dupers caused it but it's up to Bethesda to fix them. There is no point alienating someone over what was done. They dupe they get banned that's it's end of story
---
usually from 9:30pm onwards 
---
I think it would be neat to unlock a quest at level 80+ to reset stats. Make it part of the game lore. Something along the lines of either an experimental mutation potion gone bad or even a cloning procedure that resets your special for redistribution.
---
Well balls now I'll have to respec lol. At least you can respec a point per level unlike originally when it was every ten levels beyond 50
---
That is my main hope, I want all builds to be visible. Gear needs to give a player a small edge at best, not make the gap between a legendary kitted player and a naked player massive. If Bob as a cool build thats focused around eating dogfood and using a rolling pin, he should be just as affective as someone who googled how to be good at fallout 76 and followed the first YouTube video 
---
u/bethesdagamestudios

&amp;#x200B;
---
I think it will show up on the map and I think you‚Äôll be able to put your camp in pacifist mode. This is mostly for roll playing. 
---
they scale by the level of the region, for example the forest is lvl 1-15, toxic valley 5-20 and cranberry bog 40-50. the low level events are good for getting gear for new alt characters even on high level characters without having to grind for hours on the new one
---
thanks I'mma try this.  it does take up 200mb ram in just the launcher.  so us 8gb guys could use every bit we have atm.
---
u/bethesdagamestudios_
---
Aight cool I'll check out times
---
As all other bonuses each is a % of base and not compounded.
---
I‚Äôll probably be on Monday around that time. I‚Äôll send you a friend invite and check out your selection 
---
Agreed, and thanks for letting me know.
---
Ok
---
Wait, what wandering vendor bot? Not Grom I'm assuming?
---
Ironically my partner got a TES handmade drop not super long after a random dude dropped a (presumably, probably) duped one at his feet (guy was going around giving everyone in the area stuff, not sure why)
---
yut, just find their pattern and sneak on by
---
Took out a level 8 3\* Radrat in the Toxic Valley today. You're not alone, but I have to imagine that 3\* is 3\* when it comes to the legendary vendor tokens whether its a junkies lead pipe or a bloodied combat rifle. So just keep your goodies in your stash and one day, hopefully, they'll be worth something.
---
If joining someone it shows a campfire with their name if they‚Äôre in survival
---
Wixon farmstead is a spawn point?
---
This is one of the coolest things I‚Äôve read about Fallout. Y‚Äôall have done a great job at this. Are there any other mysteries/conspiracies that your group plans on investigating?
---
Responders vendor bot.
---
I created a new character to try it out but haven‚Äôt had time to do much other than get out of the vault and kill those first Liberators.
---
Didn't you get your Vault Tec catheter?
---
Gotcha. I play pc, so wasn't sure
---
If enemies keep spawning there then yea 
---
There's a rare Responder  vendor spawn by Charelston Train station. He's not the bot in the station itself,  the rare vendor spawns on the other side of the tracks by the barn. He  sells plans for a Cuckoo Clock and Nuka Cola bottlecap clock that are pretty nifty. He's the only vendor in the game that sells them as well.
---
P.S.: He also sells rare and unique outfits
---
589
---
Just play on the toilet, problem solved.  
---
I just painted up a spare set so it's not a big deal if I lose it. Might as well look cool while I can.
---
No it does not. This may be the case if you are friends with them. I am staring at my recent players list at the person I know is in survival...no campfire.  
---
Also I specifically mentioned I joined them from Xbox not through Fallout so even if the campfire symbol was correct, it still wouldn't matter here.
---
They are releasing player vending on the 9th....
---
It's the camp one that u buy from the atomic shop
---
I did but it was nylon instead of the canvas they promised.
---
Oh
---
well hes like a guy who has a hangover. Talking quietly because anything loud is giving him headaches. Although he has no actual head. Robobrain jokes !
---
Damn
---
Yep, I hope your class works as you'd like, I don't regret going bloodied at all. I just don't use it in nuke zones.
---
Jealousy and high end game knowledge. What the fuck is high end game knowledge. I currently have a number of TSE weapons in my Inventory, I have traded players for bloodied weapons in the past. I sold some sentinel gear because I don't see the point of it. I am currently running around with a plasma rifle because i like how they look. I care little for god tier builds. If I wanted to I could easily use the same shit as most players in survival but unlike those guys, I don't find it fun to onehit people. This game is about so much more than PvP. Your comment shows you missed the point entirely, maybe your the one who has the issues. Don't try to antagonise someone who is trying to help make.the game better for all. 
---
I know but even then the lack of info on it doesn't make me hopefull. Also it relies on players coming to your camp. My camp is next to the whitespring train station and yet no one ever comes over when they see it
---
Had a level 14 at the last queen fight I did. So either an alt and/or there with friends. Health went down a heap a few times but we made sure to clear off any mobs from him.
---
Deal. I‚Äôll take it. 
---
&gt;  I personally think most people would be ok with Bethesda removing all of them.
---
that would be the final nail in the coffin for many players,first they nerf whitesprings xp (nobody asked for this) then they nerf TSEs into the ground so the game became craftammo76 and now they take the gear you worked for? lmao just no
---
Not true. I just completed two events in a cranberry bog in both of the 3-star legendaries at the end were level 23 and 25.  Im 166. 
---
Well right now there's really no incentive to go see anyone elses camp. I can do everything I want at mine. Crafting. Sleeping. Etc.
---
However, if there's a vending machine at your camp that I can buy stuff from that I need, the likelihood of me stopping by to peruse goes up by about 100%.
---
&gt; still a necessity in PVE
---
TSEs were pretty much mandatory for SBQ,so many people afk or those that did not pull their weight that it was unreal
---
whats TIL?
---
also is there a best workshop to grind for this?
---
I find a corner, put my back to it, facing out, and tell whichever kid is closest to left click if anything attacks.
---
To be honest I think you might have converted me. I was running vanguards but I feel like bloodied/adrenal really packs a wallop 
---
Today I Learned
---
I add everyone I trade with I suggest just doing that so you‚Äôre not blind sided then, but yeah they should fix that regardless
---
lol, there that's and watching youtbu on the side is why I don't often play multiplayer, 76, maybe a battlefield or titain fall but that's the only one
---
&gt; but the dupers ruined the uniqness of this legendary since day one
---
without duped gear  no one would have done SBQ 
---
Scorched are very simplified enemies compared to raiders, I think part of it is intentional, and unintentional.  I've never really seen them use many advanced tactics, sometimes they take cover, but I don't think I've ever seen them do things like blindfire, or throw grenades.
---
It's probably intentional in the sense that they're really just bodies capable of shooting, but not advanced tactics.  And probably unintentional with how barebones their appearance is.  
---
They almost never seen to be using the weapon they're visibly shooting, and they also don't drop the same one either.
---
Too much hate? You know that's complete bullshit. Bethesda deserved a hell of a lot of flack for how they released 76. Don't come at us with the weak ass excuse that it got "too much hate." Every bit of criticism which was levied against 76 was well deserved.
---
It's called panic. I don't normallty do that ever, but that was the quickest way to cut off the mugging. 
---
Same here.... high level zones with low level horde legendries. Rarely see a horde event with a high level legendary
---
Thanks so much!
---
Rofl I'm doing a little more legendary farming then usual but this seems way to frequent
---
To the people that would find it as the final Nail in the coffins, why ? I'm not going to pretend the game doesn't need balance, but Bethesda are listening and trying. The last balance patch made heavy and energy weapons far more useable. If you can't give up your over powered weapons that were duped into existence, for the greater good of the game. Then maybe you shouldn't be playing the game in the first place. I have many items that were probably duped, my favourites being my bomber jacket and travelers leather coat. If I had to lose them so the game would get better then so be it.
---
I got it from Tyler County Track
---
It works with and without power armor.
---
Ya my power armor too, feel like its degrading quicker.
---
Thank you and thanks for the gold!!
---
Oh it does lol. I'm not specced melee, but my bloodied Mr handy does 271 every half second. Grognaks is 958, bloodied dragon is 1300, bloodied explosive harpoon with flechettes is 1200. Ctrl, Alt, Delete. Lol
---
yeah no pvp should always be the last priority in a mmo that and its thanks to duped gear that people are nuking fissure site prime and killing her in time
---
completely missing the point... and your camp is about the same size as mine. 
---
Lots of games had shitty launches, like skyrim, and you all rave about that so fucking much 
---
Yeah. Heard about someone just sprinkling TSE shotguns to everyone when duping instructions were being posted on You Tube.
---
Right? I made a new character with a new account specifically for survival to separate it from my main that runs around in adventure. My lvl 2 alt managed to hold his own against campers over lvl 50. Yes i did not have the gear and mutations but my strategies in PvP is what kept him alive. From a lvl 2 running around but naked with only a lead pipe to now a lvl 34 with a marksmans hardened rifle, no legendary effects, one piece of wood chameleon armor and im still taking on guys over lvl 100 with whatever it is they roll with. I find mines to be useful now more than ever. 
---
Spot on. My biggest grievance is not the existence of them, it is the disparity of people having them where it wasn't earned through in-game methods causing a severe unbalance in game play. I want PvP, it sounds fun. And if I go up against a player levels ahead of me, sure, I'll probably get whooped. AMD it will be a fun challenge. But if some level 3 comes to take my workshop and demolishes me with a legendary weapon in 1 or 2 shots? That's not fun PvP, that's just lame because there is NO WAY to even stand a chance in level playing.
---
My friend bought a FE+ faster movement while ADS Handmade at the Harper's Ferry bot, I traded him a stimpak recipe for it.  Not sure if it was duped or not but...I don't know why anyone would sell it toa random vendor...unless they didn't see the extra perks...later on I found a 1\* Furious Handmade..
---
Oh wow. Does he sell any unique-to-him items?
---
Basically my rule is going to be if I'm selling customers have to join and travel to me.
---
&gt;If you can't give up your over powered weapons
---
those so called overpowered weapons were what kept bulletsponges in check and prevented the game from being craftammo76 
---
&gt;The last balance patch made heavy and energy weapons far more useable
---
they are still garbage due to the way armor works in this game
---
&gt;for the greater good of the game
---
keep that preachy shit away from me ty
---
&gt;Then maybe you shouldn't be playing the game in the first place
---
speak for yourself thank you
---
They probably thought you were playing a super mean trick on them. Hopefully he tried again! 
---
A one star .50 cal machine gun can take them out from the sky in less than a minute. Many times I killed them while they were crawling out of the fissures. Explosive weapon isn‚Äôt necessary. I have a primed explosive 50 cal but don‚Äôt use it much. The loot is the real issue, maybe five out of a hundred dropped ultracite weapon plans (including duplicates), the rest are just lame armor pieces which I scrap immediately. Now I don‚Äôt go out to kill them unless I need to, like when I‚Äôm picking violet ferns and they have to be in the way. 
---
YES! power armor display for all five types!!!!
---
The Point Pleasant Cargobot swarm's a rather common, yet unusual sight. I personally like to sit on the waterfront and watch them swirl around
---
I didn‚Äôt even think of the amount of super mutants that would be there, how was the legendary spawn rate? 
---
I would for sure delete the game if they removed my stuff because they thought it was 'duped'. My TSE was given to me when for free, and I still have it. I felt Absolutely no pity killing people with that thing since my previous PvP encounters were complete jokes. At least my TSE gave me an edge, but I also normally avoided PvP. Actually only used my TSE for SB and PvP. 
---
I still feel zero shame since melee builds are pretty laughable. Although I won't care once pacifist mode let's me avoid PvP together.
---
I‚Äôve done 2 silo runs, 1 I was solo, 1 I had someone more than double my level (I‚Äôm level 48). The solo run took me about an hour or so and I brought about 4000 rounds for me 50 cal and used them all along with around 30 stimpacks and used all of those. I ended up using all of my purified water and food as well. This could‚Äôve been operator error or I was undergeared, not really sure. The second run with my buddy I brought 6000 rounds and 40 stimpacks and used most of those and it took about 45 minutes. The assaultrons just burn through your health so fast and if you don‚Äôt take them out first you‚Äôll be hammered by other robots as well as having your health burned through so fast by those things.
---
On another note, what platform are you on?
---
Be slightly picky on the building for nuke material... but almost all mats in game can be found with this method
---
Out of curiosity of own weapon choices, how do you fair with a handmade or 50 cal? I'm  semiautomatic/heavy build so I'm wondering how much more damage you do than me
---
I‚Äôll send you a video of me killing people. It‚Äôs def not hard.
---
Thanks!
---
but how do you get back on the same server?
---
Oh ok, sorry thought it was side sort of weekly info thing lol
---
Hunters long coat that is highly desirable by people.  Super rare chance for him to have it in his inventory.
---
Clean space suit
---
A couple of clock plans
---
 Other random items.
---
I wish they add more reason to go to camps, maybe some sort of object you place that can giv eyou and anyone, who enters a buff as long as they are not hostile to you
---
PC. It does sound daunting but doable. Guess I'll have to gear up a bit more before this though. Assaultrons are nasty, yeah. Hate those things.
---
I hate how much I would enjoy doing this 
---
K
---
I dont like handmades, I think they are over rated. I'm selling a level 35 bloodied one that does 228 damage for me. My .50 hunting does 490 damage. My TSE gatling gun does 420.
---
Beautiful CAMP! My place looks like Dr Doom's fortess. Built it on stacked foundations with steel walls and roof. Essentially tough base but not pretty - looks ominous actually. Makes it tougher for scortchbeasts or griefers to destroy. Thinking about making it more homey now that I observed no  high level creatures or griefers have showed up since setting up shop about 3 weeks ago. 
---
Charlestown was always buggy for me so I avoided it. Was hard to get the recruitment blues quest done when you have to go to the DMV there.
---
I just presumed it was in game not my end.
---
I would also like to know about this. My gunslinger relies on crit and id like to know whether it works better to have hardened vs severe 
---
I've wanted something like this for a while @bethesda please do this 
---
My favorite thing to do is track down players at their camp, pull out my Santa Power Armor, and throw down some 2-3 star legendary gear. I get to see a lot of awesome camps this way. People enjoy different things
---
The only plan I ever got from them was the underarmor mod plans (besides the paints)
---
Agree, I just don't bother opening safes or hacking stuff anymore because it would require me to constantly switch cards, it's pretty annoying already having to swap to Ammosmith and Super Duper every time I want to craft ammo, or having to equip Weapon Artisan every time I want to repair my weapons.
---
They could change all those non-combat related cards to be passive effects as long as you have enough S.P.E.C.I.A.L points to equip them, so for example if you want to have the effects of Super Duper 3 and Ammosmith 2 as a passive bonuses your build would need at least 2 agility and 3 luck.
---
Or they could add perk card presets so you could change to another set of already unlocked cards with 1 click as long as you are out of combat.
---
My toon is the toughest survivor in the wasteland, all he eats are scorched beast body parts. He's overrun with the stuff.
---
I'm not 100% sure if it was an official post, I think it was, but I read that having your CAMP vendor will make it a fast travel point.
---
Is Assassin‚Äôs a good legendary effect compared to Anti-armor and Bloodied? It‚Äôs only extra 10% isn‚Äôt it? 
---
The workshop events give random plans. I got most of my plans from repeated workshop defends.   I‚Äôve bought a few here and there too.
---
There‚Äôs a few small ones we‚Äôve been looking at related to the fissures. We are super interested in the new northern vault, and other tiny details. 
---
In a similar vein, we like odd coincidences. Yesterday, Graham was standing over a nuked fissure, and said, ‚ÄúChally the Moo Moo picks all the best places to trade. Promise!‚Äù It‚Äôs so funny that I can‚Äôt help but think it‚Äôs a feature. 
---
Clearly it is if you have to server hop and the enemies are much higher level than you lol 
---
That's why I only do them in the Bog now. They can still be low level but higher chance of high levels. Have even had a lvl 50 mongrel horde
---
76 is fucking broken. From the ground up, nearly every single thing with the fucking game is flawed. Skyrim, not so much.
---
In saying that,, I know there are massive issues with Skyrim. It's a serviceable game, but that's about it. There are myriads of problems with the game and you ned to mod it, in order to make it a great experience. So no, I don't rave about it so fucking much. How about you actually ask what my positions are, instead of instantly subscribing positions to me that I don't hold. Did that thought ever cross your thick skull? Obviously not.
---
Thirdly, the amount of bugs in 76 are far, far, far more numerous than the bugs in Skyrim. And USLEEP read like a fucking novel. In order to outbug Skyrim, a lot of shit needs to hit the fan. And it did with 76.
---
And please..., Shut the door on your way out.
---
Only because higher level players had been in the area.
---
Yeah, things aren‚Äôt right, lol.  Idk what‚Äôs going ok üòÇ
---
Spawn somewhere else lol
---
You gtg, or still need help?
---
Add me DefWon. Usually on weekends, Friday and Saturday night.
---
This is the second most dangerous venn diagram I've seen this week.  
---
HI everyone,  I encountered Mr. Squeeze last night at a fork in the road that leads up to the Abandoned Waste dump.  He was also accompanied by a high level  mutant Warlord by himself for some reason?
---
I think he is shared by the nearest vendor because this location is just across the river from the vendor at Harpers Ferry.  I noticed that when I had relieved him of all his caps that the bot at Harpers had zero when I visited him at my usual time.  My base is very close to Harpers so I was surprised... I might be wrong but it was just too much of a coincidence that my usual start vendor for my 24hr trading run was empty after I used this guy.  So maybe he pops up anywhere but his bank is linked to the nearest vendor?  I've hopped servers several times and haven't seen him since.
---
It‚Äôs a trap
---
This has been happening for a long time. Super Mutants are legendary cowards. If you're just now noticing it means you've got your character has been baked to perfection, they fear what they know will kill them :)
---
i heard shelf displays were coming with vending
---
Depends on the platform. PC does not have the issue that Xbox and PlayStation has. All one has to do is go to the market97 sub and see the price differences between console and pc to see who‚Äôs still active in duping. 
---
Nice essay, pass English yet? 
---
Every game has its problems and they get fixed
---
Been playing since release and have had a solid 4 glitches that weren't even game breaking
---
Have you even played the game?
---
Or are you just hating on it just because it's "cool" and "trendy" to hate on it? 
---
Let me guess, your subbed to r/GamingCircleJerk unironically
---
I‚Äôm fully aware of that and have literally dozens of total trash knuckles, rolling pins, golf clubs, etc. that I‚Äôll be trading in.  
---
Given the overwhelming positive reception and it feels nice to help people I‚Äôm still going to give decent ones away to Vault dwellers in need.
---
No because it‚Äôs a higher level area. 
---
How much do you want for the ghoul slayers gamma gun?
---
Cool, what level are you?
---
My post isn't about the dupers either? The majority of people WITH duped weapons will be in FO76 subreddits...which is why you see so many people acting like duped weapons isn't such a big deal.
---
Yeah. No doubt. 
---
I dont know about you, but i have been getting quite a good amount of two shots and explosive weapons along with assassins/sentinels/unyielding armors. And my main weapons are Assassins/AA/executioners prefix. So to me, its always been the opposite, i always get them ts/ E weapons when that's not what im been wanting, you would probably assume im a duper if you see my mule's stash. No i dont have more than one of the same exact weapons  but most of them start with the two shot prefix and i have a lot of them. 
---
Though i do agree that finding a TS combined with the explosive effect is quite rare, out of over 100+ TS drops i have gotten i only found a few TSE's , and this was from a few patches ago, nowadays can't seem to have it drop anymore. 
---
51
---
Is still the case as far as I'm aware.
---
Absolutely.  
---
Depending how you play.
---
What‚Äôs the significance of 130?
---
Absolutely. Just gotta do the right things. Go where the xp is. 
---
I try to avoid the general run of the mill scorchbeast as yeah you don't generally get much. I've heard some people say they get good gear sometimes. I had a lvl80 SB attack me at Whitesprings station and I tried to get away but it would not leave me alone so I fought it and brought it down. This one gave me an Ultracite Gatling Laser which was good as I was looking for the plans for this weapon. So you can be lucky sometimes. I use it in SBQ events.
---
Well sure, just use a lot of radaway, I take rad x diluted as well( to protect against rads and keep my mutations viable) I however run the x01 for other damadge protection. I always make sure to have at least 20 radaway, but im also level 99, I didnt start exploring nuke zones till about level 60 tho.
---
I'd say yes, at least one level a day if not more is definitely achievable
---
Hey if you're on PS4 I could help you and I need to do the same thing for my alt PSN Thumper4739
---
My brother from another mother. It's so wonderful isn't it.
---
The excavator power armor is actually good? Because i saw a lot of people above lvl 100 running with it
---
I reinstalled the game a day ago, last time i played was back with the 600stash and even there i still had inventory space since all my armour has low durability im allways repairing it
---
:)
---
I can‚Äôt tell you how much this made me laugh
---
Only way you could keep on top of your rads would be to either use rad-x or radshield and also the rad resistant perk card.
---
What I really miss was the endless hoarding in storage containers for crafting purposes that had no cap. 
---
Thanks :) 
---
The vault was drained of oxygen. We can‚Äôt go back in! 
---
No problem :)
---
pvp should never be the focus of balancing ever
---
Course my game crashed with 2 mins left
---
I would suggest committing to a specific build and adjusting your perk cards accordingly. Being a jack of all trades is going to make things difficult for you IMO.  If you have a good build you can chew through a silo pretty easily solo. I run bloodied meele and can easily run a silo by myself. I cary 2 axes on me because I like to have them as close to 200% as possible... And use anywhere from 0-10 stimpaks I'd say. :/ Never really counted. 
---
Eh, don't feel bad. :) 
---
I had only received 1 upvote [on my version](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b60j0h/account_transfer_banks/ejiqmyb/?context=3) of this idea, which had also included the elaborate in-game Mail system I mentioned.
---
Yes it IS the best for radiation, but lacks in the others, the best balanced is x01
---
T60, you can repair it so cheaply, no springs, no screws, just some steel and plastic
---
You think that's an essay? I've gotten into debates which were massive. If you think what I wrote is an essay, I truly don't know what to say to you. [https://www.debate.org/debates/Macro-evoluton-is-valid/1/](https://www.debate.org/debates/Macro-evoluton-is-valid/1/) &lt;--- That is an essay.
---
You can't fix 76's issues. Some of them are woven into the game itself. No story-line (no, I don't count holotapes as "story-line," no human NPC's, PVP which doesn't even make sense from a story-line perspective, asset flips, copy and pasted code from previous games. You think all of that shit can be fixed?
---
Yeah, I played the game. I like how every one of your stupid cunts who defend 76 instantly accuse your oppositionist of not playing the game. You have the brain the size of a walnut. You're such a fanboy that you can't fathom that someone who played a shit game, thinks it was trash.
---
it would be awesome if you could upgrade the ultracite PA with scorchbeast scales and bones 
---
Aim for he legs and use explosives
---
Cargobot Graveyard?
---
So i can complete the game with only the excavator pw? 
---
Theres an perk in endurance called 'Adamantium skeleton' this should reduce the chance of you getting staggered  
---
Yea actually, it's pretty simple to fix you absolute mong
---
Add NPCs, 
---
Done
---
You happy? 
---
Honestly they should add a bank like Everquest had where you had like 4 shared slots so all your characters on one account could trade items between them, I doubt its that difficult to do. If they're worried about lore, then why not just let you build like a shared box so your characters can trade? Im sure alot of people would appreciate the saving of time doing all of the weird trading
---
It's ABSOLUTELY still around, as of 3 days ago, when he finally showed up and sold me my Hunter's Longcoat finally.
---
Thankfully, his death doesn't close out the trade window and our transaction still completed.
---
Throw me a number. I'm generous.
---
It happens when I run an Unyielding armor set, maybe I AM STRONGEST...?
---
That‚Äôs awesome. I can‚Äôt wait to read your conclusions!
---
Well he said he was server swapping to find lower lvl areas...
---
I sent a friend request I'll help you out if you still need it
---
Some people think is near camp McClintock
---
I've solo'd the silos a few times primarily using all rise - so I never had to worry about ammo. You can definitely do the whole thing with a melee weapon if you run out of ammo but I usually bring a back-up melee weapon just in case it breaks - there is more than enough junk and crafting stations to keep your gear in working order though. Sorry that's not a lot of numbers but hope that helps. Honestly it wasn't as bad as I expected though - I was around level 50 the first time I did it.
---
If they all popped up breifly like the parade did I bet people would do them far more often
---
Would you take 750?  I‚Äôm imagining healing the glowing ones as my friend tries to snipe them as a great prank
---
Thanks for the tip. Oxhorn is cool
---
I just tried coming back to this game and I can‚Äôt even walk in a building without my shit freezing up and booting me. 
---
Absolutely
---
I can craft you one for free if you have the mats.
---
Then how come the enemies are my level when other players haven't been in the area recently? 
---
If that fast travel point could also take you right into the building that'd be sweet.
---
Our colloquial term for the area above Point Pleasant, where the cargobots circle off the map out of range. 
---
Umm the X-01, T-60, and Ultracite all have better rad resistance than the excavator. The reason people use the excavator is for the carry weight. 
---
I believe it's west of vault 76, on the way to the Tyler county dirt track. It's a marked location
---
Server GOP at watoga. There are 4 power armor spawns I believe. 3 I'm sure about. They spawn either 45 or 51s
---
I will keep looking then
---
I had a lvl 68 legendary glowing Yao gui running from me all around Whitesprings earlier. When I finally cor ered him and killed him, I got a Stalkers Golf Club. 
---
Oh good. 100% chance to hit in VATS when you sneak up to within a golf clubs range. That will be real helpful. 
---
The server kept stuttering smh we got her down right in time
---
The enemies scale to the level of the area. They don‚Äôt scale to your level. If higher level players are in the area they will scale to a certain limit for the area. 
---
Ok, I didn't know that. I'll look
---
__*The greater good*__
---
I freeze every sbq fight lol
---
Well, i would aquire t51b as well, its the best ballistic and energy armor there is. Use the excavator for high radiation zones, or the x01, and use t51b for non radiated zones, I currently run t51b and use the x01 for radiation. But i suppose its possible to only use the excavator.
---
You're good, it happens to all of us sometimes
---
I have a lvl45 bloodied one. I honestly don't like it as my favorite gun, but I can't find another use for 556 ammo
---
Oh ok, all I saw was you can set prices and hwat it sells
---
Like the plane location and the space station
---
Agreed. It would be awesome to drop you off in the shopping area.
---
Yes please!
---
Okay, you're really not understanding this. 
---
The enemies are normally my level.
---
But players kept running through that area which made the mobs scale up therefore they are too high of a level for me to kill. 
---
It isnt that hard. 
---
If you have a friend all you need to do is share level 1 rad sponge perk and stay close enough together and you won‚Äôt have to worry about rads at all
---
Hey I know a guy who sells them for 200 caps I can get you in touch 
---
Bouncer-Wolf is my psn by the way i forgot to include it in the original comment
---
agreed!
---
Over farmed... server hopping... good luck trying to get them, I see the same players a lot.
---
Indeed, they are quite important for most places that have super Mutants as well since they are bullet sponges without them. 
---
Ill do 750, I hope it still does what it used to
---
Every heard of the fact that I wasn't standing on anything? The more you know...
---
Me too. Xbox.
---
I don't need to antagonize you, you're completely ready to bitch and cry all by yourself. Mind you, I wasn't talking just about the original post, but other comments on here as well.
---
OK, if what you say is true and you actually have a decent set of equips but you choose to use a weaker weapon based on aesthetics then that's on you. You're not trying to do anyone a favor by suggesting  to the developers that they should strip the player's equips, you're crying because you believe too many people have a rare item that either you don't have or you think it only make sense if you and a few others have ownership of rare items.
---
Millions of people are playing Fallout 76, it's not unthinkable that you're going to start seeing a lot of people get the end game gear, getting that gear isn't that difficult when you have open trade between the players. 
---
Now, since you spent far too long bitching about the current state, and next to zero effort in addressing a solution, let me point out where this conversation would go: Trade regulation or nix'ing trade all together. You may not be for that, and neither is the majority of the FO76 community, but that's where these kind of complaints of "other players having equipment that I don't think they deserve" will head to. 
---
It was a dumb proposal to suggest that the developers take away rare items because they might of been obtained illegitimately. They aren't going anywhere, and to be honest they aren't that big of a deal. Most of the duped equips are slowly being depleted from the market anyways.  There are two choices Bethesda has here to solve the problem of future duped weapons; a) nix trade b) improve game integrity. Personally, ill put up with a few dupes to keep player trade, as it looks like they have already  improved the game integrity to where the majority of dupe exploits are gone.  
---
All that needs to happen here is Bethesda needs to stay the course, continue to fix future dupe exploits, and keep trade as open as possible. The existing duped weapons will eventually become obsolete by newer weapons that are higher level or have more stars. Stripping all of the duped equips from players will just piss a lot of people off for damn near nothing in return. This is obviously why Bethesda choose not to go down that route.
---
In the lobby would be perfect.  And no pvp inside
---
i know most of the prime reciever plans and can mod something for free if you'd like, i have the flux and also i have a exploding prime stalkers pump shotgun i can give you because you came to help. Just let me know.
---
Sounds good.  My GT is BenevolentDM and I should be off work and heading home in about an hour or so
---
Good thing we finish it in the end.
---
Way to run all this! What is your guys faction name. Like the brotherhood of Steel but less military 
---
it appears you are correct, its the best for his level tho. 
---
Here is the thing... you factually do motnlse things in your stash from dying. Period. 
---
I farm leader of the pack regularly for low level legendary gear. Please don‚Äôt scale with my level, some of us want to farm low and mid level gear on purpose. Areas typically determine level.

You could probably get 300 damage or near if you max rifleman, adrenal, nerd rage, bloody mess. I use 556 as emergency noob ammo if they are out.
---
That‚Äôs a bit much.  People would be server hopping to farm it constantly for low level gear.  For the level, 3 star gear is too much.
---
How much for the 3* 10mm machine gun?
---
Thanks for the decorations! my camp needed some color its awesome!
---
Back ordered on the Bethesda online store :(
---
Moving around is one thing, but if you are a Legendary creature, you shouldn't take off like a race horse through the fucking forest after one whack or shot. My god, the radroaches have more balls.
---
Ok, whiner
---
Ill be offline in 2 hours. Just message my GT, same as my reddit name.
---
I‚Äôm alright thanks though, just hate to get a crash after expending 3k+ ammo lol
---
Sounds good, will do
---
or the drill
---
Goddamn Freys
---
No, it's not that simple. Story-lines are interwoven with NPC's. 76 would have to be re-made from the ground up so that a decent job can be done with human NPC's - fleshing out the world with human NPC's means nothing if the NPC's do nothing to add to the story-line.
---
There's a reason why I said no story-line and no human npc's (amongst other points) are major flaws with the game. You want to talk about the issues one at a time, fine. But don't pretend that taking points one at a time means that the other points I've mentioned are separate issues. They're not.
---
So what are your special stats? I have a hard time getting the right blend for damage and damage resistance
---
15 is max.
---
I'll give it a shot, thanks for the tip!
---
Kinda embarrassing to be honest. 
---
Sometimes the test bugs out.  If you server hop you can try again (usually changes the booze too though).
---
For things like Pickaxe Lager, and other existing brews, it's better to just find one to drink than craft them, as sometimes the ingredients are annoying (like strangler bloom).
---
Had a 3 star legendary assaultron attack me in a nuke silo. The one time I didn't want to run into a legendary 3 star enemy.
---
But I have noticed some legendary mutants running away. Almost feel bad about killing them.
---
im still somewhat salty that they nerfed TSE but the bullet sponges stayed the same
---
Bugged. I think it has to do with discovering a place through fast traveling to a friend. The only way to fix it that I know of is discovering the location with a different character.
---
You can pass but you have to marry one of my daughters.
---
What the fuck are you on about PvP not making sense in the storyline?
---
That‚Äôs why I build my camp on the golf course. People Bitch but I don‚Äôt care
---
If you look at people's armor that is Assasin's sentinel, with the exception of those rare people who farmed or traded for each piece, they are all the exact same as the ones for sale on ebay and elsewhere. I don't know how many assasin sentinel full armor sets were duped but it must have been quite a lot and at 50 or more bucks a pop someone made bank off duping. 
---
No I understand it fine. I‚Äôm telling you that every region of the map has a certain limit enemies will scale to. The forest is 1-15 for example. Now, the area you were in could have been 25-68. I‚Äôll have to check in my guide later. But if you cannot kill a 68 you shouldn‚Äôt be there! Sure you can server hop a bunch, but that‚Äôs your own fault. So don‚Äôt come on reddit and cry. It isn‚Äôt that hard. 
---
Do I at least get to see the daughters beforehand, or is it just a crapshoot
---
Do you always jump to conclusions or read between the lines in your daily life too?
---
We won't give up those weapons because a) We grinded for them and b) Because most enemies are bullet sponges without them. Giving them up "for the greater good of the game" is kinda like saying that we should give up our cars that a) we worked for and b) are necessary for going to work properly "for the greater good of the planet", it might be something that everyone would like in an ideal work, but it still ain't gonna happen anytime soon without riots. 
---
Been server hopping for three days - the quest never changes.
---
Is any sneak attack supposed to work?
---
Ive found the fastest way to get them is to message anyone over level 150 and ask if they have any foe sale, I got everything i needed in about 2 hours. If theres nobody, jump servors and continue.
---
I did not know this, I thought I was saving space by getting rid of my extra frames.  Now I got to go pick some up.  
---
How can you go from a sniper/stealth build to a melee build on a whim?
---
Wish I was on to utilize that. Appreciate you spreading where they are tho. 
---
Do you always whine about trivial things on games?
---
Sure! PM the info
---
funny that. was scrolling through here to find someone holding him on pc
---
Any sneak attack is supposed to work.  I just did my daily 10 minutes ago.  Drink Rum, Land Sneak Attack.
---
You are not wrong there, but at least you can still one shot them with bloodied builds I suppose. 
---
No problem.
---
That's what a shit bucket is for!
---
We had a Brotherhood of Steel name at one point, but I can‚Äôt remember it right now. We‚Äôre thinking of Stormlords and Stormladies, because we‚Äôre apparently responsible for all the radiation storms in Fallout 4, and I can‚Äôt disagree. 
---
I have played many different releases, but they are all fuzzy. Thank you for the correction:). I thought fo2 had the 13 year timer, silly me :)
---
And so it begins, the fall to neck-bearddom. Beware the piss jugs.
---
TODAY I FOUND THE X-01 JETPACK AND I REJOICED
---
Love it
---
Broken mechanic in a game is trivial? I guess one thing we do know, is that you certainly like settling for less in your life...
---
Postapocalyptic Zen
---
You may have stumbled onto the pre-quest for Nuclear Winter. New Silos are found and all nukes need to be launched within a relatively short time period to close all the fissures, which causes a nuclear winter.
---
Either way, well done sirs and madams, well done.
---
Hahaha dying
---
Okay, but here is the thing. I completed the quest just fine last night so it is absolutely the player scaling that is fucking me over right now.
---
The area I was in is level 15 to 99 (savage divide). I was level 17 so theoretically I should be find there presuming there are no other players in the area but White Springs is a hot spot for players so enemies will usually be scaled up. This is an issue with how the game determines the mob levels. The work around is for me to go quest elsewhere which is fine but I wish there was a different way. 
---
Next time you decide to be an asshole on Reddit, at least make sure you're right about what you're talking about :) 
---
You obviously don't know who your talking to. Maybe you ought to look at his threads before you respond.
---
Point is that those duped weapons are still pretty much a necessity in this game, otherwise most enemies remain essentially bullet sponges.
---
Plus Bethesda didn't add any way to track duped items in this game, so they really wouldn't be able to delete them without deleting legit items as well (And essentially deleting every weapon that has the TSE/AAE on them, which would be obviously moronic). 
---
There was a few, not as much as we would have liked. The sheer amount of level 68 heavys kinda made up for it though. Xp was flowing like water out of a tap, as were junk guns to break down.
---
Oh alright, thanks for the tip!
---
Thank you.
---
i'm so glad i found this out by accident ! though it was known, am still happy to save 200 space in my stash box.
---
i love having a suit of each armor, i hope we get power armor display stands in the near future !
---
The Blackwater Mine is located In the Savage Divide...not a low level area anyways no matter if you are server hopping. 
---
You can still do the quest, I got the recipe from it, it's just that the "buff" doesn't seem to work, at least not with the Gatling Plasma
---
Poop. World full
---
Best advice. Just saw one there.
---
Its not. Uranium fever gives 3 chances at 3-star legendaries. Every horde event (except this one) has a guaranteed 3-star at the end. None of them are guaranteed to give amazing items (as we all well know). People are already hopping for these events that give better items, why would people hopping for low level stuff be a concern?
---
I just hit 130 from Dec. 25th
---
I have 100, none from the roof.
---
Will be here awhile üëç
---
what platform you on? If you're on PC I can give you a couple of Fasnacht masks, you missed that event. Coming up soon: legendary vendor! Also, no more slap damage on the adventure servers. Keep pacifist on and you're totally safe outside of workshops. 
---
Energy weapons last longer now, cryolaters and plasma gatling guns etc last much much longer now. So instead of carrying 4 cryolaters to use against the SBQ I only need to carry 2.
---
You can log out and come back and he'll have different stuff
---
 Why we are on the subject, lets just pull up some receipts shall we...
---
"Everyone should have push to talk
---
Shame on you if you don't
---
Everyone should have a mic
---
They are 5 bucks at a wall mart
---
If you are socially awkward I get it, but don't follow me or ask to trade or team up
---
No mic, no team play"
---
 "The person that does the voice over, should have their fucking voice box removed.
---
Most cringe voice I've ever heard."
---
Oooof, aged well huh? Take your own advice... 
---
I'm lucky if the game doesn't crash.
---
I took part in one earlier...
---
I will add you in a few minutes. Thank you for this so much.
---
Who the heck needs 200 stims at any given moment lol. I never have more then 30 and always dilute. Every 10 is 40 diluted. 
---
I know but can I take off a ability‚Äôs and upgrade another one
---
Hey kid, no one cares
---
Leave then in the oversee camp stash. 
---
Off a team in order: 37, 23, 6, 17, 18, 30, 22. Are my specials. My armor is 295physical, 25poison, 376energy, 10rad
---
No they aren't.
---
I've been doing just fine with a legit sniper rifle...its not even a legendary.
---
Nuclear winter is coming...
---
No prob, happy hunting. Btw i never paid over 300 caps each, lowest i found was 150.
---
I usually don't either because I have hated that perk since 3. I hate corpses exploding randomly and having to check all the parts to make sure I got all the loot. Also I usually don't have room for it.
---
Glorious indeed! I'm sorry I missed it!
---
\*raises volume "EXTERMINATE" 
---
Yea, my main serum guy has em for 250 caps but he‚Äôs busy. 
---
I thought willing to pay 300 would get more people to reply and sell but apparently not 
---
I think Bethesda couldn't find a solution to trace back the original items and the owners rightfully to possess them. So instead of punishing innocents whom have legitimately bought them with caps or have just found them lying on the ground somehow, they restricted their amount and went, since these items are now common and defines the meta, to a nerf and to plans to make them cheaper: the legendary vendor.
---
So I wouldn't expect Bethesda to go through a wipe of these items, but rather to make anybody the oppurtinity to craft them via this new vendor.
---
What I would like though is some buffs to the other useless effects, and new ones if possible.
---
Ahh cool! I‚Äôll have to try and get him to spawn
---
Its actually super easy to get kills even without legendary effects. Pvp is a super broken, but most weapons are gonna melt anyone not using a sentinel assassins armor and standing still.
---
If no one takes that oil off your hands by the time i can get on, I'll take it. (Either late tonight or tomorrow)
---
Well, you obviously do. If you didn't think it was anything worth discussing, you wouldn't have chimed in. Take your L and Leave.
---
No.
---
It'll be helpful if you can hack the terminals and remove targeting restrictions from the turrets.  They do a fantastic job of keeping the robots busy while you pick them off.  All Rise is a good anti-robot tool in my opinion.  Save crits for Combat Inhibitors on Assaultrons if you have the perk to chose limbs in VATS.  I think when I did my solo run at 70-ish, I carried in 50 diluted stimpaks, used them early, and in power armor since the armor doesn't have a stimpak animation.
---
thanks for your work on the survioval damage. It still confounds me that they chose to do it this way but ::shrug:: I will work with what is given. At least I can play spoiler by one shotting lvl 60 players at lvl 12 with my shotgun.
---
Hey sorry for the late reply I spend most of my day at work. Im well aware that he could have kept killing me after I was killed once, but he did not claim the workshop so I figured I could at least go back and pickup all my fusion cores, acid and wood from the generators. I also thought maybe he might be using exploits because I diden't expect him to kill me so quickly (im lvl 112 with a full set of X-01 and I had full health) so I when't back primarily to record his name and report him for greifing (because he killed me multiple times without claiming the workshop) and maybe for using exploits if he seemed to be cheating. Thanks for your questions I definitely could have given more details.
---
I'd like to see craft able cryptid gear as well.
---
You get different materials from each cryptid.
---
It would only make sense. 
---
It's obvious you haven't reached a certain level where enemies like Super Mutants and in particular the SBQ are clearly bullet sponges then, otherwise you wouldn't be saying that.
---
Either that or you didn't notice how many people were actually shooting the SBQ with TSE/AAE/BE weapons during your runs, otherwise it would take everyone double to triple the amount of ammo to kill her, which would pretty much deter anyone from farming her in the first place. 
---
Out of 102 attempts to spawn a random encounter with someone's camp there, I can report \*08 time sthat it's happened.  
---
Camps are, according to everything I've seen,  blockers.
---
Thats awesome
---
Well no that's not true at all...setup your camp right of whitespring&gt; go to golf house and loot everything - junk then go to whitespring main building and sell it for 200 caps, then loot all the vases and hangers, slowly walk to the bunker and sell everything for 200 caps, then loot tehnical data in military toom and go deposit them. 3 - harpers farry - kill the town and loot weapons only then sell them tere and you should have enaugh to go to watoga and then watoga trainstation and max sell everything. Is hard bargin perk worth it? yes but only at 1 star as it will make puriffied water sell for 3 instead of 2. Now you only have trainstation and raider left. I usually go to luisberg and to the most south one close by and I cover it with what I find in lusiberg. There is also a cap stash on top of the bunker back entrance.
---
Setup - you can farm all plants from a nuke zone - they sell for 1 but you need to logout and not play untill the vendor reset at 20 hours, you can find clothes that weigh 0.1 and sell for about 10-30 caps, best would be the asylum - go there and loot the straight jackets - about 6-7 per 5 mins, they sell for 30 with hardbargin 1 star. Long story short you will have so much caps you won't know  what to do with them.
---
So buy serum or mutations? no youtube how to get mutations and see how to get all for free by iradiating yourself and then washing and where, there is almost nothing worth buying in stores past that, so your endgame at 25k hard cap caps is quite easy to get - for the ultimate weapons that is. I use a fireaxe and 2-3 shot kill anything, with excavator armor can carry about 400 total - get full armor and calibrated shocks on each leg, you will give xo1 up with the jetpack once you play this way
---
Oh so when you you said that they were necessary because most enemies in game are bullet sponges....you really meant just the enemies in the single, individual, end game event.
---
Obviously a regular non-legendart won't cut it for SBQ. But I know I don't need a duped item for it either.
---
You're god damn right I did.
---
Make a mule. Most expedient way to "bank" caps right now. 
---
Never knew about that. Guess I'll move.
---
I don't think anyone cares about building on the course as long as its not a turret base overlooking the golf club. I love golf course trading CAMPs. Just not good club turret CAMPs
---
Thank you!
---
Same here. 
---
I think it will be 100% human NPC with dialogue choices like in fallout 4. 
---
It happens! There's a random spawn over by the Overseers camp that I didn't know about until recently, and I had my camp built there for the concrete
---
All good! I wonder if they started claiming it to engage the pvp and then stepped out of the circle. I‚Äôve accidentally done that before myself but didn‚Äôt have pvp going on to test the hostility. I‚Äôll bet that it doesn‚Äôt drop when you leave the circle. They would have had to spend the caps to start the claim, though that doesn‚Äôt make dying any less frustrating. 
---
Still have vendor?
---
Wait dont replace me!! I can get shot by people and get yeet yeeted!!
---
I needed a spot near a train station to offload unneeded junk for caps.
---
You should be able to
---
I've found heavy guns with one man army being one of the few relatively reliable ways to stagger a sentinel. But even then, hope that you'll not get melted before you can stagger. Explosive seems to help the procs.
---
Ooo drugs
---
Yes.  
---
It‚Äôs nice since they put in the thing that shows the turret owner and you can see if they are a struggling low level or a cheapskate er.., minimalistic high level.
---
You can build by other random train stations, the other ones don't have a random encounter spawn area so you'd be fine anywhere else! I just don't recommend Whitespring station cause of the occasional nuke haha
---
I don‚Äôt understand what took so long to fix this. Like did they try and fix it early on and mess everything up?
---
Interesting, gonna test that. Have you used event FT at any point prior to occurrence? 
---
&gt;Check out the greenbrier!!! Oh and if possible the real life fasnacht parade in Helvetia.
---
Fasnacht was the first week of March. It's over, sadly.
---
Me? Hahahahahaha. 
---
Sadly I can‚Äôt and I now can‚Äôt upgrade stuff like science and and home defense and explosives
---
Yo do you still have it?
---
What‚Äôs that about? Just scarcity of repair bits or something?
---
ikr this was hilarious 
---
Gauss would be better, if you have an ungodly aim.  It has better per shot damage.  If you need to get some rounds out to hit them, take the combat rifle.
---
Far as I know, Bethesda is trying to reduce the amount of caps in the world(s) at the moment. So doubtful they will do this.
---
You really just confirmed what I said. The enemies scale towards players within their region limits. Level 17 in the savage divide solo? Yeah you deserve what you get. The game wasn‚Äôt made to fly though in 30 levels. 
---
Bethesda stated multiple times that character visuals should not be forced by math in their game. Also the DRs are way less usefull than the effects.
---
Hey sorry, its sold already
---
shhhhhhh. dont tell him that.
---
Today was my second purchase. I'm just wondering if it's been made more available. 
---
If you have the right HP then yes. It will have more damage but you need to be low health. Depends if you wanna go that route. 
---
Lol. My Sneak commando kills in half a second. People get so angry, but I wouldn‚Äôt have figured out this stuff if I didn‚Äôt do the tests.
---
Maybe he meant "all of our major studios are coming together to FIX the project". 
---
I won't lie I use this method to silently judge the quality of your camp.  If it looks like a 12 year olds tree house and you are 50+ I die a little inside.
---
Awfully bright out today, honey.
---
Oh no, dear, another nuke just went off on our front lawn.
---
Need to get through Whitesprings for the Mistress of Mystery questline, but I keep getting slaughtered. When there are high-level players nearby, they also let me die and loot my scrap rather than rescue me. And I'm still disappointed Toilet Paper isn't one of the most valuable items in the game.
---
Someone killed it
---
&gt; just the enemies in the single, individual, end game event. 
---
You are downplaying the event that takes 80% of the time of end game players there, and I bet the bullet sponginess won't get much better when they finally introduce raids in this game. 
---
Plus, realistically, you really need something that has at least an Explosive effect in it, and the added damage of the TS, B and AA effects also help to not make this game require you to craft insufferable amounts of ammo in order to do end game events. So, at the end of the day, we don't really have much of a choice, do we? 
---
What‚Äôs your gamertag?
---
In the next major game-overhaul DLC, TSE and other God Tier weapons will be obsolete. BGS probably had meetings devoted to the question: "Do we yank all the duped items and ban the dupers? Or do we ban all the dupers and leave the items to prevent a backlash as they'll be obsolete in a few months anyway."
---
I'm guessing  there was a good number of people who bought those, dumping their caps, without comprehending the duping factor in its totality.
---
Did I miss it??
---
One vats crit to the head might do the trick. My alt whom I'm now exping has a TSE pipe bolt action rifle that maaaaybe might do the trick
---
If you like to have high health then no. I would just sell it and move on personally. 
---
I still think it's Bethesda Austin's fault. The more I learn about them and their previous project "Battlecry" the more I can't help but wonder why they were handed a project like this. 
---
Ha, same thing to me today. Been looking for a right leg for T60 for a few days. Got one tonight and started to use the tricentinal paid and seen the woodland.
---
Davolicious.
---
Yeah, I spawned in my camp at bottom of savage divide and went to watoga via ft
---
Wasn't me. Someone shot the pack brahmin too. 
---
Whomst the fuck is biv 
---
I wonder what it is about dupes that makes it so hard to track them down in small quanitities 
---
While you are here, I thought it would be a good idea and try to turn this unfortunate interaction that took place and turn it into something good, so I found you a book to read, I truly think it will help resolves some issues you have been having. Let me know how it works out for you.
---
https://www.inspiringlifedreams.com/practice-what-you-preach-parents/
---
No, this is the place where people absolutely hate duped weapons.
---
Source: my buddy got witch hunted and banned.
---
The only thing I wish to add after my amen to all that is that the majority of the playerbase has some understanding of meta, but there are definitely some great items that have no recognition and their price does not indicate their value.
---
Tbh, that‚Äôs the real level up, when you‚Äôre in a position to lend some other player a hand ;-)
---
Note, you can't do anything with it, as the game doesn't let you pick it up, but it looks a lot like the trailer.
---
It was limited time 
---
Sure, but trust me it won't matter.
---
You just laid out a capitalism vs. communism argument. Well done Fallout 76 roleplay!
---
I‚Äôve been summoned?
---
I gotchu, just won t be on for at least another hour so idk if it'll work out
---
Not sure what you mean. Did I miss something?
---
I remember seeing it somewhere near where the forest wraps around the upper end of the map on the left.
---
But i feel like the higher level i am the more junk i'll have
---
I am having a similar issue with the "Drink Bourbon, score a Critical" quest.  Have been stuck for over a week now.  Cannot get a crit to register.  Crit meter fills, but never goes off.
---
I‚Äôve got a 3* - when I get online I‚Äôll tell you the perks. How much are you wanting to spend?
---
They announced it at PAX that a new feature coming soon will be camps persisting after someone logs out. Not quit sure what they mean by that or how it will even work but that idea worries me.
---
I finally got an x01 jet pack yesterday after visiting the bunker daily since beta
---
Yeah. Just another reason why I'm not touching PVP with a 10 foot pole.   
---
See mom? I told you I would finally be good at something!
---
But really, the added part is that unlike the comparison that I did where at least something good would come out of it, literally nothing would happen out of this supposed dupe deletion outside of further annoying people (Low level players would still complain about high level players being OP, so whatever honestly). 
---
Not sure, was kinda looking for two levels 1s for me and my boy. Depending on how much you are willing to sell it for
---
My issue is with people who when I politely let know that they are blocking a vendor spawn by messaging them with "just a heads up, your base is blocking a special vendor spawn...", are dicks about it. One guy's response was "the vendor isn't that special". Well, neither was his camp.
---
Yeah.... about that...
---
I put it in a spot that doesn‚Äôt have any spawns but there are turrets. They‚Äôre mostly there to keep my stuff from getting broken by crap like radrats.
---
Huh... I watched the livestream, but I must have missed that part. I'll rewatch it, but yeah, that seems... confusing and problematic.
---
I would like to know why you feel these granular controls would be necessary? I get that you want them, just not sure I understand why.
---
Before he answers, I‚Äôm gonna guess he took the generally agreed upon lvl 65 milestone for a fully build-capable character and wants to double it. I wonder if that‚Äôs it
---
Roger, I know exactly where you are talking about. I thought maybe there was another location I haven't yet disvovered.
---
When I first saw the carbobots flying a racetrack I assumed it was a holding pattern for them until they are summoned in-game; by having them 'live' that the memory required is already allocated.
---
The power armor might of been the winterized armor. It exists in the dev room.
---
They obviously did what they did to allow for parity of players no matter the level. It's an ok solution to the problem of high lvls picking on low lvls. I think most people just think in terms of the pve mechanics and are there for jumping to the same pve conclusions.
---
Yesss
---
There was a system for the ancients who played EverQuest and body functions. It was known as "the poop sock". I'll let you figure out how it worked.
---
Yep, and I have 101.
---
Or a Scorchbeast wing cape. Something that says "Who's the apex predator of Appalachia *now*?"
---
I would say TSE combat rifle.
---
Lmao lame 
---
I'm pretty sure that when that happens... which I'm understanding is just something that is currently on the "this would be cool" list at Bethesda... all of those other kinks will have been worked out. 
---
I'm imagining it to be something like "player housing" in other games... but it does raise some questions... about servers, and other players being able to damage Camps... I'm guessing all of that will be addressed prior to the actual implementation. 
---
I agree that event rewards could be improved quite a bit. On the other hand, fast travel costs are insignificant, even if you don't use the perk. Especially when server hopping is destabilizing for *any* games' servers.
---
I have a soft spot for excavator just because it felt so satisfying to craft a set at low level. Nice job on the art!
---
This game can be a disaster sometimes, but I appreciate the community engagement, even if it ended without any crazy discoveries.
---
It's already there, you can see notifications in the top left corner about radio signals. If you tune to this signal you will hear about event. It's probably not for all events though.
---
üëç
---
But did he die?
---
In the early days of it, it was made at such low quality that it did make you hallucinate due to it poisoning you.
---
Spawns near the overseers camp, just down the road past the truck. There is another random spawn point north of the R&amp;G station too. Seen him at both.
---
It does, it‚Äôs just that critical shots are much more reliable in achieving in this goal.
---
There‚Äôs a few ways on slicing the sentinel onion, But in practice, one gun army doesn‚Äôt compare to stealth crits, (expecially in the game where everyone sneaks all the time)
---
‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Thanks!  At first when I crafted it I was taken aback by all the yellow, but warmed up to it after using it all the time for that sweet sweet +carryweight.  
---
PS4, my bad
---
Seriously, look at my post history.
---
I've noticed there movements seem to be really clunky. They t pose alot and they dont seem to be able to bend their elbows or hold a rifle properly. Ive never seen one do anything beyond hip fire any weapon. What bothers me is that scorched beast a primary focus of the game. It makes me think they ran into this issue early on in development and actually built the game around it. That would mean this game at its core is just a bandaid with hundreds of bandaids wrapped around it. I was hoping someone with some code experience might ve able to shed more light on this. 
---
Like I mean has anyone found it right now? I‚Äôve been server hopping that location for about 2 hours
---
Everyone watch Many A True Nerd‚Äôs Fallout 76 video. This really reminds me of it.
---
How satisfying is attaching that mod?!
---
I had this problem, too. My solution required me to power cycle my Xbox (hold power button until shutdown) and remove power cord for 10 seconds. It worked perfectly thereafter.
---
Sorry, I just figured 100 is a nice, round number...
---
Very much so
---
I would even be fine with trading free Vault 76 travel for whitesprings.
---
I‚Äôve got almost 300
---
Do you have any technical data on you?
---
First time it took me 45 jumps,  second time about 30
---
You can crouch and it prevents vats. If you stealth and move very cautiously you won't pop up on the compass either
---
It depends. If I‚Äôve got cover, or one of those AA guns, yes. If I happen to have my Dragon with me, also yes. They can drop rare plans and while probably aren‚Äôt +EV in terms of your junk economy, they can‚Äôt be far from 1.
---
I hope so cuz out of everything they said this is the most confusing and worrisome in my opinion
---
I think the will do it like Fortnite does. Community events and lasting map changes over seasons.
---
I would climb on board that train! :)
---
Yes, a few times. I had to revive him 
---
If you're still on I'd love some serums. If not tonight I can always try during the week whenever you're free.
---
This is why I don't drink liquids while I play
---
I've seen the robot vendor one time just when I was just beginning to blackout from nukashine and until seeing this I thought it was a hallucination as a result of the shine 
---
Bloodied for weapons and unyielding for armor. Both need low health to work the best so it‚Äôs kind of killing two birds with one stone. Unless you end up in close range combat, then your screwed. 
---
Exactly what im saying. Your forced to crouch forever unless you want to be shot with vats or your hunted down by your "red-dot" on the compass. I have a max sneak build with chameleon and without shooting people, players still manage to track me down with the "red-dot". I'm literally having fights in pvp where im sneaking away from people above or below me on the compass since they know where i am but cant see me on rock ledges. 
---
Eh, as long you didnt abandon him, i dont see the problem.
---
Just put it by the entrance robots. They kick ass
---
Mighty. Glad I held out for an organic jet pack vs buying one. Something about getting that rare thing you want naturally after trying for so long lol
---
Where specifically does the responder bot spawn at near Lady Janet's Soft Serve? 
---
Alright
---
yall need a builder?
---
So you taught him a harsh lesson, that the wasteland is cruel and without mercy. And you taught him another lesson, that the most dangerous are in fact the players. Not the npcs.
---
This happened to me, too. I needed to fully power cycle my Xbox (press power until shutdown) and remove power cord for 10 seconds. Signing out and server hopping did not work, but this did.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs cache related or how long it‚Äôs been since I performed a total shutdown, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure. Hope this works for you, even if you‚Äôre on PC.
---
That's what my brother is for. I just have him watch my character while I go
---
It doesn't spawn every time since it is a random spawn. If you run South down the road and right when you pass the tipped over bus it will spawn in the road
---
When you access your stash box or any stash box on the map in Adventure mode or survival mode you only see your inventory. No one else can see your stash they just see their own stash. So locking the stash box is a pointless task. 
---
Improperly made absinthe can cause hallucinations.
---
Its ok, as long as you didnt do anything to his butt without sober consent. 
---
Thank you third person to say this
---
No worries. Thanks for letting me know. 
---
Secret discovering in the community collaboration sense is what amazing multiplayer games bring! This just might be the first piece of major community interaction that can be cited as bethesda figuring out the multiplayer identity piece for this first try. The game should be bursting with secrets and riddles to solve as the curiosity of the player base simmers in our interaction. 
---
I get what you are saying but VATS is literally a part of our pip boy. Are we all gonna fall and break it?
---
Excavator armor is just ridiculously durable.  In the 50 levels sunce I got it I've only repaired it twice. 
---
I definitely don't crouch everywhere I go. I usually run and keep an eye open until I get in more popular areas or see a dot on my compass, then I crouch. It hasn't caused me many problems so far. I think it's fine the way it is. If it were not then everyone would be shot and killed without ever knowing anyone else was nearby. 
---
Haha thanks for the input but that‚Äôs not what I meant, I‚Äôve played 76 before if I was unclear?? I mean locking it so intruders have a harder time storing junk or aid after adventuring/pvp so you can kill them and take it.
---
They have officially said that, just as slap damage is being removed from adventure mode, camp damage will be removed as well. In that event it would be less troubling, but I'm still confused.
---
stalker :p
---
Have unequipped the card you want to upgrade? Or unequipped a different perk under that special, and then tried upgrading the perk you want? Do you know if you have enough of the certain perk cards to upgrade it?
---
it could be the start, the attunement step to gaining access to higher challenges and deeper rabbit holes of interesting apocalypse lore. x-files-y
---
I wouldn't worry about it... the only concern that I would have is that currently our camps are not invulnerable to attack by players or npc's. I would think that would be addressed beforehand. It seems that's the directly they're going with the removal of slap damage since Survival came out. 
---
As far as servers go, it would be simple to have persistent camps since the server population is so light. But you bring up a good point that we are assigned servers seemingly randomly. I'm curious what the work around will be. 
---
Joining your world now 
---
You just take it out of Survival? If you want some lore behind it sure, vats broke because of some new telecom radio network messing with the internals of the pipboy. 
---
With the right perks/mutations, almost any bloodied weapon can do hundreds of damage.  Very few creatures can take that kind of damage for very long.  You don‚Äôt need duped weapons to do that, just the knowhow on how to utilize the rather broken damage multipliers available in FO.
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/267](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/267)
---
I just dont want to be tied to a specific server. I hop constantly farming for legendary enemies. If your camp ties you to a server you would probably have to pack up your camp to get to a new one and kinda hope your spot is available. Idk how any of this will go but it bothers me
---
There‚Äôs a queue though so not sure how long it‚Äôll take 
---
that is what it is about the most troubled people ending up associated with the gamer group. its not gaming causing troubled, its that we battle pretend monsters to deal with the real ones that populate our daily struggles
---
Show us on the doll
---
You just need fireproof perks and dense mod.  Then it barely does damage. 
---
Bro they severely nerfed them and it‚Äôs not just the explosive but it‚Äôs also the perks. I have a TSE Dragon and it doesn‚Äôt one shot without perks
---
I'm pretty sure that I found it in game. I'm at work right now, but I did take a pic of it. I'll post it when I get home.
---
I argued for a new character requirement for survival mode to legitimize gear and weapons used in PvP, but that idea was soundly beaten down by others.  I think you and I are unfortunately in the minority.  
---
I guess you just have to "git gud".  I still haven't touched survival mode and likely won't ever.
---
Alright no problem. 
---
This issue usually occurs in high player dense area's. Once 10 or so people are in one area, it becomes a compass/vats war more so then actual aim-skill or positioning. 
---
Use fireproof should help quite a bit. But fallout wouldn't be fallout without legendary effects. All have positive and negatives. Just gotta adjust perks to help with what you're facing. Good luck out there.
---
You don't have a choice if you expect to waltz into end game content, sure.
---
Only a small fraction of players do end game content. It is meant to take time.
---
It's not impossible to get legit good weapons. Nothing in the game is impossible to do anything in this game with a non-duped weapon.
---
There is no need for duped weapons to be in the game.
---
Oh now I understand what you are suggesting. That‚Äôs a pretty good idea. Why make an enemies job easier, you want to make his life hell to give you an advantage in killing him.
---
I was mostly being a smart ass. I agree that survival needs balancing in almost every aspect. But I would be very surprised if completely removing VATS was their answer. Maybe they can mess with the hit percentage chance and damage. 
---
It‚Äôs a big mess, really. These are all the same mechanics from a single player game. Of course they don‚Äôt behave well in an online pvp environment. I wouldn‚Äôt want the job of fixing this. 
---
Had that happen to me.  Did melee and ranged sneak attack, but it didn't clear the quest. Someone said it had to be a critical attack, tried that too, but it didn't work.  Next day I logged in and a simple ranged sneak attack worked. (Just like I had tried the previous day)
---
I don‚Äôt know about the R&amp;G location, could you add some more info? How far north of the station? Directly north? Any landmarks useful to find it? Thanks in advance! 
---
I love this idea! 
---
The cargo bot hovering in a circle over point pleasant happened to me. And I have video of it on my ps4
---
ok.  btw, on pc here
---
Ah, yea. At that point you try and get in position then stay still so you don't show up on the compass
---
the witch trick or treater spawns by have church also.
---
got the hat plan but no dress yet
---
Hopefully when survival comes out of "beta" (smh) they will force all interested parties to start new characters. 
---
IF all duping exploits are patched then survival would be free of duped items. 
---
Of course that would just force trolls back into adventure and exploit workshop contesting. 
---
Once again, for those of you who argue against starting all over again, doing so would eliminate duped items from the mode IF the dupe exploits were removed. 
---
Good luck finding dense mods now.
---
For vendors, obviously that would be huge, but they'd have to restrict the locations somewhat as the guy who has the whitesprings lawn is obviously just going to have it sit there indefinitely with a vendor  
---
I think it would be optional like everything else they do and maybe an extra cost? Some of the newbie towns near Vault 76 would be cool to see if I was  a lowbie 
---
Bravo, Soldier. This took a lot of effort, helluva lot more than I would‚Äôve wanted to deal with. Good job.
---
I have two. They spawn at the inner grafton bot and watoga. 
---
I think that reducing the fast travel cost straight to events would be such a great idea! Maybe half the price of what that fast travel would normally be for the player if you‚Äôre fast travelling to an active event marker! Would definitely make the events more populated.
---
Yeah just because it‚Äôs harder to fast travel I figured every workbench and stash is more valuable. But IMO if they do it to the stash it wouldn‚Äôt make a difference if they did it to the benches UNLESS the person is overcucumbered (you read that right) and you‚Äôre taking AP into account for pvp 
---
I think nylon might be better in this instance...
---
It would be fine without exploding on shotguns.
---
We'll see how you fair against my outcast faction, the Sisterhood of Aluminum!
---
Thats the issue though. Anything outside of 20 meter engagements is fine since there is no compass war. The second you get into medium/close quarters fights, its a pure compass war. No thought or anything. You know exactly where your enemy is, above or below you. It kinda ruins Survival for me. You can't hide unless your 20 meters away from everyone. 
---
Dense mods aren‚Äôt that hard to find at all.
---
Dense plans are tough.
---
One of the lesser-known (and used) functions of the Mr. Handy...
---
How about an option when someone is claiming the shop?
---
You can either go fight or concede and let them have the shop,  PVP averted.
---
Same. Just seeing it as available made me do a double-take both times. 
---
That‚Äôs because so far there is no dense plan. Or at least last I checked it wasn‚Äôt on the list. Unless it was added with last patch.
---
Awesome, thank you üëç
---
One for combat armor? If so, want to sell one?
---
I've never seen one at Watoga in the week+ I've been actively looking. Just started hopping to Watoga as well, 12 times nothing, I'm on my 13th now.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 
---
It‚Äôs all in the perks, especially demolition expert and armor piercing legendaries plus the explosive. You can find builds like that on nukes and dragons.
---
I just get killed in one or two hits by everything. If there‚Äôs scaling in place that makes lower level players deal more and take less, that‚Äôs dumb. It means that players over 100 are required to have the best builds, and can‚Äôt have any fun with a plain old machete.
---
That would be cool as an optional setting. I wouldn't want my vendor sticking around when I'm not on. I'm close to max caps so what happens when I've got no cap space left lol. Free shit for everyone üòñ
---
Yeah, they've basically reversed themselves and made PvE servers ...  camp damage is for sure next on the chopping block
---
What a horrible analogy.
---
None of the stuff in the game is real. If it affects you emotionally to get killed and teabagged by a 12 year old, go and play some games that are co op only...
---
I've seen Light Metal Chest/Legs/Arms.
---
But I haven't seen Sturdy or Heavy Metal plans anywhere (lvl 118, and I've found Light/Sturdy/Heavy Robot, and all Leather, Combat, and Marine).
---
Are you wanting plans for the Mods?  I would hazard a guess that Metal should work the same as the Leather and Combat, where learning a mod by scrapping one tier can be applied to all tiers?
---
lol, yeah I dunno if its new or anything but its pretty funny and sad at the same time
---
That's not true at all. This sub is very much pro dupe. Look at some of the threads.
---
You got my upvote for the ‚Äúmy two caps‚Äù phrase alone. Also a good idea tho. 
---
I'm well aware of that. 
---
But that's not the point of the post. 
---
Just gonna leave this here. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gzmoqmL7g
---
The problem is that since Bethesda doesn't really have any way to know if a certain item is duped or not since those items don't have any kind of ID in common (We know this from a) The fact that nothing in the game code points to item have an "identification ID" of sorts other than the standard RefID that's in all the CreationEngine games, but that's different for every duped item also the fact that b) They said they don't have any way to reliably do this themselves in support replies and c) Their previous method of dupe purging kinda confirms this anyway) you would essentially be deleting legit items with this as well if you were to actually set an algorithm.
---
Plus I don't care if my TSE Gatling Gun is duped or not, I still paid 15K Caps for it, as well as 8K for my TSE Combat Shotgun, so I (And most of the community, really) would be understandably majorly pissed off if these items were to just randomly vanish without an equivalent refund. 
---
If anything perks need to be balanced more
---
Thanks for posting this as I was going to as well :)  I found 3 honey beasts at that camping spot near white springs, where yao gui and whatnot spawn, and the spawned bees counted as well as natural spawn bees!
---
Or there should be a cap of how much damage can be done to a player in one shot
---
Due to a server disconnect while trading with my friend, I lost my Hunter's Long Coat. After a few hours, I finally got the vendor to spawn and did the re-log trick with my friend. After about the 20th try, I walked up to the vendor just as another player spawned near the area. Their presence triggered the random event again; the small horde of super mutants. As they shoot and throw grenades, I see the Vendor Bot on fire. I run up to quickly check his inventory before he dies and I see it; the Hunter's Long Coat. I press X to purchase as fast as I can : "Trade failed on server." 
---
I immediately log off for the day. 
---
Fair point, they could be evenly matched. 
---
It‚Äôs like a drug dealer giving a free ‚Äòtaste‚Äô. 
---
I do agree that explosive shotguns are op but it‚Äôs all about the AAE auto handmades now
---
Ya they said your vendor will be marked on the map as a shop or something like that. People will see it 
---
That looks amazeballs 
---
üëç well, I‚Äôd love to learn more of your faction! 
---
Stormbuilders seems popular...
---
I have a strong believe that starvation that is severe enough to make the AP bar red and impacted also cause an incorrect susceptibility to egg head mutating. Both of my characters have actually experienced it. My executive dysfunction leads to a lack of attending to my eating and I use dirty water often for my bloodied playstyle so I stayed hydrated that way. I declare that this is the bug, and I will test it with my 5th character slot by acquiring the hazmat suit and continuing to test starvation with radiation exposure and without it to see what mutations can happen and if any other patterns with higher susceptibility exist.
---
Message me when you‚Äôre on 
---
I had the cow (pack and all) spawn but the vendor didn‚Äôt, probably because someone‚Äôs camp had water purifiers right near where he appears. I really wanted to destroy the camp but realized that like others have said, it was probably someone that didn‚Äôt know any better. 
---
Disagree. Scortchbeast is good eatin. 
---
Yea I think that‚Äôs where everyone wants it to go and is what it‚Äôs gonna take for this game to reach its potential.
---
I hope people keep playing long enough for us to get there and the devs relaid that‚Äôs where it needs to go.
---
Same here I recall stumbling across it and being impressed
---
That's reeeaaal far.
---
It works that way in pvp, too. I have to hit someone six times to one-hit them sometimes. Lol. I'm almost certain it's a type of lag that comes from a discrepancy in reading where the attacker and the victim are in relation to each other at the time the attack was made, causing it to register a miss. Ranged weapons don't suffer from this as much, since it pretty much "puts" the bullet where the target is. I've tested this with crits as well. Vats rarely hits a moving target in melee pvp fights for me, since melee vs melee is usually more of a back and forth dance than anything. However, if I jump vats, it almost always hits. Not sure why. 
---
i can solo her with my melee character. no need to waste ammo on the SBQueen. 
---
yeah they are totally going to have to address cap max on the character vs the player vendor\stash box.  Like can sales made on the vendor\stash box just stay on there, which would alloy you to basically go over the max
---
I got the Civil War Hat and Union Hat plan last night in about 10-15 server hops. 
---
We have space and opportunities for all üí™ would you like to join up?
---
For sure, don't have a huge amount of stimpacks but if you're down for diluted ones, I can make you a bunch lol
---
But they aren‚Äôt required or a necessity.  Perhaps you don‚Äôt have the proper build or weapons in the first place if you have to rely on an overpowered (and likely duped) TSE.  
---
I have a few decent weapons but they acquired legitimately.   I busted my ass to get to lvl 150.  Most of my progress came after the nerfs and after the duping craze. 
---
Bethesda made this mess, and then copped out big time by not wiping the servers clean of them in survival.  
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and I can make lead champagne mimosas if anyone needs it!
---
I need all the tic blood tequila drinks to finish it! 
---
(GT: Lady Rot Roh)
---
Good for you. Generally speaking for me, it's a lagged out slide show, and the ONLY way I actually do any damage at all is vats crits. It's the only thing that works. 
---
Because this game is very badly optimized, and specific things, such as nuke zones, make it pretty much unplayable for some folks. 
---
Everyone will be set up outside the back door of white springs soon, ....damn. 
---
Does explosive add anything damage wise in survival? If so does fireproof and the dense cheat mod still negate it? I don't own an explosive weapon to test this and I am starting from scratch so I am trying to find out if anything other than serandipity is worth grabbing.
---
Here's what you need. 
---
\-1 Bloodied melee
---
\-1 Explosive weapon
---
Bloodied melee is for taking out Turrets. Explosive Weapon is for blowing up the mainframe cores instead of taking them down 1 by 1. 
---
Then you want lvl3 picklocking and hacking to skip the reactor part. 
---
Sadly, nothing has worked.  Just tried your idea and no dice.  I am destined to never earn another recipient with this character 
---
And well we're at it. I'd love some sort of radio station that tells you a workshop needs defending in the server. I love helping random people defend but it's often over before I find out and get there. Would be awesome to get an early jump on that! Sucks having to spam check your map. 
---
That's one way to do it. That would be ok 
---
Stealth crits are definitely way better, I just built as a support heavy gunner so I figured I'd share my experience. 
---
The gunner stagger is decent if you're pvping in groups since an ally might be able to get them. 
---
Heavy guns aren't great in pvp, mostly because of the accuracy of nonvats and the high vats cost. I've had much more luck in confined spaces like buildings but far less in any open area. If you're close enough to accurately land most shots they do good, but handmades are gonna win any mid-long range encounter.
---
Exactly. You keep trying to rationalize your dupes. I'll get through the game without em..because you don't need them.
---
Lol I was at work typing fast!!!!
---
Lmao yeah. Though in this case it‚Äôs more like someone sticking their leg out and going ‚Äòlike what you see? ;)‚Äô
---
Just wait until mod support comes out
---
Yes exactly. I have a painted metal chest and I'm trying to upgrade to polish
---
No dilutes. I‚Äôll buy other chems from you tho 
---
The only way to use weapons that aren't melee or sneak snipers builds is with TSE, AAE or BE, there is no way to get around that since you basically do half the damage without them.
---
Plus really it's not TSE weapons that's the problem in Survival, it's the Assassin/Sentinel armor combinations that are making other people immortal. 
---
What we definitely need is some high tier expensive gear that only have marginal benefits over what we normally have, but allows us to use the massive amount of resources we gather. 
---
Not something required to do endgame but definitely something nice to have.
---
only if i can build camps
---
I think you're probably so opposed because you know you'll lose weapons yourself. It's rather evident.
---
My primary weapon is a 1 Star explosive shotgun.  With my shotgun build and perks it tops out around 300dmg.  My hunters dragon is about 280dmg and my prime 2 shot Gauss is 275dmg.  Any one of these three cuts down most enemies in no more than 3 shots.  
---
I also have a nice auto handmade that I‚Äôve crafted and with my alternate rifle build/perks it does ridiculous damage and against armor forgetabout it. 
---
The bullet sponge thing is a joke, BTW.  That‚Äôs code for I‚Äôm lazy and want to take the easy way out with a duped weapon. 
---
Yeah sorry no
---
Put your stash behind a locked door with some shotgun turrets.
---
...I think I just physically feel my heart break
---
Me too, that would be sick!
---
Events need to have global rewards.  When Momma Dolce's gave everybody on the server an XP boost it was great, and it gave people a reason to join the quest.
---
Event rewards for events are weak, and there's no incentives at all for doing them. Of the events worth doing (like Uranium Fever) the loot you get is under leveled for most players. It's more lucrative to walk the streets of Watoga or do Westtek looking for legendaries than it is doing almost any event in game.
---
I agree. Porting to events should at least be half the cost (or, heck, outright free). Give people a reason to try to join 'em.
---
I mean of course I don't want to lose the weapons I paid my legitimate caps for, what do you expect? 
---
This is a great idea, I know a few people with lots of legendaries they need to burn. Maybe one day we could get a server with 4+ people with a ton of extras and do a mass giveaway. 
---
I believe that it is minimal, but the negation is still there.
---
Actually we are about to implement a camp building contest and I‚Äôm sure your fellow brothers and sisters wouldn‚Äôt mind having a hand in setting up camps üëç
---
I just picked up a level 45 one star bloodied .50 cal if you still want one. 
---
Few headshots from my rifle takes down high level super mutants... No TSE required. That's a poor excuse for having a game flooded with duper end-game weapons
---
We went to an area that had soooo much violet flux but I kid you not, not an enemy in sight. Couldn't process a single one.
---
Dude this is happening to me EVERYTIME I encounter a no star legendary Super mutant!  
---
  See when I hit up West Tek, I use a lot of grenades, so I thought he was running from the munitions I'd lobbed at him, but now Ibe confirmed (several different times on several servers) when I approach them wielding a melee weapon he will always yell "retreat!!!" Or "run away"  and I find myself cashing him through the corridors with my Grognak Axe, Wacking away at him like some comical parody of The Shining.
---
&gt; Everyone is always going on about TSE
---
Ehhhh not for a long time
---
&gt; The days of TSE are over.
---
They have been for a few patches.
---
Explosive is still a decent secondary modifier but the meta hasn't been about two-shot for a while now.
---
Good luck with that my friend, you'll still have to rely to people with TSE/AAE/BE Heavy weapons in order to kill those pesky SBQs. 
---
"Final nail in the coffin" üòÇ 
---
They're trying to fix our precious exploits, how dare they?!
---
Not quite. I've played since beta with one large break and my character is terribly speced. He has 1 or 2 ranks in almost every search and combat perk, and can't so shit but fix guns well. 130 is approximately when I'll have enough levels to respec.
---
I wouldn't mind repacking them as 300mm ordinance for some massive bore rifle, they're already shaped like artillery (I assume they *were* fired as artillery!)
---
I have found all the Light Metal plans (Chest, Legs, and Arms) at the shelf to the left of the Armor Bench in Flatwoods.  Seems to rotate thru most of the Light Metal stuff there.
---
I have not bothered to keep any sturdy/heavy metal pieces I find to test if my mods learned work on Sturdy/Heavy, but I think they do?
---
"Few headshots" only proves my point really, there are 30 super Mutants in West Tek alone, and you barely make any ammo out of them by oneshotting them. 
---
Build/gear?
---
Its right under his plea, Xbox
---
I have a shit character because I had no idea what kind of perk were available during beta. I took a huge break and now know 130 is when I can respec
---
God I thought you were talking about stuffing the commie whacker full of explosives and blowing up you and whatever you hit
---
OK, so where is a better spot that
---
- is close to a vendor
---
- has standing water for purifiers
---
- is near a power plant for fusion cores and aluminum
---
- is relatively central in the map
---
- has low level enemies surrounding so they don't regularly damage the camp
---
Bet.
---
How? Normally takes me about 3 days to level
---
I wasn't, but now you are...
---
I would like to get in contact with this guy as well. 
---
Like?
---
Gave me heart failure. I killed like 5 scorchbests last night farming flux and just scrapped the hides.
---
I've been doing this continually since you posted this message. I've lost track of how many times. I ran into a responder vendor bot twice, and no lemonade stand. I'll keep trying all night LOL
---
There's a scary large number for them.
---
Like you are actually going to get a lobby where TSE users aren't actually there.
---
I suppose that also proves my point. 
---
I have 2.5k caps right now. How much do you want for it?
---
Install some spotlights, it might be placebo but I think they need light to see targets better.
---
This looks so dope. This is phenomenal
---
Does it have a white bar over some of the Condition?
---
When you craft, or repair, items, depending on your Perks, you can create or repair them above 100% Condition.  This is displayed as a second, white, bar overtop the yellow CND.  0-100% is the Yellow bar.  100-200% is the white bar.
---
You are probably at slightly above 100%, so any damage is not showing up easily visible.
---
Armor and Melee weapons above 100% have bonus DR (armor, but not ER) / Damage (melee weapons, but not range) proportional to the amount of CND above 100% they have.  0-100% have the same DR/Damage.
---
Any thing that kills an assultron quickly
---
Heard that. üôèüèº
---
I'm not sure I understand your point; everything in the game needs to be a 1 shot kill or its considered a "bullet sponge"? That's embarassing. I have zero legendary equipment in my build, I don't buy any weapons from other players, I don't use any sort of XP exploits for leveling, and somehow I've been able to make my way into endgame with ease. Never run out of ammo before crafting more and always have the mats I need for repairs.
---
It's almost as if these duped legendaries aren't required to keep the game playable...
---
That would be fine. As long as you don‚Äôt have to travel to the ws to do it. 
---
Yo Bethesda when you eventually drop Wastelanders, could Operation Tourniquet be made canon? Since the idea of NPCs and Scorched being together in the same world space seems... unlikely.
---
Alternatively, Operation Tourniquet as the final quest if the new Wastelanders just use the vaccine.
---
The reason is simply numbers. There are only max 24 players per server. Some are doing the main quests, some are cap farming, some are building, some are farming their workshop, and if there's a nuked area, half will be there.
---
I like to do the events but I go for ones I haven't done in a while, and usually I'm the only one doing it. Not many of us survived the apocalypse, and we're spread thin across the map. 
---
I have mine through a couple of locked doors right now but I just like the aesthetic of some of the stash boxes (toolbox with benches, ice machine with cooking and brewing) 
---
Dense plans exist. Just not from vendors anymore. 
---
Yes exactly. I love the crossbow but needs mods and stars! Would like to see explosive and electric bolts too 
---
Switches and automatic doors are stuff put in there by society to conform you into a norm. Fuck that. Break a wall and get in anyway üòÇ
---
Nothing from players. Found some 1* assassins pieces at vendors for 200 caps total snapped em up. Better than nothing.
---
Yes all drop and combat is really rare. I check every Tim's I pass through watoga or Harpers ferry. Got another combat about a week ago. 
---
Ah! That‚Äôs what it is! I was impressed with how many creatures I was taking on and saw no damage, I forgot I even picked up that perk.
---
You know that bloodied, furious, and melee weapons are way stronger than explosive don't you? Why complain about already nerfed weapons that are subpar now? If you have fireproof and PA or fireproof and dense mods then even TSE shotguns take 5-7 shots to kill you which more than fair.
---
I fully support the removal of them all üëç The people that can't accept that it would be for the overall good of the player base are likely the kind of player that can't play well enough to succeed in the game without said equipment
---
I finally did the "claim Bogtown" challenge yesterday, along with the "claim a workshop" daily challenge.  The workshop had been claimed all week, so I just decided to try asking the owner politely.  I was on standard adventure server, but I still walked in with my weapon holstered and gave a friendly wave from far away.  The player waved back, then a workshop defense popped up and I helped him clear out the radrats. Afterwards, I asked if they could hear me and politely asked if they'd mind my capturing the workshop just to get the challenge done and they said sure, they just took it to get the same thing and had no intention of keeping it.  I gave the guy an instigating/ff LMG I'd just got during AWOL that was too heavy to store, as a thank you for his gentlemanly behavior.
---
So yeah, abandoning would be a nice option.  You can "lose control" of the workshop by choosing not to participate in a defense event, but it doesn't seem to work all the time.  Maybe another player happened upon it and defended it for you.  Maybe the super mutants respawned while I was away and took out the attackers.  I have no idea.  I never build turrets when I claim a workshop, because I just don't feel like they're worth the resources required to construct.
---
Sure, I haven‚Äôt had any luck getting one yet.
---
Add me, TimDiv362. I‚Äôm on now for another 15 minutes or so, otherwise tomorrow I‚Äôll be on. 
---
Sorry, I just realized I missed your previous comment! I could do 1.2K for you. It‚Äôs a stalker‚Äôs, reflects 50% of melee damage back while blocking and adds +1 strength. Does it sound like what you‚Äôre looking for?
---
Yh I‚Äôll be on tomorrow 
---
Hey, just sent you a friendly (Nickamus). I would like to make use of several of your serums, and I'll donate to the cause!
---
The aftermarket for dupes is part of the problem. Players that don't care end up enabling those that *REALLY* don't care. Vicious circle of virtual supply and demand that the game could do without
---
What‚Äôs ur username 
---
I think I can get one instance of defeated the SBQ with legit items, yes. Bet?
---
Not gonna lie, I hope they don't change this. I love getting me some nice low level legendaries for my alts.
---
TimDiv362
---
Got it
---
That's exactly it, when the rewards you get for killing a Super Mutants are a few 5.56 bullets, 4-5 caps and some plastic and steel and some exp.
---
It's not that you can't kill them without them, it's just that it needs a lot more resources to do it without them, which basically means that it's not viable to farm it in the first place. And don't get me to the part where you need 800 bullets WITH a TSE weapon when it comes to SBQs.
---
But it's all right, I don't expect you to understand if you haven't reached that point yet. You will eventually reached a point when grinding for things to sell to other players and legendaries is the only thing left to do though. 
---
Nope you can't, unless you literally defeat her by yourself. 
---
Grafton dam won't show up as discovered for me &amp; I have tried with 3 characters, shit is busted since launch. 
---
My CAMP would be FUCKED. 
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about this too. Feel free to message me and maybe we can work something out. There is definitely an opportunity for some good vibes.
---
Homie, I've been looking everywhere for you so I could try my hand at some of your traps. Fecking brilliant, you are

---
I‚Äôm lvl 150, so I don‚Äôt get your point. I travel solo by the way with no backup. 
---
I‚Äôve faced and defeated high level enemies without a duped weapon so thanks for asking. 
---
I found a Two Shot crossbow as my very first Legendary and it's held a special place in my heart lol. 
---
Great. Back to server hopping every day, I guess. It's really my least favorite part about this game.
---
 You're not on XB and feeling inclined to sell one, by any chance?
---
To be fair I, too, would be confused if I came home and found a plumber there that I did not call
---
Sorry to burst the bubble, but that's likely the closest analogue. We've got scorchbeast queen right now, once we've bombed the bog back into the stone age i could see it changing to a new glowing sea, pushing players that lived there for queen raids out. 
---
All that extra radiation plus the vaults opening by that point would organically lead to the strangler vines in the mire, new end boss. End raid mechanic could be a vault self destruct mad dash to the exit, and the end of that season be more sinkholes like big maw showing up. 
---
Season 3 with the bog and mire exploded in various ways, introduce new enemy types that give rare crafting materials but are a bitch to actually take down, and have them spawning primarily in the 3 lower level zones to make that season of survival more interesting and encourage crafting more advanced things that can be introduced in prior and following patches such as
---
 mutation station: irradiates and cleans at the same time to induce mutation, crafting cost, 5 of each flux plus base material steel and whatnot.
---
This all still assuming they don't introduce more npc factions to alter beyond my possible predictions. 
---
Eh? I could have more than just myself. If we were to all stream it
---
Dupers are long gone in this game though thanks to the measures that Bethesda put in place though, so those duped items from the 0re patch are really all that's left, until the legendary vendor comes out. 
---
I disagree. At most ill use 10 Gauss Rifle shots and about 50 5.56 rounds. They're quick to kill and I usually get some food or stim, as well as a fair amount of xp.
---
Many turrets in the game worlds of the Fallout series can have their targeting parameters changed with terminals.
---
I believe that our ability to configure turret behavior would help suit different play styles, role playing, and even PvP in survival mode
---
Some players welcome any wanderers to use their CAMPs, while others lock the doors and are suspicious of any that approach. Maybe they want to go a step further and keep people away entirely with turrets.
---
Some turrets in the world attack any player that approaches, yet ours cannot be configured that way.
---
In Survival mode, some players may want their CAMP to be a PvP weapon. Maybe people should have to use caution when approaching a foreign CAMP.
---
I personally want my CAMP to attack anything hostile that comes into range, instead of waiting for it to both attack and enter the CAMP perimeter.
---
Currently, my turrets will ignore attackers unless they are 5 feet from the CAMP structure and also attacking it, the result of this is that every time I'm at CAMP, there are enemies that I have to go take out myself every 5 minutes because the turrets are doing nothing.
---
I can't do anything at CAMP without constantly being annoyed by enemies, and I had hoped that was the purpose of CAMP defenses.
---
Do you mean the overturned bus west of Janets? I didn't see a bus down the southern road
---
I only play a few hours a day and not every day. Events get it up fairly quick occasional nuke zone gets a few levels. 
---
I think larger servers would be interesting in the future. If we‚Äôre rebuilding Appalachia we could have a big update with larger servers and a quest to support the update with some lore who knows maybe a year from now if enough people are still playing they could try that 
---
Sounds good, I‚Äôll shoot you a message tomorrow when I get home tomorrow night. I‚Äôll be on all night so anytime tomorrow night will work!
---
So long as it doesn't look like some kind of gothed out fantasy armor, I'd be into it.
---
I think the trapper armor is over the top with all the spikes and goofy Mad Max stuff.  You're more likely to hurt yourself wearing armor like that than anything else.
---
Try to hop a fence, a spike gets caught and you've got a broken wrist, a bent front sight and half your ammo mags are lying in a muddy puddle in the middle of Cranberry Bog with scorchbeasts flying around.  That would be a really shit afternoon.
---
Thank you!  I just want to see more Excavator designs!
---
I'm using a level 35 Bloodied and doing 350 damage. I wish my quad crossbows were bloodied. I also wish priming them was reversible and actually a good idea in the first place.
---
I just put mine away if I'm not actively swinging it for that very reason. 
---
Yes
---
PS4 and it's the only spare I have. Gotta keep one in case I come across a chest I cant live without. 
---
Thanks anyway
---
This is a great question. And if you can not abandon them, how have I stumbled across so many unclaimed workshops that are already built up? 
---
I can't lie, this made me snort lmao
---
Yeah I guess it is West not sure why I keep thinking its south.  Sorry about that
---
You can all have the whole lobby on your server to stream it? Again, good luck with that. 
---
Plus, it's not a question of doing it once so that you can prove to a random guy on Reddit that it's possible, it's how much more tedious it gets after you have done it for the 442th time and you had to craft triple the amount of ammo (And the amount I craft is already enough honestly) because you don't have your TSE/AAE/BE/Whatever weapon with you anymore. 
---
Damn 350? Shit. 
---
You're welcome üòÇ
---
Maybe learn the mechanics and how to counter them before criticising them. Explosive weapons were already nerfed and are far from OP, nearly useless if someone is running the right perks and mods.
---
Sometimes you outright glitch into walls too
---
Iirc, one of the dataminers found either some keywords or a model of the Fallout 76 bobblehead stand. I believe it's just not in-game yet.
---

---
I'd like to see more game to go with the paint work shop
---
Maybe your build is ass.
---
Unfortunately I would need to dismantle part of the CAMP or get rid of the furniture in order to have budget for spotlights. Spotlights should also not be necessary during the day. It may be that spotlights are a contributing factor, but if so, the budget requirement for turrets should be reduced accordingly if they don't function on their own.
---
Wait for a legendary drop.
---
Or buy someone else‚Äôs 
---
You mean that you tube guy showing his rifle at 1400 dmg wasn‚Äôt a dupe?  
---
with my crappy laptop speakers, he's not intelligible at all. I have to put on headphones.

A valiant effort that honored the memories of all those before us who fell in the fight against the Scorched menace.
---
Shame nothing actually came of it but community operations like this are what make online games so great.
---
This would be cool if it was a DJ who called this out between songs on Appalachia Radio. 
---
I know that there are no human NPCs. But I do miss Travis and Three Dog. 
---
Exactly. When people bitch about the TSE, all that's going to cause is them to Nerf it even more.
---
Maybe one day...
---
Hope you're not a Hallusinthe, here to spy on me
---
They meant decisions the players make, not that they make
---
Hopefully not overlooking the golf club. I always go out of my way to wreck the player houses with turrets trained on the main club building.
---
That's a bad idea, it would negate alot of perks and neuter the stat known as perception.
---
OMG yes.  I tend to use my "back-up" vampire regular sledge more than my "primo" three star super sledge just so I can hear what my friends are saying.
---
"Hey sorry Babe I can't hear you.  Yeah.  Yep.  Uh-huh...... Of course I'm using my super sledge.  I have a scorchbeast queen in front of me and about a dozen randos all around.  Yes I know.  I'll leave it outside when I come home tonight.  Listen, let me call you back.  This damn queen is screeching sonic booms at me, I have a radscorpion up my ass and my super sledge is doing that thing again.  Yes.  Yeah, that whining noise.  I'LL LEAVE IT IN THE GARAGE.  Yes I'll take a shower before coming to bed.  Listen I really gotta go....."
---
Not gonna lie I still like my level five tse pistol 
---
Later, you'll be thankful you can swap the level 3 out for a level 1, if you even need it at all by then.
---
Bad programming on Bethesda‚Äôs side. Each weapon should be given a unique ID and tagged with creation time so no two will ever exist at the same time. Now in order to identify dupers they messed up objects‚Äôs ID further so Legendaries can‚Äôt be recognized properly on clients‚Äô sides. When you have two Legendaries of the same type, say two legendary LMGs, you can‚Äôt add both to the hot wheel or one will disappear from it the next time you log in.

Got one today in watoga for 58 caps.

I will keep summoning you until this is clarified
---
Yes they do in Watoga.  Got one today finally.
---
Getting on now, GT is D1E HARD TOO, I'm stuck in WhiteSprings because my carry weight is maxed lol 
---
I run watoga now sneak shotting and instant killing level 50 robots. Very nice amount of legendaries, and easy materials back for more ammo.
---
Let me use my explosive two shot minigun in peace
---
Good to know! Must have brought them back into the pool. They used to be a bit more common then everyone started catching on to what it did and Bethesda took them out of the pool. 
---
That makes two power armor sets then by my account. One near the crashed vertibird by the robotics disposal site and the actually raider infested USAF hearing station and the one you get from the minutemen minutes after you come back to sanctuary with it.
---
Seriously. Raiders in fallout 4 are dumb. In fallout 3 you could make the argument that PA is actually scarce and only found by normal raiders by dumb luck or by scavenging dead enclave/bos soldiers bodies, witch likely would be their demise. But in both fallout 4 and west Virginia it can be quite plentiful. Especially considering that in West Virginia everyone else but vault 76 dwellers is dead. And vault 76 residents are supposed to be the best and brightest at whatever they are. So it's not at all a overstretch to roleplay raider on XO-1 suits and bos combat gear.  Kudos for you if you don't actually, but lore wise a player is not in the wrong for playing this way either.
---
I think dupes are a joke - BTW all this talk about weapone when honestly the sentinel blends (cav or assaskns) are far worse. 
---
But the spawn killing glitch and leaderboard is a bigger problem right now. 
---
I‚Äôll come to u
---
Awesome man
---
Excuses because you want an easy time. I assume you are pro-hacking in other games then since it makes the end game easier
---
I'm pretty sure the only event with a radio alert is the Sons of Dane one
---
I was thinking about making a sneaking character for my next toon. I just finished my adrenaline rush melee build. He‚Äôs pretty good at taking down scorched beast but I‚Äôm not sure if he would be that great for pvp. 
---
LOLOL
---
Damn. I might have to do it. 
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
Which area produced the most violet flux?
---
I‚Äôll do that. In a quest right now
---
Congrats? You still wasted much more ammo than you needed to by using a non-legendary weapon, which means that in the long term you are getting much less reward for the time you spent on it.
---
But hey, if you actually want to make the more far more grind than it already is, then you are welcome to suggest that to Bethesda... Problem is that with the amount of people complaining and actually leaving the game after the nerf of the TSE weapons (Something that showed on Reddit as well from all the complains from that time), you would basically leave the game for dead, no matter what you "non duped purists" think.
---
And lvl 150 is really not that high (I'm higher than that and I play this game 2 times a week at best), I've known people that are over lvl 500 that wouldn't have kept going at all if it wasn't for TSE weapons.
---
I have over 65 bobble heads in my stash for this very reason 
---
You don't need chest plans for that. Just keep crafting and scrapping minimum-level arms, and you'll get the chest mods eventually.
---
Could always have the alternative where you get more weapon damage to be like melee with str. 
---
Any chance you're on XB and want to sell it?
---
The robot in the shopping trolley was amazing haha
---
Other than the Fasnacht parade and nukes, events do not have notifications, so they come and go without people noticing unless they happen to look at the map regularly. I only look when I'm going to fast travel.
---
Notifications of significant server wide events could increase participation.
---
Unfortunately, most current events are not interesting or challenging.
---
It seems that the majority are to protect a slow moving robot while it completes some task, fetch quests, or travel to several locations and fight low level monsters, and the rewards are useless non legendary items and a couple caps.
---
Why would players pay caps to travel so they can partake in such dull and repetitive activities with little reward?
---
Most of the events are not enjoyable enough for people to want to complete them just for fun.
---
Ya, that too.  Learned mods aren't specific to the piece you are scrapping.
---
Okie dokie! My PSN is radiationdaddy
---
Truth to be told this is what i expected from F76 on release.
---
Traded an unyield sent for aae piece, bought several van sent/cav pieces for 10k or so. Cav and sent dont work quite as well in pvp servers. 
---
If If you are wearing chameleon armor that has been know to bug the quest just have remove it and try again.
---
What prices each?
---
They said it causes server instability so it looks like it‚Äôs a technical issue vs policy now.  While it is a persons fault when money bag falls out of the armor truck to know it‚Äôs wrong Beth could have minimize the issue.  
---
First it was a bad decision to have no weight limit.  It would have minimize the impact of duping. 
---
Second the devs took weeks to address duping and the fix was so silly it had workarounds quickly.  Even if it wasn‚Äôt for duping the unlimited weight would have cause the same instability issues down the road.  
---
Also I had friends who got unbanned for those few days got rid of the items to go under weight limit and got rebanned.  So the accounts are normal now but still lumped together with people who have millions of weight.
---
In the end what does banning accomplish?  There are a plethora of games out there, and people move on,  most likely never buy a Beth product again.
---
Its a shame an AAA title is treated like a straight to DVD movie.
---
90% of the time, I too am alone in doing events
---
Whatever honestly, if you think that not wanting the game to be insufferably tedious (Something this game would certainly become without OP weapons, whatever they are duped or not and without significant changes to the bullet sponginess) is the same thing as being pro-hacking then I honestly don't want to keep this conversation going anyway, yours is just being classic fanboyism (Which is typical of this sub I gotta say). 
---
Depends on the Chem
---
I don't know about you, but I find having **4** Woodchucker perk cards means that I never have to use a dirty one. Kinda like underwear.
---
Just dont kill the legendary ones while 15 feet away. Kinda hurts.
---
I‚Äôll go 10 each on all that in bulk ??
---
Same thing is happening with my pistols. 95% chance, 3 feet in front of me, miss the whole clip.
---
I haven't found many Legendary crossbows sadly. I found a armor ignoring one but it was level 15.
---
Damn son!! So what are your base points (I should have clarified)? And how the hell did you get so many over 15? That's just crazy. I think I only have 1 skill that hits 18 so I'm obviously not doing it right. 
---
Sure bud.
---
Character  visuals should not be forced but math. What do you mean by that?
---
Can I have the Marine plans locations please
---
Let‚Äôs get this seen!
---
Not true. Damage multipliers compound. 
---
i'll see you soon
---
FO76 has been lacking a player hub and this could be the way of fixing it.
---
I didn't think you could place camps that close to train stations.
---
Hmmm I wonder if my pet deathclaws could get that close.
---
Easiest way i know is to go to one of the outer traders to find the plan to make it, im pretty sure ive seen it in vendors before, either Watoga or Harps Ferry maybe. 
---
American Patriot I believe it was called. I guess it was limited time? Don‚Äôt remember, but I always try and have 1-2000 atoms saved for limited time PA paints; they‚Äôre just about the only thing I buy 
---
No. It‚Äôs immersion breaking. It‚Äôs counter to the idea of survival. 
---
As far as I know, they stopped explosive energy weapons from dropping ("it doesn't make sense" their words) and many energy weapons with explosive don't benefit from demo expert.
---
Ive got an AAE gatling plasma, and it too is my favorite weapon lol
---
You need to go to the Bethesda Gear store and order an Catheter-Boy 3000
---
How about screws?
---
Doesn't even seem to take a grenade, I wack a Deathclaw with a fire axe and then have to chase the corpse half way across the map.
---
JOKES ON YOU.
---
  
---
You already looked cool
---
Added you, fast travel to me when ready
---
In data under known events, Banjo wants to be able to tag favorites
---
Remove chameleon armor and sneak perks they have been causing the quest to bug out. 
---
I like the guy in the middle, he‚Äôs ballsy. I would stood there to see if I died when they hit lol
---
Ah, I‚Äôm overencumbered! Is there any way you could run down to the Watoga Station?
---
It‚Äôs on the driving range looking green by the big retaining wall that has the bridge going to it.
---
my stash is full of bobbleheads and magazines for the day when we can hopefully display them 
---
Thank you for the idea! Lol. Jk, but you are just giving people ideas. 
---
my stash is full of bobbleheads and magazines just waiting for the day when we can display them. 
---
I have this camp that I worked hard on, but want to do other things with my camp, but not get that one destroyed. Maybe like how there's a limit to blueprint slots, there should be a limit like that with this feature
---
Love the dog too, but that's why I stayed lower. That and I really like using bridges. 
---
yeah, I put the arch in after the base was done. with the door closed it attracted less attention. I got bombed once though.
---
Not me if you've tried in the last few weeks. Popular spot though. I got bounced many times. 
---
Yea
---
there are. All those dumpsters outside and the crates I use to make it look like the floating floor is being held up all function as stash boxes. 
---
Loading into your world now!
---
PC. love the dog, but I wanted the resources, etc. below. 
---
Area around the grafton dam had a lot  as did the northern one. Along the rivers edge was lucrative. I think we pulled 160+/each walking out of there with the double pick perk. Bottom left ring was more yellowcake. Next to no crimson flux was found in this 3x hit. Low cobalt as well. Lucrative Violet and Yellowcake tho.
---
Its kinda hard for me to look through my power armor sets, trying to find the right one. 
---
Here you go: [https://imgur.com/gallery/scZyRJz](https://imgur.com/gallery/scZyRJz) 
---
So, I feel like your fast travel relates to where you put your physical c.a.m.p. I built from the cliff wall and I put the camp on an outcropping. I'd regularly fast travel right onto the cliff face and land on an outcropping. Actually it happened so much there's a door and a little ladder that just leads down to an empty space on the wall where I kept warping in, like a dedicated door. 
---
You won‚Äôt find the lemonade vendor at this spawn point. Just the responder vendor.
---
The fast travel cost is seriously annoying when you show up and the event's either nearly out of time or marked in the wrong place. Census Violence was a great one for that.
---
Most of the event rewards are a joke though. One of my team had their base down in the Bog, so we did Distant Thunder a few dozen times. I think we got two plans between us that weren't on the level of T-60 Motion Assist Servos. If we couldn't walk there in 30 seconds we'd never have bothered showing up.
---
Look at me... I'm the Whitesprings ghoul now 
---
Once you get a decent build You can grind a levels fast.  Run white springs kill all ghouls. Server hop, repeat. It‚Äôs not uncommon for me to get 5 levels a day on weekends.
---
Pacifying anything only lasts temporarily.
---
Outstanding, thank you!!
---
I was pleasantly surprised how many non-destructive visits I got from players. only really got bombed once. And the concrete walls I set up along the bridge struts on the ground basically kept out most of the random monster mobs. Fixing those was was cheap and easy. 
---
Would have been crazy with all 3 smacking earth within a second! 
---
And it doesn't make sense in terms of gameplay to run up to a door and go "hang on I need to unequip 2 perks and then equip my lockpicking perk" then pick the lock and then switch it back
---
All in 1 spot??
---
It doesn't help that it's such a perfect spot for a camp. Water, flat ground for food, a nearby vendor, and a good place to start exploring the Charleston area.
---
I meant can you hit all in 1 spot?
---
Flatwoods. A guy makes his camp into  player traps (hes kinda famous( you might know who I'm talking about)) and his location is flatwoods, because there are a lot of new players
---
WHAT WAS THAT NOISE?!?!
---
Oh yes, we've double nuked whitesprings a few times,  nearly matching rings. Makes the game a bit unstable BUT everything seems to spawn a LOT faster and more of said spawns.
---
Just came across this helped me I can shoot all targets in time but they even after hitting them wouldn't register so kept failing took the advice of the melee weapon and it actually worked I was getting very annoyed by how glitchy this quest was
---
A preset function would actually be awesome, maybe make it so you get 3 pages that can only be changed while in your camp or something
---
I used it sorry, been  looking for awhile for it. 
---
After generating a one time code, go under the house to find a keypad and safe.  Under the deck is the hidden safe.
---
Thanks anyway, I'll just keep bouncing
---
It‚Äôs under lights I think. It‚Äôs the open sign and the neon letters.
---
This fantastic fellow hooked me up with a serum this evening.  Friendly and kind as can be, I just wish I'd been able to do more for him then donate a few extra flux.  Thanks for the serum and the inspiration!
---
How much Woodchucker perk cards could you chuck if you could chuck Woodchucker perk cards, that's some luck though
---
I get that, but I guess my issue is, if I pacify it, then run across the street to pick pumpkins, I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to go from being pacified to not while I‚Äôm doing that and turn on me. I would just expect it to stay pacified while I‚Äôm in the area or a max of so many minutes while in that area. But 1-2 minutes seems awful short, IMO. 
---
Go through torture chambers, clinics, those sort of rooms. They usually have a stimpack sitting on a tray
---
I don't see the need for it to really be free.  With free travel from anywhere to the vault, keep your camp just south/south-east of Whitesprings and little in the game is many caps at that point. 
---
On the otherhand, why am I advocating against this?  I should really investigate my priorities.
---
I've done 5 Scorchbeast Queen runs and none have given me any items (infinite loop). These are assuming that I don't get disconnected.
---
They appear there about an hour after radiation zone disappears. 
---
I loved the New Years Eve event. I also loved the community with the Parade event. The in game culture in FO76 is so good, its a shame there is not that player hub just to meet up.
---
Its also the worsr exploit in adventure mode, people tagging workshops so they can just initiate pvo with you whenever they choose but never actually take the workshop.  
---
PvPers will say "you agrees to this when you took the workshop" but no, i agreed someone might PvP me to contest the workshop, not shoot me in the back and 1 shot my team while were trading with a merchant multiple times with no intention os taking the workshop
---
Now, I could get behind that idea, but concerning the perks, It would screw alot of people out of, and limit the variety of builds.
---
No, thank you for the tip.
---
::sigh::   just so many reasons why those of us who don't have all the gaming experience that many of other players have just want an EASY MODE with decreased combat and a little slower "monsters." Lol
---
I once tried to be tony stark during that one scene from the first Iron Man movie with the missiles, so I put on my best suit, dropped a nuke, and looked away, then everybody died. The End
---
Or have sunglasses actually dim the damn lights. Damn. I need a little sun visor for my power armor.
---
This is especially egregious when I'm fighting ten super mutants and I can't see any of them because they have the sun behind them and they all have miniguns. The speed with which I die is rendered extremely accurately, however.
---
I'm just going to leave this here:  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0u6Lb6RCz4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0u6Lb6RCz4) 
---
Your correct.  The dick comment was aimed more at anyone who decides to destroy the camps for no reason other then they thought it prevents the spawn.
---
Hell yeah
---
If you want the achievement you don't have to nuke fissure prime. I nuked mama dolce for the flux. It's more useful.
---
Unsung hero in pve? Either you‚Äôre 1 hitting everything before the rest of us tag it for exp, or you dont benefit the legendary effect because you didn‚Äôt hit it at full health. Instigating is a solo weapon at best. 
---
Ive said this multiple rimes as the best option for workshops, still allows for optional PvP that way, even if it was auto PvP if the owner was inside the workshop boundaries so they dont gain an unfair advantage either
---
Yeah, showing up for an event that ends without getting rewards is a pain. They said they were looking to address that a while ago, but haven't heard anything lately.
---
I kinda stock up on useless ammo in my stash. Trains404 
---
It was always like this. This is a big reason why so many others left the game while you stayed behind. 
---
Ps4 in Australia online ok.
---
But if other players want it they will be hostile with you
---
So... you got some
---
Quit crying like a bitch.
---
Bethesda has banned and done what they plan to and have said already. So stop complaining and adapt. The weapons and armor are here to stay.
---
Making all the Train Stations free fast travel points would help to make Whitesprings a good hub as well as making fast travel around the map a little cheaper 
---
Flatwoods church cash register, in front of the vendor
---
This kinda sounds like a tinder profile
---
Yep
---
Haha, well my reasoning is just that free fast travel will just encourage that much more travel to whitesprings and an easy central meet up point. The vault is pretty far north and west.
---
Also, having the free fast travel at Whitesprings means you don't have to build your CAMP there for free fast travel and you can build it in numerous other beautiful locations throughout Appalachia. There are so many spots I want to put my CAMP, but instead keep it in one spot just because of fast travel costs.
---
So a legendary is now not "legit" to use. Haha this is the most ass backwards elitist bullshit I've ever seen, you think you're better than others because you refuse to optimize? Lmao you're foolish.
---
I'm on PC and can barely hear him.
---
People who owned them then left the server, the things they built are still there but the players are gone
---
Saddly you can't sell it to venders
---
Awesome
---
Any weapon is equally as capable of being duped. Not all the god tier things were "made" by dupers lol. I have a TSE lever and a Ass/Sent set that I have FARMED for. I have 500+ hours on my only toon.
---
If Bethesda is listening to comments beyond posts..  Can I piggy back?
---
I want Nuka-Echo.  For ten minutes everywhere you go,, you see echoes of people reacting in place (on bar stools, at a piano, driving, what/where-ever they were doing as they were incinerated. 
---
Looks amazing. I wish the crotch-guard were black instead of yellow. The yellow draws attention there more than I prefer. But still, top-notch design.
---
Until they nerf TSE again because it's the PVP meta.
---
Why a robot NPC when we could just have words on the screen, its all about getting immersed in the game my friend, its all just code at the end of the day but you can either be help code, a 'robot' or a 'person' 
---
Yes, Sarcastic (yes), Question (yes), No (yes).
---
My bloodied explosive gauss does 1450 damage at its maximum. That's with bloodied, adrenal, nerd rage, all damage perks related to, and my hp below 20%. I can one shot any human player I have seen so far in survival, at this maximum damage point. The only rifle I could use with higher damage is an identical The Dragon. I prefer the dps though if things get sticky, like more than one opponent, miss a shot, etc.
---
Do magazines that we‚Äôve consumed, reappear? 
---
I like stormbuilders 
---
Yea! When I was designing it I did make it black at first, but as I started placing the other black elements it started to lose the contrast I was still trying to maintain.  
---
Shotguns, no. Pipe Revolver Rifle, yes.
---
I think the Tesla is supposed to use different perks depending on the receiver, but I haven't tested it. Semi-auto receiver would be the rifle one if so.
---
I think the randomness and inconsistency in rewards for events turn off a lot of players.  I've been doing a lot more events lately, trying to get ultra-rare plans, outfits, etc.  I've also been digging up treasure map locations much more.  As a stealth/rifle enthusiast, I've been hunting for shielded raider underarmor plans since probably mid-November.
---
I'm fairly certain that clicking "join event" to fast travel directly to it is actually cheaper than fast traveling to the nearest location.  From my camp I can travel to Harper's Ferry for about 15 caps, and joining Dropped Connection is like 11.
---
I'm ok with the event rewards out in the Forest, Toxic Valley and Ash Heap, as it seems foolish to throw legendary gear at low level players like candy, but Bog and Mire events need to be beefed up as something for high level characters to feel a need to join.  AWOL is decent for a guaranteed 3-star lvl 50+ boss and it's quick, but Census Violence, Line In The Sand, Heart of the Swamp and other high level area events don't hold much of anything worth the time investment.  Given that you have to fight at least three scorchbeasts in Line in the Sand, it should have a guaranteed 3-star item or really special/unique plans to make the fight worth it.  Yes, the scorchbeasts can drop ultracite plans, but I don't find the ammo worth making and I favor T-51b and X-01 over ultracite PA.
---
Being partied up with at least one other person will improve legendary spawns for events dramatically.  I have a couple good pals that I play with almost every evening, and events have become part of our ritual.  Maybe 1-2 weeks ago my good buddy, her pal and I did AWOL and we got two 3-star gutsies and one single star.  It was cool.  The worst part was finding the wreckage in the tall grass after they blew themselves up along with all the nearby cars.  One carcass flew almost all the way to the steakhouse.  I never wanted a metal detector or "corpse sensors" more.  Finding legendary robot carcasses is certainly more challenging than actually killing them.
---
Today I bought a suit of shielded road leathers from a young-ish player (sounded like a teenager) around lvl 45, and the poor kid was like the only employee at a Walmart on Black Friday.  I don't know how he got the plan, be he was not prepared for the inundation of requests whatsoever.  He was literally running in circles trying to gather materials from patrons, craft and sell in a timely manner, and he was having a difficult time keeping track of who gave materials, who was still waiting, who already got their armor, etc.  I honestly felt bad for the guy and tried to keep him calm with encouraging words while waiting patiently.  He was in sub-meltdown phase when I ported to him, and it got worse and worse as more people showed up, so I tried to keep track of orders and materials for him, as I came early and was part of his team.  I eventually got my armor, but another guy was waiting forever, kept getting forgotten because he wasn't standing in place, and was obviously getting pissed.  I wound up going into my stash for extra fluorescent flux because I fucked up somewhere and didn't have enough for everyone there, but a whitesprings nuke happened later and I was back up to 20+.  No big deal.  It was crazy and kinda fun, very reminiscent of one summer in high school being a short order cook at a busy New England clam stand.
---
I'm all for some items being very, very rare, but it felt a little crazy that this one poor kid had an incredibly rare plan that literally the rest of the server wanted and was waiting for.  He was doing his best to gather and collect materials and keep track of who got what while keeping everyone happy.  I hope at some point player-to-player trading/vending makes it easier to craft and sell very rare stuff instead of a clunky process of material donation, crafting and going through the not-so-user-friendly trade menu to set the price.  I'd rather not dump a baggie of ballistic fiber, stable flux, etc on the ground that any greedy fool can pick up before the intended recipient can get to it.  Giving it all away for 0 in the trade menu works, but when you're trying to make stuff for 20 other players, I can see how one would get stressed out.
---
AAE
---
Yeah i have so many duplicates and im a person who likes to be organized with stuff like that. I hate the perk system in the game.
---
Depends on what the 3 stars are. Bloodied, swing speed, +1str maybe over 12k
---
Probably future dlc content- they did it in 4 so I don‚Äôt see why it would be that hard to import such a stand 
---
I have x01 Tesla chestpiece mod from enclave 285 caps, weak but helps on ads.
---
I think they need to make non-power armor stronger and more useful. I hate that in the end game and nuke zones, they kinda force you to wear the ugly bulky things.
---
Um, I think you might have responded to the wrong post?  I agree with what you said, but none of it really had anything to do with what I was saying, that duped items aren‚Äôt needed to do lots of damage.
---
We're meant to be able to place items as decorations inside our Camp at some point or another, maybe in the same update as player vending.
---
The feature of holding the "pick up" button to move something is deliberately missing from the game, probably to prevent you from dragging bodies or loot away from other players, or something in that general vein.
---
I know a guy who has all of them
---
Names hunter20015
---
My Bloodied, explosive, vats cost reduction Gauss rifle isn't duped, so it doesn't count as a legendary?
---
It‚Äôs made for pvp 
---
No they can not
---
That's his PsN?
---
Just kill shit man. Youll level up super fast if u grind enemies. Good times
---
You're beating a dead horse. The weapons are staying.
---
Yeah the place that was the background image for a while is very close to vault 76
---
Yes and it says hes still on just ask him for anything you need, very friendly 
---
If you can lend me some that would be great can‚Äôt right now because it‚Äôs late but in like 4 hours I can.
---
The dome keys you use north of point pleasant. The domes are scaterd around here's what's in them so far
---
-dome 2:alien blaster ammo
---
-dome 3: t-51 nuka-cola paint job
---
-dome 7: x-01 nuka-quantum paint job
---
Armors can have legendary effects that make up for their other short comings. Make it where you can wear a hazmat with armor and you should be fine.
---
I use PA because I like it and favor the BoS play style and RP and I would like to see other people that favor PA be able to use other armors besides X-01.
---
You'd be wrong.
---
I forgot all about it until recently. Unlocked most of my favorite building plans that way, too. I'll have to start holding workshops more often, again.
---
Its more like they are going to risk undoing months of grinding and work for some people. Time is precious, not everyone can grind up a level 100 in a week.
---
It wouldn't trigger for me if the mob died in one shot. find something that takes more than one shot to kill.
---
I just want to see it, im not really interested in picking it up
---
I will look there then
---
From Fallout 3? That's cool!
---
Then drop them all on the ground and log out, record a video clip, and show all of us how far you are willing to go "for the good of the game" lol
---
Please do, Id love to see it
---
As long as you own it, one person can get inside the workshop's range, press the button to contest the workshop, and their teammate can instantly one shot you anywhere on the map.
---
Currently, the only way to stop that is by leaving the server to abandon any workshops you own.
---
I can't even get any. Also what's the point of the water filter when you can have water purifiers in camp?
---
Yeah, there are multiple people with TSE handmades and shotguns on EVERY PVP server. I have only ever found 1, and it was a lvl 20 gatling gun. I'm lvl 155, and have been playing since a month after release. I spend a LOT of time farming. It's impossible that most of these weapons aren't dupe remnants, considering the quantity of them in the game. Same thing with full suits of Assassin/Sentinel armor. And the one-shot kill nerf made it extremely hard to kill these people with VATS crits, which was the only viable defense against them besides a shotgun stagger build. PVP is in it's worst place since prior to the TSE nerf, and I called it the hour the patch notes were released. All the fucktards that had cried about getting sniped and caused this stupid damage limiter came sliming out of their caves where Bloodied snipers had driven them, with their duped weapons and ebay-bought armor...
---
I got two exploding cryolators the day before that patch.  They are pretty fun to play with
---
have nothing against pvp
---
Some are access-able, they are just scattered around. Like dome 7 is the first on the left, dome 3 is two east of 7, dome 2 is next to a dome with a cooking station on the right of dome 2
---
And fallout 4.
---
Oh I was just doing the optional part of the quest
---
Camp Venture and the Train Car west of Watoga Station.  It's not the only one that appears, so it may take a while to get Arms, Legs, and Torso plans to spawn.
---
It could be a robot, no problem.  Or perhaps after you gain entrance to the bunker, you could get map alerts from a Kovac-Muldoon frequency that's constantly scanning Appalachia and alerting Enclave members to potential threats and opportunities to gather supplies for their creepy illuminati cause.
---
Overpowered means just what the name says. Best in slot items should be sought after and coveted, as well as abused once obtained. You shouldn't be shamed for using the best gear, or trying hard. You are either an idiot, or willing to be sub optimal, if you do not want these weapons and armor for your own use.
---
11/10 hella fun 
---
a) We don't have any proof it's not duped even if you say it isn't (I have a standard TSE no third effect Combat Shotgun, I still don't know if that's duped or not honestly) and b) it would still be deleted since the only way to actually delete duped items is to delete legit items thanks to how this game works. 
---
Go capless and without aid , spawn far from stations and keep an eye on loot bags invite randoms and stay safe 
---
Wow, I thought I was slow at \~2 hours per level.
---
At low levels you make a higher proportion of your XP from events &amp; missions, but at high levels it's mostly about the rate you can kill stuff. Maybe pick up some good legendaries to give yourself a head start. You can still make an easy 1400 caps per day even if your build sucks.
---
The only place I‚Äôve seen it is by Grafton.  Which is dumb if a water filter is meant to be an ‚Äúearly game‚Äù method of making drinking water...when the first thing you learn in Flatwoods is to boil water.
---
Personally not noticing any issue with my stuff breaking any more quickly, especially not Power Armor. I do constantly have Gunsmith on so that might explain my lack of gun problems but I never use Power Patcher unless I'm repairing the stuff (meaning I don't benefit from the perk's lower condition damage) and I still haven't had to even think about repairing my Power Armor in ages.
---
I know this is an old post, but I gave you an upvote because until now I couldn't find any conclusive evidence that treasure maps weren't complete crap.
---
I'm really hoping this is the case. Although unless duping is fixed completely we will end up repeating history
---
Standing on a ‚Äúsoapbox‚Äù preaching to anyone who‚Äôs willing to listen. Imagine some nut on the street standing on a box shouting about the lizard men living amongst us. Way back when the term was coined, soapboxes were the standard I guess.
---
(Also I wasn‚Äôt calling you crazy or anything, just wanted to explain the term properly).
---
I bought all of mine, and I didn't know it was dupers? I didn't even know duping was a thing other than super duper perk! See what I did there? You can't prove anybody knew anything.
---
Not sure if I understood, can you list the steps a bit more clearly? I spent a good twenty minutes trying to replicate this haha
---
This is a strsnge thing to see seeing as howbthe brotherhood outcasts are an actual fallout fa tion...
---
Is it the garb of mystery though?
---
The game said server not responding and kicked everyone in the middle of the SBQ fight. We all got relogged without doing anything and the Queen was gone. Xbox (3-31-19)
---
Yeah this is one of the silliest things in the game and I don‚Äôt think it should be like this. 
---
Well other people are not satisfied with mediocrity. I NEED to have the BEST equipment. PvP or not. I did the same in every elder scrolls and fallout previous, all single player. And in a multiplayer game, you damn well better keep up with your peers if you want to hang in PvP with the big boys. 
---
At this point they are already in circulation and if Bethesda did remove them people would go crazy. I personally wouldn't care if I lost some of my gear aslong as I knew it was fixing the game and would prevent any future duping
---
http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/
---
scroll down a bit 
---
each of the different colors (factions) have 200 caps, so you can collect 1400 caps every 20 hours. The next update will combine all factions at Whitesprings. Fort Defiance - easily the best place to get ballistic fiber by collecting military ammo bags. Looting this area will net 10 bags, which works out at 20 ballistic fiber.
---
Glorious outfits 
---
Sent a dm
---
Because my rifle is 1450 damage is it dupe?
---
Took her out earlier today with only slight lag. So glad I spent 1.5k ammo for a cryolator that does extra damage to ghouls.....
---
I understand. I just never heard that term before lmao
---
It's not about an easy mode, it's about allowing all sorts of players, be they casual or hardcore, to play the game mode. 
---
Tbh, I‚Äôm amazed I have. Can‚Äôt remember when or where I heard it though.
---
Wrong. When everything is equal, nothing is unique or better or even bothered to be obtained.
---
Well Maxson would be a no with the radio since this game takes place WAY before fallout 4, 190 in fact, unless fallout 7t6 being 20 years after the great war was retconned or something, but the concept is nice!
---
What made you think you couldn‚Äôt still get them?
---
I didn't realize solo is separate from Player vs. Environment (it's not). Not everyone is out farming legendaries with a pack of asshats trying to one up each other. Plenty of instigating weapons on low level players leave health anyways.  not everyone is playing with other people or thinking about XP in the slightest.
---
Might do SBQ event so probs gonna need high level
---
So you're saying a 10 year old, who cant wipe his own ass, should be able to pick up the game, no knowledge or common sense, and compete with a seasoned player of RPG games, where builds MATTER, doing whatever the hell he wants to do?
---
If they were to implement that into the game, they mind as well make it for all of the drinks.
---
The idea they proposed about adding monthly character wipes would help elliviate any issues caused by duping or even overpowered character. 
---
And its effective by the way. Not affective.
---
Outfits. It's very hit/miss on what he has.
---
I do it if I have the stuff. I was once walking in the mire and saw someone's house getting attacked by a group of scorched. So I wiped them out, but I hit is camp and got a bounty. I fixed up the house and let my girlfriend kill me to remove the bounty.
---
How??
---
Was probably huge in 1990's maybe?
---
I didn‚Äôt even know duping existed, so should I be punished because someone dropped a level 35 the dragon? Just because it was duped?
---
No. It's not. Bloodied explosive, bloodied vats crit are the META for ranged. Bloodied and swing speed are the META for melee. You sir, are just embarrassing yourself with your uneducated nonsense.
---
As controversial as it is, I agree and it's the main reason I haven't got fully back into the game. I'm waiting to see how Bethesda will fix the issue. Until then I just come online every so often to build my base and trade with friends
---
SANCTUARY!!!
---
I forgot what you wrote last time about this. Is it because of the timing on launching a nuke?  Maybe they changed that too?
---
Different Elder Maxson. You‚Äôre thinking about Arthur Maxson, elder of the Commonwealth chapter of the Brotherhood. The founder of the Brotherhood, who we know at least was alive before the Brotherhood was wiped out by he Scorched because of holly apes of radio talks with him, was Roger Maxson. Same last name, different person. 
---
That person in the middle has the perfect view ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
---
always sell to a vendor before you buy from him so you can recapture some of those caps. Sometimes it is cheaper to make new armor than it is to repair the armor you have.
---
Yeah you can still get them. You can also buy one from a fellow player. I have bought like 4-5. 
---
I agree too, my Gauss is at 1500 damage, and I did not dupe it.
---
Unfortubately yes, though the turnout was a little lower that it could of been due to annoying server pop restrictions.
---
Feel free to add me and come visit sometime though, bring your crew too and we can all party, if server population limitations allow.
---
Maybe one with a sprinkler system that you can use high-radiation fluids to grow your own flux (not a ton obviously, just enough to maybe hold you over if you have like 9/10 after leaving a nuke zone)
---
in the world? yes, it's just a temp buff like a chem now so you can have multiples of the same issue in your inventory.
---
Melee has been nerfed really bad since last patch with the ‚Äúone-shot‚Äù nerf
---
I've actually been before üòâ
---
Well, for me, it's about an Easy Mode...it's what i usually  play my other Fallout games on. I don't like all the killing and hard combat, but I love all the other parts of the games, with easier combat,etc. And I really liked having an NPC to have my back. That's just me.
---
 
---
Maybe each event should have specific prizes only obtainable through that single event! Mask, weapons or clothes!
---
The duping people were talking about is the one where people had exorbitant amounts of rare ammo and mats that would be almost impossible to collect. So they got it in a short amount of time. 
---
But there are only so many legendary affixes in the game, so there's statistically a probability that a duplicate of your weapon will LEGITIMATELY appear.
---
If you want to be a jackass who's only feeling of acceptance in life is to lord over other players, maybe find a different game. This is fallout, not ark or rust
---
Ill have to tell you next time I'm on. What platform are you on?
---
I have an extra quad and double crossbow for sale on Xbox. 
---
Wait it's meant for early game but with the snagllygast, butchered that but oh well, one the meanest things in my opinion
---
Thats a different story from what you said. 
---
You can make 1400 caps from vendors per day (there are seven different factions), and the usual approach is to fast-travel through all of them each day, so there's not much value in putting your base in Cranberry Bog.
---
I'm not sure which armor and weapon plans you're talking about. If you're running a rifle build then you'll probably want the handmade and/or lever rifle plans, but to make use of them you'll need a giant pile of screws anyway. From level 45 you're looking to upgrade to legendary weapons and armor, and crafting is primarily used to unlock mods by scrapping.
---
If you're struggling to keep up with repair cost then you probably need specific build/playstyle advice, but we can't provide that without knowing your build.
---
Friend said was unsure 
---
How is it different from when I said "picking up a bunch of stuff you suspected to be duped"?
---
I have done that once already. When a guy I traded with ended up being a duper I dropped everything I got off of trading those items into a suitcase in watoga and left the game. Id do it again if Bethesda guarantee that duped gear is gone for good
---
I agree, everything should be a mystery involving others you know nothing about to begin with, maybe higher perception reveals more information?
---
They didn't announce it. They said they want to implement some feature like this in the future.
---
This is the greatest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. 
---
Not so fun solo when being spawn killed
---
I'm currently broke and on a different platform lol
---
Would be nice to have the option to refund duplicates for points to reuse. Hell, even a full respec you can buy with caps in say, White Spring
---
Tattered dress.
---
If they can make white springs a sanctuary or a non PvP area that be great! In fact i was just killed there earlier today, yay.
---
I believe that patch should be happening next month I believe? 
---
I had that exact same problem around that level. Early on I put most of my perk points in to luck. So I was finding literal tons of ammo for guns I didn‚Äôt have/use. Swapped out perk points and put more in to intelligence. That way I could fix my weapons and armor to 130-160%. And switched to mainly melee, the All Rise and Super Sledge are pretty good. I‚Äôm still hoarding ammo in my stash. I also started using more power armor around level 50. But once I moved perks so that I could fix things better and have them break slower, I‚Äôve not had to hunt for ballistic fiber at all. I actually have some stashed just in case, but I‚Äôll probably drop it when my stash limit gets close. 
---
 Check in at whitesprings often, people drop legendary armor there all the time. Talk to higher level people if you have a mic, I had people fixing up my armor for me and nodding my weapons when I was a lower level. People are nice in the wastelands. 
---
Same. I have friends who upgraded from a crappy laptop to a ryzen 2600... SBQ fight becomes worse
---
I didn't get Grafton Dam too.
---
This is a RPG, you don't have to be optimal all the time. The whole point about fallout is to create your own story, use what you want and have fun. 
---
You've commented on so many of my posts in quick succession, are you afraid of what I said, do you not like that you may lose your edge and be forced to fight fair?
---
1. Your fault for wearing power armor lol 2. Your fault for spawning at the same place to be camped 3. Yes the load times suck and get me killed often
---
Legendary effects make fallout unique and awesome.
---
In the stream, Todd and the devs mentioned that was the hope for survival. You needed to group up to survive.
---
Thanks for the info! Finding tips on dailies is hard to do. 
---
Well you need to prepare better if you wanna hang in PvP here.
---
I would say 10 weapons is a lot. But I drop that almost every hour because I don‚Äôt feel like selling it. 
---
Thousands if not tens of thousands is different then 10 weapons.
---
What makes you think you can't be unique while being on the same playing field. Like I said in a previous comment to you, this is fallout, not some hardcore PvP game. 
---
After our first test, we believed there was enough time for us to launch two more waves of nukes and kill the queen. After one of the updates, either the timing was shortened or something changed about how it‚Äôs refreshed, rendering it currently impossible. 
---
Indeed, but they have no way of actually knowing if yours is actually a legitimate duplicate or just a duped item, the fact that they used a "dumb" "If you have more than one of those rare items it gets deleted" algorithm kinda confirms that by itself already.
---
Plus I bought my TSE Gatling Laser and TSE Combat Shotgun when I had no clue they were duping items like crazy (I just watched a few YT videos about how TSE weapons were the weapons to get on FO76, and then posted a simple WTB request on this subreddit's Discord) so should I be effectively punished for something that was Bethesda's fault at the end of the day? 
---
Agreed. I normally play Bloodied Unyielding build, but always keep my Nuka Quantum X01 in my pocket. 
---
Crap I should delete the post now. Lol
---
Fyi not every explosive weapon is also two shot. Also not every two shot is also explosive. A gun can be both, one of, or either one. 
---
Oh, I see. Thanks for the clarification my guy, you're a lifesaver!
---
Pretty often some spawn at Appalachian Antiques, server hop there til it's ants
---
You're already aware of the fact that you need the full Excavator suit for the carry bonus to work, but I may as well answer your other question.
---
If you have "Calibrated Shocks" mods on both of your T-60 legs you'll get a total carry weight bonus of 100 units, which is the same bonus as having the full Excavator suit. Crafting the mod costs 5 pure violet flux per leg (and some other resources) so it's a bit expensive.
---
On the other hand, there are also Calibrated Shocks mods for the Excavator power armor, so if you can get both of your Excavator legs kitted out with calibrated shocks and you're wearing a full suit of Excavator, you'll get a total bonus of 200 carry weight.
---
I'm getting tired of replying to you, if you actually read my comment I still think gear should give you an edge but not a severe one. If a ten year old finds a build that works for him he should be atleast viable, as long as he tries. I'm not saying anyone can come on and just dominate. The PvP aspect should be more about skill and tactics, not about I have god gear lol
---
I'd like any kind of display stand--take all the Mr. Fuzzy dolls you find, or Jangles the Moon Monkey. I need a place to display those that don't end in them being broken down for junk.
---
&gt;That still is not telling me how that is different than what I said. And to clarify on the banning portion, I stated that there is no way to prove that he did not do it. Since it would be just his word vs logs that say he got a lot of x items. 
---
Oof, you got me that time, have you ran out ways to try and argue against me. Just give up dude, I said my piece you said yours. It comes down to Bethesda at the end of the day 
---
There's more TSE weapons in the game than atoms in your body. Most players far enough in the game bought a few. Blame the dupers, blame Todd Howard for allowing it for so long. But most importantly, believe in yourself. 
---
And the first?
---
It has two plans for clocks that only it carries, but they're always available for sale. The main draw is that the VBP has several outfits that are only available from it and it's up to RNG whether or not it has them for sale.
---
Oh, well they are 100% still in the game. Get fireproof and a dense torso mod, pretty much negates a lot of the TSE Damage.
---
Sorry for being the odd one out here but I don‚Äôt want everything handed to me. Spending maybe 30 caps to get 1000+ in return from selling seems like a very small price to pay. For the convenience I am getting out of it. You‚Äôll be just fine with 30 less caps, I promise. (I use 30 as an extreme example, very rarely have a paid more than 25 to get anywhere)
---
The 1400 caps? Just sell some garbage to each vendor faction:
---
 [http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/](http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/) 
---
You can also make quite a lot from caps stashes, once you've figured the locations. If you took every search perk then hopefully you have Fortune Finder.
---
Then this might not be the game for you, if you play adventure mode it's as easy as hard as you can get, play at your own pace and do your own stuff. If your completely against the idea of survival and don't want a harsh experience then stay clear of some of the harder activities 
---
It was worth a shot. Good luck finding a good crossbow. I bought all mine at vendors except the double. The ones I really want is a bloodied explosive or two shot explosive.
---
Same problem, for 10 to 14 days now. Got in there once, but I accidently casted a YouTube video to my Xbox so another app opened, by the time I re-openned FO76, it crashed and booted me back to the spawn location of Belching Betty. 
---
They come in explosive?
---
Thank you! That deathclaw has done frustrated me to no end. Least i get decent xp off him 
---
Where are some good spawn points? 90 levels and only seen him once.
---
F
---
You're level 11 and have a full stash? WTF are you keeping? Are you scrapping your junk?
---
Still have yours?
---
Hacking robots will do the same, all buddy buddy for a minute or two then go back to hostile.
---
load time not affected by your preparation  
---
from patch notes:  
---
* **The brief period of invulnerability applied to characters after Fast Traveling or Respawning in Adventure Mode also applies to characters in Survival Mode, and is also removed if the player fires a weapon before the time expires.**  
---
Im telling about not working feature, nothing more
---
I know of 2 spots that I have seen him and a couple more where he allegedly spawns where I haven't seen him. If you are on Xbone I can show you where.
---
Also seeing the time an event has would be great.  It is incredibly frustrating when you travel to an event and it turns out to have just over a minute left so you cannot complete it.
---
I just stick to AWOL Armaments and Uranium Fever because of the guaranteed Legendary spawns.  I will do some Horde events but it depends on the region and enemy type.  For example, Rad Rats are pointless because they usually scale to like Level 26.
---
Doing events in the Forest, the Toxic Valley, the Ash Heap, and even the Savage Divide are pointless at high levels because the rewards do not scale with you.  Why bother other than for the challenges that give you Atoms?
---
No freezes but in the last hour i've spawned into 4 servers w/ SBQ fights and DC'd after 2 minutes or less.
---
Considering that the game tracks what you've found and not found, Bobble head stands and magazine racks, regardless if you still have it  or not, should display bobble heads and mags you've found and/or used in the wasteland. It'd save stash space and show off your in game collection at the same time.
---
Heck, I'm not even an alcoholic(I'm a drunk) and I'm sick of all the drinking based challenges
---
The Giant Teacup event sometimes spawns them in. The event is annoying as hell, but it does spawn in some ants, ticks (for stimpak making), and I've even seen a radtoad.
---
Gtg
---
But the issue is, Bethesda won‚Äôt think to further incentivize doing the events much. They‚Äôll probably give a slight buff and nerf locations like whitesprings to try and force people to do events 
---
OP : Exploding weapons never should have been added. 
---
Gets killed by a bloodied build melee
---
OP: melee should have never been added, there too op! 
---
OP's parents kicks him/her/it out
---
OP: parents should have never existed! 
---
  ^ this, so you would cease to exist. 
---
Cool cool
---
I see.....
---
Well, it's a good thing I didn't have plans today. I read that all wrong.
---
Oh yeah uhhhhh oh super mutant uh over uhhhhh there ahhh *plop* oh uhhhhhhh there's another one *ploop ploop plop* uhhh ahhh target down.
---
I‚Äôve been feeling this too. The framework is there for these events to be worth it, but they really aren‚Äôt. Line in the Sand, a super fun event especially with a group of people. The rewards for it aren‚Äôt really worth it. Maybe an Assault Rifle drop, Grenade Launcher or Fusion Core, couple cases of Ammo, but nothing you can‚Äôt just get from doing anything else. In my opinion events should have much better drops, like legendary drops. 
---
What I would like to see is events with specific drop pools. Line in the Sand should almost always reward players with a one star legendary with a rare chance of a two star and really rare chance of a 3 star, but also a chance to drop a bad drop like two fusion core and ammo. Bots on Parade, and dropped connection drops Enclave specific gear. A chance for  legendary Plasma weapons, and legendary Enclave armor, again with low chances of two to three star drops but also low chance for an unimpressive drop. 
---
I feel like this would work especially well with the upcoming Legendary vendor update and it would also allow balance to come to the game. As others have pointed out the damage has been done with dupers and many people still have duplicated weapons. Opening up the access of better gear and weapons to everyone would overall benefit the game 
---
"STOP TALKING CRAZY!  HAHAHAHA"
---
How much time between nuke waves?
---
3 hours 3 minutes, plus however long it takes to run the silo.
---
I found one of those on a vendor in Whitesprings from another player, grabbed it because it was like 200 caps and wanted to work on challenges with crossbows....it's kinda fun...and sometimes I've been able to recover both bolts if it killed in 1 shot.
---
Yeah I'm new too and having this issue as well. I am level 14 and I'm at max stash as well. Now I have heard bulking junk is a good way to lower the weight in your stash but I'm not really sure it helped me much. I am very much a hoarder. I want one of everything in the game, one of every gun type, one of every armor type etc.
---
I think this ultimately is the problem, I think junk overall when you scrap and/or bulk it, doesn't way very much. However all clothing/armor and guns weigh a shit ton and basically it seems you really can not be a collector in this game. Just store your favorite guns and clothing/armor and that's it.
---
Logged out about 20 minutes ago, they were up, but slow. Weapons not doing damage, couldn't harvest some items, took forever to register I'd placed an item in my C.A.M.P./Workshop.
---
Mine holds my 2 liter bottle for me and unzips my shit for me. Even shakes for me when I'm done. So I dont have to take my eyes/hands off the game. When its his turn to play, I do the same for him. Priorities man. Priorities.
---
It sounds like you need to tweak your build a bit, which is normal around that level. You‚Äôve probably been taking whatever you need to stay alive/do damage and carry more. 
---
Suggestions: 
---
1. Take at least 2 points of White Knight. Your armor will last longer and cost less to fix. 
---
2. Max out Fix It Good and Armorer, swap them in when you mod or fix armor, you‚Äôll fix it to 200% and access better mods.
---
3. If you‚Äôre a rifle build, max out gunsmith and keep it on, your weapons will last longer. You can swap it out if needed, but keep it on unless you need the space for other crafting. 
---
4. Max out Weapon Artisan and swap it in when fixing weapons to repair to 200%. 
---
5. Max out Power Patcher and swap it in when repairing power armor. If you‚Äôre in PA all the time then consider keeping it on, it will make your PA more durable‚Äîbut just swapping it in will reduce repair costs. 
---
The Crossbow in FO4 had a butt load of mods and such for it iirc, or that might've been a mod I installed for it....either way it was fun in FO4...
---
Eh? Not once did I say legendary weapons weren't legit. Wtf are you on about?
---
" Your fault for wearing power armor lol  " -
---
\-what does it mean? power armor provide more defense , and i mentioned it just to note that even it not prevent from almost instant kill against legendary weapon.  
---
" Your fault for spawning at the same place to be camped "-  
---
\-patch notes : **The brief period of invulnerability applied to characters after Fast Traveling or Respawning in Adventure Mode also applies to characters in Survival Mode, and is also removed if the player fires a weapon before the time expires.**  mb i understand it wrong, but i shouldn't be damaged
---
Thank you for being a fantastic human. &lt;3
---
Just got about 5 new outfits from him
---
Yeah, I've also been getting it when using TAB to close treasure maps, and more frequently on loading screens after traveling around for a while. Looks like some sort of access violation, heap corruption or stack overflow.
---
Well I'm going to have to look up all the impact resistance and hot/cold weather defenses of my clothes and write them down somewhere because they are off the edge of my screen... 
---
We are bound together by an ever increasing web of friend lists that pull us in to servers with known folks. I also random into servers where I recognize plenty of names that I absolutely have no relations with whatsoever, but I recognize them just from playing. There absolutely is a community. 
---
Exactly. With a game with this much potential for community/player interactions and events, it‚Äôs insane to know that there isn‚Äôt currently any playerhub.
---
I feel for you bro! I use the same tactics in regards to dealing with my in laws.
---
No, I scrap junk. I've got one weapon, one power armor chasis, a few grenades, mines. Everything else is pretty much broken down crafting materials and food that doesn't expire.
---
There should be an area on the front lawn where players can buy shop space and offer their items to other players, like a farmers market.
---
No need for turrets when you have an army of SentryBots and Assaultrons patrolling your front lawn. 
---
But I like living in Flatwoods...
---
you need to sell more shit then. You can sell to 7 different vendor factions(more like 5 at your level). Some people will buy your food such as dog food here on reddit.
---
Pick the Crushinator
---
As long as you say "no homo" before and after üòÇ
---
Power armor is useless in survival. The lack of legendary effects and the multitude of armor piercing effects/perks negate the benefit of its high DR. 
---
Please no. I fucking hate limited rewards just because you don‚Äôt have to work or have all the time in the world. That‚Äôs why I quit diablo 3 because of that bullshit.
---
It certainly affects mine!!
---
Oh wow. I know this is way more than a simple recipe + effects addition, and it's not likely to happen, but that would be so incredibly cool.
---
Hi, I saw this comment some time ago and have been searching for this safe. Can you please give me a better idea where to find it? Thanks!!
---
A tesla rifle makes it easier to tag the ants at the thunder mountain substation. You can sometimes just fire it at the ground where you think the ants might be if the game is still loading and it will tag the ants before the deathclaw smashes them.
---
The only TSE you cant get anymore are energy weapons. They removed the explosive effect from energy weapons until they can figure out the projectiles. They basically shot regular bullets, and from what my friend told me, they have ridiculous range.
---
Seems fair.
---
But humans are rarely fair. ü§î
---
Also when player vending is introduced if the vending machines were in there besides at camps it would make player vending so much better. 
---
I've seen a lot of talk about AA legendaries lately, are they really that good? Been sitting on an AA Auto Grenade Launcher for a long while, never really tried it out on actual tough enemies, but I haven't really been too optimistic about using it ever since explosives were nerfed. Would be lovely to know I've actually got a pretty decent weapon on my hands.
---
If you don't want the workshop why are you there when a player is contesting it in the first place? 
---
Ah, okay. I guess non perishable food/drink is what's hanging me up. I wanted to hold onto that until I have lead belly later on. Thanks for the advice.
---
But a raider can look like anybody.
---
When I rocked up there was a shitload of lvl 60+ ghouls raping all the security... Think someone must have dropped a nuke before I logged in.
---
You can sell up to 1400 caps with vendors every 20 real life hours, each faction has same caps so it‚Äôs best to sell to multiple factions 
---
Here‚Äôs a map for all the different faction vendors:
---
I've had similar experiences. I just tune my pipboy to the radio and it stops. I think it's playing a halotape because I recognized what they were saying from a previous quest.
---
I finally downgraded to level 2 gladiator perks so I could add incisor.  Only took me 6 levels!  My meat hook went from 281 base to 268, hopefully it'll be worth the grind.
---
Are u sure the second effect is radiation damage? I've seen radiation resistance.  And weapon weight reduction  exist, as well ammo , junk,  food/drink/Chem weight reduction.
---
Ive got 4 250c each if you can come to me. IGN Thom76
---
that stuff is heavy. There are perks to make it weigh less, but those only work on food you have on you and not in the stash box.
---
That was a mod yeah. Crossbows Of The Commonwealth. 
---
Coming now
---
Agreed! Shrugged off the first week of alcohol related challenges assuming it was just due to the new crafting stations. It has gotten ridiculous though. 
---
Yeah it's very self sufficient on ammo usually. 
---
I love this idea so much
---
I think a few small changes would help
---
* Timers on the map next to the event title  
---
* Hover over the event and it tells you what goals have been completed  
---
Just those two alone would help greatly. I tend not to travel to events if people are already there because it might just finish before I show up.
---
* If a plan drops from an event, you have a higher chance of it being a plan you haven't learned (as long as you don't have all the plans from the pool yet)  
---
* If a weapon/armor drops, it should always have a chance of rolling a legendary version. Maybe not even 2 or 3 star, just a one star drop. Especially with the legendary vendor coming.
---
It says +25 radiation resistance
---
This is actually a really smart way of doing it, so that way you can use the magazines instead of putting them away to gather dust, this would have people still trading them and not hoarding them aswell. It would be like unlocking a new character on your magazine rack, once you read the magazine it appears on the rack but it‚Äôs missing that magazine until you do so.
---
I think they can hear your  CAMP radios, like you can gear all radios in the world.
---
Press X to auto-walk your encumbered ass in the direction of the nearest workbench or train station while you pee.
---
The raider PA is a random encounter.
---
Got ya. And thanks for mentioning that players can buy from others, I didn't know that. I should probably read up a bit more on basic functions like that. I appreciate it.
---
In the beginning you‚Äôll be tempted to keep every gun you find. Don‚Äôt do that. Keep what you use, maybe a backup or two, scrap the rest to learn mods or sell them to vendors. Same with armor. The things you‚Äôre collecting now will be worthless to you once you‚Äôve leveled up. 
---
If you‚Äôre storing power armor pieces, waiting for the day you can use it, don‚Äôt. You‚Äôll get good PA later. Vendor that stuff. 
---
Go through your ammo and pull out all the missiles, mini nukes and 40mm grenades. Unless you‚Äôre using them, drop them. They‚Äôre really heavy and no one will want them. This will probably cut a lot of weight. 
---
Read all your plans and recipes, drop, give away or trade the ones you already know. Every 4 weighs a pound, that‚Äôs a lot. 
---
Scrap all junk. Go through your stash and pull out all the junk you didn‚Äôt scrap and then scrap it. There‚Äôs going to be some in there. 
---
After it‚Äôs all scrapped, go to a tinkers bench and bulk anything over 100 of any component. Sell that bulk to vendors. Don‚Äôt keep it, bulking doesn‚Äôt reduce weight. I know people argue about that, but it doesn‚Äôt and you just don‚Äôt need that much crap in this game. 
---
Some scraps don‚Äôt bulk, those can be sold to vendors as is. Sell anything over 100. 
---
As you play you‚Äôll find a few components you want more or less off, but 100 is a good basic guideline. 
---
Hoping to never hear that in my headphones...
---
I'm fairly certain I saw one at Camp Venture the other day.  Maybe in the secure storage area.  Not 100% on the location but it's worth a shot.
---
I want this to be the game for me too, but I understand what you're saying. I may never get to be a high level player like most of you, but I've learned a lot by reading lots of the Q &amp; A you all put out here. So thanks for that. üòä
---
I keep suggesting they have Vault 76 be the first hub and that there be multiple hubs that are purely social / trade zones. whitesprings makes sense as one of them. 
---
Their loss, your gain. As someone who always needs gears, I really hope they dropped them on purpose. 
---
Happy crafting! 
---
I have them trying to claim it about 2 secs after I just did.
---
I love my explosive gatling plasma. Its so fun. Hard to track bullets to see where your aiming. They have ridiculous range and bullet speed too. The plasma weapons benefit the most from the explosive perk in my opinion beacuse the bullet speed of them normally is so slow.
---
If this isn‚Äôt a troll post....
---
How about an alarm clock on the pip boy so you can favorite the events that you want to join. Then get a notification for the events just like fashnate 
---
Nice. Everyone has to start from somewhere, right? I‚Äôll check out your channel.
---
Caution, you risk getting dehydrated.
---
Todd did say in an interview before fo76 was released that the game would change overtime and it would get to a point when it wouldn't be the same as it is when released.
---
That could mean any number of things, but I'm hopeful for some big world changing events and quests.
---
Got ya, thank you.
---
Was it green or was it black with horns?
---
my first time in las vegas i had already gotten all trophies on ps4 for New vegas, we went there by car during a trip to the states and i was astounded by the fact that the road we took had all the cities you usually take if you follow the story, everything felt so familiar yet so different, but it was the first time i had ever felt something like it, im not from the united states so anything that looks like the states in games already feels like a fantasy setting to me, but any place of a game you definitely love seems like a good idea to travel to :)
---
Great info, thank you. I do already have calibrated shocks on my T-60 legs and want to keep rockin' the T-60 suit.
---
Is anyone else concerned about the fact that Whitesprings is being turned into a type of player hub as well as being the most popular nuke site? Just seems like conflicting interests to me.
---
Probably just someone cleaning out. I drop or give away unwanted legendaries, extra junk, etc pretty often
---
/rmarket76 is a good place to sell to others
---
I can. Took me f***ing forever to unlock it by scrapping. 
---
Thanks for explanation, should reconsider my equipment. Still feeling sad about legendary influence
---
There should be a bluebook for legendarys
---
I died for the first time (ok that's fine like how you said, it's part of the workshop. the problem is --&gt; ) then I chose the give up workshop option which is next to the respawn/revenge option and basically fast travel away from that area. Then he showed up again and again no matter where I went ,and can always one shot me before I even spawned in. I really don't think this is part of the "game's rule" in this case....
---
NICE! My first game in survival and your game takes so long to load that I'm instantly dead as soon as I load in cause someone has already killed me and burned thru half my stimpaks as well. Nice job fucking us on camped spawns and "extending" the invincibility time. What the actual hell. 
---
now throw the 3 at the same place and pray?
---
Funny enough it wasn't the bobby pins that really threw me.. it was the pencils. Those were always a good zero weight lead source. I didn't notice their weight till I added a weight tally mod and noticed I had something like 5 pounds of pencils.
---
Lol ofc... Still,  door's always open üòÄ
---
Survival is literally unplayable with limited spawns. People just camp them all. Wtf kind of idiot thought that was necessary? 
---
Hahaha haven't tried that yet. Bethesda doesnt have the servers for it
---
Yup. Not rare legendary. Pretty cool still. 
---
I‚Äôm wondering if they‚Äôll all be connected like an auction system or if each person‚Äôs will be unique and people will have to come to your camp to access the things you‚Äôre selling. That will determine a lot of that for me. In WoW, for instance, which is an auction system, I look at what other ppl are charging and try to beat that by at least a little. The other way would make it harder. You‚Äôd need to keep your camp in a high traffic area if you want to sell things. And you‚Äôd need to come across other camps to get an idea on pricing.
---
I wish I had that problem lol, the guy is so annoying.
---
Okay are you going to save up 23k for your mutation or buy it for a duper for 150 caps? Don‚Äôt tell me you buy it from some one selling it legitimately, because anyone who can make the Serum probably bought the plan from a stack from a duper. All just one big circle, get use to it.
---
I'm basically going to head around and view what's the going rate then undercut by 10% 
---
I've had my place set up ready to turn in to a trading post since before this was even announced haha. 
---
My bottom floor is set up like a garage with all the crafting stations ready and available then you head up stairs and it's basically a bar inclusive of portables and fridges and other misc items to give it that vibe. I'll have the vendor set up behind my counters next to my Nuka girl statue. Then over in the corner is a small amount of accomadation and amenities. 
---
I'm so excited because this is what I set my base up for from the beginning and I will finally be able to do it. 
---
Terminal entries.
---
What plat form do you use I know how to make them
---
what was in the areas of overlap? anything good?
---
This is perfect advice. 
---
/u/lonevaultwanderer
---
/u/ladydevann
---
This is a pretty simple way to trick someone into instant death and seriously needs to be dealt with
---
I always thought that the train stations should be free to fast travel. However, you should have to be at a train station to be able to travel for free to another one. The intent of charging to fast travel is to force walking which in turn creates random encounters. However, not having this travel system tends to make players accept they will have to pay no matter what so they fast travel from anywhere and walk less.
---
Here's some short and to the point one word feedback for each event I've done so far:
---
* Death Blossoms: Boring.  
---
* Dogwood Dieoff: Boring.  
---
* The Messenger: Stop.  
---
* One Violent Night: Yay!  
---
* It's a Trap: Pass.  
---
* Breach and Clear: Why.  
---
* Distant Thunder: Cool.  
---
* Line in the Sand: Sure.  
---
* Back on the Beat: Ugh.  
---
* Feed the People: Yum.  
---
* Bots on Parade: Okay.  
---
* A Real Blast: Kaboom.  
---
* Dropped Connection: Alright.  
---
* Surface to Air: WHAT  
---
* Fasnacht Parade: Classic.  
---
* XYZ Horde: Pointless.  
---
* Battle Bot: Keycards.  
---
* Grafton Day: Maybe.  
---
* Protest March: No.  
---
* Collision Course: No.  
---
* Census Violence: Eh.  
---
Huh, looking at that list, this game has a LOT of public events. Maybe a little less breadth and a little more depth going forward?
---
So reduction is not a rare legendary cause  this is the first time I found it
---
Also, *Luck of the Draw* and *Lucky Break.* I put one point into each (along with rank 5 *Gunsmith* and rank 3 *White Knight*) and I rarely have to manually fix my equipment anymore. They degrade so slowly that even the minor repairs are enough to keep them in good shape for a long time. If you max out all four of those perks you probably won't ever have to worry about it again.
---
yea thats what im thinking sounds too baity
---
*I'll do base price for common plans (or what i perceive as common).
---
*Others that are rare to find outside of a vendor will be priced somewhere between the base value and the vendor asking price.
---
*ultra-rare plans that cannot be found at vendors will be priced at (what i perceive to be) the player market average.
---
Legendary stuff will be what i believe to be a fair price, but honestly most of these are being saved for the legendary vendor, my most anticipated feature. 
---
on this week's episode of troll or idiot...
---
I put a cement block under water hoping that I could put the dome statue on top of it, well I couldn‚Äôt, now the cement foundation is stuck and I can‚Äôt remove it. 
---
I would like to be able to place/remove things in/ under water. 
---
Some challenges can just straight up bug out, this might be one of them. When I learn cooking recipes, my count doesn't go up, and a few of the discovery challenges (finding world locations) are bugged as well.
---
It‚Äôs rare, and they stack. I have 4 pieces so far, my weapons are all super light now, and I can carry dozen of them 
---
There certainly needs to be more incentive for doing events. They should be more profitable for one, because fast traveling halfway across the map already spends 20, even 30 sometimes with 30% reduction perk. And finishing the event will probably net you 10 caps back? Sure, enemies can drop a measly amount of caps, but a big payday is much more significant than 2-5 caps taken off the occasional enemy.
---
I don't think every event should always guarantee legendaries or legendary spawns, there should be *more* but not every event should be about the legendaries. Some events could involve rare recipe drops, big cap paydays, rare materials (think corpse flower seeds, but with actual usefulness). Some should even give cosmetic drops. What's more, the loot tables need to be defined and posted somewhere--data mining and experiments should not have to be necessary for the community to figure these things out. Percentages aren't necessary, either; just knowing that there's a possibility that X will drop from this event should be enough.
---
Are y'all so poor that you can't bear to part with a handful of caps to go do an event?
---
Its not solely about just selling to the vendors, but creating a place for players to gather and meet. The free fast travel is just another an encourager to go to the hub. 
---
Maybe so, but anecdotally the Targeting HUD for the X-01 is not.
---
Awesome, thank you very much!
---
Take over the open air market in Lewisberg ... and hope no ash storms.
---
Well nukes do not effect the interior so if you could fast travel inside of the resort its no big deal.
---
AAE handmade with Sentinel assassin armor will wipe the floors with your sliver of health. I love cleaning up Bloodied builds in PvP because they use to always try to wreck defenseless players before Survival mode when you had to initiate with them and they could be all close like they wanted to start with. You make me laugh. I eat pieces of s*** like you for breakfast 
---
https://youtu.be/CF62YlbmxBI

Gamermomover50 had this video on how to spawn him in.
---
I get that seeing things revolve around alcohol can make it difficult for a recovering alcoholic. Like you said, there is nothing wrong for using some fictional alcohol and drugs to gain temporary buffs but when the whole Atom farm challenges revolve around them...I can see the difficulty.
---
Even I believe they're a bit excessive when it comes to alcohol challenges. I woukd understand the first two weeks, since the brewing was a new thing they wanted to feature, but now I want different things. 
---
Kinda wish they gave more interesting challenges for Atoms...like, for those who use stealth, making a weekly challenge to "make friends" with a random creature.
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
---
Especially when they seem to be so convoluted. Being "drunk" only lasts like 2-3 minutes with most alcohols. I have to fuckin' speedrun in order to kill 25 enemies while drunk on Cranberry Moonshine.
---
Chill, Bethesda. Biv ain't going anywhere and completionists will still want all of his recipes.
---
True, but if they don't do that it's gonna be a pain in the butt
---
Food is easy to get. Just hold what you need as needed.
---
This will change in the next major patch (patch 8), i believe. They are adding one of each vendor to whitesprings (except the enclave obviously) and they will all share the same 1400 cap pool. But im not sure when patch 8 comes out. 
---
Fuck.....
---
Now I have to get all new cards... I'm already leveled. I never realized that...
---
Areas were pretty small, remote as well so nothing of notable value. 
---
Maybe 500-800 caps
---
With the levels on items, it is stupid to hoard that low level stuff since it is useless.
---
No worries. I really appreciate all of your insight, most aren't so willing. I'm on PS4, yourself?
---
Can you elaborate a little, your friend got banned for speaking about duped weapons 
---
Perhaps one per region?  Vault 76 can be for The Forest and Whitesprings for the Savage Divide.  The other vaults may be used, but one is already in the Savage Divide and another is barely in The Mire.
---
Just place the stash box. Create an anchor, and then build slowly. Maybe create a new character. 
---
You don‚Äôt need a mega pad for your CAMP to look good. 
---
Is duping still happening? I haven‚Äôt played since December due to disconnects, camp glitches, and stash limit. trying to work out whether it‚Äôs worth casually having fun on the game again 
---
Although it might not awnser thoses questions specifically, i recommend looking Jug Ross videos on Youtube.
---
As for the blueprint, that feature may be usefull to someone regularly moving camp around. Also usefull for workshop.  But it has nothing to do with running out of mats.
---
Your camp won't suddly vanish because you don't have enough mats. What you build stay where you build it and you are free to go collect more mat and come back.
---
I‚Äôd send them a message and let them know you friended them. The notifications don‚Äôt always pop up 
---
I hope this works for you
---
Im not 100 percent sure, but I have seen people with lots of rare items. Regarding if it's worth playing that depends one why your looking to get out of it. For me I'm only playing off and on until the add the new quests and over content in the coming weeks. Once they come out I will be investing more time into the game. I was hopeful about survival but the mode was dead from launch in my eyes. 
---
I had one roaming my camp at one time. Found it north of Abby's Bunker. At the crashed vertibird random encounter site.
---
Radsinthe 
---
I found him near the overseer's camp a couple days ago. I was farming a couple other locations but I never saw him there. Sometimes they wouldn't spawn anything, but I don't know if that was him bugging out or some other issue. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRP02uM6hIc) shows a bunch of spots to look for him. The odds of that particular encounter spawning are pretty low, but it's definitely still out there.
---
I've no idea how many legendaries or random junk and ammo I've just dropped somewhere because I didn't need, want or use it.
---
It sucks they haven‚Äôt included this an an option on the XBox Version yet
---
You're right. Also to mention, I been buying lottery for last 10 years and I never won a jackpot. This is absolutely unacceptable and I think powerball should increase their drop rate. I mean win rate. Winning chance? whatever fuck the government
---
Yeah that's where I've been grinding. I've only found level 20 ones so far
---
That deletes the risk of taking workshops entirely.
---
Workshops aren‚Äôt free resources.
---
It‚Äôs a grind man, if it was easy to get you wouldn‚Äôt play.
---
This is actually a good idea!
---
He got banned for posting a video about duping.
---
Then he got more than 40 messages telling him about how much of an awful person he is.
---
All three star legendaries are relatively rare, and weapon weight reduction is a really good effect. The first two effects here are also good, at least if the rad resistance works on that piece. It's a bit buggy for some reason.
---
It doesn‚Äôt seem lame that I‚Äôve been playing since the beta and never had a decent drop?  I started playing day 1.   Nothing decent has ever dropped for me.  I can‚Äôt be the only one who feels this way.
---
I think there's still a dupe out there that's kept very quiet in a closed loop. You seen the marketplace lately? Selling over 25k shotgun shells over 24 hours, same people repeat postings over numerous days of the same item even after selling (Explosive rifles/X01 mods) even the explosive lasers going around. One got sold, after that more an more started to "appear" on the market? Nah.
---
I 100% believe people are still duping
---
I‚Äôm not saying easy.  Nothing in my post said anything about making it easy.  But since day 1 of beta, I‚Äôve never had a decent piece of gear drop.  I bought all my good weapons.  
---
Should cancel fast traveling and make more random funning events on the way.
---
everything that can spoil is spoiling faster.
---
That's odd. When I find a deathclaw it's normally losing to the ants.
---
Just chuck a grenade in there maybe?
---
What's the best piece you got so far?
---
I‚Äôm not saying that they are or should be. I fully expect and welcome pvp while owning a workshop. There should still be a way to ditch one without leaving the server. 
---
Id love to come take some stuff off your hands. Ill be on tomorrow sometimes. Ill hit you up gt fanatictexas335
---
I think they took the college idea of it and made the dailies similar to a college hazing. Get drunk, do stupid shit. I'd rather they have added random frat-style pranks around the map to mix it up (it'd go with the theme of college row, too).
---
That would be much more interesting.  Pacify 10 molerats or kill x amt of enemies while concealed.  Everyone can do this.  You don't need a specific build, just swapping in a single rank CHA whisperer card and hitting up areas rich with mole rats, or a measured approach to complete a stealth challenge.  
---
Shit, I was stomping around a Whitesprings nuke in my X-01 suit (ditched the hazmat a while back) and took out probably 75% of the ghouls while in \[ caution \].  Definitely MUCH easier to maintain stealth in my regular armor, but it's not impossible while wearing power armor, even without a stealthboy chest mod.  If there was a stealth kill challenge, you could have any build, pick up a rando gun of any kind, make a handful of ammo and kill the lvl 1 bots around Vault 76.  Mission accomplished.
---
If I was to guess, there might be some in the same update with backpacks. Since it's boy scout themed.
---
Oh not ur camp bruh i mean in harpers in general..no stash boxes
---
The mirror ball plans are exclusive to Graham.  The flamingo plans, I believe you can pick up at Whitesprings... I know all the plans you're looking for &amp; I can build them for you, if you want. 
---
They will be able to kill you anywhere. If they contest your workshop, they will become marked hostile to you and vice versa. Once you are killed (by them), if you don't choose to get revenge, you will no longer be marked as hostile toward them and (in the new patch) they will be unable to hurt you. If one of you leaves the server, you will no longer be marked hostile to each other. I have claimed many workshops and have only had them contested a few times and I've only been attacked once.
---
Balistic fiber is not that hard to find in the wild. Radio towers and others miliary building have some. Well, if nobody pick it up before you do.
---
Look for ammo bags and military grade scotch tape.
---
The following list most or all locations and i hope it's not too outdated :
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a4r1sh/at_long_last_a_list_of_ballistic_fiber_locations/
---
I'm hella ready for the back packs
---
I think I got the lawn flamingoes and gas sign from claiming workshops but they‚Äôre rare. I‚Äôve seen the mirror ball on Graham. His inventory changes so it‚Äôs just luck to find him when he‚Äôs selling it. I may have seen it on other vendors too. Not sure.
---
I guess it would have to be this bloodied grenade launcher.  1 star.  But using it is suicide unless you‚Äôre out in the open.  I‚Äôm just gonna sell it.  My TSE Handmade &amp; my TSE Gatling Plasma I bought from a player.  
---
Ill try and catch you when your on
---
Bulking is a bit of a myth. Other than by consuming your precious plastic, most materials weigh the same after bulking. The exceptions are aluminium and lead, which are half the weight when bulked for some reason.
---
You can store a lot more armour by modding it with ultra-light, although that's tough now that the vendors don't sell the plans.
---
Imagine the power of triangulating fast travel with 3 free points.
---
*enraged Fo76 player as it was a limited time event item*
---
Jeez your right
---
&gt; which is why you see so many people acting like duped weapons isn't such a big deal in the sub.
---
how are duped weapons in a PVE co op shooter a issue? 
---
He posted a video showing how to dupe or just speaking about it
---
From what I‚Äôve read up on, it‚Äôs because how easy it is to penetrate through power armor with a few perk cards like Tank Killer. Doesn‚Äôt help that armor isn‚Äôt equipped under power armor or power armor pieces can‚Äôt have legendary effects 
---
The names of the plans are ambiguous. There is a non functional decorative only stove I believe under your appliances tab. I think you bought that.
---
Referring to the good drops being easy to obtain. Just have to keep at it.
---
Yeah goblin one sucks I drop all  most of mine because I had so many... now the giant mask uuuuuuuuuuhhhhh dawg that's a rare one, people will pay 25k for that
---
Flamingo and Sign I bought at white springs I beleive. They aren't super rare.
---
Idk, I feel the CAMPS are pretty good where there at now, but I understand the part about more assets because I would love to see a update where they add the Nuka Cola display stands and other display stands for things like weapons and teddy bears, along with mounted heads.
---
This statement is correct
---
&gt;I've been doing just fine with a legit sniper rifle that I crafted...its not even a legendary.
---
i call bullshit on that ,mirelurk queens sbqs super mutant warlords and other bullet sponges eat ammo like its nothing 
---
&gt;No they aren't, anyone who thinks that is just trying to rationalize and justify their duped crutch.
---
theres nothign to rationalize about going to want to go threw 3k bullets per sbq fight instead of 6k  + durability 
---
&gt;Maybe you meant to say they're necessary if you want to make everything trivial.
---
im pretty sure at this point that you don't do any sort of end game content cause sbq is far from trivial even with a tse handmade that did 1k dmg per shot pre nerf ( i went threw around 2-3k ultracite 5.56 per sbq fight at 1k dmg per shot ) 
---
Where IS the one at Beckley? Spent two hours looking for it, and never found it.
---
I feel you.  It‚Äôs not fun for me either right now. 
---
This has made shotguns FAR and above OP again.   
---
What they really need to do is stop the hop hop hop nonsense. It turns fighting into a cartoon.
---
&gt;The bullet sponge thing is a joke, BTW. That‚Äôs code for I‚Äôm lazy and want to take the easy way out with a duped weapon.
---
thats why nobody does SBQ post nerf and people have been complaining about craftammo76 + durability issues right? :)
---
Im interested in your lvl 35 bloodied handmade and vamp pump shotty. How much for both?
---
Even with that perk that shouldn‚Äôt be a thing
---
The economy will sort itself out really, at first prices will be a mess, give it a month
---
I didn't realize that could happen. But I have 150+ hours in the game and have never had that happen. How common is it?
---
pretty sure hes the dude that is deadweight in SBQ fights but likes to think hes helping
---
I'm  down...gt?
---
My friend has been able to get one or two decent guns.  When something halfway decent drops, he‚Äôs been the one to get it.  
---
I dunno about  ALL players. But for sure the top three and maybe bounties.
---
Make things immersive, you know? Make like... some sort of hub with a board you can get bounties off of.
---
assassin's/-8% damage from players
---
sentinel's/-15% damage when standing still
---
Time that by 5 for each armor piece and you get this dense upgrade on normal armor chest piece that mitigate most of the explosive damage taken. Crazy right? You need these if you want to win any fight in survival mode. Ohhh right... you can't have that cause you are using power armor... yeah too bad. That's Bethesda's work of art right there. Also, Bethesda couldn't stop these god roll armors from being duplicated so they are everywhere. minus your inventory
---
Came on too late.  How did u guys do?
---
PA. It‚Äôs nothing more that a car you spend your whole life working on only see that some one else has made even better. 
---
By now game devs should be putting this option in EVERY game, I'm going to stop buying games without checking to see if hud scale is included I guess.. 
---
Just make it free to fast travel to events.
---
I would be good with this, but more casual players would not. I do like how fast travel is set up in survival... Minus spawn killings
---
&gt;Your arguements is that it just makes stuff easier. Lol no shit. People have killed sbq legit tho, the playerbase survived before the duping exploit was found believe it or not.
---
get a group of people with crafted or non duped weapons and tell me if you kileld the SBQ in time and if you did how much ammo did you go threw +  durability ,ill wait 
---
&gt;the playerbase survived before the duping exploit was found believe it or not.
---
thats why nobody nukes fissure site prime post TSE nerf LOL
---
O man I love the gatling plasma. Wish mine was explosive. Still fun to use though 
---
Congratulations? Can‚Äôt bet on RNG being fair or even, it‚Äôs just luck. Nothing makes his chances greater over yours. 
---
Srsly? you play since day 1 and that's the best drop? Gimmie a break
---
It's always been that way because of how it is coded. When you hit in vats, you teleport first then hit. This means mob has plenty of time to run away before the hits land especially on slow weapons. It doesn't help that you are locked in place after teleport so you can't do that *sticky* melee attacks.
---
They need to code it so that the attack starts slightly before teleporting. 
---
It really shouldn‚Äôt. This game has possibly the most broken PvP system I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
 "I guess you won't be joining on that mission then"  
---
Sounds like you misheard / a misremembering MODUS speaking when an enclave event times out, sounds similar enough that i'm fairly sure. 
---
im pretty sure this ggnerd guy is trolling at this point or is incredibly dense
---
the fact that nobody nukes fissure site prime post TSE nerf speaks for itself
---
Naw I‚Äôd say 1.5k-2k since it has exploding bullets
---
level 20 is the max level of a tamed one. The tameable animals have fixed levels, and the only way to get a higher level version is to have them be scorched.  
---
Or glitch giving you a rad stag. 
---
Or even Rose. I mean is there much point in boosting her broadcast range if she isn't going to give further quests when it suits her erratic whims? 
---
I give out the ammo, armor, and weapons I dont use to lower level players all the time. Sometimes I'll clear out an entire area and drop all the loot at their feet and then bounce. I always tell them to pay it forward. Treating lower level players decently makes the game better for us all
---
&gt; 800 bullets WITH a TSE weapon when it comes to SBQs.
---
those are deadweight numbers son,i used to go threw  2-3k ultracite 5.56 ammo with my 1k per shot tse prime automatic handmade pre nerf 
---
Mind if I ask what the new years eve event was? O remember them posting something about meeting at the bar, but I did and I was the only one there on every server I hopped to.
---
Well, that‚Äôs exactly my point. 
---
&gt; . I want PvP, it sounds fun
---
there are other games if you want to pvp,fallout was never about pvp 
---
The quests the computer gives you. Upon completion you get the rank of general and can get the power armor plans and launch nukes. 
---
Both.
---
Stove is appliace decoration not cooking station
---
That was it. I am sorry about your luck! My first server had all sorts of people at the bar. It was just random people hanging out when the ball dropped. It wasnt an actual event with XP rewards but a social gathering.
---
Yeah, cheaper fast travel would help. But really for me, it's the legendaries. AWOL Armaments, I'd fast travel to that in the middle of a SBQ fight just because it has better loot. Got 2 3* col gutsy in one go, not to mention the 1* super Mutant in the parking lot by the bus anyway. 
---
These events should have mini bosses at the end in the form of legendary creatures. 
---
I actually just found a set of lawn flamingos.  500 caps and they're yours
---
I'm lvl 64 and I just launched my first nuke tonight, I've done everything solo besides some of the beginning back when my friends played.
---
If he ever got a 3 star handmade or something equivalent, I wouldn‚Äôt complain.  But he‚Äôs only had marginally better luck.  A non explosive 2 shot combat rifle or something like that is his most effective gun.  It‚Äôs only a 1 star.  We‚Äôve killed countless 3 star enemies and never get a 3 star weapon.  
---
Sometimes I wonder what‚Äôs going on at Bethesda....
---
Ah okay, I figured that was it. I expected very little and was still disappointed haha. Really love the idea of it though, wish I could have found a server.
---
When will they make it so that you can actually see what your plan gives u lol
---
Oh Rose....I had a few girlfriends like her.  Just stay away.
---
You do have a good idea, though.  Rose exists.  Her voice is annoying like that one girl that won't shut up at a punk show and I'd rather be finished with her, but she could have hub capabilities with a room at the top of the map and a repaired signal beacon/repeater/whatever to guide us to something interesting.
---
If you have full budget like me repair is like 60steel 60wood and 10 of varios other junk kinds. You have those in stash anyway, so it is no so bad. 
---
Never touch anything that display our lord and savior mothman tho!!!!
---
&gt; Gear needs to give a player a small edge at best, not make the gap between a legendary kitted player and a naked player massive
---
this kill all progression in a rpg if they ever implement that
---
&gt;If Bob as a cool build thats focused around eating dogfood and using a rolling pin, he should be just as affective as someone who googled how to be good at fallout 76 and followed the first YouTube video
---
if thsi ever gets implemented the game will die quickly,whats the point of grinding for gear and playing the game if someone who just started playing is just as effective
---
this is one of the most dumbest thing i read today
---
It's a waste of my time talking to you
---
I think the devs are going to be similar to how Ark PvP is and they have displayed it. Such as unnecessary nerfs of workshops, a prolonged dupe detection and TSE Nerf. 
---
On a side not tho and completely random, everyone talked about getting a TSE nerf but don‚Äôt want a bloodied / unyielding nerf. Thats where the PvP gets broken in my opinion. For example, im maxed on rifle perks, my TS the Dragon does 365~ damage while a Bloodied The Dragon is 600~ Damage. 
---
And abandoning the workshops deletes the only fair option for PvP in adventure mode.
---
Workshops would infinitely trade hands.
---
Adventure mode is supposed to have limited PvP. It‚Äôs what makes people question taking workshops, and makes sure people aren‚Äôt taking every single one.
---
Jesus hates you man. RNG god has forsaken you. If you are telling the truth that is.
---
I hope they allow fast travel to the inside. I've died many a time fast traveling and not knowing it was a nuke zone...or just logging back in after a crash on a different server and getting onto a server with a nuke zone...
---
You‚Äôre probably right.  
---
&gt;I'm lvl 64 and I just launched my first nuke tonight, I've done everything solo besides some of the beginning back when my friends played.
---
i fucking knew it LMAO ,some dude who just launched their first nuke tells people that played the game for 200+ hours how things should be done 
---
&gt;The only thing I haven't tried yet is SBQ
---
i knew that from your post alone,go do SBQ with your normal weapons and report and because i feel like being nice i recommend running all the damage perks  and have 10k ammo at least saved up if you don't use a TSE/AAE/BE weapon
---
&gt;and at 50 or more bucks a pop someone made bank off duping.
---
on console maybe,on pc its at least 100-150$ for assassin sentinel set with action point refresh
---
That's quite fine line to walk. If his intentions were to show everyone in the hopes Bethesda would fix it then I can see what he was trying to do. But if he was just using the exploit content to gain viewers or followers then it's pretty shitty. 
---
I've had similar issues on other subs where I highlighted a loophole in a game and got harassed by a group who abused said loop hole and didn't like me sharing their secret. People need to learn to lighten up, specially on these subs.
---
Caninepilot9015
---
got no argument to fire back after exposing yourself that you are a newbie at the game eh?
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
The invite will be there when they log back in. However, they may or may not see it right away. There is not a notification that you received a friend invite when you log in. They will have to go through their friends list and find that you sent them a invite. Then it is like any other friend invite. They can accept or deny the invite.
---
Canimepilot9015
---
Sorry to hear.
---
lag =/= poor game performance
---
Lag in online games traditionally means connection problems(i.e. high ping), whereas poor performance is poor optimization(software), low-spec hardware, or both. 
---
Do you mean you are getting connection issues in these areas, or low fps? 
---
If you mean low fps, yes I get frame drops in specific areas, mostly outdoors. I assume it's because some areas are just poorly optimized, especially areas with long sightlines(like most of cranberry bog, since it is so flat), or urban areas(towns or places with a lot of buildings, like charleston).
---
My rig has an i7 4790k, an 8gb 1080, 16gb ram and the game is even installed on an ssd, but I get frame drops a lot in "busy" areas, even with a lot of post-processing effects disabled in the settings and ini files.
---
No it's just that yer an idiot.
---
Listen if you want to justify duped weapons I don't give a shit because you can't beat the game without em go for it. I haven't needed to resort to shit like that in any game I've played to beat it and I'd bet money that Fallout 76 isn't the one game I need to stop that low for.
---
It's pointless because in a game with a PvP mode, and PvP mechanics...for some absurd reason, you insist PvP is not a thing in the game. You got donkey brains kid,
---
How about this then:
---
"76 is a shit game and ya'll a bunch of dumb cunts for trying to defend a shit game!"
---
\^ If you want I can go down that route and just insult you stupid twats, with nothing to add to the convo except insults.
---
But hey. Fuck me for actually providing cogent statements and arguments to back up my position. Go fuck a cactus mate.
---
&gt; No it's just that yer an idiot.
---
an there we have it,the ad hominem
---
&gt;Listen if you want to justify duped weapons because you can't beat the game without em go for it. I haven't needed to resort to shit like that in any game I've played to beat it and I'd bet money that Fallout 76 isn't the one game I need to stop that low for.
---
you didnt even do sbq 
---
&gt;It's pointless because in a game with a PvP mode, and PvP mechanics...for some absurd reason, you insist PvP is not a thing in the game. You got donkey brains kid.
---
because i played plenty of other mmos that were killed by balancing for pvp?
---
Yes but I have 11/10 and nothing happened
---
With the good with salt perk it last longer but without it everything is spoiling like 80% faster for me. 
---
Honestly, he just ran up to me while i was shooting him with my shotgun and it did no damage to him :/
---
Maybe the Wastelander update will add settlers back or even big settlements. It's been hyped up as being a really big change to the game.
---
Hit up nukes and dragon and plan out a build/perk list for a play style you‚Äôd like. 
---
Make the effort to do events when you see them. The reward can be worth the time invested. 
---
I've watched a few youtube videos. I'll check those out.
---
Log off, log on. Do another commendation if it hasn't triggered.
---
I had this first time around.
---
You can have two players with completely different builds and play styles that are still on a level playing field. Legendaries should be a way to enhance certain builds, not make them borderline over powered. As it stands now in the game there are many different legendary bonuses that synergise well with certain builds, but because one or two outshine the rest, you end up forcing players to use a meta to succeed or lag behind and be unable to complete certain activities. 
---
If they leveled the playing field between all items, it wouldn't remove the grind, if anything it would increase it by allowing players to progress individually. Rather than everyone looking for the same weapons and seeing the market flooded with TSE, anti armour sentinel ect, it would create a more broad situation where you can't tell how a player is set up by wether or not their gun explodes or if they have almost no health 
---
&gt;Stood there for more than 10 minites waiting to see if anyone showed up. Nobody. 
---
Nice to see ppl with good atitude. Gestures like this makes me believe theres still hope out there üòÅ.  Good stuff man. Cheers.
---
I'd like to offer a bit of encouragement, I've never bought into the "you're never cured" line. I'm a former teenage alcoholic/drug abuser--to the degree I don't remember my Junior Year of High School at all. If it wasn't alcohol, it was acid. If it wasn't acid, it was pills from my grandparents cabinet. If all three were available? Yeah, you do the math.
---
Point I'm trying to make is, I've been clean for a great many years--to the degree that right now I have a tranquilizer legally prescribed--one I used to abuse, and there's zero temptation to abuse again. To the degree that I can actually go out with my mates and have a drink or three. 
---
You do recover, you can be cured, it's not an endless battle. Particularly if the meetings you mentioned are a 12 step based thing. What is it, "But Jesus beheld *them*, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible." (Matt 19:26) 
---
I don't much care what belief you subscribe to, be it Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, Pagan, Atheist, etc., through whatever higher power you believe in, full recovery is not only possible, but basically a requirement, else the lie is on their tongue for saying things like the above verse. 
---
Trick is, changing how you think. Changing your values. Your thoughts control your feelings control your actions. 
---
I wish you the best in this, and I hope that one day you (and anyone else reading this) will realize that cloud hanging over you, that little voice in the back of your head saying "just one more/it's only once" can not only be silenced, but can be so utterly destroyed as to never bother you again.
---
you are not the only one that feels this way. &lt;3 
---
It is on the map but you cant take it.
---
K.
---
It's a recent change. The behavior is common enough that I've just stopped talking workshops if I can avoid it. What's worse, it applies to all of the workshop's owner's teammates as well. It seems to be a pretty common tactic to send out random team invites and either get wanted or contest/own workshops just so that new join can be easily killed by actual friends of the person sending the invite.
---
Unfortunately he put in the wrong code, but luckily I had a keycard on me. I ended up launching it instead and we had a great turnout. Thank you to everyone who came! We were able to kill the queen with time to spare. He‚Äôs going to try again tomorrow. 
---
I think nerfing can be quite dangerous to the game and add major side effects. I'd much rather they balance all weapons by bringing up some. No one wants to fight bullet sponges and TSE helped elliviate that issue at launch. With each patch Bethesda will get closer to making the game a diverse playing field for all weapons and builds without one steamrolling ahead 
---
Alcoholism is a disease that lasts a lifetime,believe me.Im "cured" but I fight it everyday.It doesn't go away,it's always in the back of your mind saying..."ah let's just have some drinks this one time"...forever.38 years I've been fighting it,this shit don't help.
---
For a second I thought you were gonna say that you saw a bald dude in a Manta Man outfit punching everything
---
 Power! Get the power! kitaeta waza wo buchikamase!  
---
Nobody is playing cuz the events are trash. I get on, do my dailies and hop off. :/
---
 Power! Get the power! kitaeta waza wo buchikamase!
---
Do you know where it was?
---
I'm completely uninterested in brewing or the new quests... so yeah, not much for me to do either.
---
It's just really unlikely to get the combination of a good max-level weapon with two or more good stars. I think I only found one in 130+60 levels, and that was a weapon I had no interest in using (bloodied deathclaw gauntlet). My main team-mate also only found one (TSE dragon). Oddly enough, both drops were on the SBQ.
---
On the plus side, one good star is plenty, and you find loads of those.
---
gas sign and flamingo plan come from doing defend event. I've had to dump them at whitesprings a few times because nobody would buy them. If you are on xbone i might have one or the other or both for you.
---
Oh exactly, i hope they try to make everything as balanced as possible too, just upsetting when one gets light and another doesn‚Äôt. As for bullet sponges I agree too, a glowing ghoul shouldn‚Äôt take a crap ton of ammo to kill lol. 
---
LOL
---
Did you wait more than five seconds after spawning in?
---
I wish that was what this guy was wearing
---
I'm an atheist for one.  Having no faith makes it difficult, and especially so to find a non-faith treatment system.  There is no higher power for me.  I have a continual, very mild fight with myself every morning not to drink or get some pills.
---
I turned from a straight edge vegan into a full-on alcoholic in my 20's.  I thought I had willpower and a religious sort of restraint as an adherent, but as I got older, many of my beliefs fell apart.
---
I have absolutely no interest in debating philosophy and science.  Suffice to say that I desperately wish I could conceive of a higher power to put my trust in and receive that little bit of relief in kind.
---
It is what it is.  This is not the place for philosophy and science.  We're here to make 76 better.
---
couple things. 1, 3k caps is pretty much nothing. Two...stash your shit if you're terrified of loosing it?
---
It's because you touch yourself at night
---
At that point might be better to start again.  But really comes down to what you have unlocked or have done. 
---
When you see a level 200+ running towards your workshop, bail. Just up and bail.
---
Scrap EVERYTHING.
---
Build your C.A.M.P. near water, always.
---
Junk deposits are worth more than anything else, because gears, screws, and springs are scarce, and you need them for almost everything.
---
Minimalistic approach to C.A.M.P. is the best start.
---
If you find your stash is hitting the limit, SBB. Scrap, Bulk, Build. 
---
Pick up every weapon early on, scrap them to learn modifications.
---
.308 is GODLY early on.
---
Use your hotkeys, they will save your life.
---
Always carry a melee, a close range, and a long range weapon (early on, machete, 10mm, and Hunting Rifle are my choices).
---
Use perks wisely, plan ahead if you can.
---
Caps are in short supply, so hold off buying plans until about level 15.
---
Boiling Water, Firecap x2, Bloodleaf x2, and Snaptail Reed x2. Carry at least 4 Disease Cures on you at all times--use them wisely.
---
Soups are the most efficient food, giving both food and water, while healing.
---
Brahmins can be milked--the milk removes rads, restores health, and quenches thirst.
---
Do not underestimate the power of a pipe weapon early on.
---
Never let yourself get surrounded.
---
Shots from a hidden/caution position deal double (or more) damage--use that to your advantage.
---
The Scorched/Ghouls don't seem to want to jump up to areas hard to get to--use THAT to your advantage (was level 16, taking out level 60+ ghouls because I had a position they couldn't get to).
---
As soon as you can in your C.A.M.P., food. Razor Grain, Corn, Tato, Melon, the works.
---
LOCK YOUR DOORS from the C.A.M.P./Workshop menu--put locks on all your extractors, all your chests, all your doors--the most expensive lock you can afford.
---
When you see a level 200+ running towards your workshop, bail. Just. BAIL.
---
That's about all I've got--that's put me on a good start, I'm right at 24 hours in now.
---
Keep going, its not always possible to complete your build by lvl 50.  You can move SPECIAL stats around after 50 to fix anything you need to
---
Forgive me for trying to offer a bit of encouragement, I'll see to it I don't make that mistake again.
---
Lol my first thought. Probably not. 
---
To some people 3k is hard to come by. Not everyone has mind to accumulate caps like general player base. 
---
Currently have me a Mirror Ball plan sitting in my Stash. If you‚Äôre on PC, I could let it go for 2000c.
---
I don't use PA and have a mostly Vanguard build.  I have a 1 star instigating meat hook that does 270ish base damage.  Incisor ignores 75% armor.  It would reduce your armor by 450 points and do 540 dmg if you are full health.  If not full health it would take 2-3 swings.
---
3 don't go to train stations. 
---
I wonder where they will put them, in an unused room or make a new expansuon?
---
I mean, super early game? Sure. But once you're past level 50? 
---
I‚Äôll help if its not done yet
---
Hey man, that's not what I meant.  I appreciate your response and would like to give you a high five through the wires.  I think addicts of my variety are maybe difficult nuts to crack.
---
Wait I‚Äôm sorry, you bought it for 6 or 7k and now you‚Äôre looking for what someone will pay for it?
---
Your question is unclear. 
---
Yeah, I have to sit there and wait for the list of every quest I have done to scroll by, the server lag to stop, and my camp to load in so usually about a minute at least. Why it has to relay every quest iv done on the screen I dont get but whatever. Point is, every server I have been to, white springs has no robots at all. Not one. And I dont think it's just me as I say another player look around and then leave. If the robots do spawn they dont move or talk. Also, in one server all the ghouls were charred glowing ones like it was a blast zone. I just got into another server and the train stations have vendor bots tho of course they are all broke as usual. 
---
TL;DR I support a nrw player hub, rant about how it'd be a good thing, and wonder if a PvP arena should be apart of it. 
---
With the new survival mode a player hub would be amazing, so far I see the Whitesprings, Charlestown, Flatwoods, Watoga, and The Top of the World being used as player hubs. The problem is none of those places are safe from PvP. I love the new survival mode it's what the game should be, but I hate not having a place where I can enjoy not having to always look over my shoulder. Earlier today I had traded with a guy and we were being friendly, then he tried to kill me so I put him down like a dog, only to get destroyed by another guy with something explosive and automatic. I'm not mad about the loss of caps but I did lose all my junk and a fair amount of aid stuffs. A player hub would likely have prevent something like this from happening. Conversely I see Morgantown and Vault 76 being used as PvP hubs so perhaps a sort of arena could be integrated into the player hub. 
---
It‚Äôs all mindset for everyone. I just hit 5k and I‚Äôm 180+. Not because I‚Äôm bad or whatever.  But I don‚Äôt really care to be rich. 
---
People who know what it is pay alot of caps for it, but when I bought the pieces I bought them from people who had no idea what they were actually worth to people so I got them dirt cheap. I'm curious how much it goes for among people who know what it is. 
---
Could be, but I still believe a full recovery is possible. I'm not much of a religious type my own self--I took to heart the Litany Against Fear and the Mentat Mantra (from Dune) to heart.
---
Anyroad, it's nearly 3 in the AMs where I'm at, and I've an early day. 
---
As I said before, I wish you the best.
---
Ok because that wasn‚Äôt clear at all
---
Maybe 2-5k per piece tbh
---
I'm CONSTANTLY charging in to melee and take 3-4 swings that do zero damage to someone. End up getting killed.  
---
People who whined about melee being OP were incorrect in the first place. Now they're all but making melee useless against real skilled players.
---
Are you on PS4? I have no idea how much they go for, how much do you want?
---
no
---
That is a great point for Survival. This will especially come true if they make it so survival no longer allows character transfers from adventure. (This was mentioned as a possibility for Survival after BETA. It was mentioned at PAX as an idea not a solid plan)
---
Unyielding cavalier
---
When in doubt, whip it out
---
Really? The pieces are rare as hell. Like you can only get them the first time you do responder events aswell as doing the first two responder missions. And even then the chance was like .06% chance to drop if I remember. 
---
How do you send them a message?
---
I‚Äôm so glad they‚Äôre doing this.
---
I‚Äôve watched scorched and super mutants stand just outside of range and slowly wear down my walls and plants,   I ended up taking down my turrets because they were useless.
---
Well shit, I revised it so hopefully it makes more sense now
---
Actually gg, hate people who use that now
---
Yeah but I doubt people will pay 25-50k for a set.
---
Will be joining in 5 min
---
When I was getting the set I was willing to give an arm and a leg for it and a good few others were too. I expected for 10k at the least but I'll compare what you say to what others say. 
---
Thanks man.  I appreciate your words and value your time to type as kindness and encouragement. It does mean something to me to share dialogue, even if we can't meet in the middle at the end.  Only a fool discards free advice.
---
The amount of time items last isn‚Äôt worth the effort imo. I use carnivore and never cook anything anymore. Just cannibal and carnivore raw meat if necessary 
---
I'm pretty sure I got both when I did the quest.  How are these rare?
---
If you both have killed countless 3* enemies you have most certainly gotten 3* gear. And it doesn't matter if you have been playing since beta. How many hours do you have in the game? What level is your player? Have you been farming or just exploring? 
---
I am indeed on PS4 üòÅ.  It'd be so awesome to have a Responders team in Survival!
---
High tier foods should be hard to craft. The problem is we don't have fridge to delay raw ingredients' spoilage so most of the time it is pointless to bother with 5 ingredient foods.
---
It would make more sense if we can farm rare ingredients and store them for future use. 
---
Last time I fast traveled to an event it ended the moment I loaded in. Timers would be nice too.
---
There is a low chance (about 17%) in general for one to run into a 2-3\* enemy and getting a 2-3\* drop. Then, that drop is chosen from about 200 possible items, so there is even a lower chance you get the desired weapon/armor.
---
However, there seems to be a way to increase the chances for a desired legendary effect or item type by stashing such items, even if you don't have use for them. Keeping them in the inventory also works. 
---
I also suggest farming Watoga and Harper's Ferry.
---
When I realized it could only be gotten through the quest and I had dumped it on my main ages ago I just jumped on an alt and sped to that quest, pretty easy so I certainly wouldn‚Äôt pay to buy it personally.
---
You're talking about the firebreather uniform most likely. If it's red it ain't what I'm talking about. The uniform I'm talking about is a white and blue firefighter uniform, I'll post imgur link for reference. 
---
Agree, PC is so much smooth at 1080. But my build and character is better on Xbox 
---
I think you're talking about the firebreather uniform, there's no set quest to get it. It's an event reward basically. 
---
Use vats ..have a good day
---
Yeah, but it's easy to replace. There are items of value in this game that are easy to come by, there are vendors you can sell to and make 1.4 k profit in a day...call it 1.2 if you do a lot of fast travel. Mobs drop caps all the time. 
---
Just because you choose NOT to do it, doesn't make it HARD to do. 
---
I usually get up and get a beverage or hit the head when I server hop.  30 seconds it's usually good to go.  
---
Have you checked r/fo76bazaar
---
I dunno about FT costs. I fast travel to them all the time and still gain caps. However i agree about rewards. Rewards just suck. There should be at least one 3\* legendary enemy per event. Also events should pop up every hour by themselves like Fasnacht did. Not when someone is nearby. You guys can't expect me to walk all over the map just to see if there's event available. And notifications. Fasnacht had one IF you are in the Forest region. We need those notifications for all events. And they should not be limited to the region you are in. I mean in 700 hours i've done "Manhunt" once. Yesterday. I didn't even know this event existed until yesterday.
---
Yeah, red.  Didn't know there was a variant.
---
Git Gud

The imgur link to what the uniform I'm talking about (the white and blue one) looks like compared to the firebreather set and the firefighter helmet. 
---

---
I guess the price might vary on the console
---
It's not, I've fought a couple of people in power armour who were seriously hard to damage. Not sure what the setup was, possibly emergency protocols and damage mitigation perks. Was terrifying! 
---
It's alright, it's a fairly obscure thing
---
I live there. The bot spawns. 
---
I really do like the idea of a radio station. It could be an A.I. that reports on events and other happenings in the wasteland.
---
Beth could whip up some neat lore to fit it into the game too!
---
I didn‚Äôt know of this tanks I‚Äôll check it out
---
Just started the silo
---
There‚Äôs no need to start over, reallly.
---
I‚Äôm level 140, and started as a pure rifleman the first two months and about the mid-40‚Äôs I realized a simple combat knife could be a game-changer. 
---
I started slamming perks into one handed melee and as someone else noted, began to shuffle SPECIAL points and level 65-70 I had it pretty well sorted out. 
---
Now I‚Äôm pretty dangerous with both knives and rifles and feel pretty well-rounded, you can easily do this too.
---
Cheers!
---
Do you have the Bandolier Perk?  It sounds like you have Bandolier Level 2, and your ammo is being reduced by 90% when you're carrying it.  When you put it in the stash, it expands to the normal weight (no weight reduction perks affect an items weight in stash).
---
I believe that anti-armor weapons don't deal the right amount of damage and instead of going through armor they simply deal more damage, but less than bloodied. Nobody has thoroughly tested this tho, so I might be wrong.
---
If it's easier to get on PC I'm switching, because it was hell to get on console. I wasted over 12 hours of my life grinding new characters til I broke down and tried to buy it from people. After a month of searching I finally got the full set. 
---
Regular events need to be more rewarding to make them feasible. The parade got so much traffic cause people wanted the masks. If they want events to be frequented they should do what OP says or even make events give more xp. Make events the best method to farm xp and they will get traffic. If they give more caps too then those events will have parade day 1 traffic.
---
You seem to be making some pretty interesting assumptions about "how" the game is "meant" to be "played" 
---
Personally i tend to find that if you can do it then its something that you can do in that game doesn't really matter if someone thinks you shouldn't be able to do it if you can do it you can do it 
---
And also you can use marsupial tactically "no one expects the rooftop inquisition"
---
Are u by chance using a perk card to decrease the weight of ur plasma cartridges, if u are that would be why because perk cards dont work on items in ur stash
---
If you're on PC https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/267
---
Yea. Agreed. As stated I‚Äôm not afraid of pvp. Actually I have never been contested for a workshop, and it‚Äôs not my point.  My point is that you should be able to drop a ws when you are done with it. Without having to waste time hopping servers. 
---
So true!!!! I literally said holy shit to myself when like every other challenge was telling me to drink and I was like ???? Time to get fucked up??? But then I was like that‚Äôs actually kinda fucked and then I realized that this game is actually really creative and made by humans but yes it is a little too much Influence all in your face to be a fallout drunkard but hey I also don‚Äôt mind being absolutely mangled on Chem‚Äôs that‚Äôs fun too :) 
---
The statement checks out.
---
Yeah it would be great if it showed an image of what it makes instead of the folder of it being a plan haha
---
The different containers and all stash in everything is based on server stability so they couldn‚Äôt give us multiple different stashes to store.
---
If only the game somehow indicated on the map where a nuke zone is. IdK like a big, red circle?
---
Oh sorry! Rare event outfits do fetch a much higher price yeah but that becomes based more on desperation, I have generally started farming events for outfits so wouldn‚Äôt pay much, after a few months 10-15k would feel reasonable for the set. I wouldn‚Äôt pay more since there are so many good outfits out there and the atom shop keeps adding more. A dedicated collector though may pay a fortune if its one of the few currently on the market.
---
you forgot well tuned and i think there are a couple more but yeah they seem to its certainly speeding up my levelling process on my new survival only toon 
---
Ahh, makes sense. At least I know now, still annoys me but I'll get over it. 
---
Also the servers are crashing a lot tonight as well
---
Gt caninepilot9015 silo bravo
---
People that "can't hang" are being one shotted in the leg by rifles in a game where a direct hit from a mininuke won't do that... and most ppl obviously have duped ones man. Pvp needs balancing. This idea might not be it but it feels off.
---
i call my hunting rifle the can opener :P 
---
Except I'm wearing sentinel assassin too and my gauss rifle out ranges your handmade, my perception also means I'll see you long before you see me and I one shot anybody.
---
Yeah...sometimes the map doesn't load them for me sooooooooo...
---
Thanks for that /s
---
For the rare recourses like hardened mass and flux it is shared between players so it has a sort of first come first serve sort of deal on that stuff. 
---
It don't have to prove anything.  
---
People who bought the duped items told me that they  were duped... because the duper told them so.  They bought it from someone who said "Hi! I'm a duper and I will sell you da best guns in the game!" 
---
It's all good, I was wondering if my desperation to get the set was for not when it wasn't even worth much. And yeah that makes sense. Thanks for the advice. 
---
# SUGGESTION
---
You are right...i have the batteries included perk...but with it off each round weighs .03...while i forgot about the perk there must be a typo here as all other ammo types are 
---
.001 to .006 which makes no sense for it to be so heavy per shot...thats what a fusion core weighs with weight reduction...lol
---
It isn't loading fast enough, you are standing there "invulnerable" while in the loading screen. I know because I have spawn camped people. For science.
---
not sure about the hate for juicehead either i can aonly assume that its either cause he is a news channel mostly or that behind the scenes he must enjoy slowly peeling the skin off cats.
---
There will always be a meta unless you make all gear useless 
---
Yeah the travel cost is annoying. I'm such a miser with mah' caps. 
---
Where do you even see the challenges? Never found one. Or are they the Event markers?
---
It isn't also as bad as you think because you're being lit up for like ten seconds while you're loading in, so you literally cannot do a thing.
---
yeah a tank with really decent damage Resistance and the ability to stim pack up every thing you can throw at them in real time is actually kinda scary feels like fallout's version of mr x from the resident evil 2 remake
---
You gotta press start and then it‚Äôs either L1 or R1 on PS4 and then you can select how ever many you want and then they like pop up every time you sign into a world and some of them are available in the pip boy but I think they are working on that.
---
I coukd at least somewhat understand that, ive had it happen with regular items as well though.
---
Its the load times that are using up your invulnerability.
---
If you have radshield unlocked you can use that and normal armor in nuke events and have the same rad resist as power armor
---
The Stealth melee bros are more terrifying! 
---
How much of the player base do you know? About 0.0003% ??
---
Same issue, contracted it several times now but the challenge will not update.
---
I have tried both curing &amp; letting it run it's natural course.
---
Second the gattling plasma - I cleared inside and outside with 2 plasma cores which are SUPER easy to craft. I dont have any heavy weapon perk cards either, stupidly, because these days theyre all I use.
---
Could always make Fasnacht donuts /s
---
They definetly make to input the work in for removing the condition bar.
---
Really? Lmao. It‚Äôs a video game, I used to be addicted to pain pills from my knee surgery and I don‚Äôt complain about every video game ever using them.
---
I vote for a sunless world.
---
Permanent night time sneak attack boost.
---
Yea I think Bethesda must've scrapped it in the patch. I have been looking for this thing for over a month and not once has it appeared in a vendor's inventory or modded to an enemy's weapon. It's just gone. 
---
Here's what you do:   Raise thine baseball grenade up on high, saying, "O RNGeus, bless this Thy hand grenade, that with it Thou mayest blow Thine enemies to tiny bits, in Thy mercy." And RNGesus shall grin and the people shall feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals, and [f](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_bat)ruit bats and large chu---
---
I shall skip a bit...
---
First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin, then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Baseball towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it. 
---
Verily, that shalt please RNGesus, and there shall be much rejoicing when the Drops of the Belt of Orion shall be delivered into thine hands, *even into thine hands,* that the Glory of RNGesus shall be spread, and all those wicked nonbelievers shalt be snuffed verily, in his mercy.
---
Amen.
---
If you‚Äôre on the app (ios) click the three little white dots at the top&gt;user flair&gt;then whatever you want.
---
Id probably pay more for a 2 shot the dragon that I did for the tse combat shotgun(3500 caps).
---
If I were you though, id definetly hold onto it. You'll thank yourself later.
---
Wonder if there's a quad 2 shot dragon?
---
Still running this by any chance?
---
Its not easy. I think the trick is to move fast but you need to know where you're going.
---
&gt;I think we should have increased protection and decreased damage output on power armor.  
---
I think power armor is fine as is.  It gets a bad rap in PVP on these boards.  People love to say 'power armor is useless in PVP.' 
---
I say it's like any other type of armor: useful under circumstances, useless in others. And circumstances or often beyond your control (and that's how it should be). 
---
People don't use PA in PVP because they think it's supposed to make you bullet proof. But PA is not just for damage resistance, but damage output with heavy weapons. 
---
With my power armor, stabilized perk, and an anti-armor lite machine gun  with prime receiver, I destroy anyone that I manage to hit before they hit me.  
---
But sometimes they manage to hit me first and I'm dead. 
---
That's how PVP works, no matter what anyone says: you win some and you lose some, no matter how good you think your build is. 
---
Ok, guess I never looked in the right place. Thx!
---
I might be alone in this, but I really dig the challenge of making higher tier food. Course, part of my character's personality is he's a moonshiner (yay Nukashine!), so sourcing ingredients for food is part and parcel to that.
---
I also took the perks that cause food to spoil 90% slower in my inventory. I end up with so much food I'm giving it away to anyone under level 10 I see.
---
It's a free for all
---
Well just look at it from my point of view here. Bethesda is ok with the items that exist now. Myself, a 63 year old man, whom works 60+ hours a week barely has time as it is to play the game. When people cry out that they want all these items removed, or forced restarts, all I see is my hours, my precious hours going down the drain. I knew Fallout 76 would have PvP elements to it. That's why from the start I used the sparce play sessions to hone my build into a PvP machine. And I want survival's unrestricted PvP. I wanted that from the start. If I can't use my character then I might as well quit the game for good and go to pinochle.
---
I like AA on ballistic guns because it's consistent and doesn't have negative sides. 
---
Two-shot is great, but causes double wear, so your guns break faster. And I don't like fixing guns all the time. 
---
Bloodied will do more damage at low health for sure, but when you meet lots of enemies or stuff like colonel gutsy or super mutant with an automatic weapon, they will melt you like crazy and dying if not fun.
---
Furious will do more damage on enemies that take lots of bullets. But then you often switch, especially when there are lots of enemies that move around, take cover or spawn in the battle. And each time you switch, the bonus resets for that enemy. 
---
But that's all personal preference. All of those will work, it all depends how you enjoy to play. 
---
I've gotten chemist and lockpicking about 5+ times each. I don't understand how I could get multiple copies of cards with only one possible level
---
Well, depending on where you are on the map you do get audible Grafton event notifications.
---
Other than that, yeah, no notifications.
---
But that does not apply to every single person wielding any top tier weapon or armor.
---
You are working under the assumption, that the level 50 is an alt character of someone who has everything figured it out. But we alll answred to a guy who was asking what max level is. 
---
1. Chance of legendary enemy spawning is higher when higher level. My alt at level 50 rarely finds a leg at Westtek, my level 170 always finds a leg at Westtek.
---
2. I didn't figure out how mutations work until level 90-100 of my first character, how to keep them and not making the negative effects come into play. Not everyone reads guides on reddit. Just a few days ago a higher level player asked me at Fastnacht how I could jump so high without PA. 
---
3. Player to player trading, I'm not sure if that really is such a common thing. Not from my perspective, and I don't see it much when I'm playing. in 4,5 months I got asked 3 or 4 times in I wanna trade, and those were people checking my things out, because all they had was shit.
---
The minority of players is active on reddit or on the forums or watch youtubers or look stuff up on google. Most of them just log in to have a little fun. They don't know what is the best route for legendary farming or how to get the best boni stacked with food and drinks and mutations. I don't know all that, and I am reading up on it
---
Therefore I think it is much safer to assume the level 300 before has an advantage over me and could put me in the ground easily.
---
I.m on reddit now while my game has froze. Sometimes if you wait it comes back.This is the 3rd SBQ fight today but this one is situated in the nuke zone and my game can't deal with it.
---
We should absolutely keep getting duplicates, **but** lemme trade lets say 3 or 5 of them to get a new random card if i want to get rid of them.
---
Wait, what vendor has 1000+ caps?
---
You must be referring to travelling to all vendors and getting the maximum amount of caps they can give. This means you must fast travel at least six times. Now, with a good system you may pay 5-10 caps between each travel. But that's at least 60 caps. 
---
Furthermore, this is under the assumption that everyone has 1000+ caps worth of items to sell, which I can assure you is not always the case. 
---
From the first line, I'm gonna assume you think yourself superior to other players because you want the game harder as opposed to easier, not that you'd ever admit as such. So here's the thing to note; you're not representative of every player, hence you being the odd ome out. Too fast travel from Watoga to Grafton for Grafton Day will cost you a LOT, even if you stop at Vault 76 on the way. If you have a camp near Mount Blaire yet wish to attempt tracking the elusive Flatwoods Monster via Queen of the Hunt, you will again incur a hefty fee, which would be far less taxing on your cap purse were travel between train stations free. 50 caps can be the difference between whether or not you get that lovely sofa you've had your eye on for twenty levels, after all.
---
This wouldn't be giving things to your lazy, inferior fellow players, it would simply mitigate the damage to their funds and encourage people to actually walk more, as they'd have more incentive to fast travel for free to a station and then walk to their destination.
---
If you wish to abuse your wallet, then by all means continue. But not everyone is a desperate money-making machine obsessed with staying at max cap limit.
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios
---
I reckon this is a totally reasonable request.
---
Could we rein in the dailies to maybe one drink challenge?
---
10 atoms to ignore isn't as much, and personally i've stopped entirely.
---
Check your perk cards.  Their base dmg sucks but with the right perk cards they are badass 
---
None of the events are worth doing for the event/rewards themselves. Only the legendary spawns keep me going to the few I do. ServerSurfing is the better option.
---
If they gave us some more events guaranteed to spawn legendaries, id spend atoms to FT to em. As it is, I'm barely interested in the game anymore 
---
Frt: how many times do they expect us to do westek/ws/sbq runs before its boring as hell. I did 60hrs/week of grinding in diablo 2 for nearly a year as a job, and can still fire up d2 for s&amp;g.
---
Barely 2 months from purchase , and I'm pretty much over this one until new content drops (I mean real content, like raid vaults/bosses, not more lameass fetch quests from biv, or the faschnacht robots)
---
Make it a guaranteed 1-3 star legendary depending on the events difficulty in its current state the rewards are mediocre
---
I agree about Feed the People. They may not have intended the event to give stuff to everyone, but it was what made it kinda cool. They really should have just left it the way it was. Completing the event and knowing that everyone else was benefiting from your actions felt really cool. 
---
Im all for it if it doesn't mean i'll get spammed trade and party invites as i cross path with someone like it is now. I want to play along people, not *with* them.
---
So if you add a player hub also add the option to auto decline trade and group requests.
---
Glowing one servers usually means there was a nuke zone but it ended/dissipated before you got there. Be glad for the xp glowing ones produce. 
---
We do events for fun, but to fast travel and interrupt what we are already doing there's not usually enough reason to justify traveling there for the event and traveling back to resume normal play.
---
Haven't played this week at all because of it. Just dropped my opinion of Bethesda they seem to focus so much on this. Is cool its present in the game and a few quests are fine but making it necessary to drink so much so often is just not what I picture a "mature" game needs. 
---
Yeah I got kicked after I launched it 
---
Yes PvP sucks. lost all my aids without knowing what happens. I got a two shot Fatman will come back with 100 mini nuks. 
---
I fast travel to events to discover the location so I don‚Äôt have to walk as far to get places later.
---
Future DLC coming soon, "Perk Card Vendor".
---
Haha but for real, why even have the trading card mechanic of opening packs, if we cant trade?
---
I see the amount of time and effort you put into this post and I like it, duped weapons are usually used by lazy players who just want to get to the top. I hope Bethesda makes a program that detects duped weapons.
---
Happened to me before. If you aren‚Äôt super close to another building, etc, you may be lucky like I was. I moved the camp a few feet over and suddenly I was able to place it again. Of course I placed it slightly awkwardly (since placing a whole blueprint at once is never gives very fine control) but now it‚Äôs rebuilt and maybe only a foot or two from where it was
---
I‚Äôd hang onto it if I were you.
---
It doesn't even have to drop legendary items.  Plans would be nice. And not dropping the same damn plans every single time would be a great first move. 
---
Doing the BOS event "Distant Thunder" gets me T60 and T51b  motion assisted servo plans every fucking time I do it.  Why not plans for calibrate shocks? Or reactive plates.   
---
"Because those items are supposed to be rare/ hard to obtain."  
---
Well, okay.  But being so hell bent on keeping things ultra rare is stripping away  incentives to do events like these.
---
If you are 99 percent sure you aren't going to get the plans you want then why bother?   Sooner or later it becomes an exercise in futility. 
---
Haven't played since release really, and in the past week ive been having a blast. Dudes 100 percent legit and had a ton of great things to choose from. Thanks man! 
---
I have all the rifle cards maxed out. That's the only reason my lever action tse is worth carrying after the nerf. I dont use automatics, only bolt or semi auto. But the weights are still off. I have the rifles all built with the most damage in mind, and armor penetrating as well. A few are anti armor legendaries but for the most part my rifles are level 50 and tricked out. But my .308 and .50 both do the same damage. That makes no sense. The .50 should do at least double what the .308 does. Physics man lol
---
I designed my character to be jack of all trades, master of none. I figured out a stealth sniper, VATS sniper, melee, and heavy build and the mapped how many points in each stat I‚Äôd need to have a reasonably effective version of each.  I then determined modular perk loads.   As an example I can run incisor, martial artist, and blocker with 9 strength.  Or I can swap one of those cards for three shotgun damage perks.  
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one using a crossbow out there! Picked up an AA Crossbow and been in love with it since. ‚ù§
---
I started a new character recently, and I found THREE animated Thru-Hikers.
---
I have a melee build primarily using a lvl 50 all rise with 250 damage. Never got a TSE weapon drop. I know what the meta is I just don‚Äôt agree with it and don‚Äôt believe it is fair
---
I agree.  But keep in mind these weights might be this way in the fallout universe. Metal casting and whatnot might not be as it is in our world. 
---
No parking PA on the counter!
---
I remember world of Warcraft 
---
From what I read two shot and quad exist on the same bracket. So they can‚Äôt exist together. 
---
Fair play I can understand the positive you take from it
---
I play often with a handful of people (whenever ones or more of us is on) and we have different builds. So often times we are on the lookout for each other‚Äôs ideal weapons. I like oddball melee weapons, so I‚Äôm happy to drop stuff they want, and they drop me stuff I want. It works out pretty well and we all just vend out the junky wood armor kind of stuff.
---
It‚Äôs amazing how much nice gear I‚Äôve gotten since we do legendary runs together, since you have almost twice the chance of a decent drop (unless your partner is looking for exactly the same kind of gear)
---
Here‚Äôs the LOL I know alot of you wanted to type when you read this. Got u covered famz.
---
I've had hundreds of extra gear for month, and nothing to burn them on. While with springs and screws I can always craft radium rifles or ultracite lasers, still got plenty of mods to open.(and good weapons for those) Out of the 3, gears is definitely least valuable and needed. I often sell gears for vendors.
---
Someone might had died, and then got disconnected. Bye bye everything. In the 600+ hours I've lost alot of junk that way. And I always store valuable junk but you can still end up playing for like 4 hours without oppoturnity to store stuff.
---
That whitespring ST should not be a place where you can easily die as there's usually nothing there, though. Maybe players fighting and then both disconnecting. I would think if someone wants to drop stuff for others, they would place it into a container, it stays longer.
---
I've heard people nuke places where players can start their game and then die into radiation before they can do anything. But I've never seen bags on the spawning points. Like I've literally never seen Watoga be nuked.
---
Congratulations, this is the only sensible comment in this entire thread :) The duped weapons don't have the correct legendary effects for PvP due to the weird damage system it uses. It's difficult to know how much sentinel was duped and sold, it's still very expensive on the trading subs.
---
I'm guessing how you join players on console is completely different than how you join them on PC. We don't have this problem on PC because the only way we have to join players is through a menu that displays an icon next to survival players.
---
Lol yeah it took me a lot of tries too.
---
Legendary vendor? What's that?
---
I noticed that I couldn't place stored blueprints that have items I don't have the perks (or plans?) For. I assumed this was just for pvp servers to prevent exploits. 
---
Im in a world rn where all you see in the top left is this guy killing the same guy over and over and over
---
This deserved way more credit. Thank you OP üëç

---
Fair enough. I can‚Äôt be dealing with bloodied build I like nice fresh full health. Thanks for response.
---
Thanks for lettin me know I'll come and join the fireworks
---
Of course, I'm still running through the silo right now 
---
I actually really like It's a Trap, pretty quick and easy (since the Scorchbeast is grounded) to complete for a decent chunk of XP. 
---
Well then the problem aint the gear, because what ever you would do the gear- remove and make people earn them again, gear would still be cheated gear, if people are still duping.
---
Ahh I gotchya. I'm just trying to decide how I want to go about making a melee build. I like the idea of focusing on one aspect so probably going to end up just making a new character.
---
There's nothing meta about them. TS is obsolete. Explosive works only because you can increase the damage by fair amount with perks, and that it has separate resistances. Againts PvP players it's not good because it's so common most people have those separate resistances, but it's okayish.
---
B EE is probably generic meta and in PvP B vats should bypass it.
---
Any given day, any given situation, AA E is much better than TSE. TSE is relic that just get talked because it was so common.
---
I enjoy the challenge of higher tier food and alcohol. I know all the best places to go and harvest ingredients, and find it fun to go gathering for crafting sessions. I have also plopped my bar in a place that grants me access to some of the harder to collect bits.
---
Oh yeah sure. RGN has been huge part of loot system and now Bethesda has desided to throw it out the window.
---
I've gotten travel agent out of several perk packs, which means I've basically lost out on a perk card because it doesn't allow you to have multiples of the 1* only perk cards.
---
Right well thanks man
---
Hit me up when there‚Äôs an indiegogo for that candy throwing bouncing bunny game dawg, that sounds tight.
---
Oh oh thx
---
if I am still there and not done with it i will fight. but if im done with it, why shouldn't I be able to drop it so that someone else can claim it? Im not scared of pvp, as most of the pvp folks seem to assume. I have all of that gear too, Im just not interested in it. You don't have to be there. you can happily be doing something else and then bam. Also not the point. the point is why can't the player decide that they don't want the gd ws anymore without leaving the server? 
---
more then likely a dude boosting himself with his 2nd account
---
This is a prime example of why "everything is the same after level 50" is wrong. I‚Äôm level 150, and still finding ways to refine my build.
---
&lt;3
---
&gt; Every bit of criticism which was levied against 76 was well deserved.
---
Yeah, that trade stealing bug was brutal.  
---
/s
---
He‚Äôs legit he helped me out with some gear, thanks again.
---
Technically you just don't have to show up when someone else decides to claim it and it makes zero difference. 
---
Me and I buddy was grinding Watoga when we find a bag full of someone's loot. We're on different time zones so he had just logged on and I was just about to log off. The next morning I met up with him in Watoga again and the bag was still there, so we just went ahead and claimed it. 
---
Also easily countered with a perk and an armor mod.
---
You can setup your first spawn point in adventure mode before going to survival. 
---
Or just give us an option to trash cards we don't want.
---
I would love more events that affect the map or everyone on the server. I think things like Powering up the Power plants and how the Feed the People event used to give server-wide rewards are great ways to make the 're-building' aspect of the game feel more substantial. I also agree that cheaper fast travel and some kind of notification system would get more people involved in events. Rare, event-specific rewards aren't a bad idea either, and it could be seasonal to constantly roll in cool new stuff.
---
I love those things. I'm geared well enough to slice through anything. But those are sure fun to use. They really do some serious crowd dispersal. I literally use every last scrap of fiber optics and raw yellowcake flux I acquire to create them. I'll even drop those on turret bases behind the Whitespring Golf Club whenever I encounter those scourge of the earth. 
---
Thank you for enlighting a man.
---
ok. I didn't know that. thank you!
---
What point are you trying to make here?
---
Nice.

&gt;&gt;  No it's just that yer an idiot.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; an there we have it,the ad hominem
---
It's not an *ad hominem*, you *are* an idiot.
---
PVP should've never been a part of this game, just a jump on the bandwagon for Bethesda to make money, people should be helping each other instead of killing each other, and we call ourselves civilized, bitch please...
---
Could you mod mine for 500 caps? I‚Äôve scrapped so many and currently out of ultracite to make more. My psn: cattabliss, if caps are good add me and I‚Äôll look for you tomorrow? I should be on around 4 pm EST
---
Mind if i join?
---
Of course not, always looking for more
---
What is your psn?
---
Kill a deathclaw 
---
They are usually not that high level
---
G_O_B12345
---
Was it Cooking Stove or Kitchen Stove??
---
I got the gas sign from a toolbox at a red rocket :) so it can spawn in the world as well 
---
That's amazing.
---
&gt; and expecially still a necessity in PVE. 
---
Uh, no, no they're not.
---
Are you appearing offline?
---
Rewarding everyone totally fit the theme of the "feed the people" event. changing that was a mistake. it's not like it hurt anything to give a free can of dogfood to everyone on the server. 
---
Yep, totally forgot about that, it's fixed now, and I just started launch prep 
---
I get that but I still think if they were more realistic it would be a boon for us all in the end. 
---
You're not the only one and it was mentioned a few times already (at least I did). Stealth is broken since patch 5 or so. If I remember correctly there was something done regarding stealth in patch 6, but weapon change is still breaking stealth.
---
It's annoying af and I hope it will be fixed in one of the upcoming patches. 
---
Were do you get the raider armors as well as sturdy and heavy metal.
---
You claim "Every bit of criticism which was levied against 76 was well deserved".  During a long week the biggest criticism was the "trade stealing bug".
---
Which didn't even exist.
---
Whatever the game suggests I price it at, minus 5-10%
---
I want to be a better option then Vendor Bots, to ensure more customers. Hell, I won't price ANYTHING above a thousand caps. Not even that armor that tryhards pay 100k for.
---
Even if I sell everything for 100 caps, plan wise, I'm still gonna be swimming in caps, so why should I be greedy and take more than I need if I am already about to get more money than I would selling to vendorbots?
---
It will be an interesting take on the mode. Hoping to see unique rewards from this too.
---
Yeah... are you on console or PC?
---
His Mom locked him on the basement because of the smell and he‚Äôs doing this out of frustration of running out of soda and snacks.
---
I agree, maybe make raw food guaranteed to make you sick in return for a longer or nonexistent condition bar. That way you can collect to your heart's content, but still have to cook the food to get the proper use of it.
---
Dang, the social menu still syas you're offline ;-;
---
Bethesda did a good job with this one
---
I'm sick of the alcohol challenges but come on man. You knew this game has alcohol and drugs in it. The onus is on you to walk away if you can't handle it. Change yourself, don't expect others to change for you.
---
Hey, it's a feature not a bug 
---
True :/
---
I think it depends on what type if build you are going for. If your going to go with a metal building you'll need lots of steel if not then wood. I build with wood quite a bit, but I also use lots of copper for lighting, and some decorations. Ceramic and cloth I use alot for decor.
---
Not far from  vault 76 down one of the trials near it but cant remember which one. I saw it at level 5 and I'm now 87 lol
---
Better, but far from fixed. I still get disconnected at the most unfortunate times though, for example, seconds after starting a quest. ( Maybe it's the quest, not the server instability? Hmmm)  
---
Fast travel mat for the owner only would be great, but I have heard of mats being used at workshops, but other players spawn on them, not just the owner.
---
We don't know what the server side mechanics are for legendaries so can only go off what we percieve and anecdotal evidence on this sub.
---
 For me, West tec seems to have had its leg spawn dropped, used to be around 80%, now about 50%
---
 Whitesprings seems to be about the same as its ever been since Christmas, with a 100% chance of leg.
---
And while we're at it make the game offline only, because what you're suggesting would utterly obliterate servers.
---
Every asset in the game? Even just adding everything from Fallout 4 would destroy server stability.
---
FinalRender and that guy with the skyrim pfp are great at showing how well you can use the CAMP system if you're creative and think ahead (you don't have to like these guys (I'm not a huge fan) but you can't deny that their stuff looks good).
---
Fallout 4's settlement system was wonderful, and while I'd love more scrappy, wastelandy stuff, your suggestion is unrealistic.
---
And adding human NPCs undermines the game's plot and lore. It'd ruin the lonely vibe entirely. 1. If there were other people in Appalachia, why would they live in player settlements as opposed to the bigger towns? 2. If there are people alive, why do VAULT DWELLERS WITH NO EXPERIENCE have to do all the work? 3. If they're alive, then the Scorch Plague can't be that bad, right? 4. If these people move into Appalachia after the main questline, then we'd need to segregate players who have and haven't finished the game.
---
It's dumb, my dude. If the story was different, then I'd like settlers in my little slice of Appalachia, but with the current plot it doesn't make sense.
---
Eh to me it's just something to screw around with from time to time for fun or whatever. It's not my preferred play style.  And I'd never even think of trying to play the whole story through to completion on it in survival mode.   Would never launch a nuke in that mode.
---
Any that are posted here are likely to be camped shortly after.
---
I'm about to launch 
---
Raider PA is a random encounter. The first thing was most likely MODUS, an AI.
---
Honestly im fine with that
---
I completely agree, there is a total lack of assets and building capabilities when compared to fo4, there isnt even any faction related decorations, which is quite the pity
---
Sadly can't join, so i'll launch my own :3
---
I do yes, 3 pieces
---
I would love for bethesda ro respond to this... It hurts that my first character is a dedicated craftsman that can make all levels of non legendary armor and weapons but... He cant help my alt by giving them to him.. its just silly.. and yes i know you can transfer them through a friend but that is not the point. Some people dont have friends in game or they dont want to bother them every once in a while.. all and all, i think its a very much needed option .
---
Tip, most of my good stuff has come from events, 
---
 don't get to hung up on levels, a l35 instagating baseball for example hits like a ton of bricks in pve.
---
 With this in mind uranium fever is guaranteed 3 legs in 7 minutes,
---
 For top level, AWOL has a level 52 gutsy leg after a couple of minutes (depending on how fast you can clear mobs)
---
 Horde events have guaranteed leg at the end. If you are lucky the event fast travels you directly next to the legendary, and it takes seconds. (I believe but cannot confirm categorically that you only need to hunt for scorched, robo brains, and supermutants)
---
 Finally, the Queen, 30 minutes of pain and ammo for the same chance of drop as a 2 minute AWOL. 
---
So long as players and their dead bodies are marked on the map for all to see I won‚Äôt touch this mode
---
Exercise your self control.  It isn't their job to cater to those who can't regulate their vices.  
---
I noticed that if i just sit still, not moving at all, radscorpions will emerge in a few seconds. Then all it takes is one shot and they'll never burrow again. 
---
If i'm moving around or i'm above concrete/wood it may get buggy.
---
Death is always waiting for you, it's the only guaranteed outcome for our short-lived lives.  
---
"Buy shares in Vault-Tec, for when the real apocalypse happens, and get cryogenically frozen, and be revived soon after the world has gone to sh\*t!"
---
It actually is for Mr. Messenger
---
Is that not normal? I avoid Whitesprings because of all of the ghouls.
---
Dumb. 
---
I stopped playing the last few weeks because of all the alcohol challenges. I don't get much time to play as it so wasting my time finding and locating 10 - 50 different alcoholic drinks is something I'm not willing to spend my limited time in-game doing. I don't like missing out on Atoms but I also don't like dealing with the side effects of the alcohol or the addiction system. Waking up somewhere random was fun once but more than that is annoying.
---
WTF? What's it to you how others play the game? There's a leaderboard for time survived right?
---
Basically. I completed everything in less than 4 weeks. I wanted to know what‚Äôs new on there and if there‚Äôs a reason to come back. I loved the game but I had done everything possible. All armour. All missions. All side quests. All factions. I just wanted someone to be like ‚ÄúOMG yes! It‚Äôs got more missions, npcs, new power armour. There‚Äôs a reason to level up now....etc‚Äù
---
I dont think duping is still a thing. Its just that everyone managed to get their hands on one and bethesda only targeted mega hoarders. I think new weapons would help if duping is auctually fixed. 
---
Eye of the storm
---
I only see a floating owl head 
---
For me, only three star legendaries count.  None of the two or one star kills counted.. screw this one, I am done
---
Collecting another piece out in Apalachia started the mission, so I'm all good now
---
The accidental damage threshold being raised was great news. Definitely picked up a few ‚Äúwanted‚Äù status back in the day from really miniscule amounts of damage.
---
Buckkle Biters are bad boys.
---
DJ Preston Garvey! Another workshop needs your help
---
I've broken into quite a few of these bases to kill wanted people, you gotta look for a weak point. somewhere where they left something like a destructible wall or a big enough gap for you too squeeze through, and marsupial helps a lot too
---
You mean on the map you see before logging in to a new server? that map?
---
&gt;assassin's/-8% damage from players  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;sentinel's/-15% damage when standing still
---
Everyone talks about these armor sets as though anybody can get them.   
---
Bullshit. 
---
I know one guy with a full set, and it took him a month or more to put together  through trading and maybe even paying some real world money.
---
He did not have a single piece drop from a legendary enemy.   
---
Stop acting like a full set of Sentinel assassin armor is obtainable by anybody with enough grinding.   
---
It's not. 
---
So yeah, Sentinel assassin's is way more powerful than PA but who the hell has a full set?    Virtually no one.
---
I use power armor heavy weapons build with an anti- armor lite machine gun with prime receiver.    It shreds though every kind of armor that I have ever  encountered. 
---
I have reactive plates installed and all three levels of blocker.  Players with bloodied death claw builds hit me and they drop dead. 
---
I've won some fights, and I've lost some fights, but that's every type of build basically. 
---
Should they take the guns out of the game for all the people who have had family members who were shot?
---
I mean? I'm not trying to be an arsehole but they can't tailor things to please everyone in the world who have been affected by different things. 
---
Tip for all the innocent players looking to play survival mode, I will fuckin rob you. Like Bethesda I'm just warning you on what happens in Survival mode.
---
When I read this post I instantly heard my mum, its just something a mum would say but about drugs or beer... Tip for innocent kids thinking about taking drugs, don't. You hear it?
---
P. S I WASN'T JOKING, I will kill you, then rob you.. then imitate teabagging you.
---
Note: I don't camp but if I kill you in whitesprings golf club I will run back to the station to see if you were stupid enough to respawn there. 
---
Damn that sucks! I even got a 3* TS gun from a lvl 1 legendary chicken. The odds of getting a legendary enemy to spawn increases when there are more than 1 players in the area it also helps to having players over lvl 100 around. This is just based on my experience though. 
---
Indeed, screw it. I‚Äôm a working man, I‚Äôve a GF who doesn‚Äôt like me playing games so I‚Äôve got little time to play. Finding and killing 25 3-star legendaries just isn‚Äôt possible.  
---
You said that very well (also with the edits). Here, take my upvote!
---
Completely agree - it should be a fast travel point - best idea I've seen so far!
---
I‚Äôm having an issue where I‚Äôll fast travel to a horde event and it will just disappear when I arrive. I‚Äôve had this happen pretty often. 
---
It bugs out sometimes losing its radiation.  I know cause i drink this stuff like water.
---
Breach and clear is amazing, it‚Äôs a fantastic way of getting lead and aluminium, way way faster than workshops!
---
I... Don't know. I've only been there once for a mission. Too low level for that shit. I do wonder why there is level 60 assaultrons losing to ghouls. 
---
Assasin/Sentinel armor pieces + dmg reduction perks... try critical headshots they bypass the protection
---
After the last update they seem to force shut down servers, so you might have less time for your next attempts.   
---
I sometimes stay on a empty server to get led from workshops, but lately they have shut me down twice. This is how it looks like: [https://i.imgur.com/O1HqJz4.png](https://i.imgur.com/O1HqJz4.png), where the timer starts at 30min. Just a heads up, but you probably know this already. 
---
&gt;it‚Äôs because how easy it is to penetrate through power armor with a few perk cards like Tank Killer.
---
Tank killer  can do that to  virtually any armor though.      
---
Power armor isn't just about damage resistance.  With the right perks, it actually gives a damage boost to heavy weapons with the stabilized perk, which ignores 45 percent of the target's armor.    Combined with anti- armor legendary effects, you have a pretty deadly build. 
---
Is it invincible?  Of course not, nor should it be. 
---
Winning PVP  is not really even about armor, but who can inflict the most damage first and who can do it the fastest. 
---
Vendors, random weapon spawns, trading. As for getting one from a deathclaw, I‚Äôve never heard of that in all my 100 days in reddit 200+ hrs in the game 
---
The sign is literal. You only get half of the second one
---
Yeah I had gotten to a location with correctly levelled enemies, mostly cleared it out, then the event moved. Like what. 
---
I agree with this. Although player base building is a big part of the game I'm just not a fan at all, luckily my girlfriend is so she built me something and loves doing it. Some players would probably benefit from this greatly 
---
No one ? 
---
I can buy it for you for free 
---
It‚Äôs only 200 caps
---
If this gets added, imma want to be able to add mole rat teeth to my tattered mole rat mask until its a gaping maw of hell that will instil fear in anything and everything
---
My psn is Krisiboy21 add me
---
Wait how much does it cost
---
In total
---
So funny with git gud morons stating they are good running around with full OP armors and OP perk builds. Camping spawn points. Most people don't have the time or dedication to get a such items. Obviously the survival mode needs major changes. Or most people will just turn their back on this mode. And that's not in the best interest of the overall player base or Bethesda.
---
PS4
---
I only destroy turret camps at Whitesprings.
---
Explosive weapons are great for this, the Tesla Rifle is also pretty nice but i usually just throw grenades.
---
I'm at lewisburg station, game id is fatboyfresno161 
---
In the case of legendaries being hard to find that isnt really true. But good legendaries are very hard to come by.
---
Also let me just say that I'm sick of seeing bloodied explosive handmade and shotguns everywhere in survival
---
This is a awesome community 
---
Says 578 caps for me, I have 1 charisma and only the one perk equipped to lower costs and raise sales
---
Those hits were for head.
---
MIRV, or an auto grenade launcher if you're in a pinch :)
---
I can buy it for u add me now I‚Äôm on 
---
Same thing happened with me
---
Actually the problem is that this challenge was introduced for about a week n√≥w and (i didn‚Äôt do the math) I don‚Äôt really think anyone has 25 different recipe for alcohol beverages. Certainly didn‚Äôt have them instantly. I didn‚Äôt check th white print resort for the chef bot if he has.any of new Biv‚Äôs recipes.
---
This weeks challenges are still one of the worst though, without question.
---
The random spawn locations are classified into 4 subsets of which the lemonade stand and the vendor are part of the same one. Yes the lemonade stand can spawn anywhere the vendor bot can
---
I agree, I saw the gun, shit my pants, thought about leaving to make 200 bloody caps but didn't want to risk it.... but I do know how good reddit can be, glad I checked first!
---
And so it begins: First Fallout 76 Survival, then Fallout 76 Generic Shooter Game.
---
Fallout 76 Fortnite Battle Royale Soon?
---
Do u have mutations?? Can lower your ap count...???
---
Thank you man, I'm so stoked rn, been grinding to get a dragon rifle all day
---
Ur not on Br√∂ther 
---
What system are you on? I may have an extra. 
---
But not critical hits :)
---

Got armourer up to rank 3. Got an armourer in my next two packs. Pointless. Also have four of the charisma barter card (can‚Äôt remember its name).
---
Oh and 5 action girls. 
---
I'm at the vendor right now
---
Lore wise responders never used power armor. At least I haven't been able to find anything on it. Brotherhood was almost exclusively 51b. I'd love more PA paints though! 
---
K I‚Äôm joining 
---
Nah man. It was just a perfect box. No walls, doors, or cracks.
---
Ye I‚Äôm loading in 
---
Yeah, the burrowing to the top of a concrete / metal structure is a bit much. I‚Äôm fine with the general digging and reappearing behavior, usually can counter them with a well placed molotov or two. But let‚Äôs keep it to ground level or below, please...
---
Take your upvote and get out! xD
---
Or; like, with duplicates you can exchange them for a random other?
---
It sais ur in the main menu
---
Whitesprings is nothing but a farming zone for loot and xp nothing more
---
They literally give you a 20% exp bonus and expect people not to play on new characters? How does that make any sense at all? 
---
That player standing in the safe zone between nukes.
---
This was a bit of a brutal way of putting it but I was trying to find a way to say the same thing.
---
The alcohol challenges aren‚Äôt for me so I don‚Äôt do them. 
---
Same way as I‚Äôve never got the appeal of heavy weapons and whitespring farming. Sure I don‚Äôt level up as quick and I miss a few atoms but I‚Äôm having a hell of a time
---
The problem here is where to draw the line. Get rid of the things people may have moral issues with: the drugs, the cigarettes, the booze, the guns, the murdering?!? Not much of a game left.
---
I feel your pain and wish you the best but can‚Äôt agree with your point.
---
How about give players the ability to get a mutation that let's us burrow? Even the playing field I say! 
---
A TSQ Dragon would be AMAZING!!
---
VATS headshot.
---
I believe you just made up a weapon
---
I assure you it‚Äôs real 
---
So 160 x 2.5 ia not egouth to kill guy with less than 200hp? Or to do atleast some damage? Well good job bethesda.
---
Psa: pipe weapons can benefit from both pistol and rifle perks if you give them a stock that turns them into a rifle. 
---
Hang onto that bad boi.
---
Like being stranded on an island surrounded by sharks with lasers 
---
I'll maybe just the wording of the name there's no assassins
---
In this case the event is ON the horde boss
---
Sorry to hear it. I gave up trying to figure it out. I‚Äôll try again in the summer. Hopefully by then there‚Äôs unlimited stash too cuz that shit is annoying as well.
---
I'm certainly glad you got ass wipe for your ass and not for anywhere else.
---
Watch out for locked cargo crates... a few patches back, they quietly changed them from free for all to keyed to the player who used the holotape to request the drop. If you go after a locked crate, you could end up wanted status for it.
---
Oh, and Mama Dolces won‚Äôt eat your gear anymore during ‚Äúfeed the people‚Äù, so that‚Äôs nice.
---
Orbital strikes get the job done.
---
imagine if you went to a fallen plane site and drNk one and saw a ghost-radiation ring then a ghost plane come breaking apart as it crashes through you.  they do it all in that blue hue of the Nukashine.  It'd be pretty epic if only.  But I'm sure it will never happen.
---
Thanks for the downvote. I guess you don‚Äôt want your mind to change then
---
It‚Äôs called the ‚ÄúAssassins The Dragon‚Äù just gives that extra 10% damage to players 
---
See it depends on the definition of good legendaries. If it's used in the meta you bet your ass people will be duping and selling it. But if you want a legendary that would only really work with your build, it would normally be quite hard to find, but with duping, it floods the market, making it almost impossible to find what your looking for 
---
It's not a main stat though so that's not the name of the weapon
---
that should be changed
---
Are you going to want instigating anti-armor excetera excetera that'll determine the price much more
---
Dying from a ranged 1shot explosive weapon
---
That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called in my pip boy 
---
Why hasn‚Äôt this gotten more karma 
---
\+sneak damage bonus
---
\+high RoF
---
\+Blocker
---
I was just wondering it‚Äôs cap value mostly 
---
Technically, each region has unique cosmetics you can only get by doing events in that region. Mostly alternate colors on other gear, like a different colored firebreather's outfit. But they are 1) quite rare and 2) unadvertised/unknown, so nobody farms them.
---
ITS ALWAYS BEEN THE HUB IM EPIC LULLING THAT IT STILL CONFUSES PEOPLE JESUS FUCK
---
Giving you an upvote for the simple fact that you're the first person in a week I've seen refer to The Whitespring Resort by the correct name (instead of "whitesprings").  Thank you!! :)
---
There are empty counters all inside since launch day, stop being stupid.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_8BzXING-A
---
But whitesprings has already been the first Hub, people are just too brainless to stop posting about it.
---
It‚Äôs a build especially to counter big hits... use crits, fast fire rate + stragger skills or a a gamma gun...or plasma granates...or just hit him if he moves... 
---
It doesn't need to be easier, but:  
---
A) it should spoil slower and more importantly  
---
B) It should have vastly better effects.  
---
Like, it's one thing to munch on some mongrel bits or some cooked radroach, but the bigger stuff should be more impressive and the things that take, like, six different ingrediants should be \*way\* more impressive than "+15% food, +20 hp" or the like.  
---
Give us cooks some real MEAT out there!
---
? 
---
With no stretch of the imagination did the OP ask for them to "Get rid of the things people may have moral issues with: the drugs, the cigarettes, the booze, the guns, the murdering". He specifically said all of it is fine ...  just the constant weekly AND daily challenges to drink 25 alcohol, get drunk and do \_\_\_\_, etc.etc. is what he's referring to, and THAT I totally agree with. 
---
Sorry. Assumed it was you because it was very sudden. Someone else out there reall doesn‚Äôt like VATS.
---
Stealt boy and sneak attack
---
In your edit you nail it on the rl part
---
I do this post only for knowing what people think, i don t judge anyone
---
If you are at all paying attention to sounds it‚Äôs very easy to hear someone coming. Even if they are crouched. Unless they are pushing the thumbstick a little as you possibly can. 
---
Could you elaborate on how OP's history is similar to yours?
---

One a week? OK.  Several EVERY DAY?  Getting ridiculous.  There's way more to this game than getting plastered every day.

Berry Mentats: +5 Intelligence and **highlights living targets for 5 minutes**. Increases thirst.

Stealth boy nullified. 
---
The world doesnt revolve around you. Do you go to restaurants and tell people their drinks are offending you? This is nonsense
---
What this doesn‚Äôt tell you is that you need to keep your weapon holstered for the immunity. Although loading time can still screw you over 
---
I think if white springs becomes a player hub they need to make the bots immune to player damage. Tired of fighting something at the resort and then next thing I know I'm being hunted by bots because of a stray bullet or blast damage.
---
The lighthouse to summon Mothman? Took me a while, but IF you try it hope you get the rad-toads spawning because the fireflies alone are really tedious to do.
---
What language is that?
---
One spot I find them near the logging campsite to the northeast. South of the red rocket megastop. The logging site is really good for getting wood as its surrounding tents and in trucks. As for the DCG, Its in the back of a truck. It does not always spawn there.
---
A big issue is it seams like alot of events dont  trigger untill you arrive. Just looking at the map its hard to know whats off cool down. It feels like if there was a list of "ready" event locations, mire would get done.
---
The server hop idea sounds cheeky but might be a good idea.
---
Give me a use for those 9 pack in light cards.
---
They need something stupid like, "bring twenty traffic cones back to one of the frat houses".
---
hey i didn't see  these on your list 
---
1 north of new river gorge resort near  the (turkey?) icon on the map. there is a training course thing there that requires really good jumping or a jet back. at the end of it there is a cap stash near a skeleton and med boxes. 
---
1 at watoga high school   in the office on a shelf in his desk under the computer.  when first enter the school it would be the first office on the left.
---
1 at watoga emergency service go into and make your way to the top where the legendary usually spawns. there is a fridge near a water fountain. the stash spawns in there. 
---
thanks for this list I will let you know if I remember of anymore that are not on this list. 
---
I would love the .45 from good ol' Joshua 
---
True but it‚Äôs like a new toy. We were all
---
Hype for brewing to be in the game. In all honesty its seemed pretty boring to me and I hardly use it but still, new content. 
---
Wait until the legendary vendor or whatever the next patch throws up. Then that will be the new flavour.
---
I love this game and the community but the knee jerk, short termism is what drives me mad.
---
The beauty of fallout, especially 76, is that it has so much for so many different people. My point is simply...take what you want and leave the rest.
---
I thought survival was going to be a br. And its unfair to jump to conclusions so early.
---
Cool! See you then!
---
Thats just a % dmg mitigation build. If youre hitting for 160 (paper) that'd do a laughable 1.01 damage to me after % and armor. If you're actually dealing 400, you'd be hitting me for the still incredibly laughable 3.48 dmg.   
---
Looks like hes prob running sentinel. but you can get almost max % dmg resist without it. (5x assassins + lone wanderer + dodgy = 90% dmg reduction.) If that's their setup, you could expect to hit them for \~9-15 dmg. (depending on how much resist they have)
---
And the vendor is really bugged,  
---
If you "collide" with the brahmin it will become hostile  
---
And you can kill it, wish it would work like Ghram
---
know anywhere else?   every time i go there the ants are already dead.    not that the deathclaw salvage isnt worth it
---
I love this idea. Jot this down in your notes Bethesda devs
---
I've never seen more than two players there at a time, daddy-o.
---
I mean that if they implemented a helmet that has DR properties, everybody would be running in that because it has the best math.
---
Agreed
---
The same spots that are in adventure or good here. Whitespring is the most risky. It‚Äôs the same mode pretty much.
---
I literally had no idea about this! I don‚Äôt know how I missed it haha
---
Mirv fatman (if you don't die first).
---
I pretty much only use the missiles. Other than that they don't protect my camp from random monsters. None protect you from other players
---
I just bought a thousand yesterday. Their survival mode earned them my $. Have you used card or proxy system such as paypal? I used card.
---
I guess it could cause a bit of conflict for newer players in the nuke zone deciding to have a quick explore, you know since they‚Äôre there, and maybe not knowing the etiquette etc.
---
I'm in the same boat as you, but i would probably live in whitespring still, even if it was free. Just so i can get more customers. 
---
The traveling costs aint the problem. It so cheap to travel with teleport, that it costs should be much higher than the current is, so that player would travel more on foot and less teleporting around the map. Its so refreshing to play in Survival mode where you travel from point to point by foot and see things on the road. What the point of having a great world, if all you do is teleport around and don't see a sh#t. WoW removed flying in new zones exactly to for this, players didn't get to see the world because they were just flying from point a to point b.
---
I agree with you, they should relax on the daily challenges. 
---
However for the sake of your own mental health and sobriety I would suggest taking a break from the game for awhile. Obviously you know yourself best but it sounds like it's triggering for you and may not be the best thing for you to be playing at the moment. 
---
Yep...  except for that elusive helmet paint, tho, right?  ;)    
---
Definitely a bug. 
---
Someone did this just yesterday!! They set up a flea market, sold the spaces for 50 caps to each player and had little boxes built haha!
---
So yes there was a build that was PvP based and still viable. Nerdraging serendipitous bloodbuild with emergency protocols mod.
---
The problem is its not viable anymore as current meta shreds through them without any remorse. On the other hand current meta shreds through anything so I'm not sure thats indicative of anything. Before survival was released I've been saying I got my PA PvP build prepared yet after these changes I must admit it ceased working.
---
This, and some High tier food is underbalanced. I mean there is 2 ingredient food that gives you same buff as something with 3-5 ingredient.
---
Something like this is coming already next patch:  
---
* **New Features: C.A.M.P. Decorating, Player Vending, Functional Camera** ‚Äì Use items from your stash to decorate your C.A.M.P. Build vending machines and flag items for sale. Simply set your prices and walk away to continue your adventures in Appalachia, being sure to capture all your favorite memories using the new functional camera. The vending machines do all the work, you just need to count the caps.

---
I hope we get weapon stands, where I will put my fully upgraded alien blaster in. (Don't be copycats ;)
---
Best place to look for one is the top floor of Appalachian Antiques over by Watoga.  May take a few server changes if it has been looted already.  (There are also a few other weapons that can spawn instead also but mainly the gauntlets) Also while up there over by the bed there is sometimes a cap stash.
---
And they say there aren't any heroes left.
---
wow.
---
I put them up so that when I'm sitting there inventory managing or crafting I get an alert to the free resources that just strayed into range
---
Camp decorations is upcoming as per the road map.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
What system?
---
I'd love to be able to set my level 3 card to level 2 or 1 if my build changes or demands it. It'd be dead useful.
---
Duping has been shut down. That last patch to the vendors put a bullet into it. The first time you see a rare fastnatch mask for sale for caps you'll know it's back. Beth are probably minitoring it, an when theyre confident duping has been stamped out, they'll raise the weapon level cap and obsolete the dupes
---
In May according to the roadmap we will be getting a legendary vendor, we will be able to take legendary weapons there to scrap, customise and re-roll effects on them, handing them in will reward tokens that can then be used with the vendor according to Todd at the recent Bethesda Game day‚Äôs FO76 Panel 
---
No rare masks though. All that other shit existed before duping was patched.
---
My CAMP is in the Ash Heap too! I love the atmosphere there.
---
Rare masks like old man winter was only availablr in the dev room. Anyone with one i heard glitched into the room i heard
---
They are gonna add turret damage scaling next patch.
---
You are 100%.  
---
They are doing too many of these, not only it's like boring as hell, but also it's about promoting alcohol, wich is one of the worst addiction around.  
---
 this shit takes all your daily playtime and it's becoming promoting about alcohol at this point.   
---
Such as gambling , I don't think it's a good idea to promote this in video games, especially when you know kids are playing it.  
---
To be honest here, this whol 'make alcohol' dlc is very weird from my point of view.  
---
Like yeah, they're actively promoting drinking alcohol.
---
I have 4/5 sentinel armor and everyone kills me in 2-3shots. Thats not much logical when they use 70damage automatic weapons.
---
I just don't believe it is so overpowered when you have all of them with assasins too.
---
Three hundred and forty what?! This is why Bethesda jumped on the bandwagon...
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a raider lul‚Äù is just this game‚Äôs version of ‚ÄúThe game lets me do it, that‚Äôs all I need to justify being an asshole.‚Äù
---
Griefers don‚Äôt deserve a reasonable conversation. Apparently Bethesda agrees because they made slap damage zero and soon even CAMPS will be invulnerable.
---
They can go RP raiders badly in Survival, now.
---
Yes please! 
---
What system you on? If PS4, I've got a 1* Vampire's Deathclaw Gauntlet I can sell you pretty cheap. It gives you a little health with each whack. I think it's a level 50, but I'd have to check to be sure. Might even be able to throw on the extra claw for a little more if I've got the mod. 
---
??? Promoting drugs such as alcohol is not their job neither.
---
I hope there will remain servers, Like they are now. Even i don't really like the PvP in f76, i kinda like the thrill of fearing death behind each corner while leveling. And it forces u to plan ur trip better
---
This is dodging the OP issue, and is not at all on the point.
---
Where was this? I haven‚Äôt seen it since they were adjusted but I‚Äôve always wondered if the spamming was partially a bug. 
---
Nah maruspials fun
---
Hello,  
---
 Another dodge answer that don't actually anwser the point.
---
That's the point of getting dupe cards...
---
I'm getting really tired of seeing posts like these, followed by comments like yours and the parent comment.
---
That's the whole point of the cards. *You* choose when to upgrade them. *You* build your character depending on what levels you need your cards. That's the whole damn point of dupes.
---
And another dodge answer. You're not awnsering the OP's point.
---
Yeah. I came across this for the first time last week. A player had actually built a camp just full of turrets pointing at the side entrance bit where all the ghouls hang out. 
---
Still hoping to get spear mods to make them more viable.
---
And shields some day.
---
So i can be a spartan or roman soldier, fight the creatures of the wasteland and found a new Caesars Legion with actual ancient weapons !
---
Yes, this I agree with.
---
I know that it's the end of the world, but I wish you could ride trains around from place to place.
---
&gt; meta
---
&gt; TSE
---
Oh, you innocent child. Where have you been since January?
---
Nah
---
I think it is garbage. I get Rust does that, but Rust does also is better in every department compared to F76, when it comes to such game.
---
To me PVP with this is going to be dead. I am not interested in building new character every season (one of the reason I don't play Rust either), not that I don't have time, just it's against logic of MMO. Collecting gear is going to be pointless if I can't use it. Think ESO- "Ohh you want to PVP, here start every season new character and gear up again". This is also like their cheap way to make game longer- "Instead building new content, what if we just wipe their character every now and then and let them to play game again?"
---
Oh cool! Where is it? 
---
Most of my CAMPs have been in or around the Ash Heap - it‚Äôs awesome! 
---
You need cooking stove
---
At least yours fires green blobs, my Gatling Plasma has no projectile FX and the impact FX are red laser blasts, also seems to be unaffected by the High Volate Heffe drink, kinda annoying.
---
Both times has been at the whitespring bunker entrance.
---
PS4 :)
---
What are you on about? Assassins is a first tier legendary effect on weapons and armor. If he has a 1* The Dragon with the assassins effect, its an "Assassin's The Dragon". 
---
Like a special leather armor that grants good energy and rad resistance but still has low ballistic resistance. Could be nice, but depends on the look.
---
I just want a scorchbeast helmet, even if they give no armor in this game for some reason.
---
If it's max level it's worth about 1000-2000 I'd say.
---
Vats snipers own pvp. I'm a melee shotgun and unless im stealth boy'd the whole time, I'm getting 1 or 2 shot by dudes that can see me before i can see them (high P rifles builds) and they can vats my head before i know they're there
---
No, sorry. 
---
What grenades in particular 
---
MIRV?
---
üòÇthanks. Is eagle artillery any good as well
---
Dont listen to the guy until you tested a weapon in PvP, it aint super cool but it will do the trick and things that do the trick dont go lower than 5k
---
Thanks for the correction.  Not sure why I don't remember it being first-tier maybe cuz I'm working night shift my bad
---
tried both the transaction just doesnt stop loading for some reason
---
Built a tool for calculating damage, though we dont know exactly how PvP damage has been modified. My tools uses the damage equation from FO4, which as near as anyone seems to be able to tell, is identical to 76. (my testing found the numbers were pretty accurate. this was done before survival and PvP damage modifiers. Which seem to have changed)

---
I think it‚Äôs fair to say some players grinded for their weapons, but to assume all dupers followed that logic is simply false.  It‚Äôs a way to cheat or shortchange the process.  It‚Äôs anti-grinding for chrissake.  
---
You‚Äôre allowed to do it but trying to rationalize how it makes the game better is where the argument starts and stops.  
---
For those that worked hard or acquired their god weapons or armor that‚Äôs how the game should be as they are rewarded for their gameplaying efforts.  For dupers or those that participate in duping?  I have zero respect for you or your approach and I sure as hell won‚Äôt celebrate it. 
---
Should‚Äôve been better ngl
---
Someone‚Äôs still in the throws of puberty. 
---
I get that, but what really really annoys me is that I also get duplicates of 1 star cards. I dont really need 2 "good doggy" cards, but still i get duplicates of those as well.
---
Word of advice, if you don't get a base grab a new server
---
Same
---
Why not?!
---
Any grenades i have in my inventory. 
---
I never use them in combat and i keep looting them. Breaking whitespring turret platforms is the one time when i get to use grenades.
---
You can get TSE The Dragons for 2-3k, which are clearly better as the 2nd shot does more dmg than the 10% assassins effect. If it's max level and 3* with a solid third effect like faster reload, yeah maybe 5k to the right buyer but not for a 2* unless the buyer is unaware of the market.
---
The number of rats ive had "burrow" through 20 feet of dead air under my base... FRT my base is a single layer of floors 20 ft off the ground.  TF did they get up here?
---
It's just on the bank of the pond that's a little SE from Charleston FD. It's basically in the midpoint of the line connecting Charleston FD and Widow's Perch. If you look at that area on the map you'll see some mountains drawn there, I'm right to the north of those mountains.
---
Dammit I wanted to visit
---
I had one going at me pretty much nonstop up in the mountains at the NE rift earlier today. I was tucked in behind a screen of rock and trees and she didn't even lay down smoke, just flew around screaming about how I killed her babies. So I killed her with fire. Fuckin' scorched. You know, I only picked up this Perfect Storm because I ran out of 5.56 and EM, but I gotta say it produces a most satisfying result. Open wide, bitch.
---
The same perks that everyone with a bloodied build is gonna use: Nerd Rage, Serendipity, (sometimes dodgy if you don't use Spav) and Emergency Protocol when you are in PA...
---
But well, these perks proc when you are at low health, they can help you survive for a bit... But in that situation you won't become immortal...
---
This thing doesn't happen only in Survival (where you go down in a few hits) but also in adventure, where builds and gear are more relevant.
---
I have a shotgun build with a 3* AAE +15% Spav Combat Shotgun with Enforcer... These guys should go down when I hit them with 10 shots (the first a critical hit) at point blank (or when I change to a TSE Handmade)...
---
My base was just a lot further. Admittedly, i should have just went there.
---
I did It's a Trap yesterday, but the Scorchbeast aggroed onto a pack of Super Mutants instead of the even thing and it failed me.
---
Learnt this the hard way last night - after the event was over and I found five of them clustered down the cliff. Just...eurgh. xD
---
Maybe someone will come show you haha 
---
yeah ive been going from hidden to instant danger in my high stealth build a lot since last patch 
---
I joined a defend workshop event yesterday, owner was level 20 or so. A level 26 turns up and claims it so the owner starts shooting at me, level 157, explosive shotgun...
---
Luckily I was feeling quite chill and suppressed the urge to one shot him though I would have been fully justified in doing so. I just sat and watched as those two fought it out a few times, me recording like a wildlife documentary or something. All the time level 20 was still red. Must have been squeaky bum time for him.
---
Moral of the story? Be very careful who you're shooting at.
---
This is not meant to be rude but perhaps instead of sitting down for more Fallout 76 you sit down at a meeting.
---
It is a risk vs reward kinda thing, when you fast travel then you already lost resources, often times more than your going to gain. Keep fast travel as is, just ensure that if someone traveled from the other side of the map they are going to still be rewarded for there efforts. If the most you could pay in caps for Fast travel is 80 caps then the reward should feel like a reward worth more than 80 caps, not a refund, or less like it is now.
---
It might have been two, sometimes two will spawn at Whitesprings. 
---
You must be the exception to the rule.  You say it‚Äôs not (and it is possible) so I believe you. 
---
The same person in the video ran 3-4 other weapons with 1K damage so pretty sure they weren‚Äôt all built or acquired.   Dupe City.

Don‚Äôt care how ‚Äûreasonable‚Äú you try to make this request sound, I  think it is at all reasonable or wise to expect a company or artist to change the content of their art to not to trigger anyone.  
---
They should create the content they want and we decide wether or not to consume it. 
---
 Otherwise we are talking about a more ‚Äûdesign by committee‚Äú approach where have to make sure what the designers don‚Äôt generate content that might interfere with the recovery programs of groups of people... which believe it or not goes way beyond the concerns of alcoholics.

I've stopped contesting them, feels kind of scummy. But my mood may change.

Not certain of which AWS youll be playing on. From task manager (ctrl+shift+esc) performance &gt; network (ethernet or wifi) &gt; resource monitor (bottom of window) &gt; TCP connections.   
---
Find the fallout76.exe in the list and copy all the "Remote Address" IPs addresses. There will be about 10 or so, 21ish connections many will be the same IP, just different ports. You can Select all of them and hit Ctrl+C to copy, then dump them into a text file.

Server matching is automatic, Id assume its based on ping stats. EG: the server thats closest responds the fastest, so youll get dropped onto it. (this doesnt seem to be the case in survival. I get the same server repeatedly)
---
To get on an american server, just hop on with a freind thats on american servers. Dunno why you'd want to as you'll be instantly increasing your lag times by a sizable amount. 
---
Oh come on, so now I got it removed and then tried to make a fool of you really? If I got it removed I wouldn't of accused you of doing it.

Now sarcasm mode on /s
---
&gt;EDIT2: Serious question, how do people go through life so clueless?  ...........  How have you not figured out reddit mechanics? What else don't you know?  What other things are not immediately apparent? Do you ever wonder?  Ignorance is bliss.  Guess that's why I'm pissed all the time.  The only one paying attention. ........
---
...... Have fun never admitting you were wrong
---
Thats for info, didn't know crouching doesnt work.
---
I've gotten into the habit of building a small 2x2 defensive base almost for the sole purpose of being able to toss it down as a mobile spawn whilst I'm heading to quests/before I pick a fight
---
Agreed. I‚Äôm always in need of my stash box and hoping I run into someone‚Äôs camp. 
---
I would do that if building wasnt one of the things i spend a lot of time on. Im honestly only on survival to try to complete the challenge haha
---
&gt;Breach and Clear
---
yeah, I do this a lot with my  gun character (not much with the melee one)
---
Thanks for the pics, but how?
---
My thesis is that noone is aware of the market as for now, myself included, because it was changed waaaay to much and now uses different maths.
---
That's the Bethesda way! Why think when you can blanket nerf.
---
Yeah that's fair enough, coming from someone who spent 80% of their time building, tearing down and rebuilding on adventure it's definitely weird getting used to "efficiently mobile" style of building instead of "aesthetically glorious"
---
Nice well thanks man
---
I'm actually against the cheaper fast travel, as I think it would be even more immersion breaking but that's my weak imigination.
---
I would LOVE to see
---
- better alerts when they start ... maybe a radio you can tune to? .. or a misc quest event tracker?
---
- better rewards and not junk / scrap / chems ... plans and outfits and caps yes .. please dont auto dump on me stuff I'm not picking up ... or only give me things that junk for components I'm searching for
---
Haha oh god 
---
I‚Äôm going out for lunch when I get back we can do it I‚Äôve got alarmist 300 steel
---
With that ammount I'm sure it's just a heavy farmer that couldn't sell any more but needed to drop for inventory space.  Ask me how I know.
---
I like the beacon idea. Forcing players to reveal their CAMPs would be unfair.
---
Thank you sir, made my day.
---
Hey, I can supply the materials for a Marsupial serum if you're still OK with making me one. My IGN is TheElderRosen.
---
yep, the times I have run into someone's camp it was run and encouraged them to trade with me since a stash box was right there
---
I agree, but your junk, your teammates also having to server hop, your quest progress, etc. It‚Äôs the game mechanic that‚Äôs broken. Clearly Bethesda didn‚Äôt think it through, and the simple way to fix it to eliminate the exploit is to allow the player to abandon the workshop. 
---
Cool, I‚Äôll have to check the area out some time!
---
Maybe, I originally thought of a become that hide it from the map but it would probably be expensive and unfair in new players
---
I agree, but maybe just for the players shop's (coming feature) , and before that, make camp safest for pacifist in adventure ( I don't want to see my camp destroyed in adventure) . 
---
Definitely still OK. I didn't look at a serious build on my first character until she was 80 or 90.  Things Will be a bit harder for you to kill for a bit while you adjust your build because now they are going to start spawning at max level but get on a build planner, plan out what you want and start working in the damage perks first. Once you start doing decent damage the levels will flow.
---
Not necessarily. The ghouls, like almost all mobs, scale with the highest level present so you only need a level 60+ somewhere in the vicinity at that point, or slightly before, and there you go, instant level 60+ ghouls. 
---
Ahhh right I was wondering about that mechanic. Man they scared the shit out of me, even more than a scorch beast. 
---
No, thank you. I don't need every idiot to come and look my CAMP....No actually, let them come but make new rule that I may kill anyone who comes at my CAMP in Adventure Mode.
---
I personally would like it if they made all the vaults free fast travel sites, in addition to vault 76.
---
Ok by the becin idea means you choice to build a be in that letter plays know if they are near a camp and maps it on there map while they are near it
---
I think that advice is out out there more as a warning than an absolute. If you follow a build planner a level 65 will absolutely be as powerful as a level 365 from a stat / perk perspective. Gear might not be up to snuff, but you can probably have something that is "good enough".
---
Of love if the whole stacking cards wasn't a thing and I could just put 3 of the same card in to get the benifits.  Kind of like how the lock picking one works you can swap them in and out and you need
---
I put cycling lights in them, but it requires a tall space under the roof as the pole is very high. 
---
But it‚Äòs not round-based, so I would say more like DayZ 
---
the way I see it.
---
if your looking for a fallout game full of in your face lore go home
---
if you want a gun game to play with friends or alone with more subtle lore welcome
---
Interesting.  I have yet to see the lemonade stand generate near the ice cream shop.  Maybe they have a ‚Äúno competition‚Äù restraining order.  ;)
---
Love this shit.  Kudos!
---
Get help bud. This isn‚Äôt Bethesda‚Äôs problem.... it‚Äôs yours. 
---
Had the slow moving robot the other night that I joined only as I was already there. Got all the way to the end and disconnected from the server missing out on any rewards. Moral to the story: what‚Äôs the point, if servers still disconnect you mid event.
---
Similar to sbq, had her at last 5% and again disconnected.
---
Oh yea. Good luck setting foot out of the forest as a new player. By the time you get to the Mire by following the main quest you'll laugh at everything there. Felt that pain while levelling an alt a while ago. Especially in the Divide you'll find the enemies are always a higher level as it's one of the most frequently visited areas by high level players due to the Whitesprings and at least one nuke silo. 
---
They should make the whole game free
---
What platform?  What happens when you try to aim?
---
Agree, reload sp is also very nice.
---
pipe revolver suited me untill level 50
---
Aren‚Äôt card packs RNG?
---
Noice.
---
Tesla rifles are super rare and deconstructing to get plans, is also a pain in the bum, since you dont always get one ...
---
I noticed that, too. It was non-stop, earlier. It seems to do a LOT less damage (I was ten levels above it, but they used to be a decent challenge). It also fired screams backwards? I don't think that should be possible...
---
I too wish the same for spears.  I had been finding and scrapping them for a long time before I realized there were none  :(
---
Yeah you will find when you are keeping a lot and run weight perks that some things you keep on you, some in the stash.
---
I don't know, seems to me of companies had to cater to every one's PDST we'd have nothing to play.
---
If I had one, I would sell for 100-200 caps, like all such weapons I have so far. It has basically only 1 perk. Thats 20% damage boost over vanilla dragon. Not worth much and the thing is, you are going to need swap it out. 
---
The game is designed for 4 People only. It probably never was their intention that someone can solo some of the events or whole contents of the game. Execpt the SBQ where you need more players as the Event text states. 
---
The Events that will come this year like the Vaults or Underground Bases, could fix that, because they will focus more on Group Pve, and Raids etc.
---
 But nevertheless Either you do something alone in this game and get the most reward out of it(Server Hopping) or you risk someone stealing some mobs you dont ''Tag'' and as a result get no loot from it. Fasnacht as a clear example.
---
  in the End they are just repititive Events with always the same Spawn Points, and no surprises. Tedious and Boring Content. I hope the Underground/Vault Stuff is completely impossible todo alone so you need to find other players that do this with you or this places just end up as a Farm place exactly like Whitesprings Golfclub.
---
I guess I overlooked that part, although I wouldn‚Äôt know what to do at a player hub anyways. I meet other players from time to time and I find that is enough for me. That is, of course, just my experience however. 
---
So I've been considering taking on construction requests as a side business in FO76.  I do charge a cap fee, but it's not what I would consider exorbident. (Still working pricing out but aiming for 1-5k depending on budget / project complexity / who's providing mats)
---
100% disclaimer, while I will do all the building myself, I do take inspiration from other master builders in Appalachia.
---
I just want a scope for it.
---
Is this for sure that the sentinel effect doesn‚Äôt work while crouching?
---
I‚Äôll be on for a few hours this morning. Usually on most of the day on weekends and early evening m-f during the week. I‚Äôm in CST zone. 
---
First of all; I wish we could duel wield hammers and sickles.
---
Second of all; that would be amazing! I support this idea.
---
Thank you! That‚Äôs very nice of you to say. 
---
Can‚Äôt you just abandon after you get your mats?
---
It‚Äôs just the ingame notifications that you‚Äôre annoyed with, right? 
---
I‚Äôll be on for a few hours now. 
---
Hi stop on by. I‚Äôm signing on now. 
---
This..soo much. While the lore that is there is interesting. It loses A LOT of its momentum in the way you need to dig for info. 
---
I suppose I‚Äôm incredulous because you can spawn anywhere and unless you‚Äôre on a team it‚Äôs not like the other player can know where you‚Äôre choosing to go in enough time to beat you to the punch and one shot you before loading in. 
---
In the future, block the person before respawning and they won‚Äôt be able to see where you are on the map. 
---
yep.
---
What‚Äôs your general synopsis?
---
For VATS its QE Harpoon.
---
Its flechettes mode make it effectively a shotgun, a multi pellet weapon. Its still however a heavy gun hence its how its damage is calculated. The way they changed the one-shot stuff is that there is now a maximum damage limit per single tick of damage, but since its multi-pellet none of the individual pellets get close to that limit. Together, they take down assassin-sentinel build in one shot.
---
For killing VATSers its bloodied handmade.
---
The way they changed how weapons are deadly anything with big enough base damage and decent fire rate is now enough to make it through even through the thoughest of guys. When I fight against people, I am very often asked what the fuck is happening. I've been called a cheater multiple times. I've had people asking could we please stop shooting and could I please explain WTF. The ones that sport a sneaky handmade build don't ask me these questions because they eat me in a second.
---
I literally just barely got that weekly, running the quests with two characters a day. And I got lucky on low amount of repeats.
---
If you go to the substation make sure to use the perk butchers bounty so you can search the dead ants for more meat and that‚Äôs how I get mine. If I‚Äôm lucky the ants are still alive, I basically spawn there run straight at the shed, jump on the roof and unload my handmade with commando and tank killer perks on into that deathclaw before he kills the ants if possible, but if I arrive and everything‚Äôs already dead I can still come away with enough ant meat for 1 rad ant larger by using butchers bounty 3
---
Panda does too, it's hard to farm rare outfits when you have to check a list every time and then check the map. 
---
Hahaha while I did not see it...I felt it. New player exploring first overseer camp..nearly shit myself at the warning haha.
---
There's going to be one of each vendor type at the Whitesprings as of the next patch.

All hail Bolsey

I look on the map and if someone is in an unmarked location for a couple min I go I investigate. I dont like when people wreck my camp but if I put away my generator and decon shower I'll be a little at ease. 
---
I 've heard so but never seen yet
---
As in one from each faction? Well, that is certainly good news, but only a few sentences of my comment related to commerce. I mostly care about traversing Appalachia.
---
Idk why I never thought about it, makes me rethink my chameleon sentinel piece and if I should just go full Assasins sentinel instead. Appreciate you clarifying it for me!
---
How many of those robot models are there 
---
I have found so far mr handy and mr gutsy and robot parts models 
---
I know from previous games that protectrons and sentry also have models do u know if there are any other models and where u would get any I don‚Äôt have 
---
I know it is not supposed to be a realistic simulator, but not all plants grow everywhere, and not all plants can be cultivated. Corn and grain amd tatos are relatively easy, the grow almost everywhere, but cranberries grow in wetlands and swampy areas, for example.
---
Xbox but no problem helping. 
---
...does this mean it's fuckin teddy time?!
---
I think one work around should be that various containers should open directly to different tabs.  Ammo box should open directly to the ammo tab, trash cans can open to junk, desks open to notes, coolers open to food, etc etc. That way they don't have to rework the current system but it still feels like we're getting different stash boxes.
---
I use it in Hope's of spawning on the other side of the map. World 5/10 times. 
---
The bloodied handmade has been sold for 1100caps. Throw me a number for the vampire shotty and I'll probably accept. 
---
I have 1 of every teddy bear just waiting for the day they can get out of the stash box
---
Just found the imported panda &amp; only have polar bear left to go
---
This is the day we've been training for ladies and gentlemen
---
The spawn camping is dumb for sure, it also just seems so boring waiting there all day for the next unsuspecting victim. I think there needs to be a zone with high level rewards like double legendary drops so players are more inclined to congregate in other areas besides train stations. 
---
I never fast travel to train stations and usually pick a spawn close to one in adventure mode so once I join survival I can sneak behind the campers and camp them.
---
There's a polar bear at whitsprings I'm pretty sure. 
---
Always the 23rd of October for me. Annoying cos thats my exes birthday lol
---
this is the first Fallout, or even BGS game to have that, the flexibility was probably borne out of necessity, but hot swapping was a side effect, they never intended for us to hot swap hacker and lockpick, but we can so we will, but yeah, maybe make lockpick and hacking tied to intelligence level?  I also think heavy weapons should have a minimum strength to be able to use.
---
Please, do my a favor and get over yourself. The only one here who thinks they are superior is you. Otherwise, you wouldn‚Äôt have taken the time to dissect my comment and write a novel about it. But now I feel the need to defend myself. 
---
My mention of being the ‚Äú odd one out‚Äù was simply because it was contrary to the popular opinion. Why anyone would even think about their superiority to the player base is beyond me, but clearly that exists. 
---
The max caps I‚Äôve ever owned is less than 3000. I know that because I have saved up for the LMG plans and as soon as I was able to, I bought them. I am by no means obsessed with being at max cap limit. 
---
I enjoy having to pick out what type of junk I should scavenge to take to vendors and deciding whether or not it‚Äôs worth the caps to travel to certain ones. I almost always spend the extra caps anyways because that is part of the game. I need caps, I will sacrifice a few to get more out of it. That‚Äôs an investment. 
---
Just because you want fast travel to be basically free, doesn‚Äôt mean we all want that. Yes, it is convenient, but where‚Äôs the fun in that? Post-apocalyptic Appalachia isn‚Äôt very convenient either. 
---
Thanks for the reassurance!
---
Don't want to be the "must be fun at partys guy" but a scythe is actually quite useless as a weapon, in contrast to a sickle.
---
dark blue X-01 legs would be great, i'm currently using full tricentennial and those grey fronts grind my fashion gears
---
Great list, what‚Äôs your reasoning behind locking all your doors tho? That seems more like a personal choice and maybe OP would like to share their camp instead.
---
Its definitely nice having a room you can lock so you can drop items in peace but I hate when I really need to scrap items and stash and someone‚Äôs camp is locked and doesn‚Äôt allow me to do that.
---
Oh boy lol
---
Commendable enthusiasm from the mayor, however. 
---
I'm using both, but....
---
If you rely on VATS Gun-Fu is a game changer. Makes it so much easier to wipe out large group of mobs.
---
Adrenaline is great for pretty much all builds.
---
2 points in Adrenaline: Gain +7% (max 42%) damage for 30s per kill. Duration refreshes with kills.
---
2 points in Gun Fu: V.A.T.S. swaps targets on kill with +10% then +20% damage to your next 2 targets.
---
I guess  Adrenaline if all you care is maximizing your damage output. With 3 kills you get the same damage boost 2 points in gun-fu gives you. 6 kills gives you 42% more damage.
---
Gun Fu is you want to feel like John Wick.
---
And what exactly is the OPs point? That hes an addict and can't handle having a game he plays have quests that are alcohol related.
---
Simple then walk away if it is a big deal, Bethesda isn't going to change something for the sake of a minority.
---
Should drugs be taken away too because former addicts dont like it? Or maybe take away weapons because someone was affected by gun violence.
---
If a video game affects you on such a level that you feel yourself slipping back to your addiction, then it is his problem and he needs to walk away.
---
Sometimes the server lags and it won‚Äôt register me picking something up for over a minute but if I go back then the item is no longer there and in my inventory. I wouldn‚Äôt doubt if the bug you‚Äôre describing exists too tho, here‚Äôs to hoping patch 8 fixes the stability of these servers that patch 7 seemed to break. 
---
There's plenty of cans of paint lying about the place, let us paint our armour! 
---
What if it was also a gun?
---
No loot on ranged for 16/17 successful attempts, and I put in a lot of damage. You get to her body and either nothing or watch it disappear quickly. Disconnected approximately 5 attempts, 2 of which have been 5% or less hp remaining. 1 attempt she flew away. And numerous attempts with leachers hiding in the shed. 
---
See the nuke warning now and continue on business as usual
---
Gun fu is awesome.
---
Why they didn't headshot crit you? You don't even use a stealth boy.
---
I've been saying this for awhile.  It always seemed strange that they have this one and only instance of PvP where the aggressor gets to decide when SLAP damage is turned off.
---
Someone else here made a good point that could be expanded upon. I think it would be cool to have say 3 "build sheets" one would have your combat perks or ranged perks, one would have your melee build or pistol build or something and one would be just utility perks like lockpicking, hacking and camp perks. You'd just hotswap between the 3 and only be able to modify them in your camp. It would save time shuffling cards and mean that when you get a cool card you have to go back home, equip it and then head out again
---
Boosting how? All he's getting is his own caps and junk
---
I totally agree. 
---
I have 11 points in Agility.
---
3 Gun Fu
---
3 Action Boy
---
5 Adrenaline.
---
I do think they need more wall and stair options, the overall community would build more for sure, but I think I make interesting CAMPs, they may not be the style you‚Äôre looking for but building is the main thing that will keep me playing this game. Add me and come take a look :) videos don‚Äôt really do any of them justice 
---
"Not everyone wants everything handed to them on a plate" speaks volumes, buddy. Your choice of words is all antibody really needed to know how highly you think of yourself.
---
I was being hyperbolic on the "max caps" thing. It wasn't so much a statement about you, so much as a broad statement about your type. The people who think any form of convenience should be banished from existence, essentially.
---
"Basically free" is ridiculous. Explain how "you must spend currency to fast travel" is fun, if you would? With free fast travel to train stations, Vault 76 and your CAMP only, you incentivize travelling on foot, since you've saved caps already and spending them to fast travel a shorter distance would be a waste. The current system just makes people skip over the entire map for extra caps. I really am curious how paying to fast travel to train stations is fun. Seriously, do you go "aw golly, I love having to spend in game currency to move to this location that would take an unpleasantly long time to travel to on foot" and then chuckle to.yourself about what great fun you're having?
---
I mean, I was just answering your first question. Don't have to act like a dick about me not responding to everything you posted.
---
So the "fresh start in survival" has been handled super nicely IMO. It'd be a shitty thing to do to force all those PvPers to have their builds unverified in real combat, they worked months for this, they are armed to teeth and they want to find out who's the greatest badass. You don't have to be a duper to be on this level, you just have to research the game.
---
But then there is a clean fresh of the vault experience, and I fully agree that it would be great and people should have right to play the game in which everybody leaves the vault around the same time. Us beta players had it.
---
So they said they'll be having it a seasonal thing. You'll create a seasonal character like in diablo3, where when the season ends you keep some rewards, but generally everybody who joins on day1 will be made equal for a minute, and people who couldn't - still have means to work to git their toons gud.
---
I just hope we'll also have servers with open PvP but old characters, so that casual PvErs can enjoy adventure, gangs can enjoy survival, and solo PvPers can enjoy fresh out the vault.
---
As a member of the gang, I'm mostly interested in fighting the deadliest of deadly enemies this game could provide - perfectly geared out characters with brilliant builds and great map control skills. 
---
I had my fresh out the vault experience and it was a blast. I support the voice of all the people who say they wish to participate in that too. But I also think there is a great value for faction-PvP in how the relationship between survival and adventure servers work - so you can train your friends on Adventure in how to fight Fallout, and when they know Fallout you train them how to fight people on Survival.
---
If they will make survival seasonal only, I'll play it, but it will be a heavy grindfest for my gang and we'll be forced to use all the aces we have on our hands. Powerleveling and powerfarming in groups, loot sharing so that its known who gets what if that is dropped etc. If they allow me to continue growing my gang and my network of opponent gangs, I'll be having that on persistent survival mode, and on seasonal survival I'll be having my fun as mysterious stranger.
---
I don't know. He might have been. I had 400~ max health and dodgy active most of the fight. It's hard to tell.
---
Yeah I am on console too (xbox)
---
If you are content with your build, I see no problem. as for me, I'm ditching my PA
---
I‚Äôm a seller myself and this was my thought when they first released survival. 
---
Just ask the buyers to join your server, legit players never have an issue with this and at least your then comfortable in the setting of your choice.
---
Danks for the numbers, I'll stick to 2* Adrenaline then
---
Never lose gope.
---
Someone gets it!  The message that pops up warns you other players could take it at anytime and you'll need to PvP them to keep it.  That's it.  
---
How was I acting like a dick? The way you wrote it implied that you thought what you said would effectively relate to the entire comment. This is on you, pal.
---
Server hop.  Sometimes the door doesn‚Äôt load properly on log in or fast travel.  If it‚Äôs supposed to be there ( you are on the quest ) it will eventually load.  Sometimes takes a minute or two.  
---
Like, like like uhmm like.
---
I think you were in a better position to dictate how the fight went, so there's a lack of retaliation. 
---
Hmm i played survival a lot almost 100k caps earned so far and didn't encounter anyone who will survival head shot burst from my bloodied+fire rate handmade with holding a space bar for crits. I can test it on you if you want :) (in adventure and i will give you caps back)
---
Theres also the fact that fast traveling should be free to events 
---
Not to mention that some just are unable to be completed 90% of the time
---
I think my comment came across as a bit arsey and unsympathetic, I've had issue with addiction (drugs not alcohol) so don't really want to be a dick towards someone I empathise with. 
---
A response and an appeal aren‚Äôt the same thing. An appeal would be ‚Äòwe‚Äôve reviewed your circumstances but you still fucked up the game for all the other players so gtfo and stay there‚Äô.   A responses is ‚Äò we aren‚Äôt going to review your circumstances because you fucked up the game for everyone else. Gtfo and have a nice say‚Äô
---
That's what the giant bounty is for, it forces others to come to me. I was camping that spot for a little bit. I had the elevator mined up. But the opponent came in with a stealth boy. Was clever by both of us. Next time I'm using plasma mines.
---
You guys just coming out of the vault have no idea what it was like for the first of us that emerged from 76. I lost everyone I knew within just a couple of months. I can't even begin to describe the horrors of what we encountered. 
---
Shit was crazy in those days, like reality itself was still trying to figure out what it was in this new post-apocalyptic universe. 
---
It was by sheer will alone that myself and others like me survived. 
---
Now things are a 1000X better. 
---
Never forget the determination and sacrifice the 1st 76'ers who paved the way and helped make this world what it is today.  
---
I do the same.  Found some super cool locations that way.
---
They could always make it un-nukable
---
Depends on what weapon you are using too. If you are one shotting mobs, then gun fu 1 is probably sufficient for the auto targeting. 
---
Yeah but they responded to some and not to others 
---
while I'm standing still and have AP i'm basically immortal is what I've found. I've only died twice for roughly 10k caps and both times i got caught walking.
---
&gt; but only a few sentences of my comment related to commerce.
---
I answer your question and you respond with that. Seems a bit dickish to me.
---
Also good for if your making a set of excavator
---
Well yes, after level 50 each level-up will give you the choice of switching one point in your specials, doing so will prevent you from taking a perk card that level, so yes it completely possible, gotta level up just to switch the points, after you are done you can resume to pick new perk cards :) 
---
What?
---
Don't you know you can move points once you go beyond level 50 each time you level up, at the cost of not taking a new perk?
---
You‚Äôre only proving my point by attempting to put me down for playing the game the way it is currently set up to be played. If you want free fast travel, play survival mode. 
---
This is complete speculation, but I would think you‚Äôve already tried that. And failed miserably. So now you want that same implementation in adventure mode. 
---
Regardless if that‚Äôs the case or not, play the game the way it is or don‚Äôt. I will continue to do so. Thank you for your almighty insight, it‚Äôs been a pleasure. 
---
Sentinel doesn't work vs vats
---
I think many of the items might not return. There was a lot of criticism that the early items were not "Wasteland" themed enough, so they might keep them away to avoid further criticism. The newer items seem more prepper and survival themed. But who knows...
---
Yeah hence the lack of a "good fight" you were hoping for as you have the higher ground.
---
Maybe try cryo as well. Nuka is still good against bloody sentinel though. 
---
With the coming vendor update dataminers have found hints that people will be able to set their camp as a visible fast travel point for other players. 
---
Definitely save up some ceramic and copper for building lights. I‚Äôd recommend buying the Brick wall set as I believe it looks the best
---
Seems a bit oversensitive to me. 
---
This is on you. I explained how. Your comment read in a way that made it seem as though you were trying to cover my entire comment with a single statement.
---
With a few more words, a sentence, tops, the misunderstanding coulda been avoided.
---
Like "idk about the rest, but to answer your question" or "well, for the question".
---
See?
---
Scorched, ghouls, super mutants, mole miners all used to be humans.  Kill them on sight. 
---
Other survivors of a nuclear holocaust - kill the for fun and profit. 
---
Artificial intelligence tells you to drop even more nuclear bombs - no problem 
---
Drink alcohol - NO, TOO RELATABLE. 
---
Especially if people continue to nuke it. Must suck for lower level players when they can‚Äôt get in because of it.
---
And this is the manager right here folks.
---
True, but the goal is if they want my 1400 cap bounty they have to at least work for it. I was surprised the nuke mines didn't touch him, loading invulnerability in the elevator maybe?
---
I'm gonna be carrying plasma grenades around a ton now. Only use Nuka Grenades for bloodied enemies for the rads. The good players know how to mitigate explosive damage, but plasma grenades don't seem to care about fireproof/dense.
---
You asked a question, I answered it, then you became hostile towards me because I didn't respond to the rest of your post too? Just wow. You're pathetic.
---
I'd help you out. Building is a lot of fun in this game.  Not sure of my wood and concrete supply but if you have some then we can start anytime. Can show you a couple of my characters places and see what you like about them. Then figure out a good spot and we can start building. 
---
Wait untill your level 80. Don't use any points until then. You should have enough to move SPECIAL points around and still get new perk cards 
---
I hope so! I love found two guitar while exploring that is like to display one day 
---
Oh, and I forgot to mention that the whole "get it before it's gone!" tactic is also designed so that players who haven't saved up atoms via gameplay will be forced to purchase them with money, but... atoms are in limited availability the further into endgame one goes, and the further one goes, the more invested in the game a player may be. 
---
This investment can lead to a willingness to engage with cosmetic microtransactions, for a variety of reasons that I'm sure you can all figure out without me explaining at length. There *is* a criticism to be made about the tactics involved in gradually limiting atom availability as player investment increases, but I'm sure you can also fill in the blanks there. I also doubt that this will be an aspect of the system that will ever change.
---
Basically, some players will never engage with microtransactions, and that's okay. Some players are perfectly happy to. Others will only entertain the idea after they've sufficiently ensured investment in the game, and so on and so forth. I think that making the system friendlier towards the players who are willing to buy (i.e. by not limiting items so harshly) would be a good move to make.
---
(Of course, I'm no expert in any of this. I'm sure they have far smarter people than me working out all the nuances of how best to get money out of people. I just want my cute dresses, dammit!)
---
Takes a long time if you are moving to an entirely different build. If you have most of your points in strength you can switch between melee and heavy pretty easily. Perception you can switch from shotgun to rifle easy. But if you were to move from melee to rifle you‚Äôd have to move most your strength to perception.. 
---
I mean we do still nuke them, but it's still only realistically possible thanks to TSE/AAE/BE Heavy weapons with bloodied builds. 
---
I have both, you have any really low lvl weapons or armor/gear? 
---
How was I hostile? Can you provide an example or are you going to continue throwing a tantrum because I simply pointed out that the question was not as pertinent as the rest of my thingy?
---
If you saw that as hostile, you might want some bubble wrap, bubba.
---
Platform? 
---
Besides getting back to the area, is there any benefit to free Vault travel in Adventure Mode?
---
As someone that got fucked in the ass by duping without actually doing any myself, I hope they delete all gear.
---
Or double the enemies level and level of gear. Make all the level 50 gear irrelevant if there is level 100 versions instead.
---
It'd be a shame if that was the case. I know some people prefer the raggedy looks, and that's okay. I'm a fan of those too... but Fallout attracts players from all sorts of demographics, with all sorts of stylistic taste! I'm a fan of the shiny, retro items, but I completely understand how that might be frustrating for people to see when they're much more invested in the gritty, post-apocalyptic vibe of the game.
---
The only thing that gives me hope that they might continue to offer things on both "sides," so to speak, is their recent releases of a bunch of clean CAMP items, like the water purifiers and the stove. But yes, who knows! I remain hopeful for the return of some of my favourite, long-gone items...
---
Bullshit on Crits and Dodgy

This isn‚Äôt the first post about the daily challenges. If you want to do them, then don‚Äôt do them. They‚Äôre not required. I don‚Äôt do them much, myself. Mostly because I‚Äôm too busy doing other things. I usually complete them by accident, and it‚Äôs like a pleasant surprise when the alert pops up.
---
You can also place a floating one  of the small metal power conduits in the top bar of the light that goes across (kinda a pain to line up tho) and hang a light off of it
---
I can see your point and I appreciate it's relative to your build.
---
That's what I keep hearing. But surely another player that's using stealth boys and spamming healing items also knows how to vats crit someone not in stealth?
---
This same guy had like a dozen + kills on that life.
---
I've killed over 100 of the things and it has dropped nana
---
If it dies, it will not be for the reason you believe.  Duping is not ruining the game.   The Bethesda team responsible for this, is with their balancing methods (1 way methods) and their lack of experience in this area.  I can only speak for my experience on xbox 1, but since they nerfed TSE and made it so armor broke at a much fast rate (White knight nerf), the activity level on xbox 1 is like 1/10 what is was.   They also nerfed a bunch of other mechanics that were tied to XP.  The total impact was that it takes longer to level up, your armor deteriorates quicker, so you spend more time farming and repairing, and creatures take allot longer to kill and become bullet sponges which then require you to farm/make more ammo.  After this, people launching nukes went to a trickle on Xbox 1.  Before this a nuke was getting launched pretty much non-stop,  I was on servers where a zone would get double nuked (not sure why haha) and I think even triple nuked I think I recall.  I have NEVER seen this again or any of my friends that still play since the nerfs.  
---
The only reason is so you have to out and farm it. 
---
The 12 step program was made for us to accommodate to society... don't know where people got the idea that it's the other way around. Guess I'll send a heated letter to the director behind Requiem for a Dream.
---
The door IS there, it just wont let me open it. It says that the door itself is inaccessible

Oh I did not know that about plasma. Good info, thanks!

wich platform are you? what is the 3rd effect?

Hey man, I‚Äôve got faith, that you can fully beat alcohol. I‚Äôm a fairly religious man, but believe it or not I‚Äôm also a scientist, a marine biologist to be exact. So your wife and friends can throw science around, that‚Äôs fine, I too appreciate the legitimacy of a scientific journal. But! You can still have faith, to have faith without really needing the evidence to prove it‚Äôs real is a sign of dedication. And there will always be challenges to sow the seeds of doubt in that faith, it‚Äôs up to you whether those seeds grow, or wither and die. Anyways sorry for going off on ya like that, I generally don‚Äôt get involved in things like this but I felt a tug to just say something, anything. Either way I‚Äôm hoping that you can overcome the challenges before you my friend, good luck out in the real world, and the cybernetic wasteland. 
---
Yes, but you don't need them to complete your build, they are just extras. You get 1 card choice per level.
---
But would it really be so bad to stop with the alcoholic dailies? 
---
I honestly dont know what to say mate only things I can think that buff us pa users is fireproof/scaly skins/retractor(?) And that's about it. I know from pvp experience we PA are quite squishy to kill unless , you're a low level, but I dont know any other reason why a dude not wearing PA isnt able to kill us efficiently. All I can say is lag a bug or that we PA are slowly making a rise against you god tier non PA users.
---
Not everyone is like you 
---
Whenever private servers come out I hope you can store items like in Fallout 4. I also have OCD and am a Fallout hoarder who wants to collect 1 of everything. I also hope you can host your own private server for free or pay for a private server that‚Äôs 24/7
---
I consider myself able to understand spoken english, but i couldn't tell what the hell were you talking about the whole video. Like when you read a page of a book and then realize you don't remember anything you just read.
---
Interesting, thanks for sharing!
---
Basicaly rust but with rpg elements. I was more hoping for old world of warcraft likehood.
---
Currently all i want is cap on bottlecaps lost at lvl50. And some balance adjustment because even over 50% damage reduction gear is super imbalanced.
---
In survival i kill everyone on sight, even lowbies, cause one level 19 killed me from behind with few rounds from handmade, and he got my 400caps. I am not sure if i want to kill everyone i was in vault with, but it is tooo dangerous, to belive stranger.
---
If they introduce seasons, everyone will be playing them, because there is no meaning to play mod, where you don't get reward. Diablo 3 was boring very soon.

That actually sounds fun.  Hire this guy

Watoga could be one once you complete the Mayor quest.

Since Todd said that the wastelanders update will "significantly  change the game", I wouldn't be surprised if they increase the server sizes. There have been a ton of stability fixes, so it might be possible.
---
I mean what are we going to do next, ban Fear and Loathing because it has too many drugs? Every recovering addict has their own struggles but going on and about to society is ridiculous when the program itself tells that you're the one that needs to accommodate. 
---
I wish there was a stabbing animation.

Go back to the Enclave vault and ‚Äúinteract‚Äù with Modus.  Had this happen to me and doing this seemed to kick the promotion to General

With only 24 players per server, I don‚Äôt think it makes sense to split them among multiple hubs.

From my experience with first survival weekly challgende i would add 3star legendary enemy on end of every event. 
---
So same thought  should be applied to ammo? Make it weigh realistically? It's fine where its at.
---
Im from Oregon (pst) and I'm 16 as well. My IGN is chweneboygaming.

The catch there is higher level people might use it just as a cheap way to travel while suddenly boosting the level of the enemies for those actually competing in the events.

Hey sorry I wasn‚Äôt able to grab it yesterday, I‚Äôll be on later today tho if that works?
---
My GT ATXlien I‚Äôll message you on there too
---
Feed the people should grant a proportionate boost to either the condition of food items players are carrying or grant a bonus to hunger/thirst timers. 
---
I'm generally against this kind of thing however I'm all for anything that works towards a working player hub at the whitesprings. 
---
I say make the train station the travel point.
---
Not true. Hunter/hunted gives you notification and i am mostly alone or one guy joins que.
---
I wonder what are people doin
---
Rad Any Lager, rad meat can be found at Appalachian Antiques just east of Fort Defiance. There seems to be a rotation of scorched, ghouls and RAD ANTS. There can also be some dead ants at Thunder Mountain Substation TM-02.
---
Orbital strike nades.  They are also so fun in survival with the last laugh perk. People go to loot your bag,boom an orbital on their head and you get the caps of the kill lol. 
---
Maybe next year they will release a content update where they unhook you from the simulation because it's actually time to leave the vault. And it's a pure hellscape, nothing like the simulations :)
---
I agree with you in that aspect. This idea I don‚Äôt like but I agree that it needs balancing. The fact that people have to use Stealth boys so they don‚Äôt get a VATS critical to the head and die in one shot no matter what armor or vice versa where you have to use a VATS critical just to do some true damage isn‚Äôt very good. Having to always pop stealth boys to go into battle I hate but there‚Äôs no other way to stay alive with all the Rifle builds using the VATS system. Definitely needs work I agree 
---
I'm sympathetic to your situation, but taking the drinking minigame out of the game because it negatively affects you based on your own personal history isn't how the world works, nor should it. Maybe this just isn't the game for you to be playing which might suck, but it's not on the responsibility of bethesda to remove things from the game based on someone's past. We wouldn't have very many games if companies did that.
---
That seems pretty accurate from what ive seen so far, there is a good bit of lore in here though for the die hards that actually read terminal entries
---
While a full recovery can never be achieved, it is possible with enough help and willpower you can reach a point close to a full recovery. But absenteeism is no cure, it‚Äôs simply trying to avoid the problem without searching for the root cause. 
---
At high levels, that cap price isn‚Äôt significant in any way, but it does add a bit of friction. For a player hub to be successful, it needs to be as frictionless as possible. For example, the cap price could be the difference between a player heading there if they only see four or five people, or waiting for it to get a bit fuller, hence compounding the issue. 
---
Stay strong Shankwelle.  If you need to step away from this game for a couple days, do it without another thought.  You've changed your mindset and behavior to leave alcohol behind you; you can stop launching Fallout 76 until Bethesda moves on to something less agitating.  You could never justify a couple of atoms, and you know it.
---
Don't bend, don't break.  We'll see you out there when you're ready friend!
---
Mountain Honey Moonshine, honey (x4) can be found in Helvetia inside the Honey House. More honey can be harvested for honey beasts that randomly spawn at Middle Mountain Cabins.
---
A paint job for it is going to be in the atom store so I'm guessing the base armour will be added to the game in an update and then you can buy the paint for the outfit 
---
Take a look at what? Are you on pc?
---
Razor grain and corn can be found in abundance at Silva Homestead and Billings Homestead, can't remember the exact amount but there's A LOT.
---
So then try server hopping and see if that fixes it.
---
You want the same form letter sent to every person that got banned?
---
..it is :) ..been sitting in the stash for quite some time, but I decided to give the stealth mode a try for a few levels. it's a nice change of pace.
---
This sounds plausible
---
I think I can make them. Then you can scrap for plans. It might work, not sure.
---
I undeestood that reference.
---
The sale is only on the slim cut suits on the display right behind the sign.  I asked.
---
They are nice suits though.
---
Tick blood Tequila, tick blood can found south of Vault 76 in the Moonshiners Shack and then south again at Gilman Lumber Yard. 6 more can be found in the Mire. Just above Camp Venture you find Treetops, if you directly West you will see train tracks, if you follow those train tracks you will see a small fenced in building just to the north, there is where you find the ticks.
---
I'm already looming forward to Halloween. I'm sure they will have some great events planned.
---
Yeah I saw that post he said he wanted to make some big long term decisions that would help make the game last so let‚Äôs see hopefully he will at least consider it
---
Id be curious to see if you can survive my build, i have all rifle perks, adrenal reaction and all crit damage and sneak damage perks, and a bloodied crit damage dragon. I sit in trees and 1 shot people
---
The drill.
---
will hold for about 10 min
---
Put all your caps and aid away, then you have nothing to lose.

I greatly appreciate your offer, but from what I've heard deconstructing them doesn't get you the plan. If that's how you got it though, I'd happily buy some off of you
---
You're actually making his point :P
---
I know. That‚Äôs why I included them. 
---
It‚Äôs good. 
---
I can‚Äôt jump on right now but I‚Äôll be interested in this another time. Where about is it on the map for future reference? 
---
You can. On top of fire pits
---
This is like saying daily kill quests make people want to murder in real life. If you can't differentiate reality from fantasy then you have bigger issues. 
---
Either wake up to the hellscape or wake up in the back of a wagon being driven by Todd Howard.
---
Death is a preferable alternative to communism! 
---
I get what OP is saying. I have quit doing daily challenges as well. Now I can't get that item I want from the atom shop. I don't always have extra cash to throw on atoms (especially when there are 4 of us in the house that play) so doing the challenges is how I get them. I am not triggered by the challenges, thankfully. I just got tired of the same thing day in and day out. Always a huge drinking thing. As a mom of 2, that life is behind me. Once in awhile when the kids are elsewhere, sure I might have me some Jamesons's so it's not that it bothers me. I just miss the other fun challenges. It seems to me that when Bethesda opens a big questline like the Nuka shine stuff in, they could add a challenge section in. Still a daily run through of course or a weekly, but make it it's own "daily challenge" section. Say, "Nukashine Daily" etc. This way, those of us that don't want to get plastered and take a nude pic (did do this challenge LOL) can avoid the drinking ones altogether. Each time they roll out a new patch with big content like that, the section would change. Like, from Nukashine to Vendor's Woes or something. Just a thought. Thanks OP for posting when others felt the same but didn't want to be seen as the stiffs. 
---
Pro- would probably add more variety Con- I wouldn't play it anymore as that's how I built my character from the beginning.
---
Yeah, I was at the Army base (Mcclintock) in the watch tower when I saw a mole rat down below, about 50 feet away. I was thinking, "I'll just VATS it from up here." Then, within a second, it was bursting out from the SEE-THROUGH METAL GRATES around the top. Really?!
---
Now I have to go play in that world again. I find myself missing it. Love that game!
---
Then you shall die to the mighty hammer and sickle, amurikan
---
Hip hip hurrah for the U.S.S.R.!
---
Personally I feel that removing a unique franchise mechanic from part of the game is not the good answer. I don't like V.A.T.S. at all, never have, but it is a Fallout mechanic that a lot of viable builds rely on.
---
https://youtu.be/u4RcHQJBzr4
---
Yeah, there are unkillable people. This one on video didn't kill me. But later another one did. So i leaved server joined another and guess what, it respawned me next to this guy. Rip mine 800 caps i killed so much people for (i have 20k on mule, so no worries, i am just frustrated how unfair this game is)
---
really no one wants this thing ok about to leave it i guess
---
I could bearly get close to it especially since i was realy low on caps
---
Re-run the ‚Äútranslator‚Äù program to rebuild the strings files
---
¬´Bethany‚Äôs freshly baked biscuits¬ª
---
Yes, that‚Äôs a good start. Then they should remove mutations and legendary effects. After that they should remove melee weapons followed by ranged weapons. They should also remove power armor mods and armor. After that they should get rid of power armor entirely-of course followed by clothes and costumes. After all of that the wasteland should be safe. 
---
I hear u and I know the major con would be people have to respec their character. I‚Äôm not saying remove Vats, just the critical aspect of it on PVP. I‚Äôve been playing for a bit now and it seems everyone is invisible lol 
---
If you want the plans, I found them at Watoga Station. It seems to have Sturdy/Heavy combat plans one at a time and semi randomly. Now that I have all of the Heavy plans it only seems to spawn the sturdy
---
I didn't say he shouldn't do it, I said it was lame.
---
Dude, it's only been eight minutes, very early on a Sunday morning. Chill
---
Sorry, I‚Äôm trying to learn here, so what do you mean when you keep saying ‚Äúdodgy‚Äù?
---
Two Shot and Explosive can no longer coexist, apparently. 
---
They're around I'm game, used as decoration on the sides of barns. Definitely possible 
---
They‚Äôre just wearing camo paint 
---
Why isn‚Äôt there a fire breathers flair for this subreddit?
---
There is a Prime reciever for the crossbow in case you haven't found that
---
Just going to leave [this](https://i.imgur.com/uGm6r2u.jpg) here.
---
Not big into prime stuff
---
The Top of the World Mezzanine would be a better place for a player hub.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs an amazing idea! Thank you for your response üëéüí©
---
But if the loot was actually good, they might stick around and help. 
---
I have a few pieces of heavy, I think everything besides the chest
---
It didn't used to be. Early on whitesprings was somewhat ignored by higher levels and actually has a few associated quests (Order of Mysteries and the ghoul golfers one) that can take place at pretty low level. Once people realized how high the spawn rate was for high level/legendary ghouls and the amount of XP earned vs effort required it became a popular grinding spot, especially after a nuke. Bethesda tried to counter that some by lowering the XP per kill to make it less appealing and to encourage people to explore elsewhere but it's still one of the most common places
---
No, you can't take VATS or stealth boys or chameleon armor etc...
---
That's Fallout. 
---
There does need to be a balance pass to make weapons a bit more even, especially the TSE ones.
---
thanks i‚Äôm going to check it out right now
---
i‚Äôve almost got all of the regular but no heavy
---
Tell them to get over it XD 
---
definitely! trapped in the warehouse at Blackwater mine with the Supervisor, low on ammo. 2 scorchbeasts outside and damn scorched everywhere..it took longer than I expected to black out, but it saved my life for sure.
---
We have 12 year old that are completing ‚Äútake a selfie while drunk and naked‚Äù quests .... 
---
This seems to happen frequently with the automatic barrel which is why I have shelved my tesla rifle for the time being.
---
After engaging in a lengthy 30+ minute battle in survival, something needs re-working. I think lower levels receive less damage than higher levels(just a straight guess) cause they seem to take more bullets to kill. Also is their a range that berry mentats do not work? Had a chameleaon pa gun cripple me repedidly with a shot gun from 80+ meters away every shot( only died by him once) but I could never seem him or anything. Like is there something that makes berry mentats not work on u? If you were at white springs around 6am-7am on my server. Sorry if u we're in cross fire, 3 group battle.
---
As for the op, you have to go all on on pa build or an armor build, or a pvp build, or a sneak build. Just go all in with one build and get perks with ur legendary effects that stack
---
Same people need to get over it. Ive had issues with all substances also. Dont bother me. Just keep your noes clean.
---
You do know you can completely ignore them and not participate in those, right? I was not even aware they were there until someone pointed them out and I looked for them.  Just like their are bars  in your town, just don't participate.
---
frikin' laser beams...
---
Think they are saying they don't do much damage
---
Ah, that is my fault for not reading better.
---
I could get behind removing crits. Having auto aim that gives a minimum of 100% damage increase is a bit absurd in my opinion.
---
well actually there is at least a thrusting animation but that only works when using spears of forks when not in PA. Also, any attack speed bonuses from legendary effects for example do not work on spears and forks when using PA, they are stuck with the animations for slow weapons in PA and wont get faster.
---
Hahahahah 
---
I don't use power armor anyway but I've never seen the stab for the spear
---
No.  
---

My text had someone stalking us for 3 hours but I guess.

Soon survival mode will be nothing more than 4 adderall‚Äôd pubescents on one server, killing each other over and over again to prove who has the most pubic hair.
---
And good luck to them. 
---
Exactly, even if I was using the event to hop around cheaply, I'd take a few minutes to scope how the event was going and maybe jump into an event I'd otherwise ignore.  It would help if there was a guaranteed legendary drop too.
---
On adventure or survival?
---
r/ihadastroke
---
I'll sell it all to you, if you want it
---
Adventure. I wouldn't say it if we were in PvP.
---
Feed the People was awesome when it was 'bugged'.  I don't do events but I did that one a few times to "do my part" in feeding the server.  
---
Ironic that Bethesda stopped this when it was a real community builder.
---
Found four ants and one rad rad there once. Just one short, Rad Ant Lager lasts very briefly and I can't craft it, yet.
---
Had this issue since fallout 4 the .50cal should be ALOT more powerful. I literally only make mine into .50 A. it SOUNDS better and B. ammo is cheaper to craft.
---
Gotcha.  There will always be weird people out there I suppose.
---
Reseting all carried food condition to full would be frikkin awesome!
---
That‚Äôs just it.  When it doesn‚Äôt load it‚Äôs just a boarded off door that shows inaccessible.  It‚Äôs because it fails to load the door properly.
---
When loaded it is a metal door.  It happens occasionally.  Rare that it actually persists beyond a couple minutes of standing in front of it, but it does.  Hopping usually makes it load properly but if you hop at Big Al‚Äôs it can take upwards of two minutes for the area, including the metal door, to load in.  
---
We are getting item displays right April 9 or 16. Bobbleheads will be one of them
---
once they take away the possibility that others can damage my CAMP, then I don't mind it being visible.
---
though having said that, it's nice to be surprised once in awhile, stumbling upon another CAMP in the middle of nowhere..
---
Quit being a pussy.
---
It‚Äôs a video game.  Play it or don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt condone violently killing raiders in real life, but do it gleefully in the Fallout universe.
---
I kinda agree but I use to buy every limited time cosmetic from the atomic shop so I wouldn't be happy if they did that. I would get mad at besdaha if they put my blackbird back in the store.
---
I agree with you i got lucky and had someone help me because of this thread but you have a point with not wanting to bother people to help transfer items. Fingers crossed that Bethesda will figure out how to implement this feature.
---
Bethesda*
---
Honestly their isn't a best weapon, it's just your build that matters
---
You can still use mods, but every patch changes the ini.  
---
You have to rebuild a new custom ini using the latest Fallout76.ini.
---
This would explain all the bugs.XD. 
---
Keep trying guy I carry the same duped gauss you probably have with 15 perception 
---
Nah you are just stealth lol
---
How much agility do you have and what kind of armor, weapon etc
---
Even if it wasn't free people are still going to gather there. They are putting all faction vendors there.
---
Cant imagine anyone doing the leaps around the world to sell stuff if they can pay once to sell to all vendors. 
---
I may have an unpopular opinion but putting all vendors in one spot, it is more than fair to pay once to get there.
---
Caps are super easy to get and will be even easier to save once all vendors are in one spot.
---
I tried doing this challenge but my Mountain Honey Moonshine disappeared from my stash box :(
---
WERE YOU GUYS SPYING ON ME AND MY FRIENDS YESTERDAY? literally had this same conversation 
---
Where is that program located ?
---
You kill 20 people, who lost caps when you killed them = fun.
---
You die twice, and lose caps = rules are crap.
---
We're all up against the same thing.
---
Literally yesterday I was playing my lvl 13 character on PS4, and I've joined "Back on the beat" event in Morgantown. It was already started, some dude approached first safe room with Steelheart, and all I hoped for from this event was single action revolver that is in third safe room under the desk. 
---
So as you see no big hopes for the event, it was never amazing to me. BUT yesterday was different, as beside us two a group of four people approached. And holly heck! I never seen so much ghouls before!  My knuckles literally broke in the mid fight and had to continue with bare hands! It was a blast! 
---
Then I got my revolver and thought we are done - nope! We all of sudden heart sirens from Airport as "Final Departure" began, and we all went there! Now seven people fighting hordes of Scorched! 
---
This game needs some proper mechanics to bring people together for these events. Dunno, some server wide message what events are currently available (maybe mark favorites), better &amp; transparent rewards for bigger number of people, and yeah, no payment for fast travel could be nice as well!
---
OMFG NOW I'VE SEEN IT ALL
---
You are NOT the only one.  I live a straight edge lifestyle for personal reasons.  I do not judge anyone who chooses a different lifestyle.  I really enjoy the game even though it has many problems. I used to do all the challenges.  Now I don't even look at them anymore.  I'm just too sick of drink alcohol, craft alcohol, do this while intoxicated.  One once in awhile is fine but it's gotten completely out of hand.  How no one at Bethesda could see this as alienating some fans is beyond me.  This may come as a surprise, but not everyone drinks and does drugs.  I know it's extremely popular within modern culture; trust me I know!  I've been an outcast too often.  But not EVERYONE partakes.  
---
Saw an earlier post saying you can kill bees after drinking honey moonshine and it will work.  Did not confirm myself yet.
---
I‚Äôve had a similar thing happen with the XO-1. I was able to craft just one leg of the woodland camo for it after buying the separate wasteland camo... I assume it‚Äôs a glitch too. 
---
They did get slightly nerfed back in Patch 6, I believe, in that they increased the time in between their green Cheerio attack.
---
My OCD is telling me that you should have centered it on the road...
---
I think seeing the mess that is survival mode just makes people appreciate adventure mode
---
They fixed Feed the People, and yet the flowers quest that gives **Corpse flower stamen** is still bugged and gives it server wide. Why fix the one people *actually* wanted to keep ?
---
People love to make their own problems other people's problems. Also, this post is bound to get tons of upvotes because it "shows support to minorities". Totally agree with you. It's not like these challenges are a core part of the game as well. I'm level 134 and never gave a shit about challenges. 
---
Alcoholism is not a disease; I know, because I was once an alcoholic, and now I'm not.  You say this is not the place for philosophy; well, "alcoholism is a disease that can never be cured" is a philosophy.
---
Yup. Have an upvote.
---
This should have been the standard paint.  Dunno why they persist with that stupid helmet look.
---
Same experience-ish. I bash and shoot two, and three-star legendaries in Watoga every day, including last night. The L50 two-star, and three-star I bashed last night did not explode. However, a L38, which I did not notice as legendary, exploded, and flew away...never to be seen again. Note, nerd rage seems to help me avoid death in most cases, but not all. 
---
I suppose that's the problem with reintroducing those items, but I feel like it mostly applies to things like the Blackbird paint... less so a pair of pink glasses or a cute poodle dress. Or any other comparably frivolous item.
---
(I say this only because I've yet to see anyone vocally determined for items like that, whereas the Blackbird paint has a very large number of people clamouring for its reintroduction!)
---
There should be a campfire next to their name on the friend list if they're in survival.  
---
The sim theory is a neat idea, but there's far too many things Vault-Tec wouldn't have known about or wanted Vault Dwellers to know about for it to make sense. For instance, the Brotherhood formed very soon to the Great War, and it's unlikely Vault Tec would quickly patch them into the simulation, so to speak. 
---
We know for a fact that simulations like Operation Anchorage and Tranquility Lane aren't that complicated, either. Anchorage was a one person simulation where all of its parts were sentient in very limited ways, and Tranquility Lane was tiny, not to mention a personal gift to Braun iirc.
---
Personally, I really dislike 'it was just a dream' as a story-telling device because it takes any and all impact out of the story at hand.
---
We can always jumpstart that war ;)
---
I hear you man. Trying to play Fallout or ME3 while quitting cigs, made it a lot more difficult. I played video games as the escape, end up being triggered. 
---
I'm fine with it now, but there was a 6 month period where I played No Mans Sky. 
---
Me too, I‚Äôm high level but I‚Äôd probably use the cheap travel but then stick around to get the rewards (particularly rare outfits)
---
Drugs have always given superpowers in Fallout games. There really are no good messages. 
---
Yeah, by the time I get everything together half the stuff has gone bad.  Not worth the inventory space.  I don't even keep most foods that spoil now.  I gorge and dump anything that spoils.  
---
This is a seriously undervoted comment. This thread is unbelievable. Some asshole buys a game that is rating M and is known to feature drugs and alcohol, and now is complaining about it.  
---
Dumbass OP needs to start playing games like "Ready, Set, Grover," "Lego City," or "Yoshi's Island." 
---
Still have any of that tech data on ps4
---
All new weapons or crossbow; source? I know energy explosive weapons are legacy now.
---
on the subject of bugged tesla rifles, my two shot tesla rifle does exactly the same damage as a regular tesla rifle, also why didn't they get the 10% damage boost other energy weapons did?  I haven't checked in awhile but did they ever fix the animation bug on charging ones that turned you into a blob of armor while holding the charge?
---
OP is illogical and his post is the height of self-centered douchebaggery.
---
Ps4
---
I agree.
---
No it's not.
---
Still a few who will follow you, trying to jump in front if your shot to trigger PvP.
---
I think there are more people playing survival. At least on ps4 when I play adventure the servers are not full and most players are very low level.
---
That's cause most of the murder hobos are on survival camping vault 76 entrance.
---
pvp don't need to change. Just make the robots one shot kill any player who attacks anyone in whitesprings.
---
It could be a great player hub.
---
There's more holes in that then there is proof.
---
The first one is clearly the crazed ramblings of an enclave member. If if it's not why hook us up to the same sim as the enclave?
---
The second point who made the sim? You say vault tec but how could they predict things like the BoS or scorched why include such dangerous and incriminating evidence like the overseer saying she knew of the experiments or west tek.
---
The last point is just regular life.
---
No but id like to know how I had more than 100,000 rare items I've never had more than 20,000 of any ammo type usually between 5000 and 15000 of multiple types that bought, sold and crafted because I'm sure however they calculated it was counting stuff twice 
---
This may sound like a stupid question but do you actually have to hit a button for crates to activate? Like I'm PlayStation the crits button flashes triangle going to hit triangle nothing ever happens. Am I doing it wrong?
---
I see where their coming from. I‚Äôve been a stealth marksman for nearly 130 levels and just the past couple of weeks have I been giving them the what for. 
---
Only difference I‚Äôve noticed from my end is my armour is missing one piece of chameleon. 
---
Pacifist mode is love. 
---
Sender and receiver need to be registered firearms dealers for interstate transfers.  You could have your local FFL (federal firearms license) ship it to Todd's FFL, who would run the mandatory background check on Todd before giving it to him.  
---
Fees at both ends, of course, it's still the government.
---
That or trying to spend 30s trying dance on each kill they make. 
---
Especially patching in creatures that were only seen after the dropping of the bombs. 
---
Deathclaws
---
Mirelurks
---
Unless Vault-Tec complied a very a accurate biological list of animals and mutations than I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs possible. 
---
I'd like to add that it seems ants like to spawn in and out front of kerwood mine in the bog, as well as in the thunder mountain(?) Substation in the bog
---
Not to mention the dirt pile is incredibly out of sync with the animation of the burrowing creature. Sometimes, if it hasn't spawned yet, the pile with show up upon killing them, *just because*. 
---
Nope. Survival mode was the real game/mode all along. 
---
To add for the Rad Ant Lager - you can also find Rad Ants over at Lucky Hole Mine near Fort Defiance and as well at Dolly Sods 
---
Anybody on Xbox have brick wall plans, tell me your name and I will trade for them üôÉü§ô
---
Please also remove this unwonted violence and the abillity to kill other players as this reminds me of the days I was a serial killer and it is making me get those urges again even though I'm  not actually killing people and know it's pretend. May I suggest you redesign 76 survival mode from PVP to FVF... Farmer vs Farmer where we could have a "farm off"against each other...fuck yer real escapism 
---
I went on yesterday and the top player has been alive for 11 hours with a 15k bounty. 
---
What the fuck 
---
I wasn't taking into account any upgraded clothing. The way OP made it seem to me was they were looking for base clothing, no upgrades. I actually kinda forgot about the under armor upgrades doing stat boosts
---
The tattered dress gives an effect? Really? I never noticed
---
Hey also, if you're having trouble farming screws I would recommend going to easier areas than Sugar Grove for them. The Charleston Herald building has some typewriters and a few fans, and anywhere that spawns low level super mutants would be good too. I believe New Gad and Summersville should spawn some pretty easy super mutants you could clear out for screws and other junk.
---
Here are mine
---
-AMS corporate headquarters(watoga)
---
-Watoga emergency services building
---
-Flooded train yard (east of watoga)
---
-Sugar grove outside, sometimes inside
---
-West tek 
---
-Whitesprings(obviously)
---
-And some of the other watoga buildings occasionally have some but not as often
---
-West tek
---
-one up in the mire. The area around dolly sods campground will spawn legendary animals. 
---
Basically higher level areas. Cranberry bog is where I find most of mine when I‚Äôm farming.  But I don‚Äôt play on survival right now so idk how those places are as far as pvp goes
---
Yeah, fuck getting grants Saber at low levels
---
Deathclaws were a military project before the war. As to if they were mobile is unsure. 
---
And there‚Äôs the terminal in FO4 that states that crabs and lobsters are starting to show signs of evolution. Pre war.

Thank you for posting this. I strongly agree with your sentiments. I‚Äôve been sober for a few years now and while I don‚Äôt get the same desire to drink I used to from various triggers, it is still frustrating how often online games present drinking as just a fun silly goof that you‚Äôre expected to do for points. I get that it‚Äôs a game, and it really isn‚Äôt that big a deal, but at the end of the day... giving people achievement points or currency for simulated substance abuse is fucked up. It‚Äôs a weird thing to just have as a given in so many online games.
---
Makes sense but still. 
---
Bloat flies mutated well after the war. Since the release of 76. The first appearance of these creatures has been Appalachia. 
---
No worries. Just shoot me a message when you're good to go
---
Haven't heard about the Dolly Sods one, thanks. I'll give those areas a shot.
---
I tend to agree with you, but do keep in mind that most of those plants can be found in grow boxes in various facilities.  They *could* give us that as a camp item to grow the more rare or difficult varietals.
---
Even so, just exploring has given me an overall idea on where to go to get these plants, and most of what I actively farm these days is flux...
---
I spent days farming mats for ammo and got banned for it. I had over 90k 50 cal rounds legitimately. 
---
ok
---
Not sure, to be honest. I just assumed that combination of effects had been disabled altogether. 
---
Camden Perk events have the potential to trigger anytime you set foot in what the game considers the Ash Heap.  You could be at Charleston FD, the park itself, or clear over in Lewisburg.
---
Yeah legendary gulpers, anglers, and occasionally a Yao guai next door at the cabin
---
Oh also there was a guarantee one way back in the day but I think they patched it. It was the Yao guai that spawned in the back of the civil war cemetery 
---
Well your first problem is that you spawned at Whitespring. Survival has an issue right now with lag, ping, and world loading. Popular spawnpoints are being camped (not an FO76 specific problem) and because the campers don't have to load the world there is a time difference between when you spawn in and when they see you spawn in. That's why you have died at load.
---
Solution: Stop spawning to popular points that get camped.
---
Responses to your suggestions:
---
1) Tod the almighty has mentioned that they allowed everyone to port their adventure characters so that we can all break the game during the BETA period. I am not sure what the plan will be post beta but the idea of seasons has been brought up where you would have to create a new character for each specific season and each season would have slightly different rules.
---
2) You may be one shot but you can also one shot them (as long as they don't have Sentinel Assassin gear or serendipity). There is very little difference in pvp between a lvl 12 with a shotgun and a lvl 200 with a BE weapon. The pvp damage mechanics do not in any way equate with the pve paper damage listed on a weapon. I can kill someone with a standard 10mm pistol in 3 shots or kill someone with a bloodied explosive handmade in 3 shots. The best weapon for 1-shot kills right now is any shotgun. They kill in 1-2 hits. I suggest a semi-auto handmade for people who use vats or an LMG for non-vats users. The best perks are those that reduce damage by a percentage. Any perks that increase armor are useless. Armor is basically useless. Serendipity, dodgy, fireproof, etc is where its at for pvp perks.
---
3) I agree that we need some kind of negative punishment for those who pvp with no caps
---
Oh really?   I had just noticed it doing it in the past week or so.  Maybe I just don‚Äôt go to the ash heap enough.  
---
Plus survival gives people an outlet for their crazy and can leave the rest of us alone
---
They need to increase how many caps you get on events. The only one worth doing for caps to travel cost if manhunt  which is 120caps. The other events only give 20 to 60 which is over the cost of travel or just on the cost to travel. They also need to give a better chance at plans. I have done distant thunder way to many times now no not be able to craft a full suit of power armor. 
---
That could be, or they are creating their survival player/build.  Having a survival character is something I‚Äôve considered.
---
LoL
---
Dodgy is an agility perk. It reduces damage taken per hit at the cost of AP. 
---
At rank three, hits do 30% less damage but lose 30 AP per hit as well. 
---
Idk I've tried joining friends and this is the most 'world is full' that I have seen since launch. 
---
I think it‚Äôs chance to fill up crit meter and chance to find weapon or armor with higher condition.
---
The disease one is endurance
---
You should have known this wasn't going to go over well lol
---
Feeling down buddy ? Lets crack open a cold one !
---
Berry Mentats are your friend.
---
Explain this "Hoarding of crits". Crit banking doesnt exist in FO76. The best you can do is make sure that your crit meater is full when starting pvp. You can do the same.
---
Dear Bethesda, a word on your food sources from person suffering from pica.  
---
Please chill with the canned dog food, radroach meat, and other noxious food sources. Some players might be recovering or actively suffering from pica (you're never cured), and I'd rather not remember those days when I disgusted and shocked friends and family by chowing down on dog food, insects, and spoiled meat.  
---
Dear Bethesda, a word on lockpicking from person suffering from kleptomania.  
---
Please chill with the necessity of lockpicking skills. Some players might be recovering or actively suffering from kleptomania (you're never cured), and I'd rather not remember those days when I hurt friends and family by picking locks and committing theft.
---
Anyone know if he survived?
---
They really did overdo it. Nearly every challenge wants Alcohol now and the current weekly has been annoying to complete since I don't own all the recipes yet since they're random from daily and not all of them for the "consume different types" seem to be buy-able and the trade-able recipe drops are pretty rare. 
---
I'm stuck at 22/25 and 13/15. I guess they wanted us to make alts and get every character on our account drunk just to finish these.
---
Got disconnected right before we killed her. Literally seconds away from getting decent loot and exp:/
---
I agree they will probably be very popular. The thing is that growing section of my playtime is organising a teams to fight each other, and wich such playstyle and such organised fights our access to unrestricted PvP and both our well-researched characters allow us to have a super satisfying and friendly encounters that usually end up with a party.
---
Theres a location thats a blast for PvP - Cranberry Glade. Having two opposing teams each one with a camp on opposing side of Cranberry Glade can be a source of fun so immense, that I believe it should be allowed to remain.
---
I'm not opposed to your needs and I support it. I'm just voicing my own needs in hope people will see their validity and value and will support that too.
---
I actually have a better point. I don't worry about getting a workshop for power cores or anything else for that matter. I counted last nite and had 28 power cores. Was giving them away. I know where so many of them spawn it's not an issue. Granted average charge is only about 60 or 70 percent but with 28 who cares?
---
I agree with this, you can have some events themed around your content like this but the constant focus on it can be damaging, excessive and sends the wrong message about substance abuse. I think it doesn't feel as real with the drugs because they are all fake things like psycho and buffout and to me feel more like potions or scrolls but the liquor is harder to separate from your own struggles and I can see how that can transfer out of the game. I don't think they should remove it or anything just don't make it the focus for atoms it's gamifying alcoholism. 
---
I‚Äôm always poppin em it‚Äôs a must right now. With regards to Crits, Check out perks 4 leaf clover, grim reaper sprint, critical saavy, better Crits 
---
Items aren‚Äôt inherently valuable just because they are rare, especially in an apocalypse.
---
Dear Bethesda, a word on your post-nuclear environment.  
---
Please chill with your nuclear holocaust theme.  Some players might be descendants of residents of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, or Pripyat (you're never really cured of the memories of a post-apocalyptic hellscape), and I'd rather not remember those days when we were forced out of our home, Uncle Gorsha grew another limb, and I shocked friends and family with my skin sloughing off.
---
I just joined a survival game yesterday, and was instantly spawn killed over and over. So, that's how I learned. 
---
Or..you know. The guy selling all serum recipes for 2k each over and over in the marketplace yesterday? I dont believe for a second duping has been eliminated.
---
Dear Bethesda, a word on your "dying of thirst" construct.  
---
Please chill with your survival challenges. Some players might still be suffering from the effects of severe dehydration (you're never the same), and I'd rather not remember my days lost in the Gobi when I had to drink my own piss and squeeze moisture out of camel dung.
---
I'm a vats cavalier that thought himself the king because how freefragy were the people sporting the most expensive assassin sentinel gear. I consider that so-called meta 3rd tier now. I'm 2nd tier until my alt is leveled. 1st tier is unyielding sneakbuild.
---
all but STR should do more with this train of thought. all the other stats have about the same amount of advantages with STR having the most.  
---
imo all luck would need is to boost %'s of existing
---
chance to do x cards
---
1. plan from scrap, probably would fit better under INT
---
2. plan from event, iirc CHA is supposed to affect those rewards already
---
3. stealth, pretty sure AGI covers it already
---
4. desease, would fit much better in END, pretty sure it already does though especially since end had a perk for it
---
5. fall damage, imo would fall under agi, agi already has a perk for it
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone pretends it doesn‚Äôt need work. I think people just enjoy it regardless, all the while keeping knowledge of what needs work. I wouldn‚Äôt play it if I wasn‚Äôt enjoying it. So it‚Äôs that simple. Play it if you enjoy it.
---
It sounds like you have taken a personal task of being the games ambassador. That‚Äôs fine and all but that was your prerogative. No one is gonna play a game unless they enjoy it. And you can‚Äôt convince someone to enjoy it unless they do it on their own. 
---
The game is not dying. Not yet.  
---
Haha, my Lever Action has the same effect. I really hope we will be able to change weapon names someday.
---
I still think the simulation theory is a plausible scenario for 76, if an A.I. Like Modus is capable of understanding the outside world so could the VSS or whatever Vault-Tec is using, also player impact in the lore in 76 is minimal so the simulation theory wouldn‚Äôt take away too much from the lore compared to the story of NV or even Fo4.
---
That being said we might never get a concrete answer kinda like all the other theories surrounding synths in Fallout 4.
---
Ahaha man that won‚Äôt be for another 200 years, actually I‚Äôm pretty sure we worked together up until the events of Fo3 üòÇ
---
I suspect there was a nerf of all weapons across the board to deal less damage to minimise OTK frequencies in Survival (and Adventure)
---
1000%
---
Dear Bethesda, a word on your "Leader of the Pack" event.
---
Please chill with your events based on killing canines. Some players might still be suffering depression and anxiety from seeing their childhood pet put down (you're never really cured of the pain after you shoot Ole Yeller), and I'd rather not remember those days when I hurt so bad and cried myself to sleep thinking about Ole Yeller.
---
I would do it for free
---
Yes and no. 
---
We had a friends bar destroyed last night. Fine, we (6 of us) came and killed him and his little friends. Then he respawns and comes back. Taunting everyone. Knowing that there are ZERO consequences until he fires the first shot. He does a few times and is quickly dispatched. 
---
But that is the 'No' part. You cant kill someone that truly deserves it
---
I never had an issue of the former slap damage. Then again, I've never been griefed
---
Not wanting to do that event. At all. I have seen that event pop up many times and actively ignored it.
---
Damn that sucks 
---
I'm a Vats crit build, it's not working the way you think it does. In pvp i can kill my target in 2 shots, without crits.
---
If i use crits in pvp is usually to be sure i'll hit my target, not to deal damage. To generate a crit you need to hit your target 2-3 times. If you do hit your target 2-3 times that target is most likely dead anyway. Oh, and VATS headshots deal bonus damage anyway, no need to crit it.
---
A good player could aim better than my vats anyway so removing these guaranteed shots won't fix anything.
---
Well now I am.
---
It wasn‚Äôt me, but some people, like me, don‚Äôt craft shitloads of weapons. We‚Äôll find or craft a weapon that we like, mod it to our liking, and repair it periodically, but otherwise don‚Äôt really mess with the crafting tables.
---
I have over 100 screws (not sure about gears, but a little bit less (while I‚Äôve seen posts about people struggling to find enough screws just to repair their weapons).
---
Tl;dr: it‚Äôs possible that whoever left them does minimal crafting and maximum hoarding. 
---
True. We were 20 gears away from completing our X-01 mats and they came out of nowhere and one shotted us and took all our junk in the blink of an eye. Really not sure how they we so quick and able to be in a different spot than where they we on the map.
---
Ouch that sucks but I know the feeling all to well 
---
They are patching new items in a lot lately. But I believe last one was first part of the week. If you check this reddit I believe there's more info on it and what's in the next few patches. Seems they are going all out to save 76. Opening vaults and more.
---
My problem is with the people who shut down any and all criticism for the game, zealously defending something that is really quite indefensible.  And I have enjoyed the game, as I noted in my post.  I would just enjoy it more (and still *be* enjoying it) if more time was spent fixing existing problems instead of introducing new ones and patching back in old ones.
---
I hope they will both leave the existing things as they are AND implement seasonal fresh out the vault experience because every F76 player deserves to feel the Reclaimation day.
---
Daily Quests work like that.
---
There's also mirelurk queens, which certainly couldn't have been predicted, as well as Mole Miners, etc. Vault Tec didn't even manage to make sure 81 got an Overseer willing to carry out the experiment, so it's nigh unlikely they managed to accurately simulate the post war world. 
---
Go play Farmville 
---
I've seen a damage increase on my charging Tesla rifle. It went from about 190 damage (with all three Rifleman perk cards maxed out) to now being around 210. Nothing else changed for me to increase this damage other than the update...
---
That's not hoarding crits. That is just maximizing returns. BTW I am well aware of crit mechanics. I wrote a post on how 4 leaf clover and psycopath are worthless if you have max luuck and crit savy. 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0o6ly/luck\_critical\_perks\_and\_diminishing\_returns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0o6ly/luck_critical_perks_and_diminishing_returns/) 
---
Grim Reapers isn't a crit perk, and better crits only increases crit damage and is inferior to bloody mess for overall damage increase of build. Haven't written that post up yet.
---
It‚Äôs too true 
---
It was like black and had like normal teeth, kind of looked like the tooth man mask I had but was black.
---
A lot of words were said, statistically, some of them should be good, but they weren't.
---
You're right, but I think we could make just this one exception.
---
Well the nerfs made sbq way more difficult, and recent whitespring spawn nerfs made glowing ghouls a one and done tour of duty.  You can't be a true casual and do nuke drops anymore. You're either min/maxing for dps on queen or organizing to get your tags in on the ghouls in a group.
---
A means to enable selected event notifications would be most welcome. Real rewards must include legendary drops and/or a chance at a plan. Ammo and chems only as rewards in events needs to stop ASAP. 
---
üëå
---
I‚Äôm glad it created some discussion for sure. Was just wondering what other people thought. It‚Äôs clear that most people are using Vats and the only way to counter is stealth and that‚Äôs the reason PVP isn‚Äôt for me right now. But again that‚Äôs just my opinion. 
---
Mmm I feel like that's the case. My level 35 gear vs lvl 20-25 beasts used to do 1/4+ damage but now it just dents.
---
Although I admit server stability has been a bit worse the last week or so, I find adventure mode to be in a pretty stable state. 
---
As for survival, that‚Äôs a beta.
---
You accused me of deleting it.  So you're still wrong dumb ass.   Damn snitch
---
Whilst all of your points are perfectly valid, I'm not sure why you felt the need to make a list of "excuses"? Personally, I don't play many online games for the exact reasons you have given. However, it has not helped that the community have deemed fit to exploit bugs and glitches for commercial gain which has meant the devs spending valuable time to remove the bugs and ban/suspend players. This in turn has led to toxic debates on here about who's right or wrong. Being an older gamer, I always thought my hobby was a fun way to pass time, yet here we are with even more debate about a game not delivering what was expected. I do sympathize with those that paid full price, and a no refund policy. But that is business today. As most things on life we move forward and hopefully put disappointment behind us.
---
This guy is a very old, hardened shitposter on this sub. I kinda enjoy his stuff, actually.
---
Stealthboys are horrible in survival. If your shoot or swing, you should be revealed 
---
The one shot kills are rather ridiculous.
---
But if we are looking for ‚Äúrealism‚Äù most people in real life don‚Äôt survive more than 1 shot to the head....  :-/
---
&gt; In-game drugs and alcohol are cringe-inducing for most of us non-incels over the age of 15.  
---
After such a devastatingly reasonable argument, I guess I have no choice but to sign your change.org petition to ban any depiction of such immoral acts in video games.
---
I agree but only way to counter Vats Crits builds especially bloodied ones so can‚Äôt get rid of one without the other. Is what it is for now 
---
After such a devastatingly reasonable argument, I guess I have no choice but to sign your online petition to ban any depiction of such immoral acts in video games.
---
Only Opposums, Squirrels and Rabbits drop them.
---
You should be able to ‚Äúview profile‚Äù and see a send message option. I guess it depends on the system you‚Äôre on. If you‚Äôre on Xbox, the option to send message appears before add friend on their profile page. 
---
Like ultracite pa then.
---
Ive got an AAE version. It tears anything a second and third and possibly more assholes
---
Critters still drop them.  A bunch of oppossums around Flatwoods. 
---
Deletes your mule
---
Nope.  I have been playing all morning with full servers.  
---
You are responsible for you. If you are unable to handle the cartoon violence, you should probably stick to games that don't include cartoon violence. Asking Bethesda to be responsible for you is unfair to the rest of us who enjoy the game the way it is. 
---
Why would an innocent player go on there anyway? It's quite open about what it is.
---
Handmade is now by the far the most powerful weapon. They nerfed melee and high-powered one shot weapons really hard 
---
Lol. I think they should have unbanned the banned players on April first and then rebanned them the next day.
---
You evil bastard
---
Canned meat stew from feed the people event gives 5% xp too.
---
You can also get honey from irrational fear event location, and from sweetwater's dailies
---
Never thought of using it as an escape rope, might take one with me from now on.
---
Adventure mode has actually improved since the Survival Beta, but I'm kind of expecting it to be the same old story in a week or so when the people who moved to Survival get tired of being one-shotted and spawn killed.
---
I use that and pacifying scorchchbeasts. Spam pacify, fast travel!
---
Mine doesn‚Äôt?   What platform are you playing on?
---
Could we get the ability to combine two level one cards to make a level two when we already have a higher card with more upgrade space (e.g. - 3 of 6 max.)? The current UI forces you to add your level one cards to the highest card in the deck if it isn't at max. Ideally let me breakdown combined cards and/or delete them as well. 
---
What am I "dodging," exactly. The OP's point is that his addiction is my problem. Your problem. Bethesda's problem. And if Bethesda continues to include those temptations in the game, it will send him down a dark path or...something.
---
If he can't handle being exposed to an element that has been common since Fallout 1, then it's his responsibility to quit -- just like he would learn in an AA meeting. Instead, he is whining that Bethesda needs to change things for him.
---
If anything, Bethesda should add a daily AA quest. That'd be hilarious. This idea comes from a friend who plays as we were laughing at the OP here. He just got his one-year chip and has no issue with the alcohol dailies past that their frequency is annoying. If they became a problem, he would quit the game to remove the temptation rather than whine that Bethesda needs to tone it down with the alcohol. 
---
Melees dmg has been nerfed really hard after last update. Takes 2-4 swings now, since the first 1-2 just don‚Äôt do anything. Most handmades will
---
Just shred you at point blank while that BS is happening. Melees been nerfed 
---
Man, I'm glad. I was hoping this was a shit post but with stuff I've seen on here lately. I dont know what's real anymore. 
---
It‚Äôs still in game get dem sausages!!
---
They rarely tell you about this feature!
---
They need to take a look at all weapons and add a few things to some of them, 10mm smg has no sights...
---
One if the most badass pics I've ever seen
---
Amen to that, friend.
---
Id say hiring the modders for the skins is way more resonable than saying fire the whole staff and replace them with modders for the base game one guy said it and wasnt understanding you cant just do that alot of game devs are veterans and modders (by god i love them) arent always a 10 year plus game dev with lots of work in the field and some really dont wanna work for company they just wanna make mods for games 
---
I guess I‚Äôm just having bad luck. I‚Äôll let you in on a little secret before I delete this thread. If you substitute whatever meat you‚Äôre using with human the flavor of the sausages is improved many times over 
---
Absolutely childish comments, you should be ashamed of yourself, and grow up. 
---
PS4, doesn't happen all the time but annoying af of you relog and your junk is gone
---
Wait all are the vendors are actually getting added to the Whitespring? :O
---
It comes up every time you level up beyond 50. I'm not sure you need to be told.
---
BETA is probably to try and cover up the shitness of it 
---
The assaultron head also has the damage bug issue after charging it more then twice. 
---
Concentrated fire fro every perk pack starting the level after I already maxed it
---
I haven‚Äôt noticed anything changed in adventure. At least not against non-players.  I still do the same amount of damage with my lever action.  
---
That stuck with me too. Here we are playing a simulation which may itself be a simulation in that simulated world.
---
We're at this end wondering if even *THIS* itself is a simulation. If it is, did Bethesda program it too?
---
It was his first character and he refused to go to adventure because ‚Äúhe wanted to PvP‚Äù
---
Why would their parents let them play Fallout? It has an "M" rating and actually earns it.
---
I thought that earlier but realised I was shooting everything in the leg üòÇ
---
I just want the game to tell me what level the event is at so I don‚Äôt waste my time doing a low level event. Definitely wanna experience the ones I haven‚Äôt done before though
---
Yep, having a small group of modders as a support team whose job it is to come up with new weapons and features would do a lot for the game.  
---
Teh mod team, works on new concepts while the main team refines. 
---
Grind out levels and don't do any main quests until after level 50 (I went to 55 to be safe). You will lock yourself in at lower level weapon and armor rewards at anything under 50. 
---
I‚Äôm better than you
---
This guys a shitposter. Not that much of a troll, just shitposts. Does it on this and other subs too.
---
Since the reveal I have been against VATS for PVP. It just stupid. Take Overwatch, if you are bad at Aim play something that doesn't require aim, like Rein. Same should be with F76- If you are bad at aim, play melee. But nooo, F76- You bad at aim, here use autoaim. 
---
And WTF is going on with Stimpacks? They told you are not able to spam them in Survival mode. 
---
It's been common after the latest update. If you see a lot of pictures in the markets, most of them are blank like that. If you keep trying to display the stats, they will eventually show up
---
IMO it should only reset if a set number of players do the event like 8-10. 
---
Yeah I saved of my quantum‚Äôs to make a batch of these grenades and wasn‚Äôt pleased. It seems like the normal Nuka ones had a larger damage and radius.
---
Yeah it's pretty bare bones aswell. 
---
You've got to eat your victims. Prior to teabagging. Waste not.
---
Don‚Äôt know why my comment was downvotedü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I also don‚Äôt know why parents allow their kids to play M rated games. But they do. 
---
Just found that out when I was over encumbered and in my first haunt through the glass caverns. Put me pretty close to my camp.
---
Minecraft is calling you home, my friend.  
---
Thank you
---
If/when you ignore it you might be making it harder for the lower levels to actually finish.  
---
Umm, duh? I thought it would have been clear the way I phrased it but okay. I know Fallout was never about that, don't assume this is my first foray into the franchise.
---
"It sounds fun."- a new concept for this franchise, sure, I'm in. And then it got bastardized. So now, I can get my PvP jollies with Borderlands, nbd.
---
Too violent and scary
---
Never thought about using it when Im overencumbered. That‚Äôs a great idea. 
---
you should see what he makes me do.
---
EXISTENCE IS PAIN!
---
I certainly don't think it's bad, ultimately I just feel like there has to be some balance between the end spectrum power builds (full legendary armor sets with x perk) and normal players.
---
Even as a guy running around at a high level with a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet I feel like I'd rather have everyone stand a good chance against each other.
---
It has been blank for me for a while now.
---
Midwest here. I just tried to launch in to the game and got insta disconnected. Now can‚Äôt get in at all. 
---
The Blade of Bastet can actually be upgraded.
---
I always enjoy when I‚Äôm on a roof or better yet, a steel mesh catwalk and I see a mole rat burrow underground and pop up out of the pike of trash next to me. 
---
"Hate i was able to leave"
---
Lol
---
Maybe dont leave . 
---
Just do a different event , some players don‚Äôt like to share 
---
That‚Äôs a good point.  The user seems to be low level it‚Äôs possible they just unlocked more perks in concentrated fire and are targeting parts they did not previously target.  
---
That's what I'm doing. I started a new character for survival, no way I use my main there again.
---
My mate has it, 100% confirmed watch out for a vid on rifle gaming‚Äôs YouTube channel soon
---
everyone gets a rare drop of a two shot, instigating, furious, anti armor, explosive weapon, that after the 5th hit shatters and disappears from inventory..
---
Best to just go in with a higher level of player, grab it and get out. That's how I did it at around level 25 too. A couple who were level 90ish helped me.
---
I have seen myriad posts suggesting hotswapping loadouts, it was never intended to be used that way, rather to experiment with different play styles, I don't see them adding a loadout system any time soon.
---
I don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs for the low levels who ‚Äúwant a challenge‚Äù
---
That doesn‚Äôt excuse the fact that you had spawncamped him in his own camp.
---
Rad scorpions are the worst on this. I was going to post a complaint post myself but got lazy so glad you did it. What I honestly hate most is they always know where you are. When you get caution when sneaking it is supposed to mean they sense you are somewhere but don‚Äôt know where you are. But scorpions will always immediately teleport right to you if they sense you. Doesn‚Äôt even matter if you move from where you are at. And if you think mole rats chasing you forever are bad try being chased by scorpions you can‚Äôt beat and can‚Äôt outrun cause they just keep magically teleporting to you. 
---
Make 5 star legendaries drop for a day, make them break the next day.
---
I can tell you he got it on his fourth attempt too
---
The cargo bots by Point Pleasant are the ones called on for drops by the holotapes, I watched one leave the group and it landed in Flatwoods, my theory is they are there as placeholders for server stability, instead of creating one every time a gov aid holotape is used.
---
I would like to see the game world evolve to include some new cities, perhaps even some npcs to live there. We are supposed to be rebuilding, it would be cool to see the progress.
---
Cool, you can still be a griefer in survival
---
I never played those isometric games on their day, they look so claustrophobic to my eye. My first video game was eve-online üôÇ 
---
I don't have a problem with griefing on PC at 200+ hours. Is this like a console thing?
---
Workshop exploit. Find the group that has a workshop, have one in your hunting team trigger the PVP to cause them all to be killable regardless of where in the world, pop them all virtually instantly. Rinse and repeat for caps. 
---
Bethesda really needs to close these loopholes. 
---
I‚Äôll give you 80 caps, a Tin can and 3 10mm rounds?
---
Cranberry bog i believe . Cranberries give crimson and I think ferns give violet (been awhile so might want to double check that) 
---
I just don't understand wine being tarberries. Grapes don't grow in water, wine gives the least benefits of the alcohols, why not make it mutfruit? At this point there is no incentive to make wine at all. There are a handful of places that tarberries grow (yes behind vault Tec agriculture center) but there's only enough to make one wine. I can grow enough crops to make 5-6 whiskies or Bourbons. I can harvest enough snaptails to make 5-6 rums!
---
Thanks for posting this. My Tesla rifle has been sitting in my stash for ages because it‚Äôs unusable.
---
Some people just enjoy a good stalk, watching people from the trees in my occultist outfit with deathclaw gauntlet in hand is my favorite pastime
---
Oh they totally are. They‚Äôre not going to give up on this game for the foreseeable future. 
---
I‚Äôll give it all a look-see when I leave this convention. :)
---
The starting price is 1000 
---
Deathclaws are no longer hostile. I had one with red bar that didn't attack a random in my camp.
---
Now i have a new dclaw and i made sure to pacify it before taming. It's not hostile to anyone but mobs.
---
It‚Äôs his fault he didn‚Äôt leave, or better yet spawn anywhere else. He had a friend who was level 60.
---
I Have 3 Travel Agents... This is just bad
---
Just keep an eye on the WS and go when it's clear or has low levels. Or if you have a Mic, just communicate that you need the sword. Anyone there will likely take a minute or two to cover you while you grab it.
---
Well OP should just continue avoiding doing the challenges for a bit. It's a gimmick to get people to use the new brewing system that was just implemented. I'm sure it will be short lived with all the new stuff they're supposed to be adding. OP just needs to be patient. 
---
You‚Äôre lower saying I can‚Äôt do stuff in survival.
---
Not even an alcoholic and I was having this thought the other day. 
---
It‚Äôs a crazy oversight they‚Äôre not thinking of their players who might be in recovery. 
---
Good luck.  Maybe the first few days when it was hard to find it spawned since everyone was there not allowing it to reset except on a new server. 
---
But now they are abundant.  
---
Don‚Äôt respawn maybe?
---
ITS SURVIVAL whether we asked for it or not here we are
---
Great work! I wish we could use the side lights in-game
---
I assume it's because they were a subgroup of the responders.
---
Hey it‚Äôs double explosive not TSE
---
I am also willing to sell nuka cola t-51b armor
---
Running the Whitespring ghoul fest with your best melee as fast as you can, jump server rinse and repeat and you can level pretty quickly depending on real life commitments.
---
So much virtue signalling in these comment sections 
---
Go play Barbie race and ride. 
---
Hey dude! Just wanted to let you know you‚Äôre an immature loser and you should change that! Take it easy! 
---
Julian would tell you to get fucked and run you out of the trailer park. You‚Äôre more of a Cyrus. 
---
Something tells me you may get your wish when the Backpacks come out. I figure there'll be a Pioneer Scouts model which would resemble the BoS outfit (I can't remember its name, resembles the Firebreather outfit) and hopefully the bedroll will be functional. 
---
If not... well here's your chance Bethesda :P
---
Their team is soooooooo small man. Maybe if some modders volunteered. üôÑ
---
No idea, but I can totally recommend only using orbital strikes with last laugh.
---
They are but they do the more dangerous stuff
---
&gt;make stations and events non killable zones.
---
Yeah, I like that idea.
---
But for now just avoid fast traveling if you can
---
I've been to more fails when the drop site was the battle zone. Lots of places for no-dps-ers to hide.  Almost always get success when the battle takes place near fissure prime or forward station.  It's a bit of a toss up because if you fight her outside the roads you can get fantastic players hitting her with bloodied unarmed hits. Conversely you'll get lvl35 peeps with their executioners 1* hunting rifle taking pot shots.  I'm almost always up for the fight though. 
---
They could easily make it lore friendly: the enclave bunker‚Äôs structural integrity has become compromised due to the constant nuke drops and thusly has led to the enclave marking white springs as a no nuke zone.
---
He has a few options, and because everyone in this sub is a baby when it comes to this game and PvP I‚Äôll explain them to you
---
1. Respawn somewhere else
---
2. Go to a different server
---
3. Switch to adventure
---
4. Stop playing the game
---
And a few more I‚Äôm not going to list because that‚Äôs enough.
---
Tell that philosophy to my cousin's family after he drank himself to death because he couldn't leave it alone even while he knew it was killing him.
---
I‚Äôll give it a shot, thanks!
---
I'm level 166 and have no idea what sword you're talking about. Can somebody Fill Me In?
---
System?
---
Do you have a consistent way to do this? I have tried and failed each time, I miss my perk layout mod.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt have the storage space to secure my aid items to attempt a survival run at the moment.
---
In my pc experience it's rare too. Only happened once to me so far when I was beginning to build my camp the other day. Some dude in a devil mask with a rapid exploding bullet gun destroyed everything and tried to get me to hit him. Sigh...it makes me more wary of visitors now.
---
Since it obviously means so much to you to be right here.  I apologize for saying it was you who deleted it, it was not my intention to offend you in anyway.  
---
But I had a 50/50 chance since I knew it was posted and was gone within a few minutes.
---
The point still remains I did not report it. And it was not the the whole time we discussed it and despite all the names and other stuff you said about me in the end your just a random internet stranger and I don't care what you think about me because you don't even know the first thing about me. Maybe you should try that thinking out
---
You sure you didn‚Äôt just have an extra full armor set from a quest reward?  The BOS reward is full ultracite and tends to glitch on occasion giving you two full sets   
---
Yes I‚Äôm annoyed with all the alcohol quests. Some more variety in dailies would add more daily replay-ability. And seriously congrats on beating your addiction, I know how hard it can be. 
---
But trying to make this a social issue just to make your point is not the way to go. Exploiting the social issue to get people to agree with you isn‚Äôt really helping the game at all.
---
 In fact if some stupid internet ‚Äúnews‚Äù outlet picks this up and writes some clickbaity shit article about it and then a bunch of self righteous non-gamers see it and get up in arms it could have a very negative affect on FO76 as a whole. And that‚Äôs not something anyone wants. Sure it‚Äôs a stretch, but hopefully people realize that‚Äôs the world we live in now. 
---
Thanks for your input mister neghative karma. 
---
Sheesh. You're like a dog with a bone. You're making an argument that people with vision issues shouldn't be allowed to ask for reasonable accommodations, getting downvoted, but you refuse to let go. 
---
Seriously. Go find a new issue. Nobody here likes you or agrees with you. 
---
Uninstalls your game and downloads Skyrim. 
---
I‚Äôm lvl 48 and only ever picked up one set of t-60 now I have two. I tried dropping it but it fucked my inventory and now I have six I can‚Äôt drop.
---
creeper explosions ptsd
---
For Violet Flux, nuke the Wavy Willard Park so that the nuke zone barely touches Clarcksburg and Kiddie Corner Cabins, approximately like this:
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/pchvb1p](https://imgur.com/a/pchvb1p) 
---
With Green Thumb perk, you can collect up to 240 raw violet flux. Note however, that there are very few enemies in that area so you won't likely get enough High Radiation Fluids, Glowing masses and Hardened masses. I wasted half my flux yield because by the time I launched on a dense populated area, the fluxes spoiled. I suggest nuking Whitesprings first, collect up to 25 of the components, then nuke for violet. 
---
I'm telling you, if 76 is a simulation, Bethesda needs to like tie it in Fallout 5, like "waking up" from the 76 simulation is the beginning of Fallout 5 or something.
---
Yeah, a modded rifle shouldn‚Äôt weigh more than a minigun.
---
Which Red Rocket?
---
It‚Äôs part of the veil of mystery quest line
---
Your cousin doesn't prove anything.
---
Sure. But the first question a judge will ask when a case is brought is "What has been done to make them aware of the issue."
---
 This thread actually got a response from Bethesda, so let's see what happens. 
---
How about...no. I have every right to be as much as you do, and don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre more important because you‚Äôre a handicap
---
&gt;Never mind I just switched servers and I only have one extra set that I can drop now
---
That has been known to happen.  Bugged items appearing in your inventory that don‚Äôt really exist.  Seems more of a visual glitch than anything.  Quitting and rejoining a server usually makes them disappear. 
---
Nurgle and the Death Guard approve of this message. 
---
BTW I drank heavily through several very painful bouts of pancreatitis, one attack that was causing me to bleed internally.  I'm not saying alcoholism isn't deadly, I'm saying it's not a disease one cannot cure oneself of.
---
I mean I pissed like 18 people off lol
---
No really, \_thank you\_! I grinded out a few more levels to finish ranking up Class Freak and Starched Genes, and now I'm hopping around like an idiot and smashing things to pieces in mid-air. You've made the game so much more fun for me! :)
---
I love all this. With a few modifications this is how Fallout survival should be. Surviving in the nuclear Wasteland.
---
Hmm, let me think. Tell you what - 85 caps and two tin cans, plus the 10mm bullets?
---
That's good for you, because I would imagine that explaining online how to use a newly discovered duping glitch might be enough to get you banned. 
---
I do it for my workshops mainly, but I do it for my C.A.M.P. because my memory is just bad enough if I stop for one I'll forget to for the other. I have a routine that helps keep me on track, and that's part of it, silly as it sounds. 
---
Couple that with the fact nearly every time I've met another player they're only interested in murdering me to death, no real incentive for me to want to make their life easier. 
---
He's still there need him for completing killing types of creatures the other day.
---
And within the limitations of the ‚Äòspecial‚Äô numbers you decide you can change perk cards to try out different builds.
---
I have 1h, 2h, Rifle/Sneak, shotgun/knife and unarmed builds that fit the ‚Äòspecial‚Äô numbers I decided on.
---
I had this happen the other day at the battle bot event. Another player got to the cabinet before me, and I watched him take everything. Was a little surprised
---
‚ÄúRelatively Innocent‚Äù
---
I'd say an aae 50 cal. Then you get the anti armor perks but also the explosive perks. The two shot effect in a TSE weapon is pretty much nullified now after the nerf.
---
Did u ever play Diablo 3 when they threw rgn out the window? It was freaking amazing and hella fun. So many things to loot and do. This game is too much of a grind as is.
---
Two to three could make sense, but one per region is a bit much. Whitespring can be a deathtrap for low level players. Currently the most used regions are the forest, the savage divide and the cranberry bog, so something like flatwoods/whitespring/watoga could work.
---
Separate containers? Absolutely, 100%
---
I played hundreds of hours of Fallout 4 and it's news to me that there was a cover system. I just fired it up to try it and yeah it's pretty nice.
---
No radio, sorry, too many EMPs from all the nukes. You're on your own, kids.
---
NO
---
For. Real. I remember when I first looted the plans off a Super Mutant near Grafton; so much joy!!! Ran home to craft them. Came back. Threw one. Itty bitty poof. :/ Regular Nuka Grenades are pretty dope tho! :D
---
I don't know if this is the issue but I found that when I put some of my moonshine and different alcohols in my stash they ended up going into the alcohol fermenter in my camp.  Its weird
---
Just switch Server and it's Not cleared anymore 
---
This is needed ASAP. Maybe something like x/y Missions have been completed. And once you complete all of them then it says Cleared 
---
The turret budget is absurd as it is regardless
---
Isn't this problem solved now that we have a separate pvp server?
---
Oh. I've never heard or done that quest line. I guess I'll have to find out how to start it. Yay content üòÇ
---
This
---
So many events are also too low level. There is no point in me doing an event anywhere other than the east side of the map.
---
You do realize they test that sort of thing before making official additions to the game, correct?  They probably will not add things that would affect server stability.
---
Most of the assets in Fallout 76 are from Fallout 4 so how would that affect server stability.
---
How is my suggestion unrealistic?  My suggestion is just as valid as anyone else‚Äôs suggestions for the game.  If they cannot give us access to every asset, they could at least give us access to more reasonable assets.  Maybe having a tugboat home in the middle of the woods is less likely in comparison to a small trailer or a scrappy homestead surrounded by tall junk walls with a massive windmill.
---
And they advertised the game goal as ‚Äúrebuilding America,‚Äù what is your point?
---
The whole point is for them to improve upon the game and more stuff for us to enjoy.  If they just want to keep everything as is, why should I continue to play?
---
I think it could work. Artillery and the Fermenting Station are like this already-- they have their own separate view of your stash, but the items are still stored in your main stash. It appears as though you have items actually stored in the Fermenter, but if you check your stash they're there.
---
It still may add some overhead, but I wouldn't think it would be as much as tracking actually separate storage.
---
not sure but keep searching around in the robco factory
---
no fucking way when was this announced?
---
I have been saying this a lot too. I suspect this will start happening, possibly with Wastelanders. I am hoping each year has a new season. At the start of the new season and a large world changing DLC.
---
The mirv is broken in 76. 
---
The MIRV mods just caused them to explode right upfront of you. It's garbage 
---
That's what I've read.
---
I'm still curious if the 6 nukes are considered independent hits and if they would count towards the furious modifier.
---
Sounds like a YOU problem not every one is a alcoholic if this silly game triggers you to go drink to death you need to go back to those classes daily and maybe stop playing or at the very least stop doing those Challenges 
---
Look I'm not shitting on you, but why shid they change something like that because it might offended someone. I like animals, should they remove killing wildlife then? I mean be let be realistic. I'm glad you made a post to talk about your challenges with alchoholism, it's a serious issue. But I'm not sure this subreddit is the place for it. Wish you luck in your recovery.
---
You really hate when people enjoy things you dislike don't you. 
---
One of my favorite things to do is spy on people from afar through binoculars. I have Chameleon armor so they never know I'm there. LOL
---
I mean, dupers can go to hell for what I care, it's when you punish legit players that bought those items (Whatever they were actually duped or not, I didn't even have a clue duping was a clue when I bought those weapons) that things start to get messy.
---
And it's not the fact that the duped items save the game, it's just the fact that without weapons with those legendary effects the game just becomes excedingly grindy in my opinion (Unless you use stealth builds or sneak snipers, but I personally don't like those builds at all).
---
That would be perfect!
---
Also,  great point about getting the other materials first.
---
Who said I dislike it?
---
Creatures burrowing to the third floor of my CAMP is bullshit.  
---
Or to fix the issues it has?
---
Thanks for all those who visited the trading post yesterday. It's really nice to see. 
---
No one wants to use the battle arena yet though :( 
---
Guaranteed legendary loot is a bit to much don‚Äôt want the game that easy but reducing the cost to travel to them is a good idea 
---
Reading comprehension helps
---
That's what I keep reading. It's making me not want to invest the time into hunting down the mod.
---
Assuming the mod were fixed in a patch........
---
Would the 6 rounds from the MIRV count as 6 shots causing the Furious effect to stack?
---
They even said that they didnt set it to new characters only so they could see how it would play out with endgame players rather than having to wait 3 months to see it get fucked up
---
Ok, so try some..
---
They probably won't allow more special points but that's kinda the point of certain legendarys and equipment. Like the backpack they will add in will supposedly have +75 carry weight with a moded max of 150. Sets on armor like reduced Aid actually make it more effective then perk cards as one set of armor like that is worth 6 cards.
---
I did. Your post is filled with insults towards those who play it 
---
probably however you wouldn't be around to enjoy it as it always kills you when you fire it. I tried it last night as the mod was at Harper ferry and I have a 3* fat man. 
---
Flamer scythe combo
---
Locations never clear in FO76. As soon as a new player enters the area, all enemies respawn.
---
In the words of my friend, an avid dark souls player: Git Gud 
---
A good thing we all play fallout for "realism" 
---
Not at all. You certainly have the right to be here. And we all have handicaps. Yours just appears to be lack of empathy and an inability to relate to people constructively. I totally get that and I wish you the best as you try to figure out how to deal with that. 
---
Yeah I'm expecting that it's going to look more like fallout 3.
---
This duoing glitch has been present for ages. I encountered this way back in December when I git my first PA.
---
Yep, it sure is... :-)
---
Radio distress signal come and go.  You'll see a Sons of Dane distress signal whenever Violent Night is up.  There are others for other events.
---
Again,  who said I dislike it? But then I guess you can read what you want in to it, if it hits a nerve.
---
It‚Äôs in the road map.
---

---
They should release a special event with super rare drops that don't actually drop :P
---
This is interesting, I've also gotten EggHead a couple times in a row on my "mules" when power leveling them, I'll recreate the Starvation and see if with some Rad Exposure if that is not what I get
---
I see what you did there.
---
I just hate the fucking annoying ass ‚ÄúWhrreeeaahggggg!‚Äù That molerats let out when popping up, every time I hear it I want to just point my TSE at my feet and fire.
---
I found the problem. It turned it into mountain honey. 
---
It would be something only each individual person can see so they know they've been there and done that before. Just like Fallout 4.
---
Thank you. I tried that and it worked. 
---
I mostly agree with you other than several 3 and 5 level perks are really needed just to get through a session without your equipment breaking after fighting one thing, etc.
---
My post wasn't about eliminating consequences of choice but about making choices more meaningful and not pigeonholing people in their choices so much.
---
Things like lockpicking in a multiplayer game should imo be more about letting your lockpick team mate open a door than making people fumble around swapping out a damage perk. 
---
As long as you have some content available that is only good for people who are fully combat optimized in one way, a lot of people are going to have choices eliminated from them too.
---
I've played end game in many games.  I get how all that works and why you can't just bring whatever but a game like this needs to handle that with care because without unique character choices, it looses the charm that makes it a fallout game or cousin of one even 
---
Calm down 
---
Sorry i find talking to people difficult 
---
Probably a Bethesda dev in test mode.
---
If you look in your stash and inspect your items you can see all the stats, this is the only work around atm.
---
Not an issue for me maybe your update went wrong? Maybe try a verify the games download
---
No doubt, but what I personally find weird about that location (given it seems like they should be coming out of Arktos Labs based on terminal details) is if they are just there to remain active and to reduce "spawning" processing time... why ***there*** of all places??
---
There are plenty of locations around the map that could work out better and not be so blatantly obvious. Or for that matter, considering Vertibirds (from FO4) can land, why not apply that part of the script to their behavior and just have them land in a clearing over there?
---
*Conspiracies aside...* I am not one to ignore the obvious detail that Bethesda sometimes do things that defy what we as players would see as being conventional-logic lol *(No offense, Bethesda, but it's an unavoidable fact :P)*
---
Whether it was done out of laziness *(* or because the original person forgot the bots were assigned there, and they've had more important things to focus on rather than picking a new location... that may never be known. It also wouldn't be surprising to hear that they don't play-test the game in a general sense like we do (i.e. mindless wandering), and simply don't notice stuff, only making a point to test aspects they've specifically changed to make sure it functions.   
---
Take for example how after v1.1.0.8 the "Inspect" option in vendor trades *(is it* ***all*** *trade windows?)* had vanished and still isn't restored in this recent patch. That was literally the first thing I noticed within 5 mins of logging in!   
---
*(To be fair I generally log out near a Vendor, usually Watoga, and so I quickly check for any legendaries to buy after joining.)*
---
They may also work in an editor which only *Simulates* playing on a server and as such, certain things like AI scripting may not be active, thereby making the Cargo Bot congregation not possible. They may just activate the script to test the calling feature of the quest, note that it behaves normally (and doesn't cause a floating drop-chest lol), then once it finishes it may despawn for them, freeze in mid-air to signify end-of-line, or fly away and then is "out of sight, out of mind" when it enters idle mode.  
---
\*epic shrugging\* heh
---
Seriously though. This is a reasonable request. Stop belittling everyone here who has vision issues. 
---
Your thing here online seems to be that you like to troll people. 
---
Singling out people with disabilities and saying they shouldn't be allowed to play the game is just annoying and makes you look foolish. 
---
Better yet, just tie a ripper perpendicular to a stick, but instead of a hold to damage like the buzz blade have it do massive bleeding damage
---
Triple shot explosive weapons that drop MIRVs around you when you shoot.  Create 5 star Legendary drills or legendary gamma guns that irradiate the user.  
---
It really is. I would be wasting ammo if I didn't have all rifleman perk cards maxed out.
---
Nice!
---
But it would be wrong information, then. I could clear, say, Arktos, but if I go back after a few minutes it could be full of Scorched again.
---
i have mountain honey moonshine recipe how much ?
---
Does this really surprise people, about survival mode. I mean everyone knew it was going to end up like this. In about a month it will probably be 99 percent sentinal, cavalier players against each other
---
Legendary items should disappear from the game
---
Been awhile since I played. In the southwest region is all I remember. It's the one that consistently has mole men spawn there along with a random set of power armor. 
---
You have to be trolling, there is no way someone can be that entitled. Like the other person said, go play farmville or candy crush.
---
Don‚Äôt think anything has changed, the only mats that benefit from weight loss are still alu and lead. But very happy to be proved wrong on this one!
---
While i agree as a short term solution these things are good, but 50 always felt so small
---
So it works for FO4 but not this? Cleared doesn't have to mean "never go back". Anybody with half a brain cell knows the places respawn but this would help us know where we have and haven't been before. 
---
Hot take: you should be able to trade perk cards with others (level restrictions still apply of course).
---
I know people have been discussing the immunity but I rather have re-spawn points and have a circle that you can re-spawn within that exact location.
---
I love it!
---
I've read a few say that it works if you fire it from VATS, which with my 50% VATS criticals would be how I would anyways.
---
I'm going to hunt down the mod today. I may need 2 so I can make a non Furious model to test against.....and maybe someone with lots of mats who is willing to let me flatten their camp a few times.... LOL.
---
Just lead and aluminium still. Why I find it so annoying that everyone wants everything bulked. It's just a waste of plastic people!!!
---
I too may be sick of drinking challenges.  I know it's difficult to think about what you've done but seriously.  You cannot let a game trigger you.  Life is full of stresses and triggers. If you cannot play a game because it might cause a relapse, don't.  What you are doing now is starting to take this game down a road towards censorship.  Ir's just as easy for another person to come along and say I injected things forever. Get rid of chems, it makes me want to shoot heroin"  Then somebody else has an issue with another thing.
---
Nothing about these challenges is glorifying drinking.  Running around a virtual world drinking imaginary alcohol that also has negative side effects can't be the root of the issue if a game can being tou that close to the edge.
---
Hell I want them to put hallucinagens and more drugs/chems/alcohol in this game straight up, cause it's fun yo!
---
I don't mean to be insensitive.  I have to call out requests for what amount to inviting censorship into a world I believe needs less.  I hope, if this game puts you that close to the edge in real life, you can find out why so you can better cope with these potential triggers. 
---
And add on TSE with ‚Äòarea of effect‚Äô and you remove the requirement for any skill during a fight, then add on marsupial and jump and shoot üôÑ
---
In Fallout 4 the respawn happened after a set time but here respawns depend on other players, so it's not the same. The map showing cleared would be meaningless, as it would actually not be cleared.
---
People will truly never ever be satisfied.....
---
What's the significance of the cargo bot?
---
Fill demo expert only seemed to give me like 25 damage 
---
Why? Because I don't roleplay that I'm getting drunk/high in a fucking game like a loser? wow.
---
Yeah but the crabs you get from the bags is a real drag.
---
400 caps?
---
I believe.  The primary reason being that it allows Bethesda to make new content without breaking canon. 
---
It wouldn't show cleared for everybody in a server, just for those who have cleared it once. There's literally no downside to it. 
---
*sigh* missing the point completely.
---
I think bringing the FO4 paint and allowing use basic colors would be wonderful.
---
Wow, there should be a prize for this photo. 
---
Unless you want to sell it to vendors of course.
---
An armchair expert! You must know everything with 100% accuracy, huh? thank you for gracing us with your all knowing presence. 
---
I used to regularly make wine using blackberries, as down here in Texas they could be considered a weed! Maybe one day they‚Äôll give us more wine recipes, because all you need is a high sugar fruit to make it. 
---
Good lord this has to be the worst post about the drinking challenges yet. I guess you get PTSD when watching literally any movie with drinking in it, or playing any video games with alcohol.
---
Jesus fucking christ, grow up
---
Ha ha. The bridge and the road have different centers. I centered it to the bridge so as not to disrupt foot traffic. 
---
Just so ya know....idk about pc, but on xbox, you have to get the kill shot for it to count. So even if u get in a few shots and share the loot....it wont count for the challenge unless you get the fatality. 
---
......imo, the reward also sux. But i did it for the challenge , so i understand wanting to complete it
---
Survival Beta is Beta for a reason. Its hot trash. It needs to be reworked. 
---
If survival characters can‚Äôt gl back to adventure then there is no point in survival imo
---
Oh yeah ofcorse for vendor sales, but everyone only wants to buy scrap of you if it's bulked. 
---
Dross toss triggers for me every day when my vendor loop takes me to lewisburg train
---
interesting
---
Except that it would be false information. I "clear" Blackwater. Map shows [cleared] for me. I go back 10 minutes later and find it's full if Moleminers again because someone just passed by. I come back to the subreddit and say I am done with this broken game.
---
Is that how you want it to work? Because as far as I understand, that's pretty useless.
---
kitchens tend to have a bunch in my experience (alum cans/cake pans) 
---
robot heavy events is another good spot to get them (awol/fertile soil)
---
 you could always take sunshine meadows or charleston landfill and throw down an extractor as a slow but steady optuon
---
I get your point but after two ingame weeks places lost their cleared Status in Fallout 4, so in Fallout 76 it Would be much Quicker 
---
I agree with the last two the most. Having them endlessly chase you down, then pop out of your fucking camp roof and attack you, before dying in one shot.
---
With all due respect- this is assuming you're not being a trolling asshat- don't play any Fallout game if violence triggers you. Look up what games have as content before buying so you know what you're getting into, so that you don't trigger yourself and have a bad day.
---
However, if you're a trolling asshat, you're a giant cunt and I say fuck you. PTSD is a real thing that people go through, so fuck you for making a joke of it.
---
Even little kids get bored with new toys after a few weeks of constantly playing with only that new toy.
---
I have like 8 or 9 extra ones you can have for free. GT: CharG31912
---
Yeah, I would be all for making it more complex
---
Forgot that only fanbois left in this Reddit, sorry.
---
And as some one who could not justify 20 bux for one paint job I‚Äôd love to see the blackbird back :P (now that I have the atoms). But at the same time I can understand why you feel that way. I admit it is nice having something that not everyone could get. Now I wouldn‚Äôt get mad at Bethesda for putting a limited item back that I had but I would have to admit part of me would be a little sad. Even though I know it‚Äôs kinda petty to want other people not to have it (which is why I would temper my disappointment and try not to rage against bethesda for doing it).  
---
Okay, how about "cleared once, spawning soon" since you need things to be literal. You know areas respawn, so what's the issue with people being aware they've already cleared an area once? 
---
The cleared isn't for anybody else. If I clear a location someone else isn't going to see it's been cleared. 
---
Whats your gaming time like?
---
*mods? I'm sorry, what? How though?*
---
Idk ask Todd.
---
I'm not really sure I understand. I have an apartment sized CAMP with benches, furniture, decorations, and four turrets, with zero budget remaining. I can't add even a single spotlight without sacrificing a lot of structure or decor, and the four turrets are barely able to cover the whole building, but might help if they targeted anything that was further away.
---
I think the total number of turrets can be limited, but each one uses too much budget as is, so we can't easily have a complete creative CAMP and also effective defenses.
---
Your previous comment is suggesting that anyone who does not find in-game drugs or alcohol cringe worthy is an incel. Not sure if you understand the word your using but it has pretty negative connotations.
---
And you didn't say anything about role-playing, you straight up said that drugs or alcohol in-game is cringe worthy to you and pretty much everyone else. I'm assuming this is your first foray into the Fallout franchise.
---
You think you can attack a portion of this player base with your sweeping generalization and you're not going to get some flak back at you? Wow.
---
Hydroponics!
---
I think it‚Äôs in the future because of all the closed off rooms at Whitesprings. 
---
Point is, it's a troll post making fun of the similar post "If you're going to role play as a raider then wear raider armor" that got to the "hott" section with a ton of upvotes.   So you're responding to a troll post expecting a civil conversation from the OP  lol
---
There can be too many events at once. I see 5 events going and 24 players on the map; the turn might not be good. And you may fast travel to an event with 30 second left. 
---
Many of us only care about the blackbird paint because it came out so quickly that we hadn't earned enough free atoms to get it.  Here's hoping.
---
There he go
---
That's like saying "measles is not a disease; I know, because I once had measles, and now I don't." It's kind of a dumb statement.
---
Turrets use up a disproportionate amount of budget each, making it *increase* because I need lighting is absurd.  It should be decreased overall, and then decreased by lighting budget again.
---
"This gun bash we added is so cool! Why isn't anyone using our cool bayonets?"  
---
"Unno, maybe because in real life nobody with a gun is going to run up to their opponent and bash them with it?"  
---
"You're right. We have to force them to do it."  
---
"That's not what-"  
---
"Make some of the enemies disappear if they're not right next to the player, and reappear right next to them wherever they are. Let's use the one that travels in swarms, and the one gigantic poisonous one."
---
I saw one leaning against a wall in a house the other day and tried to pick it up.  Can't remember where.
---
I hate interacting with other players, but I like seeing what they are up to.
---
What can I say? 
---
My point is that the "spawning soon" part happens differently from Fallout 4. The cleared label could change seconds after you leave the place, making the entire mechanic meaningless and useless. 
---
So the fasnacht parade again? 
---
If you can make it to the Top on the World ski resort there are lots of Ski Poles scattered around, these scrap to aluminum. 
---
And apparently is a rifle... wtf?
---
Non alcoholic here too... but it feel weird there's like pallets and pallets full of cigars, lighters all around, alcoholic challenges, so many drugs you can't even count them all, withdrawals, exploding humans and shit.... and yet you cant smoke a cigar much less a joint in this game.
---
So. Go all the way Bethesda, let us smoke cigars and weed too. And ease up on the liquor challenges or make them more creative at least. Or ban alcohol and drugs like you ban cigars (make them present but unusable)
---
Already have the paint. And not worth 1000 caps to miss out on effectively a neat little hidden quest. 
---
Correct, it is a troll.   However, there is some way someone can be that entitled:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7jzl1/dear_bethesda_a_word_on_your_daily_challenges/
---
People don't like the alcohol daily quests, so they will upvote any bullshit reason to get rid of them, and pull the SJW card.  I post this in satire/irony to point out such hypocricy.  ;)
---
Well atleast know i know that you are a complete dick. Spawncamping a Level 9 for caps, go search someone at your Level, but please when you die dont come here and cry about it.
---
Actually i am doing Rose's quests right now, so you are just in time. Thanks
---
Anti armor expl is better for enemies with high Dr, tse is better for lower Dr but high health
---
While I think that's a solid plan, I have a sneaking suspicion that most people are going to say "That's what your CAMP or Adventure Mode is for." :\\
---
When they introduce ‚Äúseasons‚Äù I‚Äôll give it a shot.  Mandating a fresh character is the only way I‚Äôll try it.   
---
I got it way back at the beginning, off a corpse near Charleston fire dept I think 
---
Survival is more of a fun thing I think, all I see is people complaining about how you can transfer characters back and forth, so I feel like this is an adequate solution. Not to mention you can transfer a char. that you made specifically for survival during the beta like I did.
---
Lol well I'm not 100% a shitposter but it is my primary way of pointing out things I think are retarded :P  In this case, it's this post that got to the front page of this sub.

---
Yeah I know it kind of sucks, any places you recommend to farm legendaries?
---
How much damage does explosive add? 
---
Fyi the camp fusion generator does not produce fusion cores . Only the core generators at workshops (power plants) can do that.
---
Haha well thx
---
You could have just killed him once then left him alone but you continued to wait at his camp to keep killing him for a small number of caps. You're more than entitled to do this, and maybe he could have done more to avoid this, but it still sucks. Don't come crying to us for validation next time. 
---
Yeah, Hopewell's Cave can get really intense. I'll definitely have to use this trick now.
---
I've noticed my hunting rifle and 10mm seem to do the same but my shot gun and 44 seem like pea shooters
---
swtor 
---
The SB outside the cavern kept landing in it and scorched kept attacking and I just wasn‚Äôt super prepared. Too bad I dropped some items by accident before the blackout happened.
---
im on ps4. My psn is tukkunnizura
---
Just make sure you have some disease cure handy.
---
I haven‚Äôt had an issue with it either, and I‚Äôm Xbox. That being said I don‚Äôt usually claim workshops since they have exploits around them and open up to unwanted PVP. 
---
That said most that PVP me for the shop usually are interested in the shop and only the shop, and PvP me out of necessity (and maybe some fun, but they don‚Äôt bother me afterwards) 
---
Yes.
---
How do you barb it
---
Yeah, what happened with the Blackbird paint was pretty unfair. I don't personally have much desire for it, but I'm staying hopeful that it returns for the sake of everyone else... and if they'd bring that back, maybe they'd bring back some of the less-popular things too!
---
Oh that was a long time ago lol, thanks for the tip
---
Pick up all the cafeteria trays as well. Make sure to mark aluminum  in your component view for easy detection.
---
It should be the other way around. Survival characters can go into adventure but adventure can‚Äôt come back in to survival. Otherwise all those cool weapons would be stuck in survival mode.
---
I think my character has gotten alcohol addiction 2 or 3 times from these challenges, thankfully I've had addictol handy, but yeah it doesn't set a good precedent.
---
I thought also calling things "junkies tire iron" etc. was a bit much. These themes can be fun and add to the game but at the same time, seems like it was written by or for people who have never seen what's happening in the communities around them and wrist it's like for people.
---
Having chems etc as an optional path is always a fallout feature, and having characters that say unkind things etc..great. But the game itself should be a little more human maybe. 
---
I agree , with the one shooting, lame üòí.
---
But go with low level character or with no caps and no aid.
---
I‚Äôm level 190 plus so great target since I‚Äôm not pvp geared rather have all my armor for weapon weight reduction ...
---
Damn I haven‚Äôt ran into that problem yet.

Lol it is in reference to this post.  People will upvote any bullshit reason to get rid of something they dont like.  I hate when people pull the victim card.  I know my post is to get downvoted because removing violence from fallout because of my IRL issues is ridiculous,  by contrast, people don't want to bother doing these daily quests because they are tedious, so they will upvote this guys IRL issues to get rid of them.  Sheep.
---
ok sounds good GT tanaas
---
Loved your satiric take on the "If you role play as a..." post too. Keep up the good work, friend. 
---
I am just going to downvote you and hope everyone else does the same. We don't need you in this sub.

Takes 2 minutes and 5-7 seconds for the blackout to happen.

---
Perfect. The poles are all around the area, even down by the train station at the raider camp. There will be some sort of mobs there to fight, but once you‚Äôve cleaned them out look for poles there. 
---
There‚Äôs also a bench to scrap the poles in a little room to the right of the resort lodge, on the left before you go through the flame traps. You can also scrap (and collect more poles!) on the second floor of Rose‚Äôs building. 
---
I was so bummed when I found out I can‚Äôt grow pumpkins.
---
I‚Äôm confused, that‚Äôs a thing? Sorry, I just got back into the game last week since late December because of a problem I had with DirectX and the Oct 2018 Win 10 update fixing it. 
---
Counterpoint. The writer of the letter had gone insane and helped the Secretary pressure into a first strike against China, causing the War. 
---
Awesome. Joining now
---
Xbox 1
---
Level means nothing past 50. 
---
Also i think it's perfectly fine for a low level to be more or less on the same power level as someone much higher level. It's more balanced this way. 
---
I‚Äôm on all day
---
Do you take salt sir. I can one pop 300+ characters with headshots, doesn't have to be critical to. I'm only 113... Some players don't wear armor, some people's armor is defenseless against some people's build... I'm assuming your Pve and tried survival out..? Some people have been Pvping since forever and mastered it.
---
People got pissed off with Pvp players so Bethesda gave them somewhere to go, the mechanics are far from perfect but at least it's a start. Stop crying, your probably just shit at the game lol. 
---
Yeah that was a rare one.... :(
---
How about for better clarity than 'cleared' as an area can't truly be cleared in FO76, the term 'explored' to show you that you have previously explored an area. This seems to be what OP wants from the suggestion. 
---
Yeah I think it‚Äôs a bit classless they did this.
---
I would **not** pass through that tunnel, so unnerving ...
---
So much for automation is the future of jobs. Horrendous robots can't even get our sales correct.
---
They could charge you if you fast traveled to the event then immediately leave 
---
what is your gt?
---
Maybe that'll be nuclear winter
---
I know you think I'm a fucking asshole, but that was pretty funny.
---
Last night I played with randoms as my norm , and towards the end of my game play we did sons of Dane and another group of 2 players joined us , peaceful trying to get that legendary so we started to be careful with our shooting, event was done and we scrambled just for safety.
---
Then again last event for me of night my group is being careful with not one shooting other then NPCs , one random player decides to Join and started shooting at my group, we killed once , he came back to the event again waving trying this happen 3 times , we only shot him because he clearly wanted to disrupt , he never spawned again.
---
Some of unspoken parley for events might occur but use common sense if you sense danger ...
---
RUUUUNNN 
---
Lol you two are missing the point and it‚Äôs sad they don‚Äôt see it. 
---
I think every single patch someone posts this sort of "This fixed EVERYTHING!" and even stuff like a poorly received survival mode has to have that so people have to twist it into it fixing adventure mode 
---
make them similar to the silo pieces, where seconds after you receive one, you got a message saying it will self-destruct
---
&gt;mod it to our liking
---
How do you mod to your liking without crafting a ton of them and scrapping to learn ? Things like lever and handmade.
---
I see them all under doors.  
---
Check the left/right options for each entry. 
---
Also make sure you are not set to ‚Äúbuild able only‚Äù filter. 
---
Well, an area is "explored" when it's icon appears and becomes blue on your map, so, that already happens? Now, you could say that someone may discover a building but not go in and that shows uo as blue too. That's something that could be looked at.
---
Ahh great, thank you. I‚Äôve either not seen that perk card or overlooked it.
---
How do you take pictures on PS4? 
---
You don't need grapes to make wine, just fruit.
---
Everyone who plays survival is a fucking maniac.
---
I love it.
---
Yeah, I wish the default stock counted towards auto pistols i'd be more interested in it because the rifle category has enough in my opinion.
---
Lol that‚Äôs not even the same, the correct comparison is going to restaurant and having to drink a bunch of alcohol to get free currency to use in the restaurant and there‚Äôs no other way of getting it. 
---
You should be respeccing your char until you determine your preferred playstyle. Only then starting over is worth it.
---
That‚Äôs great!  A home for everyone
---
x Makra x. I'm below you trying a skyrim on this shit haha
---
THIS!
---
My dad was an alcoholic and I attended AA meetings with him for the first 10 years of his sobriety.  As a result of hearing all of the stories and life experiences shared at those meetings, I do not drink.
---
I'm fine with the general workshop theme as well, but I was dismayed and a bit turned off by the constant drinking/brewing challenges.  So much so that I haven't even played the game in the past week or so.
---
This is called cavalier armor
---
Midwest as well and I think there might be some sort of widespread internet thing at play. Internet has been funky all morning. And no, it isn't on my end.
---
I was on last night, and saw the same 10 or so people I usually see.  I don't like to fight, but I do like to play hide and seek, so I bring all my holotapes with me to listen while in my little hidey hole.
---
It's the same few, server hopping to farm caps at Whitesprings station.  I wish more people would get creative with it.
---
It doesn't seem like a BETA, all your progress carries over, they don't roll back any lost caps or items you gain or lose, you get it in the 60 dollar version of the game on the main menu without downloading or opting in to any sort of beta program. Seems pretty damn launched to me. Seems like they just slapped the word BETA on to trick dummies to excusing it's poor design.  
---
It's the combination of anti-armor and explosive that does the best damage. Explosive alone really isn't that great post Nerf
---
Gotcha
---
Use the share button to take screenshots.  Works on every game that I am aware of.  Except during certain locked scenes due to copyright stuff. 
---
You have a really good point.
---
My man!
---
Level 30 with duped gear &gt; Level 120 legit player
---
Bethesda doesn't seem to care that trading for black market duped gear is a pay to win mechanism.
---
Not sure if these may have any bearing on the matter but if you can answer them it may at least rule some things out and let people offer suggestions...
---
Do you have an Ultra-widescreen monitor? *(like 21:9 ratio)*  
---
Do you play in Windowed mode? *(I doubt there's any functional different if it's Borderless or not)*  
---
Since you say "still crashing", since how long has this been happening? The last couple patches? Since launch?  
---
What graphics card do you have?
---
Personally I can't recall this exact thing causing a crash or error-less CTD (crash-to-desktop), as usually for me both kinds of crash types manifest in either: a completely random way at an equally random time, OR, is preceeded by the "freeze-wait...-unfreeze-play...-freeze-wait....-wait....-wait.......-wait.........." situation where it just never unfreezes after that lol Not *exactly* a crash but still requires relaunching the game :( (Though usually it does unfreeze eventually, then my client realizes I've timed out and disconnects me... which again, equally as annoying since I've lost my server and/or ability to loot, considering this usually occurs during a SBQ fight)
---
I think they are trying to get people use more alcohol and that way more alcohol perks
---
&gt; Your previous comment is suggesting that anyone who does not find in-game drugs or alcohol cringe worthy is an incel.
---
You read that 100% backwards. Those items in a videogame are cringe inducing for normies. My accusation was that only incels and tweens find them to be exhilarating for their roleplay. It was definitely hyperbole.
---
Surface to Air is decent but SBs are easy for me. Yummy meat.
---
Fly Swatter: one stealth shot from a Dragon and you're done.
---
I'll take that quad or double crossbow if you're selling it. What's your price?
---
If they just made it so perks like hacker and lockpick where passive then we would have enough perks. Make non combat perks passive and then we would  have enough perks. Really how do I one second know how to hack and then the next I'm grumpy old man yelling at computers I don't understand. 
---
Tonight **on adventure** I claimed a workshop on my lvl 8 alt with my gf, hoping for some plans. Waiting around for the defence event then along came a couple of 100/200 leveled with bounties and shot up the place, nothing even build just a stash and a chem bench. I respawned hoping for peace and to complete the event just starting, staying outside the circle not caring to contest but they killed me again. So I fast travelled to my gf's camp across the map, but shortly after they both rocked up and completely obliterated the camp with explosive guns. Wooden shack, farm with a cow, couple turrets to keep the scorched at bay. Ruthless demolition.
---
Girlfriend was so pissed she logged off.
---
i wouldnt consider myself blinded by bethesda and accepting of everything, or fanboy, or whatever the cool word of the day is since ive only played 2 games from them 4 and 76. 
---
that being said i believe i have gotten way more than my monies worth, i bought the tricentennial and i am currently well over 900 hours of play time.  
---
i have 3 characters currently 232 sniper, 99 unarmed/ 1handed melee, 17 pistol. yeah the first days of beta and the couple weeks after release were rough, but the current state is far far from unplayable.  
---
i dont have end game OP pvp gear, never even tried looking for it although i do have personal found 3 star useful weight reduction armor on 2 of my three characters as well as decent weapons that let me kill quickly. my main i traded/bought most of her rifles, the melee used weapons i found on the main,  whos main weapon of enjoyment is actually 3 star rolling pins.. would love to have that  "Bloodied Explosive Vampire's Two Shot Anti Armor Rolling Pin" to make granny the goddess of the beatdowns.
---
im coming up on 50 years myself, and i say this not wanting to belittle your statements or feelings, but if you think this/these issues are just a bethesda thing, i really hate to burst your bubble, but every single game out there has bugs, glitches, exploits, and have screwed things up after patches. I could go on for days about the dumb shit Blizzards done.. how servers dropped before you could pick up your loot (seriously search memes on it) thats been going on since D2, or how we spent YEARS begging for a patch to fix known issues, and duping (i played d2 8 years, d3 3 years/still play it from time to time).. not 3-4 weeks but YEARS dude.. final fantasy 11 full on AAA game company and omg the glitches there, bugs, clipping issues, break one thing to fix another, nerf something instead of buffing it (played ff11 for 12 years). dont get me started on the dumpster fire 14 was that almost shutdown SE as a company and ended with a whole game team fired and a new team brought in. 
---
i am what 5 months into this game with 900+ hours, and from what ive experienced so far has been awesome, the community involvement, their community managers coming into these reddits and interacting with the players, taking our complaints back to the team, i mean look at pvp, they created a whole NEW side of the game because of their customers complaints and completely basically divided the player base in a couple months because "we" asked, AND still put out their new content.  
---
are there still bugs? yes, are there still server disconnects? yes, are there still exploits? yes..  
---
tell me any other game out there that does NOT have any of those issues ever. ive played halo and had em. ive played cod and ran into em, every game i have ever played outside of the atari and nintendo, super nintendo have had these same issues when dealing with anything online and if you say no, then sir i would ask you to remove the blinders you are telling the rest of us to remove. every friday night at game night at a friend of mines house, i watch his wife get pissed off at the new call of duty game because she gets kicked from servers and lobbys due to issues in the game.  
---
now as far as the refund comment im sorry but most AAA titles give you what 15 to 30 hours of a story line, and then you are left with is small map pvp scenarios.. 15-30 hours..   
---
most games that are online mmo's charge a monthly fee.. ff11, ff14, wow to name a few with updates requiring you to buy dlc..  
---
fallout 76/ bethesda has given us roughly 40/50 hours of story lines, free dlc, and no monthly fees. and you and those like you scream "i wants da refunds cause game sucks" after ya spent 100+ hours in the game.. i can only ask people with similar opinions to just wake the hell up you have gotten alot more for alot less from bethesda than anyone else.. hell i paid 80$ for battlefront, played the storyline in 10 hours and was done with it and havent played it since. for what 8$ an hour enjoyment.. ive played fallout 76 for over 900 hours, for 80$ roughly $0.088 cents an hour of enjoyment.  
---
im not saying your complaints about bugs, disconnects and such arent valid, but there is no game out there thats online that doesnt suffer the same from time to time.
---
it is not appearing :( my dart board isnt either like all stomic things arent showing
---
You can get a lot of violet and crimson flux when someone launches on cranberry bog too, which happens more frequently than the top corner. Wait until the soarched earth event is done and head over. Look for the areas with trees grouped together and in the trenches/ waterway areas. Since one of the recent updates, the flux tends to really stand out now. 
---
Again, you'll want to be sure you have enough of the other materials first cause not many enemies drop them there. 
---
Im sure you know em all....west tech - but thats a kill zone in survival. Uranium fever, if u can get there without to many other people joining. Any events that want u to kill a hoard of creatures.   If no evens are running then robco and the place across from it are good to check, the the red rocket north of there, then harpers ferry. All those in a loop, cause theyre all good spots. Good luck!
---
Keep ur head down, lol
---
Pacifist mode is backwards. They have a bounty ? You cant fight back and you're screwed.
---
PA here, was just on for half an hour, no issues. 
---
yeah same
---
Gauss Rifle - High damage/shot, slow reload, slow fire rate.
---
Lever Action - 5 more damage than the hunting rifle, no magazine (no perforating mods either so keep that in mind; and yes, perforating magazine matters quite a bit) decently fast fire rate.
---
Handmade - Faster reload, kinda like a combat rifle. 
---
Lever and hunting rifles are still the best if you want high damage/shot. How to find them? well, that's the tricky part. It's pretty pointless to invest in a non-legendary variant of either of those so you best bet is to farm some legendary mobs and hope that lady luck is on your side. That or just buy it from someone.
---
3* anti armour power fist. 40% increase to power attacks, attacks ignore 50% of enemy's armour, and and extra perk that benefits it forgot what it was. 800 caps. if you want it at double durability 1600 caps. Psn noscope_420bird 
---
They did say at PAX east that letting people use their maxed out characters was a good way to see what breaks fastest.
---
Seasons should fix this,  it will be like diablo 3,  new characters,  new special challenges.
---
Yeah im sooo over the boozy challenges 
---
I‚Äôll do 1600 caps for it
---
Ironic that pre-survival mode lots of my fellow PVE-ers on here complaining about unwanted pvp activities.  Post-survival mode, still lots of my fellow PVE-ers that decided to try out pvp on here complaining about imbalance in the game mode that was not designed for us.
---
Ok so you are both who they designed this mode for sure....still means you are kind of dickish. 
---
Alright I'll be on in an hour 
---
Are you on the PC?  People using mods or a custom ini file have been known to have issues with Atom Shop items. 
---
Virtually every PvP oriented player I met has already got one if not few different sets. One good drop, month of trading and you are fully decked out. I myself gathered around three sets and gave away like a 7 pieces from that to help build a better PvP team. Yesterday I bought a AAE hunting rifle for 2000 caps from someone who clearly disrespected its value and sold it for BE handmade and unyielding aprefresh sentinel piece. Net gain of two godrolls for 2k in a day. Ye that was a lucky shot but you don't get lucky shots if you dont search for them.
---
Same here, I have so much food i cant even give it away. Half of it is pretty good stuff too.  Still lasts quiet a while with the perks.
---
epic!!!
---
Alright. Thank you
---
Change the intro video to the Skyrim intro.
---
You‚Äôre welcome, have fun. 
---
Yes I found mine in the first few weeks after launch at the shops across from Charleston hospital.
---
just get a five cap bounty and go ham
---
That one has been in the game since release
---
No, they really cannot do this. Everytime another player fast travels to a location enemies respawn. It'd say [cleared] for like 30-60 seconds max. Shit by the time I finish the path I take for my whitesprings loop the clubhouse has respawned ghouls when I get back to it.
---
I get what you want. You want to avoid replaying an area you've already cleared however there is a ton of new stuff to be found on each playthrough not to mention XP junk and legendary farming.
---
Even if you add a status bar say total missions completed against missions availible it'd be lame. I don't want to know this info it will discourage exploration.
---
I don't speak for everyone but I certainly think this would be a waste of time and we don't need it.
---
For violet flux, Harper's ferry, prime fissure site, and toxic vally by the water park and hemlock holes. The problem then becomes getting enough of the other stuff to craft it. I would say Harper's ferry is the best to get everything u need( lots of enemies). For crimson flux if you get the farm to the west of Harper's there is a crap ton of wild corn.
---
What level is the power fist? 50?
---
I really love Mr. Tweed's mustache.
---
Your DR/ER/RAD values probably should include ones for each level of the armors. 
---
assistant manager
---
Tesla bracers does not exist for ultracite or excavator 
---
Yea its lv50 or 45 can exactly remember but it's got a godly roll to it 
---
Yea I can see that haha. Just send me a message when you are ready, I‚Äôll be farming for a bit.
---
Sneak. It was a bitch of a time at a low. Level. 
---
They make 100 power. They do not need or produce fusion cores. 
---
It‚Äôs just a power generator.  That is all.  Creates 100 power for your camp to use. 
---
No no guys, things have changed a lot recently.
---
Steel now is no-longer pointless, resulting in massive weight savings! Aluminum and Lead I **think** have had their bulk-weights increased just a tiny-tiny bit, so aren't *as good* as a few patches ago, but still important to convert.
---
At, or over, three patches ago had most of the bulk stuff result in slightly ***more*** overall weight compared to non-bulk. I'm pretty sure it was changed at the time of the Stash increase to 800, as a way to further maximize our space, since as we know it was useless before. I've not done the actual calculations since then, having just assumed (maybe my mistake lol) that they've properly gone over them all and adjusted them so that they now in bulk are at *least* the same weight as the comparative loose components. 
---
**TL;DR-** Steel and Lead in Bulk are the two biggest weight-savers with the current choices (at least as of v1.1.0.8 aka Patch 7).
---
This mask has been in game from the beginning. I got one in one up at the train yard north of Whitesprings.
---
You‚Äôre right. I will definitely add it on a separate post or updated version of this one. I tried to keep it concise here just to be able to give an overall idea about different sets
---
It's effectively *Blitz* so the devs intentionally left it out for players.  They must not have realized it's just as bad for creatures to have Blitz too, especially this poorly implemented.
---
Why would you fast travel if you know this? 
---
I go there for the xp boost on my alt... all I see are the same names ganking each other over and over.. same 'ol same 'ol from any online game that has pvp in it... I just do my thing and avoid the dramatics. 
---
On the off chance that I get sniped or whatever... I respawn at my camp and start over. 
---
Whatever... thanks for the leveling boost!

Good read Baron, doing Appalachia a nice favor for us Power armor users!
---
Thanks
---
Those are old leftover dupes. Guys duped literally hundreds of those back before the first duping patch. Lightweight high value plans
---
If you knew anything about Alcoholics Anonymous and the whole "disease model of alcoholism", they say that 1) it's a disease that can't be cured and 2) you can never drink again.
---
Maybe people and methods of curing alcoholism show this not to be true.  Some cannot ever drink again, but that doesn't make it a disease; that makes it a behavioral issue.
---
I will try that thank you
---
Connect a wire to the pointy connector on the top of it to power your camp items just as you would with the other power generators
---
That‚Äôs awfully judgmental. Some people are jerks and enjoy griefing, some people like me enjoy survival and pvp because the fight is more interesting, dynamic and dangerous than a programmed beast that acts the same way every time. Too much negativity everywhere these days 
---
Cobalt can be found along the road between Whitespring and the Station.  Glowing resin in the trees and slit beams mostly.  
---
I believe a Morgantown Nuke has a lot more with slit beans and corn.  
---
They are used mostly in some under armor mods.  And serums.  
---
Yes, they should stick to promoting killing, a much more palatable pastime. 
---
Another one with no reading comprehension.
---
The chances of duped gear at lvl 30 is low as mostly high lvl stud as duped
---
Make it so that if you die in survival your game gets minimized and if you have skyrim installed it will launch it.
---
Whitesprings is the one of the best places to farm legendaries and grind levels. A lot of folks would be pissed if we couldn't nuke there. 
---
I watched a video on it and they told me it was something like a 1 in 10000 chance to drop and I never noticed it
---
I'm selling 1 of each. Just throw me a number and I'll see if it works. Btw you have to reload each bolt by pressing x multiple times. But it fires every quick.
---
No, it's not just the in game notifications. If I am done with a ws, I also no longer want the risks of owning one. You can just ignore the defend quests, but that still leaves you open to pvp. The problem being that without the option to "disown" once you take any ws you are permanently open to pvp for the rest of that session unless you hop server.  Server hoping should be discouraged imho, it shouldn't be treated like a feature. 
---
I bought a 3* level 10 TSE pipe bolt action at a vendor bot.
---
Maybe someone actually had that drop for them and decided to sell it to a vendor bot for 59 caps. I'd be more inclined to believe that it is a dupe.
---
This is sooo helpful, thank you so much! I hadn't even considered some of the combos you mentioned. I've been using T-60, but I think it's time to change it up and use T-51b. 
---
Go to Welch, always mole miners and tons of BT
---
Edit: it could be possible to pick it up as it's fly toward you, I really don't know how I got it. 
---
Except who says you are in a early version of the simulation? With no memory or sense of time (check your PIPboy), for all we know it could be version 8000.2 of the original simulation. Constantly updating, tweaking and reseting while in the 'real world' hundreds of  years could pass...
---
That‚Äôs great info, I‚Äôll try that.
---
It‚Äôs somehow tied to server stability. Or at least it was. 
---
Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of melee weapons
---
You ear pieces of shit for breakfast? üòâ
---
It's not a drop though, it's a bug. Not sure what video told you that nonsense but it's apparently pretty common now as I googled it to get back to the post I linked above and noticed a lot of similar posts asking what the hell the thing is. It's essentially a worthless dud that's probably going to be patched in the future.
---
Which loot? Some loot is instanced, some is just always there..
---
Thanks for the heads up, I‚Äôll update it on the next version. 
---
Thanks!  I‚Äôve been struggling to find a good spot on my own.
---
Interesting
---
Just imagine the .50 for the sniper rifle is .50 Beowulf. That would gel out a little better.
---
Can‚Äôt really do much about your base but lock your water purifiers I think it‚Äôs one of the bumpers in workshop mode when hovering over them. 
---
Yep, hope that helped!
---
Fully agree. They have had posts acknowledging the situation but never saying what they plan to do about it.
---
Or the mine near Whitesprings 
---
I always dropped my dupes at the end for other players to pick up. I ended up with all the common masks, beret and both recipes this way.
---
That‚Äôs what the Pulowski Preservation Chambers are for.
---
Are you speaking of the quad?
---
That is regrettably still part of the game.  It sucks worse I suppose when you‚Äôre being targeted.
---
Aha! This was their plan to save the game all along!!
---
So you shit where you eat instead?
---
Either way, doesn't make you look good so eh ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I can craft a set on ps4
---
Ty.  This is the only comment needed.
---
Its a set spawn for that mask, its always there, nothing special about that mask.
---
Hmmm, fair point. I just want my character I made during the beta to be accessible during the full release, as I am pretty much strictly playing survival with it.
---
My rebuttal: The Pole Hook. Similarly, useless when you think of it. 
---
Glorious guide, I love the look of T-45, one of the main reasons I fell in love with Power Armor was because of Fallout 3, there was nothing better for me than seeing a whole unit of Brotherhood soldiers rocking the T-45 armor alongside Liberty Prime, heading over to the Jefferson Memorial for a militarized push against the Enclave! You did not fail  to impress me Lord, keep up the good work member!
---
Great work!
---
wat
---
This is hilarious since you have Raiders flair. A Raider with no real killer instinct or knowledge of not blindly inviting PvP to your teammate‚Äôs camp.  
---
I hate greifers and occasionally I have dealt them justice when I run into them. But here You are the one solely responsible for not understanding that workshop is auto PvP for your whole team and that you never flee to your camp during PvP. You should have left the server the very second the workshop was contested if you didn‚Äôt want PvP
---
Put them in stash, take them back out. Fixed it for me. 
---
Sneak + Silenced Hunting Rifle for moving around. Shotgun + Enforcer for if you get spotted and the Wendigo. 
---
Thank you. Good luck to you as well
---
I saw the skin on a Bethesda weekly post a while back and I told myself that I would login everyday and save up my atoms just for that. I did it and got it as soon as it released. It's basically skulltrooper from fortnite. Plus it was out for 2 days. This is just my opinion and I obviously wouldn't care if a dress or whatever came back to the store 
---
My tag is Lawhorn 
---
Good point, but it doesn‚Äôt fully deny or confirm the theory
---
I'm going to now!
---
if you‚Äôre going for power armor, dont take adamantium skeleton in endurance because in power armor you dont take any limb damage even without any perks. those points you can save for something else
---
I'm already using stabilized, and the GG is hitting pretty well for being a Lv40, but is a bit difficult to land a hit when all you can see is a blurry mess of White-Green hell of screams.
---
Gauss for damage, lever for damage per second. With max rifle perks my non-legendary gauss does 224 damage. Holding the trigger charging up does even more. With sneak attack 2x and a head shot I can one shot lvl 68 super mutants. That‚Äôs with a self crafted vanilla gauss, no vats, critical etc. 
---
My self crafted lever action does 130 damage. I use it on larger numbers of lower lvl enemies like lvl 42 ghouls because it cycles faster has a larger magazine and reloads faster. 
---
Legendaries are great but you definitely don‚Äôt need one to play the game.
---
Make it triggered by respawn instead. 
---
Same, I have a 51 arm
---
I don't lock mine because it's just water. Plus if it's locked you are more likely to have your base destroyed. In my experiences at least.
---
Torso: Core Assembly
---
Legs: Kinetic Servos
---
These two + an AP build makes it so you'll never really run out of AP. Which also means that you won't suffer as much from being overloaded. Yes you can't sprint or fast travel but you can still run, and most of the time when you're farming for stuff you'll just run. The AP regen is fast enough so you can easily fight while over-encumbered. 
---
Makes it better than the Calibrated shocks; especially if you're one of those persons that will loot everything that's not bolted into the ground(and yeah it sounds counter-intuitive). 
---
The carry weight will never be enough for me so i simply stopped trying to manage it. AP legs makes the experience really enjoyable.
---
And i really wouldn't slap calibrated shocks on everything... They're literally the most overrated PA mod in-game...
---
&gt;Although VATS is not recommended with Power Armors
---
I strongly disagree, vats can work really well with PA. You can even take the rare sneak shot if needed and when you get in trouble you still have quite a lot of armor. The fusion core consumption gets much much better with just 1 rank in power user. 
---
Been using PA VATS+all AP mods for about 100 levels. 
---
Also a vats build will benefit a lot more from kinetic servos than from Calibrated Shocks or Optimized Servos
---
Same way you got your base up there...
---
sorry have to downvote any of this sort of nonsense.
---
I didn't see it until it was posted in game and I had only played fallout on and off then so didn't have near the atoms and it would have costed 20 bux to buy the difference. If it had just been five bux I would have even paid to get it.
---
I would imagine the holiday-themed events will return with the holiday. I don‚Äôt know about the more generic items, though.
---
Low-level high tier gear sells for a LOT of caps on market. I've sold level 25 stuff for twice max level
---
I'm starting to hoard screws
---
Yes. To both. 
---
"We totes did this for April Fools...definitely a feature, not a bug"
---
At the gorge junkyard, there is a black titanium deposit and you can put an extractor on it and collect a ton in a couple hours. There is also a ton of mole miners up at the ski resort by top of the world!
---
I've seen a lot more people picking it up recently. 
---
perhaps it should be an ultracite flare, emits the aroma of fresh ultracite luring them to land, may not work on the scorchbeast queen
---
Survival mode I just recently learned is not all about pvp, i topped the leaderboards for 3 hours just farming exp, and events. 
---
i really wanted to read this -.- why delete bro?
---
Some items can come back but most takes 20 hours to respawn. Server hopping only helps for items like plans that were on that server but taken some time earlier. Switching servers might find one that is not taken yet.
---
That‚Äôs a very good build suggestion, I think people would benefit from it. 
---
You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúnot recommended‚Äù but fusion core usage can become overwhelming when you quickly use vats hits.  
---
I've been doing a lot of Survival and I'll be honest it's nice to pop back into Adventure, sit on the bench outside of Vault 76 and look at the clouds for awhile.
---
I love the idea that you drank a vintage nukashine, killed a deathclaw while drunk af, blacked out, and somehow made your way out of the cave, probably after killing both scorchbeasts while blackout drunk
---
they dont take the stairs though... they come bursting through the floor likie a bunch of damned heathens
---
So help me out, since I‚Äôm not understanding 
---
Your process is to obtain and secure a WS to get mats, e.g, lead or FC.
---
you‚Äôre saying once you‚Äôve obtained the needed mats, you want to abandon the WS,  
---
Without have to server hop
---
And with out penalty of pvp?
---
You realize this last patch removed slap damage if you‚Äôre pacifists?
---
slap damage has been reduced to 0 damage.
---
You can only pvp if you Engage in response to a griefer taunts?
---
Meaning the ONLY WAY a griefer can grief you if abandon a WS is to return slap damage.
---
Just like in real life, it takes 2 ppl to fight. 
---
Fwiw, I‚Äôve had folks try and contest my owned WS, blocking his GT and server hop was my standard practice.
---
Now, it‚Äôs just BLOCK.. lolz
---
If it‚Äôs a ws I‚Äôm still farming, the most dmg he can do is WS resources, and the turrets treat him the same as ghouls.
---
If you accidentally take something out of the desks besides the technical data, it will make the technical data not spawn for a day or two. I‚Äôve done this before.
---
At that point, it doesn't really matter if the game is a sim or not. It's essentially impossible that it's a sim if we're assuming we're in the same timeframe, but if we're throwing time out the window, then sure, it could be. 
---
This said, I really don't think this is the angle Bethesda is going for given the sole points of evidence are insane ramblings, and a precedent of significantly less advanced virtual reality that was used in a few select cases.
---
There isn‚Äôt a pumpkin shortage 
---
Yea, a real life scythe doesn't make a good weapon at all. The blade is at a 45¬∞ angle so that it's even with the ground when you're swinging the handle in an arc in front of you, and the handle is usually either bent or has an awkwardly long secondary handle on it so you can more easily swing it around your body. The blade is also very thin and more like a razor than like a sword.
---
No i mean 20kills reward = 2deaths punishment.
---
I am loosing to much, which is not fair, when i have nothing better than level 50
---
Until we randomly play on the same server and one of us will be forced to move. Or war
---
I found a skeleton holding one the other day, in an unmarked cabin.
---
Good looking out üëç I'll probably just end up giving my dupes to my friends and randoms
---
Bump. 
---
I use a T51, Grinding for the improved shocks for my excav PA.
---
Not at all, 99.9% of my hits are Vats hits. 
---
Here's my gameplay (while overloaded ofc) to get an ideea on how intensively i use vats https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2PQrqbthn4
---
I only need to take over a power plant once every 2-3 weeks. 
---
Both the double and quad. You have to reload each bolt until you have it filled. You don't have to fill it up to use it though, it just holds 4 that can be rapid fired for quick sneak damage. 
---
I have both the T60 and T51 with the excavator PA. I‚Äôll switch between 51 or the 60 based on location and use the excav for carry 
---
It currently is levelled out
---
For 1, another option is to extend fast travel invincibility and not able to deal damage to another player in that time
---
The time I had heard this, I was not yet a member of the enclave, and I was walking down a road in the savage divide.
---
that only explains SOME of the voices in my head, not these particular ones....
---
Was just about to say, this could be a limited time weapon they could throw in in October
---
As an FYI there are a fair amount in the bottom right corner of the map, and a few east of watoga, south of the antique shop.
---
a random encounter with the voice of someone telling you to leave it alone? Did you have the voice as well?
---
I wish that‚Äôs 100% of what survival mode was. I had some fun honest pvp with a couple of guys one time in random weird locations scattered around the forest. 
---
Ha, nah I don't think you're an asshole.  Just don't agree that our IRL problems should change the game for other people.  :P   
---
That said, I hate the alcohol daily quests (well there are just too many, a few would be fine) so I do hope they tone them down eventually lol
---
I'm going to downvote you because you're a salty asshole who clearly doesn't know how this game works?. That level 30? Sounds like a dude to me. You asshat üñïüñï
---
"I got killed by someone lower level that me, this game is broken"....., Whatever
---
Enjoy it while you can. You just know once they start doing something with that vault the area will be a "no-camp" zone
---
Raider flair cos it looks cool and my other character is a RP Raider, nothing to do with PVP. Raider always in Fallout, but they've never had PVP. I'm one of those classic fallout players who has played every single game happily with NPCs and dived at the chance to play with my friends in the amazing story-driving survival and decision-making game that Fallout was, not the holotape snore-fest bethesda barfed out with this game. Forced PVP is ridiculous when pacifist mode only means you cant fight back and become helpless. Rude to be forced out of a seemingly PVE aspect of a game designed around "rebuilding the wasteland together" but really means stab each other in the back because we say so. I'd love it if workshops were like communal camps everyone can join in on, not just hotspots for griefers to hunt sub-level 10s.
---
It's almost like they haven't been paying attention to the gaming world and tried a 10yo mechanic that doesn't work thinking it would magically work for them. Are we sure this is their B team and not their F team at this point?
---
Where‚Äôd you get that power armor paint?
---
They can burrow through solid concrete and steel, its not a terribly big leap to believe they could superman jump from the ground and up through the floor :/
---
Cool looking camp. I really like the simple, themed designs like this. 
---
Nothing in fallout compares to the horrors of a creeper behind you.
---
You‚Äôre still saying the same thing. ‚ÄúMature normies‚Äù find in-game drugs and alcohol cringeworthy. Therefore if you don‚Äôt find it cringeworthy you are not mature, or normal. That is a personal attack against many who play fallout.
---
You do agree you are accusing people that role play as a drug user or alcoholic in-game of being societal outcasts, or immature. So I‚Äôm really missing to see how I read your comment 100% backwards. 
---
You obviously have a problem with in-game drug or alcohol use, or at least the people who partake of it in game. So that is why I suggest you go play a game that is more delicate to your sensibilities. 
---
&gt;In about a month it will probably be 99 percent sentinel, cavalier players against each other
---
I'm going to laugh my ass off when those builds get nerfed.   Trust me it's going to happen. 
---
Bethesda introduced these armors   into the game world with the assumption that people would be able to acquire 1 piece if they were lucky,  2 pieces if they were ridiculously lucky. 
---
I seriously doubt Bethesda ever intended for people to be running around with entire sets of this stuff. 
---
I'm having the same issue, something has definitely changed since the Survival update...
---
Tech Data
---
You need to lock your water purifiers. 
---
I was playing last week and found a guy who was living right by my camp in my Brothers spot, me and my brother went to visit him as we live in an area that not many people usually live in. We went in his house and were greeting him but he got annoyed after a while because we were sleeping in his bed and messing around in his house. 
---
After a while he attacked my brother (who is level 17) and so we started taunting him. I guess he didn‚Äôt like visitors because he got mad and went and destroyed my mothman billboards. I didn‚Äôt want to engage PvP so I instead bombed his base with my artillery and hid in my armoury lol. 
---
I got a pretty high bounty but it was worth it lol. 
---
that could all be easily explained, the simulation is taking place post war, we are still in a vault, and the people running the vault have access to the surface
---
You can legit make wine from blackberries and sugar.  Yeasts coat almost all things.  It would be gross but you don‚Äôt need anything else to make wine.  
---
That's great, never thought it could be this effective, wow. Do you use just 1 card of power user? any other fusion core duration perks? what is your perception and agility btw?
---
I think that I've still got a while, Vault DLC isn't coming out till Summer isn't it?
---
Sir, this is Vault-Tec Law Agency, Vault-Tec wants you to vacate the premises or face being sued in court. (It looks cool, btw)
---
If there are higher level players around, higher level monsters will spawn in. Try to go there when nobody else is around.
---
By far the most ridiculous sight / sound effect is a mole rat popping up in shallow water. Sounds like a freakin naval battle is taking place. 
---
Im saving all my duplicates for when player vending machines become a thing. I'll sell them for absurdely high prices. CAPITALISM!
---
I'm on I may need mats to get the double durability tho
---
Not the point,  I want to grow them.
---
If you're on PC, hit me up (Lionneserra), I'm swimming in Black Titanium and would be happy to trade or sell some!
---
U say this now but if they actually did this and u died unfair u would rage and say ‚Äú why would they let us lose all our items when there are so many unfair weapons. ‚Äú 
---
Also making everyone start from scratch would just delay the same bull shit that happens now like legendary Gatling guns and stuff murdering u hella fast. Also no one wants to start from scratch cause the game is super boring story wise and your just fro ding to get to where u were before
---
Trigger as soon as ‚Äúwell rested‚Äù pops up.
---
‚ÄúAh,  you‚Äôre awake!‚Äù
---
You need specific fruits as some fruit does not have enough sugar or would be too acidic to ferment into wine.  Blackberries can be made into wine on their own but you would have a hell of a time making passionfruit into wine without adding water to cut the acid. 
---
So lots of flux but did the super mutants drop high rad fluids, glowing masses etc.?
---
I found a base with turrets around the whitesprings spawn. Absolute asshats.
---
I feel being on the top of the leaderboard for survival gives you a sense of dread and awareness that any vault dweller could potentially hunt you down. It allows for interesting fear based decision making. Or you just survive and keep getting that xp. Whichever happens is fine by me. 
---
I‚Äôm cool with booze quests and challenges, just not 3/5 of my dailies. It‚Äôs like they just gave up.
---
Even better. Take my up vote. 
---
Couldn't a critical hit targeting their wings already do this?
---
I actually think Scorchbeasts are fine the way they are, even before the nerf.  My problem has been more about the attack being visually overwhelming, especially whenever you do Surface to Air.  They could stand to make the projectiles a bit more translucent.
---
Shit I would grind it out if it meant I would get the jester and skull mask
---
Here are additional places to farm the data:  sugar grove. Orange and blue circular file cabinets. Once you go down the stairs, take the hallway on the right. Two cabinets behind the locked door. Four further down the hall on the next door on the left that spawns a gutsy. One or two on the last door down the hall on your left. 
---
Once you go through the double doors. Again turn right follow it up to the office there are another three. Down in the control area with the assaultron turn left. Go in the meeting room there are three or four more. And in the control room proper there is the desk tied to the event that can also have one. Phew. 
---
Okay watoga high school, go in the double doors, you can check the three or four circle cabinets in the CS lab off the right across the lobby or turn left past the display cases Into the principles office. Four file cabinets in there. One in the next room and the wall safe that can spawn TD. Dont forget the cap stash under the desk if it's there. 
---
I dont know specific directions In robco or west tek but they do spawn there too. As for whitesprings, maybe anecdotal evidence but dont loot anything but the tech data. Even from the desk tops.  They will replenish and you'll get TD if theres at least a pencil in the desks. If you take anything itll reduce the containers with items in them by that count. Reducing your odds of TD spawning.
---
Enjoy the grind?
---
The Tyler county racetrack has a few aluminum deposits. You can take that one and put a few extractors down and take it in!
---
I've been trying to get a picture of a launch ever since I found the launch tube.  Very nice!!
---
I wasnt lucky enough to get those. I just have like 3 each of the "common" masks. But you just KNOW someone who didn't play the even will really want the masks and might be willing to play a few hundred caps for em.
---
Center a nuke drop just north of watagua station, crazy amount of violet around there
---
Technically that could be true, but literally nothing in the game hints at it. All of New Vegas could just be a simulation, all of Fallout as we know it could be a simulation. Ultimately, it doesn't matter if it technically could be a simulation, given the lack of real evidence. No one would make a game about a virtual reality simulator and then have that not relate to the central plot in the slightest.
---
Experience
---
I got murdered at level 6 by a group of 100+ people in power armor when I tried to claim a workshop. I had no idea at the time it enabled PVP. That was my first few hours of the game.
---
As someone else said, if you don't have the green thumb perk, invest in it. It doubles everything you pick. 
---
I did not realised that, makes lot of sense for a Beta indeed.
---
Lol.. what a dick question..
---
V.A.T.S.
---
The thing is, I wouldn't say that. If I didn't want to take the risk of getting killed by other players I wouldn't be on survival in the first place. I think a lot of people want to start from scratch, from what I've read. They could easily implement a system where the servers are populated with the players of a similar ranks  (+/- 10 levels). I just don't see any point to survival in its current state.

ack

Depends on the build. Rifles Bloodied/Anti Armor/Two Shot/Instigating with Explosive/Vats Crit is best for rifles. It depends on the way you build your character. Melee is very similar except two shot isnt an option and instead of explosive you would want faster seeing speed.

1. Agreed. There should be "safe zones" ... where you can go and do normal QoL activities without fear of being ganked. Train Stations or even whole towns should be safe zones. 
---
2. I disagree with this one. I think it should be more severe. I think when you die, you should drop everything. Including your armor and weapons. 
---
3. I disagree with this one as well. There are other ways of balancing the combat than character levels. Clever players will always find ways around game mechanics especially with pvp. And honestly, level doesn't mean much after 50... we all know this. Also.. with the implementation of safe zones, there will be less need for this. The map is huge... avoid high risk areas until you're ready for it. 
---
4. Agreed. This, and change the leader board to take into account someone's kill count. Higher kill counts cause you to be shown on the map... that way I can either avoid you.. or engage you. 
---
Sure, go ahead an downvote away, it ain't like your opinion of the matter actually affects me. So enjoy your downvote for being a typical keyboard warrior an enjoy your self indulgent and close minded views
---
Can you pick up more than one technical data at once?
---
I think that it's important to understand that nerfs are coming. Having seen the recent interview with the game's developers, it's very clear that they themselves don't realize how broken PVP is.  Up to now, there hasn't been much PVP.  So PVP itself is still in Beta. 
---
Yeesh. Who roped your blue balls into this?
---
Some did, it turned into an emergency post on here and on the Looking for Group. One nice guy answered with a good price, another screwed me.
---
Me too! üòÅüëç
---
I think it's just you
---
More constructive how? By feeding all my caps and aid to whatever asshat with more money than brains who used his wallet to buy an unfair advantage?
---
Same, got three of each of the commons and some duplicate decoration plans &amp; true, very true
---
Super low.
---
&gt; Don't want to be the "must be fun at partys guy" but a scythe is actually quite useless as a weapon
---
...this is the game where we have a rocket thruster on a sledgehammer
---
+1 strength is the two shot of melee. 
---
It doesn't help that for the toughest locks or hacks, you need to go through, remove three cards, and add three cards.  If they named them "Hacker 1, Hacker 2, Hacker 3," it would be simple, but "Hacker, Expert Hacker, Master Hacker" are scattered around.
---
Half the time, I just don't do high-level locks or hacks because I'm too lazy to switch cards and there's rarely anything worthwhile anyway (see also: I swear the Lv. 2 and Lv. 3 safes have their loot tables mixed up).
---
Nope, it's just people being afraid of the boogeyman or thinking anyone better or more knowledgeable must be a griefer. 
---
I know the feeling.
---
This and you wouldn‚Äôt have to eat up perk card space to reduce cap cost
---
So wouldn‚Äôt being done with it be when somebody tries to contest if for most people? This would just be a way of avoiding PvP.

I can‚Äôt it‚Äôs always just been one of that‚Äôs what you mean
---
Only 20% or something I believe
---
Go to a vendor and sell it, you‚Äôre legally entitled to 2,147,483,648 caps
---
How so? I‚Äôm always curious about these kind of things.
---
You literally posted that YOU BOUGHT AND HANDLED DUPED ITEMS KNOWINGLY! You literally said YOO DIDN‚ÄôT CARE!
---
On behalf of Bethesda:  you knowing broke the rules of the game and have therefore been banned until further notice. There are no appeals 
---
Done. 
---
Reading comprehension would have gotten you that info a lot sooner
---
Everyone gets the banned code on April 1st! 
---
I have a level 51 alt that I've been playing survival mode with. I've been killing level 200+ players all day. No duped gear. I shouldn't be able to do that?. You're the one being self indulgent if you think just being a higher level should help you. You can still max out damage perks early on. I don't see what your issue is??. This game will keep getting nerfed to hell because snowflakes like you can't handle getting killed?!. You are the one who needs to open your kind my friend.
---
anything above level 50 is just a larger number. everything else is just a personal skill. time playing the game. grinding for better gear. etc.
---
Yes, I am not sure if they fixed the problem yet because it was supposed to addressed. Anyways, people were building a CAMP of just turrets in line with the windows of the golf club to kill the spawns while they were away. It allowed them to loot the legendary spawns without having to be there. It ruined the area for anyone actually trying to play in the area.
---
It's negative caps though, so you'd have to pay the vendor to take it from you. 
---
Sometimes I'll do that and drop bags with protest signs at places I know they'll return to, then watch their reactions. 
---
Eyebots
---
I'm aware friend, I work in a winery.
---
That's a really good point. Low level players dont have access to power armor or shouldn't spend a lot on radiation chems just to make a beeline for the door. 
---
There's some north of WhiteSpring in the woods too. With green thumb I can usually grab enough for 2 stable flux. The foresty area around the Atlas observatory has some, not a ton, maybe enough for 4 stable. 
---
Colbalt is the only one I really struggle to find most of the time. 
---
So... a reverse robbery?
---
who tf said it couldn't/deosn't relate to the central plot?
---
Its pretty bad because the shield that your supposed to get when spawning does not work. You can get killed before the world even loads in.
---
I cant wait for the legendary vendor.. been hoarding 3 star weapons ... box is full and i havent sprinted in a month lol..
---
Nah. Ive got around 80 hours on PS4 and never had a griefer. Not 1
---
So for 2 you should have a level 200 one shot a random low level and drop most weapons and armor?
---
If it's the issue with aiming down the sights being much higher than the crosshairs, I've been having that occasionally myself while crouching, but for me it's fixed by standing up and aiming quick, before crouching again. After that it works fine. Doesn't happen too often thankfully, but it *does* indeed completely screw up being able to aim with sights.
---
I don't know how if it happens with scoped weapons though, as my primary weapon is a Lever Action Rifle with Reflex (Circle) and  I don't often use my Gauss with NV Scope. I've had it happen with iron-sights as well, but since that uses the same aiming mechanic (not a zoomed-in overlay) I'm not surprised it happened there. I'm suspect to think it only happens with Irons or Reflex sights and is caused by a glitch with registering you being crouched as the amount the aim is "off" is roughly that of the change from standing to crouching.
---
Exactly last time I iook down w/one blast as well.  Easiest event ever 
---
Any specific weapon in each type? Like groknak for 2h and combat knife for 1h and single shot rifles combat rifle? Etc.
---
I meant in the context of Fallout. Tarberries are more akin to cranberries than grapes. Mutfruit trees at least are more common and the fruit doesn't need water to grow in.
---
It can be brilliantly fun at times. Intense back and forth battles in cool terrain. I can also be getting shot in the head the second you spawn into a train station. It‚Äôs not perfect, but nothing is perfect 
---
&gt; Maybe you don't feel like killing a level 1 molerat
---
this is why i always have a melee weapon as my second weapon 
---
You can't even fit 100 people on a server. Wtf are you going on about
---
Bethesda: Yes that's totally April Fools haha fooled you guys heh heh (gulp).
---
Really? I guess they changed that then.
---
And I think my pet should be fine. Enemies only attack from one direction at my camp and I have a turret with spotlights watching over him. I just need him to go chase down the stuff hiding behind things.
---
I do that as well. I never attack, I just observe. Sometimes I give gifts or flee if i‚Äôm spotted.
---
No problem
---
Level 100. Sorry that was poorly worded.
---
This would be pretty great. I still don't have my own PA station, so fast traveling in, fixing my PA, then going outside for the nuke could be nice.
---
Distant thunder is a good one especially if you team up 
---
You always get some decent loot or plans or both 
---
True. It adds about 5% damage.
---
The idea was to shed light on the issue such that it gets fixed.
---
I don't do those atom challenges, I get a bunch of atoms by organic play, just doing what I do. I get to have more fun doing what I want, and they add up pretty good that way.  As far as the brewing station, a lot of those potions give good buffs. I know the word on screen say " various alcoholic beverage " but I tell myself potion. Potions are fine, been chugging them since I was 5 playing original zelda. Mix in a little imagination and make it what I want.
---
They actually call for blackberries in the recipe, which would be fine if that was the only ingredient, but for some reason the uncommon tarberry is included.
---
lol yeah it is definitely too many.  
---
I can craft those for you if you‚Äôre on PS4 
---
well i doubt he was really griefing you but used you to get a high bounty, its fastest way for players wanting to get pvp initiated is to destroy someones base for a big caps bounty, and being in adventure mode he has a better chance at a "fair" pvp here than in the survival spawn camp mode. i say this because he was one and done, not repeatedly harassing you over and over again.   
---
others have mentioned locking water purifiers, all it would have done in that situation is helped him up his bounty a bit since picking a lock gives like a 5 cap bounty.. so really locking a purifier against someone like that is pointless..  
---
personally on all my characters i leave all my purifiers unlocked, if someone comes by and wants water or food, get it its what its there for, of course i run 10 industrial purifiers on each character and atleast 70+ food plants, i want my characters fed and watered, my friends characters fed and watered, and any random that happens to find my camp.. i try to be the food bank of appalachia.
---
I imagine it more like how you pay to have your trash picked up. Only this is $2billion of trash. 
---
At the *very* least make it so they have to have a cooldown on how quickly they can burrow again and make it so there is a short amount of time where they can't deal damage after bursting up from the ground
---
Everyone does no damage towards other players
---
Only thing I would add is it's closer to lvl 60 just due to obtaining higher level perk cards at Max rank. Also we get I think 56 "special" points to assign cards to thanks to having one in each at lvl 1
---
So I need to find a scorched version at a random encounter to get a higher level one? Will any random encounter location do like the one above Abby's Bunker? 
---
Or apparel. I don't think guaranteed legendaries will even do it (AWOL Armaments sometimes has three 3*'d Gutsy's and I still do that event alone or with my buddy often. I've gotten a lot of really good stuff from that event.
---
Model is in the game.  I literally just tweeted Bethesda a picture of it asking why I can‚Äôt take and use it.
---
With the 4horseman skins coming I want it for the death armor.
---
This is a great idea. It gives new players a place to work toward, like New Vegas. Plus since it's pretty much the middle of the map that would be a valuable point to fast travel to in order to save caps. 
---
Also they should have it be so that the Whitesprings robots are the "refs" for PvP if they cant disable PvP. Just make it so if a player starts a fight inside the shops the robots will wipe the floor with any player regardless of level. Give the robot "essential" properties so that they are invincible. It adds a threat to the Robots who wonder around and would keep griefers at bay. 
---
By maybe trying to understand how pvp is actually works right now. I don't need a single legendary weapon to kill lvl 100s with my lvl 12 with a shitty shotgun. Pvp is is designed to provide parity among various lvled players and not to allow lvl 100 players to just stomp low lvl players all day. 
---
The paper damage of a weapon has no value in pvp. Guns are categorized and all guns in that category do roughly the same damage. Have a semi auto rifle and you kill in 2-3 hits against a full health player. 
---
Armor values don't really mean anything and most legendary effects don't mean anything in pvp. Perks and legendary effects that provide percentage based damage reduction are very useful and probably op. 
---
That all aside you can try not to call people who kill you a bunt of offensive names.
---
Working as intended
---
Shit! 
---
Let‚Äôs put a rocket thruster on the scythe.
---
Yeah I dont pvp either. But if powering up Poseidon, or an enclave event breifly flashed I'd probably join those. 
---
Could be a setting that was easily toggle-able if people wanted to opt out but I am always looking for events to do as I'm done everything else. And I'm tired of getting to then with 17 seconds left to go. 
---
If you only wanna kill, you go to survival. The worst of the worst are gone
---
My only thought as to why they are there is for getting to low level areas faster.
---
Don't teleport and you won't have issues.
---
This is why I really think there should be a hotkey to toggle pacifist mode on and off. Opening a menu, and then a submenu, where you can't see what is going on in the world while on that screen, is not at all smooth. You'd die before you got pacifist mode turned off and out of the menu screen in a lot of cases.
---
Missile silos have it too...filing cabinets 
---
The vendor can just quit their job, it‚Äôs the most money they‚Äôll ever make
---
I‚Äôve seen it for 25 to 100
---
I‚Äôve paid 100 for stable before 
---
I've got 400 hours on PS4 and have never been griefed.  I think the issue is cross-platform but for late adopters or people still below 60.
---
Well explain me a level 60 in power armor gets killed quikly by a level 112 without power armor
---
All I want is a bunker like the ones in the mire. #DreamCamp 
---
Not forced. You just don't understand game mechanics. Also slap damage is gone. So if you don't want pvp. Don't claim workshops and don't shoot other players. Simple right?
---
Sadly, this raids will be vault 94 and 96 and this is vault 51. So if you watched wild Appalachia teaser, this underground you saw can be vault 51. You know, they teased a underground zone and just added new vault to game.
---
I‚Äôve noticed containers being empty after looted for at least two days now, probably since u7.5.   Meds, ammo, desks you name it, something changed.
---
This a dev post haha
---
Yup
---
I buy lots for 35 a piece.
---
Just reporting that I am having the exact same issue with the KidSecureID.
---
Or hopped up on something JFC 
---
Yup...all of the above.  I was hiking yesterday and saw a fern....my first thought was Flash Fern! Violet flux!!
---
Fallout's improbability drive.
---
I have been finding it since the update other than yesterday.  As noted earlier don‚Äôt take anything but the tech data.  The container will not refill based on server hops‚Äîonly time.  
---
Deathclaw gauntlet for unarmed. Unarmed also benefits from twisted muscles and talons mutations
---
Ooh, hard pass
---
We have magical unexplained power armor that folds up and weighs only 10 pounds no matter how large, heavy, or  complicated it is unfolded.  
---
We have houses that can materialize out of thin air, based on pre-war tech that charges post war money? 
---
We can seemingly download the ability to make anything, like Keanu learning kung-fo
---
 We do the same things over and over again, during we possibly die multiple times and come back having learned from it, at the end we feel good about ourselves and then the situation resets and we can do it again from the beginning.  
---
Nice, never seen a Camp there.
---
They announced seasons. They need to fine tune the fuckery first.
---
depends on what your looking for, and also whats in the world you pop into and whats happening, there are a few factors that go into it.. if you are talking like recipes, plans, stealth boys and so on if you pick one up you wont see another one in that area yourself for 20 hours.. UNLESS, say you zone into the watoga medical center (stealth boy) as say someone is zoning out of it since the instance is now tied to both of you static loot from the first guy to enter would be there for you so if he had never touched the stealth boy, it could still be there for you to get, same reason why if he killed the boss/legendary it would be dead for you.  
---
slocum joes the coffee shop and the diner in watoga are good examples of this happenind since both have recipes, and slocums has magazine, you could grab all the recipes and the magazine jump to new server land being the first one in the area check and there would be nothing, but jump a second time, land as second person there and there would be new recipes and magazine since the guy there before you spawned em. but hadnt picked them up himself.
---
This.  üëç
---
Wow that's a great picture. I can never seem to get any good ones.
---
lol
---
That would be funny for sure, but sorry no
---
:-)
---
I did a short technical data farm yesterday. Most servers had at least one in WS. A few had 2-3 and only twice did I hit back to back empty desks. This was out of around 30 hops. 
---
Dang talking about jumping into the deep end of the pool to learn to swim!!!
---
How does one aquire Tech Data?
---
Me too. Although I actually like it better!
---
Had one burrow out of a car I was standing on. And in FO4  they would appear on the second floor.
---
don't spawn at stations, problem solved!
---
So...ive tried this twice now, just for something different. The first time i went in....saw some gouls, nuked the town, and its all mole miners.   The second time, just now. I server hop till i made sure it was alllll gouls, drop nuke....dead gouls, and scourched. What gives?
---
Do you have power armor? I just did it and went in there guns blazing and chucking grenades. I have the blocker perk too so the Wendigo barely scratched me in my armor. You could also try crippling the Wendigo with grenades or frag mines. Frag mines used to be my go strategy for Wendigo and Assaultrons. 
---
In Survival Mode.
---
the camo is on the gun's stock, the rest of it is just clean. unless the paint only works for the default stocks. then thats a bug
---
If you don't want PvP *at all*, stay away from Workshops. That's all you can do.
---
My perks: https://i.imgur.com/FtSH4yJ.jpg
---
I'm planning on giving up on all of my strength and get nerd rage or tenderizing. 
---
That set-up is extremely AP efficient, and yeah i know how painful it was to use vats with PA. 1 Rank in power user seems to have fixed that insane AP drain. 
---
So he used me and had to waste my resources on repairing my base
---
Agree , once level 50 is all about perks and gear 
---
The stock is black
---
I mean, I paid $35 and I think I'm closing in on 400 hours.  I'd say I got my money's worth.
---
Should the game have released in a better condition than it did?  Absolutely.  I don't think you'll find anyone blindly proclaiming that the game doesn't have issues.  But I end up treating it with a Kickstarter mentality.  I find that there's a certain charm to watching the development process at work and feeling like you have a small part in that.  The fact that every week, there's something new to screw around with is pleasant, and I'm convinced that by the time Wastelanders is done, we'll be able to take a step back and realize just how much the game has grown.
---
But some don't like that, or don't want to wait, and I can understand that.
---
Nothing screams "Apocalypse" more than male pattern baldness, IMO.
---
I did the same thing. A lot of players would drop stuff at the end and we‚Äôd all be checking bags to see if there was anything worth taking. 
---
I have a quad crossbow that can rapidly fire 4 bolts 
---
Scorchbeasts don‚Äôt need to be nerfed anymore. There not even a threat they just eat a bunch of your bullets. 
---
Noice!
---
It‚Äôs not a bug. It‚Äôs a feature to prevent people from farming silos to power level and get massive xp.
---
I would silver this if I had coins. 
---
I've actually loved both. Survival completely removes the impetus to try to abuse workshops, since you don't show up on the map. I've actually gone back to just building workshops up to the build limit and it has been a blast. I don't really mind the powergamers as they're usually not in the corners of the map without fast travel points (and by extension, victims) and I can usually hold my own with an unyielding/random sentinel and cavalier effects gear. At the end if the day, unless you hang around Watoga, Whitesprings, or the popular event locations you're usually fine.
---
Been playing about a week and already been greifed on pc :/
---
that sounds like a missing texture bug. 
---
It changes everything BUT the stock
---
If a random low level is outside of a safe zone or somewhere that is not safe.. there should be a need to think about the risks. 
---
I don't think anyone should even be interested in "one-shotting" anyone... but that's the nature of the beast in pvp. There will always be players that want to just plow through everything that comes in their path with no challenge. Now that I think about it, this isn't even limited to pvp.... but I don't think that Survival mode should be watered down just because people are getting ganked. That element will always be there. 
---
I spent a lot of time in Survival mode on my alt... went over there at level 8... I was killed twice. The rest of the time (about 8 hours of play time all together) I never saw anyone. I watched the same 5 -6 names scroll past me in the upper left corner of my screen .. they were killing each other over and over... typical pvp yank fest. No thanks. 
---
But will I go there if the stakes are high for some cool rewards? I sure will. I'm sure a lot of people would... but it does need some polishing for sure. 
---
*removes your Old Man Winter Mask*
---
‚ÄúGotcha, Todd!‚Äù
---
Did it, this challenge took me 20hours. You better avoid it. If not, have luck!
---
A rifle ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù to .50 cal rounds shouldn‚Äôt do LESS damage than one with a .308 receiver.   It should be putting softball sized exit wounds in things not tickling them.
---
realized I was in a friends camp so thats why 
---
I ran into some douche trying to fight me in a nuke zone yesterday and it was so pleasing to taunt him and laugh at him while he kept punching me. Now that they‚Äôre no damage if I don‚Äôt respond back to him hitting me I can just laugh at the assholes who try and grief
---
I actually understand all of the numbers, values, percentages an all that dumb shit behind pvp, but what good does any of that do, when ANYONE, regardless of lvl or gear can be killed instantly wothout qny form of actual combat.
---
What i really don't get, is why everyone is still calljng this shit pvp. It's not. It's whoever pulls the trigger first vs. Who is dead. That isnt pvp.
---
An if bein called a fucking twat offends you...well...if the shoe fits feel free to pace that shit ip an wear it. Otherwise, stop bwing so god damn weak willed that a word hurts your feels.
---
Regarding OPs Wolf, I agree it should be a legendary, with all events having more legendaries.
---
But, do you agree the intro Wolf Pack event should have a 3\* every time, as OP suggests? I gave a downvote because of this 3\* detail, other wise would agree.
---
Just had my first encounter in pvp yesterday after 100+ hours in adventure mode, two low rank players 15 and 4 tried to take over my workbench and for the first time I fought back, it was comedic they kept spawning over and over trying to dethrone my workshop, needless to say it didn‚Äôt work out for them haha, but it was entertaining! So I‚Äôve had great time on prior to adventure mode, so won‚Äôt bother me any, prob all those Xbox and PC players, PlayStation players are a friendlier bunch I suppose! Haha!
---
Upvote cos you are right, but also because Halifax :)
---
Maritimer 4 lyfe :P
---
yeah what others have said, mine by train station in watoga, ash heap, town below the train station there, the big mining thing on map has alot of mole miners too, lucky hole mine (near asylum) has alot of mole miners as well..   
---
i see someone on pc has offered to help you in your quest, and i can offer to help ya on ps4 if you are on that console. anyways yeah rule of thumb ya doing anything to power armor take ownership of it first by gettin in it.
---
Im console, griefing is rare for me also. Mostly people working together with thumbs up.
---
Now the only fear is for your camp I suppose
---
How is trading with other players a pay to win mechanism??. Player trading is a game MECHANIC and available to everyone.. you're on Reddit, you can buy from any of the trading pages here.. is it in the atom shop for real money?? No... 
---
I took one look at all the alcoholic challenges and just decided I wouldn't do them.
---
Most likely top 3 are crouching
---
Searched for "[Rocket Scythe](https://i.imgur.com/hnObWwW.png)" was not disappointed 
---
only the top 3 are shown on the map, and they can hide the marker just by sneaking. it only shows up if you‚Äôre standing or running so people sneak wherever they go to avoid being shown on the map
---
It took me 20hours. It is nightmare, you cant server hop on survival, events don't start often, only legendaries with star counts.......
---
The chassis is just to hold your gear that's it. It wouldn't be fair for you to have 6 pieces of gear with resistance while everyone else has 5 
---
Gotcha...just here to bitch, wine, and waste time. Understand.
---
Haha really? Was going to try it out today, is it that out of control? 
---
Don‚Äôt quote me on this but I think they effed up the rate of drops and being that they don‚Äôt have a shitstorm since the latest flop they had , they just stated it was working as intended , you really think 0.03 % is an actual odd for such magnitude of event , it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs a real life lottery 
---
Ants also spawn in the substation just slightly west of there, fighting a deathclaw. If the deathclaw has killed them already by the time you got there, you can still use the "butcher's bounty" perk to get some meat.
---
"the first car I ever learned to drive was a helicopter"
---
Gotcha.....your just here to bitch, wine, and waste time.
---
I broke into someone's very nice Camp just to check it out and left a Sweet Roll on their bed, totally worth becoming wanted
---
*before release.
---
I too love a good stalk. I like to use my Grognak ax and follow low levels dressed [like this](https://imgur.com/a/xRCzHMQ) partially hiding in bush or behind trees.
---
You've been lucky. I and my friends have been griefed hard core for days on end across servers even. It's just the luck of the draw (we're on PC)
---
Leather traveling coat is supposedly a drop from events like "Heart of the swamp" and "always vigilant"
---
Yea but what about those who were unable to play the game when that one was available?
---
Me, for example. I pre-ordered the game... hoping that at the VERY LEAST the release would be like FO4 where a disc was given and a sizable-but-not-entire-game download would be needed... 
---
Why? I live where AT&amp;T doesn't care about people and so if one street lacks DSL they aren't going to bother rectifying it. So I am limited to Cellular which is expensive and for just 2 lines and a device (my modem) it's $175USD/mo for just 24GB *(does have rollover, but never ends up with much rolling over)*, we won't even get into the horrible-horrible speeds I get despite having two large antennas outside. 
---
This meant that for the 55GB download, I would either have to dedicate over two months of zero-internet usage and only FO76 DL, or multiple multiple months of small FO76 downloading. The other option was to have a friend in another state download it and send it to me... which is what I went with, and she downloaded it for me onto a MicroSD and mailed it to me. Due to a new patch that dropped during the 5days of shipping it, I didn't get to play until Dec 4th! Keep in mind, I pre-ordered this though, so I wasn't late because I held off buying it...
---
Now... mid March I was bored and decided to datamine the files to see what Atom Shop and other interesting item prospects there are... You can imagine my excitement to find, amongst other interesting things, this bad ass black T-series and X-series paint job!! It's named differently in the files, but I come to find out it's called Blackbird... Well as a fan of the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane since the late 80s (when I saw it in a book at my elementary school library), the name made sense!
---
So can you imagine how massively bummed out I became when I found out that it had came and went in the Atom Shop? T\_T 
---
I have the Patriot, Mothman, and Wastelander Camo PA skins (mainly the wastelander due to everything else it contained), and I even came up with what I think is a cool combination of the Patriot and Mothman... So this would've been so awesome to have! In my nearly-400 hours of gameplay  (unless that metric is per-character, then probably 550hr) I haven't come across anyone wearing the Blackbird armor.
---
I assume Blackbird painted PA is the only kind you wear? :)
---
Nukes fail to launch and instantly blow up the Silo instead.
---
Fucking same
---
The thing everyone seems to be overlooking is how thorough the simulation lore could be. If the game is a simulation, then all of the lore we know could be a part of that simulation. 
---
The world outside could be significantly worse, or significantly better. If it‚Äôs a simulation, there‚Äôs nothing to say that this couldn‚Äôt in-fact be a promotional simulation at a vault tech booth at a convention. 
---
‚Äúexperience the ravages of post war life, invest in a secure future today‚Äù
---
Although it seems unlikely it would be so self deprecating in that case. Disgruntled employee maybe?
---
Ah ok, thanks 
---
Same here. When I heard no npcs I heard NOT FOR ME. I actually got it for my son for Christmas thinking he might get into this ‚Äúnew age‚Äù fallout scene like I use to binge play the last 3. He played it once. I‚Äôm so glad my wife told me to play it one night, she‚Äôs probably not, because I play nothing else. Ion level 110(?) and I just now have 3 friends I play with sometimes which truly changes the game! 
---
Hunter long coat? Sold by the responder vendor bot
---
pretty much.. ya got raided.. happens from time to time. im over 200 and i had a 455 come do the same to my base, he was pvp built and i could do nothing to him dmg wise (im pve built), he kinda laughed at me, then asked me if i was mad, said no not really more an annoyance than anything but a quick camp move would fix it all.. and he gave me like four serum recipes to cover repair expenses.. he was such a nice raider.. 
---
1k stims should turn into 4k diluted stims. Without "super duper" that is. 
---
Now I just question where you will source 2k purified.
---
It's really effective. And yes, I've used it a couple of times.
---
Enclave bunker, military wing desks.
---
...okay?
---
Wow it‚Äôs amazing how much work you put into this post. Do you sell PA as well. Looking for some modded T-51b armour :)
---
that's fantastic. Good job.
---
üëç any use is better than no use at all.
---
I do. It‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs competitive. It‚Äôs heart racing. You make good money from it. 
---
That's why I didn't say 4k diluted, the purified is kinda hard to come by for me 
---
They really...dropped the ball on it. haha
---
Seriously though, it could have been a really cool event, but Bethesda's response was "well, it was just a suggestion, guys. We didn't have anything planned."
---
550 caps?
---
Oh that bad boy is far off on the edge of the map far away from any POI. I‚Äôm not worried. I moved there months ago and still have yet to have anyone touch it. 
---
Ah, cool, okay thanks. I wasn't sure if you could still hide your marker or not while being in the top 3. I just assumed you were screwed.
---
So if you sell it you end up in debt for 1/4th the amount of the average college tuition in USA? 
---
Those are for excavator
---
People also don‚Äôt get unlimited resurrections.  I accept that this game is realistic as long as I believe in the magic which runs it. ;)
---
Ahh shit I'm xbox1
---
Anyone else plastic wrapping things in groups of ten or thirty? That‚Äôs when you know you‚Äôre down with the sickness...
---
Heard they were adding seasons lime diablo too, so we should get survival with fresh characters at some point.
---
People are paying caps and real money to buy TSE, BE, IE weapons and Sentinel armor and it makes them instantly good at PvP. I couldn't think of any better example of 'paying to win'.
---
Still waiting for the return of the blackbird armor paint.
---
I was using instagasting hunting rifle for long time, oneshoting most creatures from sneak.
---
After few hours in survival i thought: "fuck that slow reload"
---
Now i have instagasting gauss. It is beast. 
---
Anyway i would suggest handmade. That is just best weapon.
---
That's ok if you want you can pretend we are on voice chat and tell me how you had sex with my mum last night and that your dad owns Bethesda and your going to get my account banned
---
Just let all that anger out
---
Yup, fast travel for those of us who are permanently encumbered.
---
Dmg doesn't really matter if you have a silenced hunting rifle and all rifle+sneakdmg perk cards. You get a x3.15 Bonus Dmg per shot while you sneak, that alone one shots pretty much everything. 
---
Legendary Effects + Speed Mutation + Quick Hands Perk Card are a nice addition to that
---
My Rifle with all effects and legendary is doing 450 dmg per shot when Undetected and i can sit right in the ass of a supermutant and he never sees that coming.
---
Knowledge overload! Don‚Äôt call you lord for nothing bud!
---
Plus ammo smith you can just unequip when your not making ammo.... so use 2 points for something else for when your out in wasteland 
---
And thats different from what literally every other person on this sub is doing how?
---
I'm truely glad that the very small percentage of players absolutely love being able to kill everyone and everything with little to no effort. I'm glad their having fun abusing the mechanics of the game to curb stomp everyone else.
---
That's what survival should be for, but what I don't fucking like, is every god damn challenge thats worth shit, has tp be done in survival.
---
Why stop there tho, why not just set everyone who joins the server to 1 health, no gear an let spawn them in a barrel with everyone who logged in before them at the top with a minigun an unlimited ammo? Accomplishes the same thing.
---
Man. Mine is two shot but it's idk its great but not compared to a normal one with a guaranteed shot. 
---
Also make it so that it's only free after you discover it. This would encourage the whole travel aspect the game has.
---
If they are paying real money, then they are breaking the terms of service and Bethesda should be on top of it. If they're paying in caps, I don't see the issue?. 
---
Leather coat, not hunters
---
This always felt like a stupid mechanic. Not only can they burrow through solid concrete, but you can't move the corpses. Needless to say, my first camp building experience was overwhelmingly frustrating.
---
Also drops from "One of Us"
---
If you're on XB1, I have extra black titanium I'd let go for cheap lol
---
Why no love for mis-matched sets?!??
---
Since there are no bonuses for matches sets like in fo4 I like to mix and match. 
---
 t60 legs because they are so cheap to repair and most damage goes there
---
T60 arms for the same reason, but I‚Äôm considering moving to t51b arms for the looks and slight buff, I have to repair the arms so little I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be a burden 
---
X01 chest, stats and looks. I don‚Äôt have to repair it to often, sports the nuka-paint job 
---
X01 helmet, stats and looks, you can‚Äôt really beat the headlamp being the eyes.  If you can deal with the colored lights, the red is just so bad-ass it hurts. 
---
My 1st bicycle was a lunar rover?
---
So you still get wanted for picking locks but can‚Äôt destroy the base anymore? 
---
Nothing makes you "instantly good" at PvP.. everything has a counter. Just think outside the box.
---
I would appreciate that very much. I can't get on today, but I can get on any time tomorrow if you can?
---
My username is Supermoo9
---
If the entirety of Fallout is a simulation, than it really doesn't matter if it is a simulation or not. Personally, I don't think that's true because it makes it not a compelling universe and story. Even for 76, there's a lot of narratives there that are way less interesting if they're fake in an in-universe sense.
---
Just play around with the camera until you fall in love with one of thr pics you take üëç
---
But the power armor chassis always had 60 damage resistance, and energy, did they take this out ? It was fine last night ?
---
I get that but this happened on the first enemy I attacked. I wasn't about to run through the whole silo and get 1/10th the XP for it. Why would that happen?
---
That is intriguing about Grafton dam, becuase there are alot of super mutant's at Grafton steel, which leads too all the 3 other ingredients needed to make stable flux. Might just nuke it just to see and I may take over the workshop once we kill all the enemies to swan more( workshop events in Nike zone spawn enemies with all those ingredients)
---
Honestly I have to agree.
---
My buddy and I found 3 players shot them all. They had a butt load of loot. Apparently they were transferring between characters. They messages us numerous times to get their loot back.  That isnt something you do in survival mode. Carry the bare essentials. If need to transfer switch modes.
---
Yeah right...... I'm sure every other post on the trading pages are ......W: Assassin's Sentinel...... because of cosmetics.... LOL.
---
Pay for the OP gear and win.
---
ewww girls.  I don't sleep with girls you sicko
---
I got griefed by a lvl200 player with an explosive probably-twoshot railway, who then returned just to mock me in his OP unscratchable probably-duped equipment... ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_\/¬Ø  then Todd decides everyone had the right to keep one of each dupes, effin genius &gt;:|
---
700 for the quad. They don't go around too much for sale. 500 for the double. 
---
You say welded rebar is like reactive plates but for melee, do reactive plates not work for melee? 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen another player in days out in the world. Right now there isn‚Äôt a single player on my server. So much for multiplayer lol
---
I'll take the quad
---
Your my hero dude
---
Honestly, I think the best think they could do for passive perks like that, is to be able to have a class hotfix, where you can switch from your combat build to your crafting build. Would help so we do not have to open menu and switch between perk cards everytime. Have it where you hold up on dpad or something and it switches perk card build.
---
Still wishing workshops were turned into communuty areas where people work together to rebuild like was originally advertised than just glorified PvP points. 
---
Stupid level 80 SB keeps flying into the mountains by WS where my camp is, the dicker yells like an idiot and busts up my mothman shrine/statue set up everytime! Everything else is left alone!
---
All the scorched turn into Daaaaaaaves
---
I think all the un-armed mods for the arms are to help with the ‚Äúpain train‚Äù sprint into enemies mode. 
---
So you can sprint into enemies, damage and possibly stagger, and then with those mods, increase that damage, or add bleeding, or add the energy damage.  
---
But that's not pay to win.. that's player trading??. You can buy some with your hard earned caps if you want to?. Of they were selling xp boosts and stuff in the atomic shop, then I'd delete the game straight away. This ISN'T pay to win, it's a mechanic.
---
Great ACEpickles60 
---
I'm being self indulgent, because a game mode that is clearly being favored, with specific challenges and rewards are being gated and locked an prevented by people who don't want to play fallout. Like this shit aint CoD, or battlefield. You want to curb stomp everyone go play a game that's actually made for shit like that
---
I am level 200. 19lvl guy killed me with few shots from handmade. It is balanced.
---
I haven't had many issues on PS4.  Yesterday my camp was blown up for the first time ever which is surprising considering I have a huge well lit camp on top of the junk pile across the street from Sutton Station.
---
If any of you ever see modivate online, swing by for a visit.  What's mine is yours.
---
I should get some actual pics of it, but here's a photo pointing towards the front door: http://imgur.com/gallery/Lipt8Hf
---
The point is not to get xp. It‚Äôs to launch a nuke. If it gave full xp it would just be a bunch of level 100s running through the silo and not to launch a nuke. The reason there‚Äôs a bunch of enemy‚Äôs is to make it a challenge not give you xp 
---
I've been griefed once. I was at the white spring on my second alt poking around for some plastic and steel to make some shotgun shells before heading on over to Top of the World. Suddenly I have this level 90 on my ass yelling over his mic some nonsense about how I should be doing the story content instead of cheating and farming. He killed me, I went back grabbed my bag and went back to looking for plastic, but he was back a minute later doing the same thing. He eventually fucked off, but it was annoying 5 minutes or so.
---
Thatd be pretty tough on ps4
---
Just a bit of an update there is now a scorchbeast just hanging around my base so it‚Äôs now partly destroyed again 
---
That does seem odd. Haven't run into mole miners there before. And seeing dead ones is also a mystery. I think the game is making it pointless to nuke anything anymore for fun. 
---
Found it! Thanks my guy. 
---
&gt; Legendary items are and always have been quite rare 
---
this isn't even remotely true, the can be farmed just like anything else, legendaries are easier to come by than screws
---
&gt;with decent ones being extremely hard to find and god tier ones being unheard of 
---
also not true, it's RNG, you get what you get, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's crap, your Luck stat and a few others have a lot to do with RNG, also I am almost positive your loadout (equipped weapons and armor) affect the loot you get as well.  you can farm West Tek and Whitesprings for hours on end and come away with a pile of legendaries, captainoob, a YouTuber that reviews legendary items, uses both of the aforementioned locations to test out the legendaries he comes across, getting legendaries in the process.
---
as to the amount of legendary weapons in survival, what do you think it is going to be like for new players in a month or more?  there is always going to be someone new and there is always going to be people with high level gear, end of story.
---
I think this is really good because It gives people the option to just play casually instead of being worried that someone is waiting for you to die so they can finish you off or let you bleed out. I think Bethesda made a great choice.
---
Holy s**t i do that too!! I put on a cultist outfit and have my deathclaw gauntlet with me (500+ dmg ;) ) and chameleon armor so i become invicible when i want, 
---
stalking new players and throwing pulse granades at them and hiding is soo FUN!!!
---
Indeed.  However, it's a bit lame that one of the best ways to get plans, which PVE'ers want, is to enter PVP mode by taking a workshop.  The workshop taking and defence missions should instead award something that's specific to PVP imho.
---
I had 20k caps, its at my mule now.
---
Thankfully because if i get near 800caps from numerous of players, someone kills me twice and bingo i am on zero again.
---
'hard earned caps'
---
Time is money where I come from. If you spend hours on end making runs for caps. That's paying to win in my book.
---
H: no job and 8 hours a day to grind caps W: OP gear to make me good at PVP
---
Then play adventure mode. Nobody is forcing you to play survival. It's in beta so everything is subject to change. If you have such issue with it, open a ticket with Bethesda and submit feedback. You're not forced into PvP in battlefield or cod. They have a story mode.. PvP is an option. You don't have to take that option.
---
Interesting idea but I think there is an easier way. 
---
Explosive Bait makes Scorchbeast land but doesn't always keep them down. So since everything is about Brewing nowadays how about I just make Alcohol-infused Bait... That way when it tries to fly again it'll be drunk and crash into things and die. 
---
give me a cram machine
---
It's not much different from a lot of posts on here.  I usually try and help if I can and if that is what they actually want but are just too angry to relate. Those that want to just complain, I walk away from the thread. Those that I have decided I don't like as a person from my interactions, I block.
---
 I don't agree with all that is going on in survival and I honestly don't think it will stay this way. I think they went too far in trying to negate the long term effects of duped weapons by altering the way pvp is compared to pve.
---
They are 10lvl, if they have 5* it would be still weak 50+. 
---
We had a team hidden at one of our members camps. So ur camp isn't even safe(at least they only took out the turrets).
---
Looks awesome! I personally wouldn't be able to build a CAMP knowing it'll become a no-zone one day, though :(
---
Inconvenient when it throws you in the opposite intended direction tho
---
Once your build becomes more pure you will usually have only a few weapons you‚Äôll likely hold onto. Make sure to bulk everything you can and look through your junk for items not yet scrapped. If you are using perks that reduce weight on items sometimes it is better just to carry them on person, examples like ammo and aid items.
---
Like you know, there was beta. Just correcting you. Now lets do downvoting fight?
---
They should actually have hordes big enough where people actually need help. Everyones a oneman army with a sledge hammer lol
---
Make sure you bulking all junk .  Watch your ammo ( missiles/nukes ) - keep only legendaries or weapons your using.  Make sure any power armor items are on a frame.  Sell everything else.  
---
I hate these workshop. Contest system is broken as if you build defences like automatic turret. In the same instant as someone attack or contest these workshop's (even when you are playing pacifist mode) you are marked as PVP enabled and then these bullies just kill you with 2-3 shots and when you are spawn back and go to see what the nuka happened, you are killed again and again.
---
My solution is just use these workshops as temporary place to build my trunk without needing to move my C.A.M.P  and bull all non essental stuff to it and then leave. I had much better luck with my own camp as currently they are little harder to spot If you dont stay too long time in your camp.
---
Look at what material it has in it. If it's black titanium it's Excavator pieces. If it's ultracite then it's an Ultracite armor mod. Steel is Raider mods.
---
The adventure server are cold and empty now there is zero conflict I was on for 5 hours last night and no one to have an interaction with felt lonely like when I reached level 300 in fallout4
---
Sure, make the .50 mod for the rifle do more damage. And make it make the rifle weigh 30lbs, and the billets weigh .5lbs each
---
Oh and let‚Äôs do the same for the 50cal machine gun. Up the damage on that bad boy, and let‚Äôs see that weight at a realistic 80lbs, with a 70lb box mag of 250 rounds.
---
I scrap most weapons. I have about 4 I use regularly. I always sell outfits, scrap armor pieces, and sell garbage legendaries to vendors. Unless your have the perks for it, Missles, mini nukes, and cores will kill your stash space. Also, keep power armor pieces on the chassis, that way it‚Äôs a straight 10 pounds for the whole set up.
---
***HYDROPONIC WEED GROW MOD FALLOUT76 PART 69/420: INDICA/SATIVA HYBRIDIZATION AND STRAIN CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS***
---
Bulk your junk. If you aren't going to be using a certain type of weapon or armor. Get rid of it. No sense in stashing miniguns if you are using shotguns. Same with fusion cores and ammo. Nukes, plasma/fusion cores and missiles are heavy.
---
It would actually be pretty cool if the crops you can plant depended on your location.  Make your camp in the cranberry bog, and you can grow cranberries, for example.
---
He ran out of caps after the third kill, I was doing it for the leaderboard. I killed him 44 times before I got bored and stopped. I‚Äôm not the devil for playing the game, like I said I don‚Äôt care, this is for the low levels who complain that it‚Äôs unfair for high levels to be in survival. It‚Äôs not like a level 9 is going to have 4000 caps. He didn‚Äôt even have aid. I was doing it to prove the point that he shouldn‚Äôt be playing survival, I was two shotting him too so do complain that my OP level 50 weapons were too hard on him. I was telling him to switch servers the entire time and he was being stubborn. Don‚Äôt tell me I did anything wrong. This is the equivalent to destroying turret bases as far as I can see.
---
Not a very good stalker if y‚Äôall knew they were there
---
Anyone sick of hitting the ball into the goalpost just for one goal in soccer? I've been playing soccer for decades now. All I want is one point.
---
They've been in the game since launch you've been living in the  vault to long .
---
Remember that if you're using weight reduction perks, they only effect your inventory, your stashbox is not. So be careful on hoarding stimpacks, purified water and other such items
---
I have four of em. Maybe there will be a companion in the future...
---
It does seem quieter, which is nice.
---
They clearly understand how broken pvp is. Bethesda staff did a live twitch stream and a single player owned their 4-men party and killed them over and over they was so pissed. That was months ago and nothing's changed. Nerfs are coming you say? It should have happened before they launched survival mode. Some would say 'uhhhh it's beta so it's okay to be a bit fuked up duhhh' well, it's not just about survival mode. it's pvp balance in general. it been broken for 5 months now and nothing's changed. 
---
Though I understand that devs are working on future dlcs and maybe that's why they cannot put too much effort into balancing pvp. If that is the case, I'm perfectly fine with it. This game was never about pvp anyways. Although I kinda don't understand why they launched survival mode in the first place. I mean, it's clearly broken, why encourage pvp?
---
I had the same issue from Tuesday until yesterday.  Nothing was spawning in the desks in the military wing desks.  I went and did the Biv Daily and when I came back things started spawning.
---
They definitely changed something in Tuesday‚Äôs patch.
---
My first cellphone was a motorcycle?
---
Precious, precious aluminium.
---
With ability to mix nuka cola flavors for different strains of ‚Äúwasteland hemp‚Äù
---
I keep wondering why people keep making posts like this and why do people keep responding them with the same exact messages... then it hit me. Responding to these threads as negative as possible are one of the easiest ways to gain karma. So I decided the next time these threads appear, I will be testing this out. All I have to do is say "this guy is a duper and deserves to stay ban" and people will be hitting those thumbs up in no time.
---
I think its harder at lower levels because your gear breaks so fast. But, stop saving everything... springs, gears, aluminum, screws, adhesive, ballistic fiber; those are the necessities. Oh, make sure you‚Äôre scrapping your junk too (hopefully that goes without saying)
---
Watch your aid and gun powder, these will fill up fast, especially if you aren‚Äôt crafting ammo regularly.  Pick a food and stick with that... soups are good early on or dog food with the Good Doggy perk. 
---
Don‚Äôt carry around a bunch of ammo or weapons you aren‚Äôt going to use (but save 5.56 or shells for trade). 
---
Use some weight reduction perks early on until you get the hang of it but don‚Äôt rely on them or you will handicap yourself late game. 
---
I have a Toad Eye in my Misc Stash Box that has zero weight and no image to look at. I keep it just for the purpose of being a non interactive item in my inventory.
---
That's when you have no pieces equipped.
---
Pocketed ammo gives u 5 plus carry weight and it stacks..just an FYI..crafting ammo also helps..and a friend if mine suggested to me that anything 1* or no *..get rid of
---
The other day I fast traveled to vault 76 and gave a noob all my unused ammo
---
Sometimes. Still have the odd person who follows you around and keeps trying to initiate pvp.
---
Have 50 or less of anything other then plastic ,no bulk, steel and lead , nothing other then really valuable chems ( survival mode ) and all my cosmetic treasures 
---
Assistant *to* the manager
---
I enjoy playing survival mode for about five minutes before adventure mode. It‚Äôs nice to lose 1000 caps and all my canned dog food and stimpaks and get my carrying weight down. 
---
There's attack dogs that'll come at you during the SBQ fight. I've heard they're elsewhere (someone here has a tamed one) but I've only seen them there. I've got two dog armors so far but ofc no puppers to put one on. Maybe one day.
---
Interesting, I like that both as a hunter and as a prey.
---
No it‚Äôs all the time no matter what it stacks with the armor pieces and mine when the pieces aren‚Äôt equipped only has it a 2 damage and 2 energy resistance so what gives ?

After level 50 further level ups don't change your stats. After that it's all about fine tuning your build with better perks and gears.
---
He‚Äôs going to need to change his business cards.
---
Some fucker pestered me to open trade for 30+ mins and I finally did, he requests an AAE Combat Rifle of which I dont use much so I requested something myself. He starts going on about how skeptical he is because people are shady and such so I told him I'd 0 value it first as a show of good faith, dude takes my weapon, says "thanks dawg" and leaves server. Personally, I'm a fairly wealthy player, the weapon means nothing to me, but I have to say: Turok_3D from PSN: go fuck yourself you dodgy little cunt. 
---
Funny that the drawing distance seems to be less then 100( whatever ingame measure distance is used by engine )
---
My explosive tesla is the only weapon I can kill myself without giving me rads.
---
That's a ridiculous comparison 
---
bro this was over a month ago
---
You and that button
---
Damn... okay, final offer. 89 caps, some cola perk bubblegum a perfectly preserved piece of pie and 6 Tin cans? AAAaaand! - 13 10mm rounds!
---
I think everything is in a seasonal rotation. Oddly there are items datamined back from November that have yet to appear.
---
U are south then
---
You can still destroy bases they haven't changed that yet
---
Not what I wsa saying, scorched ones are glitched they will destroy your camp then die. You can only get a level 20 one. 
---
Not sure on those. Particularly the "Decrease" ones, as they don't make sense. Agility governs Sneaking. Endurance governs Disease. Fall damage I think should be a combination of Strength and Agility. 
---
As for the increases... it *could* be something like **adding** that there's a chance of higher-crit damage.   
---
Dodge is already added *and* governed by the Agility perk so that wouldn't really work out. Plans from scrapping depends on what you mean...   
---
Plan for a mod for scrapping that weapon? Random plan found when scrapping *any* item (junk included)?   
---
Quest rewards and drops (in general) are apparently already governed by Charisma... The higher your charisma the better the drops. Your level of Luck applies to how much durability they have upon looting. So with that said, I think the Luck should apply to what you get/find instead of Charisma. However, since that's a massive change, having it apply to something smaller like just obtaining a Plan or additional Legendary reward from quests/events isn't a bad idea.
---
I don't know if Luck is already tied to whether or not a Legendary mob spawns, but if it isn't then that'd certainly be a good application for it. :P
---
Sigh, guess I will keep not playing for now.
---
That's one of the reason I love mods so much. In f04 there's a mod that lets you grow ALL the things. Love having a huge tarberry farm and planting silt beans in the Mechanist lair etc. I can't wait to get mods and I hope we can do all the things we can do in f04 with them... but probably not
---
Great write up!   
---
I think it's worth mentioning "Optimized Bracer" are broken, and have been since the B.E.T.A. Making them, ATM, completely useless.  
---
The exact fix has been reported to Bethesda a few times, and hopefully we will see it in a future update.
---
Most of those are kamas not sickles
---
Level in game doesn‚Äôt define anything , intent does 
---
Before the patch I had it once when I was in the ash heap,now I just go to Camden and it triggers for me.
---
That sentence doesn't make sense. Did you even get your Grade 10?
---
Epic
---
100% agree.
---
It's a gameplay mechanic. Deal with it. If you everyone could do it since 2008 across 4 games, so can you. Plus it gives you XP too so what's the harm?
---
Except you ARE forced to play survival if you want to do the challenges
---
Very strange. I'm disappointed. I love the vane aesthetic in this game. The rifle skin works perfectly, but no love for the shotgun. First they forget to put it in. Now its bugged!
---
Hi disappointed, I'm dad!
---
Julian doesn't have time for the Jacob Collins level of whining in the OP.
---
Always check the blue suit case as I put known plans in there.

IMO they should make those mods more like syringers hut simultaneously useful. I.e. with a scanner receiver you could shoot bolts that give aoe enemy highlight from the bolts landing for a short period, the highlight similar to effect of that particular mentats (berry?). Or an explosive bolt. Or an ap-drain bolt.
---
If ur below lvl 50 u actually do need help sometimes..
---
If ur talking about stuff like duct tape and desk fans..once u loot them they won't appear or be avail for u to grab for 20 hours..they might appear for u again but u won't be able to grab them 
---
Same boat as you.
---
 My stash is full and I have way too much aid and caps on my person to even attempt to go on to survival.
---
I am NOT a duper sir, I explained what happened and that the junk came from dupers.  Bethesda sent me multiple emails stating that I will be able to play again but they have not told me when. I just wanted to know when they were lifting the ban that is all!! I know nothing about karma or likes or thumbs ups... this is my first post in reddit 
---
Every special has 2 passive benefits. Str is carry weight and melee damage. Per is detection range and VATS accuracy. End is health and sprint AP drain rate. Charisma is buy/sell rate and perk card sharing. Int is crafting max durability and XP gain rate. Agility is max AP and sneak ability. Luck is crit gain rate in VATs and found loot max durability. 
---
For what you‚Äôre asking you‚Äôd need to overhaul all the SPECIAL to keep it balanced.
---
Yeah. It needs to be really revamped. 
---
Only a child or an adult with a child's mind would seek offense in a video game built around the themes present in FO.
---
Agreed. I really love that I can go back and forth. Surviving is fun, but stressful. Adventure is chill but less eventful. 
---
If you don't have it installed Todd comes to your house with a bat telling you to go to the nearest gamestop and purchase the entire stock of skyrim remastered 
---
&gt;  I mean, pvp's clearly broken, why encourage it?
---
Hopefully they are moving toward all PVP taking place in survival mode.  I say nerfs are coming because they have happened with TSE and demolition expert.   And back then  the problems were nowhere near as obvious.
---
For all intents and purposes, PVP did not exist before survival mode.   Agreed upon PVP found in adventure mode doesn't count. Even workshop griefing doesn't count because workshops didn't produce much.  Losing one to another player wasn't that big of a deal.
---
In survival mode, the brokenness of PVP is inescapable. 
---
Find the strings of characters that remove a word. It becomes much easier
---
ü§Æ
---
Thats why there should be an icon that shows up on the map when u shoot the flare..
---
The reward for which is a terrible roll legendary.. if you're that desperate for it. There are no other rewards. All the others can be done in adventure mode. 
---
The game warns everyone, including new players that claiming the workshop will initiate pvp. I will admit though, as a new player it‚Äôs not what you would expect, you to get pvp‚Äôed and being given the miscellaneous mission at the time made you think you had to get the job done.
---
This mask is better than the recent ones
---
Do you purchase X-01 mods?  I have a collection of them and I doubt I'll use them.
---
I suppose they should have never gotten rid of the repair mechanic in 4 or skyrim right? 
---
They should streamline this imo. 
---
Just do one I've tryed more and they still give me the usual apart from a few days ago I got the bos knight power armor paint.
---
Yea I have one, too.
---
I'm hoping the Grey Wolf can wear it once tamed, since Wolves and Shepherds are not that dissimilar looking (probably same model heh).
---
Yeah you'll need a second email.
---
Neither of the underground areas are Vaults, one is a cave system by Harpers Ferry called the Burrows, the other is some kind of underground lab for Arktos Pharma. 
---
That would be amazing honestly. Custom colors for outfits, custom paints and decals for power armor. Making custom tats, new hairstyles... I just want more customization and uniqueness! 
---
I saw two wanted players attacking my neighbors base so switched pacifist mode off took 2 shots both of them dropped. Turned pacifist back on and went on my merry way. 
---
 I was even nice enough to leave their junk bags.
---
You left out one point: while burrowed, molerats/radscorpions can still give you a disease.
---
You may also want to mention Raider PA can not be crafted outside of plans found in the dev room. You couldn't even craft it in FO4
---
Well....I don't have a handmade but I can attest. My lvl 12 has killed quite a few high lvl 200+ players with all kinds of crap. I even 2 shotted a lvl 150 something with a starter 10 mm pistol. Level has NO effect on pvp wins vs losses.
---
Kind of off-topic, but the landmarks quest wasn‚Äôt cut from New Vegas was it? Don‚Äôt you talk to some artist guy in the building next to Vault 21 for it?
---
Set each xbox as the "home" system for the other account. It's great for muling.
---
Lmao. "Another BagGate". No they fucking aren't. Get over yourself
---
I love the hacking mechanic 
---
Wait explosive bait actually makes scorch beast land? How does this great power work?
---
burn him at the stake why don't you.
---
I carry all my aid on me because it weighs less on my character with travelling pharmacy and thru hiker, I keep 50 silver crystal and gold, 200 ballistic fibre, Screws and spring everything else I keep 100 in mats, I keep 10 of each stable flux plus 10 hardened mass in my stash, glowing mass and irradiated fluids I keep on my character as it weighs less, I have a set of x01, t51, ultracite and t60 in my stash and mostly wear my excavator, the rest of my stash is filled with legendary weapons I‚Äôm waiting to scrap with the legendary vendor and some outfits I‚Äôve collected along the way that I‚Äôd like to keep. I also have 1 of every bobble head in there waiting for when we can display them in our camps. Once the legendary vendor comes in May and all the weapons I have to turn in and scrap are out of my stash il have more room to play with as I‚Äôm at max atm.
---
If you're like me, you're waiting on player vending is why it's so full. Once a few of these weapons sell, mine will go back down.
---
But others basically hit the nail square on the head. 
---
Bulk and sell junk you don't use much. 
---
The weapons and armor you don't want, sell or trade away. Only keep weapons and armor that are sentimental or useful. For example, I keep a handmade and 44 long barrel around for when I rp as Rick Grimes. 
---
Thru Hiker maxed out means you don't have to keep all your food and drink in your stash. (Though, if we get a cooler like the butcher had during Fasnacht Day, this may change. u/LadyDevann is this coming?)
---
Travelling Pharmacy also helps by lowering the weight of chems but if you're melee, you have to sacrifice points in Gladiator or Slugger. Idk if I'm willing to do that just yet. I have to test it. 
---
I tried all day yesterday couldn't get it to spawn :(
---
You can also spawn at your own camp, not just the closest train station.
---
It's super rare, unfortunately it takes awhile
---
I have a two shot and TSE tesla and have noticed the same thing (bugged damage).
---
Yeah, I just learned that today actually from googling. I'll try looking for that from now on.
---
Is the charged tesla rifle mod still causing players to crash when meleed?
---
Killed three times by the same two guys that were 80-130 levels over me, in adventure mode
---
Will try another time. 
---
Alright just gimme a few minutes. 
---
I'd envision they'd be able to use the fast travel system if that's what they were aiming for heh Granted, it is nice to physically have them travel the distance, but don't know if they actually do when summoned via the quest. 
---
I'd think that keeping x-amount of Cargo Bots all active would take up more processing time than having them spawn a new one in. After I found out what they were I kinda thought they just ended up there after someone summoned one. Maybe today I'll do that... Go check out Point Pleasant and get a base-count on them and then use my 20-some drop holos and see if all 20 end up in the holding pattern swarm... :)
---
Helvetia?
---
Look closer at the church! 
---
I actually had to jump servers twice this morning cuz someone actually built a camp where mine is hidden. Dunno if I got put back on the same server, but it was crazy to find out someone else found my spot lol
---
I paid 100 a piece for stable, but then again I don't pay attention to "the going rate" if I need something I'll offer whatever I think will get it for me. Caps aren't usually an issue.
---
Glenn has very fair prices, always true to his word. Great seller 10/10
---
Flatwoods?
---
I agree that Survival is more calmed down now that the griefers have somewhere to torture people lol
---
Power armour is terrible for PvP , so most people use legendary armour with the sentinel and assassin legendary effects to mitigate damage from players.
---
&gt;
---
As someone else said , once you‚Äôre over level 50 , it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre level 900 or 51 , the damage you‚Äôre dealing to each other doesn‚Äôt change so they have no advantages, so at this point it‚Äôs up to you and your perk choices to wether you have the advantage in pvp or not.
---
Why not? Not many people destroy bases anyways. 
---
Is that really the only thing holding you back?
---
I thought it was only the arms you needed to mine more for the excavator PA?
---
Thank you sir. Always happy to do business. My shop will be open later this evening. It's 18.23 uk time here. I expect to online around 9pm.
---
Harpers ?
---
I fucking hate being on the leaderboards. Gotten to the point where I'll kill myself as soon I'm near or on the boards
---
You could put the upgrades to mode your gun to do this better in the work station,could be lag sometime when I aim down the scope the shot is way off just change weapon then back again fixes this.
---
I have several fusion generators and a decontamination shower, a week or two ago some chuckle fuck destroyed my generators and shower. 
---
Harpers Ferry. I‚Äôm just here for the soothing voice 
---
Yup was a lvl 40 and had to kill a stranger mirelurk queen lvl60 3*** messages people on my server to help me kill it they came as soon as they got the call and took her out I thanked them by spaming heart emotes
---
That was my guess too 
---
Awesome!  That didn't even cross my mind.  I can get the life giver without adding more points then!
---
\*bzzzzt\*
---
Everything else about the game is fine, but that's the deal breaker. Appalachia doesn't want ya brother 
---
When I get bored I jump into Survival mode, drop EVERYTHING  before I leave the vault and make someone burn up some ammo, when I  respawn, which I can ONLY do at the Vault I still have nothing when I show up, figure if I do this another 2 or 3 thousand times then made the ‚Äúcamper‚Äù will run out of ammo, or give away his position to someone else they might be good enough to clear my path off the hill.  I just hope Bethesda is watching the stats and sees how the current setup doesn‚Äôt work.  Only wish I had the Last Laugh perk...
---
I dunno. I was peacefully constructing a workshop yesterday and some level 137 power armored asshole came charging out of nowhere and killed me. He hit me, I reacted instinctively and fired back (dammit I was on pacifist!) then I got one-shotted.  
---
I always build workshops open to the general public, I don't lock things unless I need them, I'm a generally nice player. But this a-hole made me frustration-quit. This was my first time playing in months, and I can't build a damn base!
---
Hopefully more a-holes like that guy go over to survival, but I think some are just bullies.
---
I honestly think people are still mad the game is multiplayer. I really don‚Äôt think this game is subject to more greifing than any other online game. It just come with the territory of being online.
---
People who love classic single player Fallout seem to look for any reason to knock it, and griefing is the easiest thing to complain about.
---
A few other bosses would be nice.
---
A behemoth or mirelurk Queen that was as hard to kill as the SBQ would be fun.
---
This is why private servers will be awesome. I‚Äôd love to give this a try. 
---
*\*record scratches\**  
---
Yep, that's me. You may be wondering how I ended up in this situation
---
No, not being sarcastic but of course I know that‚Äôs the way it is supposed to work. But it literally is only giving me the option of respawning at the Whitesprings station. Like some sick joke from Bethesda.  Not my camp, not the vault, not any of the other train stations. 
---
I even took video clips of it. 
---
Cool, I want to visit!
---
It‚Äôs a good thing I don‚Äôt care what you thinküëå
---
I'm going to run it a few times tonight after I get home from work. Haven't nuked it for about 5 days now so I hope they didn't mess up the spot. 
---
Cult mask + Clown Outfit?  
---
Great!
---
\*ding\* \*ding\* \*ding\* we got a winner!

 [https://imgur.com/a/xhNKUhO](https://imgur.com/a/xhNKUhO) 
---
Cool, thanks!  That's what I'm doing now.  Just making sure I'm not missing something big by throwing 11 points into luck.
---
Yeah that would be cool! 
---
I agree dude. It appears most of these people who post in forums are very negative when others don't share their view points. I personally like the game in both modes. Most of the time ots great, occasionally I run into asshats. Most of the time my interactions are pretty good
---
I like his posts. He's got a certain charm, an endearing style, to his sarcasm.
---
What about survival prevents you from server hopping?
---
I don‚Äôt get the last part , it‚Äôs a beta because they‚Äôre experimenting with it, it‚Äôs not the finished mode , I believe they‚Äôve addressed this either in an interview or in one article.
---
I have 3 water purifiers at my Base and keep one unlocked as my door as I don't mind players using it,but Bethesda needs to stop people damaging your Base it would be good if when a player damages your camp their camp takes damage instead.
---
Do you even get xp for player kills? If you want to grind xp there's several ways to do it like 10 times faster and with less hassle.
---
I think it's because pvp is so broken that were able to enjoy the simplicity of it.
---
This man RWBYs
---
Get good? You chose to PvP, you died...
---
Yes, heavy weapons even recently got a buff.
---
Correct!
---
[https://imgur.com/a/roOBSIf](https://imgur.com/a/roOBSIf) 
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying!! It‚Äôd be nice to see those things more often from a nuke. 
---
I do 40 or 50 per for violet
---
ty! I think this fixed the game for me. I will test more with fullscreen optimizations off as well!
---
I have played since Beta almost every day and my base has only been destroyed one time and that was from a nuke
---
Admittedly, they shouldn't have. No weapon degradation meant melee was incredibly easy to use. A melee weapon needed no maintainance and tou could sell all the ammo to get rich quickly, which essentially made it feel cheaty in Fallout 4. 
---
Like chest piece armors to match the helmet? That's awesome
---
Well, I pvp a lot even before survival mode. and it's been broken for quite some time but they never bothered to fix it. Nerfs are gonna come? sure. but when's it gonna come? that is the issue. Tse nerfs? Yeah it did land but when did it happen? It took them more than 3 months to address such an obviously game breaking issue. So when is this pvp balance patch gonna take place? maybe next week if we are lucky. but is a single fix gonna do any good? hell no. At least more than a dozen fixes are needed and we are not even sure if first hotfix is taking place come maintenance. It's gonna take them months bro. and I'm pretty sure pvp's still gonna be broken by then
---
No mods, mods are bad!
---
How much would you need to put emergency protocols on my ultracite?
---
Got a 3* revolutionary sword from her yesterday 
---
Dont be a fucking dick
---
This. At the moment it's obviously rigged for griefing though. I want pvp servers, so that I can fight if I want, or really so that you have that, I never know if I'll survive because my enemy and I are equal in all but wits, feeling. This isn't that. Kinda wish it had been.
---
Why?
---
Had this happen before too. The nuke was there but nothing was acting right. No glowing ones, no flux, not even radiation. All of a sudden the nuke exploded like 10 minutes later and killed everyone there lmao. Worked fine after that. 
---
You should make an alt to get your hat back. 
---
Where can I find this mask? I had one and scrapped it accidentally.
---
Do you guys think its a gpu problem too much stress during sbq im upgrading to a 1660 ti xc see if that helps loading n lag /freezes.
---
So when I die, naturally out in the world, adventuring in Survival mode for extra XP and all that, just like Bethesda is intending - if I want to go and try to pick up my sack I have to make it thru the gauntlet at Whitesprings. I could prob server hop and fix it but well, I want my bag back it‚Äôs my right lol
---
I had one that was all bots including level 1 legendary eyebots. 
---
That makes your theory completely pointless.  If you can never know anything, no theory matters.
---
There is nothing against mix&amp; match sets in this game. I have a T60 set with stealth boy that I‚Äôm using it with X-01 helmet. Raider helmet looks great on ultracite as well. 
---
Lol Survival mode encourages you to keep just the bare minimum. Did you skip over the current rules before entering?
---
Fair. I've made angry posts. But, to also be fair, this still just feels like more making up for the bad launch. Keep in mind we are still just now getting things that were asked for on day one. After 6 months some standard has to be achieved. This isn't a small indy company. We should have some expectations. Even for a Beta. 
---
Well, not to be rude or anything but survival does say you drop aid items while dying, and carrying all of your aid items going in there wasn't a smart idea tbh, like bringing in all of your junk yknow?
---
If you can get to watoga you can kill the robots for aluminium plus the school has plenty.
---
Gratz on 300! Wow
---
So you are bad at the game and don't understand how to play it, so yeah I guess you should uninstall because you're wasting only your time and no one else cares.
---
I wasn't, if you go into a pvp area, you have to expect to be killed, you cant file being shot as a bug. Yes, limited stash is a pain, yes it sucks he lost all that good shit, but he lot fair and square.
---
You fucking get over yourself.
---
Not at all, raider plans are in game, can be found from treasure maps, I can construct most of except a few pieces  
---
Didn't say it wold happen fast.   I'm thinking about the long term here.   I said that I wouldn't really mess with survival until after a few months had past because I think is how long it will take to even come close to straightening this mess out.
---
I had my friend killed me to find out what I would drop and then when I saw the list I just left and uninstalled
---
Primed crossbows are too expensive to make ammo for and cannot be unprimed to a wooden stock.
---
Maybe stash your stuff?. It does tell you what's going to happen when you choose the mode. Don't want to drop it? Stash it. üëçüëç
---
It fully refutes it if true.  So you cannot use this piece of evidence to supplier your theory.
---
Yeah, events aren't really worth it. If I'm near one, I'll do it if I'm in the mood, but most of the time I'm not and just ignore them.
---
It works for me though, a power attack consumes 15% of AP without it, 10% with it. Might be related to different sets or weapons. Good to know though
---
I stopped at over 900 days on my character as time played
---
If we talk about undergrounds, you are going underground at so much building but we are not talking about undergrounds must be vault. You can missing what I'm pointing, it's okey. Please read again and you will figure out that I'm talking about they teased a undergrand and added vault 51.
---
They do. The main difference is, reactive plates makes you still get the damage. With the rebar, you don‚Äôt get damage (if it triggers)
---
That‚Äôs honestly a really good idea 
---
Lol. You made it sound so sad bro
---
Just needs fixing; not elimination. Limit the distance they can move underground before they're forced to surface, and adjust where/what materials they can surface from.
---
Burrowing itself is a cool mechanic that *does* add to the gameplay, but it's very poorly implemented right now
---
After reading this, my hope for the gaming community is restored. Y'all could be colossal dicks, but choose instead to get your bounties with Sweet Rolls. That is literally the most legendary way to accrue a bounty I've ever heard.

I've been hiding in bed all week being eaten alive by my PTSD and this thread cheered me up so much I think I'm going to get out of bed and go do some gardening while I have sunshine.
---
Seriously, Fallout 76 Fam. Thanks for being the least dick of the gaming community so far. I did not expect to find Canada in Appalachia. And coming here after leaving WoW makes me appreciate all that much more.
---
I've recently started a new character and I've seen higher level characters run by, and then run back to help me finish them. Most people love helping lower level characters, so if they saw a noob with a bunch of high level mobs they'd probably just be more inclined to help. 
---
Excellent write up.  I would only add that +2 INT gives a very minor XP boost.  Run around whitespring with and without it (or berry mentats/brain soup) and you‚Äôll see the difference.
---
Yes, it's insane because it's still not completely balanced but a lv 5 still has a chance against a 200 with a rifle at range it's kinda nice at times. Just be ready to lose a lot of caps and gain them back
---
Ah, well that's disappointing. Thanks for the info
---
The healing factor has saved me on stimpack I now farm them and sell them at venders.
---
How does bulking help? Only one item has a significant reduced weight. 
---
Should have utilized some punji boards or something
---
Do more! 
---
I guess you didn't read the warning that appears when you start survival...
---
The game TELLS YOU THAT YOU WILL LOSE ITEMS. It's only your fault. If you want to be pissed at someone look in a mirror and be pissed at that person.
---
I actually agree. I liked the repair. But I'm losing patience with these terminals haha
---
[here‚Äôs a link with this weeks codes](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-nuke-codes/) 
---
I get that it's frustrating but there's a warning when logging in that says you can lose your stuff. I made an alt specifically to avoid that. It sucks starting over but I am lvl 148 and have over 300 various stims, 70 radaway, mutation serums and chems. My lvl 6 alt has only been killed once and that's cause I stopped paying attention for a moment. I lost a roll of toilet paper and 1 stim. Lol. 
---
Well, it is just a video game, it was never presented to us as a reality simulator.  So you can‚Äôt use game mechanics to try to prove anything.
---
It's actually amazing how accurate most locations are portraiyed!
---
Nice camp, where did you get the plans for the decontamination arch?
---
If it needs a long term fix, why launch survival mode in march? Fix pvp and then launch. That's how it should happen
---
To make wine you need tarberries and black berries which makes no sense.  You should be able to make it with just blackberries or tarberries plus water and sugar. 
---
once you hit top do you get hunted down
---
Yeah they increased the fire rate of heavy weapons and decreased dmg but it‚Äôs about the same dmg so they‚Äôre still a win to play with 
---
Not launched a nuke yet been playing since launch :)
---
Do you know the brackets thing to remove duds and reset tries? That makes hacking a lot easier. Also always do words with E (the mist xommon letter of the alphabet) and ones that end with ing (that way if you get a match of 3 or more, chances are good that your word ends with ing as well).
---
So much better now that most of the trolls have gone back under the bridge to pvp world. 
---
It really is and give them kudos for it. I‚Äôm planning a week long trip to WV in June and I can‚Äôt wait to see the locations irl 
---
GT is the same. Shoot an inv
---
They will do, check the preview for patch 8
---
Only keep some scrap to build/repair weapons and what you need to supply your camp and bulk/sell or drop everything else.  I run in PA so I do not need leather, I farm a lot of gunpowder, so I don‚Äôt need cloth or Acid, and I only keep enough plastic to bulk a few items.  Drop all dupe plans, don‚Äôt keep ammo for weapons you don‚Äôt have.  Read the Wiki on stuff you want to build and make a list on paper and then only farm/keep that.  Read up on what you need for weapons/armor repairs and only keep 2 set of repair parts on hand.  If you suck at finding springs (like I do) then keep more of that item.  Took me since the BETA to finally get a handle on how to manage my stash, and I am finally getting close.
---
Hi what is you psn i want to visit you 
---
Awesome!! You on console or pc?
---
People are posting on Xbox Live LFG either giving away free stuff or buying with crazy good prices to bait people to come in. Someone tried to say their game crashed after I joined them in Adventure and sent me an invite to rejoin them, then refused to actually join me so I assume they logged out and switched to survival hoping I'd switch and spawn next to them.
---
permaban helps
---
Same. Or lock picking a container in a claimed shop. 
---
?
---
I hope so! I don't mind having to wait a little while as long as the items come back eventually. Also, yeah, there are even Atomic Shop items that have been in the game files since beta, and they've never been sold. I wonder if or when we'll ever see those. 
---
Somehow I can actually picture Papa Todd saying this at a dev meeting.
---
I don‚Äôt think it does make a difference in Fo76. It surely does in FO4. But XP gained from creatures is static in this game. It can be buffed only by well rested and consumes less
---
Any mods installed?.
---
That is kind of ironic. I get so annoyed with the ‚Äúgriefer‚Äù hate though. You mean, in a lawless post apocalypse people blow up your living room? Ive been griefed a few times. I grief people who piss me off, its all part of the experience. 
---
it's a useless perk regardless imo.
---
After I finished my CAMP, I only kept the necessities to repair weapons, armor and PA...and to craft ammo when needed.
---
You get them from the scorchbeast queen.
---
Excellent work u/lordbaronstein, you beat me to print by about two days, you magnificent bastard! 
---
I‚Äôd like to add that I‚Äôve been playing with PA builds for a while now as well, and the T60 build I call ‚ÄúStealth Incursion‚Äù is on of my favorites..  
---
VATS Matrix
---
Stealth Boy torso
---
Optimized Servos
---
So the idea is it‚Äôs a Power Armor for those stealth sniper builds, with the ability to run longer distances to get to your sniping position quickly when you have to leave the Stealth Field protection.
---
I can take a look, please dm what you have
---
Just imagine, having played hundreds of hours of a game, then unawaringly wandering into a location like that.
---
I'd imagine a very very eairy feeling of deja vu!

Here's the tunnel, they even got the cliffs right:

If you steal from someone you ought to expect consequences. It literally says STEAL instead of TAKE.
---
I do get tired of it, same with lock picking. Yes, I know about removing duds and resetting tries, but after 39484285085902582098 hacks and locks it's just a minor slow down before whatever I'm doing can continue.
---
and before you get ur paint jobs every 1000 techs turned in. LOL

I'm not downvoting you. It's the other people that think you're being needlessly arrogant

Start a new character...

The term you're looking for here is "asshole filter".

Basically, something has emerged and it's filtering out all the assholes and moving them somewhere else.  
---
Glassed cavern has a bos body at the end of it with a piece of bos armor most of the time it's heavy you can go there once a day I had a full set in about a week.
---
How do I do that? Sorry, I am new to the game
---
Not egouth servers probably. Sometimes it puts me on same server for 30mins, sometimes there are 3different servers. But not like i could server hop like in old days.
---
Mothman museum, on the west side of the map. If you look up and down that side you‚Äôll see the town that has a mothman sign on the map. Then it‚Äôs in the basement I believe.
---
Survival mode feels like a failed ideal, much like how this game was seen by the larger internet community at release.

It would be cool to simulate all the dangerous social dynamics of a post-nuclear scenario... never knowing when to trust strangers (but not automatically killing them), relying on each other's help to survive, roaming gangs, people trading for supplies, etc... but in a simulated video game environment how much of that is actually practical? Real people don't buy a game to spend their time role playing as an NPC would. So to have mechanics and game design that are dependent on people doing that makes for a more hollow experience. 
---
For survival mode to work the way they envision, people would need to have reasons not to kill someone on sight just because they can (essentially "role-playing" as a nice guy sometimes is completely unrewarded, even discouraged). Adding a leader board just makes the entire map one big killzone, and it ends up catering entirely to groups of only the most active players killing each other while ignoring much of the rest of the game. If it's meant to be a mode about survival, don't also make it a manhunt. There's nothing stopping anyone with enough time on their hands from stockpiling everything they need in adventure mode and then laying waste to anyone trying to play survival mode without completely cheesing it. 
---
Then I think the fact that they removed one more impractical attempt to simulate their whole "players as NPC's" game design by removing slap damage from Adventure mode makes the experience feel safer and less convoluted there. Casual players don't have to feel like they are seen as the scrub NPC's in the hardcore players' world, and can enjoy the game a little bit more akin to other Fallout games.
---
Yes, unfortunately.
---
Oh awesome!! Thanks for the info. 
---
Strength can still be an important factor as far as fighting in Survival is concerned so I wouldn't rule it out completely by respec'ing. But, to each their ownüòÄ
---
Improve loot vs. time invested.  For example, you can find legendary creatures much more quickly than you can complete an event, even if the event spawns legendaries.  Also, make the plan reward rates weighted in favor of giving you something you don't already know.  Make the ammo rewards weighted in favor of weapons you're carrying and have in your stash.  Same goes for mods.
---
That *sobs* was beautiful
---
He‚Äôs the premier vendor for PA on PS4.
---
If you‚Äôre looking for Xbox, I‚Äôll humbly offer my services as well. 
---
Main menu, character. 
---
This is why I always go to one of the extreme sides or corners of the map such as Fissure site prime as it can then only teleport me closer to the centre of the map when I‚Äôm over-encumbered
---
I thought mods were pretty common? Plans are hard to come by but you can always buy mods from vendors.
---
Main menu select "character"
---
Ye with a mode for people to kill each other adventure mode has less griefers
---
Ever since Fo4 came out, my sniper character carries a backup knife specifically for mole rats. Even with all the compromises I make for weight reduction, one pound is dedicated to a knife just for dealing with mole rats. LOL
---
The PA frame should give 60 to Damage, Energy and Rad resistance and it should raise your Strength to 11 if you are below that level.  I find it useful just for the elimination of Fall damage.  No idea why you are getting less, have you tried reloading both with and without the PA on.  Open a ticket with Bethesda so it is in the queue when they read them on Feb 29th.

Unless this was recent, I have never seen nor hear of people finding them through treasure maps until now. If you can give more specifications on this, I would appreciate it.
---
I used to be able to pull 8+ from WS in a day with server hopping, now it seems like 1-2.
---
For me I know my gpu can handle it I got the Nvidia gtx 1070 ti which is still top of the line 
---
For Adventure mode. It's Definitely less for 3* drops. Over last 4 days I've probably killed 40 3* and only got about 8-10 3*. 
---
Unless RNG gods are butt  fucking me in the ass 
---
I love stories like this. I always go out of my way to help a new player. I had a similar thing happen to me when I started so I know how helpful it can be.
---
when I end up with a low level legendary weapon I look on the map for a new player and fast travel to them and just drop it for them to enjoy.
---
Keep up the good work fellow travellers of the wasteland 
---
Correct, there is also a set of the mask and robes in the Lucky Hole Mines secret room
---
i will not prove anything to noobs, bye mofo
---
yea. even after clicking on survival, on the next page it clearly says: "current rules". sounds like this will change in future updates for sure.
---
It can get you closer to a destination than your original location, getting you a discount. That‚Äôs really all I use it for.
---
You also have to keep in mind that they are trying to keep things balanced. I‚Äôm a rifle build and I can carry a decent Arsenal with me. They don‚Äôt want people carrying around there whole armory
---
Yes you can refill your stats at fifty I believe. I run a melee build as well ironclad maxed out, all the sluggers maxed out too. Only ever use pa when fighting scorchbeast queen. I can send you a photo of my perk card set up if you wanna get an idea 
---
I didn't notice and sometimes still don't as I lock pick all the time. Guess I zone out and go through the motions. 
---
When I run into those types of people I just serverhop.  I‚Äôd rather do that than let them ruin a good time
---
When I first saw the trailers for the game, I imagined a co-op style similar to Destiny. The only time I see that is on SBQ. Why there aren't more "boss" mobs I do not know. Some big behemoth or just other special large mobs that only a group can take out would be great. Picture a notification saying "oh no looks like (location) is under attack from a giant mole rat" people would respond. Let the server create some of this and less on the player to launch nukes
---
This got me on two occasions with different friends, we were so confused. Best bet is to log out when you‚Äôre not at the workshop and give up ownership. That REALLY needs to be fixed!
---
I thought they fixed damage to CAMPS? Bummer. :(
---
People keep destroying my generators now
---
Not when you're carrying over 50 Stimpaks, 30 Super Stimpaks, and 20 Radaway on you. 
---
I'm 29 and on Adderall what does that say about me? 
---
You may eventually get your refund, but that to may just be a simulation like the plastic simulation of the canvas bag.
---
Didn't they so the exact opposite of that? Increased the dmg so that shots penetrate armor better, but decreased fire rate to maintain dps balance?
---
Read my entire post. Every time somebody makes a thread on this topic it follows the pattern
---
1. I got suspended because I either did something wrong or did something that could be perceived as wrong. When can I get unsuspended?
---
2. YOU DESERVED TO GET BANNED AND STAY BANNED. I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT THE REF SAYS
---
3. Listen here buddy, I didn't do anything wrong. THAT'S MY PURSE, I DON'T KNOW YOU
---
4. I know Bethesda makes no mistakes and YOU SIR ARE A DUPER
---
5. Then occasionally someone adds a mostly fruitless update to the situation "Dur I got an e-mail a month later!"
---
OP gets negative karma while the white knights reap the rewards.
---
Sell them to a vendor bot and buy them back 
---
I love your thought
---
While I agree with you it's a total different debate.  
---
Killing people in video games is not the addiction alcholol gives and what the op talks about.  
---
Now about violent video games, well yeah, 99% of them are about killing people, and we all certainly approve, untill we stop buying them.
---
All the vendors are replaced by Wooby for the day.
---
100% agree. I played for a good 6 hrs yesterday and was able to take all the power plants the steel yard and the junkyard. No one was interested in PvP. I was able to build a lot and had a great time, met quite a few players who stopped in for the workbenches and resources. No one wanted to take it for just PvP. 
---
I‚Äôve found mine from savage divide maps. They are the rarest. I wasted around 400 maps to obtain 1-2 raider piece plans. As I‚Äôm a vendor I purchase a lot of maps from people I serve and use them periodically find new plans but I still miss 2-3 raider plans
---
What happens if you have no caps I wondered?
---
Sorry if I missed the explanation in your text, but where can you find PA mods plan? I know for xo1 and ultracite, I think you can find t60 in watoga , but where are the other one?  
---
On a side note :is it possible to craft a power armor who isn't x01 or ultracite? Your (very useful) post make me wish I could craft a raider PA. 
---
I agree we can do other challenges, and not having xx amount of atoms/day is not the end of the world.  
---
Nonetheless OP raised a fair point.
---
As people have with your comment ‚òπÔ∏è
---
That would be really OP. For instance disease cures are hard to make intentionally, if I can just go into my garden and pick them it would be much too easy
---
Yeah, that's what I thought it was, higher dmg, lower rpm
---
It looks like the cover art for a fantasy/horror novel. 
---
Gun bashing was pretty cool in 4 when it had "execution" or finisher animations, I'd use it much more in 76 if I could do that to scorched.
---
I suggested some new bosses while back. Didn‚Äôt really catch on.  
---
Hank and Bill: a massive two headed super mutant. So large that players need to team up and fly vertibirds to combat them. If you blow up your dead or hop le you have PA on and land for a ground fight. 
---
Twintail: a heavily pregnant queen radscorpion with two tails. 
---
Scorched beast royal queen: the true mother of the scorched beasts. Bigger faster stronger, and tough enough to resist explosions. 
---
Scorched beast royal king: same as above but can fly faster. 
---
Eh, it's more like having to drink fake beer to get points.
---
They will always be somewhere, so why not away from those who don‚Äôt want to be around it.  :-)
---
Me too. Someone built their camp on an existing house with a safe, I didn't even notice that there were two safes next to each other.
---
Nah it's fine tbh its the same as always. 
---
I don't see how a player hub would change anything. If there was enough need for it, players would have already figured it out. What do people want bethesda to really do?  Just make a free fast travel point? And maybe put the words "player hub" on the map?  I don't think it's a bad idea, I just don't see what's keeping people from just doing it. 
---
That person was, as I like to so eloquently put it... Talking out their arsehole
---
Interesting, I will have to look into that. I've obtained other rare Plans/Outfits such as all T-Series PA Part Plans, White Powder Sports jumpsuit, Vaul-tec Mechanic suit plan, VU Vault Suit Plan, Initiate BOS Paint, etc.. but this is a new one on me
---
Whenever someone posts 'I've finished the game. Now what?' I almost always suggest helping newbies. As you suggest a lot of materials we keep hoarding we end up dumping for more space later. I love shooting over to the Overseers camp and dropping a large set of melee weapons and 20-30 diluted stimpacks. Helping others rather than making the game difficult to enjoy is a worthwhile distraction between scorchbeast queen fights. 
---
What about insta weapon breakage?
---
I've been in the same place since beta because apparently nobody ever goes there. I usually get like a handful of dogs or level 10 scorched per week.
---
Right but with Survival, you don‚Äôt want to carry them. Hence the OP. 
---
OP having to stop questing these or not is another point. It is dodging in the way it is not ansering a fair point OP raised wich is about promoting addiction to alcohol in a game played by many kids.  
---
Some raised about killing people : I agree. But it's also a different pooint.   
---
While one can disagree with OP 'whining', one can also understand his reaction.  I totally understand his point that encuraging drinking is not a good thing.
---
We ARE out there. I waited a solid 20 mins for a dude to come out of the vault yesterday and he just stayed in there. And he'll never have any idea what he could have missed out on. :(
---
How do? I would think only if melee. 
---
Inspect it and scroll out. It has a model. And you're not alone, I've somehow got one too. Trying to trade or sell it makes its value 0, and then un-sellable
---
That would be great! Let us do more farming. Give us the planters, some robots for farming... weave it in with the Project Beanstock event lore.
---
I'm hoping to convince a friend to help me test me theory. I'll go to Point Pleasant and watch the bots while he heads to the forest relay tower and calls in a bot. If my theory holds I'll be able to follow the bot to Flatwoods, provided I can keep up, I've seen them fly pretty damn fast.
---
Lol not, What I find funny here is the many angry reactions from peopple .  
---
Op raised the point : how about promoting alcohol in a video game is bad.  Wich is a fair point, whatever  my opinion would be about it.
---
Tbh Incisor clears away so much armor that I'm not sure AA would be better. My Unarmed build puts an over repaired Gauntlet in the 350 damage zone. Checking values in awareness, the average player is going to have around 50 ballistic armor. I'm not sure going from 50 --&gt; 25 is going to result in an immediate 35 damage increase. They'd have to be wearing a lot of armor.
---
As it is, I think it's a wash. My first strike weapon is an Instigating Mole Miner's that ought to do 700 odd damage the first hit and usually wipes lesser players, even in their PA. Not sure how the new no one shot mechanics work with it but you're talking about a 2 hit death. My Assassin's Deathclaw also has +40% attack speed - doesn't seem like a lot but vs other melee players and/or multiple people you feel it. I'm going to have to do a lot of testing on people's corpses but if I can kill them in two hits and the only difference is speed of attack, I'll be using the Assassin's no matter what. 
---
Preston Garvey's ancestor gets added as the only human NPC.
---
Alright I‚Äôll give it a try 
---
That would be great. Did you just farm whitesprings and wendigo cave until higher levels? Trying to ensure I am farming as optimized as possible
---
I had this the other day.  Guy led a bunch of scorched to me, then constantly jumped in my face as I fought them off to make me hit him and trigger PvP, then stole everything I'd just spent 40 minutes scavenging.
---
But that amount gets reduced to 158 caps even with three ranks of hard bargain perked in. 
---
Ehhh. I'll be honest, it looks a bit like you just scrolled through the list of camp items and just randomly put them down all over
---
Rock out with you rocket out. 
---
You mean "Isn't this solved 54 days into the future after you originally wrote your post?" To that I would say maybe. We barely got that PvP mode. 
---
Your reply, like I shouldn't have said anything about this 54 days ago because they finally did something about it in the last week sometime isn't cool.
---
I moved to Watoga a while back. Plenty of water ways. Legendary robots, SB, builds to loot, Mirelurks in select locations. Plus your near the prime site for Queenie. There‚Äôs thunder mountain substation with a seeming always spawning deathclaw. Although it‚Äôs been wendigo, sloth, radscorpion a few times. 
---
Keep us apprised of your results. 
---
Only one usable and rest drop to ground, untouchable , at next login.  So you waste them.
---
You have to respawn at your C.A.M.P. or Vault 76, those are the only free ones but if you have the caps you would be able to respawn at the closest Train Station. So it's a little intense and there's like an exploration curve because you have to route things differently since you can't just jump around. You can also respawn at owned workbenches so that's incentive but it's hard to do while you're under attack
---
Stealth nerfs to fun gameplay?  Never Bethesda. 
---
I drove past an ice box the other day that looked exactly like the one in game and almost instinctively pulled over to see what was inside it
---
Didn‚Äôt really farm prior to this, just milked my time through the game since beta lol. Just recently I started to take over more workshops at a time and been joining a lot of events. 
---
Tremendous post. I wish there was a dedicated Firebreather faction mission set and extra faction gear that protects against fire, explosions and disease. The suit is sick but I can't abide that -2 PER for the helmet. 
---
T series BOS vendor in Watoga Shopping Center
---
Excavator: Camden park and Grafton robot vendors
---
Raider: Pleasant Valley Raider vendor 
---
Ultracite: drops from the queen
---
X-01: MIA
---
From what I hear we should be able to name our item soon.
---
I use it fast travel while over encumbered sometimes.
---
I assumed by their statement that they meant the perk was *always* useless, even in adventured.
---
Mole miners ftw.  Just mow me down and destroy everything they own.
---
boosting his ego. his K/D ratio for this life
---
pinch your nose and say that out loud
---
I like the radstorms where it‚Äôs perfectly sunny and you just randomly take rad damage. I think I‚Äôve seen one or two actual green storms since beta.
---
This is good. The flare needs more. And sending out a beacon is great. I used to carry one in beta to tell people where supply drops were. But people stopped coming when scum started using it to force pvp fights. 
---
Ah fair enough. 
---
Are u overencumbered?
---
Why would they know what works when it's there first ever unrestricted pvp fallout mode?
---
You should'nt have deleted mate, it was really good point. Don"t listen to the butthurt fanboys.
---
GLORY TO THE PLAGUEFATHER
---
You‚Äôre in first place, oh boy.
---
Ban this guy. 
---
Im dying for perk loadouts with hot keys, but 1/4 of your playtime hours being in the perk menu? If accurate, that's on YOU and can easily be remedied by not spending an hour in there. No scenario requires an hour of perk setup time, at least after you've read all the perks once.
---
That‚Äôs been fixed as well. 
---
Nuke Charleston. Pick up nuked bloodleaf
---
One shot kills + built in aimbot = that‚Äôs a no from me, dog. 
---
Yep... as a lvl 15 some high level destroyed my entire base..... can't wait on the day they change this cause I don't pvp 
---
Expect to spend literal weeks just vendor cycling to caps max daily so you can buy recipes and then build/destroy tons of these before even moving on to the real farm of ws ghoul hunting for the base legendary you want.
---
I still get migraines thinking about my ordeal.
---
yes all the aholes are gone
---
I hear tears. I smell butt hurt. This pleases me.
---
Those are good tip, thankyou.
---
Exactly, why is an optional mod WORSE than the original especially considering that the ammo is a lot less common too....  I can almost see putting the .38 on the combat rifle temporarily if you had a crap-ton of .38 to burn through.  But there is ZERO reason to ever mod a hunting rifle to .50
---
Oh wow, didn‚Äôt know you were working on that. Please let me now if I can contribute. 
---
Glad you‚Äôve liked it. you‚Äôre the man! 
---
That‚Äôs pretty smart too
---
It turns into Vintage Nukashine.
---
I saw on the map some high levels by the camp, is this what you all do?
---
Its been glorious‚Äînow, if only the servers were a *wee* bit more stable, I‚Äôd say 10/10
---
As is, solid 8/10.
---
I‚Äôm talking total time every time I have to switch not just one time 
---
Don‚Äôt exist, gotta find the hat 
---
LoL.  Left game months ago, it is still not implemented?
---
Is he going to ask us to nuke specific places?
---
Nice, yeah, it's stuff like that which will keep people playing and even join in spite of issues. 
---
PS4. Got my base attacked once, the night before survival mode released. 
---
Fast traveled back and the guy was TSE shotgunning everything inside. I dropped a turret in front of him as he was shooting and he killed himself. 
---
Laid there saying something for like 30 seconds, I couldn't hear him (late night, baby sleeping so low volume) so I just took off all my gear and started t-bagging him until he finally respawned somewhere. Then I logged out :)
---
I wish there were a more organized STASH, for sure. Like, I get it, it's all got to be in the main STASH for access at Train-stations and Vendors. But...if you could have the MAIN stash, and then sub stashes, like the Fermenter and Artillery, at your CAMP it'd be great. 
---
we're still talking about IN GAME right? ...
---
&gt; FULL of violet flux!
---
You had me at full of violet flux. Where do I sign up?
---
More likely duping item get deleted on server entry because duplicate I‚Äôd tags are now checked, aaaannnddd, you got a nice red flag on your account I bet.
---
I‚Äôm expecting it to be eerie but a lot of fun too!
---
It's coming 4/9
---
Not all. But hopefully enough to make it easier for low level players 
---
Nice
---
You prefer that over faschnacht mask with steel worker uniform and fire axe?
---
The quest in hornright in Charleston can give you a lever as a reward. Best place is to check responder vendor bots. Also supply crates can drop them as well
---
I don't think you can be any threat with missing your shots and doing only AoE damage from Explosive. Not when you are against someone with brain &amp; past level 50.
---
What?  Yes they do lol
---
There's a plan for the Confederate Hat,  Union Hat,  and the Top Hat.  I've found all 3 on the Civil War Reenactor.
---
I wouldn't mind playing survival mode were it not for the whole "losing 1/10th of my caps every time I die to literally anything, and also being hunted down for surviving a long time" thing. survival would be perfectly fine but they decided to make it go this awful, competitive route that just makes people act like total assholes anytime they can.
---
they seem to think that surviving for a long time should entitle you to a free haircut, when in reality, it leads to people purposely killing themselves before they hit the top 3.
---
I complained about the massage services many times and I'm starting to think it won't ever get fixed. I understand there's a 'no handy' policy but I know for a fact that there's a factory override and I don't see what the problem is. 
---
I took it the wrong way. sorry I understand now. thank you for commenting 
---
The decontamination chamber is a low blow. That's a bitch to grind for. I will prob store that when I leave my camp and have it hard enough to get to while I'm there. That I could go store it while they take out the rest of my camp. 
---
I could be sneaking, I have all Agility sneak peeks equipped and somehow my sneak goes immediately from hidden to Danger upon getting anywhere near a mole rat as they somehow know exactly where I am. I look around and they're nowhere to be seen or my VATS picks them up 50ft away. Then they magically appear at my feet.  It's the only enemy that immediately detects me sneaking. 
---
I have an extra; how much?
---
Shooting a few vertibird flares at their house while being completely hidden, then watching them through binoculars, recording the clip, then sending it as an xbox message. Creeper+10
---
Not with that place, but Site Bravo. Every time I entered it yesterday it kicked me all the out to my Home screen.
---
It‚Äôs faster to relieves a new character tbh.  Got old quick for me.
---
The only issue is Bethesda making us use crazy shit to transfer to our alts.  
---
So much risk. Hate them for this fact alone. 
---
It‚Äôs behind a locked door, I only open it when I‚Äôm in camp. As soon as people can‚Äôt destroy my base I can remove the lock from the door.
---
I took it the wrong way.  sorry I understand now. thank you for commenting 
---
I‚Äôd get annoyed that there aren‚Äôt holes in the walls to walk through irl. LOL
---
Agreed. We need more items if we are supposed to "help rebuild Appalachia"
---
I'm actually missing X/O switches 
---
And for Atoms sake, give us the ability to make our decon showers turn on/off automatically!
---
The real question is how hard can it be to realize they meant starred legendaries and then moving to achieve this rather than whining about what you wanted it to be instead?
---
I was actually thinking I needed to slow down and start questing and reading terminals to more engrossed in the story. I‚Äôm only level 30 so am not too far into it. I‚Äôm doing Rosie‚Äôs quests. 
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre pubescent at 29, but then I don‚Äôt know you personally. 
---
I really hope a fix for this by making the invulerability after spawning longer is fixed. I'm sure the community moderators are aware, but can someone tag one of them?
---
The crossbow was probably my favorite weapon leveling up through to 50 because when I got it, it hit hard and was completely silent unlike my noisy sniper rifles (that I couldn't yet silence). After a while the drop off was too much to sustain. 
---
I really wish there was an upgraded power bow or something that would be endgame useful. My AA Gauss is the best weapon I own but I'd trade it for sick crossbow. 
---
Thanks :)
---
My friend and I did this to a poor low level the other day. We would hide around in bushes with binoculars and watch them and occasionally do emotes then run off and wait for them again. However, we made up for it afterwards by dropping a bunch of blueprints and junk for him while completely naked then ran into the darkness. 
---
Pls explain WHY you have this problem with those who shut down valid criticisms. Not saying I think that's how it is, as I do not. BUT when an adult with a family and job types a novel on Reddit and says words out loud like " My problem is with the people who shut down any and all criticism for the game, zealously defending something that is really quite indefensible ", Id love to hear an actual honest reply as to why you have this strong, emotional response.
---
WHY does this bother you, when we have similair perspectives about the bugs yet it didnt even occur to me to worry about these other people's opinions? Help me understand why ANY adult would become impassioned, not about the bugs, but about what some other person does or thinks?
---
I'm on PC
---
I'm on PC but thanks for the offer :)
---
That‚Äôs an interesting take on survival.  I haven‚Äôt tried it yet, so im curious how it will be.
---
I did the same. Except the guy was sleeping in his bed. I said "hi nice base i just wanted to look around" he swore at me and procedeed to call me racial slurs so i blew his whole base up.... i tried to be nice. No place for racism when there only 24 people alive in alpachia
---
You realize people in the middle ages went to war with all kinds of farming implements, including scythes. Any tool with a sharp point or a blade can be a useful weapon, and has been used as such. Its all about knowing how to use the weapon properly.
---
Why would you keep trying to spawn in after the first time you got spawn killed?
---
People seem to skim past this point. I think quarterly seasons would be best. It's an interesting concept I cant wait to see how it plays out. 
---
Sure They're people? The AI's favorite target is your generator. One Supermutant with a rifle will plonk away at them all day if you're not careful.
---
I'm only level 30 something so it would be pretty good for me 
---
it spreads. 
---
Mahahaahahahahahah
---
but yes, i RWBYs
---
It was like 5 bowls of soup. Even though im always 1lb away from being overweight. I knew i had a free refill  on food/water when i became overencucumberd twas glorious.
---
Tbh I got rid of it a while ago to replace with Blocker. It was an adjustment at first and my bank suffered from the 100+ lbs worth I had to stash but keeping 20 or so on me I realized that I don't really use them all that much. Reducing it down to 5 for Survival and switching back to Adventure I don't really use them there either, the most I think I've used so far has been jumping off of cliffs and buildings repeatedly and needing to fix my broken legs. 
---
Another plus would be they sell for great caps. That stealthboy T-60 chassis ain't going to buy itself. 
---
thanx, but no.
---
Missing the point entirely there my friend. How else can they experiment on the play mode and get community feedback? 
---
You know the childish hate train died out months ago, you can fade away any time too. 
---
One to bout 35 is the golden zone, you make yourself visible enough, people will hand down loads of stuff they don't want to see go to waste &amp; it frees up space in the stash for better stuffs.
---
Sounds like this isn't the game for you.  You should take a break. 
---
There's already scythes on some of the barn walls. 
---
All we hear is wah wah wah. 
---
It's been about 1:20 for me. I just got the BOS Officer paint last night.
---
Sorry I‚Äôm on pc. Thanks for the offer..üôè
---
I guess you have a BETA personality then. 
---
Late reply but this is happening to me too, Xbox One.
---
Aluminum and lead
---
Two items! (insert laughter from the Count)
---
Yes, pygmy bat to be specific.  
---
I‚Äôm a fan of the potted plant super sledge mod you made. Very creative
---
Nah I dropped all the Armor before I left even some of the in-use armor, it took me over 2 hrs to find another left leg thanks for the tip tho
---
Ur late...but noted
---
I love it except for the power lines crossing a walkway!
---
And everyone I've met in that PA skin has been a douchebag but that is unrelated. 
---
I was attacked by 3 yao guais one time, and drank some for the same reason. Blacked out with one still at full health, and all my weapons broken. Would‚Äôve been a goner without it honestly.
---
No thats why its called under armour 
---
Absolutely tremendous post. Kudos. 
---
One minor quibble and one that I didn't know myself until I saw it myself - Ultracite PA mods also drop off of normal SBs. I believe only level 80. I was so thoroughly shocked when it happened I wasn't sure if it was real but I only own two Ultracite PA mods and 50% of them came from a regular NQ SB. I've never killed the SBQ so they built in a rare backdoor for dedicated hunters. 
---
I pay 25
---
I'm good after 600 hours and 215 levels. I don't PVP so I don't care what you spend to become a better PVP player.
---
I enjoy playing the game as if it were Fallout 4 and my character constantly evolves around the weapons and armor that drop for me not duped gear that someone else found. I can't imagine any fun in the game if you eliminate the RNG aspect of it and buy everything you want.
---
I like survival cause i can drop all my aid items and junk on a stash, pop a cranberry relish + well rested and get ridiculous xp bonuses on my second character. 
---
+1 perception. Only outfit that has a bonus, afaik.
---
I made a comment about this the other day, I have enjoyed adventure mode so much more. I love to go to other players offer plans that I already know, give low levels water stims Etc. I love inviting passers-by to come into my Camp to use my facilities and show them around. The game has been so much more enjoyable now that all the crazy people have gone off to shoot each other in survival it's awesome!
---
The first two times I used it, I spawned in the exact same place. 
---
Thanks. Sounds like I'll craft some more ammo and maybe get one or two levels and new skill cards and then give it a try. 
---
Looks like a cat with wings.
---
I'm guessing you have never heald an actual .50 bmg round, they are not nearly that heavy. As for the machine gun, a human couldent carry one and fire it at the same time. Honestly I never understood why people think that's so great an idea other than it looks cool. I was just talking about the rifles anyway, not heavy machine guns. If your going to go whole hog on concept instead of a little reality, then heavy machine guns would not even be in the game. I'm simply asking why the rifles cant weigh around 8 to 10 lbs at most instead of 8 to 20 lbs. I can carry 600 rounds of 5.56 in magazines on my chest, carry my rifle, in plate armor, with a backpack full of gear and still move around fine, run ect and my ar weighs in at around 7 lbs with the sight, laser, flashlight and sling. Amplify that to a video game and I dont think my marksman rifle should weigh 13 lbs as the picture of it shows a composite stock not a wood one. A dose of reality wouldent kill anyone and would make it easier to carry other items such as food and drink sense we have to use both every 5 minutes it seems. I hate having to constantly grind food and water just to go fight a blast zone or explore long. 
---
It happened to me at level 15 too. And I said.. fuck this Im respeccing and Im only killing people. 
---
Thanks a lot I appreciate your kind words. I‚Äôve heard it from numerous people that there is a chance. Thanks for the added value. I‚Äôll surely mention that in the next update.
---
The trading and rebuilding has become more of a priority I feel like.
---
Well that's totally counter intuitive to any MMOs formula.
---
I think they need to stop with these handheld modes. Right now Ark, Rust and games like it does the pvp mode way better... high reward high risk game play. 
---
I think if they disable perks it prevents the build from being shit when you die. Make the named legendary weapons harder to find if not remove them as well from the survival mode all together.
---
Allowing clans in the game all together to pool resources help newer players get a leg up in the world of surviving. 
---
Allow stashes to be raided allow for bigger battles and give some incentives for going after bigger clans . They have the receipe and the means just need to stop the hand holding  
---
Doesn't matter. I wouldn't risk broadcasting it.  Taking advantage of system glitches is the reason all those people got banned.
---
They have to be as my generators are impossible to attack unless you're looking to.  I always put them indoors.
---
Agreed, I think it‚Äôs good to hint at ideas like that, but to reveal things like that would be divisive. This way both general players and Tin foil hat wearers are happy! 
---
Ah ah ah
---
I have dropped 400 screws, 5k in various ammo, and other "valuable" things that can't be sold to vendors. May not be an every day occurrence, but not that unusual either.
---
It's Saturday Satan, give it a rest.
---
Fast travel cost for sure.  I only do events near my camp or V76 lol. 
---
These high level players are not ready for this level 8 guy with a lot of throwing knives to spare
---
I couldn't do that unless I had control of the vault. You don't know what or who is in there, or when or if it will emerge suddenly. 
---
Just imagine sleeping in your cozy little camp and *Brrrrr* you hear the vault door unseal and open. 
---
I always fix other's CAMPS. 
---
Anyone got a macro for looting bullets?
---
Sorry. Somehow this showed up in my feed when I was looking for something about flux. I didn't notice that it was old. 
---
Excavator is the only matched set at this point, right?  Maybe in the future they‚Äôll add perks for other matches sets.
---
Aren‚Äôt ghouls addicted to chems? 
---
Todd did say the fall update will really change the game.
---
Oh, damn. I used mine because I thought it was gonna spoil üò≠
---
One of my friends has built his camp in such a way.  That you have to go through 3 locked doors and a set of stairs to get into their home.
---
The armour perks are great, until you hop in to your power armour. I've got 3 pieces of armour that decrease weapon weight by 20% and 1 that decreases ammo weight by 20%. Which is great when I'm not in PA, as with my Furious GL, TSFatman, AGL, Minigun and tier 3 bear arms, all if them weigh less than a pound and with perk cards my average weight is 245 out of 310. I also carry a FE Handmade, Exec Lever Action, AA combat shotgun, furious combat rifle and a few other fun weapons. But once I'm in my PA, even with calibrated shocks in my T-60, I lose all those armour perks. It's be cool if the 3rd and 2nd perks on armour worked while in PA. 
---
I want to be a moo-moo
---
To be clear, I can't stand pvp griefers, and agree that if you're set passive, yous camo ought to be safe. 
---
Regardless of the timing, I'm glad that it's taken care of. 
---
Fair enough I suppose, I did try to make it look somewhat organised. I don't really plan on sticking around long anyways due to it's soon-to-be marked on the map status
---
Based on my experiences with my new characters, you can easily kill people higher level that you, I'm lvl 15 and my hunting rifle can kill people lvl 50+ in 2 or 3 shots, my double barrel shotgun in 2 or even one hit at close range with a vats crits, my 10mm pistol in about 10 or 8 shots. This game is somehow balance for low level people!!??
---
Yeah, I have the same problem. If you share one that is within your base charisma is stays, but if you share one that is using boosts from Herd Mentality, Magnetic Personally, or other boosts, it seems to drop off. It might be some weird bug related to Strange in Numbers, Class Freak, Herd Mentality, Magnetic Personality, or others. I haven't tested it yet but it is an annoying bug. u/Aten_Ra another one for the unofficial bug list.
---
Yeah that blows. I'm at least glad that on the PC version you have to add people as friends before you can join them, so you can see that campfire to let you know where they are.
---
Sigh, for the people going ape shit over this post, I said nothing about ammo weights, or that everything should suddenly be the exact weight it is in reality. None of us would be carrying a .50 machine gun or mini gun if that were the case or large amounts of ammo. I simply would like to carry a wider variety of rifles and the weights being better would help that happen. I use certain weapons for certain purposes. Distance shots require a .308 or .50 and if done correctly dont require a ton of ammo, up close semi auto requires more ammo. Sometimes a silenced combat rifle or handmade ( ak ). I have built different models with different mods for different purposes and missions. I'd simply like to not have to go back to a stash box constantly to trade out when I could carry more than two options
---
Then you're fine, I dont mind that.
---
Adventure is cleaned up for sure... but survival mode to play the game is ruined by spawn sniping jerks.  I am grinding for levels right now so i like the extra xp but getting into a pissing contest with low levels with guns they clearly didnt earn... farming me for caps is a nightmare when all im there for is the game.. usually. My pvp is weak. Lol
---
I agree, and I'm honest, I don't exploit the game I use the mechanics that they give me. Yeh it sucks but there are ways around getting robbed and not inviting Pvp to your doorstep, since release everyone had been aware of "my kind" yet they still bitch and moan when it happens. Go and get 10,000 signatures on a petition and down vote me but I'm right. I haven't exploited the game, I used the tools I've been given, and as I said I'm honest but yet I'm a nob for doing what the game intended.... Surprised no one has called me a griefer yet to be honest.
---
Also I jump back to adventure mode and I give stims out for free, radaway, radx, serums, stealth boys to the nearest players. I let them have to 500 cap bounty plus all junk I have... Yet I'm an arse hole. My karma speaks for itself and there are hundreds of players I've helped, I give my plans away, unless they're super rare, and the ammo I don't use.
---
In a 4 hour period I probably give away 1000lbs of stuff, good stuff to. All because I'm not a greedy bastard and I like to help out.
---
2 guys today, I jumped back to adventure mode, not to store my stash of aids, junk, etc... To give away, I admit people are skeptical when I wave the follow emote but once they trust they gain. Ask around. I kill campers to, a lower level today got camped soawned, capped out and lost all his aid items, I helped him, sent him a team request, then went on to tell him to go to my base then I returned more than he lost.... Using mechanics the game has given me. 
---
I had this happen way back, turned out not to be a bug but instead because my CHARISMA dropped a point from hidden addicition. Popped an addictol and magically could share it again, worth a test!
---
Three AHs, ah ah ah
---
They have overlooked it to date.  
---
It's been reported multiple times, the problems appears to stem from a cut set of perks that were for exotic weapons.   
---
Railway Rifle should of course be a heavy weapon, without a special sub-category, and currently it also does very poor damage, considering the weight of the projectiles and the weapon itself.
---
I bluffed the fuck out of a higher level that was griefing someone's camp the other day. I love exploring camps when I come across them, so I was poking around in one, and I heard shooting so I went up to the roof and some dude was shooting at this camp. It was a sad little camp, barely anything at all. I did the "unhappy face" emote and the "finger guns" emote and then stood there. I'm just over level 100, but I'm wearing my Quantam PA and I think the guy thought I was a lot tougher than I actually am, and he stopped firing at the camp, and after wandering around a bit took off. 
---
More proof we're in a simulation.
---
It would be cool to be ghoul or super mutant, like an irreversible change.
---
Todd Howards ultimate revenge.  Fallout 76 players wake up to "Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to nuke the prime site right? Walked right into that scorched ambush, same as us, and that
---
synth over there."
---
No you need 2nd Microsoft account and add that to your family on the main account. That will share all games and xbox live.
---
Sounds like an idea. However, I'm not too keen on totally changing my SPECIAL stats, seeing how I probably won't do too many runs.
---
Currently running this build: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=aa86b65&amp;d=sb2s61s01sa2pa0p80p90pd0pk0pl0pp2p00ee2ej3c72c30cr0i30ia0i50ic4s12a72a41a80lt2l91&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=
---
Happy Camper will go anyway, no idea why I picked that. I tend to add 1 Perception, seeing how I could use that for an allround build and I might use it as well to add a rank in one of the rifleman perks.
---
I could also throw out all non-combat related stuff and add some points in all rifleman perks, which would just take a bit of time to get the necessary cards (6 levels to get them all to 3*, 3 more to also have a 1* copy). Would need 10 levels in total including the point change form Charisma to Perception. I guess that might help quite a bit, but I#m afraid I'm too impatient to wait that long :D
---
I‚Äôm interested, but I don‚Äôt see a link with more info. Could you put one up?
---
That‚Äôs rad
---
Be right there thanks 
---
Just had this today.... so lame...
---
Known issue :(  
---
Causes can include:   
---
-Leveling up and receiving a perk pack.  
---
-Fluctuating Charism.  
---
-"Ghost Party Member" from a CTD/BlueScreen.  
---
-Someone leaving the party.   
---
-the game deciding it doesn't like you today.    
---
Stash limit changed to the infinity symbol but still only holds 800. 
---
I have a marsupial.  GT mrduffany
---
A suoressed maxed out auto combat rifle
---
Is nice.  
---
And I sold a 2‚ú® full set marine Bolstering armor today for 4k, I know I could of got more, I asked for more.
---
He was low level and said he couldn't afford what I was asking, he said 4k? I said yeh, because yeh I'm a dick, but Im a helpful dick.
---
Will send a message rn
---
I figured, was hoping it was b/c I‚Äôm tired of adding to the list of bugs that just seem to b in my beta character 
---
Well i mean look at all the guns you got i think it's fair to keep the balance it's one thing to be a tank another to be a warship.
---
Right. Unless they bring legendary paints or armor pieces it‚Äôs likely that it wouldn‚Äôt matter 
---
I don't want to say Zetans. But Zetans.
---
Is Harpers Ferry really just such a small town? I thought Bethesda made it smaller because of game limitations.
---
Yep. I think carry weight woukld be helpful, without creating an obvious competitive imbalance. 
---
Could always try a different photo spot? There isn't only 5 to choose from
---
Per multiple players dedicated testing, no. 
---
I'll double check the ESM to see if they stealth fixed it, but it literally had the wrong effect linked to the OMOD.
---
Adderall sucks.....cocaine is better üòé
---
I'm game
---
Where can I find the dedicated testing?
---
Railway rifle should get benefits from the CAMP cards. Both the cards that make your camp cheaper to build (use less ammo? Nails and rifle weigh less?) and the damage to camp cards (+10-20% per rank).   
---
It'ed be funny as hell. 
---
Totally agree that it is in need of a boost.
---
Most of my game is spent as a lone wonder, so this would be great!
---
Survival mode is a great time. I love it. I wish we could build or structures twice as tall.
---
What platform?
---
I have a 1* Bloodied Gatling Gun on XB1 for sale 
---
Depends on how you define success. There are perk loadout planners you might want to check out. I've never used them, but lots have and they're great ways to plan a character to be stronger later. 
---
Scrap everything. I know you think you want to sell weapons, but getting 3 caps wont make up for the lost mod plans you learn when you scrap. Armor rewards fewer mod plans when you scrap it, so you have to scrap even more of those. I save chems to sell to vendors instead of weapons/armor. 
---
If you find a vendor that isn't in a trainstation, check google to see if it's a rare, and if it is, tell everyone on Reddit what server you're on and hold it for people, they'll love you forever. 
---
Events are good early on for learning plans. Workshops, too. Workshops will put you into PvP, though, so make sure you scrap and store your junk often. Heck, just scrap and store junk often no matter what, cause it's the only thing that drops when you die. You can go back and get it, but if a high level is camping your bag, it might not be worth it. 
---
It's a good idea to loot EVERYTHING. Screws, plastic, lead, etc will be your best friends for a long time. 
---
If you're getting greifed, just hop servers. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, the person can keep killing you forever, and you'll lose all your caps.
---
That being said, some people are super nice and will give you gifts for no reason other than they want to. So don't think everyone walking towards you is going to kill you...presuming you're not on the Survival servers lol. 
---
Huh? The challenge requires you to get five photos at five specific cemeteries - Kanawha being one of them. But it‚Äôs a big area and it‚Äôs m incredubly fussy about where you‚Äôre standing. This is the only area where I could get the challenge to register as completed.
---
Cheesecake is perfect....you take that negativity back right meow!
---
There isn't much impact to the story in the game anyway.
---
Bethesda won't do that because they wanna sell stuff through the Atomic Shop.
---
Beavers, frogs, and squirrels become high level killing machines.
---
joining
---
Maybe its just more likely that only older folk can afford a pc capable of running the game whereas most kids do own a console.  Pure speculation though.
---
30 luck 3 really good items in 300 levels, luck only affects durability on the itmes dropped
---
This is a great idea!  Part of the rebuilding and player freedom that Bethesda was hoping for!
---
Uh, I think there's a blueprint. I think I have that blueprint. I'll check, and if I'm right and if you're on PC I can toss you a set. 
---
Hahah, yes, that'd be great. 
---
I like it now knowing that other people cant slap damage kill me anymore.
---
I assume op means something closer to the grim reaper's and not a farm one? I am all for this and more twohanders that will make the game wondefully closer to being Elder Scrolls Fallrim 76.
---
Probably lol didn‚Äôt reference
---
People aren't running around looking to kill you or destroy camp
---
You can find tarberries in the stream around watoga and all over the bog.
---
Well then
---
I agree... I don't worry so much about carrying junk around when on a trade run, random invites from people I don't know, or strangers wandering around my Camp. 
---
However, I was against Survival mode as it is, but I actually like it now, but more for the gamble that it presents. You go in with what you are willing to lose, and an idea about how many Caps you want to risk, kill some high level player and make bank, or die and cut your loses by heading back to Adventure Mode to start to cycle again. 
---
Why are you still here? 
---
Mole rats, other animals and even scorched can spawn inside your base just so they can get to your generator. They really don't like generators lol.
---
I can come and visit.
---
I'm hopeful that this actually works for power armor. 
---
I'd give you that for some, but put all together, I think its a simulation. Not that there's anything wrong with that, we can be trapped in the game forever or maybe  "break out" someday and start a new storyline. like you say its a video game, not a reality simulator.
---
Awesome idea, and coding is likely written already from FO4. Ill upvote this!
---
 Why are immortal people thing in pvp game?   
---
Some people scared of getting hurt.
---
I have been attacked so few times.  At level 150+ I have only ever been greifed one time really.
---
The forums and reddit have been fairly negative for a long time, all that internet anonymity creates people who speak often without caring of the results of what they say.....no accountability. 
---
It's like the downvotes on reddit, often they end up high simply because people can just downvote anything they disagree with...then others bandwagon and follow like sheep.
---
People are weird as a whole lol.
---
I had an experience a few days ago with someone who dropped a bag with mushroom soup so I used the puke emote and dropped a bag with Sugar Bombs, then he hearted. No voice at all. We both for sure take some laughs.
---
Nah I'm on Xbox. Thanks tho.
---
Nothing better than hide inside White Springs or Bunker with a chameleon armor and watch the chaos :3
---
Pro tip: Bring canned food and water
---
Can rejoin server multiple times to refresh his inventory 
---
The Division 2 has a normalization system for pvp that makes fighting others feel way better.  You still get the effect of a strong build, but even undergeared lower players can own you.
---
U can also make carrot nectar from carrot flowers or carrot soup which lasts 30mins
---
That you have adult ADHD most likely lol :)
---
Ikr?  You can't reason with this guy.  He's the same guy who doesn't want bloodied to stack with adrenal reaction. 
---
I started using gauss rifles and finding this issue happens the first time I fire something even with 95% hit chance. I'm usually pre-charged, acquire a target to let loose either manually or via Gun Fu, and the first round misses pretty much every time. Really annoying. Bethesda really need to fix it, particularly if it's been in the engine since FO4.
---
Hah!  Love that idea, since I‚Äôm specked for rifles and (like the gauss) it has Rifle in its name despite being heavy like the gauss, fingers Xed that try add it to the Rifle tree 
---
Anyone know if it has inherently more limb dmg the way it did in FO4?
---
That's interesting, cause I've found the servers to be better lately. I've had only like 3 server drops. I was on a server for like 6 whole hours day before yesterday, I was on so long I actually got a "This server is going to be shut down for maintenance" message, and that's the only time that's ever happened. 
---
Does the welded rebar plan for ultracite only drop from the queen?
---
This is actually super impressive 
---
&gt;  The total impact was that it takes longer to level up, your armor deteriorates quicker, so you spend more time farming and repairing, and creatures take allot longer to kill and become bullet sponges which then require you to farm/make more ammo.
---
i said this before all i got was downvotes getting called names and other nasty stuff
---
whitesprings xp nerf TSE nerf whiteknight nerf things only the reddit crybabies asked  for and now we have craftammo76 with a side dish of repairs its sad really
---
&gt;I have NEVER seen this again or any of my friends that still play since the nerfs.
---
preach it brother same here on pc,little to no nuke activity due to scorchbeast queen taking now taking 2x the ammo it used to pre TSE nerf + other bulletsponges in the fight like mirelurk queen and what not 
---
people don't like having their gear literally shat on and i can't blame them if they spent quite some decent time to trade for high end gear only for it to be worthless in a patch cause muh tse is op
---
now tse is nerfed and people quit hope they are happy with the results lol
---
Downvoted why lol....wth with reddit nowadays I swear.
---
My favorite place in the game
---
Agreed. Lone wanderer here who has loads of team play cards from card packs but only 1 solo specific card.
---
Great idea!  I feel dumb for not thinking of that.
---
Yes, there‚Äôs a different tone in there now. 
---
During the quest Wasted on Nukashine I drank it and it put me within walking distance of Watoga. As a lvl 17 Being in the cranberry bog while overencumbered is such not a good idea.
---
The next time I drank it it put me in a perch overlooking the toxic valley near Grafton.
---
You're right. I had the same issue trying to take photos in this cemetery but there are more than 5 to choose from. You can click in to the task and scroll through ~10 locations.    
---
Don't get me wrong, your advice is greatly appreciated for that Cemetery, most people don't know that there are more than 5 to pick from though, there is a whole list so if you're having trouble getting a photo at one of them, there are many others to choose from
---
Kill on sight, brah
---
There are definitely some things that need fixed. I think only the most troll-y people with argue with you that it's perfect the way it is. The only way they'll ever fix anything is to be the "squeaky wheel". 
---
I honestly think it's so much better now than it was when I got it, a few days after launch. I used to not even be able to craft or repair my weapons for HOURS.  Now I can do that any time I want. 
---
I do still have server issues with the SBQ, I swear every single time I even try the game locks up and it looks like I'm doing damage but she's actually been dead for 5 minutes and the server is just so lagged out no one can tell. And then if she does die, I get disconnected so I can't even get event loot. POOP I SAY.
---
Checking every now and then if its worth to play again. Run out of content 
---
Whitespring nuke zones have been so boring..I guess I'll start focusing more on SBQ
---
"I don't like what somebody did to me, so I'm going to do the same thing to everybody else."    
---
    
---
#that's the spirit!
---
It's like this: I had a PVP encounter in survival today.  I was wearing power armor.  The guy who attacked us wasn't wearing power armor. I killed him. He re-spawned and managed to kill me. I re-spawned and killed him again. That has been the entire PVP experience in a nutshell. It's  a simple matter of who can hit the other person first. Every type of armor that I have encountered melts with hit with the right weapon. 
---
is the plasma gatling viable now?
---
Great guide and I want to bring up something about Welded rebar . I use the the ultracite armor almost exclusively now has become one of my favs mainly because of welded rebar reflecting melee damage. I have heard conflicting damage results though ? Some guides (wiki) say 10% reflective but I think it‚Äôs more like 50% my combat experiences corroborate my findings . During one of the masks event  , I was being attacked by a griefer running unyielding assassin and he kept killing himself when he punched me , now granted I lost almost half my health during the hit but he kept dying over and over or lost enough damage that I could easily blast him  with my AAE shotty and finish him off . He kept messaging me after asking me what I was doing to counter his attack  !!! So I‚Äôm guessing it does way more than 10% validating your findings  except that you do take damage . At white springs in conjunction with my mutations (elec. charged ,unstable isotope )I just let the ghouls hit me and they die repeatedly lmao!! Great post and thank you for all the info on the builds !!!
---
Believe you are more likely to get it if you fully repair. Best help I can give since im on XBox
---
Calm down Satan.
---
Persistence... 
---
And going that other people spawning in would up my chances... Focus on them and not me maybe
---
Definitely like I realize they turn pvp restrictions off but some people are just total twats like I simply be trying to do the weekly for the free legendary and you get some douche wagons who come along and just constantly kill you and it‚Äôs frustrating 
---
I'm Surprised nobody else mentioned that drops are based on Charisma, cause I've been rocking 28 charisma without unyeilding while im in team and i've found two shots, exploding, senitels, calvaliers..  meanwhile my other toon with his 5 charisma has found only nominal garbage in his entire run up to 100+
---
In the same amount of time or so on PS4 been greifed only once I can actually recall.
---
Very rarely do players grief,  I have lost far more junk to unstable servers that kick me during a SBQ fight then I have to PVP.
---
Even if you lose your junk it's so easy to farm more quite quickly, especially if you keep any hard to find resources in the stash like you should.
---
I do the ash heap, lots of secluded towns
---
It is still happening.
---
Then similar to the creation club we could publish them to the atom shop and make a little bit of money or atoms in exchange 
---
Well colour me surprised!
---
That list is scrollable?
---
Thank you, I certainly didn‚Äôt know there were more to choose from! All that time wasted grid searching üòñ
---
You're right I think.. playing the game is "play to win" now ü§¶ü§¶
---
Lone wanderer is already powerful for single players, it doesn't need a buff. Now if Bethesda added more perks that give single players buffs, that's fine (like increases carry weight by 25, 50, 75 if you're traveling alone), but LW is arguably one of the best charisma perks already.
---
Well yeah i know that lol its just i cant seem to complete it lately cause the game crashes everytime im about to finish. Its frustrating to keep wasting my time on this event thats so long to have it crash and then ig2et zero rewards lol 
---
Thank you though!
---
If you can find one, it's definitely worth it. I have a lvl 45 legendary I picked up and I can solo scorchbeasts and their scorched hordes with it. I'm only lvl 49. It's heavy but it's worth it. 
---
How can I tell what server I am on?
---
Me too
---
This, man... It's crazy how much the same it is but how many people have convinced themselves otherwise. 
---
But, was the stalker wearing anything? It gets much creepier if they aren‚Äôt. 
---
Maybe more like an exhibitionist voyeur?
---
Even as a lvl 43, I love helping the new players that come out of the vault. I try and give a variety of weapons, armor, junk, aid and ammo too.
---
Nice idea! I saw a Firebreathers corpse in a nearby quarry and got excited, but the uniform can‚Äôt be looted. (I can‚Äôt use the machine at Belching Betty anymore either!) 
---
Same, haven't played much as I am still waiting for some more improvements and content,  but my very large hard to miss camp has only ever been destroyed once.  If anyone sees me online tho all my resources are unlocked and I give free Blueprints and stuff to anyone who drops by, H3adshotfox77 on PS4.
---
There's also deep pocketed that grants +10 carry weight. 
---
True but I feel I haven't see near as many guys running in front of my bullets or smashing my camp like a prick, this was my opinion.
---
It‚Äôs a 20% reduction in damage And ap reg and you think it needs a buff?... if you need carry weight there‚Äôs already Strong Back and a half a dozen equipment specific perks. 
---
Damn, been a while since we played last so was going to join but I worked it out as midnight / 1am here in UK and I have work in the morning :(
---
I dont know why, but it seems this week that Ive read tons of great new ideas, that after reading the same ones repeated over and over again for months. Have my upvote and know that you have converted many!
---
You can play Survival early twilight like 2am and have the longest life of like 3 - 5 hours. 
---
There is 10% chance for it to trigger, if it trigger it reflects back all the damage. I tested this on Yao Guais and Deathclaws and when it triggered their health decreased by 15/20 percent. 
---
Only way to keep addictions is to keep taking the same chems every time the addiction wears off as far as I know 
---
Or all vendor bots become Preston Garvey for the day. 
---
If no-one can help you can buy the plan from the production area in the Enclave bunker, can‚Äôt remember the price but you could keep it in mind as a back up plan
---
? but this game is already a joke. Why wait till April 1st?
---
A lot of the people who enjoy griefing others would prefer to seek them out on normal servers.....they enjoy griefing the non greifers, instead of going after their own kind lol
---
But it's not fallout 4 mate.. have fun being always right . Argue with yourself in future üëå
---
Yeah I have 2 concentrated fire perk cards. Wish there was some kind of reroll system where you can put your unused perk cards into a machine and it spit our new different ones.
---
The  "is sole survivor a synth??" theories made always made me groan, but these simulation theories are just a bigger doozy. Yeesh.
---
üòà
---
Well yeah, I‚Äôve gotten 2 over the last week and a bit. It‚Äôs not a lot you are right. But before that I was getting none.
---
TIL there are shops across from the hospital 
---
All enemies become randy the macho man savage.  Drops toy trains only.
---
Ahhhh so 10% to reflect all damage back !!! Nnniiiiiiccceeeee!!! Lmao that‚Äôs even better !!!
---
Do you still have him?
---
Just happened again. This time picking up an issue of guns and ammo #1. I do have an ultra widescreen monitor. and I've tried playing on both border and not. It's been like this since the patch that happened before they did the limited event with the masks. It's happens as I finish picking the lock, sometime while I am picking it, rumble kicks on the controller and stays locked on for a few seconds while the music does this little jump and then cuts out entirely. It's not a freeze it's a hard crash to desktop. I can't go to the queen fights at all because of the freeze in place thing. That's been since beta. 
---
It feels a lot more fun now that most of the griefers seem to have gone over survival mode.  I feel like I can actually walk around and not have to worry that the next player that comes up to me is going to try and kill me.  I have nothing against PvP but it's not my thing.  I just want to play, chill, and explore.
---
I can't join you 
---
that's beautiful my man, I love it!
---
I feel like I use VATS that much, but for melee, and i don't think i feel the drain reported, but I assume there is some other variable in there. 
---
So.. 
---
I noticed my excavator PA takes little dmg, ME while wearing excavator, on their hand.. lolz takes a lot.
---
What do you think could improve the 10% chance ?? 
---
Yep, this is where I got mine, multiple times.
---
&gt;T51b &gt; Ultracite &gt; X01 &gt; T60 &gt; T45 ‚â• Raider &gt; Excavator
---
its actually X01=T-51b&gt;the rest 
---
X01 is better for scorchbeast queen due to scorchbeast attacks being energy damage and the increased radiation resistance is actually noticeable compared to t-51b especially if you use a adrenal reaction/nerd rage/ build like me 
---
X01 is better for nuke zones
---
T-51b is better for the rest 
---
rest of power armor have meh stats
---
They are, and getting you to ragequit is often their goal, that's what makes them feel like they have won.
---
They want none of your resources, they are usually aholes simply wanting to kill your gaming session.
---
Granted I have greifed people before, but it's always been after someone has tried to grief me and I flip the tables and stalk them till they server hop.
---
Totally agree!! So many nice wanderers out there wishing to help others!!
---
No not really   Survival mode opened up, the assholes tried  it out for a while, then realized that it's not fun playing in a server full  of people who are just like them. 
---
So it's back to terrorizing workshops in adventure mode.   
---
It's why I've said and continue to say ALL pvp should be in survival mode.  Want that ammo factory and it is taken? Find another server. 
---
If you have the acid (and excavator power armor set), there are so many aluminum nodes in the hills just ESE of Whitespring Train station (along with copper).
---
Also, remember the beautiful sound of wind chimes means aluminum. :)
---
Exactly! I don‚Äôt know the percentage of the damage reflected, but I think it reflects 100% of the damage back. I‚Äôll do some more tests on PvP and will surely let you know.
---
They could but it won‚Äôt make much of a difference. You stand on the roof of a trainstation with a rifle you‚Äôre pretty much gonna catch anyone who spawns in, no matter where. 
---
I don‚Äôt have a link to anything but I can answer any questions you have 
---
Yea fully modded. But the picture doesnt show a standard reciever in the ad for the bundle
---
Nice! I‚Äôm oo_Nym_oo in game 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a cool idea haha 
---
Id help you but im not gonna be online for a couple of days but here is my experience. 
---
I did Poseidon atleast 5 times but never got the regular generator plans. I did thunder mountain 2 times but only wind mills. I did Monongah last and 1 time and it gave me fusion plans. 
---
I run a similar setup, I've had enemies literally brush by me and not find me. Instigating  sniper rifle+suppressor is amazing. If that doesn't kill them, it knocks them down enough to use my executioner's lever action. 
---
I sold mine, 4 shot dragon.. too freakin long to reload.
---
While it would indeed be nice and cool to have it as a player hub, free travel to that close to the center of the map would much lessen a needed money sink. Caps need to leave the economy, otherwise the amount of caps circulating would just increase, decreasing their value and increasing prices in the upcoming player vending. Unfortunately, no matter how much it sucks, money sinks are needed to keep any online game economy working. We don't have that many, travel and the reduced amount of money going back into vendors after a buy are the major ones. 
---
However, other forms of encouragement to make it a player hub would be nice. Direct travel to the shops (with cost), adding more food to the restaurants so you can get a nice choice of food buffs there before going out adventuring. Adding the ability to rent rooms as a home away from camp with small instanced rooms with limited furniture options.  Opening a "auction house" in the baggage claim area. Etc, etc...
---
Sweet joining you in a minute
---
Well, for one thing, this group of yours is it a mercenary team? Or a police force thing. And how do you communicate, are there requirements? Tests? Just to name a few.
---
It‚Äôs oo_Nym_oo - I‚Äôm mainly around on the weekends.
---
You make a valid point, but right now it seems like they are focusing on establishing their dominance in survival mode.  Also they can fried the helpless people at the spawn points.
---
Go to a high level enemy area? Join survival for the extra xp.
---
I'm waiting for the sole survivor. (I think the challenge will be kill tot. People)
---
Wouldn't be this way if Bethesda had taken some damn advice about how to make it better before throwing it out.
---
Do you think that Doritos would release new tortilla chips flavored "gummibears and garlic", slap a big sticker "Beta" on it and then wonder why people start asking questions like: "What the hell is going on?!" or "Did someone at Doritos actually test this??" or "Is this really what we've been asking for?" or "Aren't there a million other things they could have done instead?"...?
---
Yeah and it was a government experiment. There‚Äôs holotapes somewhere... wish I could remember where, I want to go back and hear just what they say again. 
---
Rebuilding West Virginia one iguana stick at a time.  :-)
---
If he had made a fair point, I would have addressed it. He didn't. Also, why are kids playing this game? Seems to me, as a parent, that their parents bear the responsibility of keeping them from being exposed to the mature themes in the game. My 9-year-old doesn't play, for instance. The OP is upset because he apparently didn't pay attention in AA to the whole "if something is a problem, walk away" thing. Instead, he wants everyone else to tiptoe around his issues. This is not a legitimate point.
---
A LEGITIMATE point would be that the frequency of alcohol-based dailies and weeklies is grating and the game would benefit if they mixed it up some. Not "I'm an alcoholic, so stop offering me these optional challenges I could completely avoid if I wanted."
---
I'm down. Haven't launched a nuke before even though I'm level 89. 
---
Go to the mothman museum area in point pleasant, collect the mothman eggs off the floor and cook omelettes with them. Sell them to vendors and you‚Äôll make at least 2-300 caps
---
I've used it a few times to get out of really nasty situations.  It's a gamble but so far it hasn't let me down.  I've got 5-6 on me right now as my last ditch escape plan just in case it sends me somewhere worse then where I was.
---
I had one guy scare the crap outta me after I took a base, but I got on the mic and told him I got the base for one thing and then he told me he just wanted to test his new gun. We did a little battle, but teamed up afterwards and got our stuffs. I haven't seen this kind of play before the PvP servers opened and it's really nice. 
---
To help,next time you think that is what someone is doing,  just force quit the game (on PS4 I just hit home then quit).  You go off the server without giving them the satisfaction of killing you.
---
This isnt always possible I know, but it helps a lot if you have someone griefing you.
---
After this game's release you are going to pull this BETA shit on us? Really?
---
Join on Nesbitt121. He had to relog.
---
Same for me.....oh wait my server is real life and covered with people....this sucks :(
---
The birds in my state are just starting to come back as winter is finally over, so yesterday i hear a faint chirp that sounded like a scorched officer, i looked around and the reality hit me that i wasn't gaming.
---
Spawn elsewhere steathboy mk3 chameleon. One shot kill the spawn killing jerkoff üëçüèª it‚Äôs my daily grind lol 
---
That doesn't mean much. I've found scorched on top of my house where my generator is on a few occasions. Unless they have marsupial also, the only explanation is they spawned there.
---
This, same thing I suggested to someone else, just server jump and remove their pleasure.
---
yes?
---
Well we are a group dedicated to protecting people against more evil people. It‚Äôs kind of like a police force (more like the minutemen from fallout 4) but we do contract work on the side for funding. We have a Xbox club and I am going to make a discord soon. Anyone can join at the moment as long as they are not a raider. The only position we have open right now is solider but I am looking to recruiting traders 
---
A little danger is still needed to keep the game interesting.
---
There isn‚Äôt much in the game that I fear....  so a little violence from players is still appropriate 
---
If you check the teaser for Wild Appalachia again you will notice that the place in the teaser has the Arktos Pharma logo on some of the walls. Vault raid might be coming later, but the first underground we will be getting is most likely the secret labs under Arktos Pharma. 
---
thats the only one in the base game to begin with 
---
They already got tons of good suggestions and ignored pretty much all of them and put in a weird leaderboard no one asked for.
---
I was happy with 400lbs stash. New generations are too weak to live in this cruel world.
---
Grab a teammate and it‚Äôs not so bad. You don‚Äôt need duped explosive weapons or sentinel armor to start taking players down. 
---
Crafting 50 cal nets 100 rounds in one go, 180 with max ammosmith and possible 280 with super duper. It also weighs less than .308 iir. 
---
congrats on invalidating all of your previous posts so efficiently.
---
Depending on your level I found the best way to go to fort defiance, loads of straight jackets probably about 10 per run ish they sell for 46 each. And also loads of Chems like psycho which sell for like 8ish, if you have the perk that lets you search for extra chems you also come out with loads of stims 
---
Was kicked but getting back in with someone there 
---
Your the man I‚Äôm looking for then :) PM me
---
I prefer propane.......and propane accessories.
---
I play around an hour a night during the week and more on weekends. What‚Äôs your time zone? Mine is British
---
I‚Äôd be glad to join, however I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm a ps4 player. I don‚Äôt grief and tend to help player that are below my level. I can be a part of a ps4 branch, but other than that this is my current situation.
---
There are tame dogs in the game look harder lol. Harper‚Äôs ferry is the best hint I‚Äôm giving ...not in the town but close and look up for the answer 
---
More than one. They only got rid of stacked items. So if you had 10 of the same duped guns and they weren't stacked, you'd still have all 10.
---
I do the same. I look into and see what it is. If the paper bag is near a vendor, its probably someone who couldn't sell anymore and needed the space. I find these bags on nearly every playthough in whitesprings resort in Friedrich's store.
---
Furthermore I drop everything I don't want in a paper bag in the church in Flatwoods. Hopefully some new players (or any player) finds it and is able to use the loot.
---
It is possible to pick it up, which is what happened. You picked up a particle of the explosion object(not the projectile itself); these are lootable, but do not have an activation text to show (like "Take"). If you want more of them, watch the "explosions" that result from various creature attacks, and spam E on where the particles appear to have fallen.
---
Come join us
---
Sure when you enter the enclave bunker and open the door with the ID card just follow the wall on your left hand side walk down the ramp and you will see the safe. Keep in mind this is outside of the vault door.
---
This gets frustrating sometimes. I've server hopped about 12 times now and nothing but pods. I wish they'd make the quest to trigger this a daily.
---
Wasnt aware you could buy! Thanks!
---
If you mean the exact amount, it's underflow error. This is probably the highest absolute value the game is capable of processing for item cost
---
Ok thanks very much. I will look again. 
---
At the same time, I also run a sneak build...my character is rather bi-polar...one second she's all sneaky deaky next thing she's tossing grenades and hailing down hellfire with mini nukes and other explosions.
---
Similar situation here.  I play when my kids sleep.  Deathgod905 is my PSN. I founded a PvP focused group for this game (Skull Farmers), and the younger dudes are on a lot more than I am, so if the time doesn't match up you'd be able to tack on with them.  
---
We're mostly PvP, survival mode players at the moment,  but  dudes will drop nukes in Adventure mode as well. 
---
LOL.....
---
It's a direct port of Fallout 4. They literally copy and pasted the entire game and then made a few adjustments.
---
If you‚Äôre tired of power armor take Iron Clad and uhh the strength perk that gives you more ballistic def the higher the stat. Big help too in a hazmat suit. Then grab Fireproof and Blocker. You shouldnt have much difficulty staying vertical in pve.  
---
Grafton monsters usually have 20+ caps on a kill, hard to find large amounts of cryptids though. 
---
Platform
---
Can I join 
---
Grind through the events. Look for nuke zones. Do the golf course clubhouse in a loop of finishing it, scrapping loot, and server hopping yo repeat. Nuke zones.
---
Ok, so the blueprint I have is for a "vault tech- jumpsuit". It doesn't look quite like a under armor suit, it's more like the mechanics jumpsuit, in blue, with a large vault tech logo and vault tech badging. 
---
I see your point, it makes sense to use X-01 for the nuke zones. However, I still think that it‚Äôs overrated and T51b is a better alternative, not only because of the stats but also availability of the mods and repair cost. 
---
In a brief moment of insanity I thought the thumbs up upvote was a middle finger and next to your bold text it just looked hilarious and then I came to my senses
---
Ahh. I hate that time difference. I'll probably be on earlier Wednesday evening, around 5 EST, if you're free then. 
---
Yes everyone welcome join in
---
Also it is easy to miss if you don't have your pip boy light on.
---
Kill,graffton monsters too for 15-20 caps, behemoths drop caps too and clear enemies from workshops for 20 caps a time, you don‚Äôt need to take the workshop just do the enemy clearing on whatever workshops,you pass on your vendor and cap stash route. Whitesprings ghouls drop caps although it‚Äôs only 1-5 caps but it all adds up. Designing an efficient route that minimises fast travel helps too. Unless you want to trade rare weapons/armour you may have to other players or engage in P.V.P options are limited.
---
Whitespring and events. Sleep and eat the cranberry recipe 
---
I honestly think if anything it's a heavy weapon, but.
---
I'm on XB and have close to 300 hours in the game. I suppose part of it is the definition of griefing. Some people consider things griefing that others don't. As a cranky old lady with a low tolerance of being pestered at all in 76, I would say I've been griefed four or five times. I'm sure some of those times people wouldn't consider griefing.
---
So, no, I don't think it's rampant on console.
---
Always
---
Yeah but I like saving up flares and running around like a madman lighting up the sky for no apparent reason.
---
No doesn‚Äôt !
---
I am near overseer camp
---
That‚Äôs hilarious!
---
What gets me is that my little rifle is more effective than the rocket launcher.  So now it‚Äôs like congrats on being over-encumbered, now you have this stick to throw at things that will only piss them off.... and you‚Äôre too heavy to run away!!!! Yippee!!! 
---
I‚Äôve looked all around the vault door, inside and out. Now that I know better where it is I‚Äôm going to find it by Jove!! Thx again. 
---
And you can grow massive amounts of corn and razorgrain in the safety of your camp. Makes wine not worth making!
---
What‚Äôs the big deal about the civil war reenactor
---
Useless rolln on a gat, I have a few of these saving them for legendary vendor 
---
there is a random encounter where a set of raider power armor tells you to get out and that hes gonna find and kill you if you get in his armor 
---
Yeah, I just log off.  Had three guys blow up my camp as I was building it (different guys, different servers) and had to switch worlds until I could finish in peace.  I get that's part of the game but I don't get the appeal of harassing a level 18 when you're level 100+.  Then I had a guy walk up and just hand me underarmor and a legendary gun and wanted nothing in return.  There are plenty of awesome people playing, too.
---
I play solo and don't think it needs a buff. 
---
Are u always mutated? If so starched genes is mandatory
---
If you're on any time until ~9pm CST today then I'll stop by, if not I'd still love to try sometime in the evening in the next few days.
---
Could if you were on ps4.. but I can tell you how to get the plans. Fast travel to the railway station to the east of the watoga train station shop. There are 2 sets of rail cars on the tracks as you follow the rails east, with various goodies inside. In the third car of the north most set of trains there is a shelf to the left where they spawn in. Other related plans also spawn here. If you don't find any/the ones you want, server hop, repeat. Hope this wasn't too confusing.
---
The only people using power armor in PVP these days are using an exploit. At least, that I've seen. Or, they get killed very very easily.
---
pretty sure a lot of the lore about the scorchbeasts can be found in the brotherhood of steel asylum, might be wrong though
---
Gives plans for the civil war outfits and hats
---
I‚Äôll be on in about 30 minutes or so. 
---
I agree, but then I‚Äôd say the same for the gauss and the put that in the Rifle tree ü§™
---
I've had my camp there since last year.
---
So, with VATS...  
---
First, there's the stealthboy issue. Those things are way too prevalent. Plus the people with thousands of them.  
---
Second, say you're a melee build - you know your first few hits won't hit 90% of the time, right? By the time you get one to land, you're dead.
---
Depends. If you aren‚Äôt an actual heavy build using power armor, AA beats TS. 
---
If you are using Stabilized and power armor, TS wins. 
---
If you‚Äôre comparing AA without explosive to TSE, TSE wins. 
---
If both have explosive, TS wins. 
---
Super mutants have caps. 
---
When we expand to PS4 I will notify you can you could be brach leader 
---
Still here folks .. come see me it's 3:17 est will stay till 3:25
---
I appreciate that, thanks and I look forward to being a part of the guardians.
---
Np 
---
People without it die very easily as well. So what? And what exploit are you talking about. 
---
Change the Scorched to Draugers, and the YaoGuai to bears and...
---
Wait a minute...
---
I tried using a bloodied rocket launcher on the Scorchbeast Queen and I was near death it's damage output was less than 400. It's a joke. It needs at least 400% boost to be useful. The same with fat man.
---
&gt;However, I still think that it‚Äôs overrated and T51b is a better alternative
---
how is it overrated? its relatively easy to get,it has the best overall state in the game and the mods are relatively cheap too
---
&gt;mods 
---
ehh it depends,if you have someone who can mod the t-51b for you i guess but if you don't 5000 caps per mod plan is way too expesnive you  can get calibrated shocks jetpack and hud overlay for 5k caps if you server hop enough 
---
The nice thing is that if you're on pacifist the griefers legitimately can't fuck with you, for the first time since launch. For the first time "play your way" isn't a fucking lie. It's pleasant, for sure. 
---
Of course you can jump on a roof.  
---
Are you genuinely trying to say that everyone hopping around like morons, shooting at each other is a good idea?  
---
I also made very clear that these are assumptions on how the game was meant to be played. You can assume, in an immersive RPG, that a ridiculous thing like that is not what they had in mind. Just like... they didn't have everyone running around backwards in mind either, but if it gave a tactical advantage everyone would do it.  
---
What I'm saying is that there are very easy fixes for the glaring issues the game has that would make it better for everyone.
---
The house behind Dolly Sods, on the second floor, behind a locked door. It spawns the outfit and the mask, I got both yesterday!!
---
My PC experience? It happened alll the fucking time. I legitimately envy people like you.
---
Same for true hiker
---
What's your screen name?  A friend was considering doing a launch later today. 
---
Pay attention to where he tells you to place it. There's a shed you'll want to keep out of the blast zone. 
---
Happened to me too, finally today after about a barrel of whiskey (for the quest) it finally registered.
---
They do need a buff, there‚Äôs whole portions of the map that can be nuked and you‚Äôll find virtually nothing. It should just change the enemies and plants, it should at least add more enemies. 
---
They did a very early april fools joke when they launched this game
---
Thanks a bunch for sharing that link.
---
I role play as Ashton Garvey, a former police chief eho wants to eatablish a group to help fellow Vault dwellers. Protect the people at a minute's notice.
---
I think the info on it is in the Enclave. 
---
I've heard it can double amount of enemies. That is all. 
---
Ah the notorious shed. I'm guessing it's for easy travels.
---
PlayStation name is GreenGamerGuy
---
Actually found the reenactor in Charleston and he had the plans on him. I'm thinking it can randomly spawn at any random encounter point ( I think he is usually found further Northeast at or near the reenactment). The spot I found him at is across the small pond behind the building across the tracks to the east of the shop (go towards when responder bot spawns in and keep going, it'll be on the left as you go south on the road at the top of the small hill). A lot of the time there is just a suitcase with a not in it leading you to some meh armor, so it can be hard to spot.
---
Thanks for sharing this awesome story!
---
I prefer to hide just outside the bunker so people think I'm inside the bunker. Watch them go in and out all day.
---
You can craft a vault tech jumsuit that looks similar. 
---
Passive perks = yes. 
---
Perk load outs we can swap between = yes. 
---
More perk points to distribute = no. Learn to prioritize and make sacrifices.
---
I made it 3 hours, good times.
---
Mole Miners they love missiles
---
Need to try that!!
---
I‚Äôm down. GT EvilBrad3884 Just shoot me a message when you are ready I‚Äôll be signing on right around 7est 
---
Damage Resistance deals with 80% of the damage from creatures in this game. Radiation resistance is virtually irrelevant and both T51b and Ultracite has better stats for it. What I mean by overrated is that by default people assume X-01 is better, but it‚Äôs actually not. I use X-01 a lot and it‚Äôs a really good set but my goal is to let fellow survivors know that it‚Äôs now the best in general.
---
There are plenty of modders here on reddit and other places as well, with lower or equal prices to that. People sell X-01 jetpack for over 3000 caps just because it‚Äôs so rare, but there are plenty of modded who mod T series for far less, and even free sometimes if the buyer supplies the materials. It‚Äôs not worth to server hop 30 times to get a chance to have a X-01 jetpack, imo.
---
Those "adjustments" including online play and PvP... Just play fallout 4.. you clearly don't like 76. Why play it? I don't like a game so I'll just moan until they change it.. fuck off man. Play something else?
---
My best gag was dropping a bag full of useless crap and the "You Have Been Insulted" note
---
So you are saying that you have almost 3 years played time on a game that was released 3.5 years ago? I call BS man comeon, even if you just left your PS4 on......for 3 years straight
---
.....comeon.
---
One star legendaries do work.  I got all my kills server hopping and claiming Tyler dirt track and doing leader if the pack with newbie characters.  Went by pretty quick.  Logged into main for last kill for leveled weapon.
---
I carry one on me for situations like this. "Oh shit my main gun broke, I'm out of ammo on my spare, and melee in this game is fucking garbage for me" events don't happen OFTEN, but they do happen.  And also just the good old "You can't fast travel while enemies are nearby" with fucking _nothing_ around you that happens to me every other play session.

I how far away someone in survival can see them? The draw distance for players and camps is definitely increased in that mode (on ps4). 
---
Well done write up sir
---
I keep seeing wood piles and thinking I can get some scraps.  The same thing happened with Skyrim where I kept seeing the same flowers as I drove into work.
---
It should be about there I had chronic depresision and was unemployed for 2 of those years I'll check nut I'm definetly over 800 days
---
Or when you exit the vault.
---
I‚Äôm pretty surprised sneaking hides the top 3. That seems counter productive. 
---
Reminder that triple A studios abuse the term BETA.
---
Advantage is that instead of investing heavily your points into Charisma, you can invest them into other things, like Adamantium Skeleton, Supressor, Tenderizing and so on.
---
every game has issues. I always say if you enjoy it then it doesn't matter what someone else thinks 
---
It will change over time this is just the first draft. It obviously needs a lot of work. You understand how this works right? Its tested and tweaked until it gets to a state the majority enjoys. It's called game development. You seem to only know how to regurgitate negative garbage. Cant wait for your next  enlightening rebuttal
---
Good question I tried on adventure mode with multiple eyes on the sky and 100 ( on the team will display some numbers ) 100 seemed to be the draw distance ( Xbox one x )
---
That it till next time folks
---
A teammate will increase your chances much better than a level. 
---
I strongly agree with 1-4. Not so much on the rest but those 4 are good ideas
---
Tried that too - no luck :(.  I was wandering around Charleston naked with no perks and a fireaxe lol
---
I put in a ticket - see what they say.
---
How do you see in the binocular?
---
I was at level 2 and got freaked out when a level 130 or so approached me with a "come here" emote. I followed, and wound up with a ton of stuff that I'm just figuring out how to use (screws . . . I've heard that screws are important and hard to get, right?). Thank you, whoever you were!
---
Also it came out in 2015
---
what console do you use? 
---
Whitesprings Resort Sentry Bot Guards- lvl95 Sentry Bots which are only hostile against people who broke rules inside Whitesprings resort.
---
Thanks a ton!
---
Damn you're lucky. Screws seem to make up everything. 
---
Have you ever been inside the secret room inside the secret room?
---
Barely, it's pretty mutch the worst scope, but makes for some funny/creepy clips Haha
---
It‚Äôs a news for me that the ‚Äúultimate‚Äù PA (X-01) doesn‚Äôt have the highest DR.
---
They also need to add timers on events. I wasted caps wp to events when they're far away just to land on "Failed" or "timer up". 
---
well the summer expansion is Nuclear Winter.
---
Exactly why they sneak
---
You want to change a game mode instead of changing the way you play. I agree with some of your points but honestly you should tailor your alt or character to the enemy not change the game because people don‚Äôt know how to pvp. Have a problem with stealth? Take anti stealth measures. Use mentats to make them visible and shoot sentinel with a Tesla rifle. They will move. Shoot Cav with a cryolatot. Kill melee with shotguns. Everything has a counter y‚Äôall just too lazy to do the work to counter people. Have a problem with explosive weapons? Get better armor with dense torso and use fireproof and you negate  mostly all of their dmg. Go ahead and thumbs down but just because your expert picklockibg doesn‚Äôt save you in pvp doesn‚Äôt mean my pvp focused account should be nerfed because of it. 
---
It pretty easy. Forest event "Leader of the Pack" gives you 3 points into that challenge. Server hop and be done. Just that weapon aint worth the time.
---
If ever I need help with that I'll be sure to hit you guys up. I've sent the both of you friend requests under this same name on PSN. 
---
Have a Maximina and minimum of damage taken given regardless of level , no more one shots , and spawn killing lock as you can‚Äôt kill same player back to back ( nor he could attack you )
---
I agree on most points, but dont assume they didn't earn the guns, they may just be leveling an alt and using weapons gained on their main.
---
Do you miss the same character for survival?
---
GMT-7 I come from the land where daylight savings doesn't exist. I'm 8 hours behind you I believe. 
---
Normally the first never lands for me and heres a tip hit em even if its just one hit.. And vats will lock on and carry a exsplosive ranged weapon. So you can tag em from a distance. Theres so many ways to counter stealthboys and ranged shooters you just have to get creative. And hey use stealth boys. Unarmed builds wont survive no matter what you buff or debuff without stealth boys and also crouch as long as they cant vats you to start crouch smashes vats all day
---
I had a quad instigating missile launchers that does awesome damage with max level Demolition expert. Let fly 4 missiles in 1 second and it kills everything 
---
Although I don't agree with OP's reasons for wanting the challenges changed(His personal problems with alcohol), I can agree that making most of the challenges alcohol based is tiring/uninteresting.  
---
I have not, but after Googling it, it's my next destination haha
---
Collect and bulk things like steel, aluminium, lead and ballistic fiber and sell it to other players.
---
Scorched. I'd love to walk around with green shit sticking out of me.
---
Damn. Well I hope you can find some people that are closer to your time to play with üëçüèª
---
EVen better, nuke Monangh. The hills to the north and east of town have dozens of blast berries and other cobalt flux things.
---
Yeah, I've ran into way more players wanting to share plans, junk, or ammo they don't need then I have assholes. Granted I haven't played survival yet, and I've heard the spawn camping around stations is bad.
---
&gt; Damage Resistance deals with 80% of the damage from creatures in this game
---
and yet some of the most damaging attaks are energy from scorchbeast shriek spam 
---
&gt;. Radiation resistance is virtually irrelevant
---
its actually not bt ok 
---
&gt;T51b and Ultracite has better stats for DR
---
DR is is not that big of an issue,melee damage can be easily mitigated with the blocker perk and ranged normal damage is usually a non issue 
---
&gt;What I mean by overrated is that by default people assume X-01 is better
---
it has the best overall stats in the game so it kinda is ,its also easy to get instead of server hopping for levle 50 t-51b parts at watoga which is quite a pain btw 
---
&gt;There are plenty of modders here on reddit and other places as well, with lower or equal prices to that
---
well since the plans for t-51b are no longer extremely rare i guess you do have a point to some degree 
---
If you‚Äôre fighting them on uneven ground they‚Äôll never land. You can force them to land (if they attack with scorched) by killing their scorched entourage. 
---
They don‚Äôt need a nerf. They got nerfed already. Killing three is only a challenge on lvl 50, and it should be. 
---
Thats the beauty of alcohol. It only get better.
---
Good job. 
---
It sounds like a complete waste of a nuke 
---
Heroes, capes, etc.
---
Nah, both sides have toxic and friendly players, though generally more "adults" play on PS4/PC where is a lot of younger people play on Xbox One.
---
But I own all 3 (and have competed in games professionally on all of them) and see a mix of toxic and good players on all systems.
---
That's awesome
---
Added you. 
---
It's a dragon.
---
If u want 
---
Funny, actually went on and he was there... Have the reenactor on ps4 right now, we3jesters
---
Why do you think 1 player should be able to compete with a team of players?
---
It‚Äôs not even close to a lawless post apocalyptic world. For that we would need factions, faction protected zones etc. quite sure the best and brightest of a vault would have started a new faction. Anyone with half a brain understands strength in numbers
---
4 person team is not anywhere close. So now we are left with weird mixes. Buy atomic shop and show off your fancy camp just to be easily trashed. Either ways as OP pointed now Survival lets people scratch their PvP itch without taking a shit on adventure peeps
---
Awesome. Add me or send me your GT and I'll send an invite
---
Does he have the plans
---
So progress and level increases carry over?
---
I find the fatigues at camp venture alot 
---
Greaser jacket and jeans is always spawning on the beds in the flatwoods church for me. Check it out!
---
Camp protection from player damage is coming in the future. It's not implemented yet. 
---
Cool. Add me or send me your GT and I'll send an invite. 
---
5 bulks of each junk, build/sell things asap. You have iron, lead and gunpowder- turn them into bullets asap. You have 5 bulks of leather, find more leather in world, don't pick up. Or if you do, bulk and sell asap. Rad-x, Radaway piling up- sell portion of the stack. There is no point hording things that you get more than you use.
---
You think they'd have enough foresight to have implemented this. So daft.
---
Correct.
---
It has not been implemented yet, if I read it correctly is being considered for future release.
---
Yeah when I checked, I saw "new undergrounds" mentioned again. Still you are missing what I'm pointing. Arktos will be one of them but it's not mean only one underground will came and it's will be Arktos. Or I didn't say vault 51 will be only one. So why I said to vault 51 can be one of them. And I explained why I'm guessing this.
---
I‚Äôve been wandering around in my x-01 far too long since the beta. Time to collect/craft a T51b. Thanks for all the work and sharing your wisdom!
---
That‚Äôs a very good point!
---
Good deal. Got them. Thank you
---
Gt: Quantumblast11 
---
Superb!
---
Wanted to add I have the same issue. Sent my third ticket in today, glad to see I am not alone in this.
---
Just sent u chat message 
---
Lets look at what's happened to events.   
---
Feed the people stopped feeding the people. It used to be legitimately worth doing, because you would \_feed the people\_. Some fucking idiot decided this was a bug, and removed it. It's not worth doing now.   And yet the event that puts flowers in your inventory hasn't been nerfed, because that item is pretty much useless.   
---
Uranium fever was a fucking FANTASTIC event, you went in, the rewards for the event itself might or might not be good, but it was a surefire way to get 3 legendary enemies, usually max level, usually multi-star. Then you nerfed it so mole miners NEVER drop max level gear. This destroyed not only uranium fever, but \_all mole miner locations as a whole)\_.    
---
Generally speaking, the system is garbage. It's been stated repeatedly they don't want to put a map marker detailing how long the event will last because it's to complicated...It boils down to being to hard, because they would have to provide more information on the screen than a count down timer. (all we need is the count down timer. give us THAT, and if it fails as we show up, oh well, it's better than what we fucking have now, guys).   
---
Over all, events aren't worth doing unless you happen to be there.  XP and cap rewards are too low, the cap rewards barely pay for fast travel to and from the location, the XP can generally be gained by killing 2-3 level 60 mobs. The item rewards are, generally, trash, a little scrap, ammo for weapons you don't use (the vast majority of the ammo I get are for heavy weapons, energy weapons, or explosive weapons.) Chems you don't need, and, if you're LUCKY, a 1-2 star garbage legendary.   
---
Events. Are. Boring. You do them all once, maybe twice.  Then you do them if they're nearby, or if they provide a side benefit.    
---
I do uranium fever when I need a bunch of steel scrap and glowing meat. That's it.   
---
The issue isn't "we don't want to do events". It's "events aren't worth doing, because you've systematically made the few that were worth doing less and less worth while" this is a result of chosen actions by your company. It's not "disappointing". It's inevitable, due to your decisions.   
---
Want to fix events? Make the rewards better, maybe plug in a script that drops ammo for weapons you have in your inventory, instead of random shit?  Up the XP rewards. Up the cap rewards. Make it 2-5% more likely that you will get a 3 star legendary reward?   
---
Give us \_something\_. Instead of taking something away.   
---
Its already awesome perks as 30% faster ap regen is great and 20% dmg resistance is pretty good trough your whole play trough
---
No worries!
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and do not experience this issue 
---
I see, I just never tried to look into one...
---
Honestly if you can't remember if you've been through a part of the game or not,it is going to take alot more than a [cleared] tag to help you.
---
Ok thanks. I was almost positive it had come into effect. I guess till then it's another way for trolls to enjoy themselves. üëç
---
I play it for the extra exp and spookiness. My character is pretty much perma stealth so I normally can see danger boys before they see me and avoid/deal with them. The loot bags are like little mini events too, you can find good ones in the mire and cranberry from where people die from creatures. If they take out the leaderboard I think the game will slowly shift from deathmatchish to more survival, slowly getting rid of the people you dislike.
---
Just change servers as soon as they start being dicks. 
---
Feel better? Did you get that out of your system? Good. 
---
Just happened to me. Launched a nuke at at Whitesprings. Got there.  Disconnect. 
---
Server hop to find another nuke zone.  Find one.  Disconnect. 
---
And you can jump in there and repair weapons. 
---
It looked like you were online now so just tried joining you but it failed
---
it's pkay as it is
---
I run bloodied sniper build, there really no chance for you if I spotted you first.
---
Optimistic of you to think they will _ever_ buff _anything_ in this game. 
---
I think I bought the plan as well, but I don't remember exactly. 
---
I do Fertile Soil every time I can. It only gives you this:
---
Leather armor peice
---
Stimpack
---
Radaway
---
1-4 Purified water
---
random XP
---
Random caps.
---
Its ridiculously easy you kill 3 protections and access a terminal. its mkore orientated for the new/low level players. The enemies dont level with you. 
---
I agree Fast travel to nearby events should be free and events that is farther away should have a deeply discounted cap cost.
---
If it worked with Cola Nut aswell it would‚Äôve been 600% ü§©
---
How about 5?
---
I did. After I blocked them. It's just annoying. 
---
‚ÄúLooks cool‚Äù hahaha I needed that. That‚Äôs like a scrawny nerdy dude getting a skull tattoo to try to look badass. It‚Äôs cute. 
---
Just having some fun at your expense. Play as you wish man and have a great day. 
---
Super cool ! What's that mask?
---
Dmg cap should be determined by armor 
---
If no one can help you out beforehand I can make you one when later tonight around 7est GT EvilBrad3884 
---
Look up the fallout 76 playlist on youtube or Spotify and then listen and find the one you‚Äôre looking for
---
 Went through it, think it must be incomplete 
---
In Appalachia
---
True
---
Next time it plays in game try shazaming the song cause I don‚Äôt recognize those lyrics
---
If it weren‚Äôt for the people, the bugs and server instability would have run me off long ago.  I‚Äôve run into so many great, generous people in the game, and have dumped a ton of stuff to lowbies, with no great way to communicate (no mic and no great emotes).
---
Last night I was doing Uranium fever and a higher level joined up.  Cleaned it out, no great drops but I had a spare Greek Letter set and dropped it for him.  He in turn dropped a few thousand shotgun shells.  I‚Äôd actually moved shells from other characters over to this one, and was on my last 200 or so, so this was a tremendous gesture.  Sadly he left and has messages blocked on PS4, 
---
Got the suit this time, relogging with a friend now to see what I get if anything. I think it is 1 per person but you can trade duplicates if nothing else.
---
.. yeah, was just a holotape when I relogged.
---
Ok, thanks!
---
Tell that to Dark Souls.
---
I like west Tec.  
---
Great pic.  Radstorms are way too rare!
---
Lol maybe I just completely misheard the lyrics, it was kind of a rocky folly song like atom bomb baby 
---
Not an issue for my ladies
---
Lol can I buy it from u
---
The parade got so much traffic because it had rare rewards that we could only get for one week. I got my last plan on the last run of my last day. I never got a rare mask, and honestly I'm more than a little burned by that. I put in...I don't know how many runs, and I got _nothing but trash_. In my opinion, that parade was _very_ badly done. 
---
We've been through this. They block for future updates, too.  If it's blocked that ain't changing.
---
If I fast travel to every event I see on a map I could, easily, blow through more caps in a day than I can make up selling to vendors, especially given the fact that so many events fail just as you show up due to fucking _horrible_ game design. 
---
Yes I know this but I have loved my camp somewhere completely different 4 times and it didn‚Äôt work even places where my friends camps are completely fine and it still says the same thing 
---
Whitesprings, Watoga, Harper's Ferry.
---
Yeah I thought about that. Here is how/why it could still work... the modeling of items/assets would still take some skill and of course could only be done on pc... that alone would limit the amount of people who would take advantage of it... also, to prevent custom made items from being shared between players, they could make it so that only the author of the item could use it... all of this should be enough to keep the atomic shop viable

I will inevitably blow myself up with the missile because I'm a moron.  Which makes me laugh so hard. Same with grenades. I'm a Fucking moron.
---
I really missing the upgrades from fo4, also PA should get its own set of legendary modifers.
---
Maybe make an offer lol. You can just join me and see what you find
---
you know it
---
Ok, legitimate question here. What on earth is "immersive" for paying caps to travel on a map, with no means of transportation, no fuel costs, no bus system?
---
Bruh read the chat message 
---
I feel like it's just a natural evolution though. Either that or not allow us to change our build unless we are in our camp to remove the obvious urge to min max like that
---
Hey just tossing it out there,  but they're are 2 super rare Fire Breathers suits that drop from events on the forest.  A sad .02% drop rate üò≠
---
It could be you're placing the node in an awkward position, too close to something like another building or train tracks. 
---
I wouldn't know, I haven't played in 3 days because no loot will respawn for me.
---
&gt;Uranium Fever
---
I foregot about uranium fever. I got stuck in the middle of this event one time while I was trying to loot Blackwater Mine. Gonna have to give it a go again once I get back into the game.
---
I do agree that not all should be lost, however it is dying. Personally I don't run around with aid items so I'm not as concerned.
---
Craft some Carrot soup and get her back to base.  
---
Yes I think it's coming in a future update.  For adventure mode. 
---
Im game  GT: BLUBLZREDEUX
---
I like this! Not the common "house" camp.
---
I‚Äôll try that and see if that is the case. Thanks!
---
Definitely fix the railroad camping and I think we should have to make new characters it's not fair to be 1 shot by someone with a 2 shot explosive. When not everyone has guns like that. I dont mind d them being there but only if you got one fair and square in survival
---
Hes going home to the country roads where he belongs in west virginia
---
Scopes please! 
---
No. I triple nuked Whitesprings and there were only the regular amount of Glowing ones. Nothing special in the loot drops either.
---
I just got disconnected as well
---
I think you've found the new meta for people who are perpetually overencumbered.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs really useful during survival. I new I would be top of the leaderboard when I logged on last night but I didn‚Äôt think I would about 3 hours ahead of everyone else. Needless to say I realised people were bearing down on my level 24 survival character from across the map. In anticipation to this I made sure I log on near wavy willards but even this wasn‚Äôt enough because I could see people moving to my location. So the vintage nukashine really helped save my bacon and annoy my enemies. 
---
Ar rock and roll type of song, Uranium?
---
So besides bulking junk/looting outfits/looting gear and selling other way is doing events and just playing. Goes up slower but you'll be amazed how much you can accumulate. 
---
I agree with this. I can take on most enemies 1v1 there are some that I need help defending.
---
I have my CAMP set up by the overseers camp with a bar, rooms to sleep in, open water purifier etc just for this reason.
---
OH, could‚Äôve been he was saying ‚ÄúU-rany-um‚Äù in stead of ‚Äúyou tear me up‚Äù
---
Bruh I'm not even ready to part with my weapons yet so no survival for me
---
Cultist mask you can find it in the mothman museum west of vault 76 üòÅ
---
You lost ALL your stimpacks in one death? Damn, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm scared to go to survival mode. I have like 600 stimpacks. And I carry them all on me since they‚Äôre too heavy to fit in my stash.
---
Women tend to see things like old desk fans, typewriters, clipboards, etc. as junk and would rather throw it away. Men are almost positive they can use said junk. The game has a built in feature to make it harder for you to find junk items as a female character. In fact, it is much easier to find these items as a male character. It's actually a feature to make it harder to survive as a woman. 
---
Exactly my reason for avoiding it
---
Dependent on level also but bloodied is way better and more sought after.
---
Yes. Some Melee and Heavy Weapons also have a strength requirement to fully utilize their potential. Besides, there's still the carry weight and 3 less points amount to -15 pounds of possible loot.
---
Ammo, hoard ammo. We are all in need of ammo and if you've been collecting a ton of ammo you don't use, it will make another survivor VERY happy. If you don't want to look intimidating, a responders outfit, pastor outfit or paramedic would be good.
---
I haven't...I've only had it happen once in bogtown where a typewriter didn't spawn on the desks
---
Totally, I just thought the point was to have the top 3 visible. Now someone can just crouch somewhere and do nothing and be top 3 and never found. 
---
Is it Uranium? https://youtu.be/ZUWok5b7FDE
---
Tank Killer perk plus an anti-armor magazine will help.
---
That's the biggest load of bullshit I ever done see!
---
The Cultists mask.  There's also robes that match.  Off hand.  Best place to loot them both is behind Rilley clays bunker,  go up the hill west there's a church buried up to the steeple and way down in the basement is a shrine with both the outfit and the mask.  
---
I have to go back there anyway to find something I missed so I‚Äôll check it out. 
---
I'm on Xbox One, maybe it's my console...
---
Nice to know! Worth making a detour for every now and then just in case. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
That only applies to a bounty 
---
Yep, thanks 
---
Rarely ever get disconnected on PS4. Probably once a week of that.
---
I did say my weak imagination ;-) don‚Äôt ask me to rationalize
---
That‚Äôs it, thanks
---
Could be
---
Strategy not the best but yeah
---
It was!
---
Idk, I saw a legendary ghoul and was like üòÄ-üò¶ get back here! Over encumbered it was an experience to chase the damn thing down. 
---
Have a mic, talk friendly, leave low levels some stims and camp plans. If they do talk back then ask if they want some assistance in leveling/quests. It's pretty hard if you dont have a mic, some just runaway from you
---
Not simple enough apparently 
---
This and it scares me every time I hear the whizzling sound of a rocket incoming from out of nowhere.
---
Just checked,  I am not able to craft tomahawks. Sorry I could not help.
---
That's alright, I appreciate your generosity anyways.
---
Today I experienced something that had not happened for a long time: I lost whole bunch of stuff that I was transferring between accounts via paper bag to a server disconnect.
---
Inb4 (because Todd forbid one dare to suggest that something bad may happen in the game that is not the customer's fault in one way or another) 'well, is your PC/connection/whatever bro': thing is the other account is logged in a remote PC located in a completely different country (using a Shadow) so I am going to go for 'no bro, the server crashed on me'.
---
This is getting more frequent too, so shame on me in that regard for ignoring the signs and lulling myself into a false sense of security.
---
Is not as bad as it was originally - but again that is not saying a lot because the first couple of months were awful - but I am definitely getting disconnects, CTDs doing mundane stuff like eating or changing weapons and general unresponsiveness more often than I did between patch 6 and 7, and is getting worse...
---
Plus my old acquaintance 'Cannot find server' is back... wish he had stayed wherever he went, he was not missed...
---
Sometimes. Nice to have a missile launcher or a heavy gun to mess with other players, mostly. 
---
It depends on the minimum lvl of the weapon or armor, like combat rifle lvl 25. I'm not sure for legend effect but I have seen lvl 5s of a lot of effects.
---
Yeah im level 80 and this is my FIRST one yet!
---
Was pretty cool regardless üòä
---
Hah!
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been adjusting to it and I think my opinion may be changing. 
---
West-Tek, Whitesprings, Watoga are all good for grind loops.
---
Events as mentioned. Uranium Fever &amp; Horde events will give legendary enemies to boot.
---
Well Rested &amp; I don't remember which food will boost Exp earned for a time.
---
Story missions seem to reward quite well if you've any left. 
---
Oh yeah they can have you in the middle of almost defeating a SBQ and the drop the server.
---
I need to start doing this, I have way too much of certain ammos I don‚Äôt use. 
---
Though, I do wish we could scrap ammo to make more. It‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do in real life after all.
---
Stimpacks, diluted will do. Basic weapons, such as knives, aren't resource heavy. If you're not a chem user, drop off whatever you don't use yourself. If you want to be remembered drop Power armor chassis too. No attachments and it only weighs about 10 units. Usable by all lower levels. Just remember to drop it, not place it, otherwise they won't be able to access it.
---
Appreciate it!
---
Has nothing to do with survival mode. It's the fact that they took out slap damage and and will eventually take out damage to workshops vs. non-combative opponents (although you could just log out if someone wants to mess up your camp). Honestly the fact that survival came out has made adventure harder in some cases because on more than one occasion did we launch a nuke and not have enough people of a high enough level show up to kill the Scorchbeast Queen. Never once before survival did I encounter a time when she wasn't taken down in seconds flat by 10-20 level 200's.  Now they're all in survival making caps off the unbalanced damage. This last time we launched a nuke I was in a team with two 120+ people, me and another guy are about the same lvl at 80-90ish. When we got to the fissure site there were literally only maybe 6 other players all level 50 and below many of whom didn't even have power armor and were just dying over and over.
---
And BOS plans.   Need the legs wagh...
---
Hell, I'd put up with Jun Long's moaning if he picked my damn crops.
---
Okay, thanks.
---
Exactly! There‚Äôs so much potential for the map and the nukes. 
---
Interesting analysis. I‚Äôve seen quite a few Assassin‚Äôs gear at vendor bots, from melee weapons to one-star armors, so I had the impression that people choose other legendary effects over Assassins. I‚Äôve yet to see many Assassin‚Äôs energy weapons though, maybe those are more effective or maybe there‚Äôs just not many of them out there. 
---
The weapon weights are generally more than they should be but at the same time, ammo weights are way less than they should be, realistically.  So, it's kind of a wash, IMO.  
---
However, the thing about weights that bothers me the most is that how on most firearms (shotguns mostly excluded I think), a short barrel weighs \*more\* than a long one.  That makes no sense to me whatsoever.
---
All of my good legendaries have come from whitesprings,  AA grognak axe, instigating double barrel, explosive handmade, furious handmade, instigating ski sword, I use vanguard armor whole set was  from whitesprings also. 
---
They‚Äôre all pretty much boring. I‚Äôm nuking different places at the moment to hopefully find a decent spot for the future. If I find anything I‚Äôll definitely be posting it on here. 
---
Do you have turrets and have to rebuild often?  
---
Some are, some arn't. 
---
But neither is because of their condition. 
---
Thanks buddy, if I should cross the pond I'll let you know haha
---
I run sent assassin full set with dense and fireproof and each dmg res perk except strengths. I‚Äôm also a sniper build relying heavily on crit and bloodied. I‚Äôve also played enough to know if I come back for you and we play a 1v1 you can‚Äôt touch me without melee or a shotgun with stagger 
---
It was more slowly I was carrying around 60 and died a few times, went to use one and was done to 7
---
Well they are releasing high level dungeons in the next update (I believe it‚Äôs the next one not 100% tho) so I‚Äôm assuming there‚Äôs gonna be new enemies in there.
---
You would make Elvis proud !!
---
What‚Äôs is your IGN, would you like to try?
---
I've got an AA with vats fill that I converted to auto and it chews through enemies. I think semi auto the fall short to the handmade and lever in most categories. 
---
Dang, I'm on the xbox. Sorry I can't help more. 
---
May the search be ever in your favor.
---
And hopefully if this gets enough likes we get Bethesda‚Äôs attention 
---
You're awesome. I would appreciate the help. GT: PhillKills
---
It came in handy when I had farmed a lot of flux in a nuke zone and I needed to get closer to home before it spoiled  and home was far away.
---
I‚Äôm aware of this 
---
"Mayor for life¬Æ"
---
Make Bobby Pins 1 whole pound each for like 1 minute before reverting to normal
---
You only drop a third of all your items on death so to loose all your stim packs you‚Äôd need to be carrying a lot of other crap too. To be honest, someone is gonna do you a favour because that‚Äôs way too many stim packs to carry around. 
---
Half of what you‚Äôre suffering through are the middle-levels-slog. You really are in the worst spot right now.
---
The mobs you face will often be higher-level scaled due to other players. You don‚Äôt have all your core perks, and more importantly you don‚Äôt have a set of weapons that also work well with your build for at least PVE, plus you don‚Äôt have the quality of life perks like Chemist, Super Duper, Ammosmith, etc. etc. ... also mutations.
---
That all starts to come together post-50, and hopefully by the time your‚Äôe 75 ish you‚Äôre mostly settled. 
---
Keep collecting what you can, but try to bulk and sell what your not using. Make every weapon and armor you can as well, then deconstruct to try to learn the mods.
---
Once you get that fist legendary that works w/ your perks, those QOL cards, etc. you can start really being picky about what you take. Stay strong, push on!
---
Thank you! Great Find. :-)
---
I hope this isn‚Äôt true.
---
Ohhhhh okay I see. Not too keen on the lore
---
Maybe in Fo4, but in 76 the handmade and lever are a better choice.  
---
Hmmmm. 30k bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet weilder anyone? You could effectively loan yourself out to kill SBQ in one hit.
---
I‚Äôve never noticed this issue but now I wonder if I‚Äôve just missed a lot of stuff for it.
---
I want no fast travel for the ultimate surbival experience. Only three locations. The vendor locale along with your camp and vault 76
---
Yup, starched genes makes them permanent. No limit to mutations other than you can‚Äôt have carnivore and herbivore at the same time.
---
I can confirm that for Washington DC at least. I put those same hundreds of hours into Fo3 at launch, then in the early 2010s I spent a week in DC. My first time in the Dupont Circle metro station I'm looking around wondering why it seem so familiar. Then it hits me, I've been here a thousand times before, just looking at it from track level. It was very surreal.
---
While they're add it buff everything I like and need everything I don't like, please?
---
Yes. If you have level 2 Starched genes it will stay with you regardless of radaway use. However be carefull as you can't selectively remove mutations so if you get one you don't want and you have multiple you might loose one you want while trying to remove the one you don't want.
---
You can have as many as you like. But they all have negative effects do be carefull and do your research.
---
Marsupial is pretty much the standard one you want along with speed demon. 
---
Someone is gonna do me a favor...lol. Who decides how many stimpacks is too many for me to carry? You?
---
What I do, I try a few other items and once I hit an item that shows the stats, I can RB/LB switch items inside the preview and go back to the one I want to inspect or make a screenshot of. Switching items while previewing has yet to cause the issue for me. 
---
If you‚Äôre in pc I can help you with any mutations you‚Äôd like. 
---
It's rare but pretty shit. I have a shop and I haven't been able to give my Two shot cyrolator away. 
---
Yep, that's how the serums work. Just the first hour is no negative effects. Use class freak to reduce any negative effects after that. Take as many mutations as suits your playstyle. 
---
You carry 20 30rd mags on your chest? 
---
I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you that the weights are absurd. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs for game balance reasons. Machine guns should be in game just fine, you just should be able to use any heavy weapon outside of power armor. 
---
I‚Äôll grant you I was just guessing for weigh on 50cal rounds, they‚Äôre half that. So a 5rd mag in your 50cal rifle would be 1.25lbs. Carry 100 bullets? 25lbs. 
---
Oh thank god, I thought I made a mistake scrapping all my launchers and throwing out my mini nukes and ordnance today, but I guess I wasn‚Äôt alone on this. Now a huge weight has been lifted off me and my CAMP
---
In Fallout, a certain percentage of people have a gene that, when they are exposed to lethal levels of radiation, causes them to turn into zombies instead dying. 
---
I haven‚Äôt tried since the post because my BL3 hype has me a bit busy, but I‚Äôll try later today and update my end as well. Also I haven‚Äôt been able to make it in the caverns past the loading screen and have not been there previously, is it tied to a quest or has it been previously? 
---
I have that happen once in awhile. Usually lasts an hour or so before I get disconnected. 
---
Nothing about this is a beta, it's launched, it's not a special client, all the progress you make carries over, anything you gain or lose is in the full game, it's a live mode live now. Calling it beta is just a dumb gimmick to trick dumbos into thinking bugs are acceptable. No other game does a "beta" this way. 
---
xbo?
---
Special: High agility, high perception.
---
Apparel: Tin Foil Hat.
---
Weapon: Binoculars, Wiffle Bat.
---
Yeah i tried the server hop. Moved my camp down there but i could never get it to spawn. What is the cool down time on plans, do you know? Thanks for the advice!
---
Can't you fast travel to your camp for free?
---
Hmm maybe!  It's just odd because the only thing destroyed is the generator.  
---
Cool. Can't wait to see that hahaha
---
It is possible, yea
---
If I ever stalk its gonna be with a mole suit and hat and a mole miner gauntlet
---
Lol no, you carry them in 200 round lots, 6 mags at a time and replace them as used. Sorry, I forget most people dont train lol. My vest is around 50 lbs when loaded with the rest in my ruck and thigh rig. 
---
I have a three-star bloodied version with 90% weight reduction still weighs 6 lbs, I imagine it won‚Äôt fit in the heavy weapon category because at unmodified 60 lbs it needs its own class lol 
---
Yeah right after I quit I was like: GODAMMIT I GAVE HIM WHAT HE WANTED!  
---
I shouldn't game while sick, I make terrible decisions.
---
Crits work pretty well
---
I have played this mode once, I saw the same people in the feed all killing each other at Whitesprings Station over and over. Someone came up to my base saw I was inside and tried to get in (to which I was sat at my CAMP immediately repairing all roof tiles broken). Then he decided to just shoot my whole base with his fancy TSE shotgun oo scary I'm so scared I'm gonna shid. So I thought 'right okay knobcheese come ere and get the succ' to which I pulled out my big dick energy in the form of an explosive bloodied MG42. He never came back. 
---
It's still happening to me...
---
...like, right meow. I just found that the ski lodge vendor had caps and sold 10 legendary things.
---
theyre basically "higher tier pipe" weapons due to how versatile they are. hunting rifles will make a better sniper base, assault rifles will make a better auto rifle base, and so on.
---
Fixed my issues. Then after quest was done I just re-equiped everything.
---
Depends on the other stars.
---
PS4 
---
In my case the most common source was the game deciding that the +2 CHR from Herd Mentality was not going to apply for the purpose of sharing perk cards unless all party members were within spitting distance of each other.
---
Because reasons and stuff.
---
No problem, I‚Äôll give you the suit no charge. If you want I can add the shielded lining (gives +2 strength +3 endurance) but I‚Äôd need caps to cover the flux. I think it uses 2 violet so 60 caps unless you have the flux in which case no charge at all. 
---
https://youtu.be/1av-wwg2_dc
---
Good luck hope you get it fixed. 
---
Dude, keep them and wait till the legendary vendor 
---
Not when over encumbered or if there are enemies nearby.
---
24 hours from when last looted by you, unless someone grabs it in that server/it just doesn't spawn (sometimes an attack will knock it off the shelf). I'd just not loot till I got the one I want and server hop. Don't just leave the world and return to game!! Join a server you know is a different one, maybe one a friend is in. Servers seem to be regional and can make it so you get trapped in a server loop where you aren't seeing many new items.
---
I'm trying to complete the weekly challenge for 25 legendary kills. Apparently only starred starred enemies count. Wish I could find a stack of them right now.
---
Nah theres a whole universe of things such as map control and tactical information sharing that you neglect as you probably try to enter gangs playground alone
---
I love PVP, very fun. Yet, having someone wait at your camp for you to respawn to take all your caps really ruins the fun. Had to respawn at the vault and couldn't come back to my camp for the whole game.
---
Ah. Sorry. Had just jumped on to sell some serums quick, then was afk. Trying to get all the house stuff done before I settle down to play.
---
Sadly the leaderboard has nothing to do with killing at all, except to ‚Äòbe‚Äô killed. It‚Äôs based solely on length of time alive.
---
Everywhere in the Forest.  It‚Äôs almosy as ubiquitous as Steel.  
---
It‚Äôs more than fine. It‚Äôs not designed to let you beat teams of people.  And this is not FO4.
---
I like the way you think. I'll have to wait until my wife gets online to hand all this to my mule.
---
With crystalizing barrel I'd use that, any other effects? I have a 3* explosive cryolator but I don't remember if it's a TSE. If it isn't I'll consider buying that from you. 
---
That‚Äôs a real shame. They even made pump shotguns‚Äô skin uglier prior to unveiling the paint so they could sell it, now it‚Äôs bugged. I‚Äôm on PS4 too. 
---
Helvetia and pickkets fort
---
Oh okay thanks m8
---
Maybe Arnholt's farm?
---
Hate to say it, but don't bother. I've taken everything down, hit the fuckit switch, and am pretty much done trying with it. Analytics say that my links have been seen by nearly 10,000, not a single click through. Reviews from here on Reddit and on some other social meeds basically say "Your shit is confusing and I've no idea what the point is, you need to scrap it and start over."
---
Well, I took the "Scrap it," not bothering with the starting over part. Abney Park's Downtrodden sums it up pretty well, and maybe it is depression or whathaveyou, but I work 12 hours a day, and just don't have the time to put the effort in for that kind of reward.
---
Noooooo... 
---
I want a cat...
---
You could definitely lighten up when it comes to video games good sir. 
---
The closest I've come to be being griefed was the last Fasnacht event i attended. After the parade we were standing around the bonfire when somebody decided to just take pot-shots at random players to see if anybody wanted PvP. A few people with headsets were asking what's his problem,and i just used the thumbs down emote before we all went our way. On PS4 if that's anything,and been playing since day 1.
---
I chameleon up behind distracted low level players and drop a bottle of hard liquor, then sneak away again
---
Look for the fallen dead trees on the ground they give 3-10 per log
---
Sylvie and Sons Logging Camp, slightly east from the Sons of Dane compound (where One Violent Night takes place).
---
Equip 'Woodchucker' - perk in the LCK tree just in case you are not familiar - and collect 320+ wood in 2 minutes or less.
---
It may also be worth making the distinction that the skirt and glasses item was not a limited time sale like Blackbird was.  Blackbird was one of those things only available for three (or however many) days vs. the skirt/glasses which were part of the normal stock since launch until it was recently removed.    
---
I believe the wording for that was something like the items were going "back into the vault" wich, in a disney-esque sense makes me believe that they will eventually come back out of the vault.  Maybe after being locked in there for 6 months or a year.   They'll probably go through the store a couple/few times a year and cull out standard stocked items that don't sell well and replace them with new content and then eventually with recycled content.
---
Two ways to kill. Built one myself this patch so used no glitches. My point was to learn how to penetrate them and I've been sharing them.
---
Nuka grenades rads go through foundations. Thats the expensive way. The coordinated one is different and you need a friend. You leave server and you rejoin your friend. Before the camp loads fully you may penetrate the walls and get inside.
---
While this is an interesting theory, I would be rather disappointed if it all turned out to be a simulation.
---
Yeah I always scrap/throw that stuff out. It just weighs way too much. I'd like to see someone post their explosives weapons build though to see if could actually be fun to use. 
---
Go up and down the dry river bed that the New River Gorge Bridge spans.
---
It's the giant green bridge in the southwest corner of the Forest region. I usually haul about 280 pieces of wood with woodchuck equipped. 
---
Someone must have grabbed it when i tried. Ill keep checking there.
---
Combat Rifle plans are from "The Motherlode" sidequest.
---
I‚Äôve noticed this happening to me a few times. I‚Äôd  go to clear out Whitesprings and get 5-6 legendaries off random ghouls. They were always 1 star but still cool. 
---
1. I wasn't alone. I was in a team. The guy who attacked was alone
---
2. I wasn't on any gang's playground. We were doing an event and some guy shows up and starts shooting  at us. 
---
3. What are you event talking about with gang playgrounds? No one is visible on the map unless they are in the top three. Not one word of anything you said resembles anything I've ever encountered in PVP
---
4. You act as if power armor alone is useless in PVP.  I repeat: I killed a guy who was not wearing power armor.  So whatever he had was useless as well. 
---
I don‚Äôt think you drop your weapons, just junk, caps and aids. 
---
Yeah I do and I did the same thing but meh. I will try that perk next time.
---
I have the caps to cover that. That will help for sure.
---
One thing i havent seen mentioned in this thread is the date: its literally always October 23rd in the PIP boy, no matter how much you sleep. Your house, leveling (skills), weapons, and inventory all persist, yet its always fall/halloween in the game. 
---
Its worth noting that Fallout 4 was not like this, it kept an accurate time and date from the moment you start the game. 
---
Of course i always assumed they may have done this so they could implement changes to the game world/seasons (since the game is stuck on the date/setting of when it released at this point)
---
I remember reading somewhere that u drop everything you have, might be wrong but idk
---
Yeah I figured.
---
This is an awesome post. Didn't know that could happen. I will begin my Deathclaw Whispering immediately.
---
Thanks, I reset the new xbox and created a totally separate Microsoft ID and gamertag etc and I am currently now waiting for the fallout 76 update to load on that new xbox.
---
So now I gone back to my main xbox where I have the Gold/Live account and went into settings and added the new xbox identity/gamertag as a family member. Does that mean once the new xbox updates I'll be able to launch Fallout76 on it and it will use the first xbox live account automatically to connect anytime someone plays fallout76 on it?
---
Thats makes sense. Handmade is one of the best rifles and one of the only snipers that can hope to out-damage a lever is a gauss
---
Alright good to know.
---
Lol no man in 200 round lots, I forget most people dont train. 6 mags on chest and replace them with fresh ones as they are spent. The rest in thigh rig and in my ruck. My vest weighs around 50 lbs fully loaded, ruck is about 35 fully loaded. I can still cross 4 miles in 20 minutes with full kit. Less if I'm pulling a load behind me on a litter. I literally did not even think to explain any if that in my last comment lol sorry. My bad
---
They‚Äôre not doing anything to bring players back anytime soon. You‚Äôre being punished for a long time so you know never to mess around again. 
---
A lot or maybe all of the plants have respawned in an area of the map
---
In my experience that flora is more abundant and has a chance of yielding double the amount per 'pick'.
---
Unsure if it affects anything else.
---
Basically the plants in the region are more productive. Sometimes you will get a message that the verdant season is continuing (or that it is ending). 
---
It's a good idea to let people know what platform you're on :)
---
Tar berries where originally mutated cranberries. Then they added cranberries again for some reason. 
---
Stealth Boy MK III's only work if you assign them to favorites and use them from there. They don't work if you use them from the Pip-Boy. Astoundingly competent, right?
---
I got an epic combat rifle with these effects ; vampiric, explosive and faster reload speed it rlly good
---
Its only aid and junk
---
Soz forgot, i keep getting my posts deleted because its not the right format :/ its ps4
---
Oh yeah those are some really good effects.
---
Oh okay well that's reassuring
---
Yeah I thought I meant more plant spawns or something, thanks 
---
Thanks again I look forward to your findings!!
---
Yeah lol
---
Lol if that‚Äôs the case you‚Äôll see nothing but butt-naked fist fights in survival mode. 
---
The productivity of the plants in the named region goes up basically
---
I agree with you 1000 percent!
---
Mine only worked for certain stocks. The paint wouldn't show for other variants.
---
Reddit hated that
---
Reddit disliked that
---
Wait, survival mode has launched? I should consider playing this game again mb.
---
Thanks! I try to think outside the ‚ÄúBox‚Äù!
---
That's not a nice thing to call your wife haha 
---
Ha! This is exactly what I saw the other night, until one guy got pissy, must've been losing, and they pull out a gun. Now that I think about it, where did they have it hidden?
---
Sorry mentioned game mods.
---
It has non
---
Pc.
---
 It's coming. 
---
Jeezus. You might want to have that looked at.
---
Equip Hard Bargain perks and eat grape mentats before selling stuff to bots. You can literally pick up anything in the game and sell it. All you need to do is Bulk them so vendor bots will buy them. The amount of sellable junks you can get from the the mobs you kill adds up real fast. 
---
Best in what way? Damage, fire speed, reload speed?
---
I never used it to escape, but I have used it when I'm bored and want to randomly explore. It's cool finding new locations for basically free.
---
Most versatile/useful in general
---
I thought the camp was ment to be on the pump grip as well it looks like it is in the shop photos.
---
Probably nothing bud. Just dump it or vendor it.
---
Its actually very easy. Event "leader of pack" gives you 3 points into that challenge and have very easy monsters to kill. Question rather is- is it worth? I didn't find that gun enough incentive for me to do the challenge. None of the guns do. Well they are better than 20 cap rewards and vanilla weapons, but still, they have nothing special. That special name is worth nothing.
---
Which system?  The only time it happened was on my Xbox, and it was because I deleted the reserved space, thinking it would fix a problem with the game somewhere right after launch.  Doing that deleted them all.  I didn't realize it until a little while later, but the time matches when the pictures started.
---
love the pics! thanks for sharing!
---
I like gifting things to people. there needs to be a gift/present emote to signal as well, alot of times new players just stare at my loot bag, look at me, and run away.
---
I like missile launchers in goul hordes. Knocks them around and damages area so you get some of everything. 
---
The gun was probably very smelly lol 
---
Yup that's how I mule without signing out and switching accounts
---
Combat rifle is what you use when you're still too low to use a max-level handmade, and you lack the plans/mods to modify a handmade sufficiently.
---
It's basically inferior in all the ways that matter.  For whatever reason, semi-auto combat rifles have a ridiculous amount of recoil to such a degree that using them with a scope is almost impossible.  But when they're made automatic, the recoil is somehow more controllable. 
---
Thank you for this info! I wasn't aware about the Blackbird paint until long after it was unavailable, and I had no idea of the specific situation until recently.
---
Your theory makes a lot of sense, too. They probably would prefer to cycle shop items to help generate new sales. I just hope that the stuff that went "into the vault" is eventually brought back, even if it was just for a limited time offer. 
---
I did that too. I got a lvl 5 chameleon weightless chest piece off a lvl45 super mutant, so I fixed it up to give and the dude just never came out ever.
---
Personally I prefer the combat. It shoots quickly, reload speed is good, and the damage is still decent
---
That's a warHEAD, alright.
---
I know. I was kicked from the game and never received the reward/plans. Was able to do the quest again and nothing. 
---
Some people just don't think things through.
---
Yeah thats odd. I guess I don‚Äôt have a use for one because a creature dropped me a hardened, recoil compensated handmade with reflex sight.
---
Yeh, that sounds annoying for sure
---
Trusted friend on same server as you. Meet up, either get them to hold what you want to transfer or load up a container. Then you log off  change character, and then rejoin the same server as your friend. That should work. If no friend available, take note of who else is on server and pray they don't disconnect while you change.
---
Is that base damage?  
---
Thats whats I figured. Thanks!
---
Some of the whacky crap I love about this game 
---
Definitely better
---
No problem. 
---
Xbox. That could my issue too :(
---
How do I get the nuke codes and such? Do I have to do all the overseer quests?
---
Is that what that button's meant to do?
---
I settled on the combat. It may not have the highest damage, but it has the highest fire rate, so that made up for it I think. Certainly served me well when I used it 
---
I‚Äôm usually up for it. What‚Äôs your psn and I‚Äôll join
---
I don‚Äôt think so, because I pressed the button and all it did was start shooting of electricity at us
---
Good to know
---
How do I get the nukashine?
---
Been to many queen fights, seen her go down but never in seconds. She's scaled to how many players are there. So you either had a lot of moochers or want doing enough damage. That's a tough ammo sink of a fight though.
---
Stop going to the same spot. They set the timer to 20hrs i think. Just go to New areas.
---
I just think the system is completely pointless and makes the game less fun for absolutely zero reason. 
---
Shouldnt it be considered a rifle with rifle perks affecting it?
---
Also kinda late but always angle the shot and make sure if you're showing of the inside vs outside to adjust sat, contast, etc as needed
---
It can already be one of people didn't destroy camps there.
---
Has nothing to do with levels, the people taking out the SBQ usually have duped weapons that do massive amounts of damage.
---
Yep, felt like that is it's best use. Get a people xp from the buff and get the hell out of Dodge
---
Just throw it and it'll land to sample it's tender meats. But it often flies again after eating it. Enforcer perk makes it land for good though but sucks having to carry a shotgun at all times and swap the perk in just for Scorchbeasts.
---
Sneak is working just fine for me. Maybe try relogging. 
---
Ah. But, you *literally* said the precise opposite of me in your previous comment:
---
I said:
---
&gt; In-game drugs and alcohol are cringe-inducing for most of us non-incels over the age of 15.
---
Which means, in a form, that "Incels and kids under 15 DO NOT find in-game drugs and alcohol to be drug inducing".
---
You stated:
---
Which is 100% opposite of what I'd said and led to our confusion.
---
Yes. I think that anyone who enjoys pretending to imbibe/inhale/injest/inject drugs or alcohol in a video game is either a child or an incel...but I repeat myself.
---
Anywhere in the forest area. If you have the woodchucker perk card (in perception) then you can gather an amazing amount very quickly. 
---
If I'm on a wood run, I put this perk on, go to the vault and work my way down to flatwoods. By the time I get there I've usually amassed enough to last me a good while. Don't forget about the yellow protectrons at the lumber yard down from the vault. There are 3 or 4 of them wandering about the place, interact with them and they should give you some wood too.
---
From memory Ground Pounder is for full auto guns only, so it shouldn't... get a stopwatch and test it and let us know :)
---
Do the quest for Morgantown. It was agreed recently. You will get a recipe that requires quantum and a few easy ingredients . You make it at your brewing table.
---
Coming in late to this discussion.  I've been playing for 3/4 weeks now, and I've done plenty of wandering, covered the whole of the forest, the toxic lands, completed pretty much all there is in the ash heap too.  I'm now doing the Harpers ferry stuff, and have got to the cranberry bog stuff thanks to the big bend tunnel quests.  I feel like ive done a decent proportion of the game.  Yet, i'm a lowly level 36.  
---
I've watched a couple of play throughs and for that amount of quests completed, and also general wandering I reckon I should be nearer level 45-50 by now.  I feel so underpowered in the bog and in the Mire.  I was wondering if I have been doing something wrong! I mean, its not like ive just done the quests, ive tried avoiding them.
---
fissure site prime is the only late game nuke
---
Yeah, I'm a bit put off by his comment as well. I thought we were past making fun of people for mental illness by now.
---
I‚Äôve gotten the same thing with a bunch of cargobots hovering over point pleasant, makes me wonder
---
Absolutely!  But be warned, I hear it is a jungle out there.... just like you might expect during the aftermath of the world....    :-)
---
You can carry whatever you like but if you not able to store 10% of however many your carrying in your stash then your carrying waaaaaayyyyyy to fucking many. 
---
At present you are currently carrying 60 lbs of stimpaks (with Travelling Pharmacy lvl 3). Now even if you have 15 strength and Strong Back level 4 you‚Äôre still effectively using a third of your carry load on stimpacks.  Since like nobody ever has 15 strength and stong back level 4 you probably wadding everywhere because your fecking over-encumbered. 
---
I disagree, i get 3 star legendaries the more places i visit on foot and i get 1-2 weapons a day that are desirable. I'm convinced the more distance you cover on foot- the more you chance for legendaries increase and the more better loot you get.
---
I found that the inability to fast travel offset the XP bonus to such a degree that I level up faster on Adventure mode!  I'd need better fast travel, or more XP bonus, to make Survival worthwhile as an adventurer.
---
they changed that. 
---
I don't really do events unless they are nearby but i never get legendaries from them- my cha is like 3 though so that may be the reason.
---
That would be great
---
Well whats you platform?
---
500. I‚Äôll take it :)
---
Ive only ever seen CAMPs get destroyed that were turret towers messing with the spawns at the golf club. Any other CAMPS there are great.
---
Too low sorry
---
No. Can you even mod on ps4?
---
:D. I know- not sure the exact price but seems like a great weapon
---
Have Excavator lvl 45 and almost a full set of 51b. Have alot of materials and a few mods, and almost 2000 caps, just not flux. What do you charge to mod out a set? 
---
Really that's lame. How do I get better legendarys? 
---
 it's price range from 10k to 20k
---
What do you think it's worth that all I want to know
---
I'm actually making a spreadsheet with all legendary drops i get from Whitesprings. Started doing it 2 days ago and i'm at 250+ legendary items. Obviously most stuff is pure junk.
---
The higher star legendary enemies have higher starred legendary gear.
---
Or you can but stuff on here from the farmers
---
‚ÄòNot sure the exact price‚Äô   ...  But if you want, post on r/market76 and say you are open to offers. Might be a good way to see what the market would actually pay
---
How many and what platform are you on?
---
Maybe another player put them there.
---
Banjo had 54 missiles in stash and needed to make room. Had a missile party at lower level events. Essentially Banjo turned missiles into purified water and stimpacks
---
Are they all 1 star?
---
Sutton station next to Flatwoods right now has the Plan: Signs and Letters 9750 caps.
---
I've been getting better rng since the last patch. I've picked up multiple calibrated shocks, a jet pack mod, a Bloodied The Dragon, and a couple TS guns.
---
Ah rip, i coulda if you were on pc
---
In my current camp, I've got my fusion generator fully enclosed in a little shed so they don't attack it. Where I live there's almost always hostile spawns when I fast travel or load the game. It's stayed alive so far. 
---
Eh its ok.
---
Where on the map IS this bomb anyways?
---
Themegak, if u join quickly. I nuked whitespeings already
---
The Harpoon Gun and Troubleshooter Deathclaw are two but the rest are one, if unhappy am willing to lower price
---
It's a random event spawn. Found it a pricketts cemetery the other day. Did you blow it up?
---
Not unless the player had 8 copies of ‚ÄúWelcome to the Fire Breathers‚Äù
---
Selling it for real money would be illegal, but I'd say you could get 1-1.5k 
---
It‚Äôs hard to control stash for me now because I‚Äôm hoarding all the 2* and 3* items I find until the new legendary vendor bot is available. I only use 2 weapons but I‚Äôm currently loaded. 
---
Mama Dolce's for the flux
---
A few days ago I came across one server that actually deliver items that matched the stars of the mobs, every single one. It‚Äôs just insane to run into a three star creature and have the peace of mind knowing it will deliver a three star item, every single time on a server. I got to keep a few really nice drops. I thought to myself this isn‚Äôt right, it must have been a glitch since we are only supposed to get occasional three star drops from three star mobs. Yep after a couple of hours of play it told me server Maintenance and I got kicked out as expected. 
---
Only problem we've had so far is some asshats coming to a friend's camp and shooting his door down saying they were the Appalachia police and that his fusion generator and purifier were out of code.  They then proceeded to gleefully destroy his camp all the while taunting us to report them because "Bethesda won't do anything".  
---
:D
---
No, it's much more responsible
---
What are the second stars?
---
What is happening when you try to start the quest?  
---
It does fix itself after I relog but it keeps happening and it's obviously quite annoying for a stealth build who relies of sneak damage.
---
Not sure
---
I'd be interested for 10k if you are selling
---
I‚Äôve had multiple of the same
---
Heheh fair enough.  I've been there /done that.  For a minute I thought you were serious, but I understand what you were thinking. 
---
Double barrel ftw, if you can get an instigating shotgun you won the lottery.. 1shit 1 kill what‚Äôs the deal 
---
I click on the "start preparation sequence" option in the terminal, and it does'nt work.
---
sent you a request will come check it out!
---
Wow, looks really beautiful. Wish I could visit but sadly I'm on PC
---
Makes sense
---
Swing speed is the meta for melee right now. I've got a Vampire's SS level 50 that I'll probably sell soon to make space. 
---
I still have yet to find anything that can compete with former one tap weapons
---
Honestly, been called a hacker and duper when players would engage in pvp with me and lose. Ive been playing since beta and if I were any of those I'd have a lot better gear üòÇ
---
Wood chucker is luck I think.  Green thumb is perception.  
---
I havent noticed it being more or less enjoyable. However i have noticed people will send message or Emote to initiate pvp in adventure mode. I had the ammo factory and somebody asked if i wanted to battle over it my team vs theirs. It was actually a fun time!
---
There were also copies of Nukashine recipies with negative amounts
---
I've been farming 3 days and am sitting at 18. The fact it only counts starred legendary enemies is b.s.
---
If next week's challenge is the same. Count me out.
---
No idea mate.
---
Mine is normal. Did you pick up the grounded mutation? That would cut it 50% even with class freak if it's still bugged.
---
TSE is still very powerful, if you're referring to that. I have one - that's my go-to for farming.
---
Is the snow moving? That‚Äôs usually when two textures are conflicting, I got that trying to put fasnacht confetti in my camp on certain surfaces it makes a flashing snow like pattern 
---
That‚Äôs pretty much a god roll for anyone who uses a non Bloodied melee build. I have one and it cuts through mobs like I‚Äôm Thor. Definitely don‚Äôt let it go for less than 10k. I‚Äôd recommend auctioning it off over on r/Market76
---
Yeah, that's a dump stash, people put notes, scrap, ammo, etc in those all the time. 
---
 Ah another Child lost the Faith to the RnGesus. Don't be scared. RnGesus loves everyone and every kind. You just need to find your way back into Randomness and taste the fruit of Probabilities and percentages. The only thing you need todo is pray to our Lord and Savior!  Find your Faith by turning your character in a circle just once, before you deal the killing blow on your juicy 3-Star Legendary and RnGesus will see it.
---
Thank you! 
---
Kk u will add you 
---
Ok, the DCG is +50% limb damage and +30% damage to robots
---
MHG is +33% Vats hit chance and Vats critical will heal you and group.
---
I like it but every time I die I lose 320 caps. It's expensive to play. They need to have the caps loss stop at 100.
---
That is tragic, but not so surprising.   
---
Great! I‚Äôm not playing at the moment but you‚Äôre welcome whenever I am :)
---
Tbh I agree, all the sweaty level 200s went to survival to yoink caps and stimpaks off of innocent level 50s trying to play the game
---
Check your gunpowder.. The weight of it will sneak up on you
---
See big potential? Lol, buddy it's been happening  24/7  since the mode launched. 
---
Finding something good is just really rare, im lvl 275ish and ive had: a tse combat level 40 from uranium fever, an instigating explosive harpoon on the 2nd day of release bcs noone would buy it for 200 caps and it weighed too much (oof the regret) and a mutant slayers explosive dragon that got deleted also 2-3 days after release bcs the server crashed and rolled back to before i got it. Also one unyeilding sentinal armour piece. But yeah i spent like 300 hours just farming for legendaries. 
---
If you really want somethin decent i would recommend trading, its a much better way to get good stuff.
---
Honestly, the worst of the players from what I've seen have stayed in adventure. A lot easier power Trip than survival. 
---
They provided you enough of that balance with their new PvP damage formula that allows lvl 15 pipe pistols to 2-3 shot high level players. That‚Äôs more than you needed and should even get.
---
Sorry that you want to be just as good as people that have put in way more time and effort than you, but that‚Äôs just how the world works kiddo.
---
I'd be down to. Where about would we be building? My IGN is chweneboygaming. Won't be around till Tuesday though.
---
Yeah I loose ammo on ps4 too. Generally try and remember to switch to a melee weapon before login off. 
---
Great idea, I‚Äôve been thinking about doing this a lot for the future c.a.m.p vendor update, making a little town of vending machines. Sadly I‚Äôm on ps4 or I would. 
---
Unfortunately, there will always be people who will actively seek out ways to ruin things for other people.  
---
Awesome! Super glad to hear it, bro! Glad to help, another thing that helps is disabling hardware acceleration in things like Chrome and Discord, frees up GPU memory to focus more on Fallout.
---
I make pocketed or deep pocketed leather studded armor... giving a new player that extra carry weight is a life saver! 
---
If they don‚Äôt have a mic I usually pass them only because they probably think they‚Äôre going to get attacked...lol
---
As far as I know, its RNG, I'm in the same boat as you. I only have a 2-Shot Handmade and Instigating Lever-Action Rifle. Both 1 star. That 2-Shot Shotgun doesn't sound that bad if you rock some Chameleon armor and play sneaky, but that might not be your play style. The best I can say is keep farming. Could also save caps and buy from people, I was thinking of doing the same for a TSE Handmade, just need to save caps and learn where I can buy from. Luck has nothing to do with RNG, as far as I can tell (I have max luck and get around the same drops you do).  
---
\*side note: I get my ass handed by TSE Miniguns and The Dragons, so you're not alone, lol.
---
Hey I'm on PC and looking for one. How much are you asking?
---
Have you run a nuke previously?
---
Thanks for your pointless and presumptuous advice. I and others haven't seen loot respawn for 3 full real-life days in some locations, not from going to the same location over and over again.
---
First off, I am able to fit 10% of my total stimpacks in my stash. 
---
You‚Äôre right about the calculation. I am carrying 60 pounds of stimpacks.
---
However I have 12 strength, Traveling Pharmacy level 3 and Strong Back level 4. 
---
But I‚Äôm not over-encumbered as even without any power armor, I have 325 carry capacity and I am sitting at  201 pounds including all my 600 stimpacks, tons of other aid, full armor set and several weapons. And I still have 124 pounds left worth of junk I can pick up. So I am nowhere near over-encumbered. Not to mention that if I get in my excavator, my carry capacity goes up to 480 without the extra weight glitch. At that point my stimpacks take up only 1/8th of my total carry capacity. 
---
I think it is because people don‚Äôt always kill you.
---
Yeah, I did it without problems. Like I said, I'm on the very end and I can't start the prep.
---
Ah sorry have all of those but on PC
---
Its not out yet is it? Havent checked the game in a couple of days so it depends on the quest for it i guess. Or was it the first one for killing legendaries? I did that but dont remember what i got
---
Yes and no for me, people can still pick up your junk and not get a bounty.
---
Very nice :)
---
I've been looking at weapons on Ebay but I don't want my account banned.  Found a nice 3 star TSE handmade.
---
I believe it comes out on the 2nd. I guess once it drops we can negotiate a price
---
Do you have Missile Silio Holotape, worth always checking that before doing a nuke run. Might be that the silo you are in launched within the last 3 hours.
---
I definately would not go for anything off of ebay. I assume you probably wouldnt get banned but i think it is bannable, could be wrong though. You can get tse handmades on pc for like 10kish caps anyway
---
I've never been griefed. I figured with my camp's extreme proximity to Fort Defiance and Watoga I would have more player traffic. The only player I've seen near my camp waved to me and dropped me some random camp plans.
---
To that end, I've only seen one player get hostile without provocation in the time I've been playing, and that was to a teammate. He killed him, but seemed only to want to kill him. He waved at me lol. A couple players shot at me for sleeping in their beds, but it was my first session and I didn't know what a camp was or how to tell it was one back then.
---
All in all, the players I've encountered have all been pretty good to play with. One high level at whitespring even ran with me through there and let me get in a few shots on each enemy before owning them. 
---
Are you willing to buy ?
---
Not gonna lie, was expecting this post to be about the cheaters that glitch into the rocks and use it to get high survival times.
---
Love my quad/explosive double barrel for 'general use'.
---
Cheap as chips to run - ammo goes a long way and it degrades way slower than any other of my shotguns.
---
I loathe being tethered to the gunpowder/lead/plastic cycle so the combat and pump-action are situational, this one is the one that sees most of the action.
---
But the quest worked perfectly, until this moment.
---
Too bad stealthboy mk3s don‚Äôt work and why mention chameleon if you‚Äôre using a stealthboy lol.
---
When I do find people who have weapons I want, they always crank it to 25000 caps.  They never negotiate.
---
What time?
---
There‚Äôs snow on floor and little flakes falling 
---
Sure thing, what sort of cap range were you thinking? 
---
Ohh OK so that's why it was cut 50%, thought the Class Freak would help but nope. Thanks for the info.
---
I like it! I was going to build up there but I was having a heck of a time trying to find a place for my corn. If only there were indoor planters. 
---
Now we need an ultra hardcore mode for those of us who are like suffering
---
Very cool!
---
Sure they went to war with farming implements, but they weren't idiots either, if they would have known there will be fighting they would have had their local blacksmith adjust the blade to stick straight up from the pole and remove the extra handles at the very least. Believe it or not, you can't just train yourself to be as lethal with a rubber ducky as someone can be with a halberd.
---
I'd think that expanding the locations would make more sense overall. Seems like the train stations make pretty obvious choices - there's 12 of them. Add in the Vault (or even Vaults) and other vendor locations (Harper's Ferry and Watoga Super Duper Mart) and you're at 18 or so. One would think even the most dedicated camper would eventually sour on those odds.
---
It should also be relatively simple for the system to favor spawn points away from other players. 
---
Of course, they've already built a randomized spawn system into the game for NukaShine - using the same for Survival should be pretty trivial.
---
I find it more laggy now than anything 
---
Learn to prioritize and make sacrifices - i do, the game feels super strict and lacking flexabilty.
---
More point- fuck yes
---
99% of the tse‚Äôs womt be sold for caps.. at least on pc where duping is not much a problem anymore. Most people want trades for end game weapons. 
---
I built my base here on a normal server and found more often than not that I spawn inside the rocks and thought about how people could do that in survival and how that would suck running around never being able to find them.
---
And to what extent should it be allowed?  Fallout is not a peaceful world and in such their should be some awful villains.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what the balance might be.
---
*Well I ain't superstitious and I don't get suspicious* but I guess I could give it a try.
---
I would use DB if I got a quad+limb damage one
---
I would just try keep looking at new postings for people selling them. Generally if you post trying to buy theyll go higher but ive seen them go as low as 8k. Honestly though i feel if you offer 15 you should be able to find one fairly fast. 25k also isnt too bad to get if you sell a bunch of 3 stars for maybe a couple thousand each and maybe a bit more for bloodied or instigating. You can get a decent amount by clearing west tek and server hopping for a few hours (thats how i farm) and doing any horde events in the mire or bog, or awol armaments that you see
---
What general area are you thinking? Sounds fun.
---
I did a test recently and I could not put my camp very close to another even though it was well outside the build area of the camps. I wish they would fix that.
---
Okay well where may I find those enemies? And how can I sell/buy legendarys? 
---
I found a level 45 Quad crossbow which is really fun to use on trash mobs but is too slow unfortunately, too bad there are no mods. Looks kind of funny when he loads 4 bolts into the same chamber
---
Sure, I could always just buy one, but it probably won't feel the same as if I grinded and found it on my own.
---
I agree, apparently you can build nearly anything on top of a fire in game, but I don't like the broken immersion aspect that has. I try to keep my C.A.M.P.s "all natural".
---
The explosive launcher heavy weapons are really only useful when you know you're going to be targeting massed enemies, like defending the Monongah power plant.
---
It does help that I am not a low level; however, I still avoid most players unless they are looking to trade.
---
You can normally spot the ones looking to be malicious.  Plus I‚Äôve dropped off a server once or twice because of Greifers.  
---
It seems better than it was a patch or two ago but still is a little buggy at times.
---
Whitesprings golf club for legendaries and fantastic loot, Fissure Site Prime for a boss fight and a 3 star legendary, and Vault Tec University for XP
---
Nice theory but I don't believe any of it since you did not provide any data and my personal experience is different.
---
I was thinking around 500-600 caps. It could change depending on the challenge to get it
---
Join the trading sub reddit.  You can check out YouTube videos for legendary farming
---
Yeah no i totally agree, but thats so insanely rare is the issue. I think your best chance is to start collecting all the 3 stars you find, try buy weightless 3 stars and stuff and horde them
---
all for the legendary vendor, thats what ive been doing
---
Okay, you do you! 
---
But as a final parting shot I must say about 200 stimpaks should last you a fortnight so you should never get to the point you‚Äôll even need that many. 
---
Add gt:shadyrebob if you are on xbox. We can join up
---
I hang around Flatwoods &amp; give all players lvl5 or under 50 diluted stimpaks. Then I go off &amp; kill the ghouls at whitespring :) 
---
yep... Until the moment you actually tried to start the launch. You can get in and work your way there just fine, but if the missile hasn't been rebuilt then the launch prep won't initiate.
---
Nuke zones last for what an hour?, Missiles take 3 to build. so even though there may be no sign of a nuke zone in your session, one or even all of the silo's may be unusable. *Always* check the holotape first. If you don't have one, you can buy one from the armoury in the Whitespring Bunker. 
---
I have yet to try Survival, but that's a pain. Spawning is the hardest part about this location... I land "inside" the rocks a lot and have to spawn down on the road then climb up.
---
Have you had it since beta? I got 4 really early on my first character from some event I have never seen again, might have been removed from the game
---
Playing Nuka tapper atm.
---
Ah ok idk then. If its easy probably but i normally do a ton of queen fights (10+) a day and each give 200 caps so to me 600 isnt rly that much. If it is fairly easy tho sure.
---
I get this all of the time. I had no idea I was actually losing ammo. Wonder how much I‚Äôve lost...
---
Heh, I killed myself literally on the first shot i ever fired from an auto grenade launche...damn thing is malicious.  
---
Welcome. I really enjoyed the little things like the tools sign lol
---
Whitesprings golf club and Watoga high school will spawn Legandary every time. And the event in Watoga high will start over if you dont leave spawning more.
---
Hmm, too bad for me I guess. Thanks.
---
RNG is a fickle bitch...i'm 140 and I haven't gotten a single "god tier" item. Other people get them every other play through. The loot system in this game is badly in need of re-balancing. 
---
yeah, there's a lot to be said about these situations, sometimes people think they've been one-shot killed but on the attackers side they've hit multiple times and the server tick lumps it all together for the "shootee". Bethesda don't do a very good job of explaining the rules and mechanics of the game and players aren't the best for actually finding out info themselves either so we get people thinking other players are cheating.
---
I like to help players when I can, but I have to be careful because I have been attacked just for waving at someone
---
Sell some items on the trade subreddits. 
---
Yw. Great view from the top :)
---
LMFAO
---
Yes but I can‚Äôt fit the other 400 in my stash because the weight reduction perk only applies when you‚Äôre carrying them. 
---
Yeah actually, most of my legendaries that I horde are all under a weight of 4 or 5.  That 3 star rolling pin I mentioned only weighs 1.4 if I remember correctly.
---
They don‚Äôt work from the favorite wheel for me or anyone I know. Try again.
---
Take your aid with you and equip pharmacy perks. Ditch/sell/vendor every weapon and armor you dont use or have a better one. Transfer stuff you dont use to your alt (via friend). Build ammo and equip banderoller perk. Make sure you have scrapped all junk.
---
&gt;&gt; general rule: if you dont use it, lose it
---
Your previous post made me start logging all the legendary drops i get. So far i'm at 250 or so, mostly junk tho. Planning on making a nice loot breakdown when i get to 1000. 
---
I only entered the data from 191 items in my spreadsheet, and i still have about 50-60 screenshots to go through. 
---
&gt;If you have a low level/weak legendary, most of the loot will be the same kind of that legendary
---
I'm not seeing the same behavior. 
---
&gt;If you have no armor, you will be literally submerged in armor pieces.
---
I've always used PA, with no armor. So far i have 91 Weapons, 100 Armors (13 wood 15 Robot, 24 Leather, 8 Marine, 14 Combat, 14 Trapper, 10 Metal, 7 Raider). Weapons are pretty evenly distributed.
---
181 x 1*
---
7 x 2*
---
3 x 3*
---
3 x Syringer.
---
Anyway, still a long way to go until i reach the 1000 mark
---
I notice stupid thing about sniper rifle- It's bullet case ejection hole and receiver handle (idk if this is correct name in english) are on wrong side. Normally if weapon is shouldered on right shoulder, it is good to have these things on right side as then bullet case comes out and flies past from shooter. On left side you might get hit with case. If receiver handle on right side, it also means that bullet is reloaded while gun is shouldered. Right now inside the game when you reload new bullet, shooter takes gun off the shoulder and then reload, what has really started to bother me, because it covers my view in first person and looks stupid.
---
Agreed.
---
It sucks, but now you know :) Give it time and practice and if it ever happens again you'll be in a place where you can shrug it off and just go launch from a different silo.
---
A bit of work and practice and you can launch a nuke, alone in about 20 minutes. 
---
And drop us inside the building &lt;3
---
Luck has absolutely nothing to do with RNG drops. I had ONE point of luck and ONE point of charisma when I got my first explosive weapon, a laser gun and the second, a Bloodied explosive pump shotgun. It‚Äôs all random. 
---
One thing I‚Äôve found out is that the legendary effects come in batches. Sometimes I get several Nocturnal, sometimes several Junkies in a row. If you like them, great, if not, log out and change server. It‚Äôs as if each server has a small pool of items assigned to them, change server if you don‚Äôt like what you get because that‚Äôs probably all you‚Äôre gonna get if you stay on it. 
---
It‚Äôs actually two random spawns in one. 
---
The bomb and dead greaser are two different events. 
---
What I'm getting here is if you've ever attacked another player you're an asshole. 
---
Bump.
---
@bethesda
---
Oh really. That's even cooler than.
---
There's an wasy way to know. If you see someone selling a bunch of legendary hunting rifles the duping is probably back. Legendary hunting rifles didnt exist before the big patch that removed duped items.
---
Some motherfuckers always trying to ice skate uphill.
---
got it today. had to server hop to get the outfit, mask was there first time.
---
Thanks dude.
---
Have a solid clan?  Looking to join a clan for the new group dungeon.
---
There are several locations for random encounters. Each one can spawn one of quite a few different things. 
---
The two spots I know are just south west of the Overseers Camp and on the spot where the Highway 65 sign is on the map (east side of map). 
---
I got max lvl bloodied/swing speed/+strength Meat hook once on PC. Everything else has been carbige tho.
---
I guess we're in the same, crappy boat.
---
If I vist your CAMP I will always leave a propaganda flyer.  I keep a ton on me at all times.
---
Take your time in adventure mode, read notes and terminals and explore√∂. There is no rush to get to 50. Most of the endgame is grinding and redoing content you have already done before so don't be in a hurry to get there before you explore appalachia :)
---
events
---
If you haven't got to the bottom of it, it works like aiming with a rifle once you've equipped the binoculars. I have about 3 pairs at the moment, you don't get anything for scrapping them.
---
LOL. I just added the Tesla coil mod to my excavator. I wasn't really sure what it was but I found it in a vendor's list so snapped it up. Thing is, I also have the "Electrically charged" mutation, so the next time a ghoul bumped into me he basically exploded... I would love a griefer to try the same.
---
"There is another place that need to be nuked. I'll show in your map" :V
---
Ah nice, ive been putting ultra light mods on armour and keeping it, not too many weapons though
---
Wow
---
Lot has been sold
---
Come pay me a visit with my reactive plates electrically charged unstable isotope trifecta.  That might be fun. 
---
I hear there are some neighborhoods in real life like that too!  
---
There is some realism for everyone!
---
But Sorry you got attacked
---
Adventure Mode is Canada and Survival Mode is Vietnam 
---
awesome.
---
If you build at Twin Lakes, one can build on each lake. I have "neighbors" I can see quite often. 
---
Good tip know
---
That is a question we all have to ask ourselves
---
I know I think about it when a workshop I want is owned
---
 I‚Äôm short 10 most of the 15 I got so far have been between watoga and ammo factory just running back and forth 
---
I prefer my hazmat suits damaged.
---
Very nice.
---
I can't wait until we get the player vending in game. I really want to interact with other players and buy stuff.
---
I just killed them and left. 
---
About once a day if not more. Depending on the number of scorched beasts. 
---
Fanboys in denial
---
Only the best Hazmat suits wear only the bare necessities
---
You and me both!  Next week it drops!  (9 Apr)
---
I know in real life, a wendigo is supposed to be someone who has feasted on human flesh.
---
Wait!
---
Can we go back to "who moves the muppets"?
---
Currently I'm up in the mountains and might remain for a while (found an acid vein) hit me up tuesday and ill send ya the exact location!
---
Thank you :)
---
Eating of human flesh. 
---
Not necessarily, but there are a whole lot of jerks who are off the regular servers now. 
---
If you don't enjoy pvp, don't enjoy random idiots wrecking your camp, don't enjoy watching teams gang up on solo players that are minding their own business, think it's wrong for high level players to follow low level players around, taunting them, and don't like that even passive players can be one shot killed, then the new beta servers are very much appreciated. 
---
I keep one launcher and a few missiles but dont know why. The fatman is useful for softening up a target location with a lot of enemies from a distance.  Like artillery.  I also use the fatman to deal with bullies. They tend to leave you alone after catching a nuke in the face and having their corpse looted
---
I have full sentinel assassin, I use dodgy, fireproof 3, barbarian, evasive, nerd rage, and serendipity. So trust me when I say you can die, and very easily. 
---
I think you're right, I noticed this too. It's even faster with speed demon and ground pounder but I can't say I have 100% proof.
---
&gt;This would be pretty great. I still don't have my own PA station, so fast traveling in, fixing my PA, then going outside for the nuke could be nice. It would also kill the meta of building camps nearby.
---
For future reference, just fast travel to Blackwater Mine and use the PA station there instead. You might have to kill a few mole miners, but at least that area is almost never in the blast zone.
---
If you don't want to go there, FT to Arktos, go around the back to the loading docks, and follow the path on top of the trucks to the second floor. There's a PA station behind a level 1 terminal, and the most you have to deal with is level 10-15 scorched. 
---
Well for now I'm located up in the good ole mountains of west virginia (near the dog on the map) There's an acid vein right on the spot which saves my ass lmaooo
---
One thing to bear in mind, when you view the weight of an item in your stashbox, it isn;t telling you how much it weighs *in your stashbox* it is saying how much it would weigh if you were carrying it, which whatever weight reduction perks you may have.
---
This is about the hardest part of inventory management. 
---
One trick is to learn what junk you need to keep some of and what you can afford to sell. I aim to keep 3 bulk of everything aside from any items I regularly use (leather, springs, steel, lead etc.,) those I will keep 5-10 depending on the item. The loose junk that you can sell, I tend to keep 50 of each (circuits, screws, ballistic fibre etc.,)
---
Different builds are going to have different problems. My melee character is light and streamlined as all hell. Runs around with zero weight reduction perks and he is still only running a carry weight of 65 or so and a stash running at about 300. Melee is easy to maintain.
---
My Ballistic build has a heavier stash due to the volume of lead and steel I need to find. I tend not to bulk either of them and use them up for ammo when I can to keep the stash light.
---
Be sure to check your stash/inventory for Ores, they can weight you down, they are worth finding the acid for and smelting then bulking and/or selling. 
---
Try not to put too many chems and food in your stash, firstly food will degrade faster in the stash and also everything will weigh a lot more in there than on your person if you have Travelling Pharmacy or Thru-Hiker.
---
Soup. I'll say it again. Soup, that's all you really need in this game to keep your hunger and thirst under control. I have a handful of corn growing and make corn soup before I head out, everything else I sell. I keep 3 stimpaks and 10 diluted on me, sell the rest. I sell ALL Rad-x and most of my Radaway.
---
How did you angle the walls?
---
Holy bat droppings Batman!
---
I always have to reload my pistols on log in- amount missing is random 1 - 5 bullets (pipe revolver) but I have never monitored my max carried at log off then log on.
---
I must now inspect this &amp; start making complaints if this is factual.
---
It stretches a little bit more west than in the game and as is always the case the relative proportions are different, but yes it is a very small town.  
---
That‚Äôll teach‚Äôem to be jerks
---
Okay then do you have something to support it? Because playing as female, I‚Äôve never felt it‚Äôs difficult to see junk. In fact, I‚Äôm constantly battling my storage being full.
---
I love Savage divide if that's where it is, it reminds me of my home state of Oregon.
---
I have no idea. I keep getting bits and pieces of silo codes and they keep expiring on me cos I can never find all the pieces or something 
---
The balance is that if you want that, go play the beta pvp. 
---
I'm lv 41
---
i found all the regular pieces but if you have the heavy parts sure
---
How  can you build so much... My Camp is full, has no turrets and only one floor.

Do you want to add level matchups, set weapons, and no perks to number 3?
---
Very nice, where is this located?
---
More stable. If you didn‚Äôt like the gameplay then you won‚Äôt like it anymore now tho
---
Literally im located to the left of the dog near relay tower lw-b1-22
---
Agreed, but I don't know entirely if he was critting me or not. I was spamming stims and nuka for regen. Thats what's broken.
---
Its such a good spot lmaooo
---
okay i‚Äôll check it out
---
But am I wrong? If a sarcastic insult is your only defence, maybe you just have a poor argument?
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
I'm totally against briefing but that is pretty funny. "Out of code" lol. Were they dressed as police or park ranger/wildlife officers?
---
Its such a quaint spot x3
---
I stumbled on the event, yes it triggers there. I did not get a recipe and kept wondering what I was supposed to do with the seeds.
---
It's a statement
---
Check your junk. It can really quickly raise up and be problem.  Realized one day I had over 6k in wood and steeel.  
---
They might. Maybe survival is more their style
---
I carry over 200 stims at a time so to each their own i guess.
---
could be good for leveling up an alt character
---
Prickets for 
---
If this isn‚Äôt a troll post.....
---
Excavator is incredible when it comes to mining. I didn‚Äôt realize that until I followed a poster‚Äôs suggestion and went to lucky hole mine for lead. Just one trip and I had to dump a bunch of stuff from my stash to make room for the lead it produced. 
---
Screws and gears 
---
Ahhh of course
---
South west from Watoga. The last picture in the album is a screenshot of the map :)
---
I thought it was the tv dinner trays not the cafeteria ones
---
This game still exists?
---
It should also be noted that there is no real disadvantage to mixing and matching different sets, except for the Excavator. You can still get the extra materials when mining if you just use the arms, but the extra carry weight requires the whole set.
---
Yep, random instances of you can't sneak for crap &amp; now those mutants or glowing 95 death claws will punish you.
---
Now if someone taught me to farm violet flux. Everyone‚Äôs nuking whitesprings which have none of it
---
Was there yesterday. No weirdness. Run a file check?
---
Well, I feel like perks could stay, if they are very close in level, they can choose a basic weapon from each of the catagories that the perks cover (Shotguns, heavy weapons, explosives, etc.) And they should each have full light combat armor. (For balanced protection)
---
Without the perk?
---
That'd equate to over 200 pounds of weight in your inventory. Are you using a full set of Food/Drink/Chem weight reduction armor or living in Excavator PA?
---
Peak comedy
---
Personally I think it‚Äôs a person who is becoming a ghoul but has just completely lost their mind. Like they just repeat words for no reason like the scorched, eat people because why not, and when they turn feral I guess the mutation is taken to the extreme contorting their bodies into something terrifying.  
---
It‚Äôs theorized that some cryptids come from west Tek. There is a terminal that talks about a few different test specimens, and they sound different than super mutants.
---
But it sounds like wendigos are different. radiation plus a lot of radiated cannibalized flesh equals wendigo. There is even a quest that shows the end result. 
---
What's the reward?
---
Check how many lights you have... Lights alone take up a lot of budget apparently. Although I've maxed out the lights because of the neon sign. Maybe move your camp and when you place it back down you can "clean" out unnecessary items. My last camp was only five foundation squares on one floor and almost full budget because all the unnecessary decorative items I had.
---
Oh duh, if I actually looked at the pics I would‚Äôve seen that! Haha
---
How about like arenas and we get a set amount of perk points and set perk cards we can choose to put where we want? And we get to choose from a variety of basic weapons and try to win like that. Like a gladiator ring.
---
I havent seen a reactive plate mod any place yet
---
Oh wow. Second one is great!
---
One of the trays. You're probably right
---
no need. I run traveling pharmacy, bandolier, batteries included etc. I don't have have ammo, armor, aid, or weapon in my stash. keep in mind im mainly a PVE player so I don't go in survival often
---
Neither, they could have at least had the decency to dress the part.  
---
First radstorm for me was confusing I thought someone dropped a nuke while I was playing the one nuka cola game on my pip boy and fast traveled to vault 76 to see clouds of rads and I had no clue what happened
---
Vyvyan! Stop trying to blow up the bomb!
---
You can also run like the wind for a REALLY long time before you blackout.
---
Whoops. replied to the wrong comment.
---
I know it‚Äôs just one of the few, but I can just throw you a hard lemonade if you want! 
---
Nuking prime, watoga, some parts of the mire and the toxic valley yields incredible high amount of raw violet. You can farm them and use hardened mass (junk), high radiation fluids (aid) and glowing mass (aid) to stabilize them. Completing nuking fissure prime and defeating the queen also yields some amount of random flux (including violet) as well. Or, you can always go to market subs and trade for some
---
Considering how much of an obsession Beth has for weapons of the Wehrmacht I was impressed when I realized the Flaregun doesn't have it's anti-tank attachment.
---
Drink to survive and survive to drink ;)
---
Use tenderizer AND lone wanderer. Everything dies even quicker. As for weight reduction, totally unnecessary with management (i.e don't be a hoarder).
---
I do the event are Morgantown airport pretty much daily as I swing through there for some easy ammo off the scorched and the event starts every time I get to that end of the airport but I'm always doing it alone, like people joined I think three times so far and I know for a fact iv done it like 80 times lol. Easy xp and free loot
---
If you had [Magic Carpet Ride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4WiyxXpyZc) playing in the background during this, you're a god :)
---
They've worked when used in that fashion for me. It's too bad your experience has been otherwise, not my problem.
---
For PVP. I just use another character and run like 10 super stims at most due to survival rules. specifically dropping random amount of aid items
---
For the arenas we could have higher risk for bets as the weapons get deadlier and the more perks are added.
---
You can get just about any weapon you want for it 
---
You don't actually need a full set of codes to launch a nuke. The codes reset every week and they're the same for everyone so a lot of people just wait for that week's to be decoded. All you really need is a nuclear keycard 
---
Did you give your account a regrettable name?
---
I have a farm in the mire but regularly go and give low-level players some modified guns and hard to find building supplies along with a healthy stock of water and food
---
I'm a PC player too, although I don't know how many hours I've put in off the top of my head.
---
I've never been attacked/killed by another player. I've only run into other players maybe 4 or 5 times, and they've just ignored me altogether every time.
---
How do I get that?
---
Give that to an alt or something and try to see what happens when you get a negative amount of caps
---
LOL, you seem like you'd be real fun to play with
---
You dont have an argument because you arent a coder for Bethesda. You know nothing about their game or their servers on their side. You are saying it's a fact the game will break as if you *know personally*. Are you secretly a Bethesda employee? Are you personally coding for them and their game? Maybe you should be quiet. 
---
No seriously trying to farm watoga getting legendaries but that‚Äôs what I get along with a vampiric pump lvl5 and furious Gatling lvl20
---
I've just now tested it again and it works just fine.
---
sure, but if you play Xbox One X for 3 years, that's $180 of xbox live gold, which with that money you could've gotten a better platform.
---
I think we just need more points. Fallout 4 was great cause you could have all the perks. Yes it took a long time to level up that far but I dont see why 76 cant have the same setup besides whiners complaining other players are too strong
---
If you‚Äôre saying you think Fast Travel breaks immersion - yep, right there. Super free more ubiquitous fast travel is even worse, even more candy instead of meat.
---
I‚Äôd much rather see an event to get the trains running, and fast travel along some specified train routes, etc. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like to see with rebuilding ... so yeah ... even free-r, more ubiquitous fast travel is more useless candy.
---
I had a server disconnect the first time I ever drank the nukashine so I never even got to see the blackout. Just ended up back outside the frat house when I logged back in
---
F***ing pinned! Amazing work baron!
---
&gt;Have a problem with stealth? Take anti stealth measures. Use mentats to make them visible and shoot sentinel with a Tesla rifle. They will move. Shoot Cav with a cryolatot. Kill melee with shotguns. Everything has a counter y‚Äôall just too lazy to do the work to counter people. Have a problem with explosive weapons? Get better armor with dense torso and use fireproof and you negate  mostly all of their dmg.
---
You are basically saying that all you gotta is have  five different builds at once.  To be effective with a cryolator your build needs to be heavy weapons focused, to be effective with a shot gun it needs to be shot gun focused, etc.   You are speaking as if it's possible to have a build that will counter all other builds. 
---
It's not 
---
I mean you aren't wrong, but is Fallout 76 a *Massive* multiplayer online game? I don't see the same formulas of most MMOs applying well to this game but to each their own
---
You said every asset, which I read as every asset IN THE GAME. I apologize if I was mistaken, there. And as I said, there are far too many moving parts and complex structures and large objects in.The Fallout 4 settlement system that just wouldn't work or would possibly affect stability. You act as though Bethesda is the paragon of testing, yet the game has bugs that have persisted since birth.
---
Static assets work differently to player assests and. The cool veranda-tyoe-half-wall-things that the shack in Charleston works differently to one you would build in the Starlight Drive-In.
---
I couldn't agree more about MORE settlement objects and a wider freedom of _where_ you can build, which would definitely encourage more creativity and immersive buildings.
---
My point? Did you not read anything I typed?
---
They didn't advertise this as rebuilding America. Vault-Tec did. Todd never said we would rebuild America. The point is that America's best and brightest wanted to rebuild America,they tried their darndest, but they inevitably failed. 
---
Imagine you're a level one plAyer, you find a CAMP full of living, breathing humans, unaffected by the Scorch Plague. You recall the Overseer saying everyone is dead and begging you to risk your life to help her make it so the disease is contained to Appalachia. And you think "lmao nah, look at all these thriving towns, the game's ALREADY COMPLETED, I'm gonna just chill".
---
If people who are not inoculated can just waltz in and settle down, then the Plague wasn't actually a threat in the first place. If the people come from the Vaults then they'd still lack inoculation and either succumb to what remains of the Plague or flee Appalachia. If you were to inoculate them via a quest, then they'd probably build their own settlements, rather than settle down in yours.
---
The game won't change in such a way that ruins it for new players. Other changes, big and small are always underway.
---
Nope just that I had the in game make one instead of putting my main one in. Just wanted to play.
---
People don‚Äôt hate a game for the sake of it, fallout 76 was and still is a graphically outdated, boring and broken game that I personally couldn‚Äôt bring myself to complete even after sinking hundreds of hours into the previous titles. 
---
Killed myself a couple of times with scatter mod on explosive laser rifle trying to kill a legendary 
---
Nuclear keycards are carried by cargo bots that fly around the map escorted by a couple vertibots. You can find them just exploring, or one of the factions (don't wanna spoil if you aren't that far) has a terminal that lets you track em down. For what it's worth I see them pretty often in the cranberry bog
---
Thanks, I'll try to do that! BUT my biggest issue is FEAR &amp; ANXIETY of "something" always coming to get me üòÆ...and they're fast! I just want to stroll around some and explore and read and listen and learn. In the Vault we were all "the best &amp; brightest" right? But I was the best at the reading and investigating, not combat and killing monster mutants--don't you remember?   üòÇ
---
This is my new character so I must have picked it up thinking it was a can.
---
Weighing them down so easier to hunt smart 
---
Iv put In a lot of hours. They balanced it on the low end but not the high end. I have 3 pieces of assassins, dense chest, fireproof, 75 additional hp from vodka and I still get one shotted by tse. The high end pvp is just abunch of tse weapons. Dont have one? Your screwed.
---
I'm with this model of stash management.  If you can't use it sell or scrap it. I hoard nothing, I'm rarely unencumbered, my stash has tons of room.  
---
Correct now i think about it!
---
I have a Lv. 40 Vampire's Super Sledge that I found at a vendor with the +40% swing speed.  Having that, plus Martial Artist Rank 3, is pretty comical to watch. üòÇ
---
Fierce 
---
I know, it‚Äôs just anything but whitesprings is almost never got nuked and I‚Äôm too lazy to complete the quest to pick my drop zone. And since the survival mode was released the nukes are fewer in general on Xbox. At least in my experience 
---
Exactly the opposite. Paying for fast travel breaks immersion, because there is no transit system. There are no cars. You are paying for the privilege of not walking the exact same twenty minute hike again, with nothing to do, and THAT part of the mechanic is fucking moronic. 
---
Fast travel has been in every fallout game. Originally, because it wasn't an open world game, so you had to have some system to get from quest area/city/etc to quest area/city/etc. Fast travel _belongs_ in fallout games, if they ever have one without _any_ fast travel system, that's probably the first one I don't play. 
---
The only issue I have with bethesda's fast travel system for 3 and 4 (before that fucking garbage survival system in 4...) was that they didn't bother including the random encounters. In this one, it's that plus the idiotic  cap tax of fast travel fees. 
---
I think it's fucking mindbogglingly stupid to expect people to walk from point-a to point-b every single time in a fucking video game map this size. I don't have time for that, most people don't have time for that. 
---
I'd love to see that as a system, fix the train network? Sign me u p. Hoard that pre-war money because it's useful again. 
---
Gift it to a newbie its RnGsus l watching to see what you do
---
See thats the thing. Its a legit game dynamic. But its also cheap AF to spawn farm the train stations and events with a low level character.  U lose 2x your level in caps. They use a low level secondary just high enough for their main characters high powered cast offs and they farm spaen point with little to lose if they do get nicked.
---
If u wanna bring it have the balls to bring it with some real stake in the game.
---
If u wanna bring ypur low level alt have the balls to bring what your low level may have legitimatly found
---
Yeah my hunting rifle tears through mobs if I'm stealthed. My build is rifle/unarmed with max stealth. The problem for me is when my cover is blown the hunting rifle feels unviable when I'm being rushed. I was going to use the combat rifle for these situations but it feels very weak. I have 10 luck and have barely seen a legendary lol
---
Should auto get recipe when you get the seeds I think.
---
Wowzers this is epic
---
Would greatly appreciate it. Will be on around 7 est. 
---
??? PlayStation 4
---
Fair enough
---
No way of changing your user name as of now. I‚Äôm sure they will implement a way to change your user name eventually now that so many people are playing a game where it actually matters. I made mine a long time ago for the mod support didn‚Äôt think it would ever be an IGN that would be displayed. 
---
I'm ps4 I will let u kno
---
A legendary weapon with an unique name 
---
Maybe but I doubt it if they wanted a shooter they could play apex. 
---
I know that, I mean within the lore of the fallout world
---
Hahaha, so true. I had a total stranger pop in from survival mode and ask me to claim the bounty. So far i have seen less insane twaffles trying to gank me just because or destroy my camp for what ever reason.
---
Alright cool just message me, MrExceptionz.
---
This clears it, thanks!
---
I do the same thing. My issue is if I fuck up and get caught, the hunting rifle doesn't feel very viable in direct combat. I mean, I'm a crack shot stealth sniper so I never get caught but.....eh lol still 
---
If you end up in WS nuke zones utilize them by farming other materials (mass etc.) and when you get into a good watoga nuke, you would be able to gather over 100 raw fluxes with green thumb perk. 
---
That, I have no info, lol. Sorry dude.
---
It'd be nice to have some sort of agricultural questline where you can learn plans for growbeds that can mimic the growing conditions for the specific plants/crops that require being in certain areas on the map.
---
It has been really nice and semi-peaceful
---
Yeah if I can find a level 50 one lol
---
I have one but have no clue what it's for and it has a quest diamond next to it so I cant use it for anything ir drop it tho it has no weight
---
Cryolators are good for one major thing: freezing the Scorchbeast Queen.  I don't know if Two-Shot implies you'll freeze her faster, but if 2-3 players come to an SBQ battle with enough Cryo Cells, you're *going* to beat her.  It's good to have the Crystallizing Barrel on it for both range and efficiency - it lobs ice projectiles when you do, instead of the weird flamethrower-ish thing it normally does.
---
I'm specced for non automatic rifles though. Sad face
---
Do I also have to change home xbox settings like they described above? Just starting up fallout 76 keeps opening the prompt to buy xbox live gold...
---
I just want to unlink the Bethesda account that I have now that's attached to my Xbox to my real one.
---
When there were a lot more low levels. I handed out ammo and purified water to many. Couple nights ago I saw some low levels exploring and trying to fight mobs. I came to help them just in time too as one almost died. Nothing major but that's it. I also wave at every single player I see. Sometimes I even run them down just to give them a wave. Oh and I scared a lower level player the other night while he was killing a super mutant. I jumped out at him in my power armor and he freaked and shot me. Then immediately did a heart. That one was wholesome for me. A good wholesome laugh!
---
Leave server? Lol 
---
Throw on a targeting computer. Target something, turn towards friend, fire and laugh as they freak out with the missile curving over their head to hit the target.
---
In fo4, with console commands, you could get a targeting computer on a mini gun or sawed off too. 8 rockets at once, or 500 in quick succession, curving through the sky on a mission to ruin someone's day. 
---
Just send me a friend request when you can. I‚Äôll be on like an hour after that &amp; will shoot u a message when I‚Äôm on!! l3ULLY_xKINGx (first character is a lowercase L lol) 
---
9/10 Wholsome indeed
---
I'm down, level 87 what do I need to do.
---
you mean welded rebar reflects 100% of damage and you take none?? that cant be right
---
I disagree on just about every point. I think it‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs definitely not broken and the graphics are fine. The weather effects in this game are among the best. Maybe it‚Äôs not for you but it‚Äôs hard to see the reasoning if you enjoyed every other fallout because this is essentially just like all the other fallouts but online. The only thing missing is quest that have choice and consequences but guess what that‚Äôs what the wastelander update is all about. 
---
Online games aren‚Äôt easy to make but they remain the most successful over time due to the large amount of content that is added after launch to keep them fresh. Fallout 76 will be no exception and I predict it will actually go above and beyond other online games due to the simple fact of how dynamic the world is and that it‚Äôs build on random chance and encounters in a huge world that‚Äôs packed full of enemies, weapons, interesting places to see and fun events to take part in and that is only the base game. 
---
I think the vendor in Grafton sells all the excavator mods.
---
Lumber yards. There's one south of Vault 76 that I know of. Helvetia can give you over 100 in one go. There's also a lumber yard in the east, I've read. I haven't been there though.
---
Before I begin my hunt for the elusive good loots, I remove my vestiments and sacrifice my Brahmin to the RnG Gods. As I chant of their glory, and beg for their pity, I smear the blood of the sacrifice upon myself. I find afterwards I can usually find a 2 star drop within a few hours.
---
sugar grove. pencils and clipboards will give wood and lead/springs which are even more sought after.
---
It frees you up several perk cards. Fine as is
---
They do remove them and they haven‚Äôt had any come back that I am aware of
---
And and and I love the community! That‚Äôs the most important thing with online games. The community makes or breaks the experience!
---
Nice, I used to have my camp on the opposite bank to this although you did a far better job at making it look homely.
---
This looks nice, although I think it would look nicer and more permanent with concrete foundation pieces. üòâ
---
Awesome post,  üëç from me.  Added you on PSN looking for Ultracite mods.  Have mats will tip üòò also love the handle üòç
---
Yes, though I had my first major pvp battle yesterday in Adventure Mode. Two guys lvl 100 and 106 tried to take my Poseidon workshop. I, level 71, managed to smack them both down twice and made a hefty sum of caps in the process.
---
Had my heart racing. Have no idea how I came out on top. Either they were terrible at pvp or I'm a lot better than I thought.
---
I love that Adventure mode is now your chill mode and Survival is where you go to sweat. Gives two groups of players what they want out of the game.
---
Not sure about the percentage but I can confirm that you don‚Äôt take any damage. 
---
The best song in the game is "I didnt know hoooo the gun was loaded" lol
---
And that‚Äôs why I think pvp shouldn‚Äôt be totally taken out.
---
Glad to hear you were the victor!
---
Totally agree
---
If ur looking to just buy the entire suit it's about 2000+ caps on the market subs..just an FYI
---
Wiki says 10% not sure what the Damage on Reactive plate is VS.  Rebar. 
---
Thank you very much!
---
That is an interesting find godzillaflick. We will give this a shot also and see if that does make them work. When we tried to use them we found they would not be consumed, make the animation of using them(picking up item animation for those watching us) and made the sound as if we were stealthed, however, if we have to favorite them and then use them, I didn‚Äôt think any of the people with us did that. 
---
It's exciting. Reminded me of playing WoW on a PVP server a long time ago. Doesn't help my anxiety that I'm always carrying a shed load of junk on me at all times.
---
You have to work for a company to speak about them? Shit, I hope you never said anything nasty about McDonalds, Karen, otherwise, whew boy, you're _fucked_ aren't you.
---
I've played other Bethesda games and other online games. I speak from experience _playing_ these games and playing them with mods. I made an educated guess.
---
Your idea is stupid. "You don't work there so you aren't allowed to talk about it uwu" lmao
---
I'm a shotty build so it's good and never knew bait worked like that thank you!!
---
Yes it has i been liking it way more. I am loving the expanded camp limit i was never much for decos but now i am since the expansion/changes. Just sucks we are only allowed one fermentor. I am loving ant lager for my hoarding addiction. My next goal is to hoard up enough resources and build a ton of power armor parts and break them down for mods. I have a max INT character sole purpose learning recipes and crafting for people. Have not started my combat character. 
---
Is that why I like it so much?
---
I really like that spot :) close enough to the places I visit most frequently.
---
There was a low level there before u
---
Going to start a little after 7
---
nice work :D
---
Yup thats what i‚Äôm looking to buy! Not enough caps for it yet so I figure i buy some tokens for now. 
---
I mean, you are clearly one of the dumbos that fell for this. Grow up. Just because they call something a beta doesn't mean it is. 
---
Keep up the good work!
---
Make sure you are growing at least 5 razorgrain and 5 corn as the recipe requires them. 
---
* Sell excess chems.  With Pharma Farma in Luck, you'll be swimming in them.  Even more so if you run a build that focuses on flat damage reduction.  I sell Rad-X and a fair bit of RadAway and Stimpacks.
---
* Bulk and sell junk.  This isn't the most efficient strategy, but it does allow you to free up some weight in your Stash by turning it into Caps.
---
* Become a water salesman.  Set up a bunch of water purifiers at your CAMP.  You don't even need a body of water, just have 6-8 of the ground ones working all the time.  You'll amass quite a bit of Purified Water over time which you can sell for a decent profit.
---
* Civil War outfit plans.  Basically, everything else goes out the window once you get these.  You're looking for a random encounter with a Civil War Re-enactor corpse.  He can spawn southwest of the Overseer's Camp, northeast of New Gad on the road leading into Summersville, and down next to a ship with a blue stripe around it south of New Gad.  Any plan will do, but in particular, the Civil War Top Hat costs just 1 Cloth to make and sells for over 28-34 Caps.  Finally, all that Pre-War Money is good for something! üòÇ
---
Thank you for this awesome story. I wish you were in my world
---
Never thought of that.  Great idea
---
For everyone who spent a shedload on pre order editions I too hope the game improves with time, shame the good updates are still months away. Ay at least we can make beer? That‚Äôs why we play fallout, right? 
---
So basically be a prettier New Vegas that only uses Interplay and Obsidian's lore?
---
Gauss ammo is hard to come by for me...
---
You're trying to justify people being dicks because its "the wasteland"?  Its a video game,  It shouldn't be allowed at all, hence why they added a survival mode.  If you're the competitive sort, or just don't have the mental capacity to have fun without crapping on others, then that's where you go.  You trying to justify people's bad behavior because "it's fallout" is indicative of what is really the problem.  People emboldened by the fact that they can enjoy a relative degree of safety from repercussions due to the anonymity of the internet and engaging in behaviors against others that they would never have the stones to in real life.  The fact that they are in adventure mode doing it, instead of trying that on someone in survival mode where they would probably get smashed and actually suffer consequences shows the cowardice of most "griefers". Which is why they remain in adventure mode where most folks are peaceful, instead of survival mode where everyone is ready to scrap.

I stopper playing for a while, but i've always wanted pickpocketing level 3 exclusively to break into people's bases. I don't even know what i would do after that, it's just the joy of being somewhere you're not supposee to be
---
I just use pacifism mode and had 2 frustrated russian griefers try to bodyblock me, jump in front of me and shout at me who wanted to fight me. Always love to see frustrated human garbage despair when their petty little tricks dont work anymore since slap dmg and shit was removed.
---
Did they fix the Recon Sensors mod for the X-01 helmet?  I had that awhile back and it never marked anything.
---
If you are using a station spawn point then your tactical control of the map is nonexistend and you neglect the foundations upon which we all have to compete.
---
It defintly gives a chance to double when you harvest flora and it stacks with green thumb. Was getting 4 razorgrains sometimes when harvesting.
---
*23 now
---
Care bear whining. The whole point of survival was to give PVPers an outlet to kill. People will find literally any reason to bitch about this game.
---
Make a new survival character. Gift it to yourself. Go kill lvl 200+ bloodied build characters. Profit.
---
Was asked a night or so ago if I had and Fasnacht masks, I gave them all my extras. Last night someone messaged me asking for help with a scorpion at Top of the World because they didn't have any good guns. Gave him a 3* shotgun I don't use and 1000 shells.
---
When I'm excessively overencumbered I'll find a random low level and give them a bunch of aid and scrap.
---
Great reference 
---
I'd barely had any disconnected recently... until this week. Now it's several a session. Including once right after I looted a real nice 3-star weapon; logged back in and it was gone. Cool cool cool.
---
(My frequent disconnects actually started after I started working on getting the Nuka-Cola Quantum paint. That quest is cursed. DC'ed 5 times just trying to get the keys.)
---
You get the weapon at the level you are when you receive it 
---
Apparently their experience is limited to exploiting new players. 
---
By level 200 you have most perk cards and everything set, given you don‚Äôt have the right perk cards allocated to use each build. My point was that their is a counter to each build. Mine happens to be shotguns. They can cripple my limbs and stagger me and my armor is useless. In the right scenario I can counter every other build tho unless they have sent/ass as well. But that‚Äôs why I said I play with a melee main and a shotgunner. As a team we don‚Äôt have a problem, as solo we sometimes do
---
This. 
---
For me, not knowing how close an event is to ending puts me off travelling to them when i finally spot them on the map.  
---
I've fast travelled to plenty only to find I have 30 seconds left to do a bunch of tasks, leading to inevitable failure :(
---
Note that full strength Rad-X suppresses mutations for a period of time even with Starched Genes. But diluted Rad-X does not. 
---
Also you can take serums with Starched Genes equipped. 
---
10/10 for the minutemen
---
Reading these I couldn‚Äôt help but be like ‚Äúbut still why though?‚Äù and this is a good reason. I have a similar build on my main character for adventure mode scavenging. That‚Äôs still a lot of stimpaks though lol.
---
It's random.  Any vendor usually has at least one (random armor type) + (random armor mod).  The problem is there are so many potential combinations of these that finding Combat Armor Dense is not only extremely rare, but something seems weighted against it given that I see Marine or Robot Armor Dense more frequently, whereas in all this time, I've seen Combat and Metal Armor Dense *once*.
---
But in general, I think all the vendors need another pass for this, and things that have gone AWOL since Patch 5, like the BoS plans, Grahm's unique inventory, etc.
---
I have my camp on the golf course at white springs on one of the greens. It happens to be a random encounter spot too. Yesterday I had a miss nanny stop me and tell me the story of little red riding hood and how a miss nanny cut granny out of the big bad wolf's stomach with her saw and that they always keep the kids they are charged with safe.
---
#cold
---
Once had a camp with a public trash can where I placed all the stuff I couldn't use, had a sign saying "FREE PLUMBING TOOLS" :P
---
It had to be said. 
---
New Netflix anime show: Snallygaster Spit Attack Explosion
---
Great Job everyone who participated this great idea! Maybe beth-people (pun intended)  saw this operation tourniquet and decided to make this as a real quest (ergo: they had not think of this before) . We will wait and see.
---
That certainly adds to the fear of losing the fight
---
The thing that I feel made the hatred towards '76 most overwhelming in the press was the fact that it wasn't Fallout5. It is, a multiplayer version of FO4, graphically and functionally. Some people see this as a defective game, while others are just happy to be dealing damage to supermutants and Snallygasters. I'm in the second camp, I make my own fun if there's not much happening. Jumping off tall buildings and stabby, stabby, stabby. However I can see why there is some backlash towards Bethesda, they did release a fairly munted game, and unfortunately that's what the press jumped on straight away.
---
What‚Äôs you gt so I can invite you to the club 
---
Holy moly I just realized I have the ultracite armor plans and decontamination arch learned already. Must have spam learned a bunch of stuff after a SBQ battle and didn't realize.... Whelp off to mine ultracite and find calibrated shocks for this armor.
---
Tesla coil is great. I have it on a T51b set, ghouls sometimes bounce back when the arc hits them. I think they removed defensive mechanisms from triggering pvp so it would be great to try that on griefer wannabes. 
---
Just not sure why anyone would wast their time on something so starved for content when there‚Äôs so many other great games out there to sink your teeth into. 
---
Agreed.  There really should be a token Not-SBQ boss for nukes that hit anywhere other than Fissure Site Prime.
---
Legendary auto grenade launcher. 
---
After having my "nice" home attacked a few times, I watch it like a hawk and even crouch when I'm in it.  Yesterday I saw a level 140 something and a 40 something converging near my home.  I immediately changed my perk cards around for battle, went outside, crouched (I have a chameleon piece) and prepared to kill some griefers.  Much to my surprise they just hopped right by.  WTH?!?!  Why couldn't I have been this ready back when the jerk offs were still around?  LOL  I was slightly disappointed.  Only slightly...
---
You're right, the adventure mode has more fun to offer. In survival, you're toast if you're under level 100 with t-60 power armor.
---
I suppose the only way to sell is to go to adventure then?
---
Yeah make a post on the two markers subs also:
---
r/Market76
---
r/fo76bazaar 
---
The irony is that you're the one who sounds like a little baby bitch in saying this.
---
Then go play those games instead of posting here loser
---
I would fully support these changes.  Looking forward to eventually getting a pet, but I am concerned about the bugginess from all that I have read about it. 
---
I bought the RP‚Äôs schematic from the vendor bot in Camden park following a fellow poster‚Äôs advice. Compared to other mods for Excavator, reactive plate is not very common. I visit multiple vendors on a daily basis, have only seen it once. 
---
Passive perks would free up some points...so that kinda negates your last point there. 
---
I keep 2 2shot fatmans on me mainly for when people wanna PvP
---
Sometimes people go AFK and then they vanish. I always worry and think maybe their house caught on fire.
---
Yeah I thought they were lights as well, but I think they're actually reflectors.  
---
haha, I didn't think anyone would notice that.
---
They‚Äôre for a bomb removal quest from a robot in the mire @ the southern belle motel
---
like a bad divorce 
---
The Bone Wanderer
---
"Swapped out Perk Points?"  What do you mean there? .... Also seem to not run into nice folks.   But instead in jerks wanting to go PVP.   Though the new patch may help remove that.
---
It seems to be a pretty rare event. The whole server gets seeds from it (don't tell Bethesda), but I think you need to actually do the event to learn the juice recipe.
---
I found out you can place your camp on the other side of the road from the Overseer camp. I tore down my old hotel down the road and built a bar directly across from the Overseer camp. Anybody going to the Overseer camp will see my bar first and maybe stop by and get a drink!
---
Thanks, Yeah.   Just a case of I seem to spend all my time doing fiber/screw runs ... to fix my armor.   Then again to upgrade my weapons.  Then my armor is broken so I have to do it again for that.   Then I've leveled up and need to make new armor.   Then it breaks.  etc. :) 
---
Wow I made this comment 4 months  ago lol.
---
I have a QE Combat and Double Barrel and I love them for daily use and cheesing. The fire rate on QEDB is hilarious. I have 5 explosive shotguns, but I might get a QE pump just for the trifecta lol
---
They really just need to take player icons completely off the map if they're not in your party.
---
Do you have lvl 3 Class Freak? 
---
This is baller. 
---
1. Get the clown facepaint and jack up your face as much as possible. Deformed ears, pug nose with scares and sun burn, skin sploches everywhere, and balding hair woth a what ever bright color you prefer.
---
2. Get your clown outfit on that youve been using for the 100th time to kill a wendigo
---
3. Marsupial, speed demon, chameleon.
---
4. Cannibal.
---
5. Honestly whatever weapon you fill says "fear but fun". I personally like the bat with chains for up close when spotted and the daisycutter and orbital strikes for long distance "whos fucking with me".
---
6. Optional: Mic and something that can make a honking noise
---
I only use the missile launcher for shooting down cargo bots but... past that it sort of sits on my alt collecting dust
---
Both I and a friend had the same issue yesterday.  I think something was boinked from the last update 
---
Will have to post a pic of my build later.  But basically I'm fairly equal on SPEI ... using rifles-sniper-style and switching to melee when it gets rough.   Originally was trying to be all sniper style like I've played most fallouts.    But got to where my weapons started barely hurting lots of creatures.  So I had to switch to melee because it seemed the only way to take some of these things down.
---
Yes it was a great change when they removed slap damage, there‚Äôs much fewer griefers now than before the patch. I have only turned on pacifist mode lately, in the past I always reserve the right to fight back and it usually accomplished in one or two shots. Now since slap dmg is gone, there‚Äôs no need to keep that option open. We get to ignore the human garbage completely and focus on our own fun. 
---
I‚Äôm playing Breath of the Wild as we speak
---
I have over 76 hours in the game (thanks achievement) and I don't think I've ever been in a radstorm.
---
Maybe with seasons they will change events and find a way to make them more popular!
---
Good, one less TSE in survival mode *thumbs up*
---
We appreciate your support Customer 65221185 and the next available agent will assist you as soon as the bombs have stopped dropping. 
---
sometimes if you encounter that, you exit build mode, go back into it and try again and it should allow you to delete it
---
&gt; p it, know that Cryolators are good for one major thing: freezing the Scorchbeast Queen. I don't know if Two-Shot implies you'll freeze her faster, but if 2-3 players come to an average SBQ battle with enough Cryo Cells, you'll have a significantly higher chance of beating her because you can keep her pinned to the ground, where most of the damage is done. It's good to have the Crystallizing Barrel on it for both range and efficiency - it lobs ice projectiles when you do, instead of the weird flamethrower-is
---
Okay well can I trade it for something else like a  TSE gauss rilfe? But I'll hold unto it until then.
---
That makes sense. This has never happened to me before but I guess if I'm not the only one it must be something on their end, as usual.
---
I did actually have it, so I‚Äôve now made myself a new mis-matched torso ;).   I‚Äôll let you know how it goes.  
---
If anyone‚Äôs wondering I do not see any changes in  the model at all adding this mod, no rebar sticking out ;) 
---
Props to a fellow dweller wearing the BoS Scribe uniform!
---
Good day to you fine sir.
---
Todd stole my cat and forced me to buy Skyrim VR. [https://i.imgur.com/wolB7XA.png](https://i.imgur.com/wolB7XA.png)
---
LOL. A bunch of modern-day church ladies and temperance goons in here.  Now you're arguing for wholesome messages... in Fallout.
---
I hope its been reported up so they can fix it!
---
A trader is looking for offers, not offer. Give your best one, and if you get beat move on. Maybe you should post and see if someone will sell you what you're looking for at a price you can afford. That'd make more sense because you're the one constrained by caps. 
---
if you're gonna buy it on PC I recommend waiting for the steam release. 
---
It can be useful to have separate rank 1, 2 and 3 of certain perks. It then gives you the options to *reduce* a card rather than remove it.
---
Good thing I haven't and will never play survival mode...
---
I completely quit this game due to crashing and game freezes. No exaggeration, I even began to count, trying to go up the top of the world elevator my game crashed 30 out of 30 times. Haven‚Äôt even considered playing since. 
---
Everything is replaced by Tim Allen. Aaaaaaarrroooogh 
---
It‚Äôs not supposed to be easy....
---
I meant if you made the post looking for an item... and someone comments  ‚Äúyeah mate give me 2k caps and it‚Äôs yours‚Äù but some other dude comes in and replies to that guys saying he‚Äôll give him 4k caps for that item‚Äù thus stealing your trade or costing you twice as much now
---
But the missiles are balanced so they are of equal value as a machete, boxing gloves or pipe pistol. WTF is wrong with you that you don't enjoy fun?
---
Yeah i only found it a couple days ago on a body
---
I had changed it all for you but cant share for some reason... I'll send you the picture in private! That's what I would do as a pure crafter! Only point I might be tempted to change on that picture would be the amount of charisma if you plan on vendoring a lot...
---
Yo imma head over there
---
Yup, you are right on the 'taking what you need to stay alive and carry more' :) -- Started on rifle build, got to where I was doing better.  Then more recently things got tougher and tougher.  Started not doing as well on the guns point, and started finding better melee weapons, so started carrying those around as well, and started putting more stuff into melee, crafting, etc.  To try to keep alive.   And then focused (where I am now) on finding better armor plans.  Because I seem to find crap, and need to make everything!
---
RE: to your suggestions:
---
1. I think I have 1 White Knight, keep finding something 'better' than getting the 2nd one.  I should get it now I guess.
---
2. Armorer I'm at 4 I think.   Never bothered with Fix It Good, seemed silly.   But now I'm kicking myself, guess it makes a lot more sense now.    Especially if it doesn't cost extra to do the fix, but you get more benefit.
---
3. Gunsmith: again, I think I'm at 4 right now.  Do need to max it.
---
4. Weapon Artisan - Again, totally ignored it.   Guess I need to pick it up
---
5. Power Patcher:  I've been specifically not doing PA builds.  Took the various "+armor if not wearing power armor" perks.
---
Thanks ... will look into these options!
---
Did this with Artillery grenade... followed by artillery shells. Send them the clip with just the question "Boom?"
---
Well I can guarantee it‚Äôs a lot more stable now. It was a rough launch and first couple of months but it‚Äôs extremely more stable than it use to be. I rarely crash anymore. I did a little bit before the last half patch right when they launched wild Appalachia but they fixed it a week later. Online games are always going to have bugs on patches though but I think Bethesda has done a great job at addressing them as quickly as possible.
---
I know my first stop when I log on. Shhhhh 
---
I'm pretty sure as long as you fast travel to the event when it's on your map you still get the reward once you get there, even if it ends. Happened to me a few times with Fasnacht
---
I like the workshops. What I hate about them is people who claim them, and then do nothing with them.
---
I'll have to check it out.
---
That is legendaryüòÇüòÇ
---
Everybody gets a Skyrim holotape but when you try to play it, it says your Pip-Boy doesn't meet the system requirements.
---
I have one Lucky Break IIRC ... but not Draw.   Will look into getting these as well.   Feels 'weird' focusing so many perk picks on 'keep stuff alive', versus ones to be more deadly.   But yeah, guess that's where I need to be for a while.
---
I got briefed once. I was checking out a guys camp and him and his 3 teammates all level 150 or above just taped my ass and stole my little bit of junk. I told my level 180 friend with pretty much indestructable armor jump to me, killed them and wiped their camp before I could respawn. I never laughed so hard at punks before in my life. Only time though on Xbox. Just lucky I guess. I just hit level 86 today. I'm enjoying the survival mode much better now. 
---
No jus junk and some aid.. sometimes alot sometimes a lil
---
Quick question does the reduction work in pa . Stacking is gonna be great as my shotgun and previous handmade where twice as heavy as my Gauss rifle and won't be stuck in excavator cripple
---
üéâ Thanks üéâ
---
Wrong. You have to work for a company before you open your mouth about "breaking servers". Shut your mouth.
---
I sell the skeleton outfit,  but I hear the civil war tophat is good to sell as well.  Someone will chime in hopefully. 
---
Christ you're an idiot
---
&gt; If you are using a station spawn point
---
Which I never once said that I did. Everything you are saying is based on assumptions about how I play that are dead wrong.
---
wait i'm pretty sure i've been there (idk tho) you were afk by the door and i just played the piano for like 2 mins (if that was you then thanks for the decontamination shower if not  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø  )
---
Genius. 
---
I walked out of the Vault and was instantly hit with a Radstorm. I seem to get them a lot in my 100 hours.
---
I‚Äôve heard tophat is 1 cloth and sells for 50 or 60 caps. Trying to find the plan myself. 
---
What's your psn? It wont let me send it from here for some reason... mine is Ishtardeela
---
Lost my Hunter's Long Coat due to this while trading with my friend. 
---
First day playing it I got blasted by some db who apparently wanted my workshop I'd just taken.  I waved and was about to send a team invite......
---
I found both the cat and the Dog along the road heading south from Abbys Bunker- there is a Tree that most times has a Wendingo (maybe 2 or 3) spawn there , just past that tree is a burnt out car - this spot has a random event &amp; is the one that spawned him for me- if its not the creature or random event you want run back up to Abbys Bunker- theres another random spawn as you approach the bunker - and server hop here . 
---
Animal Friend 3 required.
---
Good Luck :) 
---
You have to work for a company before you open your mouth about "ruining recipes". Shut your mouth.
---
I think it‚Äôs once you hit level 50. Instead of picking a new perk card you can opt to move perk a point each new level. So if you have 12 in Strength and 4 in Intelligence, you can move one point from strength to intelligence making them 11 and 5. I found bumping up intelligence helped me a lot. 
---
I‚Äôve only been had problems with people wanting pvp a couple of times. For me I‚Äôve found being friendly helps others be friendly back, I wave at literally everyone I encounter. I think pvp will be mostly on survival now, the last few days have been really calm in adventure mode. 
---
The 15% resistance per piece works for all attacks and enemies. Assassins is just other players. The 15% isnt included in the base DR per piece so its on top of that and if you have 5 pieces thats a big DR bonus. 
---
Xbox here have had small griefs nothing major but some dudes I played with demolishing bases
---
Aw crap. I should have mentioned I‚Äôm on Xbox. 
---
I can Guarantee that won‚Äôt be the case after wastelanders. To me the most important thing is they got the foundation right and that it in fact feels like fallout. Now they just have to keep adding more stuff to do which they are committed to doing. So the future is bright with this one.  I Love the map in fact I think it‚Äôs the best map in any Bethesda game so far. That‚Äôs huge for me. I know it will be considered one of the best if not the best fallout game when all is said and done. It‚Äôs an investment and I have two level 100 characters so far so I think it was worth it. 
---
Nah. I didn‚Äôt really like the survival aspects (hunger and thirst bar) in the first place, but it‚Äôs bearable, but survival games aren‚Äôt my style. Btw, how did you get the Enclave flair next to ur name?
---
civil war top hat : 1 cloth = 38 caps (high charisma of course)
---
skeleton outfit / marine tactical helmet also good if you have unused plastic / glass
---
Again you only have insults and confusing logic to fall back on. Nifty.
---
I like this Idea, except for the fast travel...its a money hub and exclusive, it should cost something to get there.  
---
I'd like it if when you create a player vendor at your camp... you could also make items visible  in the hub at whitespring. more like an auction board and people can bid so we can maximize the profits.  
---
But I think players are unanimous that they want a social hub in game somewhere.. Whitespring is the absolute best choice location wise
---
Tbh, I‚Äôm not really sure why I stopped playing. I was just bored. Maybe I‚Äôll just play with friends and not alone.
---
Agreed, low levels run for the hills usually and I feel awkward stalking them, trying to get their attention:)
---
I griefed a level 5 on Adventure yesterday. He got tired of my sniper fire, ran over and struck me, and then he promptly experienced death via a ski sword. That dude was carrying so much wonderful junk, I couldn't believe my luck and I shudder to think of how overburdened he must have been. I gladly removed his burden, and saw the benefits of a good session of grief farming.
---
I was busy collecting resources at the dirt track when somebody 18 levels higher than me came along and took it over. That wasn't too fun.
---
Not to escape like that, but yesterday I spent about 2 hours in a nuke zone trying to get the flux, fluid, and masses I needed for the calibrated shocks on my power armor. Then I realized there was no way my grossly over encumbered ass was going to get back to a chem bench before the flux was useless. Drank one of my nukashine hoping I'd end up somewhere better, but it only moved me from the middle of the cranberry bog to the middle of the mire.  So now my camp is in the middle of the mire.
---
That's fine. Same GT as Reddit name. Message me on Xbox with the shotgun 
---
They add an event with a human npc that gets killed Everytime, no matter what you do.
---
Can ya post those pics? My curiousity has been peeked.
---
Again you're too ignorant to understand basic concepts
---
There is a LFG option if you're on Xbox...
---
These are the moments that make the game great. I‚Äôve met a lot of good hearted people and it‚Äôs been a blast playing with them. 
---
The wooden desk is in the Pleasant Valley Ski Resort, on the counter in the room with the vendor bot.
---
Stash is a choice mechanic. You can't keep 2 broadsiders,4 minigun,2 fatmans,4 rifles because maybe you'll use it later or whenever.
---
Only keep what you need,sell or trade the rest.  
---
As others said try to keep food and chems,ammo on you. You have weight perks,stash doesn't.
---
I keep between 50 and 100 of almost any material but spring,screws,ballistic fiber,lead. This is my choice because i like to have things ready when needed. But having low junk let's you play more without getting boring.
---
Think I know where you are...
---
Double is best for stopping power and RoF but lacks mag size. Low key wish they would put a custom paint in that makes it look like the super shotgun from doom
---
Okay Ricky
---
You'd be surprised to see the complete lack of assholes in this game. One guy complimented my camp once, I joined his team, and 30 minutes later we went on a killing spree of Scorchbeasts (very high-level enemies) before we exchanged our loot. I've played for about 100 hours and haven't encountered a single griefer. This game's community is awesome.
---
That's fucked
---
I've got a couple of guys that play.  Shoot me a message and I can work stuff out.  I work till 10 pm est tonight
---
Oh yeah playing with friends makes it infinitely better. This game has a great player base and that‚Äôs probably the only reason it‚Äôs a great fallout game in my opinion. 
---
The targeting HUD causes game crashes due to a bug, not worth using until they fix that.
---
I'm to much of a young one to get this reference.
---
God I love Radicool.
---
Trust me buddy. You‚Äôre the one that is lost here. I 100% understand what you‚Äôre saying. If you think I don‚Äôt you‚Äôre the one misinterpreting things. 
---
We have both summarized what you have said and it came out the same way every time. You are straight up wrong to say that anyone who partakes in drugs or alcohol in game is an incel or an immature child. And the way you say it is a personal attack against anyone that does. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. What part of this conversation are you missing?
---
Yea they already said theyll be adding a timer to events
---
Wait...what? Why do you loose caps when you die?
---
well since i have none of those crazy one-shot high dmg weapons but the strongest thing i have is a 1 star plasma gatling with the legendary effect that increases dmg for consecutive hit, I cant afford to reserve the option to fight back.
---
Even more, since I like big-fight-events like the Scorched-Beast-Queen Fight I prefer the mode to avoid any potential damage done to other players that could then start attacking me. Its simply safer that way.
---
In any case, yes since the patch it has become calmer, although the assheads who exploit the workshop contest mechanic are still around and the only reason why i still avoid workshops completely despite my love for building things.
---
Oh I meant the survival mode where you get to PVP with no restrictions. And the enclave flair is just user flair. On mobile if I hold down one of my comments, user flair pops up and you decide what one to use
---
Praying 4 u

Being an every day SB user, I can confirm, it just work fine from the favorites
---
I haven't set up a decontamination shower yet so that was someone else.  I have a jam space with a piano, bass, and drums though.  I've only had all 3 in use at the same time once so far.
---
thank Christ 
---
Its basic knowledge that crippling a limb will limit the mobility of a creature. Bethesda understands this with legs, but not wings for some reason. If I nail a SB's wings with over 500 shots from a gatling plasma, it shouldn't still be flying like nothing happened.
---
Leader of the pack gives you 3. Uranium fever also gives you 3 but it‚Äôs risky because other people commonly show up. 
---
Oh well 
---
&gt; like the BoS plans
---
Oh.. You can't buy these anymore? I spent quite some time hopping Grafton station the last few days with no luck. You can't learn these by scrapping either? 
---
Hook me up with a discord invite. Xbox player as well looking for some fellow wastelanders to rebuild america with
---
Honestly rarely ran into pvp people before, even less the ones that min max their build to kill with slap damage. 
---
But now, it's so much easier to give benefit of the doubt and give meds and food and gear to lower levels, or have tag alongs during harder events and such. It's just more social, as social as the small server size can be at least. 
---
Have you guys seen Helvetia? It's literally an exact replica of the town.
---
With you 100% if they could just put a timer on the events to show what state it's in, warmup, or active. That way you know whether it's not yet started or nearly finished. I really hate showing up to Uranium Fever when there's only a couple of minutes left on it.
---
&gt; I encountered another player who was nice enough to bestow upon me a .50 caliber machine gun with two shot exploded effect
---
Where in all that is porn's name do you people find these guys ? Damn it I want one as well.
---
hmm. im gonna go ahead and never speak of this again :P
---
Add GranbyKillDozer 
---
 But it‚Äôs not actually hard, just RNG based. I could spend 15 hours and only get 1 legendary, then spend 1 more hour and get the other 24. It‚Äôs not a difficult challenge because killing legendaries is not hard, but finding them is preventing people from completing it. 
---
I second this one. Appalachia must accept Communism as an alternative to the capitalist society that caused the world to unravel as it did. Propaganda flyers are free, obviously.
---
exactly. let's hope they do it VERY soon 
---
Thank Todd!
---
Hahaha 
---
Is it just PVP? Nothing else?
---
I met a really nice gent today who sold me the skeleton mask for my outfit and some mini nukes. 
---
Best bet is leader of the pack and uranium fever events. Also, some servers spawn more legendaries than others. Try finding one of those servers. 
---
It has everything normally in the game. The only differences are the no pvp restrictions, maybe leader board and maybe I missed something because I didnt spend much time on it yet but its essentially just free PVP
---
Fast travel to an event should not be more expensive than rewards from event.
---
Ammo rewards should only include the ammo you use during event (Mini-nukes and rockets are heavy and just get dumped by most).
---
No matter which part of the map, events should level scale. A larger portion of the server are level 50+ generally. Its rare for events to have worthwhile rewards for higher levels.
---
Give events a unique loot pool (possibly plans or outfits), or more that give the character short duration buff (+1 to a special?).
---
Event timers start when players start events. Few things in this game are as frustrating as fast traveling to an event that has 30 seconds left, and you get the fail notification once you finish loading.
---
Yeah, no thanks. 
---
wait what? how did you get that from all that I've said, Fallout 3 also had great lore, just fallout 4 and 76 went kind of dried out
---
They increase it as able due to server stability.
---
5 is a no go.. I'd even suggest drop more stuff. Like some ammo and a maybe the last weapon used
---
immersion
---
I‚Äôm glad they didn‚Äôt ruin your camp.
---
I do something similar because I don‚Äôt want my decon shower destroyed and have to repair it.
---
Well they just had a big fasnacht event that failed to give out 4-5 rewards. So yeah, assuming the events dont glitch we now have to accept that we have a less than 1% chance of getting something good. nobody wants to spend 5-10 minutes for 5 purified waters, 36 rounds of 10mm and some junk at the expense of using better ammo and item condition. 
---
Theres no incentive to doing a single event outside of horde events since legendary enemies are fkn impossible to find and legendary drops are still broken.
---
Yes I don‚Äôt know if anyone has realized this or maybe just my luck but every time since survival started I have been getting at least 1 three star legendary at white springs.  I don‚Äôt PVP so not sure if that‚Äôs the reason or what.
---
Common to see on Prime because people will sometimes nuke the Queen back to back. 
---
Always make them come to you. 
---
Haha. +1 üëç
---
I head there and opt for the road route: North camp, South camp and train station/Pleasant valley in the middle. It's a great circuit. Sometimes legendary animals spawn on the roads and also attack the camps so you can get lucky there too. 
---
If only the vendors were separated, it would be so good. 
---
Well done on some great drops!
---
Have you tried making a call to customer service. I had a return that had not received a refund and after a few months I called them. It was sorted out in a few hours.
---
I'm ready whenever anyone wants to join up. 
---
There seems to be a bug with excavator armor legs (it may be others also, but I've only used Excavator armor so far) where on login it shows I have 460 carry weight, but if I exit and re-enter my PA it goes down to 360. I haven't seen calibrated shocks anywhere in game but I feel like when I crafted the legs they showed up as an option - I may have found a recipe somewhere prior to crafting them though but I honestly can't remember, so either I have calibrated shocks and they're bugging out, or I don't but the game thinks I do every time I log in /shrug.
---
I use that route all the time too it‚Äôs one of my favorite clears in the game
---
I love how getting blackout drunk and waking up in a random place actually makes sense in any situation. Surrounded by hostile players, high level monsters, over encumbered, lost, etc. Now that‚Äôs immersion :P
---
Try west of lady janet's soft serve on the road. It seems to be a random spawn with more responder's stuff and less other stuff. I have better luck there with the vendor bot. May have to hop a few times to locate the spawn point.
---
only when im scavving in a mole miner spot to save ammo, since they drop them + launchers so much 
---
Just stop the quest until you get to 50 and you'll get the lvl 50 weapon.
---
That‚Äôs a bit to harsh :)))
---
I have just done 3 Horde event and not 1 legendary?? I thought there was always supposed to be one on a Horde event but not tonight!! 
---
To be honest, Anthem made me realise that maybe Fallout 76, whilst still not acceptable, is perhaps not so bad. At the very least it's worth keeping an eye on.
---
They can also be on same piece as assassin's and stack. That's potentially a 23% damage reduction in PVP per piece of armor (up to the 95% cap). On their own, they're quite a damage reduction on their own though, and can be combined with lone wanderer and dodgy perks and others to make you quite hardy. 
---
I‚Äôm tired of the piss poor RNG of rewards from them, its all thats left for me to do now, just bounce around doing events. But I‚Äôve never even once gotten a reasonable reward, no outfits, no cavalier or sentinel anything armor. I pretty much dont bother anymore.
---
*epic music come on*
---
song gonna be good
---
"Praise the lord and pass the ammunition."
---
I want Groucho Glasses available as a one day item in the atomic shop.
---
I would like to test my build vs yours, I‚Äôm on PC ign AlexKGB
---
Oh yeah, that is crap. 
---
I started it in my 20's, finished it at 120 or so, got a level 50 all rise.
---
Also alow fast travel to you for 5 minutes without requiring being friended. 
---
On my way! 
---
If a player kills you. You lose your level times 2 in caps
---
Im just praying that the rest of the updates for this season bring me some fun back. Im getting a bit bored now of farming and getting shit. Done 2 days of farming and haven't actually had any weapons drop, just shit armour. 
---
The music is great!! I always thought it‚Äôd be cool if they added holotapes that you could find with different songs and stuff and you could find like a radio tower and put in the holotape and active the tower and it would broadcast the songs! 
---
There's a [party table](https://i.imgur.com/KOxSG8v.png) at the top of the ridge located [here.](https://i.imgur.com/M1JnnAW.png) The Death Blossoms event takes place in the woods behind it.
---
Bummer.  Some people don‚Äôt team.....  or care about pleasantries.  
---
Those are some of the risks with workshops.  I normally just let them have it if I‚Äôm not there.
---
My two cents:   
---
Medic Pump doesn't work in PvP (it's just not fast enough).Core Assembly is almost always better choice than Kinetic Dynamo. 
---
In a nutshell: Any starred legendary that you take down yourself. Unstarred legendaries do NOT count. Legendaries you tag but do not put the final bullet in yourself do NOT count.
---
If you're only down six (or heck even if you're down 20) your best bet is to hit up events with reliable legendary spawns. That means Horde events, Leader of the pack and Uranium Fever. Sometimes the Enclave events will trigger legendaries as well. (BotStop, Dropped Connection, It's a Blast, etc.) And of course you can try your luck at the normal haunts but that can be time consuming (not to mention risky if you're trying to avoid getting shot) so I only do that while I'm waiting for events to start.
---
Proof that it's possible: https://i.imgur.com/74TKRpp.jpg
---
I guessed as much. I‚Äôll just keep wandering around in the area until I get lucky and it starts up. I‚Äôm glad at least my research was confirmed and I know I‚Äôm on the right track. Thanks for the help everyone.
---
I agree from a merching standpoint but everyone's susceptible to this lure. 
---
i use them, but i will not craft or buy them. though i am in the market for a better missile launcher
---
Or they died from constipation.
---
We miss you, Elvis.
---
Totally agree!  I‚Äôm willing to trust a touch further
---
I think it is always max level
---
Good Luck , once captured a Deathclaw will go red on its health bar but is still passive only to you. 
---
To fix this and permanently pacify it you need to pacify it once it arrives at your camp and immediately quit to the main menu and then log back in .. Your Deathclaw will now be friendly to everyone :)
---
Okay thank you so far reddit has been more helpful than anything 
---
Fallout 76 is going to blow up eventually. I honestly think that the wastelanders DLC will be the thing to make it blow up. Bethesda has hinted at in the title and description that this DLC will bring human NPC with dialogue choices and consequences just like a single player fallout game. To me that‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs missing at this point. Personally I could live without it as long as they keep adding new quest lines and things to do but I think that is the single biggest thing that turns other fallout fans off about 76. If they are able to deliver there then there‚Äôs no reason to do think that fallout 76 couldn‚Äôt be as successful as fallout 4 which by the numbers is the most successful Bethesda game ever and one of the most successful ever created. 
---
Pretty much, my entire loadout comes from Reddit. I have one gun I found in game that I use, all my armor, outfits and other gear is bought on reddit. Lame
---
Yeah, same here. Spent most of my weekend trying to get their attention, but nada, just a wealth of supermutants and wild dogs. What were you looking for?
---
Hail*
---
Open the pause menu. It's one of the options there :)
---
Just kidding guys, here's the real Fallout76!
---
As server stability imoroves, they will allow more storage. We are getting backpacks soon, and we already had 2 stash boosts.
---
Plastic, for the love of GOD plastic.
---
And glue.
---
I'm always out of glue it seems since my shit is constantly falling apart.
---
My camp is in the same spot! Nice build, way better than mine.
---
And plastic and glue.
---
My God.... This explains the vertbirds above my camp all the damn time.  ü§î
---
Maybe less people are pulling them from that server because they are on survival, so you got the drop that they used to be farming?
---
Not sure but it‚Äôs a thought.
---
Someone had their base high up on stilts with everything locked up, but I could reach a window by jumping up (marsupial), where their tinker's station became available.  I spammed the scrap button, which then placed me inside their camp.  I scrapped junk and repaired my gear, had a nice nap, did some nice cooking, and left some flowers on their bed.
---
I did not become wanted.  It was a good day.
---
People will understand the joke just once in every lifetime.
---
Depends. How much pubic hair do you have?
---
This. I just want to rep the old school BOS with T-51 
---
I'm saddened that they were so lazy (among the litany of other lazy things in this game) that they just said "fuck it" and up scaled a Mini Nuke ammo round.
---
I had someone drop a propaganda flyer at the top of the stairs to the first floor. Thought it was so great. 
---
Or you're so old you've forgotten.
---
I thought a good idea would be that flares stick to things and stay ignited if they hit something. 
---
That way you could shoot at other players and it would blur their vision for a few seconds. 
---
I agree with the OP I think the graphics are fine on PS4 and I actually enjoy the story and learning about the factions and what happened throughout West Virginia. You definitely need to have some patience with the game since it is told through holotapes and reading but I think it is a neat way to tell a story. The OP is also correct in this is going to be a ever changing g story. I‚Äôm excited to see what comes with it. 
---
However I disagree when you say ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt hate the game for the sake of it‚Äù. I think people personally dislike this game because like the OP said it is not Fallout 5. I myself was hesitant at first and I haven‚Äôt been happy with everything Bethesda has done but I actually have a lot of fun playing the game it really grew on me. 
---
I got some sweet photos, so if you do get a pet make sure you get a pic for the Album while you have the pet :).
---
And the fact that fallout 76 still has a lot of people who bought the game already is a good thing. I mean I think I have like 18 people on my friends list who own the game. Not all of them play it like I do but if they keep releasing these free DLCs then why wouldn‚Äôt they pick it back up and also why wouldn‚Äôt people that don‚Äôt own it start to buy it. I mean the game is absolutely a bargain now. You can get it on eBay for $20 and as many hours as I put in it myself I can‚Äôt think of a single better game that you can get for $20 at this point. 
---
Except I said ‚Äúalmost every asset.‚Äù  Key word being ‚Äúalmost.‚Äù  At least twice.
---
Actually as a matter of fact the advertising for the game has said that upon exiting the Vault, we shall rebuild America.  Especially in the Ron Perlman voice over trailer.  And us Vault Dwellers are America‚Äôs best and brightest hence our admittance into Vault 76.
---
And it is going to be hilarious when NPCS are added.  That is the Number 1 gripe about the game.
---
To me, it just sounds like you are projecting and come off as ‚ÄútHe GaMe Is PeRfEcT‚Äù type of person.
---
I haven‚Äôt played anthem. It looks intriguing but from reading about it it sounds like just another loot shooter like destiny which I get tired of fairly quickly. Destiny‚Äôs world in both the games is so tiny in comparison to the map in fallout 76. Yea the combat is better in destiny but i personally have always been about huge open worlds and personalization such as character builds over hardcore shooting combat. The combat isn‚Äôt awful in fallout either I don‚Äôt think.  
---
Imagine the size of a computer you would need to run a "indistinguishable" virtual world without the transistor and running on just TAPES and Vacuum Tubes....
---
I've played my first 100 or so levels in PA, and about the other half of the game without. Haven't noticed any significant difference in legendary armor drop rate. Also, my lowest level legendary on me is a TSE dragon (35) and I can not reproduce your experience at all. Haven't gotten specifically a dragon since level 151 when I got it, and I get far more each of armor and melee weapons than rifles. I appreciate the intent and work, but it seems like this wasn't done thoroughly enough to yield any significant results
---
 I also count up to a random number before I start, so far 14 has been the luckiest.
---
 3 has been the worst and so I believe it is the number of the beast. 
---
 His name is Lootifer. 
---
I thought about the division 2 but in all honesty the setting isn‚Äôt that intriguing to me. The combat looks cool but I‚Äôm not sure if I wouldn‚Äôt get bored of it fairly quickly once I had completed the main quest. Also destiny 2 has made me wary of all games like this that are hyped up with great reviews because that game has consistently left me disappointed and bored. Stupid me bought almost all the expansion packs as well until fallout 76 came out. 
---
Could be fun.  Maybe team up on some events too.  PC username = Revski
---
Yeah that would work. If I saw an icon appear on my map I‚Äôd instantly open it up and check to see whereabouts it was. The flare gun is under-utilised I feel, kinda missed opportunity so I fully support this idea! As my poster at my camp says: ‚ÄúWe are all in this together, we must WIN!‚Äù
---
That is kinda of interesting 
---
Oh. Were you the guy who dropped 197 dog food?
---
I was level 30 at the time.
---
I could give you my Firebreathers helmet, as long as I'm still allowed in without it...
---
I really like building on water, but it's so hard with this system to build a house that doesnt float in the air. I end up using the stair columns as pylons
---
I looked at my stash. Mine is a level 50 vampire sledgehammer with a mod to add a rocket and heat. 40% SS and +1 Agility
---
I like this game and have gotten well over $60 worth of enjoyment out of it.
---
Hell I‚Äôve gotten $60 of entertainment just trading and interacting with people over on the market.
---
Just realised, number of the beast 3. 3 star legendaries.. Coincidence?
---
 Take that atheists. 
---
That‚Äôs impressive, no I only lost 37 but that‚Äôs super lucky for you!  
---
cool story bro
---
Trust me you‚Äôre in the minority even but tons of people will agree with you because people who are disappointed like me don‚Äôt go on this subreddit. Hell I don‚Äôt this is my first post for it besides day one of release.
---
Seriously I dont know why they havent added this to the Atom Shop - I mean a lot of people would spend atoms on a pet in their homes - something to come back to after a day of surviving the world.
---
im gonna bing google
---
And bubblegum!  
---
The permanent bans some got for duplicating thousands, if not millions of items.
---
Except it's literally not. It's a Mark 28 Nuke, the same that were in Sentinel Site in Fallout 4:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mark\_28](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_28)
---
Key difference being the tail fins, which on the mark 28 are square, but on the mini nuke are round: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mini\_nuke\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mini_nuke_(Fallout_76)) 
---
Been playing daily since game release - Had my first PvP confrontation and 2 pricks smashed up my CAMP on the same server, all on 2nd day of Survival starting - so either it‚Äôs a full moon or the new mode is bringing out the nutters!
---
Weird flex but ok. 
---
Yeah. Sometimes Watoga spits out lvl 14 robots. Have gotten a few low lvl legendaries. Some I try to sell to twinks. Most I vendor or give away. I once chaced a lvl 2 in circles around vault 76 trying to gift them a lvl 1 furious hunting rifle. All the while spamming come hither and heart emojis.
---
I agree with you on some points. They need to get out of their comfort zone of using such a old and flawed game engine. Hell I would be ok if things get pushed back for releases if it meant a new engine being created.
---
Vault-Tec probably wouldn‚Äôt include info about the other vaults being horrifying experiments in their own simulation though, right? 
---
There are already several subs here to this topic. We just need to push one to the TOP site so Beth actually sees this.
---
Yeah, i felt the same around your level. The perks others have talked anout would have helped. But i made the error of using level on each of the small guns perks it seems.
---
I remember my game freezing a lot when walking around inside.
---
Someone destroyed a few of my crops yesterday. In retrospect, my response may have been a little heavy handed. 
---
I saw them at their base way down south and went to investigate. After wreaking glorious havoc to their base, (nice bear rug btw), I had a teammate kill me for the bounty. 
---
Soon after I saw the crop killing offender back at his base, I fast travelled nearby but he had left once I arrived. He had quickly repaired the destruction I had caused so I destroyed it all again. 
---
Was this an aggressive response? Don‚Äôt mess with a person‚Äôs Razorgrain. 
---
I completely agree with you. The creation engine is terrible hell if they want to use it so much they should just rebuild it from the ground up imo
---
You do get hunted down but not as often as you would think. 
---
Im on ps4 and i love making camps too so i might just need to check this out. Its rare to see a actual nice looking camp with time put into it in this game
---
After reading your heated post (Can't believe i have done this - meme) do you want a piece of chocolate or some tea? Does it feel better know? No Anger, No Stress. Finally got it out and made your outcome. Im so proud of you Sir.
---
Are you supposed to make me angry or something? Trust me you aren‚Äôt being witty or clever just a douche bag lmaoüòÇ
---
Same here. Everything i have thats decent in 5 months of playing this game is from reddit or another player sold it to a vendor in game. I havent got an amazing weapon or armor drop once in 5 months. Thats not even an exaggeration. I cant even get good plans to drop or spawn.
---
I do like  but I can't find anything but corn and tatos
---
It's also in one of the TNT Domes. I think Done 3. 
---
I did it what happens next?
---
https://youtu.be/4RJW9FJsSgU
---
google it. there are a few good youtube walkthroughs
---
I litterallu just hunt in adventure because of people like you lol
---
Perfect!
---
Bethesda has fixed all currently known methods of duping. They had the idea to add "seasons" to survival mode not adventure if I'm not mistaking.
---
THANK YOU!
---
Yeah and no.   Saw a newbie on Xbox (based on achievements) and went to give them some gear only have them run away.  After checking around I found some dude camped near the entrance following them in only their underwear and a stealth setup.   Sigh.    Newbie kept running so I left them alone only to see them log out fully....  
---
My apologies. Though "almost" every asset is still a few thousand assets. Almost all the _settlement_ tiles would be acceptable, providing it is implemented carefully.
---
Ron Pearlman was playing the part of a Vault-Tec chairman. The mug I own that certifies it as being official Vault-Tec merchandise wasn't actually produced by Vault-Tec Industries. Similarly, the trailer's "promise" of rebuilding America is supposed to help feed that aforementioned contrast.
---
The game is _far_ from perfect. If I thought it was perfect, I wouldn't say that the servers can't handle that many moving, rotating, complex objects. I do think, however, that the story is about average and that the lonely, dead world works to the game's advantage. It creates a unique, eerie, sad post apocalypse. I've given NUMEROUS reasons explaining why human NPCs would be HIGHLY DETRIMENTAL to the story. Unless they change the _entire_ plot in _every_ way and rerecord 80% per cent of the voice lines to suit that new plot and change almost _all_ the quests to suit that new plot, then human NPCs _can never work._ if they DO change everything, it may be an improvement. 
---
Another alternative is that, after finishing Scorched Earth (or whichever quest pertains to the Scorchbeast Queen), humans start moving into Appalachia, and then servers are set up in a way where players who have finished the final mission play in servers with growing populations and players who haven't play in the regular, dead world. This could work since it makes sense, doesn't ruin the game for new players and could give a chance for real change and growth in the Wasteland. Rose could recruit some of the newbies as Raiders and over time rebuild her empire, making the Savage Divide a truly terrifying area that you need to traverse carefully to avoid the Raiders. Thanks to the automated systems, new human settlers could rebuild the Brotherhood of Steel and the Responders. Free States is more of an ideology than a faction, so they could rebuild quickly. The Enclave might be tricky, possibly best if it remains a player only faction. This could allow more missions and some true end-game content. It would even make joining Factions a little easier too and could definitely help bring life to the wastes without ruining the vibes, y'know? So it CAN work.
---
If they add them I won't stop playing, but I can sure say that I'll lose the limited respect I hold for the game of it's not implemented carefully as hell
---
Be prepared to farm *a lot* to repair your t51.
---
I'll stick to a t60 because of that. That, and the fact that when you're rockin a bloodied build most of the overall damage resistance comes from Emergency Protocols + lone wanderer + psycho, the 55 DR you get from jumping to a t51 is not worth the increased repair costs.
---
You just got hate for this, thats all.
---
You're whining to the wrong crowd, we like this game. You moron.
---
I‚Äôll give you 2 guesses
---
Sounds goodüëçüèª
---
Razorgrain Sake would be cool. 
---
Or what about Pruno! That would make sense in this world. And you could make it out of any fruit or veggie, but it just takes a ton of it and always makes you black out but you wake up at the Penetentiary every time.
---
Also you would need a special brewing station that's just a toilet with a black plastic garbage bag in it.
---
I'm saddened that you were so lazy that you didn't compare images of both. :(
---
Congratulations Bethesda wants another blow job want do you go accommodate them lol
---
This sounds like a commercial.
---
FYI, I've never seen a comment that unironically used the phrase "kiddo" that didn't get downvoted to hell for sounding douchey. Even if you have a point I doubt you'll get much agreement when you present it like you just did.
---
Anytime, yw :)
---
I put my generator on the roof of my camp. I have never needed to repair it. 
---
YEAH LIKE MAKE THE GAME GOOD EHUE /s 
---
Wow you cats people and didn't even have to aim.
---
Amateur. 
---
Furthermore 800 is enough IMO, just acknoledge your junk needs, sell the excess, don't stack tons of loots... Learn inventory managing in general ;) I'm not even using power armor and have no problem so far since the last stash increase.
---
You're the same type of person who would shit all over them if they apologized, so who cares? They're just going to keep working on the game instead of trying to pander to people who will never be happy, as they should.
---
Honestly if they apologized I would be extremely happy cause that would mean they‚Äôre realizing they made a mistake but all they are saying is that it was interesting lol
---
I wouldn't know I'm waiting on them to fix a big that has made it to much of a headache to play I haven't o been able to play for over a month I keep hoping that it will get fixed
---
I was walking by Billings Homestead and got the quest pop up so I decided to take it to see what plans it would drop. It‚Äôs a bit of a lame workshop so I wasn‚Äôt worried about anyone popping up. Cleared the enemies and decided to go ahead and put up a structure for turrets to do the defense quest. As I was building a couple of walls and floors, some level 132 jerk jumped up and one-shot me in the face. He didn‚Äôt even take the workshop or defend it. He waited there and killed me two more times. Fortunately, I always dump my junk immediately after claiming a workshop. So maybe he was mad I didn‚Äôt drop anything. Still annoying though.
---
Nope, not at all.  If someone has the indecency to mess with your stuff, they have it coming to them.    Only thing I would have done differently, is not stopping at just twice.  
---
This is the suggestion Im looking for. Ive gone to all the vendors and wiped them out.
---
Civil war pepper grinder lmfao
---
As a nonpower armor user, I **GREATLY** appreciate this.
---
 I'm sitting here staring at my Aesthetically pleasing(to me) Nuka Quantum x01 with Owl mask^hallowed^are^the^mothmen)    rotting-in-my-stashtracite, and carry my fat ass home Excavator set wondering what makes any armor better than the other.
---
Thank you kindly~

I'm having the same issue, although it sometimes doesn't crash.  The game will lock up, I'll click the "Wait for program to respond" button, and after about 15 seconds, it'll start up again.  Sometimes it crashes, sometimes it'll continue.  Happens two or three times during queen fight -- but even if I'm lucky and it doesn't crash to desktop, it'll often get out of sync, and stop registering my damage.  I can shoot and expend ammo, but enemies heal all the damage instantly.  Others can see me shooting, but it's not doing any damage.
