The hybrid chems are your best bet here. I always just craft Grape Mentats and Psychobuff and that counts as 5 chems.
---
---
---
No you are thinking of bufftats or a different game. Lol.
---
I posted about the same thing a couple of days ago. Go in your pip boy and look under the DAILY section. You should see Repeatable: Operation Tidy
---

---
Select it if it isnt selected, or de-select it and re-select it. It may take 24 hours for it to reset so you can do it. It did for me.
---
We weren't all jackasses :(
---
For any Fallout 1st Subscribers, what convinced you to spend your money OTHER than the Scrapbox?
---
There are some exceptions though, such as the golden combat knife. It has a completely different mesh and texture, but it can still be applied to already existing combat knives.
---
Try to unlock all of the radium mods.  That keep you busy for a few months. LOL
---
The only scammers one should be aware of is bethesda employees like you.
---
Would you have subscribed if not for the scrap box? If so, which other Fallout 1st aspect was worth the $13/month or $100 for you?
---
Ps4 does that crap, I always leave 150+ gbs open.  It happens with multiple games.
---
Yay
---
1: Unplug your PS4.
---
2: Remove it from your entertainment center.
---
3: Open window.
---
4: Toss PS4 out the window.
---
5: Go buy an Xbox.
---
&gt; I'm a 1st subscriber 
---
just how do you live without a spine ?
---
I'm pretty sure they just fixed this in the patch today, no?
---
Trippy
---
Thanks. Yea. Had Bolstering,  power and WWR. My prime piece....
---
i obtained the strangler heart PA and vault 94 was still miserable
---
ill rather do mythic kiljaeden again
---
I was really upset about the main menu until they finally added a separate volume control. Trying to talk to my team between NW matches while that music fought to overpower their voices was just ridiculous.
---
Yeah.
---
I‚Äôm running a pistol right now and being bloodied is a neccessity I find.  
---
I have a bloodied six shooter and every bullet needs to kill when it comes to mobs (particularly ghouls and super mutants), otherwise I‚Äôm pretty much certified dead.  (Though with ghouls I can jump using marsupial and reload...super mutants warlords, overlords and the type...not so much).
---
I love the build and the gameplay tbh (VATS is a must in close quarters) but the pistols need to be stronger to make up for the lower fire rate...and also the stronger pistols need the option of suppressors like the lever action rifle.
---
The "Break it Early Test Application" before launch obviously didn't really help much with bugs, etc.  A Beta for Wastelanders likely wouldn't do much either, except for revealing spoilers.
---
Unless you can post a link to this I looked up and down the patch notes and didn‚Äôt see anything related
---
Highlights for me:
---
- Chinese set looks decent, still wanted BoS but Chinese is neat
---
- shoulder pads for 1st ranger armour to resemble the Elite/Advanced of New Vegas. Better be free to 1sters
---
- Nuka Cherry armour skin looks okay, at least it's new
---
- Matt style liberty Prime PA skin better be free to those of us that bought the originals. I'm not paying 1800 atoms for a slightly different shade of a skin I already splashed 1800 on and I shouldn't have to
---
All these bright, shiny, pristine wallpapers look like shit. Like walking into some gaudy showhome all the time going to players camps. There should be a weathered version of each.
---
That bizarre coloured armour skin looks atrocious. Hard no.
---
Dude stop with the hypotheticals. Frog legs is annoying and unfair to go against, it's that simple. Everytime I run it to one. The mood instantly changes because they jump around. 
---
It's my biggest gripe with this amazing gamemode. 
---
Amazing how much someone who supposedly doesn't even use frog legs defends it.
---
The gamemode would be so much better without out. 
---
Like I mentioned, it definitely deters people form playing. It shouldn't be a perk man.
---
I think the scrapbox should be applied for every players.
---
I think tents should be reworked so that they don't persist upon switching servers, and also should be made something available for everybody, and also they should be upgradable for atoms, allowing different looks (another point of spending atoms) and maybe improved convenience (now comes with B.E.N.C.H‚Ñ¢ - Basic Equipment Needed for Character Happiness)
---
I think that the subscription should offer some atoms and maybe some cool outfit/camp thingy here and there, and there should be no in-game advantages out of having it. I'm not certain if I plan to renew my subscription, but making these convenience items part of regular gameplay of all players would make me certainly renew it. I want to support the game and I don't want to support questionable business practices.
---
Then everyone would just equip Unyielding to maximize luck and just go on a safe-hitting spree.
---
Even the reddit community is super divided on it, and reddit makes up such a tiny amount of the actual player base, if the hatred isnt even unanimous here then its a lot less of an issue then you think it is.  
---
  
---
Especially since rumor has it that sales of Fallout 1st are actually higher than bethesda expected them to be
---
rip for u/teightro
---
Sorry, I was looking at the revised hotfix notes from 11/14:
---
Exploit:¬†Fixed a pair of exploits that could allow players to duplicate items.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/26emkOnXeAk2KzkzQpq2xb/fallout-76-hotfix-notes-november-14-2019
---
So an update that is 5 gigs requires what? 90 gigs? That's insane.
---
Before asking for a fix, ask 1 qualifying question, does it affect Fallout 1st or the Atomic shop?  If no, then good luck.
---
It's usually the other way around, that's the truly sad part.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

---
They are harder and the "bug" that shows challenges as completed without giving you the atoms has been angering me for weeks now. There is no real good way to report it and tickets you submit on the support website aren't answered. They do this to sell more atoms i assume. Money grabbers!
---
Wow thanks man. So according to the datamined info the chameleon legendary effect,  power armor stealth boy torso mod and the chameleon mutation only give you a "visual stealth field." They have absolutely no effect on your ability to remain undetected.
---
Beside the point. What has been causing the influx in client crashes then? We sign in to their servers so in the end we are crashing from their connection.
---
Cool...see you later!!!   And just don't come back with anymore posts while your at it!!!
---
It‚Äôs usually right away.
---
Like a year long beta...like FO76 should have had.
---
I'm not sure if such a thing is in their business model.  I mean, this is when they did the beta for FO76 last year, that wasn't a beta at all.
---
You should have gotten them as soon as you bought them.
---
Where's your raider flair
---
Fanboy, nope. 
---
But he knows his spices.
---
Comment as in what?
---
Done, and done.
---
Not really I‚Äôve been busy with wrestling
---
Reset your game if you still don‚Äôt have them
---
I'll take your entire stock
---
it looks fake in game
---
So if we see people requesting explosive radiums in the forums and discords be wary eh? Good to know think I'll just hold on to my others as someone just bought one yesterday from me hmm....
---
Crafting bufftats will check 3 objectives, buffout, mentats and bufftats. And yes it is stupid. I would enjoy the strength buff a lot if I could mass craft it.
---
Yes, this would save thousands of button pushes.
---
My poor thumb üòû
---
I used PayPal, and the money has been taken from my account. Here's hoping Microsoft support can be of any help
---
Class freak reduces the damage you take by 75% (you take +6%~ damage)
---
Strange in numbers increases the damage reduction for your party members only
---
max level crickets?  Those things are pretty good xp.
---
Im on Xbox, I also submitted a ticket as well
---
If you want to use other weapons then do it nobody is stopping you.
---
I haven't seen/heard of that but if its true I hope it comes soon, our thumbs need a rest!
---
You're not, hopefully they fix this soon.
---
nice thanks for the post and take an updoot
---
Good to know, very informative üëçüèª
---
I said "pretty much instantly." It takes about 5-6 shots form the JE Auto Railway. The Auto Railway fires off it's whole clip in less than a second. Here's a clip of me killing a Behemoth- https://xboxclips.co/chiiy/27c8896d-3417-4482-95f7-20c04aee6443
---
Welp, looks the party is coming to an end.
---
V1.30 release notes today say, ‚ÄúArmor: Fixed an issue that prevented Armor from taking condition damage during combat.‚Äù
---
It used to hang away from the body in the [stylized fashion that they did in New Vegas](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/641818401555087362/646506221129695234/latest.png?width=588&amp;height=499). Now they hug your body, and bunches up under your legs while you walk like they're made of plastic bags.
---
Thank you very much. Often wondered how it all stacked/added up.
---
Ok I‚Äôll message you in a few
---
Interesting, thank you!
---
Link requires me to be logged in to imgur and to verify new account with a phone number. No thanks, please post unrestricted links like normal.
---
I have been saying this since they delayed Wastelanders update..
---
They must launch PTS BEFORE launching Wastelanders update or even if PTS isn‚Äôt ready yet.. they should release Wastelanders update on phases first on pc for 2 weeks after that for consoles to eliminate bug / glitch as soon as they can

Something we agree on!
---
Every day, 3 times a day for rewards
---
For me the chameleon mutation is at least as good and maybe better that 15 points of AGI.
---
I see this periodically on PS4, for me I need to fully quit the game, close the application, and restart it for my character tab to reappear again. Freaked me out the first time it happened though.
---
I don‚Äôt know if helps, but if you reloading while sneaking the primary effect works..don‚Äôt ask me why lol
---
I tried it once. About to do a slow shut down of the game and my xbox. I was scared they deleted everyone's characters that weren't their first
---
I noticed an absurd use of energy while power armor, in like 5 minutes I wasted 4 fusion core.
---
Also while using heavy weapon that consume fusion core, everytime I reload I get half of the previous magazine, until reach 1 ammo per load.  
---
WTF
---
This. I run 5 20% WW reduction armors. most fully modded rifles are 1.5lbs
---
[removed]
---
What makes you come to that conclusion? 
---
I see no correlation between "Stealth Field" effects and detection effects.
---
My experience has been, if anything, more solid. 
---
Im usually always the one dropping out. But thats bc of my horrible internet. My buddy however dropped out 5 times in ten minutes or so just trying to do the morgantown missions.
---
Uh, should I have added a /sarc/ tag?
---
I‚Äôm also trying to fill a display case, I ended up putting the beer hat and nukashine in to fill it up.
---
Idk what you mean by that. Mine looks perfectly fine. Now when I crouch walk it actually has physics to it and slides off the characters thigh when not moving.
---
Just agreeing with your point. I'd rather help folks out and make friends, than profit.
---
I'm a 1st subscriber and I say it shouldn't. In fact I don't think it should be unlimited period. If you give everyone an unlimited stash, good luck farming for resources.
---
Yep, I'm a dumbass and have done this before. I've gotten to the point where I either rename or Atom shop re-skin the weapons and armor I use regularly because it's too easy to gloss over things if you're on a mass trade in binge at the legendary scrip machine.
---
What does that mean? I tested a chameleon mutation build vs. Unyielding build.
---
The fact that the idiots of this sub downvoted even this comment proves how much of a cult this place is.
---
We sure are!
---
nope.. I am very careful about that..
---
ive never scripped something i was wearing or was marked as a favorite
---
Not before you dish out $200 you fucking freeloader! The devs constantly need revenue to keep developing! Small indie studio made a perfect game, ok? Give money, NOW!
---
Scrapbox should be for everyone!
---
It was definitely advertised day one. I don‚Äôt know if they removed that
---
A second fast travel point would probably make the subscription obsolete. I'd gladly settle for just a scrapbox and new content at this point.
---
I never noticed that I guess. But I haven't noticed any discounts.
---
yay
---
&gt; would be unfair to fallout 1st subscribers
---
Fuck em!
---
They have plenty of other features available.  
---
Furthermore, the scrap box was a dumb idea in the first place.  Scrap in stash should just have zero weight.  That would be a way better solution.
---
yall really still think these devs can get anything right lol, this game is dying and I don't expect Wastelanders to be any different than all the other poorly released content. I'd like to believe they can still turn it around, but I've lost hope and am realistic about it at this point. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me, cant get fooled again
---
You can never have too much communism. comrade.
---
Wow conpensates(ed) for downtime more than a couple hours of downtime frequently - just from maintence taking a little longer, etc... 
---
My account got hacked and they had it fixed in like 2 hrs, not
---
2 months, so i didn‚Äôt ask for it. But if they dropped the ball like that they‚Äôd probably give you 6mos because holy shit does that look bad.
---
Where are you seeing 3-star weapons for 300 caps?
---
I‚Äôll buy every single one you have for that price. 
---
7.5 caps per scrip?  I‚Äôll take that deal all day.
---
But imagine if super duper did kick in when crafting a few hundred of something....oh man lol
---
Elder‚Äôs Battlecoat
---
Glowing skeleton costume. 
---
It cost me everything.
---
I 100% agree with a beta. Whenever it does finally launch, the amount of people logging in are going to crash the game. Just watch! If they are truly trying to polish it off then a beta defiantly does make sense. 
---
I‚Äôll gladly try it out as well should they go that route.
---
Wastelanders is literally the only hope for this game, and even then nothing will make this game a success now, which is sad but hopefully wastelanders will give Fallout fans some enjoyment. Ya I agree, there should be a PC test server for this stuff so every update the game gets will be polished.
---
Wouldn't fit in the pre-war Fallout world at all.
---
It helps. I don't understand most of the complaining that goes on around here..
---
You need five addictions to get the full junkies effects (10% each) and you need to plan which ones you get. Don't get addicted to chems you actually want to use because these will often have negative side effects on your build. For example a melee or heavy weapons character would never want to get addicted to buffout because it lower your strength, instead going for mentats or med-x. You can take the chems you are addicted to to remove the side effects and still get your bonus but that's a lot of chems and you can only be under the influence of one chem at a time plus booze and food. If you get addicted to something bad accidentally you have to take addictol and redo your addictions . TLDR a proper junkies build takes planning and lots of chems.
---
Noticed something similar on PS4 as well. The lights that were previously on the wall just disappeared, not stored, not scrapped, just gone and my camp budget did not budge near as I could tell. My camp budget is bleeding edge full, but not over.
---
Tell me about it... All about risk and reward...
---
Radtstag outfit and the sack hood with straps. Don't copy me.
---
It's not a new one. It's the original one the game had at launch. They changed it to the one we had until today when NW launched.
---
Well, it was the ranger coat, matched with Gage's Eyepatch, and the scarlet sniper hat. Since they ["upgraded"](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/641818401555087362/646516866856124456/COAT_MEME.png) the coat this morning tho I don't really like it. I was waiting to buy the santa beard to complete the old cowboy look, but oh well.
---
I like it.
---
Currently, I'm fine mostly with what I have but I want to maximize my loadout. I have to shift lots of my SPECIAL points and I'll be forced to move most of my 12 points from Strength to other stats which will greatly reduce my carry capacity and junks, meds, and food would become heavier.
---
That's basic error correction and is pretty common.
---
Its so if the update fall's you don't have to download everything again
---
I want those issues fixed as well, but there are constant posts about them, as well as numerous comments in this very thread, so I don't feel that I need to parrot them
---
Yeah I was feeling that too. I'm just gonna go back to being sober lol
---
Silver shroud or ranger outfit
---
Classic!
---
- Lumberjack Outfit
---
- Red Bandana
---
- Black-Rim Glasses
---
- Old Fisherman's Hat
---
- Black Shovel Backpack
---
Bathrobe and Nukashine helmet.
---
I've made some small changes recently for NW so my current set up is a bit different than what I usually use. Here's what I usually use- [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwIOAgMECg4BAQEALk8D6AEBQAMnAvIBAfABA8QBA3sDEAPGAQNvBXwDgAEBQQELAzUBpQEDkgEDNgLSAQG7AQMZAdsBAwA=](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwIOAgMECg4BAQEALk8D6AEBQAMnAvIBAfABA8QBA3sDEAPGAQNvBXwDgAEBQQELAzUBpQEDkgEDNgLSAQG7AQMZAdsBAwA=)
---
Everyone who plays this game regularly should upvote this. If Wastelanders tanks we may have no more Appalachia. This needs more upvotes
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
You don‚Äôt sign Eula‚Äôs and they are not legal contracts.
---
What he clicked or did not has no bearinmone way or another.
---
Hah!  Who does.
---
Do you have power to the cannon?  It helps!!
---
The damage will be noticeably worse than Bloodied.  Nothing is "as good".  
---
The advantage of Junkies is it deals decent damage without needing to run around at 19% health.  But you can also achieve this with any other full health build using AA, furious, TS weapons.
---
That's pretty cool! Where in the world would you get gage's eyepatch though?
---
With sunglasses
---
There's barely any people left playing Nuclear Winter, there are much better Battle Royale games out there, if that's what people are interested in. So it's normal that you keep seeing the same people over and over again. Happens to me too on PS4.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve checked that but it still doesn‚Äôt work:
---
I thought of that but it just disappears.
---
It was part a of the raider scavver pack. :)
---
There are some really good tutorials on here for doing it. It's actually a lot of fun. In all the fallout games I usually just sold chems but it adds a new dimension to it and it's a nice alternative to a low health build. Throw in some vanguards armor and auto stim and some choice food and perks and you can file out some good damage without being afraid you'll die every second.
---
Hmm. Not sure then
---
Okay if there's so little people left then what am I supposed to do and how the hell did captinnoob get groped with noobmaster 3000 that one time?
---
You give a player new features, they will find bugs and exploits faster than an employee on a test server. Whether it be purposely or on accident, they didnt make the game, they think about it from a different perspective. Not to mention the number of people who would do it for free vs paid employees(look at the FO4 mudding community vs you sitting at your desk ar your day job)
---
#Wastelanders needs a beta. Period.
---
Same thing happened to me &amp; I almost had a heart attack lol. What fixed it was closing app &amp; restarting my PS4 üëç
---
Minecraft has a FO mod pack.  The mob known as "drowned" look like ghouls and throw tridents.
---
Pastor's vestments, battered fedora and sunglasses. All. The. Time.
---
@th3silv3rshroud Where do you get that?
---
Hard to detect has " Mod Detection Sneak Skll + 15"  and other sources of  Mod Detection Sneak Skll have a higher number. I see no reason it shouldn't stack to at least the highest number we see available.
---
Because... there's very few people playing... I just told you.
---
&gt; It's almost super simple to find and fix bugs like that. I have been programming as a hobby over 10 years. 
---
Bwahahaha!
---
You wins the interrubes with this one.
---
This is great!!! Please be a real post and someone took up the name!
---
Gotcha but imo that's a bit of a shame.  Your list is seen as a sort of 1 stop shop for all current bugs, you provide a valuable service, so consciously excluding what are probably the most sever bugs seems to present a fractured view of what the community wants to get fixed.    
---
But hey you do you and thanks for this list every patch.  It sucks it's so long.
---
I might go with that but it is quite hard to get good unyielding armor parts that after visiting most of the stores around mid part of the map to high level areas these past few days, also joining events with legendaries like slaying SBQ, Urnium Fever, Free Range, and One Violent Night - I only got one unyielding. Well, I'm also looking for good handheld rifle or ballistic heavy automatic guns that have anti-armor or bloody effects without explosive effect but can't find one.
---
On fo4, my favorite is the explosive shotgun but without the perks and equipment, I might kill my self in tight areas if I choose the same build in fo76.
---
It was an Atomic Shop feature a while back.
---
that sucks I was hoping to find one for myself :P
---
The tent and scrap box should be available for everyone. However, 1st people should be able to freely place scrap boxes in their camps and workshops and "adventure mode only" people would have to keep theirs in their tent. This way there isn't any "boo hoo what am I paying for?!" From the 1sters.
---
Indeed!
---
Thanks I appreciate so much the reply‚Äôs, let hoping they fix that, is a good perk at least
---
ahh cool. Thanks. Only reason I saw this was because I started playing my melee character again and found out today I couldn't craft buffout for him.
---
A Podcast I listen to mentioned someone they grew up with and how they used to say they only trusted the three B's
---
Bethesda, Bioware, and Blizzard.
---
What a difference a decade makes.
---
Podcast clip for anyone who is curious:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R8SyNZQaPg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R8SyNZQaPg)
---
I'm sure it'll come back in no time. Just gotta be patient. :)
---
I have not played Nuclear Winter since June and I have this problem too, so unless you meant to have never ever played it before I guess there are no real workaround.
---
well i've got a whole whopping 5 atoms so it may take a while...
---
Very different than the route I've been on for my [Junkie Commando build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=67c9778&amp;d=es2en0ea0e20eg1pi0ph0pg0p00pp2sb2sg2lu2lt2l71a30a00ao0ar1s71ic2ib3c72c81cu0cm0eh1&amp;w=&amp;m=cf391&amp;nw=&amp;n=Commando%20Junkie). I've embedded a lot of QOL perks to be able to take all the chems and drink all the booze with minimal side effects (going in on the role I suppose). I'm pretty much 100% PVE and haven't gone down the NW path yet, and I suck at PVP.
---
I've never tried Ricochet... how has your experience been with it?
---
I genuinely don‚Äôt get how bugs just return like the sentry gun sound, if you patched it once already HOW IS IT BACK THEN
---
What is the max stats you can have? I believe I have read somewhere before that the max is around 25. I tried to find it but can't find anymore.
---
Also I believe your armor are getting unequipped when you're inside a power armor, unlike in fo4 where you can enjoy their effects while you're inside a PA.
---
with platform u are playing ?
---
They are, or at least they are in the U.S. That have been successfully upheld in many court cases.
---
Another bag situation?
---
I feel like it's more pay for efficiency.. I mean they roped me in as soon as I learned how the tent worked.. Shits OP af lol.
---
Yeah, OP's experience is uncommon but not unheard of. It's certainly happened to both me and my wife.
---
Like the first B.E.T.A did anything anyways, u do realise they don‚Äôt give a fuck about this update, they just wanna see how many MACROtransactions they can shove down ur throat
---
 with platform u are playing ?
---
It's alright friend, just keep up with your dailies, and weeklies, and I'm sure you'll have a war chest ready for when it comes back.
---
It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs online. In fallout 4 you laugh at the glitches and reload your save without losing any progress, in 76 if the game crashes nobody‚Äôs laughing.
---
I just can't believe the size of the patch, considering how very, very little it does.
---
Hunters longcoat, black backpack, black cowboy hat, patrolman sunglasses
---
How exactly am I supposed to keep grinding? You're ether with noobmaster 3000 or your against noobmatser 3000? I have no idea who he is but captinnoob was able to play with him so I need to find out who he is so I can play with him.
---
UPDATE: I had to restart the game and counsel 3 times before it showed up. But looks like its back for good. Thank you
---
Must be a lack of consumer rights laws in your country!
---
Full vanguard robot set with the mechanist helmet lol
---
My bad I thought it was new but still very surprising
---
Good post, This happens to me too
---
Not really, it‚Äôs a licensing agreement and you willfully agreed to it lol. The people in your country must lack intelligence so your government bails them out when they agree to stupid things.
---
Yeah, oddlyspecific# or whatever do
---
Thor he‚Äôs back! The kid on the TV just called me a dickhead again.
---
If the e.u.l.a involves giving up legal rights it is itself an illegal agreement and non binding.
---
I also have a couple potentially dumb questions as a casual solo player. Have not done raids but need acid. Can this be done in adventure mode? I have zero interest in going to the pvp side. Iv seen there‚Äôs something like an easy mode for raids.
---
‡≤†_‡≤†
---
We have received different free stuff weekly that I have noticed
---
Ricochet3 is a great defensive perk. It lets you avoid damage from almost 1/5 of ranged attacks(18%). That includes scorched beasts sonic attacks, angler fire balls and any other form of non-melee attacks.
---
IMO avoiding 1/5 of attacks is more valuable than getting a 1/5 boost to your overall HP. A 1/5 boost to my HP would require 11 endurance points or Lifegiver3(4 end points) + 2 endurance points.
---
Great. These look so much more realistic to use in a kitchen then the display cases.
---
What part of blizzards EULA involves giving up legal rights?
---
Patched out. It stops everytime they open the emote menu.
---
Try medium setting and some ini tweaks, my game looks pretty close to ultra setting without the overkill numbers of it and the sole area making me see a struggle is a specific area in whitespring ( not a wide one so i never really meet any issue )
---
Wastelanders isn't releasing until Q1 of next year, so as late as April.
---
Look I don't hate the guy I;m just trying to say that's it's a waste of time playing against him and his goons when I chould just be one of the goons.
---
I play on 10 and deal with this and worse all the time. 
---
If it‚Äôs windows 7, it‚Äôs not just windows 7.

This guy has been posted multiple times and I always think back to this scene.
---
Survival mode was removed weeks ago if that's what you're referring to. You should be able to do this in adventure or a private world.
---
:/ Gee who could have ever guessed he was coming back after making such a HUGE deal over everything... *eye roll*
---
Usually anything that waves the right to a refund within the 30 days allotted [yes this includes digital products], or anything that prevents you from suing the company. Nintendo are definitely in breach of the former at the moment.
---
no outift.  camo underarmour and camo combat armor. and a white painted face
---
I haven't noticed any...
---
I think I won't go that far. Just a single run in Harpers Ferry with super mutants or scorched and selling diluted meds are enough for me to deplete those 1,400 caps of vendors daily. If I come across junks that contains being used in high quantity and those that are rare including steel, lead, acid, cloth, copper, plastic, nuclear waste, gears, spring, screws, ultracite, and flux, I want to bring as much as I can.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; High DPS isn't everything.  
---
Most of the time, offense is the best defense for me. If I could kill enemies before they have time to attack me, then I wouldn't have to worry about my health. But as of now, a few robots at the gate of Whitespring can kill me in just few hundreds of milliseconds even I'm several meters away from them.
---
This. People can‚Äôt pretend it has a large player base anymore and isn‚Äôt just trying to squeeze the piggies as much as possible while they can.
---
Neat.
---
Ew.
---
Great idea, I would love to make my own bunker!
---
It‚Äôs obviously the first. The sub fee proved it and anyone who won‚Äôt accept that is in naked, embarrassing denial.
---
I buy plans I don't have from vendors and it'll give them back some caps so I can sell them more stuff.
---
It‚Äôs definitely make or break for me. I‚Äôm not even playing till it comes out. If it‚Äôs not awesome then I‚Äôll fully move on. Best wishes on your beta. I truly hope this chapter is awesome!
---
Sincerely,
---
Down and Out in Appalachia
---
Jumping through it?
---
We can keep going if you want bruv
---
Since I was able to kill him few times, no he's not a cheaters. Just someone who plays a lot.
---
I've got a full van set now that I alternate with assasins for pvp. I'll continue to play with it a bit but I don't like doing pvp with the addictions. That's a no go so far.
---
What about a full suit of weightless armor and chameleon mutation?  Does that outclass the 15 points of agility an unyielding set gives at least?
---
Awesome. Thanks. I always get nervous asking questions, sometimes you just get downvoted for some reason. And this is 94 it‚Äôs referring to?
---
why talons mutation?
---
Or when it just never happens.
---
Wasn‚Äôt it supposed to come out in the summer? I know that‚Äôs when everyone was saying it was incoming.
---
I have the Same problem.   i even scrapped it and put a new one down and it still won't let me get any flares out of the box.    i checked my stash aswell as my inventory.    it's been like this for atleast since august for me.
---
dunno about strangler, but the normal Liberty Prime Skins apply to all other PA's.
---
I run a fist weapon for trash. If you do twisted muscles (as you aren‚Äôt really doing much ‚Äúaim‚Äù wise at the optimal range), you can do pretty well even without iron fist as a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to waste shells on you weapon‚Äù.
---
I remember when I was excited for patch day, seeing new cool stuff coming out like vending machines. Now patches are disapointments, nothing good comes out just small bug fixes with major bugs still in game.
---
Yea but isn‚Äôt that what everyone gets?
---
That's understandable, I don't comment much myself. And yeah its Vault 94.
---
Is recalling the assaultron(sheepsquatch) able to be done solo and if so at what level?
---
I dont know where else to ask this
---
Samurai outfit for my meele, enclave officer uniform and bowler for my heavy gunner, nukagirl for me pistol packin' mamma, science scribe and bowler for my medic, and one of the BOS uniform( the one with all the pockets) for my sneaky sniper.
---
None of this is below guaranteed a fact, just my interpretation of the datamine-
---
It looks like chameleon mutation has 0 effect on your ability to remain undetected from NPCs. 
---
There's no info in the datamine on whether your equipped carry weight has any influence on detection so it's still possible the weightless legendary effect may help.
---
Blizzards EULA doesn‚Äôt prevent you from pursuing legal action, it just forces you to go through arbitration first which is legally at least in the U.S. Also the refund thing for the subscription is different then a product return because it‚Äôs a service contract.
---
Upvoted because unintentionally(?) hilarious.
---
Nay
---
Also forgot to mention, do it on novice so there is no timer, get two people and bot has rad sponge equip, and ghoulish lvl3. If you have both, you keep regenerating your health and will NEVER need any stimpak or radaway wich is usefull.
---
Use melee and the exterminator perk and just bring the crickets to be in one spot and do not move from that spot. That way, you only have to loot them in one place and not have to run around to find them. Since you are on a team you can loot those that your friend killed,, so no need to both get a hit on hit. Just keep pressing the attack button. At first if you dobt know the layout, you might take 35 minutes or 40 minutes, but as you progress you will trim that to 20 minutes easily. Dont forget to only unlock the engineering, and as soon as they  stop, fast travel out. Do not do anything to progress further while in engeneering.
---
Are you referring to a specific bug or the game in general
---
Free indefinitely or for a limited time? Game is currently uninstalled while I wait for Wastelanders.
---
There is a recipe for Bufftats, there isn't one for Buffout.
---
Well that‚Äôs not very immersive is it?
---
No, it's dumb. Think about what you need instead of collecting useless crap.
---
And if possible do it on a private server. Waaaaaay less lag.
---
gotta use that triple dipple check homie
---
I like your reasoning on this, going to have to check it out. Thanks!
---
As a WVian I can attest that WW does not exist. But I‚Äôm obsessed with the mascot.
---
***Noobmaster...***
---
Much as I'd be willing to join test servers, they'd probably hate my guts after I point out every little issue I run across, right down to floating rocks, flickering walls, and missing textures.
---
Exactly. It's blank. I posted this 8 hours ago and LadyDevann commented that this has been fixed. Apparently not.
---
Also the joke is that the patch notes ection is blank; even Bethesda knows how useless this patch was.
---
I think you're wrong about the stealthboy. It doesn't stack with what you already have, it replaces it with it's own values. You can test this yourself if you have a high stealth set.
---
Ranger coat, black cowboy hat, shovel backpack, and a big mustache.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie, it kinda hurts that it took a whole patch cycle to do a bunch of minor issues like this. Was there anything even worthwhile fixed in this patch?
---
Nah they'll just take your money. We all paid for FO76 it seems they don't care. I've been asking for an Alien Blaster buff since the game came out, they don't care.
---
I dont' tthink I claimed the stealthboy stacks with anything else.
---
Good thing is you dont have to and it wont affect anything at all!
---
Was wondering about that new "shelf". So Do you add junk items as you would the display cases?
---
So Lets see ...
---
" Releasing a game for full price, when it was so buggy that some quests  couldn't even finish, broken textures, copied code from fallout 4 that  included KNOWN bugs in it, etc. "
---
Its Bethesda it was bound to happend and still everyone was like suprised Pikachu.
---
" Switching the canvas bag for a nylon, and then attempting to give a ($5)  refund that's only in the atom shop, meaning it would go right back to  them. It took a lot of pestering for them to give the actual product. "
---
I Agree, it took way to long for litterly everything.
---
" Nuka-dark rum was sold for $80 and it turned out to be in a cheap plastic bottle, not glass, and not worth the price."
---
Not Game relevant.
---
"Charging an absurd amount ($276) for a "leather" jacket that looked like it was made of tarp."
---
See Above.
---
"Moldy T-51b helmets ($150), I don't think I need to explain why that's bad."
---
Not Bethesda's fault. Gamestop had them badly stored (all of the affect helmets where Gamestop exyclusiv)
---
" Adding micro-transactions that allowed players to gain advantages."
---
Bad Move, i Agree.
---
"**18 DOLLARS FOR BLUE. FUCKING. PAINT.** I shouldn't need to point out how that's an issue."
---
Dunno what you are Reffering.
---
I wouldn't trust this post, it doesn't line up with actual tests. I run a 5 cham set and did testing with stealth. Ended up with one harder to detect, one shrouded, a shadowed mod, 4x ultra lite (sleek and muffled didn't make a difference, think obsolete by speed demon and escape artist), one dense mod, and the fixer. It's better than unyielding in that you can re-stealth yourself if you go into danger. It's so good it's almost cheating. I'm not talking kind of good, I mean ghouls at the clubhouse can surround you and you stay in caution good.
---
With hard bargain gold and silver trades at more than 1 cap to vendor bots, like many other goods, and otherwise I do not find a lot of uses for it to encourage you to burn it up in crafting (although I am not far enough in the game). With the scrapbox you should be able to hold a large amount of it now.
---
So in my opinion an alternate currency without a cap limit and that is not ammo could be useful for trade for players that hit cap limit at 30k. There is alt accounts and mules but that feels like more effort than many players want to invest, and maybe they want five unique characters.
---
So I am purely looking for something to increase player convenience. If you want caps you still have to convert it, but loading a few hundred gold scrap to the vendor bot is a quick way to hit vendor bot cap for the day. Then sell bulk materials useful for ammo or crafting to other players via vendors.
---
Anybody thinking Bethesda is even paying a little bit of attention clearly has their head stuck deep in the sand
---
The subscription for the private servers was known about before the game was released
---
Surveyor outfit, fisherman's hat, black sunglasses.
---
Ratty dress mostly, fashionable sunglasses. Different hats. I also like my nuka girl outfit but tromping around in heels makes little sense to me. Elders battlecoat is pretty bad-ass looking and I also like my Halloween getup from time to time. 
---
Currently sporting a civil war era dress I just picked up...not sure how I feel about it yet.
---
Oh I took bonus to sneak meaning stacked.
---
Sorry for your loss. Try renaming the stuff you want to keep and add an * at the beginning of the name. That way it sorts to the top of your inventory and might give a visual clue not to sell it. 
---
Hope that helps!
---
I think its limited.
---
I‚Äôm with you, I thought I read on this subreddit that they nixed it because of PC.
---
Slow travel, you have to lead with the shots.
---
Same issue. Never worked for me and nothing I‚Äôve done to remedy it has worked.
---
&gt;How about they hire a QA team to do it.
---
As long as they don't need me to move, I'd do that job for them in a heart beat. For all my complaints about FO76 as of late, I really do want this game to succeed. Which is what makes it even more irritating when they do stupid shit to make the game look worse. They also really need to hire whomever it is that does those unofficial patches I've had to install for both Skyrim and FO4.
---
So 'Harder to Detect While Sneaking' does stack if I read that correctly?
---
Is there a water park it was a stand in for?
---
Copies
---
No need to rush, putting together a few goods set is the endgame, not killing the SBQ. I started by using all 1 star unyielding, which is easy relatively, then as I go I replace them gradually with better pieces. Explosive shotgun has been nerfed to the ground but it‚Äôs still fun, don‚Äôt worry about killing yourself, it‚Äôs pretty weak now. Put on Fireproof you can survive point blank.
---
I‚Äôve found you
---
I hope they patch it cause it was a waste of caps.
---
He's in a lot of them, him and street101, few others too.
---
I think 'Escape Artist' has a small cooldown. If you are in third person you will go briefly invisible when it activates. If you spam your sneak to fast that doesn't happen.
---
I have my girl in the drifter outfit with the newsboy cap ‚Äî which happens to be the same color as the drifter outfit, so I was happy about that lol. She‚Äôs also wearing black framed glasses and a small backpack.
---
Is that you giant =\]
---
Btw... Does anyone have any addictol?
---
I cant say for sure but it looks like it does.
---
Yea I just remember seeing it mentioned about features talked about for wastelanders early on but shot down, not sure why.  I'd assume the keyboard and mouse vs controller and may NW hackers
---
Reminds me of when I used to work at a children's amusement park. Never did try, but I regularly wanted to see how long it would take someone to notice if I changed my job title on my name tag from "ride operator" to "babysitter." 
---
On the other hand, the adults were worse than the kids, so maybe I should have tried changing it to "adultsitter." Doesn't sound very G rated though.
---
Elders Battlecoat and Sack Hood or straight jacket, prisoner collar and Tin-foil hat, both with  Keep Out backpack.
---
&gt;Tactical Turtleneck is for commies
---
LLLANAAAA
---
Well i'm sorry I'm level 70 and i'd like to not take 1000 years to get the other 40 levels.
---
Yep! Just tested it.
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
I did tell you I was me when you were reading my post to me n' dead earlier. :P
---
I told you that u/maybe-some-thyme was an ass and a half
---
I love to try and get them. My record is two on the same day: one on top of the world, one in Flatwoods. I even took pictures. I eat them, because cake.
---
Until recently I've run 4 chameleon and 1 cloaking. All shadowed leather and ultra light. And it never worked that well. What the hell am I doing wrong?
---
Yes!
---
Leather coat , green hood with urban scout mask
---
You are a combo breaker. I gave everyone a 'like', but there is no like for you.
---
This game can not and never will be able to win back it's player base. They have done everything in their power to screw there hardcore supporters. The only thing Bethesda should do with fo76 at this point is recall every single copy and burn them, then give their players the refunds they actually want.
---
Can't comment on XB sorry, but on PS it's immediate.
---
Here's how mine are set- ultra, high, high, ultra, high
---
Every slider max, fov 80
---
I don‚Äôt think the info on chameleon not stacking for creatures is accurate.
---
I run a full set of chameleon htd wood &amp; there is a difference between 1 piece &amp; 5, but take it as you will
---
I agree that I do believe it is the upper guys like Zenimax but when people complain about this game and if they make threats its always to Bethesda so my complaint is that if we are indeed to the point where people step down it should be to the people who get fingers pointed at them. Unless they release a statement about it being Zenimax or someone else.
---
You on PC? I made a mod for that:
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/451](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/451)
---
THE RACOONS ARE DOING THEIR BEST BE GRATEFUL
---
Yeah. I wish more enemies spawned in general. It's boring going to do  Line in the Sand or Census Violence, for example, only to have 3 enemies spawn every 3 minutes, who proceed to get instagibbed by the 5 other players there.
---
I have tried it with my optimal gunslinger. Are you benefitting from stealth! My 10mm does better crowd control than my revolvers.
---
No blue screens, but get stuck in longest loading screens, can't walk even few meters before screen freezes, enemies appear out of thin air, and so on.
---
Before update everything was running smoothly. üòî
---
No more than 80-100. But punch bowls always have it, even those with a sign that says 'totally not nukashine' on them.
---
Trade up for a PS4pro and add a 4TB ext hardrive for about ¬£100.
---
Don't run cloaking, run 5 cham pieces. The harder to detect is a legendary effect you can roll on chameleon pieces, not the prefix.
---
Well that‚Äôs kind of the problem the quest isn‚Äôt there either
---
There's no evidence in the datamine that suggests chameleon has any effect on NPCs. The HTD could be the what makes the difference. It seems like HTD is stackable.
---
I would LOVE to fight Scorched Earth in Morgantown, going from roof to roof, dodging ghouls, being ambushed by a mirelurk queen...
---
it will release in testing phase
---
There‚Äôs a pic of the table that sure makes it look like it can be decorated as well!
---
Have you actually built a set &amp; tested it yourself to see?
---
I don't know how they do it, but Bethesda has a way for surprising me with their patches and side effects. It's like come on... You could at least respect and take care of those subscribers who only did it for the outfit...
---
They emptied it quite awhile ago. Dont see why they needed to remove the door. 
---
It used to have a bunch of prefab vault structures inside, but were removed when it got the 51 texture and was no longer vault purple.
---
I had to go through my inventory yesterday because my box was full. I plugged everything into Excel to find out what was weighing me down. I found I had 250 lbs of Fusion Cores, 75 lbs of inert flux, and 50 lbs of gunpowder.
---
I like porpoises.
---
If the playerbase drops to lower than a few thousands a day,  I'm pretty sure it will be cheaper to call it quits than to keep the servers/team on it.
---
Other than that I agree with you, the resources have been planned a long time ago and won't change drastically.
---
I like the plane.
---
Deathclaw King.
---
Quad Gamma Gun (+25) for pvp with non-PA players. Because your poison damage stack with huge rad damage. The combo of SH PA, Q25 Gamma and a pack of stealth boys is my nasty surprise for bloodied griefing kids that came for easy caps to my captured power plant.
---
VE .50 for pvp with PA players (no spinning, great rate of fire, 250 shots per reload, good healing effect). Obviously the gamma gun is useless for such rad-resistance.
---
For pve strangler heart dmg is a shit-tier: dmg buff is nothing for bullet-sponges and make lags.
---
Poison damage is a constant bonus to every hit (like vampire's effect). So you have to look for weapons with good fire rate with ammo capacity. Explosive effect doubles this so it is the best secondary star. As first star two shoot is really good. You loose pure damage (countered in pvp by armor and perk cards) but have more poison stack.
---

Wouldn‚Äôt each piece add x20 to the ‚Äústealth field‚Äù?

BOS heavy combat armor with a skeleton mask and a backpack and occasionally the sheepsquatch outfit
---
You make it or buy it.
---
Third times the charm
---
ok but i wanna use the shine not just drink to drink. but thanks for the prices.
---
im so called "business man" running around in my either white wolf or black fedora. black patrolman sunglasses, suspenders and slacks, and now complete with my aae tommy gun
---
Well it's a super duper Mart, not a train station or red rocket...
---
Don't procreate, please.
---
Does rad sponge only work if you have a teammate?
---
Private servers are way more stable and less laggy than running 94 on public servers.
---
With the one cloaking though. My thought at the time was, if I do get hit it's because I'm detected. So that would give me a temp chance to get back into caution. And I never found a good 3 star chameleon for the one limb lol.
---
yea true. i was thinking like a streamlining process somehow besides that. not really though out lol
---
Grind materials or buy it. I have ammo reduction perks and legendary effects so 5mm weighs nothing to me. I carry over 10k on me at all times
---
Use your camp personal computer and start the quest that way.
---
I would suggest the market but I never have any luck there, but  you may have better luck.
---
Junkies commando with energy is fun
---
damnnnn!!! yea i better get to work lol
---
I've built various different sneak sets but I've never done extensive testing. Based on my experience, my WL/HTD and Uny/HTD sets seemed to be better at avoiding detetion than my Chm/HTD set.
---
Its been this way for months.  If you had smoke grenades in your stash those would work, but at some point any new ones would just disappear.
---
Wastelanders is for sure the make-it-or-break-it point for me. I seriously hope they get it right this time because I love Fallout.
---
flexin is hard I know, but you weren't even a part of it
---
Right after they fix the bugs in Fallout 4.
---
Well If it's game related they will point you to the support page. For general information use info@bethsoft.com.
---
Also there are community managers, but I don't feel like tagging them, just to point you in the support page again.
---
I'm just curious, what's the issue with the ticket?
---
Oh yeah when I signed on today I got my machine gun turret targeting my Pink Flamingo and trying to destroy it is this a new feature pink flamingos are evil?
---
leather coat
---
cowboy hat
---
black/shovel backpack
---
old face long grey hair
---
cranky old bastard
---
Yes each piece should add 20 to the "stealth field" but how did you come to the conclusion that stealth field influences NPC detection?
---
Only the ones continually spamming the emote until it became an ear numbing cacophony. Worse in headphones.
---
I am saying I got a new piece of armor, compared it to why I had, equipped it because it was ‚Äúbetter‚Äù but didn‚Äôt realize I was replacing my chameleon piece. Yes I was sloppy.
---
Xbox
---
Yes. The Riot paint launched for a discounted Atom price before they got too much backlash and changed it 8 hours later.
---
Unlike other price mistakes that have usually been fixed in less than an hour.
---
Like the Bungalow being available for 150 atoms for about 60 minutes after the last patch launched.
---
Wastelanders‚Äôs content was likely set in stone months ago, long before any of the latest criticism could be taken into account. I think it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect it to bring any meaningful change.
---
I think Bethesda saw the shitstorm they created and the only thing they heard was ‚Äúfans want NPCs‚Äù so now they‚Äôre just going to copy/paste a bunch of NPCs and AI from past games, triple the amount of Atom Store content they offer, and call their game ‚Äúfixed.‚Äù
---
I hope I‚Äôm wrong, I truly do. But I‚Äôve seen it a million times. Publishers, in particular large ones, don‚Äôt see DLC as a way to fix their mistakes as they go, they just see dollar signs.
---
Yay, then I'd cancel my subscription.
---
Where in the data does it show that it doesn‚Äôt influence it? I seen no reference where it says either way.
---
I am going to have to from now on!
---
Yay, indeed.
---
My game is taking forever to download and update. üòë
---
Not to be a party pooper. But I don't think this would work.
---
There is always going to be bugs so rare that any test server would be too small to find. And when the playerbase finds it, it won't matter if we had 10000 players swear they tested and didn't see anything. People would still call the game broken and untested.
---
Worse if any of those test players stream their tests. So much footage and public knowledge of the 76 launch bugs were compilations of people playing the BETA and experiencing stuff fixed in the final game.
---
I'm sorry, but while this is a good idea. 
---
It just won't matter.
---
They had a BETA, and a Pre BETA. No test server is going to suddenly be taken seriously by players if they find bugs in the finished product. It didn't happen then, and people's views aren't nuanced enough to care about whatever different aspects there would be to private servers.
---
A tiny minority of people's stuff got deleted by the scrapbox. The rest just got a UI bug, but people acted like the whole thing was broken beyond belief to everyone.
---
Even if it was as stable as RDR2 online with wastelanders, it would only take a few glitches, no matter how rare for people to write the whole thing off.
---
Water Ways outside of Charleston is closest overall.
---
It's a bingo! Hunter's effect is almost useless, FFR doesn't work with one-shot weapons like a crossbow and +250 is bugged, it breaks the most other effects (like bloodied, vampire's, etc.). Not sure about hunter's.
---
Just throw that piece of shit into legendary shredder.
---
I have so much .45 I actually dumped half of it out of my vendor machine. 
---
If you're on PS4, I'll give you the rest for free.
---
Fair point
---
Ranger outfit
---
He can‚Äôt put in a ticket that is the problem
---
Hey private server and just sit at ammo factory for hours on end.
---
He can‚Äôt put in a ticket to the website and it is about atoms and how it is giving him issues in mmm not sure exactly what it is about.
---
lol, what an idiot.
---
For the record, you don't need to do anything with the turrets in Jail Break.  All that matters is that you kill what's typically a trickle of low-level Super Mutants.
---
Pretty sure NW kills and revives count towards this
---
The outfits change but my opposum hat mostly stays...
---
Set up CAMP on a lead deposit and auto mine it while you play.
---
Oh man the nostalgia of hearing it again
---
I've been running the forest camo, and fasnacht beret with the patrolmans sunglasses for 100+ levels.
---
The game is still broke as hell that's why lol
---
Support is your best bet. I have issues with the site to this day, but I still managed to submit 11 tickets. Just think of a workaround or something.
---
As of today- pilgrim outfit and hat.
---
What was your issue with it? Quick, before I have 30 downvotes and zero fucking explanations lol
---
Peasant. Without 50k 5mm and 50k .50cal, my heavy gunner doesn't go any where. :)
---
Yes:
---
In comparison to my first playthrough, the 400-&gt;800 change was like night and day... right up until I hit 800 (albeit later in the game), and fell into the same pit.
---
Scrap management is not a positive mechanic: and it highlights some pretty flawed and clunky control issues with using the inventory interface.
---
People hit that mark and sigh, before considering whether to slog through or log out - it's not simply a matter of looking at a spreadsheet/summary/graph of available materials and quickly dumping a couple of excess/unneeded scrap: you need to go through bit by bit and rummage: and it's just too far on the side of exhausting.
---
fallout 1st subscription required for bug fixes
---
I meant it as a joke, since amongst Doomsday preppers they're the, ahem, gold standard currency, ahem, for the end of the world. 
---
That is actually a smart idea. Especially since the scrap box.
---
I‚Äôll take it lol.
---
When we can learn to work and play...
---
I have no idea what you are talking about. What was fixed or not fixed?
---
My armor &amp; the FS Revolutionary helmet + welding goggles + camo bandana

You're welcome to add me dtb7591. I'll just pick your door, kill, and repeat.
---
I love the new display case.
---
was there anything meaningful to talk about?
---
No? Just opened up the game and was able to select character like normal. Someone else posted this earlier though (unless you posted twice?)
---
Your riot armor skins went from 500 atoms to free in 2 hours
---
1 - take Hemlock Holes maintenance, set up three acid extractors. 2 - hit up the Lucky Hole for lead.  3 - clear through the Big Bend Tunnel or mine out the iron deposits in the entrance tunnel of the Load Bearing event for steel. 4 - complete the Collision Course event for cloth. 5 - visit Toxic Larry's for the snallygasters and loot their stuff, collect the acid from the extractors.  6 - put on Super Duper and make some gunpowder and smelt some iron/lead. 7 - put on Ammosmith and hope that Super Duper triggers more than 1/3rd of the time as you fire out those .45s
---
I've found that the submachine gun does not benefit much from being primed and I much prefer using it with normal ammo. Also: if you put on a Scorched Killer's receiver the rate of fire goes up to almost the same as the LMG and it gains a surprising amount of DPS at the expense of ammo
---
The exit save is still the most broken thing for survival mode. Only works once or twice and never works again after because the game goes to the menu too quickly to save.
---

This is easily the highlight of r/fo/76 by a wide margin

It sucked and got very old,
---
Lemme guess, you were going for a "Frankenstein" look with that armor, weren't you?
---
Before I switched to mainly melee, I would run through Sutton, Helvetia, fairgrounds, the Forest basically using only melee while picking up all the ammo.  Not a long term solution, but effective enough.
---
Looks like the work of Robert House...

Tbh I‚Äôm short of any sense after having this happen over and over. Long story short. I can repeat a bug where if I buy atoms normally in the atomic shop going to the Xbox store, I do not get my atoms at all. But, when I click on an item I don‚Äôt have enough atoms for, it asks me to buy more, I click yes, buy the atoms thru the Xbox store, even hit back to go into the game and my atoms are immediately there. Been almost 2 weeks maybe more since I last made an atoms purchase and still hasn‚Äôt gone thru. I see no sign of a refund made into my bank account so I can only assume it‚Äôs still being sorted.
---
Sounds like their adding the game to the game
---
Did they hire 500 chimps to bang away on keyboards all day until they got a faint shadow of a game called FO76?  Logic need not apply when it comes to some of their decisions.
---
Get out of here with you or expectations! Bethesda is a small company and you cant mock them just because their games dont like turning on all the time!
---
Yeah.... That's what they say. But they fix other price bugs I'm less than 90 minutes and don't announce them. 
---
And it wasn't 2 hours, it was more like a full day.
---
Traveling leather coat and bottle cap sunglasses. I‚Äôm fly as fuck
---
Yes there is, post on the market sub like H:whatever sheepsquatch helmet or jac o lantern plan w: .45 ammo. I think .45 is probably worth less than a cap in bulk, so you know, try to get them for a half a cap equivalent.
---
The old one is much better. Also it sounds nicer.
---
copy man thanks! i shall see what what my post brings!
---
One follow up comment on this.   When you hit the mines wear Excavator armour.  You get 4x more ore as than you normally would.   
---
Also, farm Tangra town for the acid from the crickets.
---
I report anyone using racial slurs or any slurs of any sort honestly. Cussing is fine! Say whatever you want in the sense of profanity but when it turns to hate mongering I have0 tolerance for that shit! If you can‚Äôt function like an adult in public chat (while playing an adult game) then you deserve to have your communications banned.
---
Okay well the ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù of Bethesda is essentially a tyrannical dictatorship - they do what they want, without listening, and they don‚Äôt care about their ‚Äúpeople‚Äù so to speak. So this might not work! But any true American will vote nonetheless because well, freedom ya know! 
---
Can I vote for New Vegas 2?
---
I'm not sure about two shot, but if you check your pipboy after each shot on an enemy you can see ether damage increasing :)

Which armor set are you running in the video and what mods on it?

If on private server, after nuke is dropped log oit then back in. Enemies will spawn after area is reloaded.
---
Thank you
---
Can you still get it from enclave events? That‚Äôs how I got mine months ago. Not sure if it‚Äôs completely gone tho.
---
This is what I figured...not dropping and using a container. I just don't like relying on others with help for that...its not a trust thing. It's a self-reliance issue. Thank you for the quick response. I am going to try it with some garbage before I give it a go with important inventory.
---
Also, about how much of a window do you have to do the swapping? I had read about 5 minutes, which is more than enough time. Is that the case?
---
Had a similar issue with atoms that were bought not appearing in the atomic shop on Xbox. 
---
Submitted a trouble ticket and received a response back from their support team that I needed to provide screenshots from my Microsoft store account off of my computer proving my purchase of said atoms. 
---
I did as I was instructed and in their next response the support team told me to wait 72 hours for the atoms to appear. After 96 hours, I showed them screenshots of the atomic shop showing that my atoms did not go through and they finally forced it through on their end.
---
Even after all that, I'm still encountering this bug today.
---
I do not have Fallout First, but from what I've seen and read the servers have a timer (about 5 minutes), even for Fallout First members.  If you are transferring items, close the game entirely to desktop/dashboard, then log in as one character, place items into a world container, log in as second character and the items should be there.  This process is not 100% guaranteed, you are still taking a chance if you are transferring special items. A trusted friend is still the best process.
---
If you take the Ammosmith Perk card and the SuperDuper perk card, you can make a good deal of ammo for yourself. The materials are a whole other matter though; if you go with tin can chimes, you wind up with plenty of lead and steel - no acid required.
---
Just do dailies and weeklys and you can get hundreds of atoms from little effort.
---
Wastelanders will never drop
---
With full unyeilding and sneaky boy perks, I get detected all day long by super muties and all the mobs at the sbq. With some chameleon peices (not even a full set most of the time), I'm only detected if something literally runs into me.  This is on characters that have 11 and 15 agility, and all armor mods are for stealth (shrouded wood, shadowed, muffled, etc.).
---
Heavy Build with a Legacy Gatling Plasma is definitely going to be the best choice if you can source the weapon.  Insane damage (best gun damage in the game), and very inexpensive ammo cost in the grand scheme of things.  This is just a great all around build.  To me the one to find is a VE Plasma, but BE will do top damage. 
---
If that‚Äôs not an option, you can go rifleman or commando, but keep in mind you will be significantly weaker than a more traditional ballistic build.  A Legacy Laser Rifle is great if you can get one of those for the build, but keep in mind that this gun sucks in tight quarters.  I tried to make my Rifleman pure energy weapons, and after blowing myself up 80 times in West Tek with my BE Laser rifle.  I decided I was going to move a B25 Fixer into the mix to make it possible to survive these situations without exploding myself.
---
The Tesla is decent situationally (I like the arcing), but lacks range.  The Gauss pretty much sucks in my opinion, and I own two BE and TSE legacy versions that are pretty ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. 
---
I guess the moral of the story is this, if you want an energy build that‚Äôs doing good damage, I think sourcing a legacy or two is necessary.
---
And yet the game is enjoyed by millions many who say its there favorite game. Why on earth did this game get put at the top of the list as best game ever  of so many people when there are so many experts on reddit that do nothing but tell us how bad it is? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Of course, that all changed once they added the Ranger outfit. And a Gladiator outfit so it looks appropriate with the Centurion Helmet.

Find some bugs for bethesda and get banned for it. Sounds good

Genuinely torn, here. I like it moving more naturally, it just... physics... better. But I totally see in comparison pictures how much it hides detail.
---
Dunno wat du.
---
Stalker outfit, Ranger outfit, one of the many awesome Jumpsuits, and almost always I‚Äôm wearing a Fasnacht Beret.
---
Thank you for using paragraphs.
---
It really does seem like an intern has made a good chunk of the bug fixes. Particularly the model placement and collision issues.
---
There are small on the unofficial bug list with the actual fix spelled out and while those still remain, a few shrubs get repositioned a little better.
---
* I think so, not positive.
---
You know I wish I could say I didn‚Äôt warn Microsoft support this would happen and I‚Äôll follow up with them in the morning but literally after being told ‚Äúwait 24-72 hours‚Äù and my response was ‚ÄúI have waited already before‚Äù, I got an email saying ‚Äúthanks for contacting us, take the survey‚Äù and yeah..I‚Äôm guessing they closed my ticket within minutes unless that‚Äôs a normal thing to get a survey about how the experience is going minutes into it starting..
---
I'll tell you what needs to happen to the Atomic Shop. Seriously, this ain't some 'stop pushing microtransactions so hard' post, although yea, that'd be great. Limited items need to no longer be a thing. If I want the Vault-Tec Power Armor skin, for example, why do I need to wait for Bethesda to decide to put it back in the shop? Everything should be available always, with rotating sales on items. Simple concept.
---
If they haven't instituted a PTR by this point, they're never going to.
---
longshore outfit with either the ranger headwear or the sack hood
---
Do it safely by moving one piece at a time by placing them into a container in private servers then logging out then go right back in on the new character. If you have a lot of weapons to move, then move one or two at a time. Its tedious, but don't worry because it's better to lose one item vs all of your items.
---
I constantly farmed lead and steel to make the amount of ammo I have now.  A grins but so worth being able to use my favorite guns, lol
---
Question, do you have an onboard GPU or a second GPU installed?
---
Glad they fixed the login bug.  At least one of their fixed items was affecting me.
---
I nean... I had a problem with how plastic the bottom of it seemed, so stiff and shitty...
---
But I've seen the comparison images that show how much detail on the jeans and shit you see less of now, and I gotta say I'm torn.
---
I think I'd prefer an option to choose from both versions at will.
---
I suppose you can just wait and see, since you'll see the value in either outcome. :)
---
will do.
---
nope.
---
You say you use Cheat Engine professionally, so please explain why you weren't expecting, if you follow very specific changes to the run-time memory, to find a way to exploit the game? You really can't defend this as "just testing it for Bethesda" as it's common sense that if you change the client enough you'll contravene the intended workings of the client.
---
As you know not to attach the debugger, it seems that you knew exactly what you were doing. As you're banned, it also seems that your experiments didn't stop at just scanning the memory.
---
Good question.   The atom store doesn't specify.  Works on excavator, all systems nominal.
---
You can still buy it from the production terminals when they spawn. It's like 1 in 100,000,000 chance.  
---
Someone got the forest scout mask for 98 caps the other day.
---
I was green with jealous rage
---
I'd stay away from the overseers stash as it may reload with only the intended original items.  I've used the empty suitcase in front of pleasant valley station with no issues.  Also used a locker that had items in it at sutton station, I looted it first though.  I'd look for an empty container to be safe, although I suppose all containers could spawn loot.

---
Honestly, I think the best option is having a NV and 76 version both be craftable. Cuz while you're right, I see the value in both... I equally see the drawbacks in both, so allowing players to choose their aesthetic with it seems best for everybody.
---
I would assume such a solution wouldn't be hard to implement... but... well... *gestures at the whole game and... everything*.

The store has no defects we should be grateful haaha naah!

This would be the kind of good fix that would get me some goodwill to overlook a lot of problems.
---
Risking of asking something stupid, but...
---
... why do you need so much acid?
---
I want Bethesda to fix this so I dont mind whatsoever
---
I check back here every few weeks to see if the damage bug is fixed yet, I would be able to handle all the other bugs and bullshit in this game if my legendary weapons from december 2018 would actually work
---
Oh I can kill quite a few before I‚Äôm seen with no silencer needed, unyielding armour helps with that (no points in stealth needed lol).  But I prefer just waltzing up to them and shooting anything that moves in the head.  I‚Äôm trying to not be stealthy with this character.
---
I thought about a 10mm as a backup but prefer the black powder pistol for taking down tough enemies.  (Build critical with 2-3 shots of six shooter, switch to black powder and shoot whatever it is in the head).
---
If anything, id prefer another bloodied six shooter over a 10mm.  I‚Äôm still tweaking my character to find the right combination of perks, armour mods and god tier unyielding armour lol.  (I‚Äôve got three pieces but two are one star).
---
I am now immune to scorch beasts sonic attacks though, so that‚Äôs good.  (Dense plus 1 rank in fireproof).
---
If I hadn't read the patch notes, I wouldn't have noticed a difference.
---
I agree
---
I never said it was bad...I love it...doesn't negate that they didn't fix known bugs for years yet keep releasing new versions...

Not sure if "glitch" is the right word, but explosive energy weapons were never actually fixed. Their simple fix was to remove them from the drop pool and tell us they will eventually be reimplemented when they are adjusted. It's been 10 or 11 months and no mention on when that will happen. In their current state, if you have an explosive energy weapon that can have a splitter mod, it deals a ridiculous amount of damage. It completely ignored the pvp damage caps when pvp was pretending to not be dead in this game, and in pve it makes even the ridiculously tanky end-game bosses a joke. For reference, I don't even have a bloodied or adrenal build and I soloed the ISS with my explosive nocturnal gatling plasma. Took like 30-40 seconds of direct fire to drain both health bars
---
You done REEEEING yet? The game has had nothing added to it in months, everyone is bored now. Do you not realize you can mute people who hurt your fragile feelings?

It was ok for the first few weeks when NW came out but got old real quick.

I'll tell you what needs to happen to the Atomic Shop. Seriously, this ain't some 'stop pushing microtransactions so hard' post, although yea, that'd be great.

Everything should be available always, with rotating sales and bundles. Simple concept.
---
This exact same thing happened to me yesterday
---
In my opinion it's a great support / tank build. Sure it's not bloodied or junkies which is most people's go to set up but it's still a fun playstyle , again just my thoughts on it, got over 1000 hours with nothing but shotguns and never felt like I was outmatched, cripple, heal (with a support crit build) and kill when possible.
---
2 shot is not 100% 100% per shot its 50% 52%
---
It's an odd change. I don't think anyone asked for it and seems like it's just busy work for the sake of showing that you've done something.
---
This guy gets it
---
Or the dying and only place you and res-wan is at the vault, like seriously ...
---
It's not even the new normal. It's been this way since launch. Bethesda's priorities are all out of whack.
---
what other unique named weapons with a special perk are out there like the fixer
---
Aw so ugly now :(
---
It just works
---
If you have fallout 1st and just loot literally everything. Kill robots,launch nukes, pick up weights, keep looting, do the vault raids halfway through to get the bulk ammo supply. It took me 4 days to go from 0 scrap to nearly 1k in everything after I lost it initially and had a buddy help me out with killing an looting cause he also picked everything up an gave me his scrap. Like I'm sitting at 1.1k lead again and 9k steel because of fallout 1st.
---
Someone mentioned this a while back and the community managers responded about liking the idea. Not sure when this will happen though
---
While that is true, I would just like to point out: they fixed the prime combat rifle receivers using ultracite .44 instead of ultracite .45 only last update. It took them around 11 months from the time it was reported and became a commonly known issue to fix that. And there is absolutely no way that is anything other than the very bottom of the barrel low hanging fruit of a fix. I filmed myself fixing an example of something similar in the fallout 4 geck within 3 minutes with zero prior knowledge (I scrolled through the lists until I found what I was looking for, had to copy/paste the IDs for .308 ammo and .45 ammo) and then sent that video to them along with a post I made here with over a hundred weapon-related bugs, many of which were seemingly just typos in the files. This was at some point over the summer. Guess how many of those are fixed today?
---
TL:DR even a &lt;5 minute fix that could be done by an intern takes them close to a year to fix, the amount of work needed to fix something honestly has no correlation to how long it takes them at this point
---
Lol I‚Äôve had one do it at a horde but nothing like this!
---
Wait...you actually think that the mods of this subreddit work for Bethesda?
---
As someone who uses melee weapons 90% of the time since day one, it can be easy to get thousands upon thousands of ammo types.  I dont craft any but just instinctively pick them up.
---
The problem with that is that eventually, the atomic shop will be overloaded with too many purchasable items. That will do two things, one: make fallout 76 look even worse down the road when people start complaining that there are over like a thousand different pieces of microtransactions, and two, it will make things a ton more difficult to find. Want a simple weapon skin you've been saving for? Have a fun time digging through the atomic shop finding stuff. It just doesnt make much sense to do it that way.
---
Wonder if it's a bug it just happened to my friends as well just a few minutes ago even spawned in robots that were just there no health bar and not dead very weird ü§î
---
Imposter
---
Did you get them yet?
---
When I tested weightless chameleon mutation agi 19 vs. Unyielding agi 34 both with 3* sneak and EA they seems to be about the same for detection. But, enemies seemed to wander off more with chameleon.

Do you have PayPal on your phone? Any purchases I make on Xbox goes thru PayPal and I get a notification on my phone that I paid Microsoft a whatever amount.

üëçYup, just another regular day
---
I've got you PSN Skizzunky
---
If they ever do release player test servers I'm willing to bet it will only be for Fallout 1st subscribers.  It would be just like current day Bethesda to make people pay for the privilege of bug testing their game.
---

---
Good thing you mentioned 14 bucks is nothing to you and have already spent hundreds of dollars on atoms.
---
I am genuinely curious how everything played out. Did you ever get your alternate unbanned and refund?
---
Well apparently 1.4 million copies of FO76 were sold by the end of 2018
---
So i do more damage than 134 a shot? How would that work
---
What's your source?
---
A bloodied assaultron blade is the best sword type in the game imo.
---
Now you'll see a bunch if people arrive and tell you that none of these problems occur and that you're making them up, and then downvote this post to hell.
---
2s got buffed so its only 3% more dmg for 1 of the 2 shots thats all i can say about it
---
Not sure the breakdown in hours but if it helps, I calculated nocturnal stuff is good for about 7 mins
---
Just set a stopwatch to your pip-boy for 1 minute, multiply by 60
---
&gt;Multiple pieces of chameleon stack to make you slightly less visible. A full set of chameleon gives you about the same visibility as the chameleon mutation or a stealthboy. The power armor stealth mod is significantly less effective than all other forms of visual stealth field.
---
Seems like a visibility test would be easy to do to confirm or debunk this.
---
This is what happens when the priorities of the developers lie in sucking as much money as possible out of the playerbase.
---
That sounds like the perfect game crashing event my man.
---
Sorry my mind is rusty... I have been changing my build up lately and had some things mixed up.
---
I just double checked in game and my carry capacity is base of 275, or 305 with armored pack (30 pounds) or 395 with high capacity pack (120 pounds! not 60 as I had remembered). I do most of my travels with the armored or rad resist packs and only use the high cap to fast travel home.
---
I'm at 17 STR in the pipboy.  5 base STR, -1STR Bird Bones, -1STR Eagle Eyes, Radicool (5STR), 3 pieces unyielding armor (forgot I swapped in a weightless sentinel piece AND a chameleon piece) for 9STR.
---
If I did two more unyielding pieces I could add another 20 carry weight but IMO it's not worth it.
---
In excavator armor I'm at 430 carry weight. STR is at 16 in the pipboy. 5 base STR, +6STR "Power Armor" (I guess +4 from the chassis and +2 from motion assist servo torso?), 5STR radicool. Two legs with calibrated shocks for +50 each and "excavator set" bonus of +100. So that's base carry weight of 150+80+50+50+100=430.
---
With the excavator weight bug (log out wearing it and log back in) it's  560 carry weight... somehow. Wow TBH I never actually looked at this and I'm pretty surprised it's that high. I guess it doubles any bonuses from power armor mods? You can stack food buffs on top of that and get above 600 pounds pretty easily I bet.
---
I'm not sure about a cap on special stats. I think some do but I think it's different for them all.
---
Should be 3 minutes.
---
Why should we pay for private servers? I've played many, many games where one host a game on their PC and others join on your game, how is that different from a "private server"?
---
If wastelanders aren't I really hope there is another class action.
---
States as part of Clause 1.  Access to your Private World, Survival Tent, exclusive in-game Atomic Shop promotions and sales.
---
So far we‚Äôve had one set of free skins for the Ranger Armor. 
---
That would fit the bill for the first part. Exclusive promotions, but one single promotion this month when the shop updates weekly is a bit of a stretch and definitely is not fitting the promotions aspect of the clause.
---
As for sales part... That has definitely come up empty ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
How much do you expect the one person working on all the websites to do?
---
Try making a little town, I like mine a lot. Nice little shop, maybe a bar or lounge and a bunk house. I do mine in a circle kind of with fences or now I use hay bales to fill in around the buildings.
---
Egh, anything nocturnal is bleh. It's for a camp build. Still interesting to know though.
---
&gt; Multiple pieces of chameleon stack to make you slightly less visible.  
---
Definitely consistent with my experience.  I've spent a long time switching chameleon / unyielding pieces to find the right balance of stealth and SPECIAL bonuses.   I find 3 pieces of chameleon gives me the enough stealth.
---
Thanks man.
---
Wow! That's a lot even without exploiting the bug. Will check my equipment I guess.
---
He already busy getting coffee for everyone.
---
Likewise, I've spend dozens of hours experimenting with chameleon/NPC and I do not believe the conclusion that it has no impact on NPCs.  It would be very long odds for that to be true and for me to just be the best sneaker in the game..
---
Is it something like this? Just reminded me of having seen the post lol
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dql7sc/final_update_damaged_mouth/
---
I literally googled "fallout 76 sales"
---
If that's the case why was survival a ghost town before they shut it down?
---
Survival was good for having a server with less lag, because they were empty. People did fault raids on survival servers just for that reason.
---
Does it actually register all the photos and allow you to get the reward, unlike last week's "set the world on fire" one where (for me at least) it wouldn't register getting a launch code?
---
Your source is uncited info from Wikipedia. Lol. Might as well have said "I made them up".
---
Unless you‚Äôre enjoying them.
---
I only saw one. At this point I don‚Äôt even mind. I‚Äôve seen worse in game
---
PRAISE THE SUN! PRAISE IT!
---
Get fucking RID of Fallout 1st, you greedy assholes!!
---
I hate Bethesda just as much as the next guy, specially after the whole fallout 1st BS, they said all updates will be free. That was a deciding factor in getting the game for me. You are correct Zenimax/Bethesda deserves it.
---
But fallout 76 is not bethesda. 
---
I should've clarified  I was referring to the people hating the game because a youtuber told them to.  I played since launch, when the hate bandwagon people listed all the same issues. I told them what my experience was and asked what theirs was. Usually they never played and just regurgitated some youtuber.
---
ok then, there was a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/aba3cz/a_look_at_fallout_76s_sales_figures/) a while back that tried to sum them up too which put the numbers at around 1.6 million at the time
---
Trying it out made me notice misalignment in my walls, which I then traced to misalignment in the floors, so snapping might be broken in the game?  Is that a known thing?  I would be an apologist and mention rounding errors but the coordinate system is out to like 4 or 5 decimal places given what they looked like in the console in F4, and a tiny mistake that small wouldn't be obvious to the eye once you look for it.
---
That's one OCD thing about me, overlapping/spazzing textures from misalignments or layering issues.
---
Still not a verified source, because that is also based on speculation and number crunching. 
---
Not to mention we haven't taken into account the huge number of refunds and the large number of people who have stopped playing long ago.
---
I think your character is going to be saved once you leave the vault and your appearance can be changed at any point in the game BUT about latter, I am not 100% sure.
---
Lucky.
---
Many wouldn't have paid the money if the scrapbox was given to everybody for free. It is the same thing as if Fallout 76 went f2p on release and everyone who preordered that was offered no refund or compensation. They would have all their rights to be pissed AF.
---
It's a salty ocean, indeed
---
I want to like the game so bad
---
...and fixing floating shrubs
---
I always found the bug kinda entertaining.  Like sometimes I jump normally and sometimes I'm a spaceman
---
Im not saying current player numbers, im saying total sales, current player numbers i would put closer to what you said yeah
---
PRAISE TODD!
---
You have to subtract refunds from that.
---
What did they change on it?
---
Maybe because survival was a great idea, but poorly executed. The cap rewards, aid drops, it just didnt work. I see pvpers every night on here. Saying that there isn't many is just a flat lie. I pve and pvp. It gets annoying when one side is blind to the other. Not saying you, just speaking in general.
---
Or dying at the end of an event and having nowhere to respawn
---
Can you really say after 800 hours the pve we have is enough? If it is then great on you lol. I need to both enjoy the game in its current state.
---
This is correct I got my 20 player kills in nw
---
I‚Äôve stuck the suitcases at Whitesprings myself

Nevermind the run and run. How about a raid that's just about killing, not this unlimited spawn bullshit. I'm fine with the puzzles (maybe not the timers, due to lag), I just hate that there are ALWAYS enemies with their acid or poison or radiation...ugh.
---
I had a character in whiteface once (body black, head black, face white), it was unnerving.  Had to put on a costume, as I was on a high spawning server (events were like triple the normal spawns) and didn‚Äôt want to leave.
---
I saw someone running around in that shit during the mischief night event.
---
Honestly I don't care much about the main menu.  It's a weird thing to put  in the patch notes, IMO.   I don't recall anyone asking for it. Or maybe they did and I just missed it?
---
Yes, this challenge works, and last week's "set the world on fire" was also completable, you just had to complete different objectives besides collecting silo code pieces, the easiest 3 were taking a photo at a fissure site, killing a Scorchbeast and killing 10 enemies with a flamer.
---
OMG, I never thought about using stacked half walls with differing wallpapers....game changer, thank you!!!
---
Had that happen a long time ago instead of monster mash, and ended up killing until all my sniper‚Äôs weapons broke (I now carry 3 weapons of diff ammo types).  Wish I could force it because it was nuts.
---
My theory was I must have loaded in right as it was ending and bugged out the event to where it wouldn‚Äôt stop.
---
The quest starts at lvl 25, the same level required for wearing it :P
---
That was my thought as well. "An action-adventure exploration RPG with \*free\* wallpaper?
---
Be still my beating heart!
---
Snapshts and uusing
---
To be clear, have all your characters in same spot with a stash box, ideally a train station.
---
I‚Äôll be honest swapping like this on public servers really extended the life of the game to me, as nothing good went to waste.  This is probably my most used private server ‚Äúperk‚Äù.
---
Shut up and take my atoms!
---
Yes. I. joined 1st for private servers, that's it. The rest of the perks should be open to everyone and the ranger outfit should be sold to everyone.
---
Thank you to all that responded. I have a plan now. I just need to make a list of what goes and what I'm transfering. I am currently at about 900 lbs, so it'll probably be most of it. Thanks again everyone...upvotes for all.
---
Always wondered what muppet coded the GUI in the fallout games :/
---
No. Not the op you were asking about but there‚Äôs almost 0% chance I would pay for fallout first without the scrap box. I can buy atoms when I want to buy something. Private worlds are cool but unnecessary.
---
Yes, it should have been from the start (but i doubt it ever will be).
---
I vehemently disagree. The game doesn‚Äôt need a jumpstart. I think it would be better for everyone to just all cut our losses and make a fallout 5 with whatever wastelanders is planning to be in a new location. It‚Äôs just sad that we are *asking* to have BETA material...
---
Because I own it and don't want to get my wallet pinched by Bethesda and their swarm of shills like you?
---
It's not healthy sucking Todd Howard off all the time too.
---
I played since launch and had 3, yes only 3 PVP encounters, 2 were at the very beginning. 
---
We stuck it out with the game despite the bugs, lies and poorly executed updates and fixes. If survival mode PVP was in such a demand why didn't players stuck it out as well? 
---
FYI. I agree survival is a good idee, it keeps the PVP players from PVE players. My 3de pvp encounter was just after survival got dropped.
---
This, dot bother with hemlock work shop, just sever hop over and over killing the crickets at tangara town, youll get around 40-60 acid per hop this way not taking more that 3 minutes each if you are fast enough.
---
Please use power armor as you may fall a couple time trying to get up.
---
Serious.  Wouldnt wish that on almost anyone
---
I used a keycard the moment  it reset, was so disappointed. Nukacrypt hasn‚Äôt updated yet so I doubt it‚Äôs known
---
That Bullshit. If they delivered a good game, the would have enough money from the cosmetic MTX. Besides we don't even know. Maybe they already covered the cost of there skeleton Crew in Austin. I just was not enough revenue for the management. These companys are greedy...
---
So you‚Äôd rather post it on here where they might never see it instead of making a report so they can fix it?
---
I was glad to get the Vault Boy "Have A Day" icon. It kinda sums me up, but i wouldn't spend atoms on them every 5 minutes, no.
---
Yes it only affect teamates, not you. Hence why you need two persons. Even if you are 4, only two need to equip it. If one persons share rad sponge then it will work on him too.
---
I would absolutely love to! You can come on by and check out my base, and we can figure out what sorta style you're looking for, and then make somethin awesome. 
---
Not something I've ever done, and I'm far from an amazing builder. But I'd love to give it a go and see what we can make! Lemme know man. Gt: apneac
---
Doing great work as always bud :)
---
Don't try to be logical on this sub, it's only going to get you downvoted.
---
100% Someone gave me a good suggestion to make a little town so I think I‚Äôm going to go with that
---
Yes, but there is no lag if you pay 100 dollars a year. The makes sense....
---
Can anyone say for sure what cloaking armor‚Äôs effect is specifically?
---
I added you
---
I like it for some reason, and hate it for other. Personally I always put mine behind (and as close to touching) my stash box, so it suits me really well! But most people have it stand alone in very nice shiny areas. So I think its gonna screw over most peoples nice lil designs. Would be cool to have both. A new and worn version
---
Every Fallout before has unlimited inventory space. This is not a game mechanic. It is the stupidity of Bethesda...
---
I dig it! I'd be concerned about camp budget, but it could absolutely work! I've got myself a little cafe and I'm very proud of it
---
i might consider reinstalling  the game if half my time wasn't spent on just organizing my inventory space
---
Eh? Modus defended himself when attacked by the enclave, which killed them off. then it went dormant until vault 76 opened and made friends with the vault dweller. Who sided with modus?
---
They're tiny compared to the silo nukes though. Maybe like a smaller temporarily irradiated area, they've got a decent blast radius
---
It‚Äôs great that you enjoy using it. You can certainly build around Bloodied or Junkies shotguns. The weapon i used most was a BE pump. But after the nerf it‚Äôs just not efficient. Sure i can still use it to kill stuff, but with other weapons i need less ammo and material farming.
---
I preferred the original - why do they need to be the same colour?
---
Thank you. There is indeed some strange values they changed from FO4.
---
That‚Äôs very true! I have several good handmades but I don‚Äôt use them just because everyone and their moms are wielding handmades lol. Shotguns are very badass, that‚Äôs why I felt terrible when Bethesda nerfed them.
---
Gotta be honest.. not liking what I've made so far. Gonna keep fiddlin with it and see if I can't make this any better tho
---
That‚Äôs alright
---
&gt;It‚Äôs not the developers fault.
---
I would like to think that is the case but previously fixed bugs returning after a patch or so later isn't a management issue. It very much falls squarely onto the developers themselves.
---
However, that's an aside thing. The issue is about how messed up their priorities seem to be. 
---
I get some seemingly simple problems could be more complex to actually solve but I can fathom for a moment that say something as relatively straightforward as the daily challenge auto-complete bug that's been around since June couldn't be fixed by now, let alone in the past month since the last patch.
---
I would have preferred one of two of these types of bugs being fixed than all the trivial and inconsequential things they fixed in this patch round.
---
Turns out Nukacrypt's code from the 19th worked into the 20th. (1am East coast time). Thanks Again Nukacrypt!
---
Or not being able to finish challenges because wild wasteland isn't available anymore...

---
So 6 months of testing isn‚Äôt enough for them to release the maps?
---
It should have been part of the base game and yes everyone should have it. That said, it ain't gonna happen.  It was the main reason I bought the service for a whole year.  I think that's the story with a lot of people.  If it wasn't behind a paywall then Bethesda would not be making near as much money. Sad but true.
---
BE massively outperforms BFFR because explosive on legacy weapons gives more explosive damage than it normally would. That's why they got removed.
---
Its a grey wallpaper with some lighter shade stripes. Nice looking, simple.
---
I am sure 6 months testing would be plenty. But it hasn't been out 6 months and 2 of those maps have exactly 0 seconds of testing. They were still patching exploits on the current map in the latest patch.
---
God damn, that is some damage. Thanks for the explanation.
---
Wow that's garbage.
---
Or items that are strangely absent from the game despite being shown in promotional media (wodden armor mask, .44 bull barrel, marine armor helmet only on PC).
---
Hmm what platform are you playing on? Ps4, 300+ kills, always a drop
---
The waiting on nw etc. I mean sure, sometimes it happens, but not enough to say it's often.
---
It's not all bad. I pvp often. I also build for new players give weapons etc. We make the game a good one.
---
Oh huh that‚Äôs interesting, maybe it‚Äôs just the same code? Cause they were definitely changed by then, or it‚Äôs just some bug lol.I should‚Äôve tried I guess

---
If you want to see enemy ER just equip the perception card "awareness" and look at the resistance you see. The number you see will be the number after your armor penetration effects so you can equip "stabilized" and see different resistance numbers. Armor penetration is calculated before the damage VS armor calculation. The armor number you see in awareness is the most your damage could be reduced per shot but some of that number will be ignored as your damage per shot goes up. When damage and armor are roughly equal, the final damage is reduced by 50%
---
I've made it my mission to give new players PA frames. Surprised how many new players there is, according to the media no one plays it lol.

All stash box items are shared space, so it will not give you extra space, just an extra box to access your stash.

Such a fucking lazy reskin
---
From my testing these two things, the visibility hiding and the sneak skill, affects two different things with the NPCs ability to detect you. Remember the old "bucket on the head" trick in skyrim? You put a bucket over a NPCs head and suddenly you could steal stuff because they could no longer see you. Remember, this is the same engine...
---
The NPC has two ways of detecting you:  
---
\- being inside their visual cone  
---
\- being close enough for their Perception to notice you (ie, hearing/noticing your presence)
---
Reducing your visual footprint lessens the chance of them seeing your with their actual sight. Chameleon, cloaking, escape artist, stealthboys etc, etc. It is the F76 equivalent of putting a bucket on their head.
---
The Stealth Skill and everything that gives it bonuses (Agility, Better sneak legendaries, Stealth perks, stealthboy bonus etc etc) instead works against the enemies Perception skill. Notice that if you counter their  perception well enough you can be in their line of sight and still be undetected, the cone of sight still seems to be Perception related or reduced in size by this skill as well.
---
So, a health combination of both is most useful, even though the skill itself is what matters most.
---
Now this is very anecdotal evidence, but it is built up from 1200+ hours of sneaking around in this game and an ungodly amount of sneaking in this same game engine in other games.
---
Nerf them into the ground. What's the downside? People gonna come cry on reddit that they can't Tesla stealth boy spam? Everyone will laugh. The pve uses of a stealth boy are very limited, they are almost exclusively a pvp item.
---
If you have the option to paint it, do. Painted items don't show up as options in the scrip machine.
---
I still can't complete that challenge to kill big enemies because the game says I have yet to kill a SBQ even though I'm currently carrying almost 80 improved repair kits on me...
---
So there is really no way to increase storage space? Is there a way to store power armor in like a power armor stand without it despawning? I have alot of power armor chasis and armor pieces that take up alot of storage. But I tried to place them before but when I logged back in they despawned.
---
Vampire or Junkies. AA can be good as well, though not as much
---
Content won‚Äôt cure retardation
---
NW will atrophy and die of neglect just like survival mode. Survival needed balance changes and never got anything besides a damage cap bandaid before it got shut down. NW will suffer the same fate without constant balance changes.
---
Beta isn't an acronym though, just Greek alphabet
---
Best thing of the patch. Sad but true.
---
So if I‚Äôm reading this right
---
- harder to detect legendary with a stack of 5 is the same as the sneak perk card. But not the move detect part which would be half of the perk card.
---
- the fixer perk only effects move speed while sneaking and not detection?
---
Do you know how Escape Artist interacts with Power Armor and/or PA stealth mod? I assume that PA makes more noise so it's easier to detect, but I was wondering if a build using X-01 with the stealth boy mod, Sneak 3, Escape Artist and a decent amount of Agility would be able to be as stealthy as a non-PA user.
---
Bulk selling too, I don‚Äôt want to sell ammo 1 cap per round but right now i have no choice.
---
When you server hop you see it a lot for sure on Xbox since it‚Äôs slow loading in.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 you can join me in the next 10 minutes for the cricket challenge
---
Put all the PA pieces onto chassis
---
Dont care either way, now that I can finally mute the music.
---
The other half of the Tesla spam problem is people chugging quantums while in a stealth boy. The healing effect stacks - unlike with stimpacks - so people with the resources can quantum every 3 seconds to remain almost immortal unless they take very direct heavy damage. Nerf stealth boys and quantums and fix teslas.
---
How is +250 DR is broken specifically?   
---
I have a gun with that legendary, i can see the DR raise in pip-boy while reloading (+250 DR while reloading), and i think it works too.
---
I say I think it works because sometimes i get obliterated by some enemies, while in X01, where i destroyed every damn ghoul when i was lvl 20 with random crap armor. Capitol building specifically... Makes me think whether some enemies have dynamic difficulty.
---
I know right lol. I see new people every day. I know you're against pvp, but if you would ever like to see how to do it the right way lmk. Happy to help.
---
First level boosts explosive damage by 20%, the others by 10% each. On a ballistic weapon, the explosive damage is extra 20%... So yea, that's +4/2/2/2/2 extra of base weapon damage for a total of 12%. On a legacy energy weapon, the explosion does extra 100%... So that's +10/5/5/5/5... For a total boost of 30%.
---
Up to you to decide if it's worth it. For me a 30% damage boost is a great upgrade.
---
Handmade is the most versatile by far. Fixer is very similar. The lever is IMHO mostly a sniper. Others will disagree I‚Äôm sure.
---
By the dead junkie in Flatwoods. There are chems and weapons on the body and around it, lead at the hotel, and plenty of scrap material.
---
Discord VC: "Hey guys I found a legendary on me!"  
---
Me: "How many stars?"  
---
Other player: "1, it's a Legendary Noxious Sheepsquatch"  
---
Me: "Naw, waste of time."  
---
I and many others already ignore going out of our way for 1 star legendaries. 1 star items aren't very valuable to sell and their scrip-to-weight ratio is too low. Once you are covered in 2 and 3 star items, you only want 3 stars to optimize your build. Keep in mind there is some 1 in 50,000,000 chance or something crazy low you get a 3 star rolled exactly as you want for an item you are after (no wonder people dupe so much).
---
Bethesda has a few different ways of improving this, whether that means something as straightforward as removing legendary stars on enemies and having higher star items drop from higher level enemies, to something as drastic as removing legendary item drops in favor of legendary mod drops (e.g. you get a legendary Bloodied combat rifle mod that you attach to your Fixer).
---
Regardless of what can or should be done, if anything will be done, the fact remains that investing the amount of resources, time, and effort required for Encryptid, Project Paradise, and Death From Above + Scorched Earth should require substantially better rewards than what are available today. Similarly, given the focus on the loot grind as our primary/only endgame activity, it's absolutely frustrating that power progression completely halts without multiple stars lining up in your favor; this leads to the economy being a complete bust as people end up hoarding godrolls, possibly duping them in the process, and trade values skyrocket for said items while every other item is relatively valueless. You can't progressively increase your character's power in a reliable fashion, and you can't buy into it because of the wealth divide created between the have and the have-nots.
---
The Tesla rifle is one of my favorite weapons in this game. I have put all of my Tesla rifles into my stash months ago, collecting dust, because the damage bug renders my time absolutely wasted.
---
You are a sad little person who needs a nap.
---
Thanks for the tip. But I can't put power armor in power armor stands? Or will they despawn in power armor stands
---
No they will just go back into your inventory after 60 seconds
---
Bethesda could probably fix this easily, by using the Devs that helped upgrade and make the engine what it is. A small studio bought up by Bethesda and put to make a multiplayer game in a singleplayer engine, which is also an engine they never worked in before would probably struggle, since they don't know the engine and the related code. Which is what we see here.

I‚Äôm a pretty dedicated sniper fan.  I‚Äôve been playing variations on the same style since Fallout 3 (also elder scrolls titles, since they‚Äôre vaguely similar). I have three different stealth characters right now, and one power armor heavy gunner just for when I‚Äôm in the mood to be as loud as possible.  I started a rifleman on beta hour one, and added in an unarmed ninja build and commando later on.
---
All of my builds are min/max, because that‚Äôs how my brain works.  I‚Äôve tried just about every variant and combo of armor available.  Everything below is gleaned through actual game experience, methodically testing what works and weighing the benefits.
---
From my experience, a full suit of uny/ag/sneak armor is as good as it gets for PvE.  Yes, it‚Äôs a bummer those effects are expensive and valuable, but it‚Äôs because they work.  Aside from the sneak and covert operative perks, I find that boosting agility as high as possible provides the highest return toward staying in broad caution while in a fight.  There‚Äôs a noticeable difference between 30 and 40, and even more between 20 and 30.  When you have an agility at or around 40 with a full uny/sneak suit, enemies will sometimes push you aside when you‚Äôre in caution and you can walk right next to most enemies without alerting them.  I carry a couple stealth boys, but only use them against other players. If I want to avoid fighting or stay hidden, it‚Äôs generally not a problem.
---
Because poison damage is so strong, I personally wear two uny/poison/sneak pieces.  The other three have ag as the second effect.  It‚Äôs a matter of overall utility, and it does seem to be a system of diminishing returns as you stack more effects. Playing bloody, poison is really dangerous without some resistance.
---
Weightless and ultralight pieces do help, but the benefit seems to be equal to adding one agility point per piece/modification. I have no datamined evidence, just what I think through actually playing the game.
---
Chameleon is strange.  It does seem to stack, and does make a difference in PvE, but only against certain enemies.  Scorchbeasts and most animals seem to have no trouble finding you, but it will make you nearly undetectable to ghouls and super mutants.  Again, this is my experience in the game.
---
No matter how good your armor is, burrowing creatures will detect you almost immediately. If you‚Äôre at very long sniping range and pick them off from distance, you‚Äôll get caution.  Anywhere closer than 100 feet and you almost immediately go to danger.
---
I use all shadowed mods, one ultralight arm, one stabilized arm, one sleek leg and one muffled leg, as well as a dense torso because of explosive ammo and general utility.  Stabilized is like a permanent breath hold, and the bonus movement speed from sleek allows you to angle out of dangerous positions and get to new ones quicker.  Shadowed mods don‚Äôt seem to help during daylight, but for all intents and purposes they make you invisible at night and inside most buildings.
---
The Harder To Detect tertiary effect most certainly stacks, albeit with diminishing returns like everything besides the raw agility score.  One piece helps considerably, 
---
Sleek armor does stack with the Fixer‚Äôs movement bonus, but two pieces don‚Äôt stack with each other.  It‚Äôs just shy of normal jogging speed.  The stealth bonus of the gun does appear to stack like a sixth armor piece.
---
Outside issue with it's mag size, "The Fixer"
---
Then Probably Handmade
---
Hi, I'm a member of the group who did the datamining AMA, and I believe I can answer that.
---
Here's the full record for [ChameleonEffectArmorMod "Stealth Field" [MGEF:000976E0]](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/000976E0). 
---
It's the only effect listed in the [Chameleon legendary record](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/001F4D16) (not counting the audio effect).  
---
It's just an Image Space Modifier (IMOD), which is basically a visual rendering filter.  The associated script is also called "SpellEffectImodPlayerOnly"
---
If every piece of your Chameleon set has HTD, then that would certainly be why you're seeing a difference between using 1 and 5.
---
:/ well thanks for the help. That stash limit is pretty annoying
---
Vampire for "Defensive", as it will keep your Health topped up
---
Junkies for "offensive" as it will do more damage and is a "full health" build
---
Try it on a character with 1 Agility and no other Sneak boosts (Perk cards, Unyielding Armor, Legendary Agility Boosts). See how invisible you are to a Level 91 Deathclaw.
---
Trust me half the stuff you have in there you don‚Äôt need, you‚Äôll get used to it over time, we all did.
---
When we get new content, I'll jump back into the game and give you a shout.
---
Maybe, I'll check for stuff I don't need. The big problem I have right now is that I have armor and weapons of level 50 that I cannot use yet but I want to keep
---
Love it.
---
Fixing bugs, lol. You encounter a bug the very first moment you launch the game. It restricts movement of the cursor, which if you're tabbed out is a bit of an issue.
---
They will fix them, for 15 dollars per month extra. You can't expect them to fix bugs for free, right? lol Bethesda 2019.
---
Which exploit are you refering to? 10 - 15 seconds is like a week.
---
The last event I attempted to smash it out as often as posdible, unlike previous events this one blue screened or locked up 50% of the time. Unless big changes happen Wastelanders will be constant locking up and bluescreening given the number of players and now NPCs on each server !
---
No, the current one just explodes like a mini-nuke.
---
Imagine it at 400lbs. That's how it was in the beginning. Trust me you'll learn how to stop hoarding or you'll learn to live in P.A. Either way, here's to learning.

---
thanks guys!! tis my mission tomorrow!!!!
---
You should keep only Legendary weapons / armour
---
Everything else you can find / craft if you need it
---
tbh I've never had it work.
---
I guess I got some inventory management to do. I do get why there is a limit but if you for example want all power armors on display you should be able to do that without taking up stash space.
---
feel like parting with any  .45?? lol
---
Uncanny has a guarantee cricket spawn, so if you cant find some there by server hopping, at least once or twice, I'll say you're not trying. They spawn there 100% of the time, along with with a few mole miners. And even if someone has killed them, they'll respawn for you when you join the server.
---
Disagree, I've ran it for quite awhile and I've found no impact on NPCs, whether running one piece or a full set. If there was any, it was minimal. I've since switched to unyielding.
---
nice!!! dont have the "caps" for it though lol
---
some melee ones i think. bear arms?
---
You cant display power armor. And you honestly dont need more than 2 suits, one excavator for mining lead and one for combat. Any others are just you collecting and they should be stored on an alt character if so.
---
What level are you? Unless the level 50 armour and weapons are god roll legendaries perfect for your build I would think twice about keeping them. That's some advice I was given upon starting: don't hang onto things way above your level.
---
I'm level 22
---
Yeah I know but my point is that if you wanted to collect and display all power armors you should be able to do that imo
---
Well with Gun-Fu and Adrenaline I useally dispatch swarm of mobs easily with lever-action. By far most bang per buck with that one. But 15% faster reload is a must.
---
Atoms are unrelated to Fallout 1st Subscription
---
Yeah well they havent incorporated that into the game yet and if they do, it will take up stash space and camp budget just as everything else does.
---
yes please!!!! my psn is randymoppins. ill be on in the morning EST
---
Done that in first 30 minutes and couple of server hops. 
---
First, Crickets spawn not only outside, but also inside - I found few dead outside, but when I get inside there were at least 3 alive (killed one, left rest for others).
---
Second, there are at least 3 locations in SD you can check for radscorpions - Middle Mountain Cabins, The Freak Show and Top of the World. You can also use 'team trick' if you have a friend available.
---
Weapons and armour (I'm talking normal armour as opposed to power armour - someone else will have to advise you on that) are pretty easy to come by and especially at level 50, when you should be making decent caps to purchase from vendors. Have you opened a store yet to sell all the junk you don't need? I try to only keep 100 each of every resource item for my own use and sell the rest. I keep more of things like steel, lead, acid and cloth for ammo. Price everything reasonably and it will fly out of your stash!
---
I sell most of my junct to the vendors when I get it

Here's the test I ran because this dispute keeps coming up due to a really stupid video captainnoob posted. This video failed to adequately identify the difference between Sneak (a PvE element) and Stealth/Chameleon (a PvP element that has no influence on NPCs). When running their own tests, most people neglect the fact that many items affect Sneak, such as the Agility SPECIAL stat. They also test against low-Perception NPCs that are easily overcome with small amounts of Sneak. 
---
Test 1) Equipped 5 pieces of Chameleon armor on a low-Agility character. No other Sneak/Agility perks or bonuses. Attempted to hide from a Level 91 Deathclaw (high Perception NPC) by crouch/Sneak movements. Result: Constant "Danger" status and several attacks by Deathclaw. Moving even slightly resulted in an immediate attack. Impossible to exit "Danger" status once spotted.
---
Test 2) Using a character with 5 Unyielding pieces of armor with 32 Agility, the Level 3 Sneak perk, no other Sneak-related bonuses, and absolutely no Chameleon/Stealth of any kind, I was able to crouch/Sneak/move freely around the same level 91 Deathclaw. When I was actively moving and in view of the Deathclaw, I would be in "Caution" status. When I stopped moving, I would return to "Hidden" status. I was even able to fire my weapon near the Deathclaw without it being able to see me.
---
Conclusion: Chameleon has 0 impact on your ability to evade NPCs. Sneak gained through perk cards, Agility points, Legendary gear, etc is the primary determining factor in your ability to evade NPCs. Captainnoobs's video was extremely misleading. By failing to isolate the variables, his video has led several Fallout players to believe that Chameleon alone allowed him to overcome the low-Perception detection abilities of the NPCs in his video.
---
They are probably weighing if they can get away with an atom charge each time you want a new map.  lol.   Ahhhh my favorite franchise is dead.
---
Either free scrap-box for everyone or make FO76 Free-To-Play and give 1-2 months of 1st subscription to those that purchased the game.
---
People like you make me happy to use reddit. Good conversation that's ends in us killing stuff lol.
---
Handmades and Fixers are the best automatic rifles.
---
Semi-auto implies a sniper build, though, since automatic rifles consistently provide higher DPS, so the only good reason to use semi-autos, outside of RP, is because you want to one-shot-sneak-kill stuff from a distance. An instigating lever action is the best gun for this play style.
---
Well damn. I guess I just looked at the menu, had seen the laser turrets locked (I didn't have science active) and assumed that, not only everything else was locked but they were all locked do to lack of plans. 
---
Well, people asking was probably not necessary. Each loading screen lasts one "season" (major DLC). It was supposed to be Wastelanders right now, but since it is delayed we go back to default.
---
See, this is the kind of stuff I'd actually spend atom on
---
Well, I for one do not want the junior programmer/interns that fixes some of these small things to try and fix the big bugs. That would be... catastrophical. I am glad we get small things fixed, because most likely it does not take any time what so ever away from the larger projects (Wastelanders) or major bug fixes. At least that is how bug fixing works at my work place.
---
Idk about anyone else but menu music has sorta gone down the drain. I usually find myself muting any menu music nowadays, and the Nuclear Winter theme just gave me the biggest headache. I'd take off my headset while in the menu until I found a lobby.
---
Maybe on a junkies or bloodied build you can one shot the mobs, but for a situation like the whitespring clubhouse (plenty of enemies on a small area) I'd rather use a handmade. Then again, there is no reason not to carry both.
---
I agree with you on the scrap box - but i dont see happening.
---
This is exactly the same thing as is tied into the premium subscription on Elder Scrolls online and they never reverted that decision there either.
---
I've been saying this for months now, and it's good to (yet again) have affirmation of this. Chameleon does NOT influence NPCs. That is a PvP-only element. I've seen it again and again and again - players using between 1 and 5 Chameleon armor pieces trying to attack my camp in Survival (RIP) would get wrecked by my resident Deathclaw, which had no trouble whatsoever seeing them. It would march right up to the invisible player and smack them across their bewildered faces. Several controlled tests have confirmed this.
---
Sneak is what influences NPCs. You can find armor pieces with both Sneak and Chameleon effects on them, because the two are not the same.
---
I use this in NW also. With the final Scorchbeast, you can force it to change targets by proper understanding of Sneak vs Chameleon.
---
Couldn't disagree more - my own testing using similar non-scientific means proved the absolute opposite.  Wonder if we'll ever know the truth.
---
YMMV I guess.  My experience is absolutely different to yours.
---
Tried it sufficiently - happy that chameleon does stack, and IS effective against NPCs.  L290 so I guess it's been working well enough for a while.
---
I had it happen in the nuke silo felt like I was being tased by the turrets.
---
GIVE ME BACK MY FIYAH!!!
---
PSA - People need to learn what PSA means...
---
Yeah it happened to me there too. Idk what's going on.
---
One day is 72 minutes. 72 / 24 = 3
---
Sorry you feel that way buddy. While I am still enjoying F76 immensely myself, I do simultaneously hope that a good team of Developers are currently working on making a great Fallout 5 singleplayer game (with optional co-op) using all the best stuff learned from all the previous games.
---
Laggy as hell after patch. Blue screened more than I have since BETA. triggered AF.
---
I managed to escape them but I was in power armor so not sure if that helped lol. It seems to be a new issue with the new patch would be my guess since I‚Äôve never had this happen before.
---
As a melee build I find stagger kind of OK, it keeps me from analy butt fucking scorchbeasts
---
I love co-op and so many games could have it just by letting a friend take over an NPC or doing it Baldur's Gate style which allows for dividing up NPC control but also having more player made characters but only the host is the real protagonist.
---
Hell! Fallout 4 could have accommodated it just by letting you have a Co-Op Game where both parents lived and went looking for their kid together.
---
What system you on?
---
You mean I can just throw my chameleon armor away?
---
Doesn't work like that. If that was democracy, society would collapse. "Free Ferraris and lobster for everyone? Yay or nay?". Guess the outcome...
---
As a former bloodied melee build I understand.
---
Do you have a video showing low Agility, no Sneak whatsoever with Chameleon alone keeping you invisible to a Level 91 Deathclaw? No one has ever been able to produce such a video when they've made their claim that Chameleon makes them invisible to NPCs.
---
yes, wastelanders will be make or break. I just hope BGS realizes this.
---
There was just an update [last month](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more). They're probably not going to be updating you on a weekly basis about it.
---
Yeah, was super fun standing in camp when the nuke hit and everything except a water purifier got destroyed. Luckily, another nuke was dropped nearby and destroyed that one as well.
---
Couldn't even be mad xD
---
Ugh that would have been perfect! Won‚Äôt be able to get online until later.
---
Here's my video showing that Sneak/Agility alone produces the desired effect on NPCs. No one has ever produced a video to prove that Chameleon can do this without the assistance of Agility or other Sneak perks.

Noooo thank you. Dying Light was anxiety inducing enough.

Never changed my icon not something I care about

Yes, it's in the Atomic Shop for 300 Atoms
---
It's not really dependant on build 650+ damage dealt is fine to kill the ghouls everywhere. Ofc if you go guns blazing, there is no way to dispatch them quick and clean, I usually go and headshot 7 or 8 in VATS, kill 2 manually while my AP is ready to eliminate the other ones that are near me.
---
I did it with my Suppresor's western revolver on my ginslinger build as well.

FFR Black powder rifle.

I dont think that is correct, more like 100% / 25% per shot.
---
Dose it work aid and hats aswell? Looks great btw!!
---
That's part of the major problem on here. Irrational self indulgent temper tantrums have been allowed to run rampant and unchecked and I'm turn all that has happened is that official commentary and interaction by Bethesda has dropped off because no matter what people couldn't be reasonable and bother to respond like adults instead of impotently raging about an issue that while perhaps incredibly important to them, is truly only affecting a small select handful of people or is significantly more complicated fixes that these armchair coders have genuinely zero comprehension on what it truly takes to fix.
---

good idea, I'll check if there's a little tick box I can uncheck

You're completely right but around here any attempts to think logically and not just wildly rage about inconsequential things will be downvoted, so....

Savage Divide and Mire are level with your Current level, but the towers in those areas are limited, and one frequently drops in to the Bog.

You will get loads more for putting it in your vendors. Be aware of the things that do and don't sell though and don't bother junking up your stash with those. Stuff like rubber, cork, glass, bone, ceramic, cloth don't tend to shift well. And don't waste the plastic bulking unless you are bulking steel (I sell it bulked for 25 caps and it's very popular). Plastic also sells well, as does aluminium, lead, acid, gears, screws, springs. Be sensible with your prices and stock will move very quickly and you'll always have a steady supply of caps.

This confused me, too. You have to do the big quest at Dolly Soda and any three merit badges. I recommend Archery, Swimming, and Athletics as the least tedious.
---
Another player mentioned the toxic goo clean-up that you can do at Kiddie Corner in the Toxic Valley. I don't remember having to do that, but, as others have said, it was a while ago.
---
Now is the turn to put some plans in the world for free.

Did them both, just server hop.

Either way, what the crap is causing infinite stagger lol.

It should have come with the implementation of wallpapers. Just saying.

Me and you are the only ones up tonight lol
---
**Bugs** I rechecked so far and are still there, PC, Adventure, No 1st membership
---
* Craft-scrap loop for 1 free steel. Great for completing the "Craft, scrap armor, weapons 0/100" challenge for free as there is no resource loss.
---
* Crafting 1 Bufftats and 1 Psychobuff completes the "Craft chems 0/5" challenge as if their ingredients themselves count as being crafted.
---
**QoL**
---
* Have more places in the Savage Divide spawn Radscorpions (challenge related). I server hopped 50 times to find no RS at the Middle Mountain Cabins or at the Top of the World, only Yao Guai or Honeybeasts. Also killing RS at the WS park don't count towards this challenge despite WS is supposed to be in the Savage Divide (?).
---
* Option to have the PA/Pipboy lamp always turned on. Currently, if I have it on and when I fast travel during the day or change between interior and exterior, the lamp turns off most of the time.
---
* My #1 death cause is poison damage from mobs (now humanoid Scorched too?) overstacking and being in PA, there is no mitigation other than spamming super stims. Tone back the poison damage or provide remedies such as poison resist pills or something.
---
Not gonna lie, I like this. This is what id spend my farming atoms on and would very much like :)
---
every time the purveyor tries to conjure up a shyte roll
---
But they are advertising; join Fallout 1st; monthly best value atoms. You should win the monthly price: idiot of the month.
---
finally! my god thank you!
---
this is a thing. can confirm. NW PS4.
---
Am i missing something? This post makes no sense NW isn't on private servers and has nothing to do with private servers or ur subscription.
---
Yep, that's the reason I collected a full set of heavy combat armour all with weapon weight reduction. It's perfect for everything, I'm never overloaded anymore.
---
convenience shouldn't come out the pocket of the players, kthnx.
---
Sentence structure isn't your strong suit, is it? Anyways, your complaint has nothing to do with Fallout 1st. That bug has been around much longer than 1st has, so all you managed to do was make yourself look stupid.
---
Nice, my build is melee and non auto rifles with perks increasing my physical and energy resistance/damage output. So ill probably have a lever action as my main gun and use a handmade for lower level mobs and crowd control
---
Water Ways... Wavy Willard's... I can see this
---
Noice!!! Thank you. Now i can serve tge top shelf stuff at my bar foreal! üòÖ
---
I expected that, although my original comment is pretty neutral in tone and I didn‚Äôt get downvoted to hell so there‚Äôs that. I‚Äôd like to think that if they could fix certain bugs they would and the fact that they haven‚Äôt is due to complexity and not disregard.
---
what? a usable atom shop thing AND free wallpaper.  its almost like theyre feeling guilty for something.  also... this is p2w
---
i just put up nw of top of the world
---
I just switched it out for a different torso mod...
---
for a second I thought this was just another grain of salt positive post on some insignificant thing related to the game as if it's a big deal. lmao  
---
~~I personally feel like the subreddits mods are purposely trying to put positive posts higher on the page , don't mind my tinfoil hat~~
---

---
Just don‚Äôt use bloodied

Wow, thanks so much for that detailed breakdown! I completely forgot about the awareness perk, and I was unaware that armor penetration effects will change enemy resistance displays.

I appreciate that, exactly what I was looking to find out üëç
---
Become a melee build wont need ammo as much...
---
As  you explore the areas in the cranberry bog you will find piles of something that looks like poo. Those are actually the result of the lag spikes. Everytime that the server takes a crap a new pile spawns. 
---
No one really knows the root cause of the lag spikes, though there are several ideas about the cause floating around. Some of The most likely but disproven ones are, when a new player emerges from the vault the amount of cpu used to create the stash box, this has been disproven since there are not many new players now and the spikes continue. Another one is when someone finds a red asylum outfit, again disproven because the lag spikes happen much more often than players with that outfit. So to this date we can see the results but not the cause of these spikes.
---
Already had to repair twice in 1 day.
---
Nah we got shit.
---
I'd say yes, its so damn handy and I'd struggle to play without it now (got at least 200lbs of shit in there and an almost full stash box), something else would have to replace it though. The stash box and a private world make 1st worth it for me.
---
I‚Äôm not saying anything els, just use the stuff you can to your advantage. 
---
Btw I lol‚Äôd at the patch notes since it was missing so much stuff and I havnt heard about or experienced any of the listed bugs. lol
---
I could help you out right now. Just drop your GT or write it in a private msg.
---
Built myself a nice cosy cluttered house and the regular ones just don't fit in, these are just perfect, it's what I expected when they announced displaying items, the other ones are indeed big and chunky.
---
like most of us - it's similar like this flickering light bulb in Watoga they've patched some time ago - completely irrelevant to 99,99% of players. I've been to Monongah once or twice and I could live without possibility to shoot through the window. Really...
---
And the other Fallout games are single player. All I'm saying is if everyone gets unlimited stash, expect areas to be consistently cleared of all items not nailed down. I think unlimited stash was a bad idea in general.
---
Not going to happen
---
Nah, I am not, but it still happens to me even though my in-game resolution is the same as my desktop one.
---
more to bitch about
---
Happened to me very often when I tried to play Fallout 76 last time, and my ISP is perfect, I haven't had a single issue with it in 2019. Restarting seemed to help me.
---
I bet they'll fix it so you can only respawn at the vault and your Tent‚Ñ¢ - Only Available With Fallout‚Ñ¢ First‚Ñ¢
---
Respectfully disagree. The scrapbox in fallout first does not equal the entire game. If they gave private servers and the sex tent to everybody then your analogy would be closer.
---
Makes you a shill because you're excusing the shitty business practices of a shitty company that is taking advantage of you and many others. You may not feel you're being taken advantage of, but that doesn't mean that you are still.
---
The game is a year old and there are many bugs that have persisted since launch. Not to mention, lag, latency, server issues, etc. People have every right to be upset at Bethesda about these issues. If you're not upset, fine. But you can't tell people to shut up and accept a broken game. Again, even if it doesn't bother you or your standards are way lower for what you'll accept as a finished game, fine. Not everyone has to agree and YOU need to accept that and move one. The ones who want the game fixed don't need to move on until the game is fixed.
---
The mutant hound howl is so haunting that it stuns your internet connection.
---
Except what they do with their money directly influences how the devs handle their game. Now they know you'll shill out absurd amounts of money because they decided to hound you for cash instead of making any actual fixes to their severely broken game
---
New "feature" for non-sub players?
---
lol ye I know, that one got a lot of attentionüòÑ
---
I don‚Äôt miss having to check what they fixed, stealth patched (unofficially just broke), after each oatch. Wonder what they caused after this one.
---
Might be time Bethesda actually fixed and finished their game. There, fixed that for ya.
---
add me on psn: Owl_No
---
When you realize they prioritized that over fixing the game! BOOOO!
---
wastelanders
---
Yes, it does not equal, but the issue is the same. You force people to pay for something and then let everyone have it for free. That is just not fair. If we want that to be fair, it has to either be free for everybody or has to be bought by everybody, but selling to some and giving away to others just cannot be fair. Be it a game, a scrapbox or any costume.
---
If NW is a separate game mode and you can't do anything with V51 in Adventure, why is the vault even there in Adventure?
---
Like, what is Bethesda thinking? Who cares if people are jumping through it? To my knowledge, it was a harmless glitch. But the ACTUAL problems with the game, they're ignored for yet another patch. But oh, we need to fix some shrubs and delete a Vault door. That's what's important. Fucking Bethesda...
---
I just hoping for a Fallout 1st flag, either on a pole or wall placeable.
---
I don't think anybody pays attention enough to point out top players
---
i disagree. it‚Äôs a pvp comp mode. people are asking about it on ps4 anyway ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Found a clean (can't  remember the name) white shirt and pants early on in the game, still wear it. Different hats and glasses from time to time.
---
Noticed this on Ps4 as well. Replace wallpaper, all things on walls get stored. Put all things back, suddenly, no budget for wires. Delete stuff to make room. Doesn't work, try to replace things i erased to make room. Budget maxed. Argh!
---
Thanks for your message and help. I have tried restarting and sometimes it works.very temperamental.üòÇ
---
Ah well, I just couldn't pass by without mentioning a Special Olympics joke, so I will have to pay for it with karma.
---
Yeah, I've never taken the time to understand it, and have always just gone off what others say.
---
Thanks for the resources, now I can actually see how it works for myself. And now I am educated and will no longer be sharing incorrect and outdated info.
---
Yes. This needs to be implemented asap.  
---
Also can we please be allowed to use the Pip-Boy when sitting down.
---
(Sometimes) it just works.
---
So who do you think are the best players, maybe if you threw some names out it would help stimulate the conversation my guy
---
in what universe is something as minor as ''needing to reload 
---
 your gun after restarting the game'' inexcusable? extremely minor levels of annoying sure, but inexcusable?
---
The PA bug was inexcusable, the nonstop crashing is inexcusable, something that is a minor inconvenience at worst is not inexcusable.
---
The classic theme fits the game so well!
---
Imagine if they replaced it with ESO's double XP bonus. People would shout p2w even harder. Maybe they have double cap drops from enemies like ESO's double gold bonus?
---
Thanks for the reply. Should really be free in perpetuity, like the terminal. Guess a quick re-install is in order.
---
For semi-autos it goes Lever&gt;Fixer&gt;Handmade and for full autos it goes Fixer&gt;Handmade in terms of damage
---
Is the engineering section locked? Can it be picked/hacked
---
Bethesda had a "beta" that was actually just an early access stress test called the "Break it Early Test Application," before the original launch of Fallout 76.
---
What I'm proposing is a new beta using the same name as the first one.
---
Lol an adult game? Wtf does that mean, this isn't a fucking adult game, it's a video game, which means mostly kids under 18 will be playing it.
---
Certain Gamers: Stop releasing buggy updates/maps too early
---
Also certain (the same?) gamers: Why is this still being tested / in beta..
---
ü§î
---
Ps4 confirmed. It would definitely be nice if they found a way for us to load in at same time like any other battle royal out there. 
---
There are times I watch people I'm playing with on twitch loot up and get a kill before iI even load in. Not even mentioning the twitch latency itself. Other times, iI load in too quick and have to wait standing there for the crates to load. 
---
Nuclear Winter needs some love. Atleast figure this shit out so we all start with equal advantage.
---
I wouldn't compare NW with actual athletics but I would compare you to a piece of shit lol
---
I was only thinking at weekend that they really needed ti do this
---
Little did I know! üëçüèª
---
That's a good one - so simple yet they never fix it.
---
I wouldn't even argue.
---
Well, I want to hear it.
---
I missed out on the original üòü didn't even realize it says those cool phrases until I run into someone wearing it the only thing holding me back is the price tag
---
And it's only 300. 
---
That's easily grindable in a couple days.
---
What card are you wanting?
---
Between 15 and 19 seconds faster. I play in the mornings w/1 other guy. He is in 15 to 19 seconds b4 me everytime.  Sux when you finally spawn in and someone's standing in front of you with a combat shotgun. It is easy to follow a stealthed person, so  goodbye 3 to 5min of loading, hello next 3 to 5min of loading.
---
Forest camo jumpsuit and either the green asylum hat or assault gas mask, oh and the coffin backpack

probs other names should be there. this is based on my opinion, actual skill, team mate ability, ability to use a wide variation of weapons. Ability to give a good fair fight. 
---
you next?
---
Simple - bug priorities should be fixing the ones causing the most inconvenience to players rather than making changes that doesn't even affect gameplay at all - stupid stuff like recoloring the scrap box.  The longer term issues are not touched because its clear Bethesda's priorities is focused 100% on monetization - you can see this in a patch that heavily focuses on atomic store and 1st items.
---
I don't even have issues with their sub offering but not fixing the bugs that are affecting everyone clearly shows the suits are running the show, which is very unfortunate because they are even going to drive off their subs cause of bugs that go unaddressed while they mess with stupid stuff.
---
Whitesprings is where the traffic is.  As long as your camp is in sight when people swing their maps over the Whitesprings you will get traffic.  There are some flat spots near The Vantage.
---
I assume we will see some form of new item each month in order to garner new subscribers. As for the scrap box, no.
---
i kinda wish they had a choice between the two in settings or soemthin
---
Sorry you are wrong. The spot that is taken by cave crickets can be radrats or wolves at least. So at best a 1/3 chance. Unlucky rng can have you hopping alot.
---
Master rifleman
---
That, or I‚Äôm being optimistic here, many of the requests could be implemented during Wastelanders
---
No offense, because I'm sure it was annoying, but if that's your only run in with a toxic player than you are pretty lucky. Super edgy racial slurs aside, that was a really mild story.
---
Likes I say, I don't pay attention enough. I spawn in alone and usually hide, only won one NW solo, all my other wins were with friends. My friend General_Shiest is pretty good but he stopped playing once he got that hellfire armor. The only player I really recognize is someone who kept spawning at the same spot as me, and once he quit immediately after killing me to queue into my next game and try it again lol. KC_Royals, I recognize his name now but that's like the only person
---
can you display notes on it?
---
Good point. I never could finish that end-game quest where I had to build a display shelf to finally finish this game, so it's absurd that we have to pay for this now!
---
Probably if you could see the stats you would see just how bad NW is performing and how large the hacking problem is. I think they are intentionally letting it die out so they can cut it like Survival mode.
---
Oh, ok, I guess that make sense.
---
I mean, if you want to make a bunch to endure a long time...
---
Yep, that's what I'm pointing out. It's like people forgot.
---
Okay thats it, im grinding for it! brb
---
OK, so that's broken too, right?  I have seen my character get sludge lung, but it never updates.

It‚Äôs a looter shooter with some RPG elements, but anything you do doesn‚Äôt really make much difference since the world resets and everything respawns after a day.
---
@Looch_P I‚Äôm on PS4?  You?
---
Hey, some of us a horny and depressed in our 50s
---
Hi I‚Äôm not playing the game by 1-2 months, so sorry if I ask but now is possible display objects in our camp like that or is this a mod?
---
I can agree that 1800 is a bit high,but cannot agree on the atom income. There are 500-650 atoms available x week. In 20 days it means you would only have to have 700 atoms from yourself.
---
It‚Äôs the stock color, there are wooden stocks for the hunting rifles and then there are the grey carbon fiber stocks. It just depends what mod is in the stock part
---
Thank you so much. :)
---
What? No. If they go f2p people that purchased the game should get everything for free like they promised. Everything except cosmetic items. Fallout 1st should be free, they said free content, only pay for cosmetics.
---
Leather coat, green hood, wraparound goggles.
---
Or the bug where the first time you die, or get out of your power armor, it drops your carry weight by 100 lbs, until you log off and log back on
---
which team? if there is only one man in the office xD he distributes the coffee, does the cleaning, develops and pays the salary XD
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter, shut up.
---
Finally.  Like someone else said...now we just need wall shelves and the metal shelves like all the garages and workshops in the game world have.
---
Everything should be free, they said only cosmetics would be paid for.
---
You say that we can't bring up the fact that you earn atoms, but you probably haven't even gotten all of the "craft or scrap X type of weapons" though OP, you don't try to earn those atoms. I'm level 304, and I still have hundreds of atoms I haven't redeemed. The problem is you want it, and that's why you complain about the price
---
I've actually had a bunch of new bugs today.  I was using my 10mm pistol, that has a 15 round magazine normally, had 95 rounds in the mag after FT, to my camp.  My Gatling laser took no wear damage.  I switch between that, and my minigun.  The mini took normal wear.  the laser took none.
---
 Everything should be free, they said only cosmetics would be paid for.
---
Carry weight is messed up after you take food too - it never recalculates right after having a rad ant lager or radstag, etc.
---
Protecc and serve.
---
Everything should be free, they said only cosmetics would be paid for. 
---
Make the game good and people will buy it.

Never noticed the wear issue but weapons not showing correct ammo is definitely real and has been around for a long time.  I know switching between say a gatling gun and some other weapons has at times resulted in other weapon at some point coming up with hundreds of rounds (basically whatever I had left in the gatling from the last time I used it) and you can't reload it until you're under its mag capacity.
---
I think I still have a shotgun currently stuck in that state.
---
They said only cosmetics would be paid for.
---
Uh no. He complains about the price cause it's 20 bucks for one cosmetic. Lol are you a joke?
---
Ohh ok I don‚Äôt play minecraft so didn‚Äôt have a clue. Tridents would be cool tho
---
Hey you have to be happy that they actualy changed 2 lines of code.
---
interesting. thanks for your response.
---
Can't paint scout armor
---
So you think selling the PA skin for 1800 atoms is a good idea?
---
He complains about the price because he wants it, you don't see anybody complaining about the things they don't wanna buy
---
$18 is not the PA, it's the paintjob. And we all know that paint ain't cheap. As a matter of fact $18 for painting a Power Armor is a steal, if it weren't just in this game.
---
lol ty
---
C L O W N W O R L D
---
Try zooming (out and in, or the other way around). That seems to help.
---
do you play nuclear winter though? sounds like a feeling from a grumbly adv mode player. there are detailed photos about of potential future maps, so don‚Äôt think they intend to phase it out. I am looking forward to wastelanders too, but we have been told we are looking to wait till Q1 of next year anyway. I enjoy both modes and am excited for the future possibilities of the game mode nuclear winter.
---
Until you starve to death. That is too much communism.
---
toxic ness. no thank you.
---
lmao
---
It's a good idea for Bethesda's wallet, because the people who want it are gonna buy it, if they kept the prices low on everything people would only farm atoms for things. Bethesda wants your money, not your atoms
---
You're right no one is complaining about the things they don't want. That's common sense. But I see alot of people complaining about how stuff is too expensive and I tend to agree with them.
---
If it's just a skin and Beth don't start to make free skin very crap, let they sell as much expensive as they want...
---
Just you wait fella
---
It‚Äôs irritating and frustrating that Bethesda can do a million things wrong, ignore and alienate their fan base, make an incomplete game and refuse to fix bugs, but they do one thing right, and people are singing their praises. This sub is like an abusive relationship. Some people are smart enough to jump ship. Some aren‚Äôt. 
---
I‚Äôve been a huge fan of Fallout for quite a while now, but this propaganda is the last straw for me. 
---
Fuck you Bethesda for ruining what could have been a really amazing game. Shame on the rest of you for putting up with this shit and allowing them to get away with the shit that they have been.
---
Hey I'm on your side man lol
---
Yep, definitely been experiencing this. Every time I spawn on an orange dinger with another player, there's a 50% chance they've opened it, grabbed the goods and run off before I've faded in.
---
In that context, i understand. And it highlights yet another Fallout Worst Problem. Good, that Bethesda told us they would never implement something which makes the experience worse for some players.
---
\^\^exacatly\^\^
---
Hey I recognize you. You've got mad NW skills mate.
---
When you whisper to the void, does it whisper back?
---
Why would you want to take some ones workshop?
---
I hadn't seen the weapon with the over ammo before.  I checked, and it indeed does go down, and I cannot reload it.  They said the armor thing should be fixed now.  None of my armor has been wearing down, or a negligible amount.  Today, two pieces were close to breaking.  My heavies normally don't last to long.  But the laser took no damage, at all, today.
---
I agree as well but the reason everything is so high is because they allow us to farm atoms, if things were low people would only farm atoms and not drop any cash. Personally I already do that, I've only bought one atom bundle before after a year of playing. They want money not atoms. Why not farm the atoms to mitigate the cost at least?
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
I mean run and gun lol phone typo lol
---
Simplest answer: because there are morons out there that will buy it. If they wouldn't, Bethesda wouldn't price it so high. As you said, it's worth more than the base game. Than a month of 1st. It's ridiculous.
---
Some people may be OK with giving Bethesda more money for shit like this, when the base game itself is still as buggy as it was at launch, but not me.
---
&gt; Ok, get to level 200 and let's see how many atoms you're able to earn weekly 
---
Fallout 76 noob here.  Is it harder to earn atoms at higher levels? Ive collected enough atoms for the fridge, but if they get harder to earn, maybe I should save them for something else.
---
Yup... Wallpaper.... CONTENT
---
When you create a game where players share resources it's never a good idea to give anyone unlimited stashes without a work around. ESO does it right where there are objects in areas that vary from player to player. If I loot a sword, that sword is no longer in that world in my game but it's still in yours. We can be standing side by side and we'll see different things.
---
2 questions. Are you lv 67 or 21? And what perk cards are you using.
---
You can look at the challenges page and decide how hard those are. Dailies and weeklies *have* gotten harder as the game's life went on, they used to give atoms out like candy but started making them harder on dailies
---
I would suggest stealthing to get close to them or get them to chase you around a corner (don't want to be charging them on open ground till you/your gear can take a few hits
---
lol wrong person
---
Why is the craft acrap loot and issue? steel is easy to get
---
Jesus Christ, it's like they don't even tell the designers they're making things for a *Fallout* game.
---
You can earn about 1200 atoms/mo pretty easily. You don‚Äôt need to buy everything you see in the atomic shop.
---
But they don't want to farm atoms, that's the problem
---
But if it's a site wide no-no, what difference does it make?
---
Just save up your atoms for things you really want. I only buy stuff I absolutely can‚Äôt live without on the atom store and this power armor was one of them. It‚Äôs really awesome and quotes liberty prime while you‚Äôre killing stuff.
---
I just want to go back at killing Slavers, Canibals, and other psychopaths of the Wasteland.
---
I actually feel like the daily/weeklies have gotten easier recently. They were definitely difficult a few months back but seem to be easier to power through now
---
This game is rated M (mature). Not a kids game.
---
Oh good old days where when it asked you only to level up but now you need to level up while below lvl 76 while wearing a Responders outift while in Flatwoods or any other zany combinations they can think of.
---
To name a few, in no particular order.
---
TrillCosby and his AE crew (don‚Äôt see em as much now)
---
Raybear 
---
Alien_Ian 
---
Cerberus 
---
(Death)Peacetohippies
---
ArsonCuff 
---
Tachyongun
---
Preston
---
And many many more...
---
There‚Äôs just a lot...depending on the lobby. But there‚Äôs always people to look out for. I just remember most these names even from flatwoods. Always an interesting encounter whenever we fight these names.
---
The entire purpose was to bring some positivity to a sub that's full of vitriol and negativity surrounding everything Bethesda says and/or does.
---
But, fuck it...
---
They want to swim in nothing but filth, be my guest...
---
*1800 atoms
---
Ooooh trust me. Quite a bunch of us are aware of who‚Äôs who. On PS4 at least.
---
Oh yeah they did get a little easier, like they started bringing back the "drink a Nuka Cherry +20 atoms" challenge for dailies. I suspect it's because of F1st, they're making cash from that now, so they're slacking up on challenges. But I still think "level up 0/3" is the scummiest change, and they're not bringing back plain old "level up +10 atoms" any time soon :(
---
I remember that answer. Seems to be different for players though. With dense and fireproof 3 I can shoot a the ground all day with explosive ballistic weapons but with an energy weapon I die immediately if I hit a tree that is within 10 feet of me. I don't feel like I see any difference now on enemies but definitely I can not 'ignore' the explosive dmg on an energy weapon the way I can a ballistic weapon.
---
Reminds me of release day!
---
EXACTLY GAAAAH I MISS THE EASY ONES, FARMING ATOMS WAS ALMOST FUN THEN
---
Yes, yes it does!
---
Level up 0/3 isn‚Äôt that bad. I just have to wear my asylum outfit with sunglasses and get it in one swoop.
---
Definitely
---
South savage divide. It's close enough to whitesprings for ft, and reduces travel costs to watoga area.  Easily make 10k a day vending there, if you got the goods.
---
Yeah when it's outfit related, sometimes it's a specific weapon and such with no outfits
---
I think there are two different versions. 
---
The other one I wear a tux and am well fed. 
---
There may also be one where I need to be intoxicated while in a clown outfit. Also not difficult. 
---
I‚Äôve never had to actually use a specific weapon.
---
Well im just doing the dailys/weeklys now till Wastelanders so ive built up a decent amount :)
---
2-handed weapons are too slow to be effective for me. Have you thought of going 1 handed or - even better - unarmed? Get something with 40% swing speed and together with the Martial Artist perk you'll be unstoppable!
---
I have the opposite problem with my PipBoy Light, when I Fast Travel, it turns on my light 75% of the time, not good for a Stealth Character.
---
I haven't noticed a big change in Poison damage in general, but the SB Piss is absolutely melting me, if unable to get out of the area quickly, death is certain, as I can't Stim quickly enough to survive, to make matters worse, the SBQ made 6 consecutive passes last night leaving the entire Field of Battle in a Poison Piss Fog that also seems to dissipate much slower than normal, many died, multiple times.
---
finally a voice of reason. I've noticed (at least here) a majority of the complaints are from console players and it seems the edge there goes to the PS by a large margin with XB running second. I see quite a few PC players (myself included)  say they've never experienced a lot of the bugs people are mentioning. Makes me wonder how much is a hardware issue and the difficulty comes from fixing it for one platform without breaking it on another. If they knew how to fix them, they would. Everyone talks like it's so easy but if it were that easy they would have fixed a lot of it by now. some of them are probably harder to figure out or have multiple reasons why they're happening and they can't nail them all down, the ones they fix are the ones they figured out. Anyone who thinks a company deliberately leaves their product broken is an idiot.
---
ill rather pay 18$ than buy lootboxes ala tf2
---
Sorry, new character is lvl 21. 
---
S6 - Slugger 3, Martial Artist 3  
---
P1 - Picklock  
---
E2 - Rejuvenated 2   
---
C4 - Lone Wanderer 3  
---
I5 - Makeshift Warrior 4, First Aid 1   
---
A5 - Action Boy 3, Born Survivor 2  
---
L1 - Scrounger (only luck card I have lol)
---
LOL truth
---
i needed ammo
---
It looks like grey wood.
---
Intentionally letting it die? Then why are they adding new NW challenges/rewards in a few weeks?
---
Not really sure about all that. I'm not even 1/4 of the way to 200. I haven't spent any atoms and opening up a second character has also bumped my atom count significantly. 
---
I'm just shy of 4,000 right now and there's still nothing of interest. Paint jobs and skins are so overrated and it's disgusting.
---
I think the mothman cult is returning for wastelanders. I have seen some of their dark stuff around.
---
Make mine a double!
---
Ok you'll want to get this when you level up more.|Incisor - melee weapons ignore enemy armor - Level 34| Also make sure you always have psycho on you so your melee hits do more damage. Power armor will also help you not get slapped out of the air like a bloatfly.
---
strangler heart
---
legs: calibrated 
---
arms: none
---
chest: normally reactive, have yet to find ultra plans
---
head: targeting hud
---
This is becoming more regular
---
Do you remember how they said, everything should be free, only cosmetics would be paid for?
---
Get yourself some good legendary super sledge or grognak axe with power attack and swing speed.
---
Ok, I'll try that. Thanks!
---
Fury
---
Ih you'll get them one day, for $14 an item, in the aroma shop, or a "convenient" $85 bundle.
---
Got a new one for you - cores are no longer shootable in nuclear silos.
---
Yeah, I've been searching for a set of power armor but it's hard to find any this low-level. Guess I will keep slogging on for now. Thanks!
---
Where the hell am I supposed to get catnip? How about some nice cream and softshell mirelurk meat?
---
Been searching for months for a swing speed knife I'm sol üò•
---
Yeah, I dislike how slow they are too, even with martial artist maxed. And if I miss a swing...oh boy, now it's \*really\* too slow lol. Are unarmed builds actually viable?
---
\&gt; If I could kill enemies before they have time to attack me 
---
True.  Taking a hit or 3 is an occupational hazard of a melee build.  
---
As much as I would like to run around showing off my char and cool outfits, the DR of the armor I have doesn't cut it for the high level bots and ghouls... thus the other reason I live in PA.
---
that skull on the bottom shelf is loving it too lol.
---
You mean, why do something totally meaningless?
---
Few months ago it was because of too many friends. Something with the sync of trophies or something
---
I had this problem all the time a few months ago and someone suggested using the back door instead. I've been doing that ever since because I'm superstitious and it hasn't crashed once.
---
My biggest wish would be to be able to stab children that steal from me like in the good old days, and then eat their corpses.
---
How dare you thank bethesda
---
I agree its overpriced. But I think they justify it because of the free atoms atoms they give away
---
I don't have shotgun build, but I play with pistols since start.
---
Pistol is weaker ther rifle, and more expensive, but pistol is very, very interesting in game. With only pistols you can kill scorchbeast queen solo, you can farm most mobs with headshots... It's very fun!
---
I try to build shotgunner, bet he's very close shooter to me. Pistols has much more range
---
I mean... they are winter themed rewards...which is why they are coming out later. I don‚Äôt see them getting rid of it, they would also be erasing all the lore in the vault. If you suggest they just open the vault and remove level locks for certain areas that would be extremely boring. 
---
You may not like NW but a lot of us do. It‚Äôs well executed.
---
Happens at thunder mountain as well...
---
This is a really old bug. And when I say really old, I mean it happens in Skyrim.
---
gUn iS bLaCk nOw, OwO
---
Let's say a new power armor paint comes out. It's a limited time offer and only last 3 weeks. It costs 1800 atoms. Do you think without paying any money and farming for atoms at a normal rate(not day and night grinding) could you acquire that much atoms to get it before it goes away?.... to be honest we both agree on the same thing let's just stop arguing lol
---
They literally don't care about the game anymore. It's a shit game and it still made them millions. They got their money and THEN realized that the game was shit and said fuck this, left the game with a small group of devs and walked away with Santa's magic bag filled with dollar bills. They don't care and they're not going to listen, as if they ever really have.
---
PS4: not just wallpaper but anything. Once I hit max budget, I frequently have to remove two stored items to place back one item. I know not all items take up the same camp budget but it also happens with similar stuff. Like if I want to place a lighted poster of the second tier, removing one lighted poster of tier 1 doesn't decrease the budget enough.  Only when I remove the tier 1 poster from my stored stuff and an other item of my stored stuff, I can place the tier 2 poster...
---
Whats going to take for all these glitches to get fixed? Do they just need a whole new engine?
---
Yea... rated M. M stands for mature. You have to be 18 to buy a game rated Mature.
---
Sweet, thanks buddy.
---
I have tried all 3 types of melee build (alongside an alt that's a sneak rifle build) and unarmed is by far the strongest and my most favourite. The gauntlets and power fists have superior base damage. I run an instigating swing-speed mole miner gauntlet and it can kill every ghoul from the golf club at speed. I also run an instigating 40% power attack damage power fist and deathclaw gauntlet and they totally slay when you're sneaking. I can get in hits of 5000+ with the right conditions.also you only need to max out 1 perk card to get the best out of unarmed, leaving you with 6 points to spend on other things.
---
That sounds fair ;)
---
You also forgot to mention that you have to be a melee build for this to profitable. And if you're a melee build in the first place why do you need acid?
---
Bethesdas image doesn't matter to zenimax. They would probably let the company burn if it would make them miney
---
Firsties need something to buy with all those monthly atoms. This makes it seem they are getting their money's worth out of the subscription.
---
I was teamed up. Besides, shouldn't have to server hop to complete a challenge.
---
That sounds absolutely terrific. Thanks!
---
I have Excv, 51, 60, Ult, and X01.  All except the Ultracite have Targeting hud, motion assist servos (+2 STR), optimized bracers (reduced AP cost for power attacks), and calibrated shocks.   (As a melee build, the Str and power attack bonuses are quite useful.)
---
 I used Excavator exclusively from L45 - L138 or so, (until I was able to get my weight down to a more acceptable level.)
---
Once I did that, I changed to 51 or X01 for a different look, DR is great, but I end up switching back to excavator for its carry weight.
---
I've seen/heard/read some people frowning upon the practice, but yes, I've survived more than one SBQ battle in excavator.
---
Same here. Never once played Nuclear Winter itself since I hate that type of game mode, but the NW music was a jam for me.
---
PA stands are for crafting, it is a type of workbench in this game.
---
I‚Äôm glad to hear that!
---
There's some really great stories in the game, they're just told as flashbacks.
---
The free states stuff is pretty awesome.
---
My character wears power armor and if I stagger, Im fucked because the fire goes out before I can get to it.
---
Its turned into robots talking to us like we are goddamn babies (Quercus in Arktos lab).
---
I hate how this is being pussified for mass appeal.  I want the dark evil and fucked up shit
---
The Tesla damage/immortal enemies bug made me finally drop this game. I check back at every patch to see if they figured out how to fix it, but no dice so far.
---
I also see that with events and don't no whether or not it is only all the tunneling encounters like mole rats and scorpions.  A big waste of time when the last enemy of the last wave stays underground.
---
Have you tried going away, let the single mongrel take over shop, and then retake it from freshly spawned enemies?
---
Additional oversight: Perk card packs don't give you 1\* cards anymore wich makes it impossible to get golden/animated versions of those cards.
---
And instead of giving you every golden perk card only once until you have 'em all or getting points for duplicates to buy cards like in NW, you (me) get golden Lead Belly 5 times.
---
Additional wish: Increase RNG % or make every mod plan available at vendors. I scrapped every armor I found in 3k hrs and the raider arm is the only armor piece with all mods unlocked. (Give me polished metal armor chest and arms, pleeease!)
---
Nope, not fixed.
---
Actually there were quite a few posts about people wanting to go back to the original, or at least away from the NW theme.
---
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll change again for wastelanders.
---
This raid is the cancer one.  No thankyou
---
Just give it to new players. I Went on a looting spree with a low level guy, and just propped everything for him at the vendor.
---
I really hate the level up quest. I don‚Äôt level up fast, I wear outfits that I like and I have no plans to go to areas where they want me to do it in under certain conditions. I pretty much never get it done. It‚Äôs meant for ambitious new players. Me I just want to go collect five plants and eat bubble gum like the old days.
---
What does the emergency protocols mod do?
---
Thanks great feedback üôè
---
They added a menu volume slider in patch 13 or 14 I believe.
---
I agree, its much better and I've never played NW lol
---
Tbh, the theme looked pretty bad and the OG as everyone is saying looks much, much better
---
Don't think of it as 18 dollars, think of it as around two months of challenge grind.
---
Do you feel that the Tesla chest makes a big difference, is the damage noticeable?
---
You can wear outfits for all of them:
---
1. Sunglasses + full Asylum uniform
---
2. Faschnacht Mask + Responder gear
---
3. Formal Wear + Well Fed
---
4. Full Clown Outfit + Well-Fed/Well-Tuned
---
Those are the variations I remember. Somewhere in the above is Power Armor + Group which can be simpler for some people.
---
For semi auto, lever action or fixer (combat rifle).
---
Fallout 1st should be free, they said only cosmetics would be paid for. 
---
 Just give it to new players. I Went on a looting spree with a low level guy, and just propped everything for him at the vendor.
---
My exact thoughts. I want to like this game and at its core it‚Äôs a game I would like but after year we are still experiencing the same bugs, same content and overall the game being in a bad state since launch, this game is by all metrics a bad game
---
But you don't NEED this to play, you already have a free camp.
---
And mine with 16 times the detail
---
Old bug that won't be fixed.
---
With many players now having a 1st subscription, and adding more non-scrap inventory to the game, I suspect the servers are getting overburdened by Hoarded items.
---
T51b with jet pack, targeting HUD,  and callibrated shocks for everyday use.  The T51b is a friggin' tank. It really takes a beating from both energy and ballistic ammo; I can't remember the last time I actually had to repair a piece of it, but when I do the repairs are cheap and easy.  The only downside is that it has the worst rad resistance of all PA model, so if I'm going into a nuke zone, I'll swap it out for my X-01.
---
T60 I don't use so much PA and very cheap to repair.
---
Pumpkin short suit + white wolf fedora.
---
The damage bug has been there since forever, they had it fixed for a time but it came back.  Same thing with favorites getting mixed up on the wheel when you have more than 1 of the same weapon - it was fixed for a short period and is back again.
---
Molerats inadvertently spawned inside the servers themselves
---
Ive consistently had stims "missing" yet was able to see the correct number from the wheel.
---
dont trust the pip-boy...anyone missing something may actually have it, but cant see it. 
---
if you're missing armor, try moving all your armor to your stash, and see if the missing piece shows up.
---
Some of the raider camps and forts in Appalachia a fricken dark.  Heads in shopping carts and bodies on pikes.  I bet we see more of that when the Wastelanders comes out.
---
Not going to happen :p
---
Maybe because it was such a minor correction to be put on the patch note in the first place, just maybe.
---
I grabbed Fallout 1st right away, and one of the first things I noticed with the Scrapbox was how much more convenient it was to not have to worry as much about how much scrap I was storing. There was still other things I had to keep track of better, such as my ammo and aid items, but taking scrap out of the equation is just too nice for everyone to not have. I'd be fine with Fallout 1st keeping the private server, monthly atoms, and some cosmetics here and there behind the pay wall (as long as the cosmetics would eventually be released to everyone else). But absolutely, everyone should have access to the Scrapbox.
---
This was to make up jokes about it
---
For real though a pedestal would be great. I‚Äôd put a bunch of food items on them.
---
OK...
---
NPCs are all Dazed &amp; Confused by the sudden influx of NCR Rangers into West Virginia.
---
One that looks like the column would be nice, and maybe a mothman cult one made of sticks for those weirdos ü§£
---
Level 60+ charred ghouls are terrifying, too agile and at the same time their attacks really hurts. While high level Mr. Handy can easily kill me in just few shots. Any idea how to make me last in battle if there is a swarm of them?
---
I'm one of those weirdos &gt;:(
---
Yeah, a completely cosmetic item is what they should be charging atoms for. They need to get that money and I would much rather this than anything that provides a combat advantage.
---
I'm just kidding tho, that shit looks cool
---
I‚Äôm not sure what to do while waiting for my CAMP to load in other than reload my weapon lol
---
Helmet hair is a bitch ain't it?
---
I had to quit making my character in the vault. I haul ass outside, then do the rest. The only issue I've got with that in the long run is my character selection photos look nothing like my characters.
---
Blocker helps a tonne.
---
And barbarian if you don't intend to use pa which i assume you do.
---
Unarmed isn't possible in pa so keep that in mind
---
Actually i wouldn't mind to have this main menu but with the "coutry roads" theme!!
---
I haven't excused anything. I've just suggested that a guy who is posting 30+ times a day about how much he hates the game might wanna take a breather. 
---
If I saw someone continually poking their finger into shit and tasting it, I'd suggest the same thing. That wouldn't change the fact that shit tastes awful. 
---
&gt;Bethesda doesn't have his money, or mine.
---
Wait - so neither of you bought the game?  Why are you here then? You're freakin' weird. Go ride your high-horse over to a game you did buy, you big ol' lollygagger.
---
Also, blocking helps a lot, it even let's you attack faster if you hit it immediately after a swing
---
It looks great as an ‚Äúaccent wall‚Äù in a room with a busier wallpaper. I‚Äôm a big fan of the ‚Äúthere should be one basic version of everything in the game‚Äù school of thought so a basic wallpaper that doesn‚Äôt look like utter shit is a step in the right direction.
---
They are that high because ppl buy them.
---
Its just supply and demand.  I do nukes often on ps4 and every PA has a skin on it
---
Display cases are available in game now, there are free glass display cases and gun racks in the game, but this one is on the atom store for 300, and is IMO the most cosmetically pleasing.
---
Tuesdays ‚ò¢Ô∏è
---
Many thanks friend!
---
New one looks way better.
---
I've done it multiple times, dumping ammo and plans from my older characters to my newest one. I personally would be afraid of using any of the overseer stuff. I use the moonshine shack right down the hill from Fallout 76. The yellow crate next to the weapons bench is my chosen 'mailbox' and I've used it successfully at least 8-10 times and transfer tons of plans and medst and housands of rounds of ammo. And I set up my survival tent just down the hill from the moonshine shack so if my character is over encumbered I can just hobble down the hill real quick and dumped everything he's carrying
---
I could be wrong on this, but incase you don't get any info from someone else. The preconception that harder to detect not stacking might come from it accidentally being mixed up with Chameleon. Chameleon armor pieces within fallout 4 used to give you harder to detect and stacked with other pieces, but in fallout 76 multiple pieces only slightly affect the LVL of aesthetic appearance and not on actually making you harder to detect within vats in PvP or from creatures.
---
I cannot confirm 100%, but id be surprised if harder to detect does not stack, when the chameleon pieces are already not giving the effect
---
How about you simply wait you vulture.
---
you would hit level 50 with 1800 to 2000 atom, just from playing the game. no grinding or seeking challenges.
---
Those will explode??? Never had one do that.
---
This would finally make ‚ÄúNocturnal‚Äù legendary weapons useful.
---
I just did it but only got about 300 acid, not 500? Waited a while but no more were spawning
---
Yes, this is how things are right now.
---
They never announced it when the showed the atom shop thing for this update, which I thought showed everything for the next few days or so with the new stuff
---
Its more that the NW one was horrible
---

Those two are both 2nd Slot, one or the other.
---
GREEDY AS HELL. Even at 50% off price, I think it's still tooooo expesive to buy.
---
Yes we are.

---
I'm still going to complain. These people got the old main menu back by bitching about it nonstop, and they didn't even have a fucking valid reason, just " it sucks" lol
---
Did does support it's own weight. Your weight gain is from the Backpack and (Deep) Pockets mod on your normal armour no longer applying.
---
We saw the Halloween stuff like a month before the event. It will probably take a week or something to show its face.
---
I would like to see more Pioneer Scout themed items
---
Thanks for saying, I checked in with the team on this bug again and I was mistaken about that workaround, I apologize about that!
---
"just cosmetic"
---
Refrigerator. Scrap collector.
---
Not combat advantage but still not just cosmetic either.
---
I use to buy plans, but I bought them all. So I buy ammo, or give caps to friends. Sometimes I buy over priced stuff from low levels. Then I open my shop back up. And do it all over again in about 8 hours.
---
Child Killer used to be a perk (sorta)
---
1 day NW event where everyone is wearing huge turkey costumes. üòÇ
---
And it's not like they are just hording the money spent on atoms either. A good portion of that goes back into the game for development. If the game isn't making money, then they'll just stop patching and updating. It's not like they can force the developers to work for free.
---
‚òùÔ∏è this
---
it must be the Haters duping weapons to bring the servers down.  If it wasn't for the Haters logging on the server population would be nil
---
People ask for it, they listened.
---
I'm happy because I started the free weekend NW came out so it's the only intro I've ever seen.
---
Bethesda migrated all the servers to Stadia.
---
The mannequins that all stand around around an object or whatever as a random encounter?
---
IIRC you can find a note in a container that spawns near them occasionally. I've only found it once since beta, that explains that they're a memorial to the people who died when the bombs fell. Presumably by survivors....
---
Asylum Worker Uniform + Asylum Worker Hat+ Prisoner Collar.
---
They won't, they are all in on games as a service. They are trying to figure out how to have paid mods in their store, along with all the current store MMO style offerings. Each game since 3 has had RPG elements removed from the game. No more skill checks. Dialog is the Bioware 4 choices that don't really matter or line up with what you are actually saying or doing. 
---
Fallout was my favorite as a kid. I grew up playing the first two. Bethesda used to be one of my favorite studios and/or publishers. They just don't care about anything other than making money, they've gone the way of EA. And it's incredibly disappointing.
---
First off let me say that I used to be bloodied and I switched to junkies because the vault raids.
---
Bloodied is a overkill, I can still one shot everything using a shotgun.
---
Bloodied also have other downsides apart from the obvious low health, specially if you are going to do raids: you have to spend a lot of perks to make it viable, you are limited to unyielding/bolstering armor, you need to always be avoiding rad damage (nuke mines can kill you) and in raids your teammates can't equip rad sponge because of you, they also are going to expend a lot of stimpacks picking you up, those crickets are no joke.
---
The only downside of Junkies is that you have to constantly get chems to negate the effects of addictions, other than that I like it way more than bloodied.
---
PS4 player here. For about a week I'm having a bug where when I first load into the game or if I fast travel, whatever weapon I have equipped will say it's out of ammo, even though I have tons of ammo for that weapon. Switching weapons and then switching back is the only way to fix it. VATS has been spotty lately too, especially with the Tesla.
---
Hey now! Barbie and Ken's action dreamhouse is part of the end-game! I mean I have 19 Thematically created camps crossing 5 accounts!
---
I always go in through the back door no problem but I went in the front door earlier and it froze during the loading screen.
---
Stealth boy
---
Vendor caps and scrip and iirc dailies are 20hr timer
---
I would GUESS it does stack, but it's not needed. Get you AGI above 30 and use 3* sneak, and escape artist. I run a UNL/Sneak build and I can sneak up to a level 92 death claw and stay undetected. Of course, as soon as you do damage others will move toward you, just sneak to another location.
---
Nah, was still there this morning on PC.
---
Not pimping Fo1st but I'm surprised they didn't offer larger budget and camp radius with the subscription.  That would be the only reason I would likely buy it. I suppose they couldn't let you transfer your camp to public servers though.
---
Thanks :)
---
Although you can earn atoms relatively easily (I earned over 7000 since launch) I will agree that 1800 for a paint job is ridiculous and I refuse to buy them even though I want to had have my "free" atoms.  I rather wait for something small to go on sale and pick up random 50 - 200 atoms items.
---
I did splurge and get the scrap protection though....
---
The problem is there's no unyielding power armor parts, and we can't pocket the pieces. üòû
---
That's why I hold on to my Atoms until there is a sale and/or the item is leaving the vault. I generally have enough for everything I want doing just the daily and weekly objectives.
---
Can you file a support ticket for me here so we can take a closer look?  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
I have more than 50 legendary revolvers. A quad feels like your cup of tea. Forget that black powder pistol.
---
That‚Äôs my plan. Using a full UNy +1 str heavy combat set. So that‚Äôs 15 AGI from armor alone. I think I have like 10-13 points in agility though. Will have to check. Rn I‚Äôm buying UNY +1 Str sneak armor to test/use
---
Well that‚Äôs a step in the right direction haha
---
Submit a ticket, that shit affects everyone man. For now, log into adventure and back out before playing NW for the day

---
This is still on our list for an upcoming update, I don't have an ETA right now, unfortunately.
---
Because fortnite can charge $20 dollars for a skin that doesn't even have the cool liberty prime voices and people still buy it. Comparatively speaking, the atom shop is actually fairly cheap compared to some other games.
---
I go 2 into each weapon card. Leaves room for 3 in incisor, martial artist, and either barbarian or blocker. 
---
Are you just going full mellee tank?  Because there is a lot to be said for the pretty massive damage bonuses to sneaking.
---
Well yeah.
---
Ppl praise what they like. Its not rocket science.  I
---
Compared to Fortnite prices, it's actually fairly cheap. For a whole legendary set, you can drop damn near 40 dollars in v bucks if you want the whole set.
---
As one of those people who actually has done modding since FO3, I know first hand how absurdly complicated  something incredibly small can be sometimes.
---
Exactly, it's not needed to beat the game. It doesn't give you any advantage over other players. The item is purely cosmetic. Those who want it badly enough will buy it.
---
There's a -50 carry weight "hangover debuff" on the lager that lasts for like 2 min, I haven't seen anything like that with the steaks tho
---
Not horrible, but it did get old fast.
---
Cooking those glowing steaks would be certainly faster.
---
The constant queries to see if a player is a Fallout 1st Subscriber to determine if they get a secret bonus chance on loot drops taxes the servers.
---
It's in that area where it can really be either depending on what type of eye you have. 
---
Some people's eyes arn't as developed on the color spectrum so they can't differentiate shades as easily. 
---
I honestly see both green and grey at the same time.
---
Can't recall it had any benefits though. Didn't it make pretty much everyone hostile?
---
I keep running across the same bugs. My friends have told me I have way too much patience with fo76. I have given it a solid chance, which is honestly an understatement.
---
The last time I played fo76, I logged in and immediately could not move. I could use VATS, I could bring up the map and fast travel, but that's it.
---
Master has integrated with technology now and is starting his experiments.
---
no. you would need a monitor (not a television) to gain any improvement in FPS.
---
I do think 1800 for this one skin is a bit high, when I think the original bundle of the two liberty primes skins was 1800.  
---
Some PA skins are what 800?
---
I think it might be time to have my vision checked again honestly.
---
We used to praise the sun for raising every morning.
---
Prefrontal cortex too small, adrenal glands too large, what can one do?
---
Yes, but fortnite is free
---
See I took that differently.  I took it as MODUS murdered everyone in the bunker (including loyal enclave members) in retaliation for the attack not in self defense.  Regardless MODUS is still malfunctioning and homicidal.  I also think that psychopath Eckhart hid his consciousness inside MODUS before he died.  I have no proof of that other than how badly MODUS wants you to use Nukes and the creepy smiley face MODUS gets when its talking to you but it's my theory.
---
Read the first 500 pages 
---
https://steamcommunity.com/app/377160/eventcomments/1634166237653215768
---
Or... Pick any random page to get an idea what everyone's opinion is. It used to be called Creation club points, now its called atoms.
---
Yea. I'm a 1st member because for me its a great deal. I do a lot of "farming" &amp; buying/selling &amp; I'm a huge base builder so I do tend to do my best to earn Atoms and/or buy some from time to time. The 1st membership works well for a gamer like me. I get why people care mad about it as well but it seems to be doing really well as over half the camp vendors I join are 1st members as well.
---
Now all they gotta do is revert the Atomic Shop theme from the raider one.
---
My friend was going through something and found multiple colors of the same grey wallpaper
---
It was a poor example or just poor word usage, but bugs that have been in the game like the 250 DR while reloading negating the legendary prefix or crashing while eating or drinking should have been fixed by now, not a lightbulb or stash box color...
---
Just wood and grey, because no other colors were in stock. üòÇ
---
Maybe that's what it was - I can't keep track anymore!
---
This, NW one was horrible, worst we get so far. I'm glad for changing it back to default.
---
Level 350 odd here. I've earned around 5000 in just over two months Just doing daily and weekly (not even all of them). It's not hard if you try but you have to a fully check them. At lower levels you earn them just doing anything. Repair a rifle? 10 atoms! Scrap armour? 10 atoms!
---
/r/unexpectedHitchens
---
Just had to look it up actually 
---
It's a -30% initial social reaction from both good and evil characters and an increased chance to meet bounty hunters in overworld random encounters 
---
And as a bonus it has the single most fucked up icon there is as it is Vault Boy kicking a pregnant woman in the stomach.
---
Yup - The bar is seriously that low. And expect to get voted down over and over for even asking the question.
---
There's actually a few reasonably well-hidden mysteries in the game but, like most things in Fallout 76, they're underdeveloped and feel like something Wastelanders might expand on. 
---
One example is a couple of small sheds near the starting area of the game where you can hear ground-shaking ghostly screams. It's never really made clear what the hell is going on there, but it certainly stands out. 
---
Another lesser known example is some borderline Lovecraftian life form hidden somewhere in the NE side of the map. I forget the exact location, but you should be able to look it up. Basically it's some seriously occult shit in a dungeon and a very well-hidden room with a pulsating tentacle thing inside. No real explanation given, other than the strong implication of some Lovecraftian cahoots. 
---
I'm sure you can find more as well. The game world is just so large that there's really a lot of stuff that's easy to miss.
---
I can definitely say that the last patch butchered my frames. Now I average 35-40. Before this patch I was doing between 2-3 times that.
---
Whatever they did, the game is borderline unplayable now :|
---
Hi! Will this also include the raider chest?
---
Does it really bother you that bad? In a sea of predatory business practices from gaming companies (looking at you Treyarch, EA, Activision), BGS/ZoS really isn't as bad as everyone makes them out to be. They're in this to make money, just like everyone else. Atleast they don't hide the best equipment inside loot boxes.
---
I did so too, loved the image though. XD
---
We need to have this back in the age of snowflakes.
---
He does appear in the most unexpected places ;)
---
Then don't buy it. It's not needed in anyway for the game.
---
Bug still:
---
250DR
---
Energy weapons making your target immortal
---
Probably more old bugs that they don't care about.
---
Other players can not steal items from your footlockers.
---
T-51b for day to day, T-60 for nuke zones. I still bust out my T-45d pretty regularly just 'cuz I like it.
---
Are you overencumbered?
---
Did you pick up boatfly gland. Forgot to mention it too. But boatfly gland only bring 50 acids. I did it last might 3 times and got around 410. Number do vary from run to run depending on certain factor and its normal that they stop spawning. When they do, i fast travel out and restart the process. Made 1200 acid in an hour
---
Haven't bought either and I'm doing just fine. I only save pre-war food for consumption and let all other food spoil for fertilizer. And it's not like the collector is giving you thousands caps worth of scrap everyday.
---
you don't have to wear the outfit the whole time.  just put it on right before you pop
---
This is just something you are going to have to accept i am afraid - you are doing nothing wrong - it's just the game - been like this for a year now.
---
EI Hey weeee Eee is 
---
Ppl ah aw aqqww is z
---
Hieee
---
Cause that was the same price as the original Liberty Prime PA skins? Granted, the original was a bundle that came with 2 skins (regular + patriot prime) but still. This ain't just your ordinary PA paint. This comes with voice lines and such that make it completely unique compared to any of the other skins
---
there is stuff for the holiday event we have that we're still piecing together but its not everything, so there will def be one more patch
---
Oh that has nothing to do with eye sight clarity. 
---
Inside everybody's eyes there are little cones that pick up light. The more cones you have the better you are able to differentiate between different color shades. Essentially you see more colors. 
---
This is why some people only wear black and paint their house beige. They just don't really care for color because that isnt how their eyes/brains developed. 
---
That would drive me crazy. But then again, my brain hates the lack of color so much that it mentally colors in black and white images. 
---
Honestly, seeing green probably means that your eyes are slightly better in that regard
---
Yeah, I server hop certain creature spawns like tics.
---
I'll pay $40 for the kitchen bundle.
---
they don't "give" anything away,if they made tasks simpler you could say they gave away atoms but they do not. the daily free atoms are usually a pain in the butt having to run all over the map costing more caps than gaining atoms. if they kept it all in one region kept tasks quick then u could say give away
---
Its like someone who is forced to eat glass in their food every day.  Except one day, instead of glass its human feces.  The people who were forced to eat the glass now consider the feces to be a gift from the heavens.
---
Feels like some Mirelurk Kings in the Wendigo Cave do poison and bleed dmg at the same time, making your health bar skydive, it's ridiculous.
---
My workaround: P.A.W. (Power Armor Wall), lure the MKs in a narrow passage, place  2-3 PAs and swing your sledge through the openings. Yea, it's an exploit but it's also almost necessary.
---
That‚Äôs awesome :) I think i‚Äôm going to go down the Junkies path. Thanks :)
---
They should focus on fixing bugs and improving stability
---
I saw this dude named NoobKiller on PC.  this dude was wrecking face and all legit (watched after I died).
---
They did, however they‚Äôre waiting to release it so you have to buy multiple subscriptions.
---
If you‚Äôve ever gone up into the attic and found that really cool t-shirt you thought had been lost forever, then you know what people are asking for here.  Newer is not always better, it‚Äôs just different.  And sometimes nothing feels as good as that old, work cotton.
---
Boooooooo!!
---
People always complain about "level up 0/3" and i don't really understand why.  It is extremely easy to do.   Much easier than taking a camera picture of a player naked in a nuke zone like we used to get.
---
no, it should be slashed 25% if not more.
---
i like many things about this. NoobKiller, interesting. wrecking face is funny too.
---
Im a heavy weapon build, and i bring a melee in there and no problem. Ghoulish and rad sponge prevents me from dying. Also i just switch my heavy gun perk to melee perk, but my friend who dont have melee perk just use melee without those perk and does really good with it.
---
Yeah there seems to be a large damage decrease. I may try it! The problem is finding the weapons, a Junkies Explosive Handmade would be so rare to find. Cheers :)
---
The shrieking girl in the cabins is a holotape in the terminal. Lovecraftian thing is also interesting
---
I mean... they make everything out of human bones, so...
---
once again in a language similar to my own?
---
Oh ok, Sounds good :)
---
Have you tried doing a full shutdown  on your Xbox? After patching, this tends to alleviate a lot of problems for me.
---
The original theme fits the feel of the game. The original theme and visuals not only carries with it positive nostalgia for those of us that enjoyed this game when it first came out, but the immersion that comes with playing a game set in the same season as the one going on outside
---
?
---
I did the vault a looot of time last time it was around, made around 400k round of ammo from all that acid. No joke
---
Now we need a soft Christmas song theme in back ground like really soft
---
What turkey costume?
---
Oh ok, i haven‚Äôt tried a Vault Raid, but most likely will soon. Cheers man :)
---
Plus you lose strength bonuses and go weak and flaccid. Power armor parts should all be +1 strength. A girl wearing the ratty skirt hits harder than a power armored dude with a Sledge.
---
underground radrats in the server room
---
Yeah I did, 310 risk in one run which is still great. I will keep practicing. Thanks!
---
Gourmand rollplay?
---
It‚Äôs nostalgic for those of us from the BETA days
---
Agreed... my response to my mate talking about getting it was "but it's like ¬£18?". More like ¬£14/15, but still... for a skin?!
---
You have to pick the card. 10 red cards, go to the overseer/council room, vote to reduce threat lvl and then after voting you will be able to choose to unlock the engineering section
---
No problem

Can you imagine the modern day outcry to the intro movie in FO1 where the US soldiers are executing Canadian citizens while happily waving at the camera?
---
Why?
---
Interesting, i really want to try it now! I‚Äôm getting a bit tired if bloodied because i feel like the whole point of levelling up is to become stronger, but that doesn‚Äôt happen with bloodied and you can nearly die to things like ticks, which high levels shouldn‚Äôt. Thank you :)
---
why thank you kindly.  good hunting out there!
---
agreed, also this map that has been floating around of potential new sites for NW, there not going to get rid. Harpers Ferry, a smaller interesting looking map at Charleston along with the 2 already morgantown and flat woods. Adv mode players and fo4 RPG players are allowed to not like it but just stay away from the game mode and all reddit posts related. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
The ghosts screaming could mean that there is a mass grave. We have saw that before in the Fallout universe, at the Little Yantze, during OWB, in New Vegas.
---
I'm curious... why do you feel camp budget should be cut?  Server stability?  Or something else?
---
I swear, I think they do this shit so people whine about it and take the heat off of actual major bugs in the game. How often are people in the main menu to have such an issue with the NW theme, or the fucking ranger coat. Omfg my game occasionally crashes when I eat or drink and I have to crouch and reload to keep my legendary prefix and this challenge says I still haven't killed the SBQ. But this fucking scrap box I look at all of 10 seconds a day is ugly, idk... smh
---
Yeah i hate that one too, but remember we dont complete it. We simply enter, unlock the engineering, and then as soon as were done with the cricket, we ft out. We dont do anything else.
---
would be dope if we could get blessing of Mara
---
This. There's a small, vocal minority that is heated over the 1st thing, but the majority of the player base is thrilled with the subscription. I've seen people, myself included, asking for a subscription similar to ESO for a while. We finally got it. Hell, I have friends that came back BECAUSE of the subscription, not in spite of it. I hope all these angry people find peace soon, because frankly I'm tired of seeing it.
---
You aren't going to get for free what others are willing to pay for. That's not how capitalism works, that's not how companies make money to keep development going and pay their bills.
---
Get over it! üòÅ
---
PS If you think BGS is really doing such a terrible thing with Fallout 1st, go play MW, or CoD, Anthem... as far as bad business practices go BGS/ZoS is definitely on the conservative side of that spectrum.
---
Mine says you can level up above lvl 76, while wearing a Responders outfit and a fasnaught hat. And it repeats... all the time. Asylum outfit with sunglasses above 76, naked/above 76/diseased. I just go to my stash, put on the outfit it needs and get my caps. Im 200 and I get them everyday. [https://imgur.com/Rff87sW](https://imgur.com/Rff87sW)
---
It stacks and it makes a huge difference. Compare what you can do with any combat armor plus rifle vs stand fast plus fixer. Big difference.
---
If anybody is on psn, send me a pm, and wel go do the vault raid together
---
Meant to say OR. Edited.
---
I have a +250 damage resistance weapon, what is the bug?
---
That's actually not a terrible idea. u/Ladydevann
---
Some of the notes look like freddy's handwriting from that 1 quest at the water park
---
It's the only bug I like. The backpack and sleeping bag look awesome, realistic and unique with the right outfit.
---
There will likely never be any game without glitches, each engine has its own unique weird shit... Easiest option for dealing with this is also the same since Skyrim. 
---
Use an Area of Effect attack, explosives work well. Damage will still apply through the floor and you can complete the quest.
---
I am so sorry ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
This bug is absolutely BS and I hate it, but if you wait for the event monster to despawn, you'll be able to respawn afterwords and then you'll get the event completion rewards so it's not a total loss.
---
English is my third language, when you have to argue with something totally unrelated to my point, you make yourself look stupid.
---
thanks for leaving the other crickets.  your a good person.
---
You need to fast travel away and come back when you have the quest to retake it. If it still doesnt work, well, you're fucked.
---
how much that weights?
---
If you know approximately where it's at, nuka grenades always work for me :) the blast radius extends underground.
---
I sincerely hope you're right.  I'd love it if they learned something from all this.  I'm not holding my breath, but I really really hope you are right.
---
My pal ran through V94 with full sneak set; the mooks didn't notice him most of the time. I woud guess it stacks and breaks the game.
---
West tek was awesome, one of my fav locales. 
---
UNLOCK THE INVESTIGATORS TERMINAL BETHESDA.
---
All of a character stach and inventory. I sent it to a mule that sold ammo. People were surprised to see a lvl 20 selling 200k round of ammo, that had on his inventory another 200k
---
It's not about the players still playing the game who have 1st, it is about the players who don't play anymore either because they are pissed about the subscription or because there is no endgame content. Nobody besides Bethesda can tell how many people are in either group. "Worlds are full" is hardly an argument. If there were only 24 players in total at any given time, they would still be playing on a full server. 
---
I support OPs proposal and would even add a possibility for trading caps into atoms (maybe at a 10:1 ratio?) so folks in the endgame have a reason to farm and grind caps.
---
I want to go pickman on their asses.
---
I'm a huge fan of base building, however I'm not a 1st member, but that $16 worth of atoms per month seems appealing when you only pay $13 or even $7 with the yearly, big saving! 1600 atoms will easily cover any bundle releasing in the future.
---
So what. You would rather they bring in loot boxes, with a chance to get the best legendary weapons, armor and PA for money instead? Cosmetics are optional.
---
Apparently you want it bad enough to be angry over the price ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
he he hey man got any spare caps for Dru..food.
---
When you reload it negates the primary legendary effect of the weapon. Crouching while reloading will usually avoid the issue.
---
A lot of people including myself, have lost legendary items usually armor, on 4 occasions for me. At first I thought maybe I scripted it but I lost another one, and another one that IK was in my stash for probably the last 3 months cause I was working on a set and it just vanished. I had 4/5 peices to a set and I gave up cause I lost the chest peice leaving me with 3/5. It was a Vanguards rad resistance WWR marine chest. The other ones I lost were Assassins Ap refresh Cavaliers marine chest and a chameleon harder to detect heavy metal LA. The 4th one I don‚Äôt remember except it was Assassins Marine.
---
I'd like this idea if it was not as huge as a silo nuke, and if I had a little bit of time to run or get into power armor/a hazmat suit. Just instantly exploding would suck.
---
Id really hoped we got a quest with him and the miss nanny in wastelanders, you know have them all re-unite, but we don't know what vault he went into do we?
---
It's likely this. Giving the illusion of "listening to the community" I'd guess. And there's folks who are going to bitch about the cosmetic stuff while their game crashes etc
---
Atom gains not bad. Like 500ish a week so you save up a bit if you don‚Äôt blow it every week on the new item.
---
You also know that most things come back around. Like the 4 horsemen pa. It came back around. Nuka Girl costume, it came back around. The atom shop revolves, if you miss something... its gonna come back around. Just hold onto your atoms and wait. Just like the garden bundle, that I bought when it came out an last week it was back for a few days.
---
There is no way to farm them, the few places they spawn have a 1 in 100 chance and furthermore you still have to pick a random wire that leads to it detonating instead of becoming a dud.
---
Not to mention that all this stuff people are purchasing in the Atomic Shop will be lost forever whenever Bethesda decides to shut down the servers someday.
---
value is relative
---
but sadly it makes my red nurse outfit look... well not good...
---
Exactly. Fallout 76 is not. It's way cheaper now than the $60+ it was at launch, but it's still not free.
---
The reason why it is priced this way is that the community as a whole are willing to pay the prices set by Bethesda.  I'm sure on an individual level there are many not willing to pay these prices, but these items are not targeted for you.
---
Why would anyone or any business sell anything for less than what the market is willing to bear?
---
Shrek master h4x0rz
---
Yep its happened to me.
---
60 days doing most of daily &amp; weeklies to buy 2.6 skins, i suppose its not hard, maybe slave labor working at 80 cents per day, i dunno i never played this game. Don't even understand who how many whales buy this stuff.
---
I like things the way they are regarding building limits. Building should remain part of the game, like some other elements. It can't be the main thing. There are other games for that. 
---
I visit camps every day and some people are building gigantic buildings with crops, turrets, pianos, vending machines, Brahmin and sculptures, displayers and guest rooms.
---
Fallout 76 sucked so bad that I went back and played a modded Fallout 4 and it's a masterpiece compared to FO76.

I believe the weightless aspect only increases sneak due to how stealth interacts with armor weight. The lighter it is, the sneakier you are intrinsically.
---
True, but thats only because they forgot to change PA STR from 11 in FO4 (1 Above base max) to 16 in FO76
---
With the exception of Unyeilding bonuses, any other STR bonus you get, gets applied in PA (IIRC)
---
I think $18 is outrageous for a skin of any sort.  Crazy how much more it cost for PA users than outfit users.
---
That being said, 1800 atoms is a lot more affordable.  They throw atoms at you in this game and weekly/ dailies always make sure I have a bank to spend when i need it.  
---
I dont think you need to buy every 1800 atom PA out there.  The game gives you more than enough atoms to buy a couple of these and still have leftover to buy some odds and ends.
---
I think I must have scripped it because I am still wearing a full set of legendary armor. None of them are chameleon anymore and all are Max level scout (previously my ch√°pale on was only 40)
---
Ah....
---
It's a glitch caused from being Well Fed. Being Well Fed increases your Max HP and using Radaway increases your hunger. If you use Radaway at low HP and the result causes your hunger to drop below 'Well Fed' levels, your HP disappears from the bottom end of your Health Bar (cause amazing coding) and that results in your death. It took me way too long to figure this out. It's also the reason you randomly lose health from time to time. It's your HP dropping due to the Well Fed bonus ending. The solution? Don't eat food. Ever. For any reason. Or you will die.
---
You could get this by grinding in game without spending a dollar.
---
Not sure it's a "Glitch", but a basically correlation of effects, but otherwise correct.
---
I own
---
I didn't mind the shop at first. I play on PC and came from a game where I paid a monthly sub I didn't mind forking up $15 a month for atoms. I thought the Atom shop was cool because the prices were cheap considering how many atoms I got while I was leveling through the main and side quests.
---
I stopped leveling, I finished the quests. I got the robot, I got the fridge, I got 1st to get more atoms for the Halloween package and **I didn't mind it.**  
---
But then I hit a point in the game where events and dailies were the only think to do. The core of the game became farming for legendaries and atoms **which is the literal concept of mobile games.** The store kept getting weekly updates but the game itself remained the same unfinished, unpolished, sloppy, boring, slow, repetitive game where you couldn't even do a Halloween event without it shitting out on you.
---
Shop items could have made great content rewards but they don't seem to care about content. When a game comes out with more content in the shop than in the game then its time for a new game.
---
**TL;DR**
---
I  wouldn't mind the shop if they used the money they're getting from it to improve the game, but as far as I can tell they don't give two shits about it.
---
Semantics
---
Weren't the other two liberty prime paints cheaper and came in a bundle together? Am I recollecting incorrectly? These prices are bizarre and really want to know how they value their items. Prices seem so inconsistent too... like one hat's cost might be more or less than another hat's cost. Same for other clothing, under-armor, etc.
---
Yes, you could in fact grind for 30 hours to get a cosmetic,[you could do that...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2weNM4JtME)
---
There is a line though. Too easy and you're essentially giving your customers free money. You pay with time invested in game, your actual wallet, or both.
---
Dude, you never show your armor, you stay far back, mostly behind, and cut the video off at the part where things get interesting.
---
Make sure your well fed bonus don't make your hp drop at 0 because being low life and well fed and using radaway  the game will remove your life ( literally ) and not your maximum hit point once you lose well fed ( especially more dangerous with the improved well fed perk card, it's a very badly done mechanic to me, making life boost food/chems relatively dangerous ( it's a old issue too tho, and not only in f76 )
---
The perk card removing the effect of chems on food and drink might help greatly.
---
I think your best solution would be to just try out different weapons and perks until you find something you really like. I do the best with heavy guns and heavy gun perks. I also learned to move around when a gun fight ensues. Move side to side or jump while shooting. Staying in one spot makes it a lot easier for them to kill you.
---
No challenges that are for the Savage Divide work within Whitespring for some reason. Back when we had the 1,302,028 daily photo challenges, you couldn't photo the squirrels or rabbits in there to count for savage divide photos. WS is tagged as being in the SD but I can't figure out why the challenges don't work there.
---
Agreed, I shouldn't have to restart my game half a dozen times per play session because I'm constantly getting the damage bug for daring to use my favorite Tesla too much.  Or having to restart when I have no trade option when trying to trade items with another player.  Or having to restart because I died at the end of a public event and it won't let me respawn at all.
---
I love this game but it's honestly really fucking irritating that these game breaking bugs have lingered for so long.
---
This is true
---
Do it for the sense of accomplishment.
---
What do you think is a reasonable amount or atoms or time to grind for something like this in game?
---
I've grinded a lot longer in other games for free stuff.
---
I really like sniping in this mode. This map is great for it also.
---
I can't afford $18. power armor paint that I can use on all characters. I need that money to spend $25-$30 on my world of warcraft mount and pet collection from their store. WTH was Bethesda thinking. Come to think of it... its also dipping into my ESO and Creation Club cash. Nope. Not gonna buy it. Oh and im level 221, I earn all daily and weekly atoms. By myself. 180 atoms this week. 60 daily atoms. If its something I want, really want, I do a regular challenge for the 40 or 80 atoms.
---
Because the pvp'ers have been spoiled with free game after free game, so its harder to appease you guys with shiny stuff when you expect to grind it out instead of just buy it.
---
When you grind for your atoms like I do, you would never just frivolously spend 1800 of them on a paint job.
---
They need to be cutting these prices drastically if they want people to spend their hoarded atoms if they hope for us to buy more from the shop.
---
**Woosh**
---
Wait, so Stealthboys just tosses all your sneak stats from perks and gear out the window and uses a weak version roughly equal to 2 in sneak and adds a transparency overlay to your model? It doesn't enhance what you have???
---
Yeah, those are where my problems lie. I have a quad auto tesla rifle that I was super hyped to find, it was probably the best weapon I had when I first found it. But I couldn't ever use it because after 5-10 minutes it consistently triggered the damage bug. Then I found a junkie's tesla rifle and made that semi-auto, because then surely it won't trigger the bug. I ended up getting it 3 times in a row using that for the vault raids, and that's when I stopped playing. Sad to see that so many months later this game breaking issue still isn't being addressed
---
They did I believe.
---
It's coming soon.
---
Hopefully as part of the base subscription and not another add on or something ridiculous.
---
The fLoAtiNg sHrUbS was much needed, not sure what you're complaining about. /s
---
What are you grinding them for then if you aren't going to spend them?
---
That works for me all the time
---
Something with "SunupdateThreshold" I think, currently not at desk to look into files
---
Yea that was a big push for me. I enjoy the private server &amp; exclusive content but the 1650 Atoms is what really sold me. I saved a lot by getting the yearly membership.
---
Sorry that you are bothered by what others like.
---
Yeah, this game has really been lacking on post-launch quests/story telling DLC. I seriously hope that ramps up after hopefully a successful Wastelanders launch.
---
I think it's in tables with the mothman and west Virginia tables keep going right.
---
The game either has to be better optimized to help out the PS4 with FPS or we need the PS5 to hurry up and come out lol 
---
Bethesda did not optimize the game for consoles properly and even high end pcs have some issues. 
---
Also if you look at the ps4 specs they‚Äôre pretty bad and out dated now a days.
---
We just have to bare with it and hope they do some optimizations.
---
To be honest, I‚Äôd much rather crappier graphics and lower reso‚Äôs / textures if it meant a steady 60 fps.
---
Also the engine this game runs on is pretty outdated and did not age well.
---
But.... They aren't being rewarded in actual currency..... They are being rewarded in 1s and 0s. Don't give video game producers more credit than they deserve. They ain't giving free money out with free Atoms, they are giving away an arbitrary currency that costs them absolutely nothing to produce.
---
Sounds to me like you have too much free time if you're willing to grind that long for one item skin...
---
Fortnite is also free to play....
---
Red asylum outfit, clean skiing hat, black rim glasses, and a prisoner collar. Sometimes might swap out for one of the other asylum outfits. It took me long enough to get them all, so I might as well actually wear them
---
I kept trying to get an answer, the best one apart from "the NW one sucked" was that it got old from so much server hopping. I can't imagine what their actual in game experience is like with all these bugs that aren't getting fixed in leiu of scrap box color changes and ranger armor skirt modifications...
---
that's a legendary set that i assume adds to your character. this is just paint that literally adds nothing but wow factor to your character
---
Hey man, I wanted to thank you again for the invite yesterday. Great group of guys you have and sincerely appreciate the help.
---
His point is he's not dropping 1800 atoms on a paint because the effort is just not worth that reward.
---
I love the game but I admit the main reason I still play so much is the building aspect. Its not my only reason, I do very much enjoy everything but I love to build &amp; design. I honestly think it'd be cool in the future if they added another mode just for building/creation. (Adventure/Nuclear Winter/Creation)
---
&gt; At current prices I only will get one thing at a time and only if it seems essential to one of my characters roleplay. 
---
Sorry but piggybacking your words, but can even cosmetic items in this game be considered not pay to win when a majority of the playerbase roleplay in the same manner you do? When victory or success is achieved not because of what you killed? But because you got something you think is going to make you look badass?
---
Thanks.
---
Not a problem man. Feel free to come back anytime
---
I'm not justifying the practice.  I think this microtransactions thing has made pretty much every game they are in a shitshow.  
---
Any way I say this is going to sound like I'm supporting the dev but let's all not pretend like we would go to work for free because we just want "a sense of pride and accomplishment"
---
Not a problem. Feel free to join in anytime
---
I have not checked recently but those linings were 'broken'.
---
As in 'they had no effect'.
---
That's subjective though right?
---
Nah, let me enjoy it how I want to.
---
How many hours of gameplay does this require?
---
If your goal is frivolous spending then yeah the prices need to be dropped. I've saved up over 3.5k atoms from casual play since the BETA and still have been able to pick up a few suits of Power Armor paints and weapon skins that suit my character's theme
---
Nope. I'd rather pay for it or not buy it at all.
---
\[YAY\]
---
Fallout 1st subscriber and I think they should make the scrapbox available to all as it was promised Pre-Launch that Scrap would not take up stash space.
---
Yeah and a recolored skin isn't worth 18$. Lol
---
Or exiting and restarting the game just to add friends on PC.  For a multiplayer game, that should be a basic requirement that has to work!
---
Or just play the game, like, once or twice a week for a few months and complete the daily/achievement atom challenges
---
Fluoride in the water.
---
I know what they said, that ship sailed when the community at large was licking their boots over repair kits.
---
I will take the scrapbox over more movement towards more game affecting things like those kits.
---
Fallout 1st was introduced for no other reason than to make money for the game, just that simple. So making it something that people can acquire without buying it doesn't make any sense as they wouldn't make money on something they made just to make money.
---
I server hop a lot, there's still tons of players playing, for some reason people on reddit think that the whole world's players are on this site, they aren't.
---
As far as caps to atoms, I agree that could be a good idea, but caps are so liquid that you would almost have to have a 100:1 ratio, there again tho, the atom shop is based around making money to continue to fund the game. So making it easier to acquire what it has to offer without paying doesn't make sense.
---
mainly server stability. i think, but not totally sure yet, that camp items take the longest to render of all items in the game.
---
large camp budgets are simply in place so Bethesda can sell more crap from the Atom store.  we can‚Äôt have larger stashes (ie. arbitrary number), yet servers can handle rending wasteland mansions for 24 people? lol OK
---
large camp budgets work against players any way you slice it.
---
I dont get why we have the constant complaining about the atomic shop prices. I'm not saying the prices aren't high, because they obviously are but if you actively farmed atoms for a couple of weeks(just daily's and weekly's) you could easily have close to 800atoms. In a month you could be very close to having the atoms to get the skin for free(apart from the time and caps you have put in to farm the atoms)  
---
I am lvl345 I have been farming the atom challenges for so long that most of them aren't even a challenge anymore. I know where certain flowers grow, where specific enemies have a greater chance of spawning. It can be a grind at times server hopping to kill 5 rad scorpions in the savage divide(or challenges of that ilk) but so is wandering around whitespring or west tek to find legendaries. 
---
I think you complain because you want it now and for almost free because you spent all your atoms on another item that you wanted straight away then.
---
Cheers guys had a suspicion it was that as I stopped taking the endurance/HP increasing chems as they kill you when they wear off. Will just have to try and not lose the well fed bonus and take a radaway too soon after
---
Maybe I missed it in your Armor &amp; Underarmor post but just in case it's not there:
---
Enclave underarmor still\* clips through the Hunter's Long Coat and the Imposter Sheepsquatch outfit. (\*haven't checked lately)
---
Honestly i'm still hoping we will eventually be able to set up clutter/junk as static items. Also really hoping for that Garden set. Could either add a greenhouse onto my home or make it a nice sun room to lounge in while my pastries are in the oven.
---
I use a mixture of long range, automatics, and explosives and I typically play solo. Long range for the person in the distance that has no clue I'm  in a bush. The automatic for up close battles and explosives for crowd control. I also have poor reaction time and found this to be helpful.
---
I have an answer for you. Because players time and time and time again prove to Bethesda that they will pay and gobble up EVERYTHING bethesda launches. No matter how rediculous products and services they promote. Everyone paying a single cent to Bethesda after fallout 1st is to blame for this. Coorperate sees numbers, that is how it works. It isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúwoops, we pressed 18 instead of 2 dollars‚Äù.
---
So stop. Buying. Shit.
---
There are also other colorswaps of that style coming out including a nice dark green one which could look nice with wooden floors for a billiards room.
---
I don't plan on paying for any of the overpriced nonsense they keep adding. I've given Bethesda more than enough money over the years, so I really don't feel bad about it either. If they make prices reasonable, and start adding some real meat to the game, I may reconsider, but not atm. Thanks for proving one of the many points I make in these subreddits though. There will always be the apologists, defenders, excuse makers, and the "don't buy its" making weak arguments for the bullshit Bethesda is pulling. If you want to get a real idea of the state of this game, check out Fallout 76 on google trends. It's been all down hill since the start, and the closest the game has come to trending since it's launch was when people started calling them out on this wannabe EA/Activision shit. You do realize you saying "then don't buy it" is like sitting in a burning house saying "it's not burning down". It's a problem, and ignoring it does absolutely nothing to fix it.
---
We do still have the completely unsolved and spooky mystery of the fact that everybody at the Palace of the Winding Path just straight up vanished without a trace overnight.
---
a line they do not look to adjust, they throw anything at us and just expect us to be grateful for the crumbs we get meanwhile you get more free content from actual completed games who respond if you have legit gaming errors and want to make sure their community is happy. Bethesda lost that. i am a true beliver in the franchise and i make things worse by choosing  fallout 1st but i slso believe the more money we put in the better they make the game but they continue to prove me wrongn
---
I‚Äôm a 1st subscriber, I have the scrap box. 
---
It renders the game more playable.
---
My understanding is that weighted doesnt stack, so maybe try one of each? I use one weighted and one aerodynamic and it seems to work pretty well.
---
I like to think those who can afford it, keep the game alive. It‚Äôs these monetary contribution that they show to investors. I personally enjoy crafting power armor. I carry over 60 sets and maybe one day I‚Äôll be able to store them.
---
it depends. I have not timed it, but can get a character to 50 in a week to 10 days of play. So maybe 30 to 40 hours?
---
that is if you are doing the quests and story lines too. If you just go grind exp, you could likely to it in 15 to 20 hours. Double EXP weekend and some exp buffs that stack (Sleep, mothman, canned soup/cranberry cobbler) cut that down even further.
---
Ballpark, probably 100.  I'm sure there's somebody on here who can tell you they can speedlevel someone to 50 with their 3 buddies helping them in 30, but in reality, for the people following the quests, reading the letters, listening to tapes, hacking computers to get the backstory, and actually, you know, playing the game, getting to 50 is no small task.
---
*yawn*
---
This is what, the millionth time this has been brought up?  Have we run out of actual issues to complain about, and now we're cycling back over from the beginning again?
---
Except the relationships you build with other people and whatever you do with your camp.
---
Every mmorpg is like this. We technically can affect the world at least temporarily more than you can in most games through nukes.
---
Hi, I'm some people.  This is definitely the main I'm subscribed.
---
Ah nice, so you could afford 1 power armor for your dozens of hours of work and then will have to pay real money for any other atom shop item.
---
This basically kills your own argument.
---
That is the exact opposite of how agile project management works. my dev team works agile. FIRST you do the high impact stuff, then the low impact. NOT the other way around. If you have time left in the sprint, you can do the small things to fill up the sprint.   
---
So are we concluding that BGS doesn't even know how to do agile project management?
---
COSMETICS shouldn't cost that much. IIRC it's ~$1 per hundred Atoms. Pure cosmetics shouldn't cost more than $3-$5 depending on if it's a single skin for a weapon, single skin for whatever, or a pack of skins. For "functional" stuff, like C.A.M.P. items, that take quite a bit more effort than a simple skin(Think the Nuka-Cola or Slocum Joe's neon signs, refrigerator or Collectron, etc) a higher price is justified. Same with the scrap and repair kits(even though I hate gameplay-effecting stuff that costs Atoms as we were all told that wouldn't be the case).
---
Most mmorpgs now are more complex, swtor has instanced and ai that react to the events in those instances and such, 76 doesn‚Äôt have that much going for it.
---
Okay... Even if you are right and they are greedy than their greed is going to need to be fed in order to keep the game growing.
---
The game needs money and resources in order to stay online and grow.
---
That sounds even worse.
---
Excavator all the way
---
Careful now, the fanboys are lurking in this sub.
---
People buy them???
---
I think you're posting this about a year too late... All the complaints were already made when the game actually released and Bethesda did nothing.
---
That was a rally I got behind lol
---
I'd love to see how well Power Armour skins sell for Bethesda. I see a couple of people now and then wearing one of the rider skins, but nothing more than that. 
---
Personally as soon as I got the Nuka Cola skin in-game I never really felt the need to buy anything else.
---
Drifters Outfit, Cowboy Hat wrap around goggles Black Backpack and pipboy
---
Does brawling work with a dcg?
---
I'm reading the comments here and I'm just wondering: when did it become acceptable for the in game repaints and other insignificant stuff to be this fucking expensive.
---
I'm a game designer and a graphic designer myself and it blows my mind that this is what those huge companies, that some time ago i could look up to, are doing now: sell an unfinished, buggy mess for lower price just to get the money back through microtransactions.
---
PA repaints like these take an hour to make, tops.
---
How in the world did one guy sitting on his ass for an hour and doing smth that they should give out for free, if anything, to compensate their loyal players for sticking with the gams, turn into 18$ "micro"transaction.
---
i never said I didnt spend them.  I clearly said I dont spend them frivolously and 1800 for one paint job is beyond frivolous to decadent.
---
I believe in it getting better at some point as well hence while I still hang around in this subreddit.  I dont have any point I'd like to argue at this point.  It sucks right now (as does most of the gaming industry imo)
---
Have every set for collection with different paintjobs, using only Strangler Heart and sometimes Excavator for mining &amp; extraweight. All of them modded simularly: 2 calibrated legs, hydraulic bracer &amp; optimized bracer, jet pack, targeting HUD. Strangler Heart &amp; ultracite have jetpack on the left hand cuz Beth thinking its ok (3+ month since this bug implemented), chest is kinetic dynamo &amp; welded rebar (just dont have ultracite reactive plates). Instead ultracite targeting HUD can be used internal database, this mod easy to obtain and give you little extra EXP bonus (work great with double EXP weekend and EXP buffs)
---
It‚Äôs pretty clear Bethesda/Zenimax is going all-in designing this game for whales and whales alone. Let‚Äôs say you factor in the fact that you can earn a pittance of Atoms in game (some ways have been removed), and take $8 off the atom to dollar ratio, you could earn 800 atoms from heavy grinding for a week straight, that‚Äôs still $10 real world dollars for a skin. It‚Äôs still ridiculously overpriced no matter how you look at it.
---
To anybody complaining about these "micro" transaction prices, you're not the target demo. ZeniMax doesn't give a shit if you'd buy them if they were cheaper. Most people don't buy microtransactions. They're looking for the people who will spend $18 on a paint job. That's who they're going after. They don't care about the rest
---
Because there are idiots out there with money who don‚Äôt use their head and buy the stuff!!!  Simple really...  
---
It is dumb.  Game at launch cost 59.99.  For the game.  Now I‚Äôm going to sell you a paint job for 18.
---
I know, I was too
---
Meh, different strokes for different folks I guess. This is the stuff I would be grinding to buy.  Still sucks I dont have the blackbird power armor set üòï
---
claiming a workshop means you enter pvp 
---
so prepare for it
---
And the game works and your account is unlikely to spontaneously get deleted
---
because you will all keep buying it. 
---
it's the same reason that FO5 and ES6 will be MT ridden trash. This is what you asked for when you decided to support this game.
---
Right but after all the card swapping the idea of doing it for clothing too just intensifies the internal screaming.
---
&gt; You could get this by grinding in game without spending a dollar. 
---
Why is the fact that they're available for free relevant to the fact that the paid alternative costs too much, again?
---
I've checked its not there
---
Yes, it really should be for everybody or nobody (that's my opinion).
---
Some say it's pay-to-win, others that it's game-breaking, as a now second-class citizen of post-war Appalachia I would say the scrapbox is an in-game-economy breaking device. I used to sell bulk scrap at my vendor at what I think is a fair price, since the launch of Fallout 1st, I only sold a few screws. It seems like nobody wants to buy my aluminium, copper,or adhesive anymore which I used to sell frequently before.
---
Fact is, the scrapbox is not only something that makes playing more comfortable  for those who own one, it just puts a whole part of the in-game economy behind a paywall. I even saw on the fallout 76 market subreddit someone claiming he sells materials, with a picture showing he had 5k steel, 4k plastic, 4k copper, etc...
---
I don't know if he was serious or just a troll, but that's the way it is.
---
or just don't buy it.  It's just a skin.
---
I wonder how well Weightless and Ultralight work with all modifiers in comparison as a final end result...
---
Lol. I have never seen such as half-assed game in my life, and we eat it up. It‚Äôs like having a really shitty parent who we make up excuses for.
---
Or hacked by the company leaving a massive oversight when linking stuff from their website
---
If all you have to say is some snide comment please keep it out of my post thank you.
---
Found the guy who bought stock in popcorn!
---
Am Fanboy, Am Disappointed
---
That's bizarre. I'm playing the game anyway: I might as well be getting atoms for it. That's... not slave labour. I get no extra 'points' for playing Cities: Skylines. They aren't exploiting me any time I press play. Btw you're like the worst troll ever if you admit to not even playing the game. At least pretend.
---
Why do you think nearly anyone here does?
---
It‚Äôs not, frankly it‚Äôs asinine in my opinion. They have bugs and glitches to fix, but perhaps they need the revenue of selling atoms to fund fixing their issues
---
At level 200, I can earn about 100 atoms between the daily and weekly per week. Sometimes the dailies are easy and I have earned up to 500 in some weeks.
---
I'm not spending my own money on the atoms so I don't care. I did buy the 1st sub because I want junk stash space, I expected it to be a thing from day one, so when they did made it happen I was not surprised and did not freak out like this entire sub did. Based on the free atoms you get monthly from 1st, it's as if they are simply paying you back on your sub in atoms. I am really shocked that this sub hasn't caught on to that.
---
 
---
As it stands, most of the shit in the shop is just worthless in my opinion, however I get the vitriol this sub puts on it based on the conversion value. Stop looking at it that way if you are not paying money for it, look at the time you will spend earning atoms to get the shit, and then and only then will you realize if it's worth it.
---
Just gonna say: expensive cosmetics are nothing new, and depending on how it's done nothing wrong, either. Virtually every MMO sells some cosmetics for *well* in excess of the monthly sub or even the base game. Thing is, they're cosmetics; you don't *need* them, so it's generally accepted as okay.
---
Now what you **can** take issue with Bethesda for are the average prices and the godawful way most cosmetics are bundled and/or limited. Christmas Power Armor that you can only use on one of the underperforming power armor models. Decorations only sold in bundles of "two things you want and 8 you don't" for some ridiculous price. Things like that. Atom Shop was doomed to fail given those choices.
---
It finally popped up . Reloaded a couple times and it popped up where you said it was. Thx
---
How successful are you in killing at range? My experience with sniper rifles is usually ‚ÄúI get one shot before the target gets into cover, and that shot doesn‚Äôt kill them.‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs actually my experience with automatics, as well. I empty my clip, and barely get the enemy down 1/3rd of their health. I am then easily killed while I‚Äôm reloading. (Weirdly easy, like ‚Äúa few hits‚Äù easy. That‚Äôs partly why I was wondering if I was just focusing on the wrong weapons in short-medium range fights.)
---
They‚Äôre only charging what their numbers show that people will pay. If price isn‚Äôt scaled by region that‚Äôs bullshit though. 
---
I‚Äôm just pissed that I still needed the Black Ops suit that I‚Äôve been saving in-game earned atoms for, and I also want the matte black handmade paint. I try to only buy what I can earn thus far, and I can see this as their way of getting someone like me to pay for a month to ‚Äújust get‚Äù the NCR outfit and the Shadow Prime best PA paint I‚Äôve seen so far as a long-term regular player.
---
I suspect the idea is to get someone like me to get hooked on the First features enough to keep paying after a month when they release another item I can get for another week of challenges, as long as I keep my tent and scrap box for $13.
---
Do you want to get stuff every hour that you play so there is nothing else left to work for?
---
Except I thought creation club was to get some money back to the modders somehow...
---
Clearly you lack any sense of humor. I however quite enjoy a but of snark, to take the edge off the current situation Bethesda put itself into, but please, feel free to block me if you can't handle a bit of sarcasm.
---
The BGS priority is clearly on profitability over integrity and availability. They are a business after all, but I find it sad that after a year there are still so many fundamental issues that have gone unaddressed. Some bugs are random which are tougher to kill but most are regular friends. My most annoying reoccurring PC bug is the ‚ÄúI do no damage‚Äù one that has returned with a vengeance. It has been happening for me now for about a week. Target with VATS and fire but not register a hit even with a 95% chance to hit. Remove VATS and manually sight, still no damage. Switch weapons and damage is restored. Weird stuff like this is really annoying.
---
This is good thank you. And yeah I see people selling serum for 1-2k caps
---
Oh, hey, it's a time traveler from 2018, back when these threads still got thousands of upvotes on r/gaming! How's it going, past-bro?
---
It's like their seeing if you remember these skins and items and just revamp it back up in your face making you buy it again . Its ridiculous
---
You mean making excuses for assholes ISN'T normal?
---
Yea, those charred ghould would kick me all over the place, even with a machete.  The balance shifted when I got the cultist dagger, then the switchblade - more on that in a bit.   
---
If you using a melee weapon, aim for Mr Handy/col gutsy appendages, not the body.  There are a few Troubleshooters melee weapons.    Alternately, Vampire weapons will give you some heath regen for every hit, or fast AA melees.
---
Personally, for atlas observatory and the silo run, I equipped a troubleshooters gatling, and moved very slowly room to room to clear.  Watoga prior to finishing mayor for a day....I don't remember - other than I ran and hid   
---
 a lot.
---
Consider nerd rage and adrenaline perks, plus adrenal reaction mutation.  
---
Check the energy resistance on your armor. (pipboy/apparel/item.  Lightning bolt icon.)  
---
IIRC, grounded mutation reduces energy damage, but also reduces energy weapon effectiveness.
---
If you are using a ballistic weapon - for bots, a troubleshooters works well, alternate is an AA.  
---
Hardened or refined receiver and/or piercing mags also help against bots.
---
I'm not spec'ed for it, but in order to tag the bot boss..... the Gatling plasma served me relatively well during mischief week - it did better against the bots than it did against the ghouls and glowing ones.
---
Ghouls:
---
With the vampire switchblade, I take out most ghouls in 3-4 hits.  Less if one of the hits is a power attack.  
---
martial artist3, gladiator, and incisor3 help.  Glowsight if the enemy is glowing. 
---
If you have marsupial, jump to the top of the laundry room and fire station.  You can snipe the ghouls from there.  At the golf club, hit the doorway to attract their attention, when the run toward you, back up, Jump on top of the canopy, and either snipe or drop grenades/mines on the swarm there. (you should probably have fireproof if you do that.)
---
If you aggro the bots at WS (easy to do if you are ballistic), head to a rooftop.  Snipe them.
---
Prior to the switchblade (picked up at L65) , I used a L45 cultist dagger (L45-64) , and before that, an L20 vampire machete (L21-44), and had bloodymess3.  For L44 and below, I was in normal armor, not PA.
---
Just play for 7600 hours and your 20 atom reward will help. Or take a million pictures of impossible random encounters and receive your 10 atoms. You‚Äôll have that power armor skin in no time...unless it‚Äôs taken out of the store to.
---
Molotov Cocktails do the trick. AOE fire hits through the walls.
---
As a subscriber, I can safely say the scrap box was the one thing that sparked the least amount of excitement before using it. After using it, I can safely say that it gives you a MASSIVE advantage in-game, reducing my stash by 500lbs immediately and allowing me to stock up on trade-only-valued weapons and armor. 
---
I subscribed just for the atoms and cosmetics alone, with the $100/year breaking down to almost exactly 50% off the atom allowance, which gives the subscription plenty of value along with the exclusive cosmetics, survival tent, and private worlds alone.
---
The scrap box should absolutely be for everybody. It removes a ton of monotony and limitation from the endgame loop and makes the game more fun. Why would a company want people to buy a game that isn‚Äôt as fun as it should be? 
---
I‚Äôm a believer that making a base-game as fun and user-friendly as possible generates more sales of premium currency than hiding QoL behind a paywall 100% of the time because your player base enjoys and is engaged enough without the premium stuff and therefore feels like they care enough about the game to slap gold paints on their weapons and armors.
---
Negative, there are things that are far too egregious, this is the least egregious thing in my opinion.
---
It doesn‚Äôt have to be! Who is Bethesda‚Äôs rival? We‚Äôll just support them instead, like pitting parent against parent at Christmas time.
---
I remember getting the prime set which came with 2 paint jobs for $15 now they want me to spend $18 on just one paintjob
---
You know that lowering the real price of an item doesn't necessarily mean making it easier to acquire via non-paid atoms, right?
---
&gt; Is it harder to earn atoms at higher levels? 
---
If anything it becomes easier as you have the ability to clear daily and weekly challenges which initially might have seemed daunting with relative ease. OP has never played the game and is just going by what YouTube has told him, and YouTube just told him what he wanted to hear because that's how you get clicks and therefore ad revenue there.
---
If they had simply reported that lunchboxes had been datamined it wouldn't be an issue at all. Where they jumped the gun was making assumptions as to what they were and ruled everyone up based on those assumptions, which turned out to be totally incorrect.
---
It's literally just playing the game.
---
Then you would ask the admins for the same type of exception, for your new subreddit that is focused on this type of specific thing.
---
You're kidding, right? With the way this subreddit addresses complaints with so much anger, sarcasm and foul language, it would just devolve into a hate thread.
---
If you notice which posts get replies from community managers, they're always well stated and polite posts. Far too many people are comfortable posting threads like "FUCK YOU FIX THIS NOW YOU ASSHOLES" and then wonder why Bethesda won't engage with them.
---
Show me the daily and weekly challenges I can clear which would get me Automatron for free and I will call this a valid argument.
---
Same type of situation. If it's not a headshot, typically they scurry off and the battle concludes. Frog legs is helpful as well.
---
We need a bigger boat..
---
Nah. But anytime i see them people want 25k for them. Might sell at 1k but thats an item only a true completist will want.
---
Farming atoms is literally just playing the game. It's like little daily and weekly quests you complete to get in-game rewards.
---
Or you could spend less hours WORKING and buy it.
---
It would make buying them with real or fake money a non-issue for everyone.
---
Lol I thought they would change it each month considering they have to have 20 maps planned.
---
But if they acknowledge either of these points, what are they supposed to get upset about???
---
I'm not following?
---
Yeah, you bothered the snowflakes. People these days can't take anything without getting offended
---
Funny, the last complaints in my SWTOR guild before they disintegrated was that the newest expansions didn't even decently offer the illusion of choice because in the end it barely mattered what you chose.
---
The mannequins are explained in-game. There is a church or building in the mire that talks about how they are reminders of the lost, they are supposed to have pictures and notes with them.
---
Dark things? Like the thing in the Lucky Hole Mine? I want to know more about that scary thing!
---
Price depends on what you are willing to pay. The same reason you can buy Fallout 76 for twenty dollars today. I bought it as soon as it was physically available, and I paid a bit over 60 dollars. 
---
If people buy them (whatever they do: earning or buying atoms), prices won't fall. It's common sense.
---
That is never the case when I have a scorchbeast fall on me.  They are always empty.
---
A feature would be that a major mob corpse that you didn't loot falls on you when you fast travel, then you loot it, then it disappears forever.
---
A bug is that you loot a major mob corpse, it follows you where-ever you fast travel falling out of the sky every time, and there is nothing on the corpse because you've already looted it.
---
Another bug is that you didn't loot a major mob corpse...maybe you didn't even help kill it, but for some reason it has attached itself to you and falls out of the sky every time you fast travel.  That corpse is also empty, but it shouldn't have had anything for you to begin with.
---
Both of those bugs have been ongoing ever since they introduced the spawn / fall of a scorchbeast corpse upon fast traveling.
---
Many things with ini file, 1st change antialiasing to FXAA and look on Google you'll find many tricks.
---
careful, don‚Äôt point out anything positive about Bethesda, the goon squad will downvote you lol
---
Next up, for 1000 atoms you can start the faschnact event on your private server for a week.
---
Ok thanks
---
Lol I bought it because I think it looks fricking cool, and very few ultracite skin options! I might add, I used earned atoms only.... So didn't cost me a dime.
---
No joke.  My most downvoted comment is a little nugget of truth on a gaming subreddit with "the most friendly players"  some guy down below said he grinded out over 5000 atoms in a little over two months.  I'm failing to see how I'm wrong here.
---
So for the average person, if they want to grind out the paint job, it would take them around 100 hours?....... Not to mention its cosmetic, not worth it at all.
---
So I agree but man it would be a dumpster fire.
---
I'm telling you it's way overpriced.
---
Ahh oh okay, thanks for letting me know. Are they even rare or just how did I even get them lol.
---
I think you have to have some kind of ‚Äúanchor point‚Äù in the actual game world to load people into for other modes. It would explain why Vault 77 is in-game now, even if we‚Äôre never allowed inside. It gives them a physical spawn point to reference
---
I know
---
Or even a big picture window for a store glass building pieces would be great.
---
Because clearly you're argument carries any weight on the price. Yes, you could theoretically farm the points that they have factually nerfed, to get it free. This however does nothing to change the fact that it is STILL and $18 paint job. Making the excuse that you can get free atoms doesn't change that. It just means you have to spend more of your time to not pay for something that an $8 addition would have added in spades.
---
Make it function and show vending transactions.
---
That's really cool.  Wish they'd have more rare combinations show up as some sort of super special legendary creature.   A perfect storm of modifiers and it would have a chance of dropping a 4\* Legendary.  That would be sweet.
---
I wouldn't panic just yet. Mostly something to be aware of. Radium rifles can be a counter for bloody builds, and a draw for players who simply enjoy collecting weapons.
---
&gt;If the game isn't making money, then they'll just stop patching and updating
---
Borderline illegal and criminal, since they are patching and fixing problems which are their responsibility. If they put a broken car for sale and we paid full price, they need to fix it for free or give all of us our money back. This was not a free game. We already paid for a working game.
---
I somewhat agree. I won‚Äôt spend a single dollar in any video game currency ever again the D2 launch. That being said I don‚Äôt mind grinding for atoms and I understand the complaint that you just don‚Äôt get very many for long periods of grinding when it comes to how expensive atomic shop items are; you just can‚Äôt buy everything. I‚Äôm ok with not owning half the atomic store.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you on the price point, but it doesnt make my original comment of "you can get it for free" less valid.
---
&gt;  it is STILL and $18 paint job
---
Not if you get it for free.
---
The NW intro was horrible.
---
Oo, that would be nice too. Good idea.
---
If you have a buddy, just go to tanagra and hit a cricket, get to high ground, fast travel to uncanny caverns, when you load in have buddy kill the cricket.
---
Do the same for rad scorpions, sometimes they spawn at kiddie corner cabins or north at a raider camp in the forest (don't remember what it's called). Smack every scorp, get to high ground, fast travel to the divide and have your friend finish them. Otherwise I've had no problem getting them at Middle mountain, the freakshow or top of the world.
---
I would pay many atoms for a bunker entrance that opened up in an underground instanced space that I could build a much larger camp in.
---
Something akin to the vault dlc in Fallout 4.
---
shit i used to until i switched my build
---
They want your money. Since some atoms can be acquired in game they figure they'll get you hooked on the grind for a specific shop item, then hope you think "if I only spent $5..."
---
they idea is that not everyone is supposed to have every single atomic shop item, you need to pick the ones you like... its good to have options and variety on cosmetics, too many is a good thing not a bad thing. its a game its a grind its not just free everything for everyone lol earn your atoms.. even though as long as you do all the daily/weekly quests you should be rolling it atoms
---
It's not as good as just finding the right spawn where you need it, but it's an alternative.
---
If you want everything you have to pay money. It's that simple. Some dude below said he grinded out 5000 in a little over two months. I haven't even spent that much on the atomic shop since I started playing this game. I'm gonna spend it on this power armor cause I really did the look of it.  People are just upset they cant own everything the game has to offer for minimal effort.  To many hoarders here.
---
And what, pray tell, was my argument that I killed? that you used to be able to get 1800-2000 atoms in 50 levels? How, exactly, is that debunked?
---
There will likely never be any game without glitches, [but FO76 has an unusual number for a game at launch, and it's been a year since launch.]
---
Use an Area of Effect attack, explosives work [marginally, if you can lure the wolf to the right place.]
---
FOMO pricing. Additionally, 1st players are getting a monthly atom stipend, which may drive the price up if they predict the market will bear it. Most items are eventually listed with a sale price. If it's a cosmetic you want? Be patient/hodl. If not, vote with your wallet.
---
People will upvote if your post is good, not just because you've told them that they should. You sometimes have to put work in to earn those upvotes
---
Theyre kinda rare. It was an old glitch that let you pick it up but it was eventually patched out.
---
I'm glad you specified "plan" because now if Bethesda ever gets the bright idea to add it to the Atomic Shop only, I can call them bigger assholes than I currently do.
---
I never saw a difference in damage, so I went ultralight for the AP bonus and weight.
---
I fully support the idea of revisiting Halloween during the Christmas season.  If Fallout 76 had its own riff on The Nightmare Before Christmas, that would be pretty epic.
---
You're not. You're speaking your mind, and that's the right thing to do. This "karma" shit is useless one way or another, so don't be afraid to speak your mind.
---
The armor is Unyielding Sentinel across the board. I can get the third star from each piece as soon as I get home.
---
I was not so great at video editing at the time and was trying to mimic the 5xChameleon test I had just performed on my other character. That video has been lost, but I may be able to redo it. In that test, I wasn't even able to get within 20 feet without alerting the Deathclaw.
---
I don't think people on here understand how much some of these "whales" spend on games. There are people who spend thousands a month on games. Think about the fact that there's probably one person who has spent more than everyone who upvoted this combined. That's why this will never change.
---
its a cosmetic optional skin, no one is entitled to it, its supposed to be a little grindy to buy them... if everyone just owned everything from Ashop it would feel kind of lame
---
That shadow prime is not worth 1800. 800-1000 would be better.
---
turn on pacifist mode, then that shit cant happen again.
---
Speaking the truth!
---
Nobody tell OP about POE supporter packs ($60 USD for just an outfit!).
---
I mean League of Legends honestly has a pretty darn awesome micro-transaction model right now. I don't really buy into it, but they essentially have mini-season passes, multiple in an actual season that allow you to earn special points from playing matches that you can use towards seriously cool cosmetic stuff. Like one of the first ones they did was "chroma" colors or alternate colors to a bunch of the championship skins along with epic load-in screen borders. I ate that up because I main Thresh.
---
Its gotten a bit worse as the years have gone on with the monetization, but its still not too bad in the game considering its free to play with the ability to reasonably unlock new champions as you can earn champion shards which lower the price of the specific champion it is a shard of. As a side note you can also earn champion **skin** shards, and the thing is the game doesn't allow shards of "legendary" skins but the thing is you can still roll them, they just instantly unlock for you without you needing to do anything else. I've gotten a few. OH there are also gemstones you can earn, (all of these are earned from chests btw that you earn from either you or your teammates doing well in-game or that you buy from the shop, though the chests require a key) which you can either turn instantly into a chest and key, or save up 10 of them to unlock a completely exclusive badass skin that you cant get anyway other than gemstones.
---
So I'd say Riot has their balance down pretty well.
---
Build a purifier or pump for dirty water if you dont have the purifier plan yet at your camp or workshop.Water from a purifier doesn't need to be boiled so no wood.
---
Also, I dropped shadow texture quality and it really really helped!
---
I used to make textures and skins myself. Once you have a template it is really easy to do color swaps. New markings takes a bit more even with a 3d model. None of it is easy some less difficult than others. With the audience they have even if they halved the price they would still make allot of money. More people would be willing to buy as well.
---
Sounds like you just don't have any creativity and are angry some people do.
---
Do you know if we can place stuff on the table??
---
Ohh okayy, yeaa haven't played for a bit and just started loving the game again. So I was just organizing some things and saw it.
---
I mean, they didn't have to.  They could have kept Nuclear Winter's around for another, what?  Five months?
---
I just think that the Nuclear Winter intro set the wrong tone going into the game.  Suppose you knew absolutely nothing about Fallout 76.  What would you glean from looking at that video and music?  It makes it look like 76 is about a forest fire and some place called Vault 51.
---
The original intro?  It screams "Adventure!"  Look at all these places you can go!  Listen to the pounding drums in the music like you're hiking in the wilderness and climbing mountains.  And then it blends into the Fallout theme.  How is that not a million times better?
---
Don't forget to take your green thumb with you...
---
Lol. NV was genuinely, no exaggeration "unplayable" at launch and it's paraded around here as if it was a divine work of art. Still is near unplayable on consoles a decade later...sooooo
---
As for "luring" wolves or anything else, they have the same attack patterns every time. You listen, it all times out the same. It takes about 2-3 min to learn any enemy spawn attack patterns and sounds, and that makes them incredibly easy to kill. 
---
I still keep feeling like the main reason people like hating on 76 is cause they just are really not that great at the game and without being able to load into cheats and God mode out of the gate they have no idea what they are doing. Lol.
---
There's a guy in the big server room that hosts all of the servers that has to change out the reels of magnetic tape that host the game. Every once in a while he is a little slow to swap them out and you get a hiccup.
---
I'm not too sure I'll experiment and let you know
---
Bet you're a fun guy to be around
---
We're the good kind of redditors. We don't downvote shit just because we don't like what we hear, we speak our minds, and we aren't afraid to tell the truth, no matter how bad it is.
---
The bad redditors are the people who downvote shit just because they don't agree with it. Seriously, like, grow up, you know?
---
There is a Berkley/Harper's Ferry map (same size as the others) and a Charleston map that is much smaller (possibly for some special mode).
---
Visited the interloper at lucky hole mine again recently.
---
It‚Äôs nasty, eerie and dark. They should elaborate on that and other darker themes. Dressing up as a turkey is fun, but not what I want from Fallout 76 all the time.
---
So you could be out far from home and think of shit the sun's going down so you be more cautious and should probably get ready rnsome intense battles
---
When I say this I'm not trying to be a dick but just putting something into perspective. Can you get everything in game playing a few hours a day for free?  If not, I dont see how it's better in the long run. We could all be running around in vualt suits and one standard looking power armor and everything else we wanted to do would cost "just a few bucks" or we could grind for it like LOL. It's easier to acquire stuff when it's cheap for one hero. It's different when you try to get EVERYTHING which is why people are really mad here. They want the power armor and the pretty plants and cool boxes.
---
Begging for upvotes usually has the opposite effect.
---
Be kinda cool if we could change which screen it was in the options.
---
300 atoms.  Easy enough to get if you want it.
---
Pay to win what?
---
Got me with a dang nuke! LOL
---
Someone else said around 100 hours of play time. If its a 7-10 day grind for the atoms then that isn't too bad, but it wouldn't be worth it regardless because you would probably want the fridge etc. But then doesn't it get harder to grind atoms after a little while?
---
come by my camp sometime if yr on xbl, gt is the same. i actually use unmarked locations and use as little as possible (one could say i handicap myself). it‚Äôs much more difficult to make a camp in these places than starting from a floor.
---
but none of this goes into my decision making here.
---
Well fuck. Thanks.
---
No, just 1% change :) there are aroun 5 skins in total and you should only place 1 at a time... 4 makes no diference.
---
It took my fiance and I about 150-200 attempts
---
I now want a PA with pockets...
---
I would say it's just a bunch of kids in here that cant follow directions but its school time in most places right now I think.
---
On a related note - could you add the Vintage Football Uniform to this list of "Things that clip badly through armor"? üòÇ
---
Not really. Take the time, to currency earned ratio into count. The job I work pays me $14 an hour. If I spend than hour in game farming atoms, can I make more than 1400 in an hour, or is it not cost effective? If I'm going to talk to you about what is, or isn't free, since nothing is free anymore, I feel breaking it down in this manner is best. Time does in fact equal money, and even at say, minimum wage, my time is worth more than what I could "make for free". Simple economics. You are tricked into believing that you are getting this for free, but you aren't. You had to pay for the game, the internet, take time out of your life that could actually earn you FAR more, and even then, you think it's free. You have been psychologically programmed to feel a dopamine release with every little reward you get, and because you cannot see past your basic instincts of reward for obedience, you will never see that nothing, and I mean NOTHING is free. Please, continue to turn a blind eye to the slippery slope that Bethesda is trotting on though. Folk like you are why it's gotten so bad.

---
The mainframe cores being immune to damage really surprised me last night. What a mess... they‚Äôre always screwing something up. Can‚Äôt wait for the damn jet packs fix.
---
I've never had a Sheepsquatch spawn at NAR.   Considering I go through there quite regularly, that's pretty crazy.   I've literally never seen one there.  If I do see one there, one day, I'm going to be very surprised.  It's not that I don't believe you, it's just mind boggling how many times I've been to that area and not seen one.   It just makes me wonder what is it that causes yours to spawn one there sometimes and me, never.
---
Pacifist mode, if you don't want to PvP, why aren't you using it?
---
Because I didnt know it was a thing.
---
Ugh, it gonna be a long couple weeks just grinding this out then? üòÇ thank you
---
Why do you think it's not cool? Any idea how many active players are out there? Any idea what it costs them to keep this game going?  How much money did it cost them to make? How many hours did it take? How well paid are the employees?   We have no idea how much they're making off this. people keep saying the prices are too high and that Bethesda is too greedy without any data.  I suspect unless they are as stupid as everyone says they are that they are making money at this and a good amount. But that's just a guess.  If anyone has some hard numbers that actually come from Bethesda please share them.  Of course Bethesda could be lying.  Unless you work there you don't really know.
---
I disagree with about 90% of the decisions they have made to this point. It's almost comical how bad the decisions were. Frequently they choose the worst option  possible.  .I'm just pointing out that all these claims of avarice are built on a foundation of nothing.
---
Is 1800 Atoms unreasonable for players to grind? Yes. That is more than 3 months of dailies and weeklies I am guessing off the top of my head.  Atom rewards should be higher.
---
I have a friend who looks at the money spent as an entertainment budget. If you play 50 hours a month and you spend $30 a month then it's a pretty good bargain.  What other hobby costs so little per hour?
---
If you don't like the prices then don't pay them.  You have older players who are big fans of fallout and have disposable income and are willing to spend it.
---
I fully welcome my down votes to oblivion.
---
&gt; This shit is why ~~they need to bring back survival~~ I should have turned on Pacifist Mode. 
---
üòâ
---
i should also add- if it was possible to give more budget then i‚Äôd be all for it. but we are restricted in other ways that we could all greatly benefit from, and increased camp budget would diminish the opportunity for those things to happen!
---
"Get to level 200"   
---
No thanks.
---
Survival mode was all but deserted, that's a big part of why it got cancelled. No point in dumping resources into a mode that very few people actively used.
---
Like the other guy said, just turn on pasivist. There's always going to be those assholes that spend their time picking on people who don't want to PvP.
---
KaRmA fArM tImE!!!
---
People are down voting us and losing critical information on Sneak/NPC Stealth lol. Every time someone contradicts Captainnoob's video (which was removed last time I checked), people try to drown it out with their own opinions rather than facts. As long as that happens, people will always believe false information.
---
&gt; Ok, get to level 200 and let's see how many atoms you're able to earn weekly
---
You can earn 50 a day, plus 180 for the weekly challenges. For a total of 530 Atoms. That's 2120 a month, for doing the timed challenges. I'm not defending them charging 1800 for a power armor skin, but don't act like you can't get a significant number of Atoms per week by just doing the daily challenges. 
---
Now, whether that's worth logging in everyday and doing menial tasks like picking flowers and taking pictures is up to you. Personally, I don't. But getting 20-30 a day starts to add up. I was able to buy the Thanksgiving decorations (table, chair and display case) with the free Atoms I've earned in the past few weeks by just doing some challenges. My son just does that and bought the scrapbot last week and he's level 20, among other things he's been able to earn.
---
Bethesda needs to turn down the price for these items. Even the "sale" prices this week are laughable. New items are usually priced sky high. The Thanksgiving stuff was moderately priced, so I got it. But they can fuck right off if they think I'm paying $18 for an oddly proportioned, discolored Liberty Prime skin. I'm a First subscriber and I won't even buy into that bullshit.
---
Disclosure: The only power armor skin I bought was the Raider Waster skin because I liked the way it looked and it was in a bundle for 1800, with a backpack, outfit, icon, salute, Pip-Boy paint, 50 cal paint and flag. At the time, I used a 50 cal and I still use the backpack, icon and Pip-Boy paint. That was a decent value for the money, but 1800 for "Shadow Prime" is dumb.
---
True. Most kids here in the US should be in school right now.

Classical conditioning¬†(also known as¬†Pavlovian¬†or¬†respondent conditioning) refers to a¬†learning¬†procedure in which a biologically potent¬†stimulus¬†(e.g. food) is paired with a previously neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell). It also refers to the learning process that results from this pairing, through which the neutral stimulus comes to elicit a response (e.g. salivation) that is usually similar to the one elicited by the potent stimulus.
---
&gt;I think this microtransactions thing has made pretty much every game they are in a shitshow.
---
Was literally just commenting on this but okie dokie artichokie.
---
That would sell me on it
---
Head over to the DMV area at the Charleston Capitol building.  It's high-level, but you won't need to stick around.  Right inside the entrance, there's an Overseer Cache that contains plans for the Small Water Purifier.  Build a couple at your CAMP and never worry about water again.
---
This. Water purifiers are the best, get about 5 small ones set up, and just spend an hour or so looting them, should give you a nice little stock. After that just loot then every time you go back to your camp. 
---
I also grab people's water when I'm vendor hopping. So that usually keeps me topped off.
---
Ahhh. Should've specified. Sorry friend.
---
The first 3x I did turn-ins, I got paint each time.   
---
This was before the "takes all the tech data you have in inventory" thing was fixed so it only takes one.
---
Haven't gotten paint since.
---
Thank you!! One more thing: does the purifier need to be inside a body of water? I built my C.A.M.P away from water and I was wondering if I had to move it.
---
Cosmetics? Considering how much of the playerbase base their sense of accomplishment in the game based on the design of their camp or their getup.
---
Yeah, exactly, that was at the tip of my mind. Especially since registers already exist in the wasteland... I don't feel they should be exclusive to the atom shop. The asset is already there, use it Bethesda!
---
Ok, thanks for the help!!
---
blame for what? its a good thing that some items in atomic shop are high atoms, it makes you grind for them and also this way not everyone can just buy everything from the shop. you need to pick and choose with you atoms, it means people will have a variety of different items. why does everyone feel they are entitled to cheap or free everything all the time? its an additional cosmetic skin,jeez. people like you just take any chance to bash Bethesda, its getting old as shit
---
Im just imagining a bunch of dudes sitting at their computer not doing their actual work just mad as hell right now over a reddit post.
---
I kinda miss that bug, it was great having the blight in my inventory lol
---
It took us about a month doing it religiously. VTU is a great place for the plans, RobCo in the Cranberry Bog, Sugar Grove and the Enclave Bunker's Military wing have loads. We found that taking 1 plan at a time was better than taking 3 or 4 as it seems to only account for 1 at a time.once we started getting the plans, we got them quickly. Make sure you learn the plans before going again or the higher ranks won't prok
---
X-01 is a must for nuke zones since they nerfed rad resist on all other sets some months ago. T-51 seems to have the best numbers for damage and energy damage resist. 
---
Jet packs are currently bugged. Until they fix them, emergency protocols or even something simple as motion assist servos is nice for the chest piece.
---
I like targeting HUD for the helmet, but it can be annoying for photo mode. 
---
Calibrated shocks are a must for the legs. Dabbled with kinetic servos, seems to not work as well as it did in Fallout 4.
---
Optimized Bracers for arms, still unsure if I notice the difference from that mod, but in theory it‚Äôs great.
---
That Purifier does not.  The Industrial one does.
---
You can do multiple a day just dont loot desks that dont have them.
---
Also there is a short yt vid on where to find and rewards. Wikedchickity( sp?) is name i think?
---
the scrap box is the single best feature of the subscription. not a chance its going to the non subscribers
---
I also think this is something everyone should have had from the start. However, I'm also practical in the sense that most people bought the subscription for Private Worlds and/or the Scrapbox. Without something equally enticing, Bethesda will never give those items away. Imagine McDonald's giving away food and trying to sell subscriptions to something like napkins. Napkins don't drive sales.
---
Yea, for the first ~30 levels, they throw atoms at you like it's crazy. Walk 10 feet...  20 atoms! Become level 2.... 50 atoms!
---
After you play longer, the daily/weekly events can take a long time, and only give 10 atoms.
---
#NO
---
An AMA would be an absolute disaster.
---
Ok, thanks again!
---
cry more lol
---
Small purifiers do not need to be placed in water.  Large and industrial must be placed in water.
---
You'll need a generator to run the purifiers.
---
The wasteland is chalk full of stories, some are more obvious than others.    You get out of it what you put into it.  It's all in the holotapes, the written notes, and tons in the visuals / sight gags / little hidden random spots you run across sort of accidentally.  They're strewn about on "paths" between places so that if you run in a certain direction from somewhere you'll come across stories as simple as the serial killer who positioned stuffed bears around a dead body making it look like they killed him to the story of the Imposter Sheepsquatch.    Entire Buildings have their own stories / set of stories.   The tents outside of Poseidon tell their own kind of story or add to the overarching story line of "they took our jobs".
---
It really sounds like you just scratched the surface of the game.
---
Is it bad to want it? Id rather pay 30 Bucks for each season and have all of it then pay 18 for a fing reskin
---
The bushes were a menace!
---
I never got any plans after dozens of tries, then I bought the initiate paint from someone and I'm told that will prevent me from getting any of the other paints. No clue if it's true because 'not getting paint' seems to be my default setting
---
Is the table able to hold items?  I may have to splurge on it if it does.
---
Like the 40 atoms you get by playing 7600 hours?
---
Bird bones is 4 Agi and there is an under armor that is 3 Agi.
---
Just for jokes don't get triggered
---
I *resemble that
---
XD maybe they'll get caught if we piss em off enough
---
Got bird bones. And just realized I‚Äôm missing an under amor lmao
---
Ok that explains why the bullets don‚Äôt explode
---
I can do you one better than the usual 0 ammo reload bug on login....having 249 shots loaded in your hunting rifle mag on login.
---
A surprise, to be sure, trying to reload that thing after shooting the low-level scorched that attacked my camp but a welcome one.
---
You are 100% correct fellow vault dweller. They did state they were looking to add bigger camps but they did state it was for private servers so not sure how they will do it. Was listed in on a somewhat recent new update on Bethesda site, and if I recall correctly the first Fallout 1st new update but can't check it myself.
---
It's not very difficult to earn about 300-500 a week through the daily and weekly challenges. Typically I do 3-4 of the Daily ones, usually trying to do the 20 atom one, so that's about 30-50 a day. Weekly ones are 30-40 atoms each, and I usually do at least 4 of those. So that's about 120-150. So it's not too hard to average about 400 a week if you try and have the time. I've been doing that on and off since launch and I've got 5060 atoms in surplus right now. Not a dime spent.
---
Having things for free is nice but I wouldn't mind spending 150 atoms on things like this.  Everything is just so damn overpriced.
---
people are so entitled, its a cosmetic option, one of many you can choose to spend atoms on. not everyone is supposed to own every cosmetic
---
As much as I know Bethesda would have some amazing insight into all things game business and fallout, this "community" gives me no hope toward a productive AMA. It would turn into a trolly shit show.
---
And tables and desks.
---
Power armor paint is way to expensive, it would be so cool to see people in different power armor paints wondering all the time but NOPE they‚Äôre $14
---
Lol.  I'm not trying to troll anyone but it would be funny. Someone table flip their station and the boss is like "what's the problem here" and they're all, "someone said something true on reddit"
---
That is not what im saying. However the skins they sell for such an absurd price arent worth a quarter of it when u look at it objectively.
---
Maybe i just miss when people actually had standards for those companies and the companies actually delivered on a lot of those expectations instead of disappointing and milking.
---
I wonder if this is canon, the whole point of going to vault 51 was to defeat the AI. What if we just filled in the vault after shutting it down ? That would make sense canonically. Now if only they‚Äôd give me that hellfire armor and shut down Nuclear Winter to match ü§î
---
And this patch was such a bust. 
---
No idea why they don't just start events and let them run till New Year or something. Give us something to do instead of just focusing on the Wastelanders delay and that they removed Survival mode just so that Fallout 1st subscribers can spin up private servers. 
---
Instead we get more shit we have to pay for. Ugh.
---
What changed?
---
wots the ins and outs of that fix. tried putting 3 in stash, and turning in 1. won't except another, until I find more. ?  Might also be the reason I can find them at bots vendors, but wont activate the quest. ( must have missed this one in patch notes )
---
Yea its a good deal if you buy atoms for sure but really wish they threw out atoms and charged $5 per month instead. Sitting on 11,000 atoms and never bought any I just played everyday for about first 6 months and I mean EVERYDAY.
---
standards? its an additional cosmetic thats grindy to get, there is no standards problem here,  its an optional skin lol.  I swear this generation is so entitled its getting ridiculous
---
That makes 0 economic sense from their PoV though. They set prices based on what people are willing to pay, so apparently $18 isn't too much to ask for most people. Especially considering you can still offset that cost for free. So.
---
No sense in getting mad over it. Buy it, or don't, but getting angry isn't going to change anything.
---
They removed the exaggerated flare at the bottom so it kinda loses its iconic look. It also clips into the legs like crazy due to the wonky physics engine. It looks a bit more realistic sure but it looks worse than before
---
Exactly why I don‚Äôt buy atom points with real money for a virtual cosmetic. I like a lot of the offers in the atom shop but cannot justify the hefty price tag
---
To fix, exit the respawn map with esc and go into it again. That's worked for me, but they may have changed something.
---
No. You should follow the terms of service you agreed upon, otherwise you should get banned.
---
If it keeps the game running and they add to it, I'm fine with it. Given, I'd never pay a penny for any of this garbage, but others will apparently. I thank them for their sacrifice. Im still waiting for my 70$ initial purchase to be worth it. Getting close, but let's see what wastelanders does for it.
---
that's why I rarely get anything in the atom shop - no camp budget to place it.
---
Lmao. Imagine them just yeeting their computer out the window and storming out of the office yelling: "I hate these damn truthful reddit posts!"
---
because they make more from the dumb willing to spend more money than the majority spending $5+ on atomic shop. Not a single paintjob in the shop is worth 800+ atoms and everyone knows it.
---
Then their boss is like "something true on reddit!!??  Find the link so I can downvote this asshole too"
---
It is and that's why you're being downvoted.
---
The atom shop is most definitely overpriced, but your point remains valid, which is why you have tons of downvotes and few replies.
---
When you have a counter point, you reply.  When you are just pissy and wanna toss a table because you cant keep up with the discussion, you throw downvotes instead of cogent counter replies.
---
Good news is karma is useless here despite some caring more about it than their own rent or mortgage from, you know, REAL life.
---
I think it's an age thing.  Reddit has a vast group represented but the masses seem to be angsty late teens to late 20s/early 30s.  That stage of life is where many go apeshit and just need to vent so if anything, I let them downvote, take their 'win' and hope it improves their week ahead.
---
Life is too crazy and dark to punch down so I just let the downvoters have their joy as it literally does not affect the person being downvoted in the slightest.
---
As Father Matt says: it is harder to speak truth than to remain silent.
---
It's also a great vats build. Luck of 33 gives you a critical every other shot.
---
Im not mad, never bought PA skins because I dont use them... expet if they come in a bundle like the raiders bundle... Im just supporting a model that resembles mostly with a battle pass... and that makes economic sence... I'd rather pay to have Wild Apallachia with skins as rewards then to have all for free to have to pay 18 for a fking skin.
---
Just picked one up from playing randomly last night so if it was patched out, it‚Äôs been reintroduced.
---
You're getting lambasted for approaching a shitty situation from the perspective of a realistic adult.
---
Not many of them in this thread it would seem...
---
Griefers gonna grief. Sorry you had to deal with that.
---
Hit level 5 on new alt this weekend, was busy so ignored pop up, had a duo on me within 5 min. Seems pretty lame if they were on lookout for that.
---
Imo its just bad design to make it auto turn off pacifist at lvl 5. Should be a conscious decision to have pvp enabled.
---
  Didnt ruin my day but if i just started and had no idea why lvl 108 tommytryhardxxx69 and his buddy lvl 97 pattypunchurface420 were killing me and following me around emoting the whole time i might just stop playing and agree with neg press of this game before coming to my senses and figuring out about pacifist and how to turn it on.
---
If I enjoy playing the game - which I do - and I get in-game rewards for playing the game I enjoy, I don't really consider it a bad thing.
---
I assumed for the SBQ you had to be the one with the final hit that dropped her to 0.  With ~20 other people and massive automatic guns, it becomes a random chance yours might be the one.
---
A few factors play into this. Firstly if you play solo/team that makes a difference. If you're solo, unless you're a gaming goddess, focus on survival. There's more xp in it. In that case stick with close quarters or melee as you're goal is to stay hidden.
---
Second the terrain in this latest map is very diverse. You can either find yourself fighting an up hill battle toward monongah mine, aiming down the mountain or urban warfare. Again if you're solo, the above builds are best for these situations. But if you're on a predictable team, each person plans for a few scenarios and where the terrain finds you. I run heavy gun build which is best for supporting your team vs being a primary offender.
---
Lastly, the best successes I've had all revolved around playing smart. Not about immense twitch skills. A solid team with smart players will at the very least get you to top ten and often get you to overseer.
---
It‚Äôs subjective. Just like buying a 5.00$ candy bar could be subjective. How bad do you want the candy bar? This is obviously turning into a cash grab.
---
Sounds like someone is jelly of their free time?
---
Be kinder and keep the point on track and not devolve to making this personal.
---
I would love if they started the Fasnacht event! Never got to collect all of the furniture plans üòÇ
---
I think it probably is an age thing. I'm at a point in life where I like to spend money on stuff I enjoy.  One thing is cars, the other is video games.  I dont look at prices of flex fuel kits or new turbos and get pissed off and email the company. I say "shit, I guess I'll have to put in some more hours at work"
---
Thanks for your post.
---
'Hoarders.'
---
Nail on the head.  "I want it all, but I dont wanna have to earn it or pay for it!"
---
You're definitely not wrong.
---
Well porkproducts is spot on that would help server stability as stated by Bethesda reason they don't increase Camp further is due to server stability. Then again I would like to know how much stress server is getting from camps because last I checked they used same thing to justify limiting stash which is true on some aspects but items with no extra variables like junk and aid items are easily handled by servers.
---
Conclusin : they followed the terms of service.

---
I see this now lol.
---
Yup!
---
That being said, enjoy the game. Some people love grind. Some people see one item and splurge, but prices in games like Fortnite are getting out of hand
---
God you are an asshat. I wasn't begging.
---
I've been thinking of doing something meta-game.  I've written pen/paper RPGs for years, and I also write fiction.  Of all the stories I've felt they were fairly weak -- and this has made me consider if I could do something better.  I've thought of a series of challenges, but I haven't done anything about it because it'd be a meta-game thing.  I.e we'd have to figure out ways for people to get the next clue, and verify if they've figured out the current one.
---
There are a few locations and holo's that I haven't found any lore around, and I've been stitching together a storyline from that.
---
Glitch implies unintended side effect. Considering what this Reddit is like on jumping on what is perceived as Bethesda‚Äôs cock ups, and this isn‚Äôt one of them, but a misunderstanding of consequences, It‚Äôs fair that‚Äôs it‚Äôs highlighted
---
&gt; Don't understand it, just plain greed.
---
Well if you're just gonna answer your own question...
---
The whole buying stuff after you buy the game is insane. I would have never of guessed in a million years that this would be a thing but here it is.  But, you gotta pay to be able to look good while you play.
---
Pre-patch, if you had, say, 20 tech data documents on hand, the turn-in would take all 20 from you.  There was a theory the more you turned in, the better your odds of getting paint.  (That I recall, the theory was never proven, or was proven to be wishful thinking, not reality)
---
After the patch, regardless of how many tech data documents you have on hand, it only takes one.  
---
You cannot feed the box single documents and get rewards for each one.  You have to find a new document to (re)activate the quest.   Dropping extras from inventory then picking it up does not count.
---
The fact the game is still laggy and broken in a lot of ways shows how much they place Money over the game itself a year later
---
Why is everyone so shocked...they wanna recoop losses on this disaster....and mostly cause there is always a buyer for something....ALWAYS!!! that will never change.
---
It's just stupid of you ask me. I just want to run around and have fun, collect junk, explore and kill irradiated monsters I have no interest in playing pvp and yet some people will harass the shit out of you if you dont. Bot to mention when the "exploit" the attack/retaliate system to get you to do something you dont want to do. Now obviously there are ways to get around that. It just ruins the experience of the game and likes makes me really not want to sign in and play.
---
But that's just me being whiny I guess.
---
the stash excuse in nearly untrue. if a player had only weapons and armor then yeah, that would take more server load due to all the uniqueness of items. but whether you have 10 Nuka Quantums or 10,000 does not matter whatsoever and Bethesda plays that tune realizing many (if not most) players are ignorant as to how servers work etc.
---
It's not defending Bethesda or apologizing for it. I'm not trying to make excuses why you should buy it. It's simple, if you don't like it then don't buy it. Be a damn adult.
---
And all the co-workers come swarming over to him to see it as he gets the link off his phone
---
I love parties, and since we're all here around the punch bowl, "Correlation" is *absolutely* correct. The character death from a low-health condition is a result of radaway's connection with the hunger/thirst meter, and the hunger/thirst meter's connection to health and maximum health. *Now* we're solidly in irony territory.
---
I was curious if it was just going to be the bottom shelf you could display things on
---
Nope. Got promoted to Knight -Captain Just this weekend.
---
I always vats the legs. Cripple it!
---
Why is it that your account is 8 days old and all you've done is talk about how great 76 and F1st is
---
He kills me in 2 hits... And I'm lvl150 ffs..
---
You get more value with Creation Club stuff. Example: they give out Pip-Boy skins for free on the regular. Even if they aren't free, they are 50 cents. Fallout 76 - $5. 
---
For $6 in the Creation Club, you can get the pack to build you own Slocum's Joe in every one of your settlements, complete with new crafting tables and a new job for a settler. You can build in every settlement, so if you have 20 settlements, that's 20 Slocum's Joe. And you get like 30 new crafting recipes with stat bonuses THAT STACK. In Fallout 76, $6 won't even buy you a fridge to make 15 food items rot slower, that you can only make 3 of. Wow.
---
How about one of those Bay Windows as well? Could be used for displaying or for just getting some nice natural light for your plants. I admit, I have many plants around my camp.
---
This^
---
Please correct me if I am wrong. From what I understand, you are suggesting that purchasing cosmetic items from the atom shop in FO76 specifically could be seen as pay to win. The rationale is because of how people perceive themselves after they purchased the item?
---
If that is the case, then no. Pay to win would mean you are able to buy an advantage over another person regarding the mechanics of a game. Having the ability to change your appearance will let you create the story you want to, but not give you an advantage mechanically.
---
5 years
---
And as an adult, expect folks to have their own opinions. Just because you don't like what someone says, doesn't mean they cannot say it.
---
It‚Äôs cute how you think they are reading Reddit at Bethesda.
---
Nice, thanks for sharing your experience!
---
Take the high ground anakin!
---
\+50% budget would be dope.  Really, the main things we need are flipping guilds, increase the open world group size to 8, and with the guilds allow a "guild" settlement that spawns in with guild members of sufficient rank.
---
Oh thanks, guess I can stop refreshing every half hour
---
But it's all been mined flat! Lol
---
it was in the list of ‚Äúmights‚Äù that is incorrectly assumed to be confirmed
---
I was looking at the atom shop prices yesterday (I only ever buy repair and scrap boxes with atoms I earn in-game), and was thinking the same thing as you. These aren't even "micro" transactions ($1, $3). Those prices are the price of entire games. I mean right now you could buy Fallout 4 for $20. An entire game with hundreds of hours of content, for $20. And they want $18 for a skin? Get outta here.
---
You on PS4 i can literally come one shit the fucker for you? ü§£
---
You realize that the only reason the stash is limited at all, is so that Bethesda can sell the solution?
---
I mean I really hope you are not one of those people who believe, that a LIST of object IDs with a number that represents said objects count, can somehow make the server unstable in 2019.
---
Tho with Beths quality one does wonder...
---
There are a lot of leaps in your legal logic there. It happens a lot in the industry. Games that just weren't making a prophet end up abandoned by the developers and publishers. It sucks, but that's the nature of the business.
---
I enjoy hunting for atoms in-game to get some of that new content.  Thats something to do.
---
I used my hard earned Atoms on this one without a second thought. It looks PERFECT for displaying junk and actually fits into the world, as opposed to the glass cabinets (which look FINE but don't really fit into most CAMPS, if you're going more for the immersion and roleplaying aspect). I hope they do more of these type of display cases!
---
What are you talking about?? Yes I'm a newer member but I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've mentioned anything about Fallout 1st. I personally do think 76 is a hreat game. Definitely has its ups &amp; down but I &amp; many others enjoy playing it. Go troll somewhere else mate. You don't like the game ok....Your choice.
---
I'm with you. Sick of tools trying to initiate pvp w me. I'm on adventure mode for a reason.
---
I've got free time, but spending over a full 24/hour day grinding out items for an in game cosmetic is not my idea of a fun time and it's absurd that one should have to put in that much time for something that simplistic
---
Usually, they have them worked out in the first hour or two.  I have no idea what happened this week.
---
Ccccc z
---
Seriously. Downvote me if you want, but there just isn't a lot to do in the game. There isn't. The same event, again? Sorry, no thanks. This is a live service game and to be honest it is just barely treated like one. New events or quests need to be added regularly. Even stuff like meat week will suffice. Just give us something.
---
Hahahahaha
---
In game rewards aren't bad, but they do eventually condition people to ignore the bigger issues by opening up arguments like "but you can farm it free". I'm not telling you to hate the game, but I'm also not going to not call out a steaming pile of bullshit when I see it. There are many online games, that are in much better shape than this one. Stable, and pump out tons of free actual content, that survive solely on cosmetic shops. The trick to it is to price things at an acceptable price,  and to have currency specials. IE, every $10 you spend for the next week gets you a free random cash fashion, or other cash shop item. One of the oldest games I still play does that rather often, and they bring in more than enough revenue to continue making the game.
---
Especially when they "trick" the game into attack/retaliate because he jumped in front of me. But I've learned my lesson and turned on pacifist so that shouldn't happen again.
---
It always seems to be the mutant hounds too.  After about an hour and 3 failed defenses/ retakes... this hell hound will magically end up on the roof.
---
I think this would be a relatively easy thing since the faction robots are in game already. I always laugh at the Raider bots. Lol
---
Thanks. This makes sense.
---
The point I'm trying to make is this game feels like an overpriced cash grab for what we actually get, and if they just took the time to listen, and fix things, it would be a FAR better game, with a much healthier  community.
---
Same here, this is ab absolutely repeatable problem
---
Except for cooking which requires boiled water for some damn reason
---
I was curious if that was possible too.
---
agreed, this is a shit daily mission anyway, don‚Äôt make me server hop, probably just so you can artificiality inflate your metrics on how many log in daily
---
Asking for an upvote, that's a down votin
---
Where is this pacifist button?
---
No you're getting downvotes coz you're a fucking idiot. It is impossible to grind within the "limited time" these items stay for if you don't have enough atoms. Bethesda are absolutely taking the piss with their pricing and the worst part is idiots actually buy it.
---
In game, bring up the map&gt;menu&gt;settings&gt;menu
---
I dont get how any of these people justify this all because you can spend 2 months grinding the same thing for the past year now for something thats probably been cycled out the store by then.
---
Jesus you just gave them a great idea.
---
Shhhh dont give them ideas
---
&gt; I visit camps every day and some people are building gigantic buildings with crops, turrets, pianos, vending machines, Brahmin and sculptures, displayers and guest rooms.
---
We must sometimes visit the same camps but I can't figure out how the hell they fit it all in their camp budget.  I'm level 210-ish and by the time I've added the vending machines and crafting tables I feel like I've used 3/4 of my budget.
---
Thank you!
---
That would be amazing
---
I‚Äôd like bethesda to fix server stability first, then increase budget. Maxed out camps and more player structures contribute to a hefty amount of lag. Just try comparing a private server to a public one
---
there is also a card (woodchucker or something like that) = get more wood from......
---
its a good swap out card if you can afford it over another level up, but cant remember if its level specific
---
That's what I love about the game you can build to be  a dude in an impenetrable mech suit throwing an entire warships worth of ballistic rounds at what ever stands in your way or flip it and build to be a god damn shadow slipping threw an enemy camp and assassinating the ***legendary enemy(dick move btw) just like some badass ninja assassin 
---
It's your game play your way...love it
---
I mean....people still buy it so what deterrent is there to keep them from doing it?
---
Ive had this problem for about 6 months. Used to only be my legendary Lever Actions, now it is everything.
---
i think i have that card, just never thought about using it. ty!
---
I'm still waiting to see these awesome discounted prices for Fallout 1st members...
---
cheers
---
Yes, why is they?
---
Friends.
---
Lol why are defending your statement. Who cares if no one likes your comment. Have some tegridy ;)
---
I managed to get all the diseases but it won't give me credit for a SBQ kill.
---
Guns shouldn't think at all....hmmm wouldn't mind a legendary unique sentient laser weapon that would throw its 2cents in here and there though
---
Totally that bloody animation just appearing &amp; obscuring my vision when I'm in the middle of a fight gets me killed.
---
I hate this more than anything else in the game
---
You're welcome to your opinion. But the moment I said anything that didn't directly align with yours, you treated me like a shill. That's why I said to be an adult. You're entitled to your opinion but I'm not? 
---
And although I do agree there issues with the game, I personally don't see a problem with the price of the power armor skin.  It's a strictly cosmetic item not needed for the game.
---
18 dollars for blue :-p
---
The character death from a low-health condition is a result of radaway's connection with the hunger/thirst meter, and the hunger/thirst meter's connection to health and maximum health
---
So it's a combination of those two effects. Also correlation doesn't mean causation. Welcome to the party.
---
As a first subscriber, I hope they don't do this. That will mean you won't be able to carry your camp back and forth and will negate one of the benefits of the private world, which is to go on, build your base in private, then go back to a public server with it. If the build limit is increased on private worlds, you'll have to have different ones for each. I'd rather they make workshops and private worlds persistent (with resource gatherers that turn off when you leave the server to limit endless farming ) then you can build cool creations in the workshops and keep CAMPs the way they are.
---
No, you don't.
---
Bit of a late reply, but if you haven't seen the wallpaper yet it's just a basic grey type. xD
---
They did up the camp budget a bit too for non firsr memeber when first dropped. My camp budget was max full, after first dropped, i had like a 1/8 inch bigger budget.
---
It's okay because with fallout 1st you get 1600 atoms! oh...wait...
---
I could never fit through the gap :/
---
They do help stealth, but I find the benefit is not as high as say a piece of unyielding armor that gives you +3 agility.  I guess it would be something similar to adding +1 agility per weightless piece, or maybe 0.5 per ultralight mod.  Ultralight is more beneficial for creating a larger AP pool to use as a VATS character, but the weight saving effect is a nice benefit.  I have no datamined info to support this, just experience and in game experimentation.
---
If they sold stuff for prices that are easily grindable, then no one would need to buy atom packs. It sucks but it‚Äôs business
---
Sorry for the late reply, but yes you do. Two items can go on each shelf!
---
It didn't convey a sense of "Fallout". What does a flame burning things have to do with the fallout universe?
---
This would be the best way to handle it IMHO. Have a Bunker item entrance in the atom shop with a standard doorway. Sell different skins for it. It would then link to a fixed size build space underground in a separate load cell where you can build to your hearts content.
---
I got a refund, but to took a lot of emails back and forth. I did not get my alt unbanned, but they have banned a few other of my accounts that I do not test on, but do share the same email address, including my main.
---
WS is partially in the Forest and partially in the Savage Divide.
---
Source: Diseases. How long you are diseased depends on the region. If you catch a disease in the SD it lasts for idk 30mins, the same disease only last for 10mins in the Forest, if you had your disease for 10mins already and you enter the Forest you are cured immediately. I live a bit east of the mirelurk pond in WS, when I go west and get closer to the pond I'm often cured because I left the SD and entered the Forest.
---
I'm aware that they overcharged for the launch quality. I didn't like the situation, but it's not new either. From my view I've been overcharged many, many times by game devs, which is why for the last couple of years I sometimes pirate games to test them before buying. The games industry can be a real shitshow.
---
matter of interest, wot level is/was it .  92 or 98 (yes I know, but )
---
The communist baddies were under orders to blend in with the populace after the war, not display their garbage openly. It makes zero sense.
---
Step 1. Acquire Excavator PA
---
Step2. Go to Lucky Hole Mine and mine all the Lead Ores
---
Step3. Equip the scrapper perk and go to WestTek. Kill all super mutants and loot all assault rifles/miniguns/pipe guns/melee weapons. Scrap them for steel. Rinse and reest with server hopping
---
Step4. Either buy acid from other players, or get your own through Hemlock Holes workshop/farming crickets in Tanagra town. 
---
Step5. Get cloth from cups/trash at the amusement parks. Should be more than 100 at each.
---
Step6. Smelt the lead ores with acid. Make gunpowder with acid and cloth. Make ammo 
---
You can do this over and over and acquire a massive amount of ammo
---
Start a new game. Its pretty fun.
---
As stated above. $18 for a skin, when in the last Fallout game it cost $9 for an entire DLC. Yup, no problem here.
---
But the people who spend their hoarded atoms don't buy more, they complain that it's not easy to get more for free lol
---
Is it still alive? I could help.
---
So.... being BORED justifies using racial slurs in game chat?
---
Also i can lift more than you so i win automatically
---
Ya, I figured they would make you rebuild in adventure mode.
---
You're right but people don't want you to say it
---
6 months of testing to Bethesda is one day of testing to another studio. There are still BETA bugs in this game over a year after launch. Stuff still gets teleported to the roof if you build in a structure sometimes. I still take damage while running randomly. Enemies still t-pose and slide around on the ground and teleport to their spawn when they die. I've gotten a new xbox and the game still slows to an absolute crawl whenever I add or remove anything from my stash. I still load into the world under attack from invisible enemies and unable to move. Last time I played ~3 weeks ago I got stuck in my pip boy. It's a joke. The cosmetics are cool but they're milking us before they put the game to slaughter
---
Killing in style  &gt; killing in last months fashion
---
Get em hooked early, and they'll always come back for more.
---
I think they just dropped the budget cost on certain things. I don't think it was increased. Seems like they dropped weight on magazines and bobbleheads.
---
Yeah, the lag when you visit complex CAMPs is very real. Increasing the build at this point would have to go with reducing the number of people per server. Private worlds work so smoothly because they are limited to 8 people per server. If you had 24 on them, they'd behave just like regular ones.
---
1. I agree
---
2. This should be a boon for all remaining original beta or players at launch that have stayed with the game.
---
Well, that is sarisfactory to me as well.
---
The latest from Vault Tech R&amp;D designed to synch with VATs for better target identification, tracking, and response time. Capable of running several complex algorithms to determine individual threat levels and target priorities. A weapon that will do everything for you except pull the trigger!

---
Denying a requested upvote, that's a up votin
---
Preach! I love the counter argument to grinding: it'll take really long!
---
I grinded like 10 hours a day back in vanilla WoW to get my first epic mount.
---
Please do sod off lol
---
Not surprised... you ever play that other bethesda online game... the one with the real dark monetary system? The one with gambling and a extremely predatory monetization practices? You know... ESO? Elder Scrolls Online? Yeah after sampling that loot box, gambling, horseshit cosmetic show, I am not shocked by anything bethesda does... I mean never forget these are the same assholes who brought about the whole "horse armor" debacle and helped introduce microtransactions and "paid cosmetic DLC" into video games.
---
This is not the case. I have killed her solo, I still didn't get the "kill the SBQ" challenge marked as completed.
---
Yea I love the raider bots. I still laugh everytime when they call me a ...CHUMP!
---
They are good I think. I used alpha at 10 o‚Äôclock last night.
---
It's a status symbol, easy as that. Now shoo, dirty peasant.
---
Yup. They do need to up the budget though because all the new stuff offered in the atom shop leaves people with no room. More room=more sales.
---
I've been saving space for the remainder of the mounted heads if/when they get released.
---
" They're in this to make money, just like everyone else. "
---
Hey look guys the whole industry has become super greedy and is skinning its supporters alive. Welp I gues we should join then on that. - Some high up of Beth/Zenimax, maybe
---
Praising a company for not including loot boxes is like praising a cashier at your store for not stabbing you on the daily. It should never be there at the first place.
---
Seconding this. Especially if it is true that FO1st subscribers have more camp budget now and their camps don't shrink when they go to public servers. If they can have bigger camps even when they're on public servers, there's no excuse for the rest of us not to have more budget.
---
Oh yes .... 
---
plus ... have an announcement across the server that a dweller is attempting to disarm a rouge nuke and put the radius circle on the map.  Add some computer timer to add panic ... 
---
A prize for choosing right ... BIG BOOM when you chose wrong!   lol
---
Have I lost some 'tegridy now too :-(
---
All the sets are just skins for your character. Legendary just means the rarity of how often they put it up for sale.
---
What do they do?
---
You're pissy because you can't have ALL the new items? Really?
---
Battle pass isn't free
---
Salty\_Seaman got banned for cheating apparently. 
---
ThatBullGuy is Dope enjoy playing with him
---
AlChemical is deff up there 
---
US\_Marine\_Corp (or something like that) is also good.
---
Nothing :(
---
Then why are they in the game?
---
I don't care what you call your God.
---
But the effect is the same, as you see. Instead of upvotes like you asked/begged for, you got downvotes.
---
It's not true. Initiate is a deprecated paint plan that has no bearing on the current ones dropping. It's only if you learn the a plan higher than the others in the rank order that you can prevent them from dropping. I.e. if you buy and learn elder without getting the others, they'll never drop
---
Never mind, it‚Äôs Bethesda, they don‚Äôt make sense
---
And battle pass is a microtransaction. It isn't the actual game. The game itself is free.
---
Kids these day amirite?
---
I guess we shouldn't be surprised. Everything is all about instant gratification now.
---
Perhaps they could consider instanced locations off the main map where players could go crazy on their builds - issue is limited real estate so perhaps some sort of caps/resource sink could be introduced where you need to pay upkeep.
---
So long its not atoms, subscription locked service of course...
---
Not for the battle pass which is repurchased every few months.
---
What head?
---
Ive just stopped trying to shove everything into one camp, because its a camp. Its not a mansion. Lol. I mean dont get me wrong. I LOVE building. I personally made a few alternates so i could mess around with thier camps too. I started doing theme camps betwwen them all so it still works for me. Im not going to speculate on how "the devs intended it" because im not a dev. 
---
Just in my mind i see the word camp, and not settlement. I like that the game makes me pick and choose for everything.
---
I gave up on hitting them a while ago. You often have to hit them a couple times with melee weapons due to the lag and weird hit boxes and why waste bullets on them? You can lob a grenade, but then you still usually have to pop off a couple. It's just easier to click them all, though it was nice having the option to blow up a couple of them to speed up the process.
---
Give stuff like this to everyone, regardless of their subscription status, and I'll gladly buy the FO1st subscription.
---
Took it out 15secs ago.
---
While I don't approve of the prices of most things on the cash shop, it's really not about Bethesda of FO76. I would criticize them for the quality and pacing of atom shop updates for sure, but the silly digital pricing is a trend that has been established for MANY years by MANY different companies. I remember seeing WoW pets sold by Blizzard like 7-8 years ago that cost upwards of $15-20 CAD.
---
This is an industry-wide problem for the most part, and it's not going to change until the industry gets a serious shake-up as a whole. Not to say people shouldn't post about this here, but it's not going to make any difference to Bethesda. I don't know what could possibly cause real change to happen, but it seems pretty clear that these price points are considered effective by the powers that be, and they're going to keep trying to milk them because so many other companies are doing the same.
---
Combination of industry greed (though that's typical capitalist profit pursuit really) and whales with stupid amounts of disposable income, IMO.
---
Two shot explosive Gatling gun makes them fall apart in seconds.
---
Of course I‚Äôll upvote this! Why wouldn‚Äôt Bethesda listen to a post with 7 upvotes?
---
Figures. Just like getting stretched out from power armor. Have seen several people in the past week all deformed.
---
One thing I would love to see is more pre-built structures.  If they could lower the budget on a house I could place I could use more budget decorating and setting up crops,defenses, etc.
---
I would love to have a pre-built log cabin that is empty inside. Just have it wired up so all I have to do is connect my generator.  Then I could burn budget on cosmetic stuff.
---
Things like barns, churches, greenhouses,  cottages, mobile homes, log cabins, etc.
---
If you are on PC I can show you!
---
First they said no to pts a couple of months later they changed their mind. No date tho lol
---
I used to like the fallout games....  not so much anymore.
---
Well, yeah, they make everything fall apart lol. But not all of us want to lug one of those around. ;)
---
They didn't say when it would happen unfortunately, so 'soon' is a bit misleading. It could be months before we see any improvement.
---
Mine is reduced weight lol
---
I could definitely get on board with some cultist related content.  I always liked those strange, Lovecraftian places in previous Fallout games.  When Fo4 came out and BGS was asking for suggestions on their upcoming DLC, I suggested a trip to New Haven, Connecticut where Yale University is.  It's just a couple hours south of Boston, maybe less by vertibird.  The Skull and Bones Society would likely have gotten into some supernatural shenanigans after the bomb, or maybe had something to do with the formation of the Enclave.
---
Lucky Hole is a fantastic location in 76, and I'd like to see more done with it other than a place to mine lead out of.  Tanagra Town, while apparently a strangler vine infestation turned up to 11, also has a vaguely creepy feel and a bizarre giant head buried underneath it.  There's so much potential for a great questline with cultists and the creepy effigies scattered around Appalachia.
---
I fully expected more camp budget with FO1st. Very odd that it wasn't there as an incentive right away. 
---
I really, really hope they update that budget in the next few weeks, but it also seems unlikely.
---
Yeah but its not an operational mcdonalds. It serves no purpose, like all the other buildings with the same stuff in them.
---
I personally believe they are scared to touch any mechanic that is not a simple fix because when they touch something, it breaks something else. For instance, they did not do anything to affect mainframe cores in the recent update, however, it broke the ability to destroy mainframe cores with weapons. Proof ---&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIlgmH\_wXto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIlgmH_wXto) 
---
The problem is, if they touch some class or method, there is some other method that uses a method that uses a method that references the method you just changed, and it breaks something completly unrelated. This is why most companies do some sort of automated testing. They have just been hacking on an engine that is completly outdated. The technical debt is probably huge. I feel bad for the developers as I have worked with enormous technical debt before, and it is nearly impossible to make a change without breaking something else.
---
I hope they add this! I will grab it for sure. If they are waiting, that‚Äôs dumb. They should release all the holiday items at the beginning of the month so we can get the most out of it.
---
You're seeing the "low poly mode" animation. Same as ghouls you see from a distance, or assaultrons that slide along without their legs moving, or Gutsy's that bob along like a child's toy, or ghouls that slide along the floor.  
---
The game client hasn't registered you passing the "animation start" distance marker.
---
That's a great idea. I see them somewhat moving in that direction with the greenhouse &amp; bungalow but yea it would be cool if they went further &amp; had cabins and pre-fab structures.
---
To give a serious answer, the person that refuses to spend $18 on a cosmetic would likely also refuse to spend $5 on a cosmetic. Basically, you get the people willing to pay and milk them for what they're worth.
---
 Wow, Ty guys and ty for the gold! It's my first gold ever!!
---
Not a direct correlation when they give you up to 5 bucks a week to spend on such things.
---
Not to .mention it would add more of a faction theme to peoples camps. I would love having a responder bot that sells my stuff. You could load their inventory just like the machines. 
---
How awesome would it be to have the bots refuse to sell to people dressed in raider gear, or vice versa?
---
Budget should be set to where you are in my opinion. The reason for the budget is the rendering strain. If you are in an isolated area the strain should be less and you should get more budget.  Spread out people - quit building at the Whitespring.
---
There‚Äôs also a scarecrow costume, both of these, at least in my opinion look better than the pilgrim outfit that‚Äôs out now.
---
For the Lovecraftian entity, did you mean the Interloper body in the Lucky Hole Mine?
---
Like others say, I‚Äôm pretty sure they stack. Matter of fact, yesterday someone did a data mine post on sneaking stats! I know UNY/sneak is the most desired pieces on the market right now
---
I know you probably have a reason not to but there are private servers now if you want to completely negate the PvP thing but honestly if you keep pacifist mode on and stay away from workshops you‚Äôll never have any problems and don‚Äôt have to go to the expense of a private server.
---
I think the wendigo was Scoot Conroy.  Poor guy.
---
Right! If all the server has to do is remember 1 building we should theoretically be able to have more room for everything else since the game doesn't have to remember placement of foundations, walls,  roofs, etc.
---
I would buy a nice clean 2 story house in a hot minute.
---
lol
---
Salty doesn‚Äôt cheat. he‚Äôs just a good battle royal player. he didn‚Äôt get banned as far as i‚Äôm aware, just went to modern warfare ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Yea the possibility would be endless with these guys! I had never thought about it before but now I can‚Äôt help but think this should definitely be a thing! If we could have a scavenger bot, we should have a vendor bot.
---
I am assuming you are referring to excavator PA here. The bug is actually that it applies the additional carry weight bonus twice upon entering a world if you are wearing it. Dying or exiting resets this. So the bug is not dropping the 100 lbs, but adding it in the first place. I for one, do not want them to fix this.
---
You may have to uninstall and download again. Worked for me
---
thats not entirely true.  you are talking about a subset of people.  there is a separate subset that would buy atoms if the variables lined up correctly for them.  e.g. - if they ran out of atoms or were close to it, the prices were low enough for the shop and there was something worth spending money on.
---
If this weren't true, the system wouldnt exist
---
Grinding them at a rate of what, 580 atoms a week with abstract sometimes impossibly rng or hours of grind (alcohol challenges) just for a friggin recolor?
---
Sure, you CAN play any free mobile game and earn almost anything for free. Know what you cant do?
---
Add more hours to the day, because they bargain on unreasonable grind. Dont defend bethesda because you dont understand that their free ways to acquire atoms are still stingy by market standards.
---
Most players wouldn't buy them. They would spend atoms on them. It's not the same thing
---
Logged in last night:  Character Ate something, (probably hit enter two or three times since my hunger bar was empty):  immediately froze my client.  Again.  Eating / drinking has been freezing my client since roughly February, if not longer.  
---
Also, Increased Hunger and Hunger and Thirst from Speed Demon Mutation does not appear to benefit at all, or anywhere near enough, from the Class Freak 3 Perk.   The increased hunger and thirst from Speed Demon should be minimal wen it has a 75% reduction applied to it.    
---
Little while later, game instacrashed to my desktop.  Client stability is still pretty crappy.   I was on a private server the whole time I played.
---
You have to try and take the workshop to initiate combat.
---
We did get a plain grey square to cover the wall up this week. For free as well!
---
You can be killed in pacifist if you or a team mate own a workshop and someone contests it while you‚Äôre in the WS area. Or if you are at an unowned workshop and someone claims it they can attack you and initiate PvP if you are in the WS area when they are claiming it.
---
Haven‚Äôt you heard?  You can‚Äôt defend Bethesda here.
---
I plan to kill everything in the game at least once, I hate grind and rng loot drop, I see no point killing the queen 50 times to finally collect something, if that is what you are implying.
---
For instance one of my characters I saw a player vendor selling the white wolf fedora. From swappin stories with him I understand ot is a quest drop, I plan to eventually get to the quest but I like the way the hat looks with my tuxedo (bought with free atoms back around beta when i was testing the shop out). So I will buy a cosmetic, in this case from a player, to match some aesthetic When I am hanging around my camp cooking stuff.
---
Like I said before, I wanted to make a nuka girl, I am not a girl, but I like looking at them and the nuka girl look has some scifi campy bling to it. It also fits one of the perks in the game, and I would not mind trying to collect all the nukas in the game world and sell extras to players like a soda fountain for kicks. Roleplay with effects on how I play the game, not really a trophy or accomplishment.
---
I mean this is a sandbox game, half the fun is from playing with it like a toy, building camps just to see them like legos. 
---
I get playing for a challenge and like I said I want to get theough as much content as I can. I hate playing for grind reasons, I prefer selling cosmetics over slot machine loot boxes for instance. I hate farming hoping for a legendary drop, I do a quest once or twice, maybe more frequently if I am with a group of players who want to do it, then I am done with it.
---
For instance my current player is specializing in pipe weapons. I know they are a joke and I will need to swap into a different perk set for playing higher level content (or make another character), but I like roleplaying as a scavenger/explorer and it fits in my head.
---
Your point is invalid as you cast off all naysayers simply because its earnable in game technically, while not addressing the fact that the alternate method of obtaining these items is ludicrously grindy and obtuse.
---
Don't be all "bruh wdym just get gud"
---
Oh no. Bethesda did something people have been asking for for awhile now. How dare those people that have been repeatedly asking Bethesda to "please change this" follow up that request with a "thank you" when Bethesda finally listens to them. Oh how awful. I just might die from the sheer terror of it all.
---
*sarcasm drug wears off*
---
Hey, Bethesda thanks for rolling back the intro screen to one that played when I still thought you all knew better than to lock quality of life stuff behind a subscription.
---
Also thank you for the wallpaper. Considering I don't plan on changing my "have a day" icon any time soon, the free icons were nice and all, but getting pointless. I will definitely use the shit out of the new wallpaper though. 
---
Also what were you smoking when you thought a power armor skin should potentially cost someone eighteen actual, real life dollars?! Because what ever it is that you were smoking, I don't want it!
---
Or...you know you could just make a game fun and please your fans by offering cosmetics through in game quests and challenges as incentive to and thanks to the fan base...oh wait I'm in 2019 my bad
---
You either grind or you pay. Its video games now. I wasnt defending Bethesda.
---
Halloween event was pretty bad ass imo. Sure I'd love to see a lot more.
---
yes that's right
---
That confirms someone was trying to meet and scam meet out of my 1500 acid
---
It's because of the in game rewards. They need to remove all of that and then slash all atom shop prices by 75%
---
Fo1st members don‚Äôt have more camp budget. Actually after the last update I seem to have lost some because I was able to store food in my fridges and now it tells me I am at max budget ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I should head over to filthy casuals huh?
---
Im moving over to Red Dead for awhile
---
Thanks for the kicks,Todd
---
Why did you buy the retexture instead of the original?
---
The argument makes no sense here. An epic mount was not purchasable from blizzard in Vanilla.
---
Compare digital apples to digital apples please.
---
ok boomer
---
Most players will never spend money on atoms, only farm them. There are some who will buy a bundle or two if they like the freebies. But the type of player they're wanting is someone who wants to throw money down on anything because they want to look awesome in a game they play regularly. That's who this current system is made for, earning the atoms only prevents the first two groups from being alienated
---
That‚Äôs low man, I hope he didn‚Äôt get you.
---
Cant buy the BOS PA paints in the atomic shop. Should I be mad that I cant and you grinders get something that I cant? Lol
---
Exactly, my stories are not about leaderboard, it is a character driven story that is often sub-optimal play. As a math and software nerd I could figure out the best play style to power level and max whatever trophy stat I could think of, but that is my day job. To me the game is escapist fun.
---
The things that get me irate is when they mess up game mechanics to try and force me into pay to win. I think the scrap and weapon repair kits are an abomination that instead means the in game repair mechanism should work realistically and simpler.
---
i want a bigger base budget quite badly and have since release but **PLEASE do NOT tie it to private servers** (or a paid feature.)
---
Your missing the mark.  The live service they were talking about is the atom shop not the actual game
---
Hello! We have an update to share on this issue and more generally on upcoming fixes in future patches.
---
We‚Äôve been working to address a large list of issues across all areas of the game in our upcoming Wastelanders update, including many of the community‚Äôs most-requested bug fixes, like the +250 DR legendary effect issue.
---
Right now, we‚Äôre looking to pull some of these community reported bugs, including this one, into an earlier patch. However, we need to be sure we can do this safely, without creating new issues where there weren‚Äôt any before. We know this one is a priority for the community, and we‚Äôll share more firm details with you on timing as soon as that's locked in.
---
I make happy meals lol Burgers, drink, sweet and even a toy. It‚Äôs definitely a operational McDonald‚Äôs
---
Realism would consider the alternative and realize that what it demands is unreasonable even for someone with too much time on their hands.
---
I dont understand the complex that requires you to label anyone who disagrees with you as not an adult.
---
It was a she, luckily I had it hidden in my F 1st camp a few metres away, but she wouldn't follow me out of the workshop. I also saw someone sneaking to claim it as I met her
---
Bring some fertilizer &amp; TP instead
---
Imagine defending this practice.
---
If your still playing this game and buying g shit from the atom shop that means your a hardcore fan.  So why in the world are you arguing against playing more kf the game your a hardcore fan of? Would you enjoy a "beat game and get all legendaries and max level" purchase so you could not play the game more?
---
&gt;makes 
---
 made\* . Does nothing now.
---
95? Either way it was in its 90's
---
Thank you for the update!
---
Whales spending &gt; average person spending.
---
Please do calculate the amount of time and dedication it would require to reach the full 560 or so atoms you would earn each week, and then factor them into requesting a player spend 1800 atoms on a recolor that contains less than its initial release.
---
Yes, thanks.
---
Yep. A friend and I timed it once. Loading it beside each other, he was able to move 8-10 seconds before I could. 
---
Oddly, running on a different PS4 (newer) seems to have changed this for me and we load in about the same time now.
---
That's not changing the price, and clearly they don't just "give" you anything.
---
Buddy.
---
Yes, it is a standard for me to expect the company to do its fucking job and deliver at least acceptable products before they attempt to milk it with outrageous prices on lazy cosmetics that exceed the price of the game itself. Dont "this generation" me, you sound like a boomer. Im in the game design business myself so yes, these are standards for game development that for some reason people are letting big companies, that should set an example, break for easy money cuz "oh whatever its optional". With that attitude they will never fix this game cuz dipshits like you guys just accept this bullshit
---
Fair play I heard people running a similar scam a few months back where they join your team to trade, the check you have the stuff and then come out of the trade menu and hit their buddy waiting in the shadows therefore allowing him to attack you and anyone else on your team. Just got stay one step ahead of the scammers üëç

The trick is that YOU need to be at the fissure. You can tag a legendary on the other side of the map,travel to a fissure,then have you friend or anyone kill the legendary,and it will count.
---
Some of the stuff that Bethesda doesn't do just kinda baffles me. This is the type of thing they could sell people that wouldn't anger everyone. Instead of having a collector bot as a utility item they should have done this. A robot vendor offers absolutely no ingame advantage.  Just my 2 caps
---
Hilarious, I'm finishing up a build at the exact same place right now! I love listening to Murgle mew and meow at me while I'm constructing things. Bethesda really needs to add personal pets to this game because it feels so much comfier with a friend. xD  
---
Btw, nice job on the extra vending counters. They look great!
---
Lol! Git yerself sum tegridy!
---
You need to do proper comparisons. I've branded for weeks for the "the insane" title in world of warcraft. But you cant purchase that title.
---
As a first subscriber, I say yes. It should be available to everyone for free.
---
Who said I was defending it?  It's just video games in general now. Dont like it? Move onto another hobby.   It doesnt irk me enough to quit but I do think its shitty.
---
Yeah, I am afraid your right. Although I never had this issue when the UK or the UAE when I was based there. Thanks for taking the time to reply though! üòÉ
---
You dropped this: /s
---
Just because Bethesda is arguably better than EA doesn't mean that what they do is always okay.
---
&gt;They're in this to make money, just like everyone else.
---
In that case, move the scrap box and forward tent out from behind the pay wall and, as I've said many times before, I will gladly pay for the FO1st subscription and defend the ever living fuck out of it as well. I'll also go back to buying those Atom Shop bundles that have the outfit included.
---
I can build a fusion generator and some water pumps If you're on PC and want help.
---
How's he meant to buy the original when it's not in the shop
---
1800 atoms is weeks of work **for a power-armor paint skin** a retexture of a previous 18$ skin I might add.
---
This.
---
At a low level if you have the stash space pop a rad x then collect 100 plus from a river/pond. Then pop one radaway and you should have enoigh water for your cooking to last a couple days.
---
Once you find the water purifier following the overseer quest line you just leave it at your camp and will have all the pure water you will need.
---
I wait too. Also because 90% of things come back at a discounted rate. At least for a day usually.
---
IF you are playing with a friend, but if you‚Äôre solo, you can just go down to fissure prime and most of the time you‚Äôll get a legendary Scorchbeast.
---
Funny, I can use my 3 star death claw and kill him easy but I cannot PVP 
---
(nor do I want to)
---
Anyone can make that. Its not a prerequisite to have a mcdonalds or a resturant even.
---
Oh I just meant when it was in the shop.
---
Check my post history. I have a similar post from yesterday. Bethesda directly responded to it this morning with an update in big fixes
---
A team of two can kill you if one member leaves party and initiates a takeover. The owner can then kill anyone, including you inside the zone.
---
It's been happening for several days now
---
It's just a power armor paint job microtransaction, Michael. What could it cost? $18?
---
Had a lvl 23 walk up to me yesterday, he was new to the game and I gave him some stuff to help him on his way. He asked about a lot of the game mechanics. Nice chap from russia.
---
He saw all my crap at my camp and went "damn you must be rich", to which i could only reply "not really, I just played for a year"
---
Omg. Beth replied to this!
---
I genuinely think the Fo76 team/Bethesda is running out of funding. So out of desparation they're trying to wring as much money out of the people still willing to give them anything.
---
You struck a nerve. Your blatant ignorance and stupidity triggered 150+ people.
---
&gt;Don't understand it, just plain greed.
---
What's not to understand, this is Bethesda, one of the many greedy shit AAA publishers that are vultures only after your money. It's completely in character for them to do that shit
---
They need the cash.  There are no platforms left to release Skyrim on.
---
I cant say for sure, but it's considered unarmed so it should. Sorry I cant confirm. üòñ
---
Yes, as the value atoms alone are discounted enough to buy the year sub. Its why I did it. I was already paying full price for atoms monthly, so its saving me money and I got some nice bonuses. The scarpbox is a gamechanger and should be available to everyone by default.
---
For me its my fried with the new vault 94 power armor with any automatic weapons, locks up most everyone around as well.
---
He didn't say it was useful bucko, he said it wasn't cosmetic. This is the part you say its "practically"  cosmetic.
---
what bullshit? its a bloody additional cosmetic. don‚Äôt be obtuse.
---
Good to know. I wasn't finding anything direct from Bethesda about increased camp budget for the subscribers, but with all the people here posting about it, I was beginning to wonder if it really was something made up by those people to make the subscription look even worse than it looks to a lot of us now or if they genuinely were being just that much more "oh hey, let's pay wall this quality of life thing as well!"
---
It sure is now! Would i buy it? No. Would i buy the 1800 PA? No.
---
Would i get it when it's on sale? Maybe!
---
Were speaking of video games. I'm not going to bother going into thesis level detail here. If you cant get a general statement from what I'm saying then...
---
When the other player does what he described, pacifist doesn‚Äôt matter, the game thinks he either initiated it or was responding to it when the other player jumped in front of him to shield the mole miner
---
In one of the pictures of the thanksgiving table there was a board game in the center of the table. Does this table allow us to display a center piece?
---
Its 2001 again huh
---
I wish they would lol.
---
Earning these is possibly more grindy than a full set of raid gear for those who only have daily and weekly atom challenges left.
---
But nah its these friggin millenials who dont want to work /s
---
I'd buy more cosmetics in the Atom Shop if Bethesda actually finished this game.
---
How could I have been so stupid.
---
if you switch already loaded guns fast several times, they go unloaded and you have to reload them. but if you slowly switch to other guns, they go back to being loaded again :D
---
I dunno, I've spent thousands of atoms but only bought about 3k with the pint sized slasher bundle and one month of F1st. I would have to actually look at my atom shop, I might go and look at the (owned) page and upload a few pics to post here so we can figure out the math together. But I've played 1600 hours so I don't expect everyone to have that kind of time to grind atoms
---
Bethesda: Limited time skin
---
Defenders: GrInd uR aTOmS pLeb
---
Either way, I've never gotten any love from that quest. Water bottles and a few rounds of 5.56.
---
*DISCLAIMER:  This is not a defense of Fallout 1st nor is it a recommendation to buy it. Hell no.  Just want to get that straight before getting to the point.* 
---
I think the idea is to get you to subscribe to Fallout first.   If you subscribe to Fallout 1st you get 1600 atoms per month. If you don't spend like a drunken sailor and you are very picky about what you spend atoms on, over the course of 2-6 months those atoms add up and then suddenly 1800 caps isn't a big deal.  Some would argue that this is a sleazy business practice and I'd say that they are not wrong.  But it is what it is.
---
This comment is pure deflection, in no way do you justify the price point, and the fact that you don‚Äôt even include an estimate on how many atoms can reasonably be earned in a week, your entire premise is null.
---
This is reddit. If (not including myself) intellectual discourse is the theme, perhaps look elsewhere to complain that internet people are lazy?
---
PvP and PvE are very different. The damage cap now makes melee nearly useless as well. Used to be bloodied melee could 1-shot anyone but the cap eliminates that and most melee guys get gunned down in VATS or Tesla'd to death before they even get close.
---
I can't help but notice this patch took the premium, 100$ a year scrap box, and are just now giving it the basic features other storage containers have... A month after it came out.
---
Cup holders
---
Smh...
---
Really don't get all the Bethesda haters.
---
Any publicity is good publicity in their eyes.
---
You should just rage quit and stop promoting their products.
---
Good advice here, but one more thing..
---
Remember that enemies, even ranged enemies, will come to you if they can't get line of sight. If you get destroyed running up, stop running up. Make them bottle neck at a doorway or something, hide behind trees, use the terrain. Be smarter than the AI.
---
Eventually you can run right at them and smack them, but until you can you shouldn't let them get a shot off at you if you can help it.
---
Someone posted data mined info showing that chameleon doesnt buff your sneak. It only creates a stealth field, which is apparently useless with pve.
---
Didn't have the atoms back then...
---
People love faction stuff, me included. It's beyond me why they don't and commendation challeges and quests that award you these. Make it just like the pioneer scout machines.  They could put tons of awesome stuff inside that you could work for and later spend your commendations on. Things like camp cosmetics (signs, decals, flags, weapon skins, etc) and even a vendor robot that is the faction version. The possibilities are endless tbh. Once you finish one faction line you could try the other 9nes.
---
I wasnt arguing against playing more.
---
I usually complete three or four out of five weeklies, and do at least one daily. I've got 1600 hours and play every day though. I didn't know I had to bring in math. I'll be posting all of my owned items from the atom shop soon, but I've only ever bought one bundle and the subscription so we can go over the math together, friend
---
He's not wrong?
---
Not sure why you‚Äôre being downvoted, you‚Äôre 100% right, they are designing this game for whales and whales exclusively. And it will only escalate. I made a similar comment and also got downvoted, idk if it‚Äôs paid Zenimax PR accounts downvoting us or just uninformed, moronic fanboys, either way it‚Äôs garbage lol
---
Pay wall more camp budget? Because if so, I'm going to have to respectfully disagree. Pay walling quality of life stuff is the exact reason why I haven't signed up for the subscription and why I stopped buying atoms. I'd happily get the subscription, even defend the subscription, and go back to buying atoms (specifically the outfit bundles) if they took the quality of life stuff out from behind the pay wall.
---
I liked the ranger armor for the charm of having it open like that at the bottom, now it looks too generic, hopefully they revert it or a mod adds the old model.
---
i think the price on the new display shelf is good but the tabels and chairs and the POWER ARMOR FUCK THAT IM NOT PAYING 20$ for all that
---
Yeah, I think the fix on _ was really good too!
---
The mods for the backpack. High Cap I find useful as well as the reefer mod. Situation determines which one I use. Reefer mod is epic for Flux farming imo.
---
I can add its rare to see a patch where so many of fixes done are so equally important and needed.
---
I've had a lot of fun working through them tbh. I wish they would add more ranks and badges to earn.
---
&gt;The prices are silly. I would buy all the power armor skin packs if they were maybe 200 -400 atoms each but will not buy one if it is 1200-1800.
---
I wish Bethesda would read this and take it into serious consideration. Ask someone to spend 1800 atoms on one suit and they cringe. Ask them to pay 200 atoms for a skin, they think hey that's cheap and pretty soon they are buying skins right and left and over time it adds up, Before you know it, that person who refused to pay 1800 atoms for one skin has spent 4000 atoms over the course of a few months buy buying "cheap" skins.
---
I just meant getting more of anything for the subscription I am paying for would be a plus lol.
---
Yeah, we've been discussing this since yesterday lol. Bethesda is responding to peoples posts and providing updates on their plan of attack.
---
I've grinded WF overseer 100 and WF solo expert vault raid.
---
Please dont use play time as a way to dismiss others. Every opinion counts.
---
But the atom shop prices are particularly abysmal. Coupled with a lack of engaging content and none to be seen on the near horizon and insanely stingy alternative ways to reward it, bethesda knows they will get folks money.
---
That would lose them money? That's a terrible idea from a marketing standpoint. Or from any standpoint really.
---
&gt;I‚Äôd like bethesda to fix server stability first, then increase budget.
---
Yup.
---
&gt;Maxed out camps and more player structures contribute to a hefty amount of lag. Just try comparing a private server to a public one
---
Every time someone says the FO1st subscription doesn't pay wall server stability, a scorchbeast gets its wings.
---
I saw someone on a similar post say no you cannot.
---
Totally missed that. Thanks!
---
Personally I stopped after getting the backpack.  CBA doing the other stuff as it feels like a lotta grind for little return
---
To follow up on /u/LadyDevann‚Äôs earlier comment, the fix for the jet pack issue is part of a large list of bug fixes currently slated for release with our Wastelanders update. We know that fixing the jet pack bug is important to the community, and we are working to move the fix into our December patch instead so that it can go out sooner. We will let you know as soon as we have confirmed the timing on this one.
---
Must depend on the players personality, I hate crosswords and puzzles and find these badges so tedious, ho hum.
---
A nice counter they already have in game would be nice too.
---
Lmao, people that tolerate such incompetence and scummy behaviour from big companies are the reason they all went to shit. I bet you think the whole Fallout 1st or the Fallout 76 Preoder Bag or the Rum scams were just optional things so its also fine and no need to call them out on that. Just sad.
---
If on PC, check out the Better Inventory Mod.  It will tell you how much each inventory tab in your pipboy weighs.  It also tells you how much a stack of something weighs.  Unfortunately it does not work on stashes so you'd have to pull everything out, figure out what weighs to much, and put everything you want to keep back.
---
\#Nerfedupdates
---
You may need to change your build if you cannot kill a single deathclaw.
---
Animated sprite of some flies causing server instability. I see you are an industry professional.
---
They are a hassle sometimes but I am on a mission to get them all. Now if I could just get that damn plasma grenade plan.....lol
---
That's how I feel, I'm doing bits of them but boy all the travelling and finding this doing that get hard to enjoy for me.
---
He can't initiate or respond to attacks when pacifist is on.
---
I missed that too, awesome
---
Most of my guns do this when loading into a new server. Has been doing it for a while now.
---
Well, someone must be buying it üëÄ
---
Go to the lumbermill just south of Vault 76 with woodchucker card in......200 plus wood in 5 minutes...look out for the ticks though...the purifier is best though
---
Wasn't using time to dismiss others, was using it to dismiss what I said lol. That last bit makes me think that they won't get money, just less log-ins. Until recently farming atoms was all there was to do in this game, so that's where my time went
---
I just put a flowerpot and a vault boy standee on one. The hard part was FINDING the table (hint: it‚Äôs on the same tab as the West Virginia tables).
---
I've read here how hard that is to get to drop, good luck.
---
Well, I personally don‚Äôt care much for the backpack mods, but they are a valuable trading commodity. So you can always grind them to get stuff to help trading for something you want
---
Haha. Is there a handcuff on the severed arm? I can‚Äôt tell.
---
Bethesda: "stash space reduced to 50lbs, we've added 3 different scrapboxes (ammo, junk and aid) to the Atomic Shop for 5000 Atoms each."
---
I see you're a forum asshole. This is why I posed it as a question as I am not sure how it would if at all affect the server stability.
---
A) That's a terribly exaggerated, irrelevant analogy.
---
B) This is just where the market is at. They need to generate similar revenue to stay competitive, otherwise developers leave and go where the money is better. Then production suffers, more money is lost... see where that's going? Just because you want everything handed to you fir free doesn't mean it will be, and getting all flustered over it isn't going to fix your problem; understanding that no one owes you anything will though.
---
You mean build a backpack mod it and then the the whole thing?
---
I know you mean this as a joke, but if enough of my friends played, I'd half consider spending the atoms for this.  It's a better use of atoms than on a paint job, and you'll have a chance at a legendary and some masks.
---
If you do think its shitty, why defend them? You tell others to move on despite being passionate about 76 and caring about it but wanting it to do better, but your response is to shame people for wanting it to despite sharing the opinion?
---
oh wow, they added additional PA skins and are charging for it, oh wow the incompetence and scumminess! oh lord save us from the incompetence and scumminess of the creation of additional optional cosmetics in the store! 
---
you‚Äôre a fool, plain and simple. pls cry more
---
Armor-plated is plus 90 damage resist. That‚Äôs nothing to scoff at. :)
---
Wait. There‚Äôs a reefer mod?? :)
---
I don't think so, but I'm not sure yet. ü§î
---
But ask yourself whether or not it's fair to try and wring everything out of you while not producing content for you?
---
sometimes the flies are all you can see
---
It would change the meaning of "shit show" if they did an AMA but I'd like it
---
If power armor skins were like 5 bucks I could definitely see it maybe 10 for some really cool ones then I would buy one or two and I think a lot of other people would as well. But year 18$ is waaaay too much
---
Not having loot boxes is a pretty low bar to measure them on.
---
You're saying it's OK to release a game that is essentially still in beta (at the very least, it's unfinished) without telling consumers AND charging $60 for said game?
---
You think it's OK for a game that launched as broken as 76 to go a full year with virtually no major technical or performance improvements?
---
You think it's OK to use a 10+ year old engine, knowing it can't handle the game that they're trying to make on it?
---
You think it's OK to be pushing microtransactions and subscriptions so hard, instead of busting their ass on fixing the game?
---
You think it's OK for said subscription to be full of highly requested community features, so adding another paywall to a broken game for features we should already have anyway?
---
@ -167 points on your comment I guess you didn't ü§£
---
No the plans themselves
---
I have way less free atoms than I have free cash to spend and I haven't got much free cash, so that'll tell you just how little atoms I have (140 at the moment, to be exact). If you've got enough atoms to pay for a FO1st subscription every month, then I envy you very much.
---
No get the plans and sell those. You can‚Äôt sell backpacks, but high capacity mods go for like 30k caps.
---
I disagree but apart from anything this is just a game lol, I have built all the boring things like houses plenty time and know like pushing myself to see what I can come up with with what I have. I find it fun and so do a lot of people, so it‚Äôs not pointless or flawed. If I was to somehow force u to build something interesting that would obviously be pointless less, but I can‚Äôt do that and nor would I want to if I could, I just want to share what I find fun amongst other people that find it fun, and have fun together. That is definitely not pointless üòä
---
Harder To Detect most definitely stacks.  However, like most other things in the game, it seems to be a system of diminishing returns where you can never quite reach 100%.  
---
If you want to build a ninja, you can never be too sneaky, right?  In an ideal situation, I'd say a full suit of uny/str/sneak armor is the pinnacle.  It's going to be expensive to acquire, so I hope you have some j/vats and b/e weapons laying around to trade.  For the sake of utility, I'd probably add at least one uny/poison/sentinel or cavalier piece.  Ever since Vault 94 opened up, poison can be really dangerous for a low health build.  Sentinel and cavalier effects don't seem to work while crouched, otherwise I'd say add maybe one or two harder to detect armor pieces and leave the rest sentinel.
---
Your agility score is going to have the largest effect on your ability to sneak after stealth perks.  If you want to stay in caution for that 3x multiplier while punching the SBQ, one shotting sheepsquatch or tearing through West Tek, you'll want at least a score of 30.  Upper 30's is even better.  Your agility is just as important to your DPS as your strength is, maybe even moreso.  3x sneak attack damage is pretty significant.  In my opinion, anything less than 12 is a questionable build.  15 is easy to fill up with adrenaline/escape artist/sneak/ninja/dodgy.
---
Sneak and Covert Operative perks are must have for any stealth build.  Covert Operative makes you much more quiet while moving at normal sneak speed, and its pretty obvious why that would be important for a melee character.  The sneak to lose enemies is a bit misleading.  You can't be in active combat and expect this to engage.  How it works is it will allow you to get back into hidden mode quicker if you're in broad caution.  When it says "running", it really means moving normally in stealth as opposed to pressing caps lock to engage the slower/encumbered "walking" speed.
---
I have three different stealth characters, so I'm pretty familiar with how all of it works from an in game perspective.  It's up to you if you want to try out anything I say or discard it.
---
Cosmetic mxt and Mxt that are taken from the game and sold instead of put inside the game organically I paying to not play the game
---
I hope I get voted down for this. You fuckers complain and complain about paying for Fo76 items. I would bet money none of you fill your vendors with stuff at 0 caps. Selling those legendary weapons for 20,000 caps, armor at 7000 caps. Stable flux at 200-500 caps. Plans for spicy mod starting at 5000 caps. Going on those eBay sites selling that bloodied 3 star exploding handmade for $27-$40 USD. Getting price checks on that AAFFRRD you got for merely shooting a legendary Super Mutant. Shut the hell up. Bethesda sees that shit on here. And you expect them to sympathize with your financial system when you will shove 12 inches of dick up a fellow vault dweller‚Äôs ass and not lose a second of sleep and wake up in the morning and be able to look yourself in the face in the mirror? Self centered idiots.
---
Oh understand, I've never seen any backpack plans in vending machines so they must get snapped up really fast.
---
I don't even remember that, but oh the drama. Guess I need to play through the old games, or at least browse through their wikis to refresh my memory.
---
Imagine playing FO1 or FO2 but with the current game engine. Same NPCs, same story, same perks and rules. It would be quite something.
---
I'm not defending it. It's the status quo nowadays. You either sit and eat the shit or you leave.  I'm choosing to eat this particular games shit because it's still fun for me.  I dropped gears 5 really quickly because I couldn't stomach its shit.  I'm not shaming anyone.
---
Yep, i'd buy more items from the atomic shop because there are some really good ones. But 18‚Ç¨ for a skin... Cmon
---
Someone's buying it...and not enough people are complaining/voting with their wallets...so Bethesda's going to keep selling $18 skins...
---
I subscribed to FO1st for the scrap box and no other reason.  I am only going to pay for one month and i'm loading up that box with all that I possibly can before I lose access to it.  
---
The private worlds are ok.  I like that they aren't as laggy and they seem to have higher legendary spawn rates (this is gut feeling...no actual research has been done to confirm or deny this feeling) but I tend to stay on public servers because I try to buy and sell stuff.  I'm not usually very successful but I do try.
---
The atoms are nice I suppose but I'm not spending enough of them to care how many I have.
---
The camp might be nice enough but I forget it's there most of the time.  The free fast travel is pointless as travelling from one corner of the map to the other is cheap enough it doesn't even register to me I'm spending caps.
---
The emotes and armor are worthless.
---
Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan and Dylan.
---
They're not trying to wring everything out of me, like I said I bought one bundle besides the sub. I am not the targeted demographic for the atom shop. Even still, I farm atoms as much I can and have managed to buy a great deal of things from there
---
üòÆ so there's a good reason right there to grind badges, thanks.
---
I know :/ I've noticed on console that when you look in the direction of a bunch of meat piles the frame rate drops to around 10-15 fps. and it gets very stutter. 
---
Turn around and look away and the frame rate stabilizes and goes back to normal.
---
I think some auto correct messed up the last bit of your sentence. I'm not sure what you were saying at the end there :-(
---
Depends on what you're doing.
---
**Mining/Scavenging:** Excavator.  
---
**Nuke zone:** X-01.  
---
**Adventuring:** T-51b.  
---
That's really it. Calibrated Shocks are hands-down the best leg mods there are. For the helmet, a lot of people love the Targeting HUD, but I'd say give Recon Sensors a shot; I find those pips MUCH easier to track than the targeting HUD highlights. Chest, I'd say Emergency Protocols for that extra tankiness at low health, but Jetpack might also be good again when they fix that stupid bug.
---
So I need to get ALL the badges, I think I better do some searching and learn how this works, may give me an incentive to grind them badges. Cheers.
---
&gt;For me the private world has been worth the price of admission. Not so much for how it changes the game, which it does so dramatically, but because it runs so much more stable now that I do not feel the bugs damage my gameplay as much.
---
The thing is that no other game asks me to pay for server stability. Because they know their customers shouldn't have to pay extra per month for a stable game. That's what irritates me the most about this subscription, even more so than the pay walled quality of life stuff.
---
If you understood the time invested component of everyone else statements you would realize Bethesda is invalidating the "grind" component by making it incredibly unreasonable so all that's left is "or pay"
---
There are better systems of the same design that better reward grind while still drawing similar revenue.
---
are you dylan by any chance?
---
My Quad Pump Shotgun's noticed it, but none of my other guns are affected.
---
Really annoying to have to reload 32 rounds everytime I log in or crash.
---
You dont get any downvotes! Heres a report for you &lt;:
---
Be right back. Finding tomatoes to throw.
---
They definitely presented their response overly sarcastically, but the flies themselves are 2D sprites and would have very minimal impact to frame rate stability regardless of platform.
---
Build up of meat piles doesn't help, but the biggest impact is from the more polygon dense models for player weapons/armor/clothing when many congregate in the rendered area for an event.
---
Oh wow, the incompetence and scummy behavior! They created an additional optional cosmetic skin for PA. And they are charging for it? OH LORD SAVE US FROM the INCOMPETENCE! How could they do that? Pay developers to make fun skins for people who choose to grind atoms or buy them, oh lord the incompetence! 
---
You are clearly someone who is going to hate for any reason possible, even stretching scenario's like a company creating and selling skins as incompetent. Get a grip. You're a fool plain and simple if you believe your own bullshit at this point.
---
Yeah I got question...
---
Did you know you can save 15% or more by switching to Geico?
---
They rotate the free weekly items. Next week it will be something different.
---
Thank you. Finally someone not scared to say that the player base are hypocritical.
---
You only need 5 badges for most of the mods. You‚Äôll need 8 for the fridge and high capacity ones though, I believe.
---
I would say there is actually a pay to win category and its not the scraptron. Its anything you can wear in NW that helps you hide. 
---
Items won in NW are dayglo orange, like wearing a bullseye. But buy something brown or dark and you get the benefit of camouflage.
---
A) it is very relevant when you understand it was meant to show that people become gradually compliant with the BS game devs put in their products. Slowly but surely people accept it and something that would otherwise would be unthinkable is now standard.
---
Check some early 20th century history for examples how things changed gradually or if there was a good reason enough to make it happen faster. I mean both economics and politics.
---
B) If they mismanage their company, why do we have to pay for it? We are customers, not shareholders. I dont give half a damn if a company is not performing due to poor management or otherwise. I will most certainly not share a tear over a company that turns to predatory practice and overmonetization to cover their mistakes.
---
I only wonder why do you feel like defending a multi-billion dollar corporation. If anything you should demand a good product at a fair price.
---
Are we allowed to name people like this?
---
I didnt, thanks for the information
---
In the atom shop, it \*just\* comes as a table. 90% certain that centerpiece (the dehydrator) doesnt even exist yet, but maybe they'll release more options with the Turkey outfit.
---
Have an upvote for... hell, just making me laugh.
---
The loot boxes are an example of something that isn't a part of this game. Yet. It's an industry standard currently though, so I wouldn't be surprised if it eventually appeared in some form.
---
It's an always online service, as long as there is still new content being developed, then it will never be complete. Most other games of the same genre have a similar price point, so that argument is completely invalid.
---
It really wasn't that broken; the engine is buggy, and old yes, but it was still a functional, enjoyable game. Moat of the controversy came from the stupid back pack thing, not from actual game performance. Some people over exaggerated the depth of the issues. It's like n0ne of you have ever picked up a Bethesda title before...
---
They aren't pushing anything. Are there microtransactions? Yup. Are you being forced to buy them? Not at all. If anything a lot of this outrage feels like jealousy, and entitlement. Just because you want something someone else has, and you want it really really badly, doesn't mean you deserve to have it for free.
---
If anyone thought private servers were going to be free, then you were just being naive. As far as the scrap box, I've seen that asked for, and it was typically associated with the subscription that exists in ESO. Most of the time when I saw the two mentioned together, everyone was A okay with a subscription coming with it.
---
Moral of the story: get over yourself. You aren't entitled to anything and no one cares that you're upset.
---
"I hope I get voted down for this" 
---
You got it!
---
You can always run full out noob toob. Frog legs, grenadier, and demolition expert. 
---
Learn where bobble heads heads spawn, and hope for an explosive bobble. Check yellow crates from M79's and/or hack terminals for an auto-launcher.
---
You can down an entire team if you catch them clustered.
---
If you want to focus on autos, I run the following:
---
Ground pounder (+hip fire accuracy, 30% faster reload)
---
Master commando
---
Tank killer (40% AP)
---
Tenderizer (20% dmg buff after 1st hit)
---
Frog legs
---
Pharma farma (psycho, med-x, stims)
---
Bloody mess (15% dmg+)
---
Base dmg on a handmade is 73 per hit, with the 2nd+ being 87 dmg. You can down them in 3-6 hits, just focus on their head.
---
We all know this isn't true.  The game is far to stable for this theory.
---
I see. So why does my frame rate sky rocket when I look away?
---
It does it when I'm alone in a private server as well by the way.
---
Meh, fair point, lashed out too much and I wont pretend I know what I am talking about lol. No idea why you got downvoted, only fair to defend yourself.
---
Agreed. If a game Like Monster Hunter World can have them, we should be able to have them in this game too. 
---
Also, let us display our pirate hats!!!!
---
Praising them is fine. But the level of praise is the issues. There's so many actually issues with this game. Performance issues. Technical issues. Bugs. Glitches. Yea it's cool to have the old intro screen back. But you deserve a quick, 2 second 'good job.' Now get to work actually fixing the game Bethesda.
---
Naw.  Makes perfect sense.  If you remove 50% of the incentive for getting a subscription they would be more inclined not only to get a subscription but they would also buy extra atoms on a regular basis.  I'm sure all the people with subs would be just fine with getting less content for their dollars too.  Flawless.
---
I think they should just go back and add this functionality to all the existing shelves, desks and tables. Our CAMPS would look fantastic.
---
Fixed:p
---
You can. Here‚Äôs mine tested with a flowerpot and a vault boy standee:
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/dYlx1ch
---
All good. I just like it when everyone is kind to their fellow man. Too much toxicity already around here.
---
They have made it impossible to grind atoms for everything that they have released. You are right.
---
People buy it for exclusivity. Same as a 1000$ hoodie from supreme i guess.
---
Yeah I think the majority of people are on the same page.. but you know, there's always that cult of Bethesda bashers who will make anything into a problem if they can.
---
This is the most ridiculously presumptuous argument and then you end by saying they've 12" dicks, so confusing lol
---
We were given a decent product at a fair price. The subscription is a fair concept. The benefits attached to it are a great value for the price.
---
All of your complaints are rendered obsolete by the fact that people are actively paying for and enjoying the game and the new subscription. You and a small handful of other, whining, entitled little shits are upset. Big deal! No one cares.
---
then don't buy it if it's not worth it to you? lol plain and simple
---
That's my point. You either pay to not play the game or you play.  People with one of the components were missing but it's the gaming industry standard.  It blows but it's not going away anytime soon.
---
Well I figured at 2 inches of dick fucking others 6 times. Not too hot at math. :)
---
The tiddy up and stings and things quest have a chance to reward badges, usually I get 2-3 a week  , check your camp terminal for location if you don‚Äôt know where it‚Äôs at
---
Yeah i like the old atomic shop better. It just seems like the new one doesnt have much.
---
Maybe you can complete that broken challenge by doing it solo.
---
People still play this game?
---
There is no one left at BGS capable of an honest AMA. I cant even imagine legal giving a go ahead, let alone, senior management.
---
Sure, I'll bite. I've heard that although you see sneak bonus notifications (non-critical damage) on damage with the SBQ, they aren't actually causing those damage multipliers to the queen. Basically, for example, "2.5x" sneak damage is actually just 1x. Did you notice this or the opposite?
---
No, that literally makes no sense whatsoever. That would just sabotage the subscription, which a huge portion of the playerbase has bought into, and wouldn't do anything to encourage atom sales.
---
You may WANT that to happen, but that doesn't make any sense fiscally.
---
Because unfortunately people buy it
---
Sure, im a fool and will "cry and complain for any reason possible" cause i expect one of the biggest companies to show any level of willingness to fix the game instead of milking it with lazy cosmetics cauze they know there is still a small percentage of players that will buy it and its easier than putting effort into it. Im xone talking to you, you clearly have no clue what ur talking about
---
In general I could do away with the quirky lean this game has been directed in as of late.  I wouldnt mind a more serious tone is some future content with darker themes.
---
Even the Holloween event, while it was a lot of fun to blow up cars in the park, was light hearted.
---
A couple of tips....
---
1. Roofs take up more budget than floors.  Run stairs up to the roof and use floors.  Turn it into a patio deck.  Even with the security fencing you use up a lot less budget.
---
2. Foundations take up more budget than floors.  Use one foundation to go up a level and then another set of stairs to go down so that you can set floors at the ground level.  Replace your foundations with floors.  Usually, I keep at least the four corners as foundations so it looks like the floors are being held up by them rather than going with the floating effect.   One thing that is tricky about this is that if you need to make changes you need to tear up the whole floor and sometimes add a foundation and temporary stairs.  It can be a bit tricky and very frustrating.  But you save a bunch on budget.
---
3. Turrets and other security items take up a lot of build space.  That's why I never use them.  I scout every location where I build and make sure that it's not next to a Deathclaw spawn point.  I would rather repair than spend the budget on turrets.
---
4. Electrical conduits take up way too much budget.  I really like the look of them, especially against the brick walls, and really, really, really wish they cost the same as wiring, but they just eat up too much budget.  Replace them with the wiring electrical connectors and just run wires.  Saves a lot of budget for other things.  And electrical connectors can be attached to trees, rocks, etc.  They are my go-to for anything electrical.
---
5. Plants take up a lot of budget, go figure....   You would think that crops would be very light budget wise, but nope...  Only plant what you need.   I keep 3x to 4x of each plant with them scattered around the camp so that if one gets destroyed by wandering mobs I can repair it with the others.  Basically, I just use them for Grape Mentats, Disease Cure (Forrest), and Chally Feed.  I get enough meat from events to keep me fed and enough Purified water from taking workshops and plunking down water purifiers.  Water purifiers in workshops fill at about 10x the speed of the the ones at your CAMP.
---
So... those huge CAMPS with a lot of features...  they are using one or more of these tips to be able to build their CAMP within the budget.  The next time you happen across a large CAMP, take a look around and see how many of these tips they are following.
---
but I need those to see them, I'm colorblind and without it, I can't tell where they are in any of the grassy areas, doubly so if I am doing Queen's
---
Another good reason to nerf this bloodied BS.
---
This has been done thousand of times already, nothing special.
---
If you attempt to take the workshop, or you own the workshop and someone attempts to take it from you then you are open to PVP. Pacifist mode stops you from damaging others, it does not protect you.  Just walking into a workshop doesn't open you to PvP, but owning or claiming a workshop does.

I see that the website is not updated.  Here are the codes for this week.
---
    Alpha: 45721821  Bravo: 51798126  Charlie: 05491289
---
Only if they fix the snail pace scroll in the vendor window.
---
I put on excavator and load up on stuff to sell.  Load up to max carry weight  - 1700 #.
---
At that point, it takes a looonnnnmmmmmg time to scroll some of the lists to sell everything - certainly longer than 3 minutes.
---
If I hear/see someone come in, I'll usually say something so they know I'm actively engaging the bot, not afk or blocking.
---
I agree the flies do help locate them. It is quite the conundrum of a suggestion I realize.
---
This thread was about PA skins, not about bugs. So don't try and turn you original statement into something different. There is nothing wrong with paying developers to create more content. 
---
I hope you are truly "xone" talking to me, because you really are making no sense. Take your blind hatred somewhere else.
---
That is not what I imply. Even someone who has spent a lot, and has a disgusting amount of game time, cannot hope to own a third of what they have released. That is what it is. But the scale needs to be adjusted. Prices just need to go down. Keep current challenge rewards but reduce store prices.
---
A fortnite skin I can use 100% of the time costs between $8 to 15$. In 76, a game I paid $80USD for, I can pay 18 dollars for a skin that uses an item that will crash my game half the time.
---
have it around 20 to 30 . unless your going for a high ap build then go for what ever you like.
---
What bothers me is that people are buying it.  If people were not buying it, it would not be $18.
---
Stop buying it.  :-)
---
I leave plenty at the overseers camp completely free and fixed up to the max. I've used a lot of scrap helping low levels build their camp the way they like and I go around fixing up broken stuff at people's camps as well. I've dropped stuff at people's camps for them to sell as well. I have an entire vendor priced specifically for low levels. Everything else I sell is way less than the going rate as well. Ammo is one cap or free. My legendaries are 1000 caps per star unless they're god roll, in which case they're no more than 5,000 caps total. Even then, I'm willing to negotiate. I don't sell any of my stuff on eBay because that's a bunch of bullshit.
---
You want to talk about self centered idiots, you should probably get off your self righteous high horse first. Go ahead and downvote me. It's getting really old watching the latest Bethesda drama fill up with people on *both* sides talking like they know everything there is to know about the people they disagree with.
---
Thank you for the communication.
---
Is a fix for the game lock up / crash to desktop when nearby players attack an enemy with the Strangler Heart acid effect / Explosive Laser Gun with Gamma+Beta burn effect also in this list of issues that will be addressed?
---
Did you get to loot the nocturnal rolling pin from it?
---
I for one would like to be able to use my atomic shop gravemarker as the default pile, I can really see those above the grass and bushes.
---
Do you mind saying how much? I‚Äôm curious because I only go after the easily obtainable daily/weekly atoms and way to often forget about them altogether
---
not like i‚Äôm doing it with any malice. just intrigued to see. most of the names i list, i know through ps4 and feel they wouldn‚Äôt take offence to me listing them as a good player ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
This is what I do when I need wood. Fast travel to V76 run down the hill towards the bootleggers cabin. Then head to the mill. Loads of logs to gather on the way. Loot all the logs at the mill and kill all the ticks at the cabin and mill. Tick blood can be used for stimpacks. With woodchucker and butchers bounty you can get 300 wood and enough blood for 8 or 10 stims in 10 minutes.
---
I love that thing for when I die! Can see it from a mile away usually lol.
---
true true lol
---
Its a question of priorities - so much more could have gone wrong with some of the more complex updates.  Vending machines, display cases, and the stash box all tie in to item storage and your stash box.  That's not simple and that didn't stop them.
---
Yet storing what's on the favorites wheel they can't seem to get right - its just a few links to keep track of.  Ammo you had in the gun...  that should be an easy write/save operation.
---
Mainframe cores - well, they made armor take damage, they made something else invulnerable in the process...  see this is where priorities that are all wrong kills Bethesda.  People don't care or notice if their armor isn't breaking as often...  but no, they had to go messing with that part of the code instead of looking at stuff people are complaining about to them.
---
Like I said - their priorities are just all mixed up.

Can you help me figure out how many atoms I have spent according to the (owned) tag? I lost count and I only bought 3k total with money through the pint sized slasher bundle and the subscription, yet I've bought at least 3 different item packs: the Halloween, Mothman, Camo, and Bungalow http://imgur.com/a/cHWSLn1
---
I had someone purchase a weapon that wasn‚Äôt for sale in my vendor queue.  At first I thought I was hallucinating but yep that happened.  What the hell Bethesda!
---
Your frame rate would sky rocket when looking away from the meat piles results in the game engine telling the graphics processing unit to stop rendering those models and textures because they're no longer on screen. Its extremely inefficient, on any platform, to render something you're not looking at.
---
Since it happens on a private server as well, it really is possible there are just so many meat piles to render at once that the frame rate tanks. As much as I'd like to try to help further, I don't play FO76 on a console to try to test things out and relate my experience.
---
Just out of curiosity what xbox are you using ? I‚Äôm on xb1 s and the game runs fine all the time other than first entertaining whitesprings
---
hmmm... something something hours... carry the 1 ....

too damn long.

lol late night typo, lol
---
I had the same thing.  I just kept logging in anyway until it worked.  (For now at least)
---
Will for sure take note of this. Thank you!!
---
Downvoting me out of impotence doesn‚Äôt change the fact that your comment is disingenuous garbage. Most people don‚Äôt no life the game like you, so once again more evidence that your premise is null. Good day to you. Here are two completely unrelated sentences before I go:
---
I block morons and trolls
---
I won‚Äôt be seeing any more of your replies.
---
You downvoted me tho lol
---
Thanks!  
---
No GPU fix for me yet, lol, so still can't play...
---
Sorry that I don't like paying for features that used to be standard in the older Fallout games, like unlimited scrap, or that I think Bethesda would be better off putting the forward tent behind a quest and putting skins for it in the Atom Shop so that they can still make money off the tent, including making money from people who haven't even gotten the subscription. 
---
If they'd done that with the fridge and protectron, I and many others who've replied to earlier comments I made about questing those items and putting skins in the Atom Shop for them would gladly get skins for the stuff. 
---
&gt;I'm sure all the people with subs would be just fine with getting less content for their dollars too.
---
And yet people who don't like FO1st are the ones that get called greedy. Flawless.
---
I'm not using an xbox. I have a first gen ps4 pro.
---
Then budget your inventory better ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
After they implemented the damage cap nerf I stopped playing in survival mode.  I‚Äôm guessing so did a lot of other players. 
---
When it first came out and even later there were a number of players in that mode.  
---
No point in dumping resources into something that isn‚Äôt a skin or camp item or catered to the non PvP crowd.
---
lol where'd you come from then?
---
Maybe I can finally stop throwing out those 250DR pieces - I think I just scriped a V25250 Tesla just yesterday!
---
I now kind of wish it would bellow "STEALTH MOD ENGAGED! ENTERING QUIET MODE!" or something to that effect, if you have the Stealth Boy mod active.  
---
Just something fitting Liberty Prime's usual nonsense.
---
Bummer :/
---
No reason to downvote you. People have opinions, that is what America is about. However, think some people don‚Äôt understand that a stance has a better shot at being taken seriously if proper presentation is used. I read things on here to learn about the game, keep up with new developments. 
---
As far as my high horse, I don‚Äôt even understand where you are pulling that from, if I say that people who exploit other players players should examine theirselves before calling out Bethesda for price hikes... where is this proverbial high horse?
---
Then you‚Äôll get people complaining about how stupid Bethesda is for not taking advantage of holiday skins. I‚Äôve seen so many ‚ÄúBethesda take my money‚Äù posts.
---
I would happily pay $60 for that.
---
What about the Cloaking legendary effect? Is it just visual or is it an effect similar to Escape Artist?
---
Apologies for assuming, I‚Äôve heard PlayStation seams to struggle more from other posts in the past! Hopefully they do improvement to stability before wastelanders
---
I don't get the logic behind whoever sets the prices.
---
You could sell 10 things for $18, or sell far fewer things at $18 each while getting blasted on Reddit for being greedy.
---
What person in their right mind goes, "yeah second option sounds great!"
---
Most people who say they would buy it if it were cheaper really wouldn't though, they would just farm atoms for the things they want. Which some of us already do
---
It's all good. It was just an idea I've had rolling around in my head. My ps4 sounds like it's prepping for a space launch when I look at a lot of meat piles lol
---
So the selling point of FO1st is that it pay walls quality of life stuff? Because to hear many of its staunchest defenders, FO1st doesn't pay wall quality of life stuff. 
---
&gt;That would lose them money?
---
And myself and many others no longer buying Atom Shop bundles certainly hasn't cost them any money at all.
---
u/valkstrike? im on ps4
---
1800 is a lot to farm man I have only bought two skins since I started
---
That's what you're supposed to do if you don't drop cash, and most players wouldn't drop cash even if they were cheaper
---
It seems like it depends on the exact model/generation of ps4. My son has a newer ps4 slim or whatever the little on is called and the game runs better on it than mine.
---
Yeah I would love more of them, like that mod that made them look like a vault balloon bundle! That was amazing!
---
There's no stacking, it has it's own values.
---
Lol yes!
---
Yeah definetly. I just don't know what's wrong with it.
---
They've had stupid high prices for things since ESO's release, like $50 worth of crowns to access the bank from anywhere
---
Those are the codes from last week.  If you go to the website, it will say those were valid the week of 11/12 - 11/19.
---
Great point you make there.
---
I'm lvl +200 now. And chasing atoms is sadly all the content that is left for me.
---
Not everything in the atomshop fits my character. A lot doesn't in fact. So even these atoms become just a number to chase.
---
What kept me playing one might ask? Mostly /r/Market76 .
---
Something the community came up with themselfs and isn't an actual part of the game.
---
And to add to that. Why would I even want to buy the subscription? To get more of the atoms? A lot of stuff in the atomshop doesn't even fit the real post-war feel I want for my camp and character. And I understand that some people like to have holiday themed stuff but let's be honest it doesn't really give that fallout feel you are looking for in a fallout game. The atoms really ruin the immersion. Because a lot of times your character does stupid random stuff that doesn't make any sense at all within their own little story. I even came up with "It was a dream" if my character has to level up in a clown suit. To make it somewhat fit my own personal lore.
---
I wish we could've just buy ingame stuff with caps, then selling non cosmetic items would've been justified because you actually played and won your reward. The Whitesprings would be the ideal location for selling all that pristine pre war stuff, complimenting the lore of the bots that protected it all those years. But that wouldn't work with the grand moneymaking scheme these atoms truly are. As an older gamer I still don't understand those who buy the prices. You wouldn't do it on a carnival either. So how it ever came to be that people like to pay for virtual thus completely non existing stuff is beyond me. I still refuse to pay more than the initial purchase. And yeah I realise I will be called a freeloading problem by some. But I would rather donate to something like patreon than to have to deal with the weird ass game mechanics I see the latest years. Cause almost all games lately downsizes the actual game aspect to replace it with endlessly repeating grind mechanics with just that tad of addictiveness to it. So it doesn't matter how much you suck. Just try again or buy our cope out. 
---
Makes me want to cry out my eyes.
---
Also still a bit salty about the empty pumpkin rack plans that never dropped. Atleast that would've been a cool looking stairs to use on small height differences in the enviroment. But going off about the build mode and it's lack of actual building materials is a rant by itself.
---
Yeah it was one of the workers playing pranks on people. It was a holotape.
---
First access to beta servers might be nice, but quality of life stuff shouldn't be pay walled. Put the stuff behind a quest and put skins in the Atom Shop if you want money that badly. I was spending plenty in the Atom Shop before they decided to not treat their latest QoL stuff like they did with the backpack. And I can count on one hand how many times I've seen someone wearing a backpack that didn't have a skin on it so they definitely can't say they wouldn't make money off putting the improvements in through quests and putting skins for those improvements in the Atom Shop.
---
Yeah seems never see 3* in vendors anymore and they don't drop often.
---
Hah! Joke's on you. It was a zealots mini gun xD
---
What they need is to add some damn content to the game.
---
I comment on subs for games I don‚Äôt play. I don‚Äôt have to be a part of the game to think the economics surrounding it are scummy
---
This is exactly the reason it's so high, the people who spend don't care how expensive it is, and the people who don't spend don't care how cheap it is
---
Ya, it sounds like its ultra rare.  I see them sell on the trade sub for insane amounts.
---
Thanks for listing the buffs.  I was just discussing this topic with my regular crew last night.  
---
We joined in on a triple queen run with an organized group last night where the longest single time was just over two minutes.
---
Did you really feel the need to downvote me for that? Not that I give a fuck about fake internet points. But this obviously popped up on my feed, you shit head.
---
Oh is this an alt account of the person I responded too? Wow
---
Correct, to some extent, but I believe from my experience that Agility has the strongest influence overall, My Full Health Character has 26 Agility when Battling the SBQ in my regular Armor, and frequently (70%+), remains "Hidden" directly in front of the SBQ while firing an AAFFR 50 Cal into her head, I also get nearly the same results in PA using a Stealthboy Torso Mod.
---
The question isn‚Äôt about that.
---
It‚Äôs supply and demand.
---
Why do YOU even consider buying any skins in the first place?
---
If you consider buying any skins- then you are a part of the problem.
---
If you don‚Äôt consider buying skins then magically you are unaffected.
---
Weird.
---
Given that a private server costs them money when it's online, and you're essentially keeping it online without actively using it, that seems like behavior that costs them money to support someone who isn't actively playing the game...  and probably falls outside of their supported use cases.  I've considered doing the same thing, as I'd love to be able to have my resource collectors running all the time, but I think we'll have to wait until (hopefully) we have the ability to run private servers on our own hardware.  
---
Disappointing, but seems reasonable given their cost of running a cloud server.
---
Lmao sure that‚Äôs who I am. Do literally any research and try to find one single instance where me and this dude crossed paths lmao
---
How bad is earning atoms at level 200? I just hit level 50 last week and in that grind I earned about 700 atoms. Why does your atom earn drop by so much?
---
ten
---
I've got a few questions if you don't mind; What's your preferred weapon for your stealth melee build? I originally thought a stealth bladed combat knife for the extra 50% sneak damage it does, but it comes up short against a dcg in terms of actual power.
---
What type of armor do you use for stealth in general? Does the weight really made that big a difference? I have a low level sniper character I'm currently working on and I've been using light leather armor because I already have all the mods for it. Would switching to heavy leather or anything else in general hurt my sneaking ability? I'm currently playing as a glass cannon with virtually no damage resistance.
---
Yeah I agree with that
---
People don't usually sell them in machines as they are worth a pretty penny. It's usually trade for other high priced items.
---
Dude, I'm paying them $15 a month...
---
The best way to find wood that I've found so far is to equip the woodchuck perk card and run along the road that runs on the western edge of the map between Camden Park and Point Pleasant. Basically I run north at first with the water to my left and the road to my right until I get up around Point Pleasant, then turn around and run back along the opposite side of the road. This usually nets me a couple hundred wood in a few minutes. Log out and back in and repeat. Helps to bring a friend if you want to stockpile wood really quick! I hope this helps you out. :)
---
Ya man.  Even if all you do is the Pioneer dailies.  Those 2 challenges and the campfire tales event have a chance to give you a badge.  You don't have to grind any of the challenge badges at all if you don't want to.
---
I was lucky enough to have someone drop the high capacity plan when it was still bugged to be learned automatically on pickup without consuming the plan, otherwise I would probably care about them more
---
having different backpacks on you let‚Äôs u switch up defenses depending on situation, DR/ER/RR
---
Supply and demand.
---
Bethesda is obviously making money.
---
Just like the makers of FIFA/Fortnite are making mind boggling amounts of money.
---
It wont be long before most Games are free to hook Gamers in(Fortnite).The Micro-transaction side is worth Millions,apparently much more comes from this than selling the game to start with.
---
I personaly dont like where Gaming is heading.
---
I can see though why market forces is dictate where Bethesda priorities [lie.Like](https://lie.Like) i said they are selling $18 Dollar skins,it is because they are making shit loads of money.
---
How many hours of server per month do you think $15 supports?  These servers require high CPU core speeds, and cost quite a bit more than $15/mo to run 24/7 for a month.
---
If you‚Äôre PS4 I‚Äôg gladly toss you like 60 purified water just so you know
---
nope.. never had that happen to me on pc
---
You wouldn't want your alt accounts to cross paths, just upvote/downvote the same thing
---
You speaking from experience?
---
The hamsters that run in wheels to power the servers have unionized and are trying to make their grievances known
---
I used to have a novelty account for star trek references so yeah a little
---
Wait, I‚Äôm confused, why would you use a second account just for that?
---
Don't get me wrong, I want to be able to keep a private server running 24/7 as well!  I just am being realistic that they need to make money off of private servers and not lose money, and that keeping them alive when we're not actively using them greatly increases the risk of the private server costing more than the $15 they're asking for.
---
Agreed... A clear line of communication would be nice.
---
Agreed they add only to atomic shop which is dumb and making this game stagnate, give us something to farm for in game and something in atomic shop. They need a rule for every new atomic shop item they need to add a free item into the world.
---
I'm just laughing at people dumb enough to waste that much money on a gray scaled armor they already sold for 18 bucks. LOL that is more than the cost of this whole game.
---
I want to name people, too. There are some on Xbox that make me want to just leave the server.
---
Please, no more meat week. I'm burned out, Grahm's burned out, Chally's burned out. Clean Appalachia went well and **sort of** felt like new content, I'd rather do that.
---
Hell, FO4 Creation Club is priced better than this stuff. I quit buying Atom bundles long ago to vote with my wallet, but I bought a currency bundle (can't remember the exact name at the moment) for the Creation Club within the last week because not only are their prices more reasonable, but their freebies and sales are better as well.
---
Speaking of an eighteen dollar power armor skin in the Atom Shop, the thing I bought in the Creation Club recently was an eightish dollar bundle of three different camo skins for All the regular armors, ALL the power armors, and ALL (or at least most, if not all) of the weapons. Eight bucks.
---
The codes are current, the website is wrong.  Check they discord.

That's what a novelty is, it's just for doing fun stupid stuff like that. Used to be a lot of fake internet points to be made in novelties. Some of the good ones are still around and make money off of it, like that guy who used to draw shitty water colors of comments
---
You think I had the server up for 24/7 for a straight month? What? And how would this be different than just playing for a long period of time? If anything, it wouldn't use as much if I don't move locations much.
---
Chameleon, one has harder to detect. One shrouded wood, one piece is shadowed, the other 3 are modded for best dr/er. Second slot is 4x ultralite and chest is dense bos heavy. I tried different combos with 7 agility and the fixer, that works.
---
They sort of fixed the Ammo Bug.
---
Have noticed now when  i log on i have no weapon equipped atall.
---
Not sure if this is affecting everyone,or just me.
---
Have been noticing my light on when I didn‚Äôt turn it on too.
---
Yeah they would make much more money if cash gave you twice the atoms. 1800 atoms from in game currency is one thing but at least give us 200 atoms per dollar so the suit is only 9 bucks.
---
Their marketing team is awful for not looking at other games whose skins are only a dollar or two and those games make considerably more because of it
---
We may be able to help of you post a link to it. You can use that nukesdragons website.
---
Wait you can make money off of goofing around on reddit? I might need to find some new employment then
---
Hicap, Armored and Lead Lined Backpacks are nice.
---
I‚Äôve used it for maybe 5 hours so far and I haven‚Äôt heard any new lines at all.
---
I guess from the day on you got it. Since we got the 1650 immediately, atm of subscribing.
---
i loved the sheepsquatch story line. More cryptid quests plzzzz
---
Challenges stop rolling over at the do X 7600 times stage
---
It said in the patch notes that evidently it had new power armor lines.
---
That's great if you don't mind grinding, but if you just want to play the game, do your thing, and have fun, it's not the same. Even when I've actively tried to grind, there were always a bunch of challenges I just plain couldn't do.
---
I'm trying to express their likely perspective, but I understand you're upset and don't think it's reasonable for them to disallow keepalive scripts.  From someone who admitted to prior duping, it seems like you're far more focused on what you can get than considering how it affects the balance and costs to the maker of the game.  
---
I hope you can continue to enjoy the aspects of the game they allow for.
---
I want to use my Ultracite, but I can't till I find the plans for Calibrated Shocks (I'm a horder of junk on Xbox).
---
If anyone has them for sale, or would not mind making me 2 legs with the mods, I'll gladly pay! Please message me!
---
The damn freeze up on PC when using an aid item is really getting old. Froze in silo as I went to drink as I was dehydrated...already had put in key card. Sighz
---
I had killed like 50 SBQ when it randomly cleared.
---
I was using a Bloodied Meat Hook on its face at the time.
---
My theory on it clearing is that you have to be recorded as the last one giving SBQ damage before it dies.
---
I could be wrong.
---
It doesn't.
---
You still aren't making a whole lot of sense.  I did however appreciate that you understood I was being sarcastic at first then lost it.
---
If everything was free you just suggested they would have made zero dollars.  If you won't buy the actual scraptron that does something beneficial for you for 7 dollars or whatever it costs then you're not going to buy worthless skins even if they're 50 cents.  Many, many studies have been done on peoples buying habits and none of it supports anything you've said. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thank you, I thought this was only me since I started a new melee build. The stagger is insane, 6 or 7 staggers in 10 sec, I couldn't even move or attack, just doing some sort of drunk wibble wobble till I die.
---
/u/Aten_Ra - Thanks for doing this diligently as always. 
---
One note from me from last night:
---
On the Ranger Armor ‚Äúcloth physics‚Äù - it appears that the Revolutionary General Uniform and other outfits are affected too. 
---
It now appears like there is no cloth physics on most outfits like these two *(or whatever it does to give the appearance of loose fabric)* so most long coats now move with your legs in a kinda weird way.
---
&gt;More people would be willing to buy as well.
---
Exactly why people that say "cutting the price in half will make them lose money" makes me question how much money they actually want to see Bethesda making. I was spending a decent chunk of change back when the shop was priced better (and QoL wasn't pay walled). Then they jacked the prices (among other things) and my wallet slammed shut and has stayed shut, no matter how tempting that plague doctor mask was.
---
Things like this are often put out with big price tags as a marketing technique to make the other items in the shop seem more reasonable. $3-5 is a lot to be spending but it doesn't seem so bad when you can point to an expensive armor set and say but look what a good deal I'm getting on THIS one, it's only a quarter the price.
---
Ha congrats! I have one too and it shreds the scorcheds fastüëçüèª
---
Thanks as always!  
---
* low priority I bet..  
---
* Documented and resubmitted  
---
QoL  
---
* Moved to bugs and reported  
---
* Interesting, do you mean always on vs toggling it?  
---
* hmmmmmm new issue?
---
What platform
---
That's what's rumored in the PS4 NW crowd at least
---
Neither of those sections from ToS make sense to me for what you did. Is logitech macro a mod? If it's in nexusmods, and that's an approved third party program, I don't understand what was wrong.
---
No, the selling point is the value it has, based on what you get for the money. It's doing pretty well, if you pay attention to how many scrap boxes and forward bases there are in the works now. 
---
If they were really going that well off athe atom sales, don't you think maybe we would have avoided this marketing change? Atkeast until Wastelanders hit? Hardly anyone ever actually BOUGHT atims. Most people were just grinding out the free ones.
---
Again, you don't have to like it, but most of the player base dies so, get on board, or don't. Your specific wants and desires are irrelevant though, because they don't reflect the average player.
---
Holy shit
---
Probably have to pay for them.
---
Oh okay.  Still, I kinda wish the effect applied at least
---
I scripted it... XD already have a better one.
---
Do I really need to? Or have you played the game for more than 1 hour? Or even read the titles of the last 100 posts after the patch?
---
I just want to go back to being a slaver, cannibal psycho
---
lol hope you got 40 scrips out of it!
---
V few people make it to that stage though and start complaining long before they need to, they just don't want to farm atoms lol
---
YEA. Its a fucking quality of life fix behind a paywall. This game doesnt have 1/1000th of the content ESO does, and it shouldn't be monetised the same way.
---
Will do later. Thanks.
---
Yeah. I run a full set of wood chameleon sneak armor x3 powered x 2 agility &amp; ifs amazing
---
because they just want money, it's only gonna get worse and worse because they don't care smh...
---
Garunteed you have encountered some bullshit that should have been fixed long ago before they decided camp objects were more important than bugs?
---
You are one special creature. 
---
Do you think these "private servers" (saying that alone makes you special) cost anywhere near 13? You can host *actual* private servers for less than that, with more slots, on more complex games, from smaller companies. 
---
This is just Bethesda being their typical pos selves. But go on, champion for them more ye white knight.
---
Yeppers, doesn't hit the performance of the world and we are totally happy building our hearts out.
---
Increased Camp budget would be nice but so would being able to build closer together. I mean come on me and my friends would love to be able to build closer to each other, our own little Settlement so to say.
---
so basically ESO houses?
---
lvl ten weapon?
---
Crazytown. I feel like I have them thrown at me all the time
---
Lol sorry bud I was agreeing with you but being sarcastic.  Guess i forgot my /s
---
My bad lol
---
..the number of the community guideline this post violates...
---
The thing is though that not buying it isn't voting with your wallet. Not buying it is like not voting at all. They're not losing anything if you don't buy it, but gaining much more if someone else does. So yeah of course they milk it because someone *is* voting for it by buying it. It's not like there's a way to make them lose money
---
Yeah I thought the atom complaints were a little excessive but if that's to way they do atom quests i finally understand why the atom store is boycotted so damn much. Man fuck Bethesda
---
It's not a mod. Just the old Logitech Gaming Software. The problem is that they don't actually cite any specifics as a reason for the suspension. And then they make it sound like this is the "Final Warning." Which completely sucks as someone who was permanently banned for duping way back when. I know the pain of losing hundreds of hours already.
---
From what I recall Morgantown provided some really good results for him.
---
You are correct.
---
Our current wall mounted cabinet is broken. It doesn't snap to walls properly.
---
It happening a lot does not make it legal. There and s a lot of drug trafficking, murdering and forgering too. I don't care if they abandon a game which can exist on its own (Fallout 4) but 76 is an online game which needs fixing and technical support.
---
Oh yeah, still totally should. Just add it to the long list of "should be"s though. üòñ
---
Most atom challenges go 76/760/7600 so the early ones *are* easy but it starts to dry up aside from dailies and weeklies
---
not yet but they would do it (just my opinion)
---
You're on the shitlist! I wonder if autohotkey gets you banned? That would be the easiest to script for. I don't use anything cause I'd rather not have this happen. Sometimes tempted by the card swap on nexus. Remember when henny used to post, he said he used a rubber band on his controller. Pc should be easy enough to hold down the arrow button. Not sure what they consider bannable though.
---
Bethesda Game Studios is working on Starfield and ES6. You want an AMA with the Austin team, AKA Battlecry Studios, who are currently hard at work on Wastelanders which, if implemented properly, should really end up being Fallout 76 2.0, and their only shot at redeeming themselves from the vitriol. 
---
Regardless, the communication has always sucked with Bethesda, they play their cards very close to the chest. "It just works" is the summation of what they'd likely tell you anyway.
---
Or dying in scorched earth while fighting the queen outside the nuke zone and respawning in the nuke zone.
---
Truly not being a dick but can you provide source? Theres a lock picking mod I want to use but am scared too since it tells you exactly where to place the pick before turning. It's on nexus mods though sooo....good to go?
---
IF YOU DONT WANT IT THE DONT BUY IT SIMPLE AS THAT
---
I mean it kinda feels like that already :) But yeah, that would be even more awesome.
---
You get logged out if you just hold one key. At least in my experience. I have never used AutoHotkey.
---
Agreed
---
Are all your pieces 3* with htd or just one piece?
---
Dude, it says final warning. That means you knew that this would happen.
---
"The account is receiving a 72 hour suspension and **a final warning**..."
---
No more than I usually do in any other stash.
---
I would be cool with giant versions of creatures for designated areas. Like a giant mothman if you nuke Point Pleasant.
---
The sarcasm was definitely lost on me üòÇ
---
I saw someone with TWO camps yesterday. 
---
And they were not a survival tent and their own camp, it was legit TWO MARKERS (with vendors)..
---
IDK how, but it happened
---
When we pay for them next
---
Yup - I believe that's it
---
I never used that one specifically because I considered it cheating and I wasn't sure about them. I only used UI mods.
---
As I understand it, Fallout 1st went live on October 23rd.  So the earliest you can expect Atoms would be three days from now.
---
There were no prior warnings. I can post a screenshot of my service/help support history.
---
i would love to have some of these hidden doors in f4, i spent most of the time building secret bullshit bases there lmao, also i wish we could modify terrain so we can build basements, if not just place a prebuilded structure that can go underground.
---
This fix is slated for our Wastelanders update, however, we know that it is a highly requested fix. So we are trying to pull it out of that update and into a December update. First, we need to make sure that nothing will break in doing this. We'll let you know as soon as we have more information and timing on this!
---
Its such an awful business tactic they honestly expect us to believe this skin is more valuable then Automatron for Fallout 4 &amp; more then half of Far Harbor... riigghhtt it would bring them much more revenue if they were priced reasonably sure maybe you can get a few hundred 18 dollar sales but you could get a few hundred thousand or a million 5 dollar sales which tbh 5 is too much but it will never be priced accurately so I think thats the middle ground just saying then they wouldn‚Äôt feel impossible to earn either that way instead for 5 dollars we get content that can be found in the strategy guide &amp; was deliberately cut to be sold back to us later in the form of a scrap bot &amp; thats why this game will forever under preform greed comes first think about all the awesome stuff in the atomic shop that in previous games would have been a cool or unique item at the end of a quest or dungeon Beth is literally selling us skins from Fallout 4 &amp; now even the good ones thb -_-
---
That's not necessarily true; NW is full of skins and camp items that can only be earned by participating in PvP. A battle royal mode just made more sense. Survival was just a matter of which person with the stealth boy and Tesla rifle hit you first. There's not a whole lot of fun to be had when everyone has the same duped gear.
---
Just one. I'm not sure it even stacks. I know Jon made a video and has several pieces on, so can't say for sure. Some datamine says it can't stack.
---
Nope. I have gotten many killing shots on the SBQ and it never worked. I know for a fact because I sometimes melted it into an ash/goo pile while facetanking with my vampire's plasma thrower or killing the adds with a tesla rifle. I felt bad and some people were pissed because they couldn't loot it after that. And yet it never counted as me killing her. I've also had situations where I individually dealt 1/3 or 1/4 of the total damage, so that isn't a realistic expectation either
---
It seems to happen when I login with a weapon that *should* be fully loaded.
---
If my magazine is not full, then it displays the correct ammo count.
---
Huh, then I must have been hallucinating when this scenario happened to me over the weekend. Pacifist was on
---
&gt;If everything was free you just suggested they would have made zero dollars. 
---
Didn't say everything should be free. Private servers shouldn't be free. Nor should the bonus atoms included in that subscription. Nor the extra Atom Shop discount. Quality of life stuff should be free, with skins for it in the Atom Shop if they need money that bad. Heck, walls are a QoL thing and wallpapers for them are a hit.
---
&gt;Many, many studies have been done on peoples buying habits and none of it supports anything you've said. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Then I guess everyone else that agreed with me that they'd gladly buy skins for the fridge and the protectron if the base items were behind quests were full of shit. Heck, I remember how many people went and got the small free backpack and then were making posts about how the skin they just got in the Atom Shop for their *free* backpack isn't showing up on the backpack.
---
I don‚Äôt blue screen but I am having no luck getting him to spawn any where
---
Htd stacks, the datamine was trying to say that chameleon doesn‚Äôt stack at all for npcs which I don‚Äôt think is accurate
---
I never even got mine, submitted a ticket and they told me I had when I know for a fact I didnt
---
This fix is slated to be apart of the Wastelanders update, but we know this is a highly requested fix. We're trying to pull it and put it into an update in December but need to make sure nothing breaks from doing that. We'll let you know when we have more information on that.
---
Wth is it???? It just lately and no one is reporting on it. Lol
---
You're basically saying "It's great you're spending more time on Wastelanders but spend less of that time on wastelanders so I can keep playing this game". Pick a lane, dude.
---
Also, holiday event is coming.
---
Ah, see why you were using a macro then. Written a lot of stuff in autohotkey, it's pretty good. They probably look for the exe though, might rename it.
---
Todd Howard works hard for your money. I pay Todd $18 everyday for merely existing and letting us bask in his splendor. It's an honor for you to be able to buy that kind of satisfaction and I am reporting you to the Bethesda re-education camps for even thinking to question his holiness.
---
Karma for duping
---
Dang
---
Should've done that from launch.
---
Try the other bridge up north before hitting the one south, I usually blue screen when I run south first
---
People supported ESO and it didn't affect FO4's MTX
---
Technically, their TOS prevents you from using any hardware not approved by Zenimax. And since they do not have an approved list anywhere, you could be banned, not just from using a Logitech macro, but a Logitech mouse as well, as it is technically unapproved 3rd party hardware. All hardware and drivers are unapproved third party software and hardware that will influence your game play, and are therefore not allowed.
---
Section 9 of their TOS includes:
---
&gt;You agree not to use any hardware or software or any other method of support that is not authorized by ZeniMax or that may in any way influence or advantage Your playing abilities, or influence or advantage Your access to or receipt, play or use of the Services.
---
I know you are thinking, "Wait, it is impossible to not violate the TOS? That cannot be legal." And you are correct, it is not. It is known as Impossibility of Performance and it makes a contract unenforceable in the USA. In other countries, there are other consumer protection laws that are far more strict that this also violates. All it would take is one pissed off person to take it to court, and refunds would be ordered for everyone that had enforcement action taken on their account while the TOS included this language. 
---
TLDR; Their TOS is not enforceable and any enforcement they do while it is in place, is illegal.
---
There is no Exe in the game files. Logitech Gaming Software is a universal, official program. Although you can make it detect when a specific game is being used.
---
I put it at that price just to show it off. It doesn't appear in a display case, unfortunately.
---
I can't be bothered to patch the game, and I can't find anything about this on Google; is it just a skin or is it a new full set? Either is outrageous I'm just curious.
---
I've sold my extra badges for a nice chunk of change, first high capacity mod I sold for 30k, my last one sold for 1,500 serums. I have them all unlocked for me, now any I get are just potential profit.
---
yeah I wouldnt spend it either, but I could care less if others do :)
---
Hmm... I don't know then. It's very odd language to use assuming you've never been given a warning before.
---
Why were you keeping the server up with the macro?
---
Try hitting up a CM and seeing if they can work out something through a back channel.
---
It's literally a low res grey power armour that screams democracy every three minutes
---
Me &amp; my teammates talk about this all the time. building our own little settlements &amp; towns or forts. We've even tested to see how close we could get them.
---
Communists trigger it
---
Waiting until the gun starts shooting and then aiming in or vice versa gets around the issue. If you aim while the barrel is still spinning up, the glitch always happens
---
Maybe it was 2 teammates with very similar names?? Or a glitch? Not doubting you though, I've seen crazier stuff in this game. lol
---
I don't care what others do, aside from bethesda. I don't like them constantly making this game worse and worse. But people want to waste more money on a skin than the cost of the entire game, that is their problem not mine. I sure as hell will mock them for being that dumb though.
---
Like buying ocean front property in Arizona.
---
Sorry, I'm actually not sure cause I've never used mods before. I should have made my phrasing a little more clear, but I meant the part about nexus more of saying if it is allowed and that's what OP is using, then I'm not sure what they did wrong. I hope someone with more knowledge than me can help you though:)
---
I avoid Charleston train station as I always crash there. Never go to the station vendor either. The places I‚Äôve found it most are the one near White Powder Winter Sports and the one down in Flatwoods.  Mama Dolces a good one but I‚Äôve never found it at the ice cream place and I‚Äôve server hopped a lot for it.
---
You are comparing apples to oranges here. Selling drugs is a well documented crime that is enforced. There is no legal punishment for abandoning software that isn't profitable. Unless when sold you were given a guarantee that it would be supported for a certain time period. 
---
At most, they could be sued to reimburse those who bought the game, but it would have to be proven that you didn't get your money's worth out of the game. I'm sure that would disqualify anyone who has spent more than a given number of hours playing the game.
---
Noooo. Don't even have any experience in PR and know that this would be an absolute disaster.
---
They should communicate with us more directly. None of this arms-length Inside the Vault bs but not opening asking for people to massacre them.
---
Not sure where you got that from, the Atomic Shop notes say they‚Äôre the same lines.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/01kmDuEu7AM5whFYG65K3p/atomic-shop-update-15-items-and-sales-november-19
---
I always just ran through hitting E on them because I don't use explosives. But there's a quicker way to pass that part
---
The microtransactions data is a bit hard to follow. So one thing that is clear in the purchase data from other games is that players by-and-large value one specific item per category.
---
Mostly outlier players (richy rich or careless mcMoneyless) will buy many varieties of say 10MM pistol paints. Most players will only ever buy 1 paint for power armor, one paint for 10mm, one costume. So they price certain categories knowing that it will only be purchased once per player... Anyways $18 is still too fucking much for a piece of digital art
---
They'll probably have another Thanksgiving bundle next week.  That's how they did it with Halloween.  Try to trick you like that, by double-dipping.
---
there are a couple loops that result in a a "net gain" of scrap vs a loss, requires super duper so really gain, so it's up for debate how much of a bug it is
---
Nuke minesüòç
---
Yea white powder is my second best charleston only once or twice tho and momma dolces i get the mothman more then anything then he flies away before i can hit him lol
---
Lol, look at my post from two hours ago. It triggers *a lot*.
---
I'm on PS4, so no mods for me, but it doesn't take to long to plug everything into Excel. I have the weights for everything, so I just have to mark how many of each item I have.
---
Can confirm. Atoms was a main driver for me to sub to 1st. Was already dropping $10.00 everytime the E3, Quake, etc. Atom bundles dropped.
---
We asked for something. They delivered.
---
It's a very easy thing to deliver but that's beside the point. They resolved an issue a lot of people wanted.
---
It's so self explanatory, it surprises me that it even needs to be said but here we are.
---
Exactly. Reddit still doesn't fully grasp the fact that it is *not the majority*. In the grand scheme of things, Reddit is a pretty niche community. Bigger than most? Sure, but not bigger than the huge number of people who just buy the game, play it, and don't engage with any form of online discussion. Be it Reddit, YouTube, or anything else. 
---
These are the people buying from the Atom shop, and Bethesda's figured it out it's a lot easier to just profit off of them than it is to remain in the good graces of their most passionate fans.
---
I'm not sure cant you also make alternate accounts and get easy atoms of a lower lvl again?
---
Really wonder if there is not something engine side we are not seeing on our side, I died to (2) standard, non-glowing ghouls during the Halloween event, killed in a softlock and taken from 100% health while in PA to dead.  
---
aka specific things seem to be completely bypassing all resistances
---
purveyor sale doesnt count. its just a discount to existing content. i get it. but something else would be better imo :-P
---
Wes Tek and Whitespring usually have at least 2-3 legendaries per run and enough higher level enemies that you should level up fairly quickly.
---
Also, don your PA or hazmat and head to a nuke zone for legendaries and high level crafting components.
---
There's always the various C.A.M.P. plans and Scout outfits you can obtain from the dispensers as well.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/373399/silo-mainframe-explosive-weapons-don-t-work/29
---
"Hi, after discussing this thread with the devs today,¬†mainframe cores not being damaged by explosive weapons¬†is definitely a bug and not any sort of intentional change. We're looking into a fix!"
---
Not an exploit, it's clever use of your surroundings and inventory
---
I had a lot of workshops up and I was the only one on the server at the time.
---
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out if its a backdoor Berry Mentats.
---
@Valseek has already said over at the Bethesda site that this was not intentional and is a bug they are looking in to...
---
That already happened with the indefinite suspension on said account.
---
I can't find it now but, some peeps on one of my discords posted some patch notes where it claimed to have new lines.
---
Nuka Grenade is the solution.
---
This is brilliant news! It needs to be fixed so we can go back to what we love!
---
I wish they would add more lines period.
---
Yeah, someone just messaged me, at least it‚Äôll be back to the good old days soon...
---
Honestly it kinda reminds me of ESO, its payment plans and it's in game items are very similar in cost. You even get the whole infinite crafting storage in ESO with a sub. I'm okay with that. The thing i am not okay with is how much content is in ESO, and how much more polished it has compared to this game. If you stack them side by side I would say ESO is worse cuz of those weird card loot box things. They even give out crowns monthly like atom points. But ESO is a successful game...why? Because there's alot of shit to do. A huge story..massive areas, working raids, player housing THAT IMO blows fallouts out of the water. I mean you can live in a giant castle comeon. The issue I honestly have with fallout is not the atomic store. It's the state of the game. I have seen games with these money monitary schemes do just fine. They just need to get up off their buts. Communicate and be honest with the community. Stop with short term feel good pills, and fix things that have been going on since 1912. ESO is now hugely successful, they have tons of these crowns/atomic things to buy. They just had...you know.. a lot more to do in game, without payment to make it kinda balanced. 
---
To summarize. 
---
Just fix the game please. Add more content. We will talk about atom points when you fix the huge list of reddit bugs.
---
That flower hat, or fruit hat maybe, with it would look cool. I don't have chick chars but I like me some outfits
---
The only way I could justify paying $18 for paint for some armor is if it were worth the $18..
---
Like custom animations, special interactions, custom emotes, unique armor design- You know like liberty prime.
---
But no, we get blue, black, lighter black, gray, red, and another shade of gray.
---
Don't forget - took them 11 months to fix prime combat rifles using ultracite .44 ammo. &lt;5 minute fix in an item editor that was essentially just a typo
---
Took them many months to start fixing typos in daily/quest instructions, plans, etc
---
I haven't played in a while, but last I checked they still didn't fix the second space after the vampire's prefix. Literally just need to delete one character
---
I believe some grenades (nuka quantum?) still have an explosive radius of 50 instead of 500. Again, a typo that is unfixed since launch despite being reported hundreds of times
---
Ultracite laser weapon mods are still broken despite being specifically made with the intent of being these cool end-game weapons designed specifically for the scorched threat. If I understood the dataminers correctly, they are literally just linked to use some regular laser weapon mods instead of ultracite laser weapon mods and this causes conflicts with stats, animations, etc.
---
Many legendary effects are still broken, such as the now infamous +250dr negating prefixes. Stalker's still drops on melee weapons despite not affecting them, explosive is still horrendously broken on any weapon with splitters even though they said they would change them many many months ago. The dragon still gains a damage bonus per pellet instead of +20% total like other weapons
---
It took until the beginning of 2019 to fix the plasma rifle dropping with only 1 legendary attach point, and until the end of the summer for wood armor. 
---
It took until the previous patch to fix the hazmat effect having a copy-pasted description of rad resistance when it really gives disease resistance
---
Took them like 3-4 months to start addressing duplication exploits that were publicized during the beta. Took until the end of this year's summer to finally fix them, and they introduced a few new ones throughout the process as well. Don't forget that right after fixing the worst one, they immediately rolled back the fix with the next update so people could dupe freely again for a few days until it was finally hotfixed.
---
SBQ still likes to fly off into space/the savage divide/ten miles outside the map whenever she gets bored of standing still tanking hundreds of bullets
---
Game-breaking damage bug that was around since launch, was slightly fixed in January, and then came back to launch levels with vault raids is still a problem for many end-game weapons
---
I could keep going, but aten_ra's bug roundups do all of this a lot more justice than I can
---
So you thought
---
Are you calling Liberty Prime a snowflake? Because I sure am.
---
It has been formally acknowledged as a bug.
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/post/2456767](https://bethesda.net/community/post/2456767)
---
Lol
---
Thank you. So many complaints about Atoms = $$$ and everything being behind a paywall. We just had Meat Week and Halloween events, which were free items. And if someone wants to support them game and buy Atoms, let them. No one is forcing you to. Paints, extra scrap and 15 individual food items lasting 50% longer isn‚Äôt game breaking, folks. When they start selling actual high tier armor and weapons, then bitch about it.
---
Now that's downright dandy.
---
Actually, yeah, they probably were just agreeing with you to try to get free stuff or think that's them but in reality it is not.  Again, many many studies have been done on peoples buying habits.  If they aren't an impulse buyer they aren't an impulse buyer and impulse buyers are the people that fund microtransactions.  Aka if you aren't already a 1st subscriber or person who purchases atoms statistically you will never be.
---
Thanks for the comment!  
---
*\*nod\**  
---
That is a known bug that is happening to all players, and an old one.  
---
Odd thing is it doesn't happen to everyone, then will stick for a while and randomly stop happening.  
---
Have it logged here, and don't let this stop you from commenting in the future, I'd rather hear the same bug 100 times vs missing a critical one!.

Thanks for the reply.

Crazy snipe was recorded cheating with aimbot and just posted about lol

Have it listed below, and Bethesda has commented and said a fix is "coming in the future"

no, clearly the world is filled with communists. they must all be eradicated.
---
wow, cool, must be a easter egg, great find :)
---
Thanks, let me know if you get a chance to test (and if you can capture a picture that would be awesome!)  
---
I don't have either outfit needed.
---
Basically anything that engages as hostile triggers it.  
---
Will it show up as a red dot on your radar? Well that's red, and LP hates the Reds!
---
I have never heard of anyone being banned for using something from Nexusmods. I specifically enjoy the TextChat mod myself.
---
Alchemical killed me after this thread popped up this morning and waved. Same spot his buddy KC tried farming me a few times at
---
Full Charge does damage when sprinting into an opponent and is worthless unless you mean Power User which is under Intelligence (I think)....Sturdy Frame is useless as PA takes a beating and is easy to repair...I have 2 characters, at levels 386 and 165 and maybe repaired PA 2 times with no perk cards except to get them to 200% when building and repairing
---
+2 CHA, +3 INT and +50% Hunger
---
Wait, so you're not a Fallout 1st sub then?
---
He just posted a vid showing Crazysnipe using aimbot I think, gonna grab a link
---
Thanks for this.  I find this interesting.
---
Cool
---
you mean the pass that cost 8 bucks  each month/event? that give you the tokens that were yours already? to change for orbs for a chance that maybe between 150 champs you would get a good skin for your main or something? how is that better or how is beth much worse than that lol
---
Downvoting rabbids keep saying, "it's not a game you win" and I say that the only way to win is to not give them any more money.
---
This seems to be common in Public events lately, with Scorched Earth being the worst, even rad roaches &amp; Ticks do major damage to me in PA, when I could previously stand toe to toe with the SS Imposter, Yao Guai, or DC for several seconds, now I have to run/jump away from simple insects, or die quickly.
---
üòÇ
---
Nvm it was someone named sealman
---
shhhh, be vewy, vewy qwiet.  I'm hunting....
---
Is this the same Crazysnipe? 
---
https://youtu.be/p-wwAlzwynQ

honestly i dont buy PA skins... they are always expensive... with that amount i can buy a bundle or a lot of shits for the camp
---
and this one is fking ugly lmao
---
also i always wait for sales
---
I like 4 Unyielding and 1 chameleon. 2nd star I like poison resist and AP Regen, for 3rd star Sentinel doesn't work when sneaking, but I have 1 piece with it, a couple Cavs for retreating and 'harder to detect whilst sneaking'
---
Ps4 now? Alright, welcome to the party.
---
This!
---
For real? Like really for real? Why was there talks of a class action over the bags and state of the game at launch but no talks about this potentially very real thing?
---
Scorched Yao Guai....  
---
Wonder if they don't have an AoE or some other attack that is completely bypassing armor...  
---
Thanks for this, will try and find time to dig around in the ESM
---
Step 1 : Build real power armor
---
Step 2 : Spend 18 bucks for spray paint
---
Step 3 : Actually be able to paint a real power armor
---
They are economic morons who run things at Zenimax, and as a matter of fact, their CEO was so bad at it, that he's had some actual legal problems in terms of economics and banking.
---
Overcharging in order to save production costs only works when you actually have physical products to manufacture. The way it works is that if you charge 'slightly too much' fewer people will buy it, but you still make the same amount of profit because you have to make FEWER products in order to bring in the same dollars.
---
Bethesda sells digital products that require ZERO manufacturing, so the fact that they are employing this kind of model shows that the people in charge are a) idiots and b) have no idea how the digital marketplace even works.
---
in a word, "boomers"
---
I'm going to put my Wastelanders companion in a slave collar for that very reason.
---
Thank you. Yeah harder to detect while sneaking seems to be a good attribute with bloodied.
---
Vampire, with hopefully a fast-firing weapon. I prefer a gatling laser, as it hits so quickly that I'm nearly always at full health.
---
I bought the greenhouse and it is cool but hard to find a place to put it and stay under budget
---
If they did, the only people allowed to ask questions will be Fallout 1st members.
---
What bothers me.....is why people will pay  $2 for a soda...$12 for a hamburger..$30 for fake smoking habit....no complaint........but BGS is treated like the devil for an item that costs digital currency you are already earning for free...is not a requirement for the game at all...so your not even forced to buy it...
---
The Walking Dead - West Virginia: Where all of the "no way they survived that" events of the show actually ended in death.
---
Much shorter run than the current syndication, but some might say that's a good thing...
---
&gt;yeah the prices need to be dropped. I've saved up over 3.5k atoms from casual play since the BETA
---
Silly you, thinking you could use facts and logic on a Bethesda hate thread in this sub. Ah well, I gave you an upvote to at least stop the bleeding on your karma!
---
I don't have an issue surviving most things with serendipity, dodgy, and blocker, they all mitigate a lot of damage taken. But there is the occasional bear that one hits me lol
---
Yup, sometimes between 2020 and interstellar tourism.
---
Realllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly?  
---
Hmmmmm I'll have to see if I can find a few outfits with cloth physics and test them later, appreciate the comment, will also check the Nifs.  
---
**Edit:**  
---
Nif's have the correct "Cloth Bones" so now I'm really curious
---
That's very nice answer, thx for letting us know, really appreciate. I know it need to be tested thoroughly, but I have so many really nice weapons that are partly broken (not to mention their value loss) that I really hope for fastest fix possible. But yes, please make sure to brake something else in the proces ;)
---
I've had previous luck a bit east of Wilson brothers auto repair, at the cross roads of the road and train tracks, but I havent had a single resonder vendor drop in 2 weeks at any of the locations.
---
Charleston Capital Building usually has a legendary or two and heaps of XP to be earned.
---
Events like Uranium Fever, Free range and Awol Armaments have at least one legendary
---
fissures seems to spawn legendary scorchbeast pretty regularly now.  Good xp from them plus the adds they summon.
---
I like the idea but that area is used for one of the main quest area's in the game.  I would rather see it in the lobby at Whitesprings.  There is already tons of crafting benches and stores.  All they would really need is a legendary grinder and make the fast travel point be inside the building.  It would be a great area to team up as well.
---
If there were handcuffs then ya for sure. But I dont know. Outfit doesn't match. Head doesn't match. It's a dead guy against a pipe missing am arm.
---
I'm all about more budget ASAP. Don't expect it in the super near future, but it would be a nice Christmas gift at least. :P 
---
If they're waiting for Wastelanders it's gonna be a pain.
---
I didn't see any cheating. Looks like they play in 3rd person, and have pretty good aim. 
---
You'd be suprised at the range when ADS'ing in 3rd person, and if they run longshot in their build, you can accurately "snipe" with handmades and ACR's at sniper distance.
---
Well if you display anything (you can‚Äôt display power armor)  it is stored in your stash. So either way it‚Äôs gong to take up the appropriate stash space along with build budget I believe.
---
&gt;This is obviously turning into a cash grab.
---
Certain paints and such have always been high priced, it's not something new. Blackbird paint was 1800 when originally released in late winter or early spring
---
Another way to do legendary farming now is going around to all the fission sites and killing the scorchbeast legendaries.
---
I would appreciate if you could attempt having a discussion, rather than throw your opinions based on nothing but your subjective opinion and feelings:
---
 "We were given a decent product at a fair price. "
---
Initial reviews and community response was mixed at best. I am glad you enjoyed it but this is only your subjective opinion. By the way did you know that $60 for a video game can be considered a fair price for less than 10% of the world's population? Just something to consider.
---
" The subscription is a fair concept " Yes subscription is a fine concept in general for certain games. A subscription in a full price game that alleviates the limitations that were imposed by the developer in the first place? Again, subjective.
---
 "All of your complaints are rendered obsolete by the fact that people are actively paying for and enjoying the game and the new subscription. "
---
Please explain how do you render a complaint obsolete because someone else feels different about the subject? How is that an argument?
---
" You and a small handful of other, whining, entitled little shits are upset. Big deal! No one cares. "
---
Please pull the numbers so we can decide if it is small or not, but I agree the group can be a vocal one. 
---
Now calling me a little shit that is whining and upset. I think you are projecting because...
---
I enjoy Fallout 76.
---
I believe this is a solid product that deserves BETTER MANAGEMENT. It was sold incorrectly, it was supported incorrectly. I think this is a nice game that was presented as something that it was not.
---
I ask you again and I hope you try to use at least ONE argument, instead of your subjective opinion:
---
Why are you defending a multi-billion dollar corporation? If anything, people who complain about the monetization and predatory practices fight for a better product for EVERYONE, you take it as a personal insult for some insane reason I fail to grasp. In all of this, more or less valid critique is drawn by unpaid cheerleaders who will always disagree with everyone else because they dont see or understand the issue, or the subject matter. Exactly as you have demonstrated.
---
I believe the term to call such behaviour would be and "Useful Idiot". I think you can be more than that.
---
No thanks. I don't feel like watching corporate spin and gamer vitriol competing for an hour. The worst of both elements would pretty much define a 76 AMA.
---
Same here...
---
Fair point. It has always been a cash grab
---
They could also tweak the cost of various items to be more reasonable so we can get more bang for our budget.
---
The Virginia, Slocum Joe and Nuka Cola neon billboards still take up like a third of the budget. Increasing our budget or not, that's absolutely ridiculous.
---
Because apologist said "but you can earn that currency in game!" When people complained at launch.
---
I'm kind of ready for the game to get back to it's roots.
---
I want to explore the vaults and uncover the tragic/dark stories that led to their inhabitant's demise. 
---
I want to go on BoS/Enclave questlines given by actual human NPCs instead of terminals and holotapes. 
---
Stuff like that. I feel like this game already has a good bit of horror in it with the Wendigo/The Mire region stuff.
---
Right? I can take massive hits from SB but a ghoul can one shot me. lol Hence the debate of Deep Pocketed vs Radiation mods. I do have all the right perks. I guess I'm looking to fine-tune the build on a micro level. :)
---
I just go in camera mode and have an old shell casing hold my move button-down, no macro needed!
---
I get that, but single player offers a lot of flexibility that multiplayer games don't have.
---
Can you earn creation club points like Atom Shop points?
---
&gt;Life is too crazy and dark to punch down so I just let the downvoters have their joy as it literally does not affect the person being downvoted in the slightest
---
Amen brother,  amen!
---
I got the game for 15 a while ago and i havent played it in a while. Dont think i ever will
---
Whale hunting. Thats what the free market provides.
---
This talking power armor is annoying as hell and if less people buy it that's ok with me.
---
watched most of this and just see a good player. this isn‚Äôt a post for conspiracies and speculation. i personally think crazy_snipe is a very good player. and i also feel like some of the people out there are quick to say people ‚Äúhack‚Äù without potentially even knowing the player and there just butt hurt they got killed. most of these accusations are just chinese whispers at this point.
---
It looks like some hillbilly stole a bike and bought ten cans of flat black from the Dollar Store to try and hide the fact.
---
That's amazing! I purchased it but can't seem to find it. Is it under tables?
---
Definitely same name. Must have been a glitch but it was impressive that the server held that up.
---
yup
---
Yes, on the same tab as the West Virginia tables.
---
Interesting. I might try that although I am worried at doing anything at the moment since I'm on my "Final Warning" and all.
---
man, basics love that Hunter's long coat
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that one. Hmm I guess there's not always a method to their madness then.
---
Check the r/ market 76 sub. Best place unless you want to slog though the XB "LFG".
---
Vid too long got bored and started watching netflix
---
They were trying to get a head of the issue but can‚Äôt seem to sort it out.
---
No one fucking cares mate. Piss off.
---
I also had a quick dive into your post history. I see you are very quick to suggest purchasing atoms, fallout first or ESO+ whenever you can.
---
I seriously question where you stand at at this point. If you are not being paid to do this, then you are wasting your talent.
---
i feel you. same on ps4 ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Because some people sadly enough are willing enough to buy it.
---
If we want to change micro transactions it starts with us, don't buy into them, or even don't get the game all together.
---
Bethesda did mention they were looking into adding more camp budget for Fallout 1st on private servers in the future, its one of the first posts on their site when Fallout 1st was released. Can't find it for you as Fallout site banned where I'm at since site blocker blocks anything related to games and reddit mostly uneffected lol but does block pokemon reddit.
---
What's the question?
---
They have? Very cool!
---
Yeah, I don't doubt it would be for private servers. Less load and all.
---
Sorry hit post by accident before finishing
---
There was nothing subjective about anything I said. Just because it doesn't fall in line with your minority opinion, doesn't make what I said any less accurate. Neither does a page and a half of you repeating what you've already said. 
---
What you believe is only shared by a small, vocal minority of the playerbase. That hasn't changed, and grandstanding on Reddit isn't going to get you any closer to what you want. Truth be told, nothing will, because companies don't cater to the noisy 2% of the playerbase. They look at the numbers. Fortunately, now that there is actual revenue for the game, maybe they can afford to divert some resources into fixing some of the minor issues that have been in the game since launch.
---
&gt;You're getting lambasted for approaching a shitty situation from the perspective of a realistic adult
---
Sadly that is the case more and more in this sub. I don't think it's the case in this thread but in many of the most vitriolic ones if you look at people's profile and post/comment  history they do not play the game anymore...or ever for  some.
---
Ah good to know. Chameleon definitely stacks for npc. That's easy to show, but haven't had more than one harder to detect cham piece. Jon's video on the sbq is kind of proof is does stack too.
---
Just uninstall. Play fallout 4 and  realise just how bad fallout 76 is
---
I have some trapper and robot pieces, helps on rads, I use sleek I think it is and dense chest mod. I pop a diluted rad-x for sbq and whitesprings etc
---
I love that they sell for 5k like hot cakes lol
---
The Atom shop is designed to bait you into spending money to cover the difference between what you've earned by playing and how much an item actually costs. They don't expect you to spend $18 for paint. They expect you to earn about half or more of that through gameplay and then spend $5-10 to cover the rest. 
---
Which is still too expensive, if you ask me. Cosmetics should really only be a dollar or two each. They'd probably make more money in the long run, as I think way more people would buy them, but companies are always concerned with short term profit instead of building a sustainable income. 
---
No idea why.
---
Screws, gears, Springs, flux, aluminum, adhesive. Are the main ones that I try to load up on. Everything else I keep at a minimum. What platform are you on?
---
I guess they have not banned people with over 10 years of experience dealing with and litigating over contract law before. Or if they did, that person probably did what I did and just concluded it wasn't worth pursuing. I was going to make a thing of it when my ban came in. I even spoke to a buddy of mine about it, who was my attorney for years. He confirmed it and offered to pursue it, it is just a lot of work to pursue a case like that and not worth my time. At the end of the day, everyone who has been banned would likely be entitled to a refund of their purchase price and any money spent on atoms. Not just for FO76, but any Zenimax games. Not a lot of money per individual. Plus, it would likely bankrupt them, and no one would even get that. It is just one of those things that is there, could be pursued, but not worth it to anyone except someone who was just really pissed off and was willing to go through all of that out of pure principal.
---
Ps4
---
I didn‚Äôt know he could come to  white powder, flatwoods or mama dolces! Could you specify exactly where? Like where do you go after fast traveling to these points?
---
PSN tigersmhs07
---
Feel free to add me if you need some help. Maybe I can help you in game
---
What's a good number of those items to keep on hand?
---
I can usually find him qujte frequently but when i get my brother there so we can server hop him to respawn his items he usually drops dead after a few tries each but i have had him stay for a cpl hours a few times
---
Once I‚Äôm home I‚Äôll get some empirical video of what I saw last night and get it over to you
---
Yeah I bounce fissure sites and hit surface to air events for legendaries now.
---
Out of the ones I mentioned, as much as you can. Everything else I kept up like 50 just in case. But then I got a scrap box so I pick up everything now.
---
Bloody unyielding, all you need for pve. I know you discuss the mechanic of gear in stealth. People have been claiming that wearing full weightless or chameleon increase stealth. I‚Äôve never seen the point to even test that though, Since unyielding give boost to specials which I have actuall use for. Only trade off is low hp, but stealth outweigh that, according to me.
---
&gt; This game doesn't even deserve this post. 
---
And yet here we are...
---
Also, talk about burying the lead :)
---
I purchased mine on October 23rd, but when I checked my account the other day, my renewal is scheduled for the 21st.  I'm assuming they use a 30 day cycle and the 23rd falls on a Saturday so that would make sense?  I'm guess I'll get my updated Atoms possibly tomorrow since they will charge my CC then.
---
Tbh I've only watched the vid on my phone and it looked a little blurry, couldn't even make out his dead teammate names. But I do agree, if he were using aimbot then he wouldn't have missed as many headshots. One or two sure but someone was able to get completely away and died later
---
Adjusted for Fallout Universe inflation.
---
It was pretty random when it cleared for me.
---
I only sort of made a connection with the Meat Hook,because usually i use a 50 Caliber Gun.That was the only thing different that time.
---
K
---
Especially since private servers let you play with 8. Shouldn't have two groups. Hell even the server capacity needs an increase
---
To claim those shit currency first you have to delete your characters and they will reapear when you pay the one year shit subscription :D
---
Just letting you know that completing expert on meltdown and washout are very hard. My experienced team have not been able to do them. There is not really room on them to have someone tga along for expert
---
Are u spamming them? Like learning one after another really quick? That would do it. Try to slow down next time. I k o it‚Äôs a pain but if u do anything too fast on this game u will crash.
---
Here.. Have a bunch of extra quest markers!! oh, you were looking for which one? lol
---
I'm on PC but no thanks, don't waste time with me, I wanna do stuff on my own :D
---
Not sure if this is a bug or intentional but its been annoying me lately.
---
Weapon sensitivity is reduced when zoomed in first person but does not reduce when zoomed in 3rd person. I like to swap between the two but 3rd persons not practical unless I'm just fooling around.
---
I'm flattered! You felt the need to stalk me! :)
---
I've suggested to several people that if atoms had been bought more regularly, that the game wouldn't have struggled as much financially, and might be in a better position to avoid things like the subscription. Again, companies exist to make money. They aren't charities. This is a far cry from suggesting they buy them though, so that's misquote number one.
---
I've defended fallout 1st, I've never answered anyone's question with a recommendation that nb they buy Fallout 1st though. Once or twice I've said "buy it, or don't" because it's optional. Misquote number 2!
---
ESO+ I have recommended to people who are struggling with managing the plethora of crafting components in the game, or who want to be able to play through the DLC while they level. It's a great value for the money, much like Fallout 1st. A large chunk of each player base feels the same way.
---
If you're going to quote me, atkeast get it right! Youre
---
do u still enjoy this shit? i mean game?
---
I fucking love this game, go play outer worlds with the other neck beards sweetpea
---
Yo, real talk, you have not missed a day in the past month to defend every single thing Bethesda has done.
---
Do they pay good? I could help out.
---
It seems they have nerfed how long he lives. I was buying stuff from him and he just dropped dead. Definitely not able to reload anymore.
---
O, as this game :D
---
i'm on pc, but thanks for the thought!!
---
It's a slippery slope...using anything to automate your character could give an advantage over a player not using it
---
Just keeping you from afking...ehhh
---
Using it to mass farm materials from 24/7 running workshops with scrapbots at each one...uhmm
---
Whoa, be careful with requests like this. ESO players pay $50 for the privilege. You can't even earn crowns in that game
---
Yea I have 3 of the signs &amp; don't use them because of their budget cist
---
why you love this game? give me something and maybe i would love it too, share with me your knowledge
---
I only afk'd at one workshop. I didn't even know you could use scrapbots at workshops.
---
I remember when people complained about display taking too much space. My camp was a toy shop with 15 displaying racks, furniture, lights, posters, etc. People complained about being able to put just two or three max. They give us more than enough budget.
---
Cant we just be happy they arent selling us new mechanics.... oh shit. So much for cosmetics only.
---
" Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as expanded building areas, **increased C.A.M.P. budgets** and Workshop persistence. "  
---
You gotta' pay them for increased camp budget, buddy.
---
You can find them in-game, though they are rare
---
While is is greed, it isn't even smart... 
---
People would pay more money to be able to buy a lot of small things that dont actually cost you resources than they would for 1 small thing that doesnt actually cost you any resources.
---
That would be nice. Interior walls would be great as well.
---
I run a Trading Post and my teammates run other little shops so we try to build as close as possible. But being closer wo could have a little shopping plaza so to say
---
Again, you insist on making a false reference about me. When I happen to get on reddit, and I see an ill informed post, such as one you would likely make, I correct them. Some of them. I don't have time for all of you morons.
---
Now you're reducing yourself to just calling me a shill, which is even more pathetic. Get out of here.
---
Thanks. Now I just need a free hour to sit and try and figure this out.
---
&gt;intellectual discourse is the theme,
---
LMAO. Oh, that was a good one, broke out laughing in the middle of a meeting with 20 people present...the odd part is several people joined in laughing for no apparent reason.  I think the folks I work with are a bit unstable....sorta like Reddit.
---
I try to keep at least 50 each of those items.  You'll go through them fast when you start crafting (or repairing) weapons.  Might also want to keep about 10 each crystal and circuitry.  
---
 If you haven't made excavator armor, you'll need to start saving black titanium.
---
A bit of copper, depending on your camp power requirements, and what PA mods you want, but don't have.
---
&gt;Duped back in January
---
Stay banned, please.
---
Oh, I was wrong for that. I don't disagree.
---
Atoms literally = $$$, dude.
---
I'm wearing mine with the yellow fasnacht beret
---
The wilderness, camp building, playing dress up, grinding for the perfect set of armor and weapons.  The interaction with other players is awesome, especially helping low levels.  The pace of the game is amazing because you can take your time to do anything and everything you want.    Just the overall atmosphere is what got me hooked.  The bugs and glutches dont bother me at all.  Im on PC and barely disconnect so i just dont see where all the conplaining is coming from.  I am an FO1st subscriber as well and dont mind paying the 12.99 a month.  Bottomless junk box is awesome too.
---
Auto rifle with perks wins games, it's not even a contest of what the best weapon type is. Shotguns are also viable, but only the combat shotgun. I use heavy guns because that's what I got saddled with before you could pick your own perks but even without perks shotguns/rifles are better on average than most of them
---
I don't. And that's why I left.
---
And that's why you got a warning...
---
You're at the top of the slope today it's one workshop....in a week you've slid halfway down and have claimed them all and built a scrap bot at each
---
They would have to make changes to the shared perk system.
---
I think my game is Bugged.
---
When i activate the tadpole challenges.I go to all the places to do the tasks,there is nothing,no pointers,not a thing.
---
Have done all the exams.I even have 1 Badge from Camp Fire Tales.
---
Yet for the life of me i am unable to complete any of the challenges.I know what they are,where they are.When i go there nothing happens.
---
Lamp: If I turn it on, have it stay on until I turn it off. Location change or fast travel should not turn it off. Since others may like the current behavior or even the opposite (always turn off on location change), I'd like an option in the game settings for it.
---
Scorched+poison: no idea. Could have been one of those wrongspawns where the mob spawned as humanoid scorched but the behavior was of a mirelurk king. Happened near the building for the Glassed Cavern mine exit. Will see if it happens again.
---
&gt;I've bought the game four times over its lifetime. I understand the ban on the first two for the duping.
---
You have a very serious character flaw and I highly doubt you understand what you did was wrong. Your actions have actively soiled the experience for others, and I doubt you care about anyone other than yourself.
---
Okay, Biden.
---
That sucks! Though asking someone to meet at a workshop to do a trade feels suspicious to begin with... Glad to hear that you made out of there without giving up the goods.
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
&gt;so all that's left is "or pay"
---
You forgot the option to just move on and not get it? Or perhaps, having not bought every new item as soon as it came out, you had saved previous saved atoms? Just a thought
---
I would go under the assumption on the day that your subscription renews.
---
Thanks for the info, doesn't sound too onerous.
---
Looks like used shit. Why did they change it?
---
Exploring the caves and everything else for all the easter eggs is cool too.  Plus im at the moment lvl 130 and still havent launched a nuke yet....one day, too much other stuff to do at the moment in game.
---
&gt;They need to get that money. 
---
They need to get that game working right.
---
I wish that thing we're 1/4 as common as the white wolf hat, I think I have 1 beret
---
That's quite the leap in logic.
---
You wouldn't even give your own brother a bluth banana stand  power armor skin
---
Never build that terminal thingy, time to give it a try!
---
It has literally absolutely nothing to do with supply *or* demand.
---
There is an infinite supply because they literally cost nothing to copy. The demand is for there to be accessible skins for their items, and there should be as many as there are for Fallout 4 (free, btw) since they already made millions off of the power armor models they created for 76 (as recycled FO4 models) and since they literally made a verbal contract with everyone specifically saying 76 would **always** be free with *no* micro transactions.
---
lvl 651 here or some shit like that i stop counting it, i just dont have anything else to do. Tell me something else
---

---
Here you go errrrbody, I make this run several times a day
---
Atom challenges are account based, not character. It gets harder because once you get higher up, the only way you end up having to get atoms is the daily/weekly stuff.
---
ok millennial. don't like it don't pay it.
---
I bet it has an even higher price struck through above it.
---
Agreed, I often run with 5+ players.
---
What my thoughts were to be able to have Squads of 8 so you are still friendly and can fast travel, but you can only receive the benefits of perks from 4. 
---
Sadly I don't think this would even be on their radar.
---
I had to buy mine from someone else.
---
The game is weird that's for sure, so many events and dailies just never appear for me then a whole load over and over üòë
---
I did not expect to be dead weight; I usually prepare myself with a lot of Stimpaks, so I can fix myself most of the time, and revive others when needed. I could also help with enemies and objectives, I can't just beat the timer on my own. If expert is out, is the same true for standard or novice? There is a challenge objective for each separate difficulty.
---
I keep one armor, one high capacity, and one radiation backpack on me all the time.  Only 3 pounds.  Mostly use the armor.  Switch to high capacity after doing a run and getting full.  Use the rad one for sbq sometimes as I get to close to the rad edge and it helps.  If I want to go in I‚Äôll throw on my xo1.
---
Howdy, I am one of those peeps and I can confirm that we're still digging away. We have 3 Bethesda CMs in our Discord who appreciate and vouch for us. The four who had accounts suspended are still with us, as well.
---
No clue man, i dont play as much as you i guess.  Sucks they delayed Wastelanders but it was probably a good idea.  Just play Wastelanders until then if you are bored.
---
Okay. For working with shotguns, is it worth a slot to take Skeet Shooter? My main problem with shotguns is losing the range battle at anything other than point blank fights, but maybe SS might help extend that somewhat.
---
You know what.. it would be good if you're right, and you've gone to the trouble of making a video of it (thanks for that by the way) so I'm def going to try again.  It's hard to judge one way or the other using short term tests but I think I'll know after giving it a week of play time.  Wish me luck :)
---
I dont think the dailies have gotten harder. Just more repetitive. There are very few that take me more than 30-40 min to do them all and only a couple that make me have to server hop
---
Like I said, you have my PSN. I have a ton of junk that I could give you if you needed any.
---
Thanks for the tip!  So ridiculous this hasn't been addressed.
---
‚ÄúWell Fortnite charges $20 for some skins!‚Äù
---
‚Äîtheir logic probably
---
Yes basically the higher you get, the less stuff you can unlock that only gives ATOMS the first time around, easiest example are all the "reach level X" ones.
---
You still have daily, weekly and monthly stuff, but you have that too while you play the first time around, so the dropoff is definitely noticeable.
---
If you play every day and try to finish all the "quests" that give ATOMs you can still get quite a few, but not nearly as much as "i can buy whatever i want every week!" at best i would say you can get maybe 2 high price or a handful of medium to low price items each month if you really play constantly.
---
Of course, of course. But leaving Fallout 76 to die would mean never again a Bethesda online game for many of us.
---
Does the game on PC support controller?
---
Thanks for this!
---
I have a small cabin in the woods, and I'm at max CAMP budget with barely anything.   My 3x3 floor is all foundation with floor tiles on top and pointed angled roofs.  Sounds like if I restructured it, I could free up 25% of my budget!!
---
I spend most of my time building my CAMP and I had lost my desire to even log in anymore since my little cabin was maxed out and I kept seeing all these other grand builds. 
---
Is there any good resource for CAMP building and using the budget to max potential?
---
: )
---
In its current state i would say maybe 20-30h unless you build a lot or focus on pvp stuff or whatever. Just doing quests, especially the main quest, gets you quite a few levels rather fast.
---
I‚Äôm sorry to sound rude but I really have no interest in this debate. Not really the guy to talk about it with. üòÖ
---
the interaction with other players? if only they seem to know how to talk or even have a mic, because i love to send an emogi and get one back it means so much, if i find someone with microphone its lucky not to hear an eternal gun machine shooting from nowhere. 
---
but ok man im happy if you enjoy the game even if they cut launch content to make you pay for it later.
---
For those who missed it, it's [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dyn5qc/atx_datamine_november_19th).
---
Exactly the same for me. :-(
---
Have completed everything other than those Tadpole challenges.
---
From reading Posters threads on here i have visited all the locations trying to force the challenges to Spawn,nothing.
---
i love some of the random scenes theyve putt in there. ive seen this before but never linked it to twd. awesome!! makes sense too
---
Yes. Although it has some limitations with some specific hardcoded bindings.
---
" Again, you insist on making a false reference about me.  "
---
What is a false reference? You behave like a shill, you get called one.
---
 " and I see an ill informed post, such as one you would likely make, I correct them. "
---
My post is illinformed post how? You still havent answered me once why you defend a company for free. And then you insult people. Very mature of you.
---
You have no arguments, you spout bullshit as if it our JOB to make sure a video game company does well financially. You are either a shill or are somewhat handicapped.
---
Check the scores and replies to your posts, there is a reason why they happen to be negative. You seem absolutely delusional. Remember its ok to like a game. It is not ok to INSULT people when they dont like being overcharged or their issues are left unresolved.
---
You don‚Äôt have to be so hard on this guy, it‚Äôs just a game, plus he said he regretted his actions, you don‚Äôt have to keep on belittling him for it
---
What's more interesting to me is you made the video to prove your point.  I don't think it's right, I think chameleon works, but you *have* convinced me to re-validate my beliefs so job done :)  thanks intrepid
---
This guy is actually attempting to point out character flaws in others. I wish I had some popcorn when I read that. Missed opportunities.
---
No problemo. No worries. Better to be honest.
---
It gives you like seven+ different options to complete the task. It's not that hard
---
There is also an option on PS4 to delete the locally saved data which might help before going the whole uninstall/reinstall route.
---
Just make sure to save any photos that you've taken b/c those will get wiped out. Ref: [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/42916/\~/what-do-i-do-if-fallout-76-is-crashing-on-ps4%3F](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42916/~/what-do-i-do-if-fallout-76-is-crashing-on-ps4%3F)
---
Yeah - I‚Äôm pretty good at the ‚Äúhide and seek‚Äù aspect. Move carefully, stick to cover, know the terrain. Barring accident or stupidity I usually end up in the top ten just by remaining unseen. 
---
The challenge is that, eventually, you get discovered (or see a choice target), and at that point I‚Äôm basically a dead man unless I get lucky.
---

---
This is what I do. I have a controller that was experiencing some analogue drift. Bought a new controller and now this is my "farm limited events while sleeping/ keep my workshops in private" controller.
---
They should be adding secret quests and items without announcing it to let the community find them on their own. It would give the game a continued sense of discovery.
---
You can sit on a banjo and avoid being kicked from the server, I've done it alot, especially during mischief night. I'd do the event then set my character down for an hour and repeat.
---
We really just need a full blown guild system.
---
Perk sharing as a feature is going to wreck any bigger groups.
---
Actually its zenimax
---
And it's going to take money to get it working right. Developers don't work for free.
---
Killing is my my business and in my business, I look good
---
I am totally fine with them just removing it (it makes no damn sense anyway) if it means we get larger groups.
---
Standered can be done with someone who doesn't know it as well. It's not so much that you be down a lot, the objectives and knowing the lay out is huge though
---
Ask zenimax, not bethesda
---
I keep no more than these numbers: 200 steel, 100 lead, 100 plastic, 100 screws, 100 aluminum, 50 of everything else.  Bear in mind as you learn the map and level up you will be able to gather a lot of mats in a short period of time so even these numbers are a little high.  My gf for example survives on less than 20 of each thing and doesnt even bother with things like antiseptic or gold/silver.  She does just fine.  I just like to be prepared.
---
Lol thank you. Interesting. But please delete this. I don't want some twat on here reporting you for afking.
---
Sorry my bad I didn't realize the pedants are out in force today, I'll make sure to include meaningless nuance in my next comment
---
Now I can agree with that. Abandoning a game is rarely good for a companies image. It would take a lot for Bethesda to come back from that. Many companies never do.
---
Uranium fever has three guaranteed legendaries but none are max-level, sadly.
---
üò•
---
Really? I could have just sat playing a banjo üòì
---
Good info! Unfortunately, I‚Äôm lacking every single one of those perks other than Master Commando. (I‚Äôm level 18 and the RNG perk gods have not been kind.)
---
Of Frog Legs, Bloody Mess, and Tank Killer, what do you suggest as an ‚Äúorder of priority‚Äù to get? I have 9 ‚Äúdupe tickets‚Äù I can use, so I can get at least one right away. (I would think Bloody Mess provides the most bang for the buck; Tenderizer might beat it, but I don‚Äôt have 9 CHA to use it.)
---
Lemme guess, I'm just a Bethesda fanboy?
---
yeah that makes sense. ty.
---
I better not piss you off or else you'll hold your website hostage again.
---
what?
---
What fix did they sell? I still lag glitch and drop from games to include the private ones
---
I don't think they'd have to change perks. Just leave them at the current Max effect.
---
Idk I'm just so used to saying anything that isn't negative to Bethesda and everyone's just like bEtHeSdA fAnBoY, so I just kinda assumed
---
Haha I deleted it. But yeah if you do that it won't log. I crouched on the roof of Whitesprings for the Halloween event and went to bed. Figured the game would crash out pretty quick or that server would shutdown but nope woke up and my dude was still spinning. Now I use it in private worlds if I need to run an errand or something.
---
Yeah lool. I tested it different ways. I stood around, and the afk message would come up after about 15 or so minutes. Then I tried the tinker bench and that worked a little longer but the message still came up after awhile. Then I sat down on the banjo and that last the longest. I've never gotten the afk message while playing the banjo and I know theres been times I've been off for over an hours.
---
Yeah I haven't heard of anyone being banned for using it either. Most mods people use just seem to be QoL changes.
---
Which console? PS4 Pro has super sampling and boost mode that supposedly help with this. I've found the biggest improvement to be an SSD though. Basically the quicker it can dish up game content the better things run overall.
---
Ok. I'll add you. For now I am trying to get rid of junk and aid and plans and stuff I dont need.
---
Good to know! Thanks. And someone else here just mentioned that playing instruments keeps you from being logged out as well!
---
They said updates would be free and they have been everything utility in the atomic shop is free or can be bought if you choose.
---
There are some Youtube videos that let you study things in advance and gives some time-saving hints. Which you probably already known, but I felt I had to mention it.
---
Well atleast let me have all of your stuff before you delete your account.  Got anything good?
---
Half december event was point out. But events are meh.
---
You didn't get the context.
---
Omg same!
---
76.
---
How are you ok when most the content for this game is being thrown into the shop lol. We are going 6 months now without anything substantial but a damn br mode and crappy events.
---
My camp is right at one of his spawn points, not listed in the video.
---
It's on the same road as Alpine River Cabins, just a little West of that.  If you keep going West you'll pass a pickup truck on the side of the road.  A little farther down are some overturned (tractor) trailers.  The area between those two things is where he can spawn.
---
In watching this video and seeing her do the run at Flatwoods, it really stands out to me how the road just past the Red Rocket has been reused as the road in front of my camp.  The truck is even in the same location.  Only instead of the part with the Red Rocket, it's those overturned trailers.
---
Sharing perks is really the only valuable reason to group with people. Otherwise you're better off just using a third party chat application and everyone running Lone Wanderer perk. 
---
There are a few really good perk combos now in a group, not that many people use them.  I would not want to lose those
---
It's very simple.
---
You ever go fishing? Lot of fish in a lake, right? Most are small, not worth eating. However, there are a lot of decent sized fish too. And some enormous ones. Turns out, those enormous fish can feed you for weeks. How you catch giant fish? Giant lures.
---
But Merle didn't die there. Failed easter egg?
---
I ran the numbers and did some in-game testing, and it looked like I could get up to 3x more damage with bloodied at ultra-low HP vs. Junkie at full HP.  On the other hand, I didn't have to worry about face tanking pretty much anything I wanted...  It did change my preferred weapons for big kills like the queen - Junkie's LMG, Ultracite Gatling Laser, and Plasma Gatling (all primed) were great though.
---
Having up to 7 perks shared with you from your team mates compared to 3 perks would cause some balance issues.  Most of the content isn't very hard  to even need more than 4 people as it is.
---
it would also cause new triggers with things like Medic's weapons - which for those who actually run support characters can enjoy using.  
---
It would also create some issues in PVP especially given the low population capacity of the server.
---
Exactly. You can spend all day talking about how things should be and complaining they aren't that way. But in the end, if you're still playing and taking about it, they'll keep doing what they are doing.
---
Shared fast travel points, perks like team medic and rad sponge, there are other good reasons to group up.
---
WUT?
---
Fyi, for anyone still not aware, the terminal can also be used to find the tourist.
---
That's been an issue for months
---
Who cares about xp and caps?
---
Pay to win
---
I don't think literally means what you think it means.
---
Atoms can be earned in game for free, therefor your statement isn't true, dude.
---
pretty sure those are client side, so removing them wouldn't help unless you are running the game on a potato in which case dropping the settings to lowest possible would yield a better result.
---
People looking for stuff to complain about
---
Found in someones vending machine.
---
My damage numbers definitely reflect the sneak damage notifications. I also run a stealth commando build.
---
Thanks for the advice. What about aid?  I feel like I carry around way to much of that stuff and should sell some or just get rid of it
---
I love how ESO is posting on twitter notes about them trying to fix current issues with the dungeon finder and events and people still are whining and insulting them xD . Regardless I wish Beth was as talkitive about problems as they are.
---
Doubt you could do it
---
Honestly I think the whitespring was supposed to be exactly as you have suggested but the game never evolved into that for a multitude of reasons.  I suspect a heavy culprit was the fast travel points not being inside as you suggested coupled with people nuking the ever living shit out of it lol
---
My camp is also right next to Alpine River Cabins!  The Spooky Scrotum!  I put it there to get a little more ambiance with the scary noises!  Also on PS4
---
More like +5 PER -3 INT +50% hunger
---
Grow up...
---
The value of shared perks is far greater than shared fast travel points.  Rad sponge is even better when you can share it with others.  
---
Nevermind the other effects like having to go back and change other mutations like Empathy that would otherwise be pretty broken in a group.
---
Also 4-people raids? I've seen larger group instances.
---
I know this has been said before in this sub but I'll say it again. Bethesda doesn't care about you, the consumer. They've proven this time and time again with predatory business practices, releasing nothing but broken content that serves no purpose other than to exploit you out of your money. I wanted this game to be good, I wanted it to get better, I wanted Bethesda to learn and grow from their mistakes, but their actions are clear. *They don't care about you, the consumer. They care that you give them your money and that is it.*
---
I'm on PS4 as well and haven't experienced any crashes lately but I also try to allow the world to load a bit after fast traveling and move slowly over that bridge to let the random event load in smoother.  Also, if you have FO 1st then I'd recommend spawning him on your private server.  I've been able to hop back in and out of my private server and get up to 5 transactions with him before he dies/disappears.
---
I like that Fasnacht happened around when it actually happens in real life. I don‚Äôt think they should run that again yet. Seasonal events for thanksgiving and the holidays would be cool for sure though. Maybe add small quests to earn the remaining mounted heads. Or a new TNT dome key quest.
---
I've paid more for a decent screw tbh
---
I'm on XBox, so I unfortunately will not be able to investigate your spooky scrotum.
---
Please no magic stuff, theres enough games that deal with magic
---
Mutations already need a balance sweep, I see no problem with this.
---
Explains it all.
---
For me it was the slocum joe's sprinkle donut.
---
I want it to be clear that Battlecry Studios is owned by Bethesda Games Studios. It is a branch of BGS, BGS has 4 teams, Maryland, Austin, Montreal, and somewhere in Texas I can't remember. 
---
Maryland is the OG team. Made Skyrim, Fallout 4, etc.
---
Montreal made mobile games, Blades, Shelter.
---
Austin has a specialty in online games and according to the NoClip documentary in charge of 76 and working with some BGS devs, particularly Todd Howard.
---
Dallas (I think) worked on the VR versions of Skyrim and Fallout 4. Nothing has been said of what they do now.
---
Vampire and furious on fast weapons, instigating on heavy hitters. I usually used tse, fe, gatling guns, fe 50 cal, instigating ss and furious meat hooks. Anti armor is good as well. A vamp Submachine gun or full auto of any type is great for your off hand weapon, just switch to it when you need to heal.
---
Those are all great points, and I agree. A "one stop shop"  at WhiteSprings would really benefit everyone, with the grinder, crafting, NPC vendor shops and a section of player shops would be perfect. If the fast travel point went inside it would also eliminate the worry from spawning in a nuked resort.
---
Price them high so you don't accidentally use them, but also so no one will buy them away from you.
---
If they get more money selling PA skins at 1800 than they do with those they sell at 800, then they'll keep selling them at 1800.
---
It's not exclusive to Fallout76 though, it's a wide problem affecting every game with MTXs. They all have like 20$-worth skins. Dead By Daylight, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Guild Wars 2, you name it.
---
correct me if im wrong but didn't they say in an announcment before or maybe during a wastelanders delay a month or 2 ago that theyre looking at re doing the atom shop and or challenges?
---
There's been two skins so far with the NCR ranger, original brown and riot green. Not at PS4 to check out that weapon skin pic but if it's not brown or green it's probably a tease, they do those often in the pics of other items. Like the new display case shows a fall wreath on the wall beside it, that's a tease
---
I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs available yet but can only assume it will be later down the future.
---

---
Every green dot in the forest can spawn the vendor bot.
---
\+1 Endurance on armor still does nothing right? Bugged since launch.
---
Nope. Not yet. 
---
They've done that in the past. Unreleased items seen in promotional material of other items only to be released afterwards. 
---
Most assume it'll be a 1st reward a little later.
---
With the dailies and weeklies you can still get about 5 bucks a week.
---
Oh, yeah buying a similar skin for less actually is voting with your atoms so yeah do that lol. I bought the Arktos and Sleigh bells ones for much less than 1800 so I guess I'm doing my part, never spent 1800 at once
---
Thank you, it‚Äôs just the actual outfit (basically just an armoured version of the NCR ranger outfit) looks really nice, I hope they do release it soon...
---
Oh, that‚Äôs interesting, you lose a lot of damage from going Junkies rather than Bloodied. :)
---
That's interesting, don't think I knew that. I've heard of him dying from grief killing but I've never seen him just drop dead, that's good to know when I find him I need to buy/sell quickly.
---
I hope so lol
---
It isn't. It has additional shoulder pad armor outside of the overcoat.
---
Hopefully
---
As of now the NCR ranger outfits are Fallout 1st only but I think there's at least two other skins datamined
---
win what? not a race is it. more like pay to save time not juggling around with a full stash box for half of my play session
---
Hrmmmm! Probably one of the ones datamined and definitely a tease. Good find by OP
---
Sometime I will take you up on that offer!
---
The shit people saying, really?
---
Well the Atop Shop listing specifically says NEW lines, at least when I was looking at it yesterday. Bethesda really needs to do better at their Atop Shop descriptions.
---
I doubt they will ever let people run servers on their own hardware for several reasons.
---
&gt;That's one person who bought it. Didn't care about it's price, just went and bought it. And that's just one person. There's so many more that behave the same
---
So, I've got to ask, what is it to you how anyone spends their money? Why do you feel you have any say in it one way or another? 
---
I'm not saying, one way or the other, if the price is too high. That's for each person to decide for themselves,  you have no right to tell people how they spend what they've grinded for worked for.
---
Whomever told you that is wrong and they are mostly mistaking the ‚Äúcopied‚Äù Atom Shop description from the other Liberty Prime paints. 
---
It‚Äôs referring to the fact that the power armor has any voice lines. Not that these are distinct from last time 
---
All the liberty prime paints share the same lines.
---
They are getting mixed up because of the Atom Shops description‚Äôs wording
---
Ive been having this issue too... Thinking best way around it is to switch from primary to melee, then log out. I know, more stuff we shouldn't have to do but means we log back in with a useable weapon that requires no reload and can quick change to primary, fully loaded.
---
You don‚Äôt have fallout 1st. Fallout 1st members get into games first /s
---
They've walked the "just cosmetic" reference that you all keep misusing to state that they are giving the community what they want.
---
Honestly, you can't go wrong with any of the three. Frog legs may be my first pick?. Extra damage is good, but mobility/evasion is much more usefull to me for surviving. Tank killer is great vs marine and PA players, but only usefull against armored players. Bloody mess is a 15% dmg boost to *everything*.
---
Your SPECIAL stats will be the determining factor, frog legs takes 9 AGI, bloody takes 9 LCK, and Tank killer takes 6 PER, so no point in rushing a perk card you can't use for another 4-8 levels.
---
Every stash lags for me whenever I'm adding or removing grenades or mines. Game slows to a crawl every fucking time. I'm about ready to just drop the damn things instead of stashing for selling later.
---
I'm close to getting it, just from saving up alot. Last thing I bought was the Plague doctor mask, I had like 1600 or so, got the mask and was around 1300, and been saving up. Got 1580, only reason I want the armor is cuz it's Liberty Prime. 
---
But the price is pretty crazy for how not crazy colored it is. Needs to be more than dark and have different dialogue on top of the items in the shop sucking.
---
If you are grinding quests you will be given so much more aid than you need it's not even funny.  If you are farming or grinding creatures you will have to get crafty and cook.  If you dont have speed demon mutation you can probably get away with 20 food items and 20 water.  Stimpacks should be less than 20.  Other chems are less than 10 and I only carry the 2 I use, vendor the rest.  EXCEPT antibiotics/disease cure.  I carry at least 20.  Preferably 30.  I dont use rad x but radaway I keep 10 diluted and 5 reg.  You will pick up radaway like no bodies business in this game dont be afraid to vendor some.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what people meant.
---
As I understood it they were asking if you could ‚ÄòDisplay‚Äô things.
---
I've made this argument about a million times on different posts about mtx's. Obviously they are selling them at an acceptable rate, or they'd lower the price. If someone wants to throw money at a game, then let them. Everyone else reaps the benefits in the form of free DLC. If you can't afford it, you can't afford it. Get out of other people's pickets.
---
This exactly. Believe me though I‚Äôve had some weapons I‚Äôve done this to before.  Put a bloodied explosive mini gun in my machine for 25000.  The VERY NEXT person to show up to my camp buys it.  It was on sale for 3 minutes. I thought no one would buy it. But here I am thinking I undercharged.
---
I was getting +16 strength in PA in a character I was leveling last weekend. That then changed to just +8 at some point. No idea what changed it.
---
If you take shotguns as a primary, skeet shooter is basically *required*. Significant boost to dmg at range. As a bonus, shotguns also work with the Gun runner perk in AGI, so 20% speed boost when using one.
---
Games been out so long  sure most of us have done most of them i know i have
---
Guild system would be welcome.
---
Love the Murgle. My pistol packin'mama lives here, because she loves cats. Cat posters, cat paintings, and the cat lamp that looks like it is holding a balloon.
---
Oof
---
 I play this game alone since the launch, I had forgotten we could share a perk.
---
I dont even know how it works exactly. :/
---
A bunch of non pvp cry babies!!!!
---
Learn to sneak. Its not hard. Resist from sprinting. That = death!!!
---
OP
---
Bethesda
---
One has a clue, the other doesn‚Äôt
---
you could also ask "why do you think it's cool to lock highly-requested features behind paywalls &amp; subscriptions"
---
because bethesda knows idiots will buy it, that's why. the phrase "sunk-cost fallacy" comes to mind.
---
Yeah we really need one.
---
That's pretty much how it works. If they don't make any money selling a single skin for 1800 atoms, that will effect what they charge down the line. 
---
However, if every other player you come across has the skin and you constantly hear that prime voice everywhere, then chances are they will keep charging that price for it.
---
Can you put atom shop paint on those suits?
---
do you have the dodgy perk equipped?
---
When I did the quest some high lvl people came and killed everything, including me, before I could finish it. Now that I'm a higher lvl and have great gear (which I earned not bought) I ask them first if they would rather do the quest. Bottom line is if someone finds out I can make something they want and ask me to do it (if I can either with their help or having them or me buy the rescorces) I'll do it to help them out. Again I point out I make nothing (last two things I made I bought the stuff and gave the finished product to them free). Call it what you want. I call it being nice to people which in this day and age is very rare.

18 DOLLARS FOR BLUE!!!
---
FOR FUCKING BLUE!
---
I like this idea, it would complete the look / feel.  I already have a vault boy cardboard cutout behind a desk near the machines lol
---
I do not.
---
Thanks for the response. Holding off buying any cosmetics in the Atom Shop for now since my preferred armor is the Trapper Chest. Looking forward to getting a fix :)
---
Well in 550 Combined you failed to remember that Full Charge is no FC use for Sprinting (Or being over encumbered) the part in brackets being HIGHLY useful. Power User is great for Gatlings Ammo.
---
Sturdy Frame is useful for carry and or Armour, now if you live in your PA, then you may feel that you don't need it, and thats okay. I also, can (create and) over repair my Armour to 200%, yet despite not living in PA, have repaired my ExPA twice, and also my T-60 once , in 180 levels (Granted only pieces not the entire suit).
---
Don‚Äôt buy it. Not like they‚Äôre forcing you to. 
---
Also if you are diligent and do all the challenges you get plenty of atoms for free.. it‚Äôs not like atom shop items are unobtainable without spending money. You all pretend the high prices are the problem when in reality all you want is all that sht for free. Let‚Äôs not pretend otherwise. Which is totally possible through challenges. Argue if you want but I really don‚Äôt care. Save your money for some Preparation H. You young gamers are all butthurt these days. #Sad #Hashtag
---
don't store aid.  get in the habit of carrying what you need with enough of a buffer so you never run out.  I usually carry 8 stimpacks for example, and maybe 12 water.  My income of those items offsets my use so much that I sell the excess when I get near a vendor to get back down to 8 and 12.
---
The numbers might be different or you but hopefully you get the idea.
---
More items in the atom shop than in base game for camps by now.
---
good question if like to know why we cant display alot of atom shop items
---
Try a cheap solid state drive
---
It‚Äôs your hardware or your connection mate, nobody but you can help that
---
It also so happens that there was actually a audio Easter egg that actaully led to it. Starting in Morgantown. Only 2 spots in game that ive seen world spawn nw large chests in adventure mode. 
---
I think they were originally trying to make nw a unlockable gametype after following the quest, but ditched the idea in efforts to gain publicity when it went f2p for those few weeks.
---
Then stop, because you're making the wrong argument for this conversation. It's not about 'can't afford it.' It's that Bethesda is releasing microtransactions for a game that still requires significant fixes and improvements. If the game were in tip-top shape, I could give a shit about microtransactions.
---
The BETA had microtransactions! The BETA! And now the game is essentially still in beta and the microtransactions keep trucking along without any issues.
---
Weird bug. did you try removing all perks, weapons, gear, and logging out? In other words get naked and reboot the game...
---
Sorry, I meant 79, the new vault tied to wastelanders update. Edited original comment
---
Trying that now. AP bugs are the ones I've run into the most, usually it doesn't go down at all. üòÖüòÖ
---
Exactly
---
Ooo that would be cool if the bay window worked like a display and you could display junk on it. As a matter of fact even if they added spots to tables and shelves exc that acted as a display spot would be better then nothing.
---
Dallas is working on skyrim very special vr edition
---
My melee character uses a b/ss power fist and meat hook as a backup.  Despite the addition of gladiator perks and higher damage on paper, the meat hook does less damage against heavily armored opponents than the power fist with a puncturing mod.  Armor penetration is kind of a secret weapon, so I‚Äôm transitioning away from the hook.
---
Because of the talon mutation creating a multiplicative effect for unarmed when coupled with other bloodied build effects, slugger and gladiator just can‚Äôt compete.  A combat knife build is pretty good, but the extra 0.5x steak damage doesn‚Äôt make up the difference.  The swing speed is still fun, though.
---
I use all unyielding armor with a mish-mash of leather, metal, combat, robot and scout.  Ideally I‚Äôd like all forest scout, because I like the way it looks, it‚Äôs classified as sturdy and the dr is very respectable.  I avoid trapper, raider and marine because they don‚Äôt have shadowed mods.  Heavy versions do seem to perform slightly worse, so I prefer light and sturdy if I can get it.  
---
Below level 23, I‚Äôd just go for heavy armor with the best DR I can find.  Until you can max out sneak and add in shadowed/muffled/ultralight plus legendary effects, enemies spot you so easily that it‚Äôs not worth the sacrifice to survivability.  I‚Äôd only start really shedding defense when I have the armor effects and agility score to really stay hidden reliably.  I know it sounds crazy, but I‚Äôd consider 20 AG low for a stealth build.  30 is good and 35+ is excellent.
---
If you feel squishy past level 50, using the bloody build perk trifecta of blocker, dodgy and serendipity will help so, so much.  Playing bloody with modest DR, I use full strength stimpaks, and eat one as soon as I take a hit, if I expect more to come.  I‚Äôm using the latency of the healing effect as a regenerative asset, which will continue to heal if I take another hit before I can end the fight.  I‚Äôll also sacrifice nerd rage by eating a diluted radaway to put me over 20% health if I know I‚Äôm about to take a pile of rad damage.  I‚Äôm still doing 500-700 per bullet even without it, and will get stronger as rads accumulate.  They say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
---
If you‚Äôre talking about carried weight, I‚Äôm not really sure.  Carrying 200-300w will make you easier to hear, for sure.  I‚Äôve learned to play without hoarding, only keeping what I absolutely need and trying to stay under 130w even with two rifles and 5000-ish ammo.  That‚Äôs about as low as I can go without any weight reduction perks or armor effects on a rifleman.  Aid items are also kept to a minimum, because those get really heavy very quickly.  Finally, I use herbivore mutation and rarely carry cooked food, which saves a lot of carry weight.  I just pick up berries as I go and avoid gaining a well fed bonus if possible.  That health drop can come at inopportune times.
---
I hope that helps.  Feel free to DM me if you have any other concerns.
---
Why not just put in your stash? Why don‚Äôt you want to use them?
---
The reason is that your power armor works more or less like Tony Stark's suit.
---
When you're not using it you only carry the frame... when you deploy it you activate Enclave's satellite that sends you all its parts. The game doesn't render this action because we already have general lag problems; this was promised to be fixed after Wastelanders.
---
I wish this was the case, because I have Fallout 1st!
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm experiencing the same 10-20 second delay in entering.  I suspected I was loading slower and was able to confirm last night.  Loaded into and area near the Power Plant at the bottom right (surprisingly only 1 other red dot player picked that area in the selection map).  The person had time to loot a small crate and pick a safe inside a shack east of the Power Plant.  I watched as he ran North into the distance.  Easily would have taken 10-20 seconds for him to loot the small crate and take time to pick the lock on the safe and still get the distance he had.
---
I can agree, though the analogy isn‚Äôt quite right. Atoms are a sales-driving product. We‚Äôre essentially getting two Big Macs for the price of one solely in atoms and the scrap box would be one of several orders of fries missing from the bag
---
This guy gives good advice.  What I did when I was in your situation is start collecting plastic (get the magnifying glass on it), and I bulked everything down to 50 except lead and steel.  Then I started selling the bulked items to robot vendor every day till I got my cap limit.
---
Alternatively just make a mule and dump all your stuff you think you may use eventually on him.
---
More recently ive been being dissapointed by nuke sites, in terms of legendaries. Ran ws after a nuke and probably got less than 10 legendary ghouls in 15 or so runs.
---
I don't care if someone wants to buy some microtransactions. I disagree with rewarding Bethesda by buying them, when the game is still in such bad shape, but beyond that, no, I don't care. People can by what they want.
---
My issue is that Bethesda is releasing microtransactions for a game that still requires significant fixes and improvements. If the game were in tip-top shape, I could give a shit about microtransactions. I already said this in my original post, just worded differently.
---
Ah. I see.
---
Someone messaged me and I need to clarify something. When I say I charge them what I mean is : say a rescorce cost 2c each to buy from a vendor. I charge them (maybe on how they have treated me or friends I don't charge them) the 2c each for the rescorce. Never do I charge them more for the rescorce.
---
then that's a head scratcher.  There's no change made to the game that causes ap to only drain in combat with no other cause.  maybe try unequipping every perk and storing every single item in your character in your  stash, then see if it still affects you while in combat completely naked with no perks.  
---
If so, then sadly a bug report would be your best bet.
---
I think they talked about it in that ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go whaling‚Äù video.
---
Create premium priced items so whenever they go down in price (eg promotions) you‚Äôll feel pressured to not waste the opportunity to spend $10 for an item regularly priced $18.
---
I already knew most in-game shops where scammy but that video opened my eyes to techniques I had never considered.
---
Ya.. what is this 1/3 the size of regular server stuff?? Bethesda thinks people who play this game can't do math. 8/24 = 1/3. I'm paying for the pay-per-view stuff, I want a bigger server. Having the options to control it from the web would be nice too, like a regular server i.e. "spin up", "shut down", "restart".
---
you can share any perk for 3x it‚Äôs cost in CHA. (e.g. you can share a 3* inspiration if your CHA is 9 or more, allowing everyone on the team to get 15% extra XP) 
---
it‚Äôs great for perks like Squad Maneuvers which allows everyone to move faster. With good team coordination, it can effectively give everyone more SPECIAL to work with. 
---
For example, if i share a level 3 bloody mess, i‚Äôm boosting everyone‚Äôs damage by 15% and allowing them to free up those 3 luck points for something else, such as Serendipity or One Gun Army that they may not have slotted.
---
It seems like, just as in D&amp;D, most people treat CHA as a dump stat in this game
---
What is this, a server for ants??
---
I ended up building a hi-dive at my camp, with a sign saying Revive HLP needed. Leg wep for HLP. Only took 15mins and some random helped me out.
---
Stop giving in to them.stop spending your hard earned money on nothing.they should have given us the wastelanders dlc.this game is dead right now.dead.
---
Great to know. thanks
---
I had popcorn that time. :) , thank you.
---
I stopped playing the game a while back but that doesn‚Äôt mean other people can‚Äôt enjoy it. Leave them alone and take your bullshit elsewhere.
---
Bethesda: *does AMA*
---
[Reddit:](https://imgur.com/sZ4wVX7)
---
Well you get a solid amount from challenges. But I mean the 1200 the give for free with 1st
---
Agreed. Level 5: You have reached level 5 and can now engage in pvp. Would you like to disable pacifist mode to enable this?
---
And rather than adevture vs survival, have server selection based on pacifist mode. Pacifist on=server 1. Pacifist off=server 2. Changing from on to off=you will need to exit and reload your game for this change to take effect - server change time.
---
Thank you for telling it like it is.
---
The general gaming community needs more critical thinkers and less 'positive' thinkers who buy whatever is put in front of them without a second thought.
---
So now we need to rebalance perks, items, mutations, challenges, etc.....for how many people? What % of players are even in groups of more than 5?
---
95% of the time I‚Äôm solo or in a group of 3 or less, and i‚Äôm not seeing a ton of players that are even grouped when I‚Äôm out and about
---
is that really high priority over all the other issues?
---
I don't *even look* at the atom shop for the camp, because if I buy a single thing I cannot put it in my camp without taking something else out, and I like my camp.
---
How the fuck did you not list +250 DR while reloading breaks main legendary effect?
---
Because they will be used on accident if you're saving them for something, if they are priced in your machine, it won't auto use while repairing.
---
'Scuse me they finally fixed the floating bushes I never noticed or cared about, isn't that enough. ^^lol
---
I know I have good internet(200+mb/s) so it shouldn‚Äôt be that. I think I have an extra 1tb laying around somewhere so I‚Äôll try that out and see if it makes a difference. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
You know for a pedant you're remarkably bad at keeping up with context and following conversations, your sort is generally good at that kinda stuff
---
awww, did I hurt your feelings?
---
I dont play bloodied, so no, I probably couldn't
---
yes, the truth is harsh, sorry for you
---
really the main thing pistols ned is just some analogue to tank killer, incisor, or stabilized. They are the one and only class of weapons with no perk that grants AP and for this reason and this reason alone they fall behind other weapon classes.  
---
The additional bonuses of those perks above also help to pull other weapon classes ahead of pistols so imo I like your suggestions but I'd maybe tie them into an AP perk.  So like "grants ap and also allows 20% faster weapon swap to another pistol" or something like that.  Each rank increases it.
---
With extra salt, I'm sure. ;)
---
you will mock them for buying a skin? who says its a a problem? do you really need to mock others to feel better about yourself? seems like a pretty weak approach from you no matter how you break it down.  live and let live
---
I found 6 in 30 minutes yesterday. It was absolutely insane! Best thing they‚Äôve done to this game in a while imo.
---
it‚Äôs really an under utilized system.  There‚Äôs also some great team mutations and perks that go with them. Empath makes it so teammates take 25% less damage but you take 33% more, which can be countered if team mates have Empath.
---
herd mentality is also great in a group, giving you +2 to all stats.
---
you‚Äôve probably seen these playing, but they can be beast when your group plays around them
---
A case of the meat sweats one too many times? Hahaha. Unfortunately I did not get to participate in Clean Appalachia. Wasn't it like a community thing where there was a goal to kill X number of Scorched?
---
No you didnt hurt my feelings or anyone's feelings lol. You just look like an ass is all :p
---
Did you know, I got 1 month of gold for my xbox for $1, and then paid $1 more to get 3 months of gamepass. 
---
For $2 I played the whole of The Outer Worlds and now I'm playing Rage 2. Logged into Fallout last night for the first time since the Halloween event released because I wanted to pick up the Halloween plans as I didn't play. 2000 caps for the reaper cut out? 700 caps for the pumpkin plan? Yeah. Logged straight back out.
---
$18 on a skin? Lol.
---
Shame is i'm finding them tough to solo with my sniper build solo :(
---
They van also be purchased with money... there for it is
---
.
---
The cork board in Van Lowe taxedermy has notices posted that begin quests that unlock them. The scout master at Dolly sods has quests for the bug trophies. The wendigo trophy quest is started by finding the newsletter on the patio table at the Southern Belle motel.
---
I still play the game, just not as much since i see it becoming more and more a free to play game since the atom shop no longer is about esthetics and now includes items that allows you to skip the grind
---
Yo i did the first run of liberty prime skins because it was that much for two and i wasnt happy about spending that much in the first place and then they double the price altogether for a nothing paint job. I like baseball, but i‚Äôm bad at calling strikes, but like STEEEEERIKE!
---
thank you! i originally thought that the Dolly Sods quests is where you got them. i‚Äôve done that same quest 100 times lol
---
Helpful thing is throw on a maxed out fireproof perk card and you don‚Äôt have to worry about scorchbeast sonic attacks.
---
Can you buy non atomic store items with them?!?
---
But you would say that promising on multiple occasions that your full priced video game will be purely cosmetic, backpedelling on that within 5 months, then doubling down whilst ignoring any pushback, is okay as long as it keeps the game alive?
---
Yeah I killed a 3 star one today and was working on two 1 stars afterwards, but then game crashed.
---
Op means like a display case
---
haha! I think this EVERY TIME! It makes me run away from the power plants, no doubt. So tired of that sound and the dialogue and animation.
---
Why does it bother you what other people do with their money?
---
Seriously? It‚Äôs not even in the display case tab, why would anyone think it works like anything other than a table?
---
Yeah, my bad....no cost for sprinting...still useless for heavy guns or melee as AP runs out before that anyway....To each his own...My heavy gunner uses neither of those cards and I never have to repair my PA or in need of fusion cores...  As far as Sturdy frame, still useless, IMHO as my standard armor does not weight that much and every piece has weight reduction perks....So, if you have the right build and carefully think it out you will find out that those two cards are absolutely worthless with the right build and mutations
---
Unless I'm brewing up some alcohol, I rarely need to boil water. It's very plentiful in the wild if you keep your eyes open.
---
I also rely on my 3 small purifiers. I empty them out (2 purified waters per unit) whenever I stop back at my camp.
---
nuke the base.  It's the only way to be sure.
---
Wasn't the arrangement for screws tho?
---
wow, yeah, I like that. Much cooler than the glass displays.

I‚Äôm surprised nobody said *‚ÄúfaLLoUT fiRsT sUbScrIbeRs‚Äù*

HORSE ARMOR NEVER FORGET!!! [https://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Horse-Armor-Pack/00000000-0000-400c-80c0-0000425307d1](https://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Horse-Armor-Pack/00000000-0000-400c-80c0-0000425307d1)
---
I read some are not released yet, though can see them in the crafting menu. This correct?
---
Yeah, hammering down the number of scorched should have encouraged other survivors to move back to the area, but nobody showed up .....
---
its a shame that thats what needs to be done to avoid this
---
I am right there with you, but the community was totes fine with the repair kits. I was fighting that battle and we lost hard. This is at least workable and I way prefer it to the alternatives.
---
Yeah, a whole bunch aren't released yet.
---
same its so bad
---
All of those thing really need rebalancing anyway.
---
you forgot the emojis mate
---
They've got a stack of cut content, why not turn it on? Give us *something* to do!
---
My god! It‚Äôs almost like Bethesda is a business with the goal of making money!!!
---
Hmm... I understood him to say that they were putting too much time into the Atom Shop and not enough time into actual content, which frankly I agree with. Surely with the time they spend developing new textures and assets to add to the Atom Shop, they could add a little bit of scripting and create some new events?
---
I look at World of Warcraft. Like, vanilla World of Warcraft fifteen years ago. Off the top of my head they had a major content patch what... every 2 months or something? THAT is how a live service game is supposed to be treated. To me, Fallout 76 feels like it was launched and then forgotten about. Like all this time went by and they forgot the servers were still up. I'm exaggerating, but you understand what I'm saying I think. It really feels like the bare minimum is being done to keep the game up. And that's coming from someone who has actually had fun playing.
---
Haha touche
---
actually saw this myself just now. they were red, but I didnt walk in front of it to find out if they had truly been infected by some commie virus or not. was a meat pile on the stairs so they obviously shot something recently.
---
I played a ton of Forza Horizon 4 for that 1 dollar month. And the game works well too.
---
What do you expect? Bethesda already proved they could care less about the fans with fallout 1st. Even THAT was broken at launch. Smh
---
Yep, one of my turrets turned against me after the patch, too. It was promptly destroyed by another one of my turrets. The issue is being reported to the devs.
---
I haven‚Äôt completed the tadpole quest(s) but did find the high capacity one. Don‚Äôt know how or where I got it but I did the once a day note section purge of plans and it was there.
---
That's the same. It's the same thing.
---
For months now I have had to reload my gun on startup.
---
Yep yep we seen your name over there and decided to say hello.
---
Neat, was pretty funny lol
---
Thanks for the heads up! Had never seen that one before!
---
They wont ever do that, but frankly, i dont really mind not having a scrap-box.  
---
But I wish i could see how much each section weights both in pip-boy and in my stash.  
---
And ability to fast travel to my camp regardless of being over encumbered. So i can farm faster if I need a specific material.
---
Why use a throwaway for this though, you using Reddit for naughty stuff?
---
Why not just play FO4 or Outer Worlds to kill time dude? FO4 has a cool creation club update tommorow.
---
pretty sure "buff" is in BGS's vocabulary the same way "Three" is in Valve's
---
It‚Äôs been done before for magazines and bobble heads. I think it‚Äôs possible just a very daunting task that they haven‚Äôt yet figured out fully
---
i found some last night but do you have good melee legendary to sell? trying to get a good melee build
---
Yes. Constantly maxed out.
---
They mods put up a post talking about the backlash to the decision. The community wasn't fine, BGS just didn't care.
---
I don't want the game to die, but letting them rewrite history, and accept what amounts to lies, is not something I can get behind. Have a membership, but give the scrapbox and tent to everybody. Hell the gas mask from first doesn't have -2 PER, so they're starting to let you pay for items as well
---
Not sure if it still works but, you can also use the command to open your friends list, then hit Esc as soon as the loading screen goes black. That (for whatever reason) will load you into the game a few seconds faster.
---
indeed.
---
@op: it's not rocket science.  bigger camps cause a negative impact to server performance.  So whatever suggestion anyone can come up with for bigger camps all funnel into the same roadblock.  
---
At the end of the day CAMPS are meant to be small, but you can definitely make a nice camp if you embrace the limits and focus on making the best setup you can within the boundaries you are provided.
---
Ah, so I should be hoarding Buffout, Mentats and Psycho to be able to complete the 5 chems challenge; cool, thanks for the tip.
---
Bethesda does not support modding yet for Fallout 76. 
---
Maybe they finally implemented some controls to prevent third party mods from working. 
---
The mods you have been using are unsanctioned and violate the current EULA.
---
You will most likely get no support for this issue, that is technically not an issue, because modding is not supported in 76
---
There are people that pay [5,000$ for a box of warhammer miniatures.](https://www.forgeworld.co.uk/en-US/Legio-Titanicus-Titan-Maniple)
---
20$ for a skin nothing.
---
He never said the guy was wrong. Was making a rather obvious joke because it IS just a matter of greed. He was agreeing with the guy in a light hearted and joking manner.
---
Oh, camp budget is able to be increased, they'll be releasing it for Fallout 1st soon, they already confirmed it just working out the kinks
---
The camp budgets are being increased for Fallout 1st subscribers.  It can be done.
---
Whether the new budgets will be available in Private Worlds only or it'll also carry over to Adventure Mode isn't clear yet.  They haven't said.  Details will be coming along eventually.
---
Actually they've removed some of the Atom rewards for the easier challenges and replaced them with other rewards, like  bulk steel for scrapping 5 weapons or some bulk wood for harvesting 50 wood. These are the per character challenges as well.
---
funny, my feelings of you are just that as well..., have a good day my fellow ass
---
They're gonna be releasing increased budget and also size for Fallout 1st and I'm not kidding at all
---
better, go to nexusmods.
---
Soon as they are it will be in F1st, I'll grab the post where it mentioned that
---
Thats a top-noch fallout idea but I highly doubt they will ever do such a thing cuz its so awesome.  
---
Ive had the idea since i placed my first camp. A craftable bunker door or hatched basically, lockable, so friends or anyone can come in.  
---
Also should withstand a nuke blast.
---
&gt;you know you could just make a game fun and please your fans by offering cosmetics through in game quests and challenges
---
There is plenty of that as well, ones that cannot be bought in the atom shop regardless of price.
---
I was there man. For every one of us fighting it there were three people talking about how it wasn't a big deal. I can see why they thought it was okay to blow it off.
---
The community is just reaping the rewards now.
---
Yup, this alone puts that whole defense into question.
---
I used to do customer service for a credit card. One time this guy called in really pissed that his card had 600 something dollars in what he thought was fraud. It turned out that the whole thing. Every single cent. Was $1 buys from some Facebook game his wife was playing. And then I shared with him about the 300 some odd dollars in pending charges for the same thing. 
---
The point is, Bethesda, lower your dang prices and I‚Äôm certain you‚Äôll make money hand over fist.
---
 they should do it, it would be more entertaining than any in game content lately
---
even if that is true, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily make it worth the effort to balance for groups larger than 4 if not a significant portion of the player base would even use it
---
Does the armour scream out the nonsense even when u cant see the enemy do you find? Can it point out enemies u dont see?
---
Also, don‚Äôt make the Beta a week or two before it‚Äôs release. Sometime in January and then release the final product a couple months later. But what am I kidding, they won‚Äôt don‚Äôt do any of that. Bethesda only cares about the Atomic Shop.
---
Are you waiting for a manufacture to fix yours or do you need buy a whole new one.
---
It's really fucked, man. Like I see the defense still working for the scrap box because stash space =/= junk storage so they can still say they're having trouble increasing stash but it makes the budget and size issue defense scummy af
---
But I want to pay more money, I don't expect this to just get better for the same amount per month!! Increase cost to $25 a month for those amazing services, Bethesda! Thanks!!
---
With the addition of the ability to opt out of floating names I have high hopes that someone there is working on more UI options. We should absolutely be able to opt out of every flashy visual or audio distraction in the environment.
---
The public quest announcements are the biggest offender imo.
---
Should i feel nostalgia for the old theme or is that strange
---
Nukacrypt has a bunch of groups that compete to complete a silo the moment the codes reset so times will vary, Otherwise uncompleted silos will start displaying their first set of codes to crack on Wednesday inside the Enclave bunker.
---
These teams will normally consist of a code puncher (person who puts in the code), code checker/s (person or people who check to make sure the code put in is done right and remove it from the list) a key card runner (the poor person who has to have 3k worth of nuke cards and runs them down to the puncher), and nuke card hunters. So you should seek out these discords if you want to help or have the codes a few minutes before anyone else. I think the owner streams his runs.
---
I hope this is a quick fix that is handled with the next hotfix and not let go for an eternity.
---
This is just irritating.
---
Did not see this listed anywhere under the armor section.  I apologize if I missed it.  
---
I run a Chameleon build and just got a 3* Marine Weightless Sentinel +1 Perception right (I think) arm.  With it on, it blocks the Chameleon mutation from triggering.  Take it off and &gt;poof&lt; invisible, put it back on and visible again.
---
I run 3x bolstering and 2x unyielding on a bloodied commando stealth vats build. would you recommend me going all unyielding? I have the usual perks like blocker, Serendipity etc on. interested in soloing the queen myself. I have the firepower it's just the armour set up I'm not sure about
---
IVe been in cultist outfit since i found it in point pleasant around lvl 5. It was soooo spooky, and I felt like an NPC, I kept it up until i reached lvl 50 and got the Enclave outfit.   
---
I loved going around vault 76 and with a chameleon armor and scare new players XD and then drop them some loot for the trouble.
---
Run assault rifles with tank killer,commando, frog legs., bloody mess, lifegiver. Rifles are op in this mode especially the handmade

Ouch. Depending on the other effects, a BE minigun is worth 40,000-80,000+ caps.

Tip: You can prevent people from accessing a vending machine by building walls around it with no doors.
---
For scortch i get like 2400 dmg but for the Queen like 600 with crit, in like 7 min its down
---
How can you say a significant portion of the player base wouldn't use it?
---
There are zero metrics supporting that. 
---
I can say that almost any large group of people playing this game runs into huge problem with server and party access because of a lack of basic social tools like larger groups. I have seen it so many times abd it alienates people needlessly
---
Agreed, the whole fallout 1st subscription service has really poisoned the well and called their credibility into question.  I don't hate that they have it, but it's really changed their priorities in a bad way ( especially patch 15, which was really telling).
---
Ohhhh, crap. i forgot about the collars!   
---
I had many but sold them cuz i needed the caps. then i totally forgot about it! I gotta go and get one!
---
No way man that is raider territory
---
I support F1st but not certain additions they bring with it. Scrapbox sure, but the tent should have been for everyone
---
Because it encourages bad behavior that affects the whole game for all players, if I had to guess. It‚Äôs one thing to do things that only affect you, but when what you do starts to affect others, even tangentially, expect people to be upset about it.
---
I agree completely. I'm just unsure why you don't think it's an egregious breach of trust
---
Full Unyleding with ap its the best, you need more sneak so you can just spam criticals with ne problem, i have only 1 strenght and 2 endurance, all my poins ar in luck, agility, perception and like 8 in inteligent
---
Everyone affects everyone else all the time. Why is it bad behavior? On whose part?
---
I just run through harpers ferry and do uranium fever or AWOL armaments. Sometimes if prime is nuked, after SBQ, I just walk up to my camp in the mire and encounter a few otw, generals steakhouse and bogtown usually have leggos
---
not repair kits
---
The new thanksgiving table is the first table that items can be displayed on
---
Sole purpose was to get up a few levels, and learn a bit by watching. But don't worry, i stopped playing NW anyhoo.
---
I think OP was wondering if it was worth buying as a display case, so wouldn't know what tab it was under in the CAMP editor.  I briefly wondered the same thing, since the photos in the Atom Shop show it proudly decked out with a food dehydrator, plates and silverware.  Arguably a bit misleading, especially since another apparently normal shelf unit that went on sale at the same time will allow display of misc items.  
---
I wish they would make some tables, pedestals and smaller shelf units that did function as display cases.  Or figure out a way to just let you drop stuff onto surfaces directly.
---
Don't spend them on repair kits. Every time you come past a workbench, repair everything. Then you can spend the atoms on PA/ Weapon skins or stuff for your Camp
---
yup, you can throw on any ultricite paint, and any of the "all frame" paints
---
Right, it's not a deal breaker for me.  My issue is make the main experience better before asking for more money.  Hell, all I really want is them to have test servers, even if only on PC.  I play on Ps4 myself but I recognize how badly they are needed.  To me, that would go the longest in terms of showing they're committed.
---
Sadly, we're well past that. Bethesda seems to have realized they've burned through so much community goodwill that an AMA (aside from being unprecedented from them) would just turn into an orgy of deserved criticism. 
---
Their current strategy is to simply ignore the controversy until enough time passes. Or perhaps they've ceased support altogether, who knows. I honestly have an uneasy feeling Wastelanders will wind up cancelled and this whole circus act will finally bite the dust.
---
Camp stuff
---
I'm pro pay to win
---
I dont have 500 hours to spend hunting for the gun i want and since I keep picking up useless ghoul slayings gamma guns ........i wish i could craft legendary weponds or pay for one with real money. Why we get junk boxs and 5$ fridges i dont know
---
I do sell all my doubles. Trying to complete my collection. Ign sent on pm
---
Don‚Äôt actually use reddit other than now just heard I was mentioned here.
---
OP you know you can repair without repair kits, right?
---
agreed! only ever use them as an absolute last resort, think i have around 40 now lol
---
I didn‚Äôt realize they misrepresented it somewhere. When you look it over in the Atom Store it‚Äôs only shown with a flowerpot on it, like my photo. I added the cutout just to show you can put large things on it too.
---
Give it to firsters! *Hides from the mob*
---
Can you not earn the atoms? ;)
---
Nice, I can get unyielding powered gear no problem, gonna try it out. what is on your 8 Intelligence btw? I'm only running nerd rage on there now
---
I literally place single floor 2by3 metal walls, roof, and bunch of concrete walls, thats it... even tho i dont have many atom shop items, i really got tired of not being able to scrap items, getting budged banged etc.  
---
too many unnecessary silly limitations....
---
I totally agree. I think a lot of publishers don't do research on the elasticity of demand for items in cash shops.
---
Or if they do, they make the mistake of assuming that when they cut prices, if demand doesn't increase, it's because consumers are price inelastic (when in fact it's not price they are concerned with).  An example was Apex legends who tried to argue this point -- i.e. that prices weren't too high because if they were, why don't people buy more stuff doing sales?  What they fail to realize is that demand may be split between whales that will always spend and normal folks that hate RNG.  So it's not that the price is wrong, it's that RNG makes people not want to spend.
---
However, in the case of Bethesda where there is no RNG, i'm willing to bet that if they cut prices in half, they would more than double their sales (and so make more money -- i.e. the demand is elastic).
---
You had this account for like two years though, gotta have it for some reason. You looking over on the gaymersgonewild subreddit my guy? Sinful
---
I'm guilty of spending money in the atomic shop, but there is no way I'd pay 18 bucks for a PA skin that will drive you and everyone around you crazy while it talks lol
---
My numbers aren‚Äôt that high even with a bloodied ffr handmade but I don‚Äôt have all the sneak damage cards running.
---
I just answered your question, that‚Äôs all, but I will expound. Bad behavior on Bethesda‚Äôs part because they see that these prices go over well, even with the backlash, and they will continue to do it. It makes them more likely to put things behind a paywall that might otherwise be put in the game for free. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying that people who buy them are exhibiting ‚Äúbad behavior‚Äù - I‚Äôm saying that it enables it from Bethesda and that affects how the game is run, what items are put into it, and what they deem is ok to put behind the paywall. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt spend your money however you want, but don‚Äôt feign ignorance that your choices may perhaps enable or embolden the company to be less mindful of criticism and that might make some people upset that Bethesda keeps doing shitty things that seem to only benefit them vs being more pragmatic and toning down the greed.
---
Even at 200% a handmade with demolition expert and no gunsmith will break twice in a SBQ fight
---
WoW. the length people go for griefing...  
---
Maybe use a perk card that heals radiation? XD
---
 I can confirm that Cavalier's does not work while sneaking, because you can't sprint while you're crouched. Sentinel's also only works while standing, and you can't stand while you're crouched.
---
I've got a mod (perk loadout one) that's working just fine...at least as fine as it has been before the patch.  Haven't had any new issues since a few patches ago.
---
What about cloaking legendary? What effects are attached to that exactly?
---
If youre in PA, make sure you don't have the Stealth Torso Mod, that drains AP while crouched
---
Yup its more about the people that do pay and not so much about those that dont want to.
---
That's a good question for Fo76DatamineAMA.
---
It's an MMO, which means it *can* die. If Zenimax or Bethesda decide that the game just isn't performing how well they want it too, or is worth more keeping the servers up than financially beneficial to keep up, then they'll just shut it down.
---
I do not see Fallout 76 being around in a year or two if Wastelanders does not succeed.
---
No, they're capitalists for sure
---
no and no, as long as you have the full code figured out the pieces are not necessary 
---
 thanks to the hard work of many teams and a website you can look the code up.  the only thing you need each run is a new keycard.
---
Wow thats great to know because i used the site but farmed the codes! Thanm you!
---
Fallout 76 is on sale for black Friday at Best Buy for $10 so you could actually buy yourself a copy and your friend a copy for the same price as one skin. If we needed any reassurance that @Bethesda really doesn't care for us fans that are left this would be it!
---
AMERICA WILL NEVER FALL TO COMMUNISM!!!!
---
You don‚Äôt need the silo pieces from the officers. You only need a key card and the code for the silo you are in.   There is a cool down so don‚Äôt run same one back to back
---
No you dont have to decipher the codes in order to launch. If you go to nukacrypt they post them weekly. And after you enter the code once your good for that silo for the rest of the week, you just need a card each time.

I solo'd the queen about 4 or 5 times now on a private server and still didn't get that one.
---
Good to have a second/third weapon in case that happens
---
Repair kits are the biggest rip off in the atom shop! If you do the queen you get the good ones for free!!!
---
I recommend farming the Queen. She gives more and better repair kits than you can get from the shop. Paired with weapon durability perks, and you will never need to even use crafting materials to repair stuff, unless if you exclusively use things like fatmans or auto grenade launchers.
---
Are you talking about the 1800 atom power armor that you can get the atoms for free in game all of you complain to much why dont you move out of parents basements out of your peanutbutter forts and join the real world and stop complaining about something on game that you can get for free because  you did not save your atoms this game does not make you spend money to enjoy the game  the power armor is just a skin does nothing for you
---
The reason they do it, is because people will pay for it regardless
---
\*Don't think, just consume product, then prepare for next product\*
---
You think this is bad though? You know which game pioneered this mainstream greed, right?
---
Destiny 1. I remember during the very first racing event Bungie held, they were selling loot boxes with ridiculously low chances to get these 3 colored speeders. Except you were guaranteed to get one if you paid for the most expensive lootbox.  I had several friends brag about spending $100 to $200 to get all 3 speeders.
---
And those speeders were USELESS. They had pretty colors, that's it. And all my friends never used them, they just sat in storage
---
Shooting their mines doesnt initiate PvP? hmmm. that might be the best solution then.
---
Lol, I‚Äôm still wondering how they gonna do it without people trying to bring modded characters to adventure
---
Nope it does not!
---
I pretty much only buy camp items (and the very occasional outfit) but that's mostly because building and decorating are my favorite part.
---
I haven't played for a month maybe longer is there anything new? I was watching Netflix last night and a window popped up and said another patch was installed? I'm gonna jump on and see what's up.
---
I've been playing Death Stranding, super cool game! ü§†üëç
---
The prisoner collar stays on with every outfit! I absolutely adore it, haha.
---
so far I've unlocked the Bye Now emote for 50 of the free atoms I got playing the game.. that's it
---
if there were more useful emotes I might buy some since text chat is a loooooongshot
---
Last I saw, people were still asking if it works as a display. This makes me happy.
---
I want you to write my biography, your wording makes me appear so much better. lol
---
Finally found the picture I was remembering.  It was in the [Atom Shop update for Patch 15](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/01kmDuEu7AM5whFYG65K3p/atomic-shop-update-15-items-and-sales-november-19).  There were plates, a dehydrator and a couple books laid out on top, (possibly?) in an evenly spaced pattern.  (Guess I hallucinated the silverware.)  Makes me wonder if it was perhaps a display item that got downgraded for some technical reason.
---
Too bad.  Would have been a neat display component.  Hopefully we'll see more display items like the open shelf unit, anyway.  I'm proudly displaying model robots in mine!
---
Bruh, Bethesda was in legal trouble during the Christmas event from last year. Their Holiday items were discounted right? But said holiday items were never available before the discount, and the items were set to dissapear after said event
---
After reading the letter it mentions 'mouse controllers' combined with the fact that you state in the title of your post, you were using a mouse macro to keep a server open while you were afk seems like that is most likely what you got busted for. You asked people here why, Don't be upset with them for explaining what the probable cause is. Doing that to keep your multiple workshops running while you're not actively playing could easily be construed as an exploit
---
Its has begun...skynet has awoken
---
Where do you even get so much to craft?  
---
I craft or cook as soon as i see a crafting or cooking place, and the most i repeat is like 10 if i got luck.
---
The literal only reason Bethesda reads these comments is to siphon ideas like this, PLEASE don't.
---
Yeah that's the main mod I want to use tbh. managing perk cards without it is a nightmare, rest is retextures and sound replacers.
---
You know what, that's probably very true in this case. And the backlash that bathesda receives is probably outweighed in their eyes by the profits they make from selling a bunch of less pricey items.
---
I mean, the same people that they tricked players into buying 100$ subscription, with 0 new content for 6 months now and for the next 3 months at the very least.
---
What do you expect?
---
I've heard people talking about possibly getting the rest of the head plans during the December event (https://youtu.be/q0lnhSwK3ws?t=753)
---
Ok here's a weird one for you. I was farming plants to make disease cures, and specifically know that I went and picked at least 5 firecracker bushes with the green thumb perk on. Went I went back to my base, I didn't have 10+ berries in my inventory, I think I had 4 or 6. I even went back to the bushes to make sure I hadn't misclicked and they were definitely picked.
---
Oh dear god, pls don't waste anymore of your Atoms on those Repair Kits. I would highly recommend you invest in Weapon Artist and Scrapper for your perk cards. I rarely have to fix my weapons now. When I do need to repair them I always have plenty of scrap already on hand too. You're also gonna have a harder time buying them in future as you run out of permanent challenges.
---
In terms of buying things I would recommend first going for items with function, such as the Scavenger Collectron Station and Refrigerator to preserve consumables such as Pure Flux longer.
---
Also, try to find info before buying certain items such as the neon Rooftop Billboards as they have stupidly insane build budget.
---
Lastly, it's obviously best to wait for certain items to go on sale if you can hold your impulsiveness spending habits. I personally mostly spend my Atoms on CAMP decorations, but that may not be for you.
---
I do, and man do I respect them less for it. Pete Hines straight up lied and they have never even tried to make up for it.
---
But I have hope they will change for the better. I mean I wish I had more than hope, I think they have been really shitty to their long term fans here. But I am a fallout fan first, and even interplay was pretty shitty with the franchise at the end of their involvement.  My presence in the fandom will endure even if Bethesda never does a single thing more for it. 
---
I just see what they have done here (with fallout 1st) as dodging a far worse bullet than it could have been given the cart blanche for microtransactions that the community gave them with the repair and scrap kits.
---
I can't even describe what I was feeling when they announced that they were going to include more utility items in the atomic shop. I was literally sickened. But I was totally surprised when they sprung the fallout first subscription shortly thereafter. I was expecting something so much worse.
---
Because people are suckers, plain and simple.
---
Thanks for the response. I‚Äôd assumed you were attributing bad behavior to Bethesda but wanted to ask since it can be hard to tell on here. 
---
What if, rather than feigning ignorance, I just don‚Äôt care? What if I assume that Bethesda, as a company and like other companies, solely exists for profit? What if I believe their only goal is to make money and not to enrich my life in any way? What if I view their products simply I see the guise of ‚ÄúDo I like it? Do I want it? Can I afford it?‚Äù
---
If Bethesda is continuing mtxs and not reducing the cost, then wouldn‚Äôt that mean that they are selling them at the appropriate price? That they believe that they have found the ideal point where lowering the price wouldn‚Äôt cause enough purchases to make a difference?
---
Says the guy who already admittedly got busted twice for duping. You asked what you did wrong, he explained the most likely cause and now you're angry with him and trying to justify once again trying to cheat the system.
---
Thanks for the clarification! And I agree, we need more display options. At least one new display case was added today, it just WASN‚ÄôT a table!
---
Lol. The why is simple, because if people want it they can pay for it. It's 100% optional and the only thing that gives virtual items worth is rarity. So this is something someone either spent a decent chunk of change on or had saved up for weeks or longer in order to buy without paying cash for it. 
---
What I genuinely don't understand is why people are upset? 
---
I don't think paying $1500 for the new Razr phone is worth it, so I'm not going to buy it. It might be cool but not something that is worth that amount of money to me personally. Am I upset at Motorola for selling a phone for the value they determined people would be willing to pay? Of course not. That's absurd. Same with that new 8k tv or tons of other completely unnecessary items that exist out there.
---
OP isn't really making that point. Besides that, people need to realize that the team making the cosmetics isn't the team making fixes and improvements. There's a division of labor there and they can make a skin without sacrificing anything in other areas.
---
I agree on the Private Server part. I would like to have a little more control over who can join. Just because we are friends doesn't mean you can just pop in and loot all my stuff. lol. This happened to me last night. A guy that I met last year when we first started playing fo76 was in my private world last night doing events and I was just like "oh, okay."
---
I would like to have an "Invite" option. Like if a friend of mine is on Adventure/Public and I want to invite them to join my Private Server.
---
Also I would like the option to remove people. I like to do all trades on my private server, but then they always hang out afterward and I'm sitting there like "please don't loot Ft. Defiance before I can get there I still need that Pink Asylum Outfit!" LOL
---
just buy w.e suits u.  I mostly buy cosmetics and camp shit.  I dont buy repair kits coz im one of those that really like hoarding junk and repairing/crafting shit myself.
---
You must be xbox and I think I know who gave you the 1500 serums lol
---
They are hardly even adding things to the shop it feels lol
---
Because if only 10% of you people who complain about it actually buy it... then it's cool in Bethesdas greedy, corrupt eyes. 
---
Gamers have been stuck in this stupid cycle for years.
---
Those are the most powerful damage boosts in the game, so you're really missing a lot of damage without those. Rank 3 covert operative and rank 2 mister sandman will give you a 350% damage boost on all sneak damage at night (250% during the day). That's calculated after all the other damage buffs you get from weapon specific perks, legendary buffs, mutation buffs, and chem/food buffs. That's in contrast with the Better Criticals cards which are very weak because they are calculated off the base weapon damage stat. I reallocated some points out of luck into agility and quit runing any critical hit perks because of that. I'm doing the same damage numbers OXY23 mentions, but I have a BE combat rifle.
---
Sylvie and sons has heaps of wood. For water I just look for WS to get nuked, grab a bunch of flux with green thumb perk and chuck it in my stash until it turns into inert flux.
---
DID YOU JUST ASSUME MY GENDAR!?!?
---
LOL jk.  :-)
---
That IS lame, I really wanted the orange one but couldn't afford that whole package
---
At least for me, legendaries for Lever action rifles are much more potent than handmade. I have both two shots, but a well placed silenced lever action rifle shot does massive damage, around 700s, where handmade cant pass 300s. (my instigating lever used to make 980. it was so dope  and not even level 50. idk how 2shot cant really pass 800s. inaccuracy i guess)  
---
like others says, Adrenalin its so satisfying to crit any enemies. Im using silenced but just like New Vegas, the sound of the gun is pretty satisfying too.
---
I have a few in mine.  They sell out quick as I list all of them at 25 caps.    
---
IGN same.
---
I have no issues with that one.  It started loading *slightly* wrong a few patches ago, but it's an easy correction.
---
No change since the last patch.
---
Not sure if the n in [Archive]n is breaking something.  Check to see if the archive section needs to be updated, but I don't know enough about that to comment any more than that.
---
Dontt take every lost you dont agree with as an attack.  Nowhere did I state anything near what you wrote dude.
---
Well at least you didn‚Äôt waste your atoms then!
---
[nukacrypt.com](https://nukacrypt.com)
---
It's the way they act when conveying their point, not the point itself.  Seen plenty of legit slams and non legit slams on BGS and would call neither children because they approach the discussion as an adult and not an argument they must win.
---
It's the way people argue in here that makes them children, not their point.  Sorry if it came off as such, was not the intent.
---
That's what I'm saying.  This game wasnt built for fallout fans it was built as a MVP and to milk the ifiot shill fans who cant understand when they are getting fleeced.  The live service is the atom shop that is the end goal
---
Eventually they'll probably have a prescribed mods list like how it worked for FO4 on consoles.
---
I'd imagine you'd add mods which would then be saved to a personal server config file. From there, boot up your personal instance and be offered the choice of vanilla or your customized server.
---
Ya? List in game items and atom shop and let's see which wins
---
It‚Äôs a flat exchange, a level 1 3* weapon is 40 scrip, so is a level 50.
---
Good thoughts, but Bethesda isn't reading this and won't reply to you. They are full in head-in-sand mode.
---
They'll probably restrict modding to private servers and only subscribers can mod them, but anyone can join a modded server and use mods on them. Otherwise the atomic shop would be useless and they'd make no money.
---
I really hate melee is the obvious practical choice in this game. I like gun play.  
---
I usually do a sneak headshot, then when im found i use VATS, and then try to finish them without VATs. In power armor, i get AP recharge so if i miss regular shots, I immediately VATs them.
---
I am, and you're probably right üòÇ
---
That's a pretty neat idea, where everyone is encouraged to move camp to an area. Gentrification of Appalachia
---
I know, right?
---
I played this game since launch. Never noticed those.
---
Move along, I never said you had to pay for the items.  Shit dude, if you hate the game, why play it?!?!  
---
I hate metal gear survive but it's a waste of my time to complain about it on the message boards when what you want is not the kind of game fallout 76 is.  
---
All MMOs pull this shit so it's nothing new my friend.  Best way to show your distaste for a product or company's current direction is to speak with your wallet and just dont buy in.
---
This argument you make is no different than me berating taco bell because I want a hamburger and they only serve tacos.  It's a pay for vanity MMO.  I know its not what most FO fans wanted but its been quite clear since day one this is something new for the franchise and not all are going to like it.
---
I just posted on another thread this same thing but here goes.
---
Offer prebuilt structures. Less for the server to keep track of because it's not really individual.  This allows players to use budget for decorating or defense objects. 
---
Another option is to let us build in existing structures already in the game. Then we can, once again, place more stuff.
---
Quote from the Development Director himself :  "We actually have our list of the top ten mods that are used to play" says Mayer, "and we want to be very cognizant of that, because when players are using mods to play the game, that's a clear area where we can improve."   
---
Another Quote from the Project Lead of Fallout 76 :  "We're actually also actively looking at some of the more popular mods on PC which deal with inventory management," Gardiner says. "I'm just saying. We're aware."  
---
Plus if it we're against the current EULA, these specific mods wouldn't be allowed on [Nexusmods.com](https://Nexusmods.com) as anything that Bethesda disallows is not allowed here, such as ripped assets or mods that allow illegitimate advantage against other players, like cheats.  P.S Bethesda has people monitoring the website as well as Nexus Moderators.  
---
If Bethesda really had a problem with this, they would've contacted Nexusmods and asked them to take the mods down, And they wouldn't have made these comments either.
---
That‚Äôs fair and if that‚Äôs how you or anyone feels, at least in this example, it‚Äôs perfectly fine.  It will just obviously draw some ire of some and if one doesn‚Äôt care either way, then everything is awesome and there‚Äôs no reason to do anything other than what you‚Äôre doing.
---
I think they stay in your gallery
---
Yeah, it was working before the update so I dunno.
---
We need a bigger build budget, we need  a bigger stash limit. And we also need a bigger scap limit. 
---
Mark my words, this how this going to go down, in about 3 months all Fallout 1st members are going to receive all these things requested
---
yyyyyyyeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssssss
---
I agree it sucks but I mean I just figure while the 4 horsemen set is killer, it's not important enough for me to grind or pay out cash lol.
---
I guess I just am confused because if all cosmetics were easily attainable, hardcore players would bitch that there is nothing worth grinding for.
---
It's all a balance sadly.
---
Yup, I feel 100% the same!
---
I know what your talking about now, its not the end of the world considering there is still duping going on.
---
*76%
---
I figured it was related to the stars... But seemed incosistent, or perhaps I just didn't pay enough attention. I know I could google but since I am already writing... What are the rates for one and two star?
---
In game gallery or just playstation gallery? I know about the playstation gallery and hey atleast its something, but its not like Im opening that all the time
---
The game would show old pics and remind me off good times or just show a picture I thought was nice
---
But playstation gallery is better than none
---
I may pay $18 for Bluth banana stand power armor skin, but don't tell Beth
---
Well I definitely want more quests and mysteries. One of the bigger issues is how few interesting quests there are, and how short most of them are. We know they can do it and totally up for some quests more on the Lovecraftian end of Fallout, but honestly I'll take any kind of additional quests that involve more than listening to a holotape lol
---
They sell it because people buy it, if nobody spent money on that stuff they would lower the prices. But you see camps that look like flea markets, I'm level 259 and I still have about 2000 of my original atoms that I earned from level 50.
---
It‚Äôs generally my approach to companies. Sure, some want to help the planet. And, yes, some care about their customers. But at the end of the day, they‚Äôre in business to make money. Hell, even people who run big charities can make a sizable income. 
---
I get that there are likely people who want some of the items but can‚Äôt afford/aren‚Äôt willing to spend that much on them. And I get how that does suck for those people. But along the same lines, it‚Äôs an armor paint in a video game. It doesn‚Äôt matter at all. Mix that with all the entitled, ‚Äúgimme‚Äù whining (both people talking about F76 and in the real world) and it‚Äôs just too exhausting to try and care enough to make everyone happy.
---
Alot of content for the shop seems to be on hold from the Wastelanders Delay tbh
---
Er get it, you're nad you can unlock with cash.  So you're not mad they make you pay, you're mad someone with more income can have something you cant?
---
If that's an issue, you're gonna have a bad time in life.  There will ALWAYS be some sod richer and with more shit than you.  That's why life's secret is to find your joy where you can and learn what shit just isnt worth the frustration.
---
sure but only on private servers, where it won't impact server performance for the rest of the player base.
---
Your Edit makes me look stupid. XD
---
Thank you so much. I guess it was the combo of scripping armors and weapons that got me confused.
---
I'll give that a go thanks!
---
That is really scummy ask for a refund you will probably get it since the item you bought no longer work the same way that you bought it for... Its like buying a mac laptop and then next month it only works on Windows os..
---
Im level 284 and been playing since BETA... you need to hustle for those daily/ weekly challenges and you will have plenty of Atoms  to buy what you want.  If you want every item, then yes you will struggle to keep afloat. 
---
You do not need to buy every 1800 atom PA skin in the store.
---
Lol, I like you. :-)
---
Theres a map of random encounter locations, just look up Mappalachia on here. Im unsure if its the "Traveller" one or not, but it's be the same color indicator as the Charleston station
---
Sorry! Not my intention. Just wanted to clarify it üëç
---
I think they stay on both. Not positive though.
---
Yes
---
You know what really grinds my gears about whenever Bethesda does give us a 'freebie'? It's always on the Atomic Shop to claim, and if I'm not mistaken, it's temporary before being removed.
---
Like, come on Bethesda.  How about just adding it to the underwhelming list of CAMP items and outfits pool? Or just add blueprints to find? That way everybody actually gets it, and I don't have to go through your shop first.
---
It's just really damn frustrating.  
---
I've knocked Rocktar a lot for GTA Online, but damn man.  The way Bethesda handles their online service transactions is so far behind what Rockstar does.
---
If things were actually handled intelligently (baring just not having microtranssctions in the game), Bethesda's system would be like theirs, and instead of the Atomic Shop being the exclusive place to get hot new items, everything on the Atomic Shop could be found *in the game world through loot, and events*.
---
That way, people who want a shortcut can just buy Atoms and have the item immediately, and people who are content earning it can just play events and do normal game stuff and eventually get plans for things they want.
---
there‚Äôs also zero metrics supporting rebalancing for larger parties. That was my point.
---
Balancing the game the other way could alienate people on the other side.  If the content has to be designed to handle large parties then the people who want to play solo or in small groups will struggle more to complete that content.
---
this isn‚Äôt an MMO, it‚Äôs not designed with large group raids in mind, nor should it be
---
&gt;not even all of them
---
*take a picture of an Alien, not the flatwoods monster tho*
---
"Hidden Round"- grants a 10pct, 20pct, and finally 30 pct chance to not consume ammo. This could be pretty nifty if you are using revolvers. 
---
"Sound of Silencer"-grants ability to make all pistol shots silent. Make it a 3 perk minimum card or something.
---
"Sweet-spot"-grants armor piecing just like tank killer.
---
"Day trader"-boosts damage on pistols during the daytime. Thos would pair nicely with a nocturnal gun to eliminate it's weakness in the day.
---
thank you just added you.
---
True patriots don‚Äôt look at the price, they spread messages of freedom with their wallets üëçüèªüëåüí∞üí™

---
I hope you're wrong.  It's probably pretty hard for them to keep up considering 76 probably has been the most controversial game of all time.  That usually tells me that it may also go down in history as one of the best games of all time.  Sounds crazy but look at products throughout history that created so much love/hate and changed their respective industries. Like BMW iDrive for instance and the bangle design changes.....people hated them at first, even loyal customers but ten years later every manufacturer was copying their design and media interface ideas.
---
I hope you get that outfit!  Especially the Red one!!!
---
No worries, I'm just Messing around. Thanks again for your time and help.
---
Bethesda are drug dealers
---
What would you be saving them for? Aren‚Äôt they only there for crafting/repairing? I guess the only thing I could think is maybe saving up for power armor, but this still seems silly to me.
---
I regularly forget to eat or drink when I'm playing video games so I'd argue that this is one of the most true to life aspects of the game
---
PC player pop is very healthy. I assume it's the most populous platform by some margin tbh.
---
I like having a balance between DR, ER, and RR, plus I don't like looking like everyone else, so I use the Excavator arms (for the better mining), T51 legs, and T60 torso and helmet - or an X01 helmet if I'm feeling sassy.
---
Because that‚Äôs th a price accepted by the market.
---
FortNite makes over a billion dollars a year where their highest priced skins are $20 and get swept up by players without a complaint
---
No problem at all!
---
Fingers crossed my dude
---
That's a good look, I've rocked this before too.
---
Upvoting and bumping for visibility. I bought both of those bundles on the same day for that reason. For the fog machines
---
On Xbox it deletes last I did it. No idea if this was changed.
---
Nice :)
---
Flatwoods monster counts. If you can find the bastard. Harder than finding Wally.
---
Exactly I did the same I bought both bundles within a week because I wanted both the smoke machines at once..
---
1000 atoms to add more to the build budget.  
---
1000 atoms to increase carry weight
---
1000 atoms to increase storage limit.
---
1000 atoms for everything.
---
I honestly want them to do this.  Just go for it and really stick it to us gamers.  Go full EA on us.  *I dont play it anymore so, go for it.
---
Exactly I‚Äôm going to put a ticket in later!
---
I even have pics of both for any 1984 "we have always been at war with Eurasia" comments
---
Yeah, and the goals changed periodically and had rewards with them and themes. During that time a lot of players came together to work towards a goal doing things they might not have normally done. Saw more queen nukes during the scorchbeast week then in the whole month prior. Saw tons of high level players running through morgantown airport killing scorched. Gave people a reason to do tedious tasks because of a goal/reward. Sometimes I get on, mess around a bit and just get bored and leave cause there really isn't much to do for high level players. At least that gave me a goal to shoot for
---
Yeah, just realized after trying it for myself :/
---
It *is* hunting season...
---
I've never had him work for me, sadly. Both alive and dead. I always miss out on that 40 free atoms.
---
Yeah. Even on PS4 (no 3rd party assets) I could put any prefix on any weapon.¬†
---
People could come out with bloody explosive everything.¬†
---
Maybe even combinations that were impossible. Like explosive baseball bats or unyielding bolstering cavalier sentinel.¬†
---
Just as bad?  Are you fucking serious?  Where are the loot boxes feeding off of people's worst impulses?  Where is the DLC that's just repackaged cut content?  For FUCK SAKE all Bethesda is doing with this game is selling people skins and the occasional refrigerator and you act as if that's on the same level as Street Fighter locking half it's roster behind a paywall or Battlefront selling p2w loot boxes or all the other shit that is actually dragging down gaming.
---
Bushes
---
True, I was just wandering through there the other day and thought it looked cool. You could put it anywhere and as long as it was a community-based area, it would work
---
That's everyday of my life in the wastelandsüòÅ
---
18 bucks is wack.   Truth is, I  hardly  notice what other people are wearing.
---
Where the fuck do I say a single thing about having logs?  All of these details were provided BY THE DIPSHIT THAT GOT BANNED.  All of this is shit they've previously admitted to as their story has changed over the course of their little drama.
---
Plenty of people do
---
I bit the bullet and did it with this location...worked splendidly. Thank you for your help. I tip my cap to you.
---
Huh that's odd. I've only had that once in the time I've actually paid attention (was a weekly challenge back at the end of October) and it worked for me. Sorry dude!
---
You get the champion tokens and shards regardless, and especially when you make a new account. Its not 8 dollars a month, its 8 dollars every 3-4 months when a new event rolls out for one of the tournaments type of thing. PLUS when you level up you get champion and skin shard rewards for free.
---
I don't buy the event passes at all anymore, and I'm still getting a ton of champion and skin shards each month. I don't pay too closely of attention as I've been playing on a single account for the last 9 years. To give an idea at the moment I have 9 champion capsules sitting in my inventory (have champion shards they are the rewards for most level ups), 2 glorious champion capsules which are for each 10 levels gained and contain more champion shards, 7 key fragments, 10 normal chests, 30+ champion shards (not counting them all, haven't cleared them in the last month and a half), and 14 champion skin shards. The game gives immense opportunities to earn almost literally everything except what is locked behind the event passes. And I'd say you will earn anywhere from 2-10 skin shards per month that you play, I haven't cleared mine for a long time but have been somewhat actively recycling for orange essence.
---
Not to mention all new champions that come out are immediately available for what? 6300 blue essence? Which takes someone dedicated probably two weeks to grind out, which for a new shiny completely game changing release to be available for earned in-game currency that is pretty freakin cool.
---
Because of this for the last I think 4-5 years I have been able to buy every single new champion with blue essence or IP (before the overhaul) on release, by doing nothing more than playing a few games a day.
---
The development team is working on Wastelanders. We are still getting bug fixes and, yes, new Atom Shop items; but those issues are handled by different departments. Don't expect too much in the way of new content until Wastelanders' release. There may be a Black Friday Purveyor sale or Double XP Christmas week, or something like that.
---
You could argue that Sludge Lung does something like this, but Op had no diseases, yes.
---
How consistent is this?  Sometimes if a server is lagging bad, it will conveniently forget to both refill and deplete the AP meter.
---
Oi im not knocking on you here mate, perfect if you feel like helping out!
---
i love the easter eggs in the fallout games.
---
Repaid kits are a rip off you are literally throwing away your money if your on Xbox go to Lfg and join every queen fight you get repair kits for free and they repair 150% instead of 100% that you paid for I have 500 repair kits just buy doing the Queen and I rarely ever use them... If I farm the Queen I can probably get 40+ repair kits a day
---
If you play Pipboy games in your camp you can slap on the Happy Camper perk, I use it when I am spending a lot of time building.
---
I can finally finish my bar YESSSSSSSS
---
Nice. Yea I‚Äôm going to move some points around so I can get the sneak cards at least. Or try to get an unyielding/sneak piece of armor.
---
I do
---
I'm under the impression that you *can't*, which makes the picture very misleading.
---
It's only 18 dollars if you're stupid enough to buy it for 18 dollars.
---
They wanted 500 for the Fallout 1 vault boy pulshie wtf price is that 50 max 80 atoms for something like that.
---
What's a twat waffle, I would look it up but I am at work. Is it related to the blue waffle?
---
Let‚Äôs have a date. This kind of non-answer is bullshit. There‚Äôs either a date known internally for this fix or there‚Äôs not; tell us.
---
Thanks guys. Nabbed it.  I like it better than the other cases, although some items can be too tall.
---
I don't recall seeing it in the datamines, not that I claim to seen them all but I have seen some with the NCR outfit.
---
You mean like the entire filthycasuals community? üòÇ
---
I recently saw a post on there in which someone was bragging about having left this community and thereby ‚Äúdetoxifying‚Äù themselves due to how much negativity there is here.
---
That person made an entire damn post about leaving a community... who tf does that? Just unsubscribe and move on.
---
It's because some people will buy it. Like, Saudi princes or something.
---
Stop enabling them then. Just take a break from the game for a few months. There's better things to waste time on.
---
Sort of, waiting on wastelanders mainly but I hop on from time to time
---
We need A Christmas event with a Santa Claus robot like from Futurama AND Krampus.
---
Two separate events at the least with legendary bosses who have Unique abilities and attacks.
---
Santa robot can have a 40mm grenade launcher attack built in AND a devastating melee attack AND a Gatling laser AND a Gatling gun AND spouts one liners like liberty prime. 
---
Mobs spawned can be robot elves.
---
Krampus, think sheepsquatch on buffout, psycho, jet and everything in between.
---
Unique AOE attack of radiation damage AND energy damage (has to visibly be charging up for it obviously so players have chance to take cover), devastating melee with Krampus claws (hello new craftable weapon), and if no one wants to gets close quarters also has a devastating acid attack (call it Christmas cheer and he is spreading it...).
---
Mobs are wendigos in Christmas costumes.
---
Have the first occur in the mall.  I forget the name im sorry) and the second in the deep forest or more somewhere...like it was a cult originally.
---
Also, both are always three stars legendaries with a lot damage resistance and are bullet sponges to the extreme.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st
---
They said that mods are coming to private worlds. That doesn't mean only to them but I'm sure that's the case
---
&gt;‚ÄãEdit: Wow Ty guys and ty for the gold award! :D
---
&gt;Edit: OMG! Ty for the NUKA Cola award!!
---
&gt;Edit: Woah! Ty for the 2 silver awards!!
---
...audible groan.
---
Ohhh, yes. I follow. The atom shop IS the live service. Ha! It sounds ridiculous because it's true. :( They won't get a dime from me I can tell you that.
---
Amen to that one! Praise God Howard!
---
I server hopped at Tenagra Town for about half an hour or so farming acid from crickets, I also had about 70 cave cricket meat afterwards
---
Well, not really.
---
We have nothing new on wastelanders and haven‚Äôt for a long time.
---
Family they‚Äôd give more previews it‚Äôd help appease the frustration.
---
As it is a lot of people are skeptical it‚Äôll even happen.
---
Luckily theres a weapon bench about 50 metres from the drop site bunker everyone crowds on
---
Yeah, that can happen. You don't get much from them but a wing scrap, though.
---
Another post said no to it being a display case.
---
I completely agree, I  have done this aswell! It's kinda disappointing to say the least!
---
This has been posted almost verbatim since November 14, 2018.
---
Please keep it up, it's a legitimate concern especially when some of the skins look like they let a 5-year old draw them in M$ paint.
---
The game will run with zero microtransactions. Half the games in my library are online games that have zero microtransactions and no subsccription service and have been actively online for almost ten years. This idea that they need microtransactions and subscriptions to keep servers running is drivel.
---
Winning the game is perceived by how you see advancing in the game not just by gaining an actual advantage over another person with guns or armor.
---
Price anchoring, it's a common marketing technique.
---
Happy cake day
---
Look for the dust (bit like the laser dust pile from disintegrating enemies).   
---
Of course, it's also possible it de-spawned or glitched into the ground.
---
Yep, praise God Howard! Go Fallout 1st, you go now! Because fallout76 is now pay to play!
---
Just checked, both outfits are affected. I don't have an imgur account to provide a picture, sry. Maybe someone else can confirm.
---
It was listed and mentioned.
---
WTF it is my cake day! I didn't even notice. Thanks!
---
They need a bunch of events like meat week to rotate between seasonal events. They should also add some events that are relevant or created from established lore. Maybe a resource based war effort collection.  Canadian annexation day. Maybe some sort of business that has a grand sale event. Where you have to do some sort of scavenger hunt.  Most things found in that time gets a bonus. Put a use to that leader board you created.
---
They dissolve into a pile of ash, no corpse (except one time but I imagine that was a glitch). I assume you didn't find that either. 
---
Yeah you usually get a Mothman wing but it does break down into ballistic fiber. 
---
I have found other items left behind though. From additional ballistic fiber to even necrotic dust(?)  Whatever you use that for.
---
I completely agree. 
---
Amen to that! Praise God Howard! And on behalf of Bethesda thanks for comming out!
---
I was just making a meme, I thought the title made that obvious enough.
---
So, explain?
---
And people keep complaining this game has no new content.
---
That's new to me! I bet nine expected that!
---
Hmm, the idea of being able to spin up a unique VM is way over Bethesda‚Äôs ability to pull off and would no doubt be abused to the max and highly likely cost more on the player end.
---
I mean, ideally every member of 1st SHOULD have their own instance of a VM which can be ‚Äúsnapshotted‚Äù when the players leaves for 20 minutes or longer and then refreshed and passed onto the next player.
---
That way they don‚Äôt need to have dedicated individual VMs for every 1st member.
---
As I said though, the setup and maintenance of this is huge in terms of work and configuration and I don‚Äôt see them having the expertise to pull it off at all.
---
Honestly, I am not quite sure. IIRC I was debating equaltiy between genders when some guy (surprise) went full tilt. The only thing PG13 in his reply was "...you damn twat waffle" and it stuck with me ever since. I like waffles. I love twats.
---
The ta le is not in the ‚Äúdisplay‚Äù section tab in the build menu so i assume it doesn‚Äôt work like in the picture, misleading.
---
I did the event today and intentionally picked up a wet kindling, and still got the Nia ending.
---
My bew favorite saying.
---
I realize that, but Bethesda still decides who works, I guess, more, for lack of a better word.
---
Hey microtransaction team, you work a full week.
---
Bug fix team, take the day off.
---
Not a perfect analogy, but you get what I mean.
---
I feel nostalgic about it. Its what was here when the game launched. OG theme.
---
To this day I still go to bed wondering if it was a canadian stepping over the line, or a brit being polite. Some mysteries will never get solved.
---
Done deal. I'll add you when I'm on next and if you see me around, come find me and I'll have some for you. I think I have about 800ish rounds.
---
Chill out not much to read into I‚Äôve made accounts on a lot of sites that I never use just reserving my gamer tag is all.
---
There's a difference between doing something for money, and doing something ONLY for money.
---
Besides, other dev companies can make compromises and they're not hurting for profit. So what's Bethesda's excuse?
---
Or the dense mod on your chest Armor.  (I think it‚Äôs that mod anyway).
---
This has completely stopped their sonic attacks damaging me now, without any perk points in fireproof...though I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs due more to my unyielding armour and/or a combination of other perks like serendipity and dodgy also triggering.
---
Either way the only things that kill me now is the scorched they spawn or getting caught by their acid attack while I was pre-occupied with said scorched.
---
It will be next months fallout 1st free outfit
---
Lol who this noob asking for MORE? Youl get what you get and thank Todd for it
---
The problem with whitesprings is that you have to go into an interior cell...and the load time is what puts anyone off actually going in there except very rarely
---
Ohhh making a name for yourself I get you my guy. You came to the right game to be a big fish in a little pond haha. Do you have a youtube or twitch?
---
I totally agree. I purchased 1 month of the sub plus I still have atoms I had I did not spend yet. I still have all my atoms I purchased the halloween pack but I already got my atoms back I spent on that basically. I do not even know what to spend my atoms on since most of the stuff is garbage I dont want. So I am just saving them. Maybe a christmas pack will come out i like. For Thanksgiving i plan to buy the display shelf for 300 atoms but not the thanksgiving table and chairs. I never buy many skins or outfits. You can only use one at a time anyway so its not worth owning a whole bunch of skins. People just want everything is the problem.
---
Screenshot everything
---
I don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong with running a business only for the money. 
---
And I don‚Äôt know their excuse. I don‚Äôt work with them. Maybe they‚Äôre just not that good at it. I mean, it‚Äôs gotta be easier to paint some armor than find and fix a bug.
---
Right thats why there should be a fast travel point that drops you inside. Protects you during a nuke as well.
---
But the golf course is on the few areas In the game that has a flat area big enough to build a farm that looks like a farm.
---
I was in other places but people got the same idea and my camp almost never placed.
---
Strangely enough, where my camp is situated on/behind the golf course I‚Äôve only had it not place once or twice compared to almost every time before.
---
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have jack of being on the golf course when people star nuking whitesprings again regularly....
---
Black Friday tactic.  Stores do this.
---
Firsters shouldn't have a build limit.. But at least max it as much as ya can
---
Fucking evil
---
P.S I fixed the issue after reinstalling everything. Just so I don't waste anyone's time.
---
I never buy power armor skins i dont use power armor but 1800 atoms would be all the atoms i have  while i dont do every daily or weekly cuz alota of them require luck or server hopping  the regular ones which i had fun doing are now done which is what i was refering too and i mean cmon thats alotta atoms for 1 skin
---
I spent ¬£12 painting my living room and it's a lot bigger than a suit of power armour
---
I just stopped playing that game was out of control since launch and it‚Äôs still broken as hell
---
Have you tried a grenade ? ( as a temporary thing to rely on )
---
Just a custom image in dev'd environment.  If you could acruallly put stuff on it,that tavle would appear under the display section.
---
Not here though.
---
On their own forums where they can moderate.
---
Here it‚Äôll be way to toxic and they will just get upset and nothing good will happen.
---
The trolling and vitriol here would ruin it quickly AND give the poor mods a stroke.
---
(Valid criticism SHOULD be allowed though but let‚Äôs face it, here three out of every 5 posts at best would be just plain open attacks from people who have never played the game).
---
There is a difference between a disgruntled fan/player and the legion of trolls who are here daily (though it seems to be dying down somewhat now that there are new things to be outraged about on the internet).
---
It should work as a piggy bank for your camp sales. Transaction history &amp; holding up to 30k caps in case you‚Äôre at max. So many little things that can really spruce up this game &amp; make it an amazing place to spend some time. Just wish they‚Äôd follow through
---
I also would like a darker edge to the game.  It's somewhat fluffy.
---
Nope, dont have that.
---
Thinking it was something like that, but I got the hell out of the place I was at because they kept spawning level 68 SMs and I was getting wrecked with no AP lol
---
I don‚Äôt get why the don‚Äôt add outfits people would actually want to pay for.
---
&gt; Maybe just the Devs who patrol on this site could set aside a couple hours to do an AMA one day.
---
There are no "Devs who patrol on this site" (at least in any official way).  The "community managers" are PR people, not "devs".
---
And if there were "devs" they couldn'r reply to your questions, "devs" don't make the decisions.
---
Yep but their rather empty as well except for a test stream I did on youtube once.
---
Only made them in case I actually wanted to pursue that but haven‚Äôt really felt the need.
---
Because people buy it.
---
I completely get what you are saying. The other thing that ticks me off is the amount of time for some of the stuff. Like literally last night I saw the turkey outfit when I logged on and knew I had to have it. I didn't pay attention to the time on it (my fault)...I log in tonight after getting paid and of course, it is nowhere to be found but the higher price stuff sure is. I have been very understanding through bugs and all their issues, but honestly, I am beginning to get sick of paying so much for so little and then dealing with this. Brang back the turkey darn it. It's not even Turkey day and you killed him this early? Bethesda, you need to check your crazy prices and your time limits...the people have spoken.
---
Scorched earth mother fucker!
---
It‚Äôs a good question.
---
I don‚Äôt see it going smoothly at all either given their track record with CAMPs in this game, especially at launch.
---
I just can‚Äôt envision what that would look like.
---
Do you have separate ‚Äúbuilds‚Äù, what I want the same build for both, so I have to do it twice?
---
If I‚Äôm building a complex camp and want to do it on a private server so the chance of me being disturbed is greatly reduced (new player in the area causes the enemies to respawn) BUT have it be my camp on an adventure server how does that work.
---
It‚Äôll probably be as simple as ‚Äúwhat you build on a private server stays there and what you build on a public stays there‚Äù with no option for cross over...which is okay I guess for simplicities sake but not ideal.
---
Why do you people play if you're only going to complain? Pickup another game. Nobody is forcing you.
---
'I personally would want people to have incentive...'. Thats ok if it was your game/creation. As far as im aware youre not an employee of Bethesda. Im sure Beth have their own rules and regs ... oh wait they do. You broke them and got banned. Good. No one asked you to 'help'. Im sure sitting in your 1 bedroom bedsit you think you are making some kind of contribution to a multi-million pound company. You arent. You're a wannabe who hasn't got the talent needed to fix anything. Reading code ain't hard.

...if I need to go use the bathroom and have my character continually walk into a wall for 10 minutes so I don‚Äôt get disconnected then he is always near death when I come back thanks to mutations.

Lesser value than the original 2 skin Liberty Prime offering (which was still pricey).  If you already own those, hard to justify 18 bucks for a grey paint job.  If you don't own the Liberty Prime skins, objectively you are getting a shoddier deal than the original one.
---
&gt; is this just something for the completionist? 
---
Yes.
---
Have you tried scrapping it and building a new one to see if the issue persists?
---
It‚Äôs not a fix but could be a workaround.
---
New plans (working display cases, not the shit we unlocked via plans) in the world for free, along with event/themed atom shop items.
---
If anything ever changed, I hope those who paid the full price get a small refund.
---
Ask for a refund.
---
Agreed.
---
How can I role play as Kellogg with ko goddamn bull Barrel.
---
...or innocent mothers to kill outside of mirelurks queens and the scorchbeast queen.
---
Well, yeah, you can earn Atoms. I stand by that as well. But, the rate at which we can earn Atoms is too slow for the cost of so many items in the Atomic Shop. Prices need to come down, that's all there is to it. Sale prices aren't good enough.
---
There's a level above possum mentioned I think, can't remember where.
---
I don't think that would work easily, the things people do in private servers they would want to bring over to public but I understand that'll happen once mods are integrated anyway
---
Its not even power armor.  Its eighteen dollars for a *skin*.
---
"Innocent"
---
Bro, theyre only innocent if they dont attack first (and those two do)
---
I say kill them all
---
Its on my statements, im gonna contact microsoft and have them remove the charges. I mainly want it fixed so I can get the new handmade skin.
---
I personally think all shotguns are viable, so long as master shotgunner is equipped. I‚Äôll only use skeet shooter along with it if I know I‚Äôm gonna focus using the double barrel. The combat and pump action both murk well without skeet shooter. Double barrel is fine without it too but you need to get up real real close, hence skeet shooter.

For some reason, I think there is an idiot economist making these decisions.  However, there is the flipside.  "We (Bethesda) make no money on MTX's be making things affordable with what can be acquired in-game."  In other words, your achievement atoms will be spent with far more consideration.  Also consider, there has to be an influx of $$$ in order to maintain a multi-player on-line game... so there has to be a target $$$ to get per month, whether it be with MTX's or F1st subscriptions.  They have to make money somehow.  Frankly, I still feel hipped on the Tricentennial Edition I bought thinking it would be something fantastic, and it turns out I barely used the stuff on release.  But that was my choice.  If MTX's were all affordable on what you can my by completing challenges, then Vethesda makes nothing.  But if there is something truly tastey, and a fraction would be willing to pay it, then you might be on to something.    The only thing that bugs me are the repair kitsch.  But that aside... MTX's are where it is at, and that they give in game atoms, the bigger, more tastier items, are gonna run you a little more.  The built in economics have to be that way.  Sorry you didn't get the sweet power armor skin, but in the end, it's a skin.  It forsnt change my game.

They are just defending their children! 
---
Think of the children.
---
...and the best defence is good offence. ;)

That would go about as well as Andrew's BBC interview.
