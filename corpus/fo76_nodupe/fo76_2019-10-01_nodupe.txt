To a degree yes but to talk shit then report me was were it stopped being harmless trolling and started being someone being a miserable little prick
---
---
---
Love 76 and gotten use to the bugs / glitches. Ill never leave.lol
---
the video is really funny u should watch it
---
Looolll. Happy marriedüòÇ
---
Store the piece of roof/flooring that they are sitting on and the turret will appear in your storage tab.
---

---
If they are not on a piece of CAMP that can be stored, the only way to bring them back is to move the camp which stores everything.
---
Same for me on Ash Heap one. Completed it with about 1 min or so to spare......failed event. Wasn't happy
---
Check one of the trading Reddit‚Äôs.  
---
Btw, I picked up all of mine from 250-400 in-game from vendors.
---
It‚Äôs in a quest, the one that wants you to get 7600 hours haha
---
Just reboot it will go poof
---
Its fallout I can play with other people, what more do you need?
---
Whatüò≥
---
You‚Äôll be fine.
---
When they become available, get the perks that allow 130, 160, and 200% repair of PA.  
---
Then it‚Äôll last even longer.
---
Yea you can't, and you're wrong... and a bit snippy with your "herp derp check the internet".
---
Enjoy the company?
---
Handy...no.  Ass-aultron...definitely. üòä  Just enjoy living in the Fallout universe.  Hooking up with "friends" can be cool, but I think I'm addicted to base-building.
---
From what I‚Äôm hearing several ppl are having trouble with the same bunch. Their logic was ‚Äú this is the waste land, get over it and fight back bitch.‚Äù Trying to force PvP during adventure mode. I said that‚Äôs what NW is for and they said ‚Äú that‚Äôs what this whole game is for dick sucker, we‚Äôll make you fight back‚Äù.  Pretty sad.
---
Its never easy. I only started playing 2 1/2 months back but even with me being lvl 93 now i still have issues at times but as we lvl our perks we only grow stronger.
---
Gotcha, I‚Äôll try that. There on my roof so I‚Äôm gonna check it out.
---
I play because of the healthy trading community. Nothing has a trade system like fo76. I hear BL3 has a nice trade interface but dunno how the trade community vibes
---
No PS4
---
Wanna trade? I have a tenderizers. But i dun have mod
---
That‚Äôs probably exactly it. Younger people play on consoles generally while pc gamers (seem to) tend to be more mature
---
Well, up until patch 13, the urban Scout left arm had half the damage resistance as the right arm. The forest Scout arm was always correct.  
---
In other words it's a bug and not enough people have reported it for them to do anything about it yet so I suggest doing so.
---
World spawns like that are based on the person that first enters that "cell" and generates it's contents.
---
The farming trick for that takes two people. The first server hops until they locate a world-item they want, then the second pops-in and grabs it. The first goes back to server hopping to find another. As long as the first does not grab it, that "cell" will generate with the item there for the second to pick up. If they ever do grab it, the world-item will not spawn for them as the first in a cell until their cooldown times out.
---
You and me both. 
---
I‚Äôm L142 with animal friend3, and could not tame a Lvl 1 cat. (Random spawn near vault 76.)
---
Argh.
---
Prime in the Mire is one of the hardest to do, in fact it‚Äôs so frustrating I put a base there with turrets just to try and add a slight edge....
---
  
---
It seems to suffer from:   
---
-some spawn issues.   
---
-delays in registering the end of each wave.   
---
-delays in starting the next wave.   
---
-Spawning the prime creatures near other creatures pathing or spawn points.  
---
    
---
I think it‚Äôs time for a meat weak bug page, I‚Äôll put one up tonight
---
The ones sliding around on their back are a lot of fun haha at least you can vats them.
---
We will see what happens hell there still supose to place in a legendary system in for everyone over lvl 50
---
Lol I just tell myself it's the ghosts of all the ghouls that I have killed at the golf club coming back to seek their revenge!
---
You're good. After patch 13 they were added to the game and the loot pool for the queen.
---
I‚Äôve met plenty of mature people on console
---
The weird weapon I want is a weighs 90% less Shepard's crook just to carry it on me at all times.
---
It's a Fallout prequel, so I'm curious about the story of what was happening in Appalachia before the Great War. But, I love the alternate take on reality that the Fallout series offers, and Ilike the alternate take on reality, with embellishments. 
---
Unlike film and television, the Fallout series, as well as open-world RPG games in general, offer people a way of experiencing worlds that were, might have been, or are yet to come. Over the years, I've come to accept that there are some technical issues with producing a game like Fallout, and while expressing great frustration I continue to be a fan because I want more of the story, or maybe it's just the weird romanticization of being totally dependent on yourself in a world of other people and things that want to kill you. 
---
Fallout 76 is a different animal so far. While you've got the lore and an emerging story of what was happening in Appalachia in the years leading up to the Great War, you've also got real people and the unpredictability that an real person brings with them who have their own interpretations of what Fallout means for them and what ethical standards which they have ascribed to the Fallout Universe.
---
I don't think age really factors into it tho, I've played with many young children and teenagers and they were all pleasant. Maybe a bit chatty or full of questions, but good experiences nonetheless. Any one can be a dick head. Guarantee the 2 that griefed me were middle aged men getting there jollies off being assholes
---
‚ÄúYou will emerge!‚Äù, I understand that, but I‚Äôd like a wine cellar in the basement
---
I got it, it's basically a salute but without the emote icon that plays over your head or a sound
---
Post it yourself then..ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
First off, there are no hacked plans. If at all they are duplicated/duped.
---
Secondly no one would bother to dupe plans, the gain is way too low.
---
Thirdly, even if yours was duped, once you learned it the item no longer exists, which should make you save.
---
Of course that isn‚Äôt to say they‚Äôre not. I‚Äôm on PS4 and have had lots of great experiences. Just seems to be the case I have seen a number of griefers too
---
Needy and clingy much?
---
It's stupid because fallout 76 is just a game
---
They doesnt render you completely invisible.  That would be completely game breaking for NW.
---
I call 'em Beth too! Usually when I'm mad at' em though! lol
---
I recommend learning the stair stacking glitch well - its a pain in the ass to deconstruct and doesn't blueprint -and you also have to plan a bit - but you can save tons on budget with how much it contributes to structure and saves space. It also allows you to embrace vertical builds in a way you can't get out of the standard stairs. I've used it a ton for interesting cliff face or bridge builds.  
---
See this video for howto:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfb-QT4gp-I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfb-QT4gp-I)  (though the build itself is kind of a basic step up from floating towers)
---
first place the point.. then you can pick any card you have available 
---
you do not have to place the point and pick the card in the same stat.. but you always place the point first
---
Ever heard of roleplaying?
---
Get ready for your nocturnal +1 charisma sweet spot wood left leg!
---
I seen 1 greafer on xbox one at meat week with a bloody build everyone was in passive so they couldent hurt anyone then one lvl 233 got out of passive for a second and slaughtered them fast with a 2 shot explosive shotgun.
---
Also +100 carry weight if you wear the set. +200 if you also add calibrated shocks mods to the legs!
---
I don‚Äôt watch you tubers. I am afraid of potential vault dwellers being turned away though
---
I have the game on both PC and PS4. I play without voice chat on both platforms, so I can only judge people by how they act, not based on their age (as guessed by how they sound). From my interactions, niceness and assholeness levels are about the same. The *huge* thing is, number of NW cheaters on PC is about 6000, while on PS4 it's 0.
---
Same. We would've made it last time if the Behemoth wasn't a legendary.
---
Scorch beasts are weak just use a bloodied explosive railway rifle and take each one down in four shots
---
I sell all ammo no matter what type it is for 1 cap per.
---
I'm honestly fine with the the pictures now that they made the camera more easily obtainable. But when you need vaulted atomic shop clothing for these dailies is when I draw the line... mainly because i cant progress any further lol
---
Bravo sir bravo!
---
Are those buttons or nipples? Sorry, it‚Äôs oddly eye catching.

I'm currently having the same issue on pc.

Were you talking on mics? You sure it was a girl?
---
My first nuke, a level 189 just stole it from me and nuked my camp, you‚Äôre very right.
---
I shall never rest again until I get to sleep in your bed, while level 5 mirelurks destroy your crops.
---
Finally! I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one...
---
I think, I mean at least I know it‚Äôs not just me doing something wrong. I‚Äôve made tons of serums, and now all of a sudden it just doesn‚Äôt work :(
---
Dumping on Youtubers is guaranteed karma increase for redditers in this circlejerk known as fo76 sub.
---
Nope. People rarely buy. I am not at an appealing spot.
---
Nope, didn‚Äôt even think about that actually, ha
---
Nope, no mic. Doesn't really matter if it was a girl or a boy, really, only the character matters here.
---
Ya lvl 50+ is kinda need be for anything to do with the dmv or that end of the capital as everything is scaled to lvl 30+ last i went in there every enemy was lvl 60
---
Ugh. That‚Äôs so painful.
---
Shotguns are okay, but Two-shot is terrible on a shotgun as the accuracy is dreadful. Get an AAE, IE in stead if you can.
---
Congrats on making the big time! 
---
3000 pumpkins!? I haven‚Äôt bought pumpkins before but assuming $1 each if lucky, thats $3000 minimum for a cool project like this. üò≥
---
Where did ‚ÄúToon‚Äù come from? I asked some guy raging on another post and he just got mad. You and him are the only two I‚Äôve ever saw call it that. Is this like... a thing?
---
Damn that's nice. I once got a bloodied explosive double barrel and then about a week after that a bloodied explosive railway rifle! I literally yelled from happiness when I saw the railway rifle!
---
They‚Äôre all in my stash, for sure, I throw them in there immediately so no one takes it when I drop my junk
---
I had that same issue a few days ago when taking on the queen with my tesla rifle
---
Btw you should go for 3* armor because it is worth a lot more than weapons
---
Engage with other players. Trading, talking or what ever.
---
It's me, with my high agility Stealth Batman character. You better walk the path of the righteous.
---
What platform?
---
Im not sure about TSE, but Vats crit is great.
---
I was coming back from building a lowbies camp lol. What was my crime üò¢
---
Thanks
---
That's awesome lol I run vanguard so I script anything BE. I also got a furious explosive assaultron head with 90% weight. Is that rare?
---
I give most of it away...
---
The clean blue suit. I want to roleplay Rude and Reno.
---
Buttons haha, I see what you mean though.
---
Well you are obviously wrong, look at how many red power helmet editions Gamestop sold. An amazing 32 out 20,000!
---
Because I once for a bolstering sentinel metal chest, traded that with 4k 5.56 for a BE less vats tesla and then traded that for a vampires explosive handmade and an anti armor explosive railway rifle
---
Best communities ever? Try Uranium Fever and see how helpful everyone is.
---
Ye its legacy so it doesn't drop anymore it goes for a lot. Btw can you give me the be weapons if you don't want them if you on ps4?
---
[deleted]
---
The game really is just that much better when you play with at least one other person. My husband and I play the game together and it's a great it's a blast.
---
fax. lvl 76, i only sell bullets for 69 caps each. üò§
---
Obvious a user who was really into Fallout as no one would use the word chems in their IGN, even then I recommend removal of this comment as its considered Witch Hunting and may land you in a bit of trouble, personally I hate Raiders and would prefer Fallout 76 version where we all hold hands and help each other(I seriously want this) but this game was meant for us to play as any faction including stealing silos like a Raider.
---
This is so touching, ya'll made me tear up! Thank you for sharing your wonderful journey!
---
Bless you both ‚ù§
---
Do they kill werewolves? Lol
---
Players buy from me all the time.
---
I have the same thing happen with pretty much any gun I have equipped at the time. I have to actually open the Pip-Boy and unequip then re-equip the gun.
---
Do scorchbeasts eat Deathclaws?
---
I'm not saying they dont or that you shouldn't charge what you want to. I'm just saying it's a cheesy thing to do lol.
---
Im waring all legendary gear from items i pickup from legendaries
---
Shotgun is great. Honestly though, two shot makes it a mess. My TSE combat shotgun has been in storage for ages. The "inaccuracy" effect that two shot gives makes the spread ridiculous. Anti armor, explosive, executioners, etc etc, all end up feeling better than two shot.
---
You're mean
---
Thank you! I understand that we want to keep putting pressure on Bethesda to improve the game even more, but I am still having alot of fun 2 months into my playtime with it. Now granted Bethesda needs to get a handle on the bug situation and 76 could use more end game content, but other then that it was a $30 well spent.
---
It would make sense, but... Well... I still remember those days when eyeglasses improved perception.
---
I'm not sure lol. I thought thier diet consisted of level 10s and the occasional sloth.
---
Let me swim in your trunkets and treasures
---
When people get close to maxing out their cap limit they're forced to spend and they'll buy even overpriced things as long as its something they actually need.
---
Old enough...to party
---
Fair point. What triggered me wasn't the deliberate trolling tho it was the messaging me talking shit and when I respond, reporting me. Such a cuck move.
---
sure i can probably fit you in my pocket as well
---
exactly, comrade.
---
I have done it five times. I would do it again if the limit of characters wasnt five. The first 20 levels are brutal, fun, √≠tems matter, legendaries are scarcer...
---
You are awesome! Thank you so much!
---
A good number of players on 76 are from ESO so there use to getting there asking price. Eso atleast has price value lists on what things are worth but 76 dont have the feature yet. So players are left to makeup there own price tags.
---
Congrats man I am glad that you guys are together and share the love for the same thing it‚Äôs nice to see this in a world of nothing but bad news I am also I fallout fan been one since I was born basically and I am glad that you two love the game as much as you love yourselves Anyways congratulations from New England (Connecticut I wish Massachusetts then I would have an excuse to wear a giant vault boy head) anyways congrats have a good one and also cheers üçªüéäüéâüéäüéâ
---
I think the personal terminal will list all daily quests that you've completed before and is able to mark it on the map for you.
---
I'm jealous of your life, cool stuff!
---
U wont be able to do end game gear till lvl 50 then the real hunt starts for balistic fiber.
---
I won‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why I reported them. I‚Äôm not homosexual, married but I have zero tolerance for griefers. And actually the community isn‚Äôt that bad, you get a spoiled egg every now and then. I‚Äôm going to start recording any griefing taking place. It‚Äôs my biggest dislike in gaming.
---
Very true. But after a while it‚Äôs like what the point?
---
As buggy as 76 is me and my wife always manage to have a blast playing. Congrats man, nothing better than being married to someone who shares the same passion for something that you do. I'm going on just over 11 years(married for 4) with my wife. Her epilepsy sometimes makes is difficult for her to enjoy games but we still find a way! Again, congratulations!
---
I'm saying they're getting their info from reddit?
---
Also when the hell did I ever say that? Or did you infer something? I'm confused :|.
---
The base bar.
---
i cant think of a single good reason why not
---
Just ignore it. I think it might be a little...challenged.
---
Griefers are gonna grief, regardless of platform, especially with Survival coming to an end.
---
My general response is to strip down to my underpants and cycle the finger pistol dance until one of us gets bored.
---
Yeah I can see that and its understandable.
---
Nice! I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen a complete set before
---
I'm surprised Juice bothered to get it correct in his video.  He seems to have a major hate boner for 76.  I swear he only still plays because his hate gets him clicks.  Loved him when he covered Fallout 4 and the mod scene but I don't watch him much anymore because all he does is shit talk the game and BGS.
---
Well being fair .. ALL of the old videos are still up and will stay up until either the creator takes them down or youtube closes. these videos also pop up first a lot of the time during the searches for 76 ‚Ä¶ Skillups comes to mind as one of the first results.
---
There are still a TON of videos on youtubes of people enjoying the game. Build guides and even videos enticing new players to join. But I do get where you're coming from .. all I can say is; it's a online game ‚Ä¶ just try to get as much out of it now while you can cause online games do not last forever like single player games.
---
The drums don't make progress on their own, they slow down the loss of progress. If you have 3 on drums and 3 on spits the bar more or less doesn't move over time, but when nobody is on those it goes down fast enough that it is hard to make progress.

you have picked up some tick blood correct?
---
That's a silly comment. Of course you can beat them, but a hard to find weapon plus a suitable build are not the answer to some random encounter.
---
Three of us complete it all the time full and none of us get in the drums. We always finish with minutes left to spare. The only time we fail is when someone sits on drums without helping gather. Just my observation over this week. Not saying you're wrong just saying the drum isn't necessary for us to win. My group has finished dozens of times
---
Got bored.  I‚Äôll be back for wastelanders
---
So killing players does not make you wanted anymore? I play in passive mode as I'm not interested in PvP so obviously I don't know the game I'm criticizing.
---
Playing as Raider. What I mean that any PvP is (to me) playing as Raider in Fallout.
---
Yes, the wastelanders and NPC's were not meant to be in the game. Only after the huge out cry about NPC's did they start planning on adding them.
---
Just watch or read any interviews before the launch.
---
well in the case of the gatlin plasma it's gonna be the explosive because that gun doesn't normally shoot "bullets" like it does with the explosive version a normal one shoots nothing like that
---
Congrats! Are you on PC? Your toon looks incredibly familiar.
---
The healing bug Is ruining it for me. Hard to play, waste lots of ammo... Confusing...
---
Instigating pump shotgun was my favourite weapon, realistic and fun.
---
The problem with melee is that hit detection bug... Ghost hits are a bitch.
---
Most enemies interrupt your loading of the two barrel. Annoying as fuck.
---
If you ever get near the "Collision Course" event at the airport, whatever boxes are there will follow you home. And to the train station. And randomly block your path as you rush to revive a teammate. Think it it as Bethesda's version of Tails, but more prone to blocking things.
---
Not sure if you can even harm a event group member.
---
If survival was so popular why were there only 1-2 servers at any given time and why did the vault raids go to these empty servers and work without much lag.
---
Id vote to get rid of them. Damn things lock up your game when more then one is going off. Often the audio gos bannanas and i have to pull out my ear buds. Crazy loud
---
As a needy clingy?
---
Wow wasn‚Äôt here for that
---
Why not? It's just for fun.
---
Yeah not sure why I need to be naked to get in it lol
---
Good ppints. I play enough that I'm able to frequently sell excess legendaries in my player vending machine. With these extra caps I'm able to by lots of ammo at other player's camps. I'm too impatient to craft all the ammo I need.
---
it's not a bug, npcs can now dodge melee attacks
---
The hell would you post this in someone elses post?  Just make your own post and link to pics of your hole.
---
I see berserker as Hard mode. My hooded rags are badass...
---
Yeah I‚Äôm trying to find a legendary vanguard set right now, i have all the perk cards i need for my build as well, just leveling those cards up and seeing whatever loot i can get
---
anything to back that? Or just that it ‚Äúshoots normal bullets‚Äù? 
---
I‚Äôm just curious, cos I‚Äôve seen a lot about FFR doing better DPS than Explosive, but hadn‚Äôt seen anything regarding the Gatling Plasma.
---
Either that or when you get the chemistry station. Was thinking about running blood sucker for a bit lol.
---
ok
---
Are you on PC? I have extras of different ones.
---
No, but does it mean your opinions must be made into game? No to that also.
---
From thousands of suggestions and ideas from this reddot community alone, how many have made it to the game? Not a lot. 
---
They have Limited resources to work with and honestly Fallout 76 is more AA-game than AAA-game.
---
True, but Skyrim will always be there for me!
---
I have two Bloodied characters that run a stealth commando / rifle build. My B FFR handmade kills way faster than my BE handmade. With energy weapons, explosive seems to do unintended extra damage, from what I‚Äôve seen in videos.
---
I'm not sure.  I don't bother with it with a standard 20-clip penetrating clip that's bumped up to 80.  I'm going for less weight, but maximum efficiency.
---
Happens.. To a lot of people. It's not very clear after you've been fliping thru cards to check out you're options.
---
If you're unsure just back out once you have decided and do it from the start.
---
I don't see where they prices it under 1 cap per round.  How do you even do that?
---
INCEL ALERT 
---
Dude this is just sad
---
That hasn't been my experience. Bloodied benefits constantly from serendipity and high agility buffs... My unarmed bloodied hardly ever dies.
---
How can you be a Fallout player and not understand the concept of roleplaying? This post was written by "my character", not me.
---
So cool!!!
---
that's witchhunting and literally against the rules of this sub
---
Add one for the Bog meat event:  Behemoth left the area at high speed. A couple of us caught him at Flooded Trainyard. Weirdest thing I've ever seen. (Xbox)
---
Location could be your issue or maybe you aren‚Äôt selling stuff that is in demand?
---
The bane to my existence this. I just wanna vendor hop and look for a nice laser. 
---
Damn trolls.
---
yes it does, maybe read the rules...
---
I posted something similar last week and got a lot of heat from folks who said it would be OP to do so. I mean, I like the idea, but I get their point.
---
I try to sell ammo, but usually it sits in the vendor forever. I don't want to carry it around either, but I also don't want it taking up space in my stash. I've probably thrown away more ammo than I will ever sell.
---
I leave venders if I see high ammo cost. Won't even look in your other vending units.
---
It depends on your alternatives. It‚Äôs going to suck if you get mobbed because of that damn reload.
---
Last Friday, I had the Behemoth run off at high speed. A couple of us finally caught up with him at the Flooded Trainyard. Needless to say, we failed that one.
---
can someone confirm?
---
griefers suck, but don't feed them, they are reading this post laughing their asses off.  this is exactly the reaction they want.  also why didn't you have your best gear?  would you not always be running with it?
---
My 25k Snallygaster Spit Attack Explosion and Dog Helmet in vendor have sentimental value.
---
The vast majority of Youtubers are shit.  Bunch of pandering, bandwagoning bullshit artists catering to the most toxic individuals.  There's a reason they say "Don't read the Youtube comments".
---
I‚Äôm not sure why it would be OP with the backpack in the game it takes away a big reason to have PA and armor pieces having multiple legendary effects I feel like it‚Äôs OP for it to put it underneath regular armor imo
---
My thoughts exactly! üòçü§©üòòü§îü§§üò™üò©üò†      üòÜ
---
I have a full display case of perfectly preserved pies, AND one in the vendor AND one in the stash. I don't know whats happening. I went for ages without getting one pie, and then they've just been flying out of the machine one after another! 
---
Maybe it's to make up for the 1\* Bloodied Shovel a 3\* Mirelurk Queen dropped.
---
you asked if he was on PS4. he said xbox.
---
You listen to the hit, damage is shown on screen, but the enemy does not lose health. That's a bug, darling. And a famous one.
---
My bad
---
Like I said, I like the idea. But the criticism centered on using armor with legendary effects added on top of PA benefits. 
---
My reasoning was if everyone has access to wearing armor under their PA, then no one has an advantage. I deleted the original post because it seemed so unpopular at the time.
---
Um....there is no laser muskets in fallout 76.....
---
A real tear jerker. *sniff. Sorry, brother. Have some buffout to ease the pain.
---
[removed]
---
I've had super mutants swing AR's at me like they were super sledges
---
Up until a few weeks ago sure. Now they fixed the damage and death happens frequently.
---
I gotcha. I understand not being able to wear armor while in PA but I feel like I should be able to wear my shielded Knight suit.
---
the random damage is you running through thorns
---
Agreed!!
---
those ones are fucking nightmare fuel!  first time I saw one I was genuinely creeped out
---
I'll take that, thank you so much. May the Mothman be with you.
---
on paper explosive will always out-dps ffr. the problem is that the damage bug still exists but seems to affect explosive weapons only. on top of that, SBs are oddly resistant to explosions, unless you shoot at the ground. which to me indicates it's unintended.
---
explosive laser pistols/rifles are different in that the splitter essentially turns them into shotguns pre-nerf. with the firerate of a .50 cal at that. or at least that's the status quo, in my testing the displayed damaged seemed to match.
---
bug or not, the idea is that you're showering mobs in explosions. with any other weapon, explosive and ffr versions are evenly matched. but with laser rifles and GPs the difference is quite noticeable.
---
even so, after using them extensively, I have to say a primed LMG doesn't fall far behind. its dps against the queen might even be higher, save for the constant reloading.
---
Get two tick bloods and one antiseptic.  You should be able to craft a blood pack at a chemistry station. There is no plan or recipe to find beforehand. 
---
If you have it you should equip the chemist perk and the super duper perk to increase the amount that are crafted.
---
Thanks! We appreciate it!
---
Do you have any extra yellow for sale?
---
I have one vendor with just plans. Either I sell no plans for days and days, or somehow every player who has never seen a bunch of plans comes to my camp one after another. 
---
My plans are roughly 10-50% of the recommended price, and I've ditched stuff under 100 (except some less common recipes). Still they just sit there.
---
‚ÄúWhat can your creepy uncle Lester do for you this time?‚Äù
---
Dont die
---
I think there random and I don‚Äôt think you can kill one anymore. I killed one months ago and since then whenever I see one. It vanishes after two or three shots.
---
Fallout 76
---
I never thought of that!
---
Thanks for sharing your story about you &amp; your wife. I think what makes it tick well is we have things we really enjoy together, but we also allow ourselves to do what we love best that we don't share.
---
The mire
---
Shh I just have something in my eye I definitely don't wish someone would do this for me
---
Grab a random event spawn map, pick an area with a good concentration of them and start walking/running between them. Start at 6pm in game time and search until 3am. Don't fast travel, walk/run. The next night, pick another area and do it again.

Find ghouls

They haven‚Äôt been invented yet

Bruh but i neeed it for atom challenges üò†üò†üò†

Laser musket is a weapon from the developer room, which makes carrying one very risky and could very likely cause you a ban. I have never seen a player have it in my playthrough.
---
I'm on PC and so far I seem to be averaging about one a month.
---
Wow thanks
---
In the dev room there are
---
Double thanks
---
Ok this one is helpful
---
Thanks I try
---
I do it *in* liberty prime PA
---
Dude this is terrifying Hahahaha stop it YOU wrote it. This is reddit not fallout bro. Go role play on the game
---
Drink water from a lake with no power armor or protection
---
There‚Äôs always a Super Mutant with a mini gun and ammo behind WestTek‚Äîand most places they spawn.
---
Drop perk points into weapon and ammo reductions since you can‚Äôt use armor traits!
---
I‚Äôm sure you knew this, but just reminding ü§ó
---
Well, it's the game's subreddit, so...
---
I killed one a week ago just SW  of Camp Venture. 
---
Listen for a weird humming and a purple glow. Sneak up on it rage a picture then kill it as fast as possible.
---
Anybody can be nice (or pretend to be nice) when there‚Äôs nothing serious on the line to lose, and a resource is abundant. ‚ÄúOh, a stranger gave me stimpacks and a modest legendary!‚Äù Who cares?
---
The moment it‚Äôs something of significant relative value, watch everyone fuck each other over. That‚Äôs where the character test is. And most people fail.
---
Well done!
---
I play with my 3 sons but it's flipped. I've played since launch and they waited until about a month ago so I'm lvl 215 and they are lvl 50ish. Just like irl. always asking me for caps and food. 
---
 I knew they would come around like everyone else and start playing so I took the advantage and started grinding all I could so they can never beat Dad now! ;)
---
The forest
---
there's no pre-nerf TSEs btw. they've all been nerfed the same. but you can still get legacies if you got the right trades.
---
when i seen this 2 patches ago i thought for sure they were gonna add a whole communist ATOM store bundle and then nothing happened.
---
Yes they save but you can't put them back into the gallery to be used as load screens.
---
I've heard nuke silos were decent but I haven't gotten around to check them out myself.
---
 Edited to add more locations based on other responses. 
---
There's a minigun in the locked cage/room at Camp ~~Defiance~~ *Venture*.
---
There's a minigun atop Poseidon Power plant. 
---
There's a 50 caliber machine gun in the bed of a pickup truck that is near a crashed vertibird in the Toxic Valley.  It's not too far from Hemlock Holes.  
---
Ammo:
---
Pick up all the cups and pizza/hot dog trays at Camden Yard and Tyler park.  These break down to cloth.  Pre-war money is great for cloth, too.  The collision course event will give about 100 pre-war money. 
---
For acid (to create gunpowder and/or smelt ore) there are workshops with acid nodes, there are the crickets at Tonagra Town, and the snallygasters at Toxic Larry's and Pylon V-13. Just server hop to kill them again. 
---
Lead ore: Lucky hole mine and the Excavator Power Armor. 
---
Steel: Big Bend tunnel including the entrance and exit areas).  Collect all the junk, weapons, and armor and use the scrapper perk when scrapping weapons and armor. There are workbenches at both sides of the tunnel, and a few inside nearer to the eastern entrance. 
---
You can always visit vendors for buying guns and ammo, too.
---
They must be everywhere then, even south in the ashy wastes lol. Oh and in water üòÇ
---
Excel spreadsheet.
---
It doesn‚Äôt take hardly any time at all to do. Just type in player names with notes (specifics of nice selection, or a delusional idiot with prices, etc) and it very rapidly fills up. You‚Äôd be surprised how fast, and how often you start to see the same names.
---
There are morons blacklisted I know to never go to again, after a three-second search. It makes unknown players weirdly exciting.
---
I‚Äôm on console. I just use my laptop.
---
I would say Morgantown Airport.
---
Ok. So save my fav load screens for gallery?
---
Some smart cookie who act knows real value needs to create a app like eso has that will mark the current value on items.
---
They‚Äôre killable. Killed one with my three-person team less than a month ago. It disappears, but reappeared close by. Kept attacking one of the team, who spammed stimpacks until we all got there. Good weapon helped a lot (Level 45 Handmade with Powerful Auto Receiver and multiple Commando perks).
---
I mean, I don‚Äôt get it either. Just stopped at someone‚Äôs CAMP and seen them selling the sack with hoses headset for like 2000 caps. Looked it up where to find it (Sutton Station), went there to see how much it cost in the vendor. With the bargain perk card levels up to three stars....10 caps. I mean whatever floats your boat but I‚Äôll never understand why people do that.
---
That would be awesome.
---
They may be there, but they aren't in the game so if you see a laser musket in the game, congrats, you've ran into a cheater.
---
It would be vicious for a stealth first strike then quick select a secondary weapon.  Then open up a good book or get some achieves done during the reload.
---
Yes and what is needed. Eso has thease verry apps that are alwase kept up to date.
---
I have had a couple run-ins with players trying to force pvp. I have pacifist mode enabled, so when they come at me with that noise I just thumbs up and walk away unscathed.
---
Comes and goes. I remember one of my first times doing it there were 2 other guys in there, and both stopped and let me get shots in on all the legendaries. (In fact, once it was obvious I didn't know what I was doing they kinda led me around to where the spawns were going to be so I was prepared.)
---
Not saying everyone's a prince, but my experience has been that there's more good than bad seeds in this game. (On PC, at least.)
---
Agreed
---
Walk. Avoid fast travel for a couple of hours and be lucky. I see him maybe once a week because I don't fast travel with three of my five characters.
---
They are in the game. People took them from the dev room
---
You can get it by harvesting swamp blossoms from just outside dryer chemical. However they only spawn when the Heart of the Swamp event is active. Even then, they don‚Äôt always spawn. If they do spawn, they are easy to find since the flowers glow green like a small firefly.
---
Which ones do you need still?
---
Most of what I mentioned appears either on corpses or in display cases at The Whitespring lol
---
On PC only. They are not in the game on ps4 or xbox  1. So congrats, you've ran into players who have weapons never meant to be in the game.
---
mAyBe ReAd ThE rUlES jeez I thought I was the butt hurt one üòÇ
---
Because of the foliage in that particular area, the scorchbeasts receive concealment from attacks which doesn‚Äôt effect their ranged attacks.  Even with my less than optimal build, I can kill an 80th level Scorchbeast on the ground in maybe 7 to 10 seconds with a ranged weapon.  But their flight kills my hit placement and I get range penalties to damage.  And also being spammed by their sonic screams while be meleed doesn‚Äôt help.
---
The m the same way. Normally I‚Äôm in a group so don‚Äôt hear what‚Äôs being said but I was a lone wonderer today and had been talking to a guy about trades. That‚Äôs when it started. Time to start holding some accountable for their actions when it comes to stuff like that.
---
leader of the pack
---
You‚Äôre A Free Stater, figure it out yourself! Hahaha
---
Is everything alright at home??
---
You‚Äôre just askin all the questions tonight eh?!
---
Yeah üòÅ
---
There is a mini gun on top of the power plant in grffton
---
Ask reddit.
---
Can‚Äôt do it on Reddit..
---
I keep forgetting about the one atop Poseidon power plant.
---
All you need is a laser musket you can one shot Scorch beasts with it
---
I played Ark for years and loved the economy on that game. Tbh the economy on this game is what keeps me around too. I enjoy buying stuff cheap and flipping it for a profit, give me something to do with the cap limit since I'm too lazy to transfer to my mule
---
Whoopsies, swamp itch, and needle spine
---
Did you switch weapons or something? Just speculating, but maybe you need to do a certain amount of DPS to aggro them. I killed 2 recently, but could never do it when I had less powerful weapons/build.
---
I seen one in the forest next to my home in the tick filled logging yard near moonshiners shack.
---
Three days ago... And I do not wear unyielding.
---
Yeah maybe that‚Äôs it.
---
Im sorry sir yes sir
---
Ya alot do
---
And maybe a water version the giant turtle?
---
I decided the best way to make 76 fun again is to have goals. So i chose some. Now I'm making others make them easy. Im a complicated character.
---
All u need to do is climb the stair case and wack low lvl scorch to get to it .. childs play.
---
It's the one with the gray blanket, right?

Now honeymoon stay at the Greenbrier.

Thanks bruther. Just made my excavator tonight. Will be using all this.
---
Agreed!
---
bruh so many question posts by u in a row i thought i was on ur profile xd
---
"They'll have the best loot."
---
Lmao. I decide the way to make 76 fun again is to set goals so im asking the questions I need to kick start them.
---
A couple of friends walked through the western boundary of the map just south of Point Pleasant last week. The weird thing is, only the two female characters could glitch through; several male characters were blocked by the invisible wall. Apparently Ohio is a NO DUDES zone!
---
I have a deathclaw meat that I can't cook, eat or drop
---
This is absolutely wonderful (for both yourselves and Bethesda)!!!!!!   
---
I will say though, I chuckled when I read "sprung for canvas" lol.
---
This
---
Play for 500 hours and pray you get lucky lol
---
I've walked out of Lucky Hole with around 200 lead ore. That yields 500+ lead scrap. 
---
If you are meticulous at Big Bend it's easy to get many hundreds of steel scrap.
---
Bruh did you not even watch the video, there are maybe 2 or 3 laser muskets in the entire game
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Agree. They do glitched damage with splitter. It about doubles the damage. Same thing applies to explosive harpoon with flechette. 
---
Majority of legacy energy weapons have never dropped, they have been created by duping.
---
They fixed the explosive shotgun damage not to do much more than intended damage. Though it nerfed them quite hard low due low pellet damage.
---
I think the fuck not, besides they aren't even that hard to get just get like 20-30k caps and you're good
---
Scrip
---
I tried to make my camp a little like the disney castle/old gothic architecture. Ive toyed about making up a new theme. I hate to tear it down tho. I think it would be interesting to see two players make a giant camp, half each. Wish camp budget was bigger

Sounds pretty awesome, is there a suggestion you think I should attempt then?

Cookout is fine.. Servers taking a poop.

It was me. I had a blast!
---
Congrats! Now get that Lover's Embrace Perk !
---
My son and I play together. He‚Äôs 19 now and it gives us adult father and son time together. We don‚Äôt live together anymore so it gives us a great way to bond and keep up with each other. I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything. I‚Äôve raised him a gamer because I‚Äôve played since the first Nintendo and he as a boy brought home fallout 3, ever since then we‚Äôve been hooked on the FO series as well as ES. We love it and I know what you mean when you say you get excited together over a new release. To some it may seem mushy but to us it‚Äôs a passion we share. He‚Äôs turned out to be a great young man as well. Kudos to Bethesda for give fathers and sons a excellent way to bond.
---
Minigun inside posidion in a closet with a lvl1 lock. Kinda hard to describe but it's down the hall from the main room where you turn on the station. Its a lvl 25.
---
EDIT: there is a .50 cal gun right near the crashed vertibird south of hemlock holes. In a jeep also lvl 25
---
Explosive with splitter is significantly higher damage. With explosive bullet does full explosive damage. Say weapon with 80 base damage. Explosive damage is 20% of said 80. Add splitter. Each extra explosive "bullet" does same amount of explosive damage as without splitter. It should be divided how much many hits the splitter does.
---
the strongest enemy would be the radroach
---
Say a few prayers maybe. Ran into the *corpse* of one out in the Mire a couple of days ago, there was a player fighting a Scorchbeast who must have killed it before I got close.
---
considering someone else suggested searching near Camp Venture, the Mire might be a good start. Mostly just gotta be lucky, though.
---
It's actually closer to $4 per pumpkin, but I'm assuming most of them are donated or the homeowner has a deal with a local farm since those details weren't in the story.
---
Can't upvote this enough, stabilized plus one gun army are awesome counterparts for that build. I also maxed demolition expert because auto grenade launchers are super fun.
---
Keep being awesome!
---
I got whoopsies from a diseased mirelurk spawn and swamp itch from a sleeping in a random sleeping bag.
---
You to buddy. Maybe one day if your on PS4 we can father and son team. Might be pretty cool.
---
Haunted house for halloween, maybe a maze with traps.
---
Agreed, would rather see these just gone cause then the market would be hell of a lot better than it is now
---
Uh, dude. It was a mannequin. 
---
We were all watching you...
---
Haha, unfortunately we're on PC but that would be awesome!
---
I haven't played in a few weeks, what did I miss?
---
Just got mine straight for BG and all in need now is a TSE Gatling gun.
---
I think you‚Äôre talking about Strangler raid power armor, not legacies.
---
On it
---
I would say worth it, buy it now get used to the game and level up for the upcoming massive update
---
It is probably like many things, you need to loot one first then you can craft it.
---
N-no, it can't be! It-- I mean she is real! I touched her with my own third arm!
---
ive definitely enjoyed it but here soon hopefully before the year is over they are gonna be adding a shit ton of new stuff like npcs and factions and other things that are gonna greatly change how things go
---
My dad says I have so much games already that he gets pissed when I buy a new game. So I had to sneak them into the house and say "Hey, It's a gamepass game"
---
My camp pipe dream is to make a game show studio. Maybe even recreate the price is right if it's possible. But just make a bunch of cool games and stuff around camp and dish out caps rewards and even A BRAND NEW POWER ARMORRR
---
How are they going to remove weapons that lots of people earned or traded for?  That would cause a ton of hardcore and long-time players to quit the game.  I‚Äôm sure that would help the long term prospects of this game. üôÑ
---
Like others have said, trade for one if you need one.  Otherwise, just get good normal weapons.  It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre gimped if you have an IE Lever, AAE Handmade, or B/FFR Minigun. With any of those,you dominate the game.
---
I just want a black cloak or tux.
---
Are you buying it on PC?
---
Only reason I ask is because I've found used copies for console around 20-25. Wal-Mart seems to be offering a PC copy (physical, but it's literally just a printed code) for 30.
---
In any event, 30 is worth it, 40 might be pushing it. Especially given that I'm sure it will go on a deeper discount as the holidays arrive.
---
2* ranged weapons is your best bet to find big cap items.  Waiting until you‚Äôre level 50+, and you might want to save up for the purveyor sale that‚Äôs in about three weeks.
---
Both could be it.
---
I‚Äôm not the only one who‚Äôs a bank for their kids...
---
Yes but just don‚Äôt leave game from there...
---
Workshops never save.
---
After a person leaves the server whatever they built will stick around for a short period of time.  So you can sometimes find unclaimed workshops with existing structures/defense already built.
---
i heard that u have to spend those points when u level up below 50 otherwise they game does not count u as the new level until u spend the points, but over level 50 it does not matter u have unlocked all perks after 50 anyway
---
And your point would be?
---
2* is a better value than a 3*. You can get twice as many 2*, and a B25 Handmade and a B25 90 Handmade aren‚Äôt way different in value.  The first two modifiers are the important ones. You‚Äôre best value is to buy 2* ranged weapons only.  Find armor on player vendors. You could do 2* melee weapons, but there‚Äôs a much smaller market if you want to resell them versus ranged weapons.
---
Cheaters have flooded the market. Idk why you're getting on this guys case about this weapon.
---
I thought I lucked out with a two shot combat model. 0 accuracy really sucks.
---
I'm not getting on his case? Are you okay sir?
---
Known bug.
---
TS is a bad prefix.  The Dragon is a novelty weapon. So, it‚Äôs not a high demand weapon. If you want a Dragon, I‚Äôd want Instigating or Bloodied.
---
Can you not remember what you just typed? Look at this string.
---
I've got a vampire pump action and I love it. Plus for queen fights I can switch to heavy weapons easily. 
---
I'd love a VE pump action with reduced weight, but I've never seen one for sale.
---
I normally run about 10% health, and actually use inert flux as water lol
---
He finds you.
---
Never seen one either. Looks cool tho. Semi auto needs a hard hitting laser. Prob coud nerf a bit before the release it tho.
---
Do I have to "unlock" it from a pack first? It doesn't show up as a perk card I have currently.
---
I have an ammo bug in 1st person view.  Often it tells me I have ‚Äúincorrect ammo‚Äù for my weapons when I‚Äôm carrying plenty of the right ammo.  At times it happens to all 4 weapons I carry at the same time which can be fatal.  Each time I fast travel, I have a chance to have this occur.  Super annoying.
---
weapons I go for 2* so I have more rolls.. 3rd star would be nice but none of them are make or break for my build
---
armor i go 3*
---
It's because at this point it just doesn't feel like there's much to do. The game economy is broken so there's no real point in farming like in other mmo games end games, and the end game feels as baren as the wasteland itself.
---
Praxis
---
Yeah
---
Holy crap thought I was the only one ugh
---
Idk I'd need to play around on the terminal to see what's possible, but some basic trivial things could be like an obstcal course, a fight pit, race through a maze. I call it a pipe dream because we would need more budget space an old mechanics pike picking things up and throwing them for more fun options.
---
I feel the same way when I‚Äôm at a machine and see the same played out asylum outfit for 20k. First there in every machine now just like The tenderizer, it‚Äôs not worth 15k now, to many have dropped but I don‚Äôt have to buy them. Some are crazy with greed in the game. It‚Äôs our decision to spend or roll on out.
---
That is a temporary issue, before that came out it was a very good perk
---
Well yeah, you prove my point.  250 makes the weapon worth a fraction of the price.  So it‚Äôs another reason not to go for 3* range weapons at the purveyor.  I‚Äôm a big trader (I sold 90K worth of stuff yesterday alone), and I will absolutely buy 250 weapons.  Of course I only buy them when they are CHEAP. I‚Äôll buy a B/FFR250 .45 SMG for 2K.  It‚Äôs a gamble to see if/when Bethesda fixes it. If it‚Äôs fixed, the gun is worth 12K or so. Right now it isn‚Äôt.
---
Temporary maybe.  It‚Äôs been broken for minimally two patches and/or 2+ months.  So, who knows when it will be fixed.  I mean they fixed the social menu issues with the last patch, right? üòú
---
I‚Äôve sat down inadvertently too many times to count, but when/where has opening a loading door been an issue?
---
True. But a 90 weight on a rifle is crazy good. Free deep pocket mod. 15% reload can make black powder tolerable. (With speed deamon.) 25 ap is the most sought after and highly op
---
Just saying 3* is a must when looking for upgrades to already good stuff. You have low odds for sure.. But your odds are zero if you play it safe and keep with 2*
---
You friggin win all things sir! I hope you both live together happily forever.
---
Make a camp structure that is over 9 stories tall. I think it's possible but don't know that anyone has accomplished it.
---
What would I have on each floor
---
I'll gladly help ya out with quests. I'm bored too, and all my pals are busy with personal lives so all I do is atomic quests. PSN: Mulders-Smoulder
---
It‚Äôs not great once you mod the gun.  90 is pretty overrated.  On a rifle I‚Äôd prefer reload or 15% vats. 
---
I look at it this way, if I get a single 2* BE, B/FFR, VE,AAE, etc. it‚Äôs a trade chip towards the BE Gatling Plasma I really want.  The odds of the BE Plasma dropping from the purveyor isn‚Äôt very high. ü§îüòú
---
Yeah, I was talking about levers in my prior post.  I should have clarified.  90 is probably great on Handmades since they are crazy heavy now.  
---
I have no clue what my best purveyor drop was.  I got a JE 10mm SMG last week. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I remember people selling it on PS4 back in the day. it's not a bannable offense to have one and/or know how to craft them, Bethesda said so. so just politely ask someone with one, or in the market.
---
My boys and I both play, but we only have 1 Xbox. So we've never been able to team up. Congrats to you too find something to share with your dad that you both enjoy, wish I could as well!

If you move the placement of the c.a.m.p hibachi grill it will adjust your fast travel spawn point.  Its not an exact science and it can be tedious but its possible.
---
I camped on that spot recently and 50% of the time when I joined a server the CAMP location was already taken. Spot's too popular.
---
I would buy that... But i found the signs plan and panicked cause some guys was buying stuff from my shop. 8k gone. Then i figured i had to start the grind again so i just hopped from camp to camp buying up 308 and fusion cells. Give me some time and give me a price. I love my junkies stuff.
---
What's that very valuable thing?
---
I got a copy at 20 and it's not worth that honestly. It's a good game but all the glitches and higher level bosses every 20 minutes is a bit overkill for me liking it
---
Perfectly preserved pie is a world spawn on the roof of West-Tek. It's just not as valuable in this game compared to the other Fallouts.
---
enough people cry about it so its only a matter of time..
---
you should take the time until they eventually come out to consider what its going to do to your camp and stash budget so you can have a good plan of action ready
---
76 is my first Fallout. Always liked realistic games in the past (pretty much CS/BF/COD), FO is very refreshing with realistic environment and fantasy mutated beasts.  People hate the RNG component but it adds fun to the gameplay, in a realistic way. In a real world wasteland scenario you‚Äôll never know what you‚Äôll find when you search a container or a dead body.
---
I didn't try to shoehorn my NW perks into my mains, I made a character just for NW.
---
My main NW character is 114, and I've gained 80+ levels in Adventure and 30k caps. I enjoy the mode, so it was never tedious.
---
I'm impressed. If you haven't figured it out (you have) when she curses its because she's passionate about it. The only time she really dropped curse words is when it involved you disappearing with little to no explanation. Take it from a married guy, if she drops an F-bomb in argument concede the point, even if you're right, and tuck tail.
---
Also, CONGRATS!

And dang Bethesda (Lady D), way to go with being the proposal wingman! F.

To access the dev room, they had to modify a game file that removed a specific wall from the game, allowing access to the dev room.

Something that isn't possible on consoles.

you don't really need to do that in order to clip through walls, though.

Of course I care thanks for sharing!  Where did you find your new friend?  What color did you get the purple one?  I am happy you got one!

Granade Launcher,frog legs,granadier,demo expert. Best damage output i have got to a dude have been over 300.
---
Ya I'd of bought that. Was dissapointed in a junkies fat man i got today. I have a ts and it wrecks face. Survival it get players 3/4 health while blinding them. Had so much fun last week. Sadly the junkies does more single damage and its a 90 üòÅ but i think guns not hit scan are not bound by the same rules as say a laser or rifle.
---
Now on the hunt for a ts missle launcher to confirm the ts meta is not dead... Just only untouched in launchers.
---
Thanks i found it in a random location right next to reception tower EL-B1-02 in savage divide up the bear in the map and it was a normal infected one
---
I run berserker and the "class" definitely needs a buff somewhere. I don't mind dying often as that is part of my play style with this character, but there definitely should be another perk or mutation that buffs your resistant in a way that doesn't effect DR and in effect alter damage. There are plenty of perks that flat out buff DR but the ones that actually mitigate damage are few. I mean there is fireproof, blocker, and ricochet, as well as dodgy as serendipity... But those all mostly come with even more tradeoffs. Ive been able to become pretty tanky in a few senses but my best bet is going with sneak and killing stuff quickly.
---
Yeah I enjoy the 10mm SMG, it‚Äôs a fun gun. I‚Äôm going to make a new character at some point to use the several bloodied 10mm SMGs I‚Äôve found so far.  It will be different than the normal handmade commando.
---
No, it's 20% dmg for every hit after the first, yours, and theirs.
---
Harper's ‚õ¥Ô∏è 4 locks
---
Oh man I really miss it
---
Needs a mod to remove the sight. Seems like its only good in hip fire with tru stuff and that sucks cause i Never play 3rd.
---
I‚Äôm used to hip firing from playing a heavy so much.
---
Make a strength build with heavy guns
---
It's my understanding that modifying was the only way to access.
---
what?  why wouldn't you read the rules?  also why would you post something you didn't know when you could literally take two seconds to know and have that knowledge reflected in your post?
---
Beautiful!!!!! Congrats!!! Make sure you invite Biv to your wedding :)
---
That would be great because this game is too easy. Bethesda should create new game mode called hardcore where everything is 3x as strong as in adventure mode
---
f04
---
It is a part of this quest [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Someone\_to\_Talk\_To](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Someone_to_Talk_To)
---
As far as i remember you usualy turn it in at the end of the quest but a bugg might cause it to remain in your Inventory. Also check if the quest is active for you at the moment
---
Let's face facts, Mole miners aren't real moles
---
It does that for a while after the nuke zone dissipates.
---
Ugh, that would suck. I think mission checkpoints also need some work. No reason why you couldn‚Äôt go back and finish the rest of the quest.
---
Mystery pick is in just 2 days though.
---
Lol no..I got it for 20$ which it was
---
If your on PS4 I have the plan. 
---
PSN: Radcooldude55YT
---
What platform are you on?
---
This was my experience tonight.  Multi second delay in registering wood, prime cuts on grill, greens, etc.
---
  Also did a power up energy plant, same issue.  I went around repairing, and it eventually registered them all.
---
PC
---
Thats common no bug.
---
I drew two identical auto grenade launchers in three attempts today.  The third was another heavy weapon.
---
Thanks i have been wondering this a long time
---
I scored a [Forest](https://i.imgur.com/zWv2IAv.jpg) one and curious to the market value, I think for the forest it goes 20+k. I think it goes wht/brn/grn/blue/pink/yellow/red/forest as to rarity.
---
So if I make a new character will I still have thes same overseering rank?
---
Were the Grenade Launchers Executioner‚Äôs?
---
Its always done this, it might eventually change back to normal flora but if it does it takes a long time and I've never stuck around long enough to see it. 
---
Another weird thing I noticed with whitesprings, sometimes(not always) the ghoul spawns keep the higher chance of legendaries, and if you clean out all the glowing ones after the nuke dissipates. When the enemies respawn it will replace every ghoul with robots, and the spawn levels and amount of legendaries are glitched out or something.
---
I went to the clubhouse one time under these circumstances and there was like 5 or 6 level 1 legendary eyebots, that dropped level 1 legendary weapons. The rest of the spawns were also level 1 eyebots. I couldnt seem to recreate this after they tweaked the levels of things that spawn a while back.
---
Actually if you'd seen all his videos he mostly posts positive things about the game, he covers the bad stuff too (and im guessing theyre the ones youtube pushes to more people)  
---
But generally speaking he seems pretty un-biased and just wants the game to improve
---
Thanks, guess I‚Äôm not alone here
---
Yeah I do think so as well. But I think they would have to disable legendary effect cause the PvP implications if you used a full set of assassin's sentinel's armor underneath power armor would make you almost unkillable
---
This made me lol as a level 99 dad who's son got distracted from playing around level 30.
---
I've had this quest pop up 3 times since the patch that fixed it, I'm convinced there is still a problem with daily quests.
---
They broke the first crane they used to try and lynch the elephant.... but they just got a bigger crane and got the job done.   
---
Because screw reconsidering your choices.
---
Picture of a dead elephant that‚Äôs hanging from a crane, possibly nsfw: https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3ridwjc9ci8/V7KE2d5JfnI/AAAAAAAAKy4/gIrjE2kIlZ89EapbSDTdZg9Qqpzeli90QCLcB/s1600/Murderous_Mary_1916.jpg
---
I should‚Äôve worded that differently I meant like a shielded brotherhood Officer suit or so something along the lines of that
---
Could be  bovinophobia.
---
Atom shop thing, 300 smackaroo atoms
---
If you can get to the purveyor rolling a good 2 star   is a good way to go.
---
Welp, better white knight a corporation.
---
Wait, you only give them one name each?
---
No wonder they killed them, you don't deserve them, you monster.
---
I mean, it's a game world, everything is artificial, they could all be 0 pounds, or hell, negative pounds that let you carry more.
---
No, of course not! Each head gets a name.
---
Bessie's a little bit of a wanderer, but Daisy keeps her from sneaking off *too* far.
---
In this day and age? Absolutely sickening.
---
It gives you agility, which boosts your AP, which can be used to mitigate incoming damage. Plus, better Stealth, which helps avoid conflict and increased your attacks, which leads to shorter battles and less risk of dying.
---
but is mystery pick worth it? debateable.
---
Depends on the discount.
---
It's clearly a joke mang
---
They should rotate.
---
This is awesome! Congrats!
---
That's a stretch. Well I actually have the gear you're dreaming about and I'm dying after 600+ hours of nothing posing a challenge.
---
I've had that quest reset on me too, multiple times so I gave up. 50 odd levels later, I'm in a nuke zone near prime (just helped take out the queen) and I walk over to the Glassed Cavern. I went through it to the end, grabbed Taggerdy's ID card and jumped to Fort Defiance. Went in her room, the quest updated and completed and I got the rewards. 
---
I hadn't even STARTED the quest  chain again, I just went to the end and finished it up.
---
Remember when only certain people had nice things?
---
Heavy weapon perks are not available right away, so be patient. Most people begin as 2h melee and switch to heavy guns as it becomes available. My advice would be to use the best hunting rifle until you start building for real.
---
I think it really depends on what platform and what region.
---
Ok. Thanks!
---
Last time I saw a l√°ser musket was not in this game. I have been playing since launch... PS4.
---
No, overseer ranks are tied to characters. Rewards are account based.
---
I'm the opposite, i like that it changes but feel it doesn't change enough. I get they intended to switch it to go with the newest update, but we've had this ome for a while now. They could have at least shown the morgantown NW map after that was added.
---
This kind of response is the reason
---
Possibly the same kind of arseholes who gave their friends all their caps so they could trash random bases for no reason before bases became invincible to other players outside of combat.
---
I‚Äôve killed someone‚Äôs Brahmin before because he deserved it. Otherwise I just milk them.
---
My boy is five and he says he will play Fallout when he gets older. So far, he can do some magic at Rayman Legends.
---
First off, BE weapons sell for really good caps, easily all of them are over 5k or a minumum of 5k.
---
Secondly, did you just say you sold an explosive melee weapon?
---
lol'd
---
Go die
---
Im not trying to be mean, you literally have to die to get rid of it.
---
Gone are the days of requiring a Doctor's Bag to heal broken body parts.
---
I miss you, New Vegas.
---
Why can‚Äôt like 80% of the shop be already in game? It‚Äôs so dang easy. Keep the fancy and fun decorative like cool statues and vases as atomic shop items. Give us a few free wallpapers. I just want my janky houses to have some janky wallpaper choices is all. 
---
As for skins, they should apply to EVERYTHING. want a power armor America skin? Well, it also comes in Pip-Boy, pistol, and switchblade (among other things)! I‚Äôve been saving my atomic points for skin bundles. And the Vault series one is just campy enough that I won‚Äôt buy it. Give me blood stain, camo, anything!
---
You're raising him right haha!
---
He has far from a "hate boner" for 76. Even his dissapointment and critiques of the game are from a calm, level-headed perspective, and he points out when he likes things.
---
Explosive weapons in general cause alot of lag if theres people around. Its probably got more to do with how much stuff people are carrying around though. If you carry around a ton of stuff like 30 weapons and 100 outfits and an aid section that takes ages to get to the bottom plus all those notes people dont throw away, it makes you a huge server strain. It will make you lag, and anyone near you. 
---
When you give those people tse gatling plasma's it causes intense framedrops, fucks up the audio and overall makes it a bad time when your fighting the queen or any large group of enemies. 
---
 Ive had queen fights where it runs smooth and great and theres no explosive guns, then one guy shows up with an explosive weapon and the frames drop to like 4fps and the sound bugs out and everything gets sketchy.
---
The first time I noticed this was the first meat week event, a guy showed up with an explosive gatling laser and his gun was a lag switch. Every time he fired my fps dropped super low and the game ate all my inputs and made it impossible to play. 
---
This can happen in PvP as well, ive been shot by explosive laser rifles(with whichever reciever sets you on fire) and my game would freeze for a short time every time he shot me, not giving me a chance to fight to back. 
---
Its anecdotal but it seems to happen to me too likely to be a coincidence.
---
Everytime time the game lags around others,  I look around and see people shooting splodies.
---
I guess. But really, how likely is it they'll see this one random post on Reddit at nearly midnight? Like, you'd think they'd wanna see a reaction. All they got was the in-game equivalent of " &gt;:( ".
---
Maybe give people who have the mod ability to convert them into plans that they can sell for a profit?
---
Why does this pic look so much better than what mine do? I‚Äôm using a RTX 2070x too. Hmm...
---
Jet, not even once kids.
---
Definitely!
---
No, but you also can't cram everything you own into one footlocker. So, win some lose some.
---
I play it because I enjoy it. It's not previous fallouts, and I hope future fallouts aren't like it, but as it is, it's enjoyable most of the time.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Nearly happened to me on my first silo run yesterday. Thankfully, I had checked the map and noticed another squad was also at Site Charlie, so I backed out and left the second half for them.
---
Ive switched over to NW for a while so i could grind the mark and hellfire paints
---
Any idea when that update is? Been wanting to play again since people were talking about a coming update but didn't hear the date?
---
Ah yes, but everything and everywhere can become my footlocker lol so long as my neighbors grow smaller and smaller jk
---
I‚Äôd love lots more creatures based on creatures that we would see in different environments. I mean, they‚Äôre doing a good job with what they‚Äôve added, but I was feral cats and maybe some hideous monster slugs and stuff. I just think it‚Äôs be cool to add them as the updates go.
---
Thank you, I was scratching my head trying to figure out why the atom challenge wouldn't complete.
---
:( I get way more sad when that happens than I should. I'm sorry for your loss and for a-holes.
---
I only just noticed it like a week ago when the mission started to act up
---
White,brown,green,blue,yellow,forest,red,pink or pink,red.
---
Tbh long hold should be every action that isn‚Äôt the basic neutral one, because a lot of buttons have multiple functions depending on the circumstances long hold would be a good reliable solution, like man the amount of times I and the amount of times  I‚Äôve seen people holding the vats crit button when  in power armour just jump out for no logical reason  other then the fact that there ap ran out and they were still holding there action button
---
Say that after you go to my store and find what you are looking for.
---
Thank you. I'm mostly just upset that it was players and not our neighbor Yogi, the asshole glowing Yao Guai that usually spawns right outside our camp. At least that would have made sense, why would someone do this to their fellow Vault dwellers?
---
Poor coordination.
---
Well I cant argue with u, even when it comes to console verse pc totally agree. My computer now is a nice computer but it is no gaming computer and I cant justify spending the money to buy a new computer for one game, maybe that's how I justify spending the 50.00 each year for ps4 online, I guess I see it a cheaper since all my games are already with ps4. Lol I guess I argued my point with out thinking about it I'm such a dinghy...lol I was apposed at first because the game was 60.00 then when it went to 15.00 I said "I will give it a try" I will say I haven't looked back yet. I have joined a group on here that are very like minded a good group of players called PKOA, if u ever change ur mind look me up PSN: RoninRage0352 I will stick to my offer and hook u up with gear to start out with. Thank u for the comment and maybe I will see u in Appalachia my friend
---
I've had players kill my Brahmin right in front of me to be dicks and it's upsetting. However, about  15 minutes ago, I accidentally threw a grenade at my Brahmin, Rufus, and killed him while trying to figure out how to take a picture, so I'm clearly a terrible person as well.
---
Congrats you two. Awesome Bethesda helped make it even better.
---
Number, not amount.
---
Youtubers are countable.
---
I bought the camo and the blood stained. Its sucks because I switched to scout armor and cant apply it. But it is what it is. Thanks for the comment
---
Sounds like exp to me.
---
Congrats from a fellow South Dakotan!
---
No witch-hunting.
---
I just realized I had to pieces of medic legendary armor so now I just self revive ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Gotta supply what the people want. .308 .45. 5.56 fusion cells, shotguns shells, 5mm and .50 Cal.  Everything else I'll store maybe 500 of.
---
Today I had a wendigo glitch into a rock.  I could kill it but not extract the DNA.  I hopped servers and the quest relaunched again and I was able to complete it.
---
I keep getting "investigate Berkely Springs" over and over.  I did it seven times in two hours one day.  To complete the quest I often have to log out and log back in because Chloe won't launch dialogue.  Sometimes Boomer won't talk to me to launch that quest either.
---
Mire quests are still messed up, at least for me.
---
Never played it, but you would think they would keep it up until wastelanders was released.
---
Maybe it has to do with stability? 
---
Like taking down the survival servers to make the normal ones run better? 
---
I don‚Äôt know how that would work, but I‚Äôm not in charge
---
They were obviously role playing as cattle rustlers.
---
Right? Why wouldn‚Äôt camo be able to be put on anything? Why can‚Äôt I just find green and black paint in game and POOF! Now I have camo.
---
I always thought it was me twisting my ankle. I randomly do that in real life. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Your right. Now I feel.loke a dick.....
---
That's pretty much what happened. Hell, the third or fourth time one of the bastards fired a mini nuke. A mini nuke! Who even uses those?
---
And hey, don't feel bad. Every brahmin owner accidentally takes out their cattle now and then. They're like us: they don't die, they just respawn.
---
Well they aren't very good at it then, they didn't even get Bessie and Daisy out of the front gate!
---
Can't you just buy it? It only costs 2 tadpole tokens.
---
Players like these are why I trust no one ingame anymore. My C.A.M.P is hidden. I removed my vending machines. And if I see anyone near my C.A.M.P (very rare) or near me close to a workshop I either leave the game to the menu &amp; find a new server, or fast travel away asap.
---
Lol right thanks for the laugh, I just woke up to play since they are going down for maintenance tomorrow need to get some gaming in..lol but your right wish it was that easy.
---
Ultracite shows the jetpack option on arms, legs and helmet. But for every piece it says it can be crafted on it actually only appears on back of torso, just like any other PA.
---
Who knows about this raider set. But very hard to believe it could have torso and arms with 3 working jetpacks lol.
---
Because you'll log in outside and chances are there will be a nuke
---
Same here. Me and my 12 yo son regularly traipse through F76's Appalachia together.  
---
I have raised him as a gamer so hopefully this continues through the years and we can play many games together in the future.
---
In general people have been pretty great, but I've definitely run into a couple of real "winners".  And I don't even play that often.  There's one in every bunch...
---
i always just assume i stubbed my toe while running or tripped cause im a damn klutz.
---

---
Pretty sure they are pulling it for server performance and capacity. Makes sense if it's not popular.
---
Bullets
---
Thanks I hope I can find him again and give him a legacy weapon or something
---
You have to unlock "hacker" and "expert hacker" before "master hacker" is avalible.
---
Also. You can't save up the level ups. You can't stop using level ups at level 10 and use them all at level 50. Because if you are level 50 that level 10 level up will still only show level 10 perks or below.
---
It feels better that way, the cold hard steel rubbing your privates was the main design of power armor. Everything else was designed around this feature. FACT
---
...and FONV if you have the right trait.
---
It's the same with mats used to make thing. Separate stash for workshops and camps. I know for sure I have 100+ more screws in m workshops then I do my camp.
---
a trio dropped on my camp near Bolton greens the other day and i was woefully unprepared. waves and waves of scorched were the biggest problem, they seemed neverending there were so many.
---
the best part was the other players coming by and shopping at my vendors while i struggled to stave off the attack. thanks for the help (not!) people!!!
---
Epic cool, Bethesda. See everyone at 1,000.
---
Bye Survival, you wont be missed.
---
Look on EBay. I bought a brand new copy for ¬£10.
---
I got a headache reading that
---
Or just wait 30 seconds and they auto-heal themselves. =/
---
Who gives a flying fuck about you (1) steel and (1) razorgrain? I sure don't.
---
it will come back after wastelanders is all sorted out and balanced :P
---
i have accidentally gotten wanted a couple of times, i usually head to whitesprings, there are almost always high levels there eager to take a pop. once i did have to go into chat with a guy to explain why I'd gotten wanted and assure him i wasnt trying to bait him into pvp before he'd kill me.
---
Keep it for PC... We can always push more power or change settings.. Damn it im sad to see it go. Got top kills fpr the week... Unless those two camping harpers caught more victims. üòì
---
If Bethesda put as much effort as this into their main game it would be an amazing game. Congrats man.
---
No, forest and red are worth more than pink, red is easily super super rare.
---
I got it from g2a for like 21 euros i think, check there aswell
---
With survival mode getting dropped you should see somewhat more populations
---
You're basically earning $1 per 100 atoms you unlock through challenges. That's even more accurate
---
If you want the Wendigo that is the reward from a quest that starts when you pick up and read a piece of paper on a table in front of the Southern Belle motel in the Mire.
---
thirst was definitely draining fast for me today (Monday) and possibly yesterday as well.
---
I haven't had this issue. Could it be a server thing or does it happen often?
---
Nice job bro!! I always like seeing ppls collection
---
ah I'm missing just one yet, i can't wait to catch em all!
---
Yep, it's the easiest way to collect it if you just need inert flux, or if you have the fluids and mass already.
---
they stay for a while after a nuke, same thing with gloing ones if no one has killed them.
---
ohhh i was wondering why i haven't been getting the alpha finisher to that quest! meat week is too blame.
---
So fking annoying. I had a guy place his camp right on top of fast travel spawn point of the event and so people kept getting stuck on his foundation. Had to fast travel out and fast travel back. I can't believe people are crying that Bethesda is making them move their camps. Bet they are all trolls. There's a reason why they are making you move
---
Johnny Sins is her ex
---
I encountered the robots once and was like WHAAAAATTT. I had fun with it, though. Even had some legendaries in there. Was a nice change of pace. Made me miss Watoga legendary bots, though.
---
I spend a good chunk of my vendor income on ammo, but I find that 5.56 is really hard to come by. I found 4000 for 1c in a single vendor last week and I almost did a little dance. :-)
---
one way to get it back in the day was from dev room, and only ppl from PC had access to it(that i know off)
---
I've been asking for this for the ENTIRE time. :(
---
we had it, then BGS took it away.
---
Inside cells are safe.
---
This isn't the first time they've done something for fans of Fallout either
---
silos, power plants have a few terminal as well.
---
why, I have been playing from day one and I dont have a legacy weapon, havent used one in my play time which is more than 500+ hours. the truth be told you just sound salty and are using the noobies as an excuse.
---
If your on xbox I'll give you some t45 and t60 if I have it still. Trying to get rid of most of my power armour for stash space
---
this. i store all my excess 5.56 in the vendor at 2c per. with max ammosmith and super duper i can always craft myself plenty more if some high roller decides he needs 7000 bullets for the low low price of 14k. And if no one buys it, i will eventually use it so it's win win.
---
Me too.
---
Yep I want a 90% weight reduction Shepard's crook, shovel, fat man and assualtron head to carry at all times
---
all the damn time.
---
dont pay attention to that crazyness, they are a few that are ok to see.
---
are you a youtuber? sound salty
---
They are kinda rare even on xbox honestly. Definitely were more common before the 2 other game modes came out, and I'm guessing they will be back in adventure when survival is gone tomorrow
---
That's awesome. I've been wondering about that but always forget to check
---
A couple nights in a row. Mods too.
---
Yep site alphas surrounding cliffs seem to spawn mothmen and flat woods occasionally. Could just be because I camped near there and was there more often but I never saw them outside of that area
---
but its for grabs at the morgantown overseer stash ( the mini version)
---
the big backpack is easy, I did archer, athlete and codebreaker. the hardest thing was launching a nuke if that counts as been hard.
---
how do you expand your emote wheel like that in the video?
---
he's looking for The Fixer tho. not caps
---
I've never seen a laser musket or legacy explosive laser gun at a Prime Cuts event, and I play on PC. Although I have seen lots of selfish players with bloodied builds and explosive handmades one- and two-shotting everything including the legendary hermit crab at the end.
---
I've also, to be fair, seen a lot of people moderating their damage output so more people could tag the mobs.
---
so that there is no downside to hazmait suits?
---
I find the only thing that sometimes works for inaccessible enemies is explosives.  And it doesn‚Äôt work most of the time.
---
How much are the hats worth
---
Actually second thoughts don't bother putting their names here, everyone's right it's not good. I don't want to get you in to trouble.
---
Fall, probably November
---
Think leather armor variants should also be wearable under power armors. I mean it's not bulky at all doesn't make any sense we have to unequip leather armors when entering power armors
---
GL is much more accurate, GP recoil is like trying to hold a squirming mole rat.  GP often does a bit more damage when it hits.
---
The "your life must suck because you did something I didn't like in a video game" thing is really ironic considering how upset you are over an interaction in a video game. You must have been pretty mad to get comm banned over it. I say this all the time... it's just a game. Those guys probably don't care nearly as much about the game as you. Lmao.
---
that's what I do now that uranium fever is crap.
---
Okay got it.
---
i'd forgot all about meat week. little desire to play it right now though.
---
Durability is the size of the bar, Condition is how much of it is filled.
---
take some enemies to their camp and sit there, get the popcorn ready. if the show up and shot the animals kindly walk in front off their bullets and shot back. troll the troll is my motto.
---
I'm sure their parents would floor you because they probably arent a sensitive manchild who's offended that others exercise their freedom not to raise their kid as sheltered babies. It's just a game so who cares who is playing it, kids see worse things scrolling through Facebook or watching anything related to halloween.
---
I just wish they added new rewards. It just seems so lazy not adding anything new and expecting people to go crazy. Or atleast bump the script up to atleast 10 or 20 for the prime meat
---
Good riddance. It's just gotten worse and worse with all the nerfs to PvP and broken mechanics.
---
You can understand the concept of RPing and still think this is cringe as fuck. 
---
You're basically roleplaying a stalker that gets overly obsessed. Might want to examine why immersing in such a role feels rewarding...
---
I love roleplaying, but I've never felt the need to roleplay as a rapist. If you can't connect the dots as to why people are looking at you funny for this, you *really* need to examine why you enjoy it!
---
Borderlands 3....
---
I heard one guy on youtube say "The funny thing about Fallout 76 is that its actually WORSE now than it was a launch!!"
---
Ive never wanted to slap someone through a screen so badly before.
---
i havent had any in a week, but it can be that I havent played in a week. lol

---
I get your pain before I did get DC often.
---
I gota boast a lil bit. The first day of came back I got all 3 tenderizer plans, which I didnt have, and then i got my own tenderizer a couple days ago :) all i need now is the tato salad recipie and I'm good to go! I agree tho it has been more difficult to complete the events due to a lack of support. My only solution is to just keep server hopping until you see a good population on the events. That and hop after the cookouts too because most people actually doing take a break from the grind after it.
---
Dam I have the opposite with boomer since yesterday I have not been able to get it to go past the talk to boomer stage, he just sits there and moans about being broken
---
I'm fine with one a pop but being able to turn in more would be cool
---
I‚Äôm on the PC so that might be why my experience is different. No clue why I got downvoted when I was just trying to figure out more about the issue.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'll have to dig it up in the morning. It's a high Int build, with Charisma next (I used to be 15 and 12 but I lowered both a bit). Str and End 4, after that, it gets murky.
---
Saying "lmao" at your own statement is lame as hell.
---
Bad architecture.
---
You raised him right!
---
Got mine completed a while ago and need to use 3 to complete the challenge. But it looks too nice as a set. And the weight is in camp budget I think?!
---
Mire Daily challenge Queen of the Hunt.
---
Go through searching the 3 spots it gives you. You don't want to complete the mission and you don't want to search the cryptids.. I don't recall if you don't kill them though.
---
Then just hop servers doing the same thing until you come across the Flatwoods Monster as one of the possibilities.
---
Much better chance rate on this event then in a random encounter location.
---
Yup, I‚Äôve got maybe 60K rounds of 5.56, but I‚Äôll go through it eventually.  If I sell some for high caps in the meantime, cool. üëç
---
Ah I see
---
The Stings and Things quest has 6 mounted insects total. You're missing the mounted Stingwing and Bloodbug.  
---
If by "all the mounts" you mean stuff like the Scorchbeast and Mohtman ones I am pretty sure the are unreleased at the moment.   
---
Hope that helps.
---
&gt;FFR is one of  the best secondary effects as it is a straight DPS bonus that works all the time and doesn't require investing in perks to maximize.  Some people actually prefer it over explosive.
---
Only issue with FFR, faster degredation of weapon condition, which I understand is all ready fast on Gatlings.
---
The 2nd is an Ulatracite, which has PitA ammo
---
Maybe you're just playing dumb or maybe you really are but the "lmao" is me laughing at the OP.
---
So they should punish players who have been here since the begging by taking their things??? New players arent being punished, they can get other weapons that are just as effective.
---
Idk i think one a pop is a little too low for an hourly event, i guess its just me. Specially only being able to turn in 150 a day. Sometimes i can't even play because i have so many things to script to the point my stash is full and i cant move. I love this game but there's so many little things that should be easy to fix that could make this game soooo much better.
---
Claw of my life.
---
Removing the product doesn't help the market, it removes it.
---
My though is that Berseker is fine, IF it only counted DR granted by Armour. Perk DR or DR from items that don't count as Armour should count.
---
Or flat buff the damage bonus. 
---
Though I do not want *anything* to be buffed to be on par with Bloodied **Builds**
---
So is this inspired from fallout? Or was fallout inspired by this?
---
Lol
---
Yes, 
---
1. Tea time with 1000billion appearances
---
2. All other low level events (except horde which i haven't seen recently)
---
3. Some-timers events that could be fun but get ruined by 1-shotters like uranium fever or one violent night
---
4. That one quest you actually want to do. (for me project paradise which i was able to get in on once)
---
;)
---
Then you have to run around "powered down" or using alt weapons while waiting for your armour to get broken. 
---
Bloodied has no where near the same set up time.
---
Yeah, they still need some work on this Mire dailies - before you couldn't play them at all, now I can sometimes do 4-5 a day (record was almost 4 times Play Time - 3 time successfully finished, third time quests started, but robot looped in the speech). Not that I can complain - it's easy and fast quests with good rewards.
---
Are you sure you've seen multiple laser muskets at the event..? That is just not very probable.
---
It seems pretty clear to me that the negative reception (which was mostly warranted for) will never go away in some gaming circles -- notably the YT content creators and their followers. Every time anything slightly bad happens in or around the game they go for the clicks, and that's understandable too because they make money that way. As long as we have platforms that reward spreading rumours for ignorant masses then this will happen.
---
I'ts OK for me though, because I couldn't care a flying flipper what they think of this game, haven't had this much fun in an on-line RPG since the 90's. There is still a lot to fix but I'm enjoying my time and consider my money well spent.
---
Or actually fix the Gatling guns to work properly lol. I found myself getting bored of fo76 from the sheer lack of different gear. It's all RNG and hardly any crafting (unless that's changed in the last several months). I just want to be able to find decent guns and craft parts for them instead of grinding in an RNG system for parts and special rolls. Laser muskets would be rad. They are pretty heavy on cell use and suck in fo4 but it might be fun to get some different star drops on them in 76.
---
*Senku voice* There is a 10 billion percent chance that they want us to do more Tea Time.
---
That's a separate issue.
---
I'll simplify my response for you: I agree.
---
Could you submit a ticket with as much information as you can, including your username, here:
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
Please let me know the ticket number when it's in!
---
Also, going off other comments in this thread, could you use fast.com and tell me what speed you're getting? This info might be useful to send forward.
---
I just meant that you're right about there needing to be more crafting options and variety butbits separate from my request for the laser musket to come back.
---
NO
---
I do not want to see Bloodied 6-crank Muskets Stealth Killing Event bosses thanks
---
Deal with Bloodied first, then maybe.
---
Dont use a splitter amd legacy lasers will ruin anything. You're not going to get much support for making them better.
---
Fair. It would be nice to see the devs do something more than try and maintain a dying player base and adding absurd amounts of IAP cosmetics. 
---
Gib real content plz
---
Black powder firearms actually make perfect sense in the FO world. The ingredients are readily available to harvest. They are simple, and get the job done. 
---
A black powder pipe gun firing cast lead bullets will probably be the first post-apocalyptic world guns when the parts and rounds for cased ammo firearms runout
---
Their is a powerful build option available and so you are opposed to new gear being added to the game? That's just silly. They could still bring it back and balance it.
---
I have several explo GPs; they are hands down one of the most op weapons currently in game. If you get hold of one, you'll see.
---
New free content.... 2 weapons and an outfit once a month or so.
---
Atom Shop: Tons of new clothing, skins, camp items, hair styles, and even game mechanics like refrigeration and scrap bots every week without fail.
---
That's not my argument, they just arent viable ingame. Period.
---
Are you saying that's what they add or what you would want to see?
---
Oh shut up. Why don't we have a vote and get them rules sorted?
---
I've been online since the mid ninetees, and never ever has silencing anyone contributed to anything contructive, on the contrary.
---
They want to be famous assholes of the wastelands? Lets make them more famous than they really want.
---
Remember the DDoS attacks on PS Networks Christmas Eve a few years ago? Didn't stop before the two UK kids got doxed to hell and back and people started fucking with them IRL.
---
Actions have consequences.
---
Fuck the fucking fuckers.
---
That's the current state of things.
---
Agree, I'm running a solo stealth bloodied commando because it simply is the most viable solo build. The only time I die is when the stealth bugs out.
---
Even if I wouldn't change my gear I still hope other builds would be as viable.
---
Hm. *insert Elon smoking boof image* maybe I'll have to give it another go.
---
Lets be fair, if you go into a nuke zone, you are walking in there with Power Armor 9/10 times. If you give us the option to walk in there with a Hazmat suit with our own armor underneath, it would give you more incentive to not carry around 10 pounds of metal, but something lighter. The only downside is, you don't get a chest piece cause of the oxygen tanks on your back, but this is Fallout.
---
Could feed them their personal info to read, see how much they laugh.
---
I've been looking for tea time the whole morning to complete the Atom challenge and haven't seen it a single time.
---
Wait. Why? Free content is rare and minimal while the microtransactions shop has new content all the time. That's bad, not good.
---
Why don't you go to a LAN with that attitude? Tippes over the tower of a aimbotter once, I'll happily do it again.
---
Can I get some Plasma Grenade plans lol?
---
Oh. So it is exactly how I left it lol. Myb I misread your message somehow. *4chantard.png*
---
Don't use demo expert use gunsmith u do need the extra damage if ur using legacy. If u want better durability use a AAE or be then a TSE laser
---
Bruh event bosses already go down in like 3 minutes ez
---
Sure when Bethesda gives us the option to have our own armor underneath a Hazmat suit
---
PM me their gamertags if don't feel like posting them
---
Thank you for doing these! It‚Äôs great to see someone making this easier for the Devs to see!
---
Now we just have to hope they follow these suggestions/fixes... (Plasma Grenade plans, please... I‚Äôm waiting...)
---
So the attitude of "don't take video games so serious" is too much for you? Also, fo76 on a LAN? This isn't balders gate bud.
---
basing your wish for a buff on the durability pf a weapon that shoulfnt exist in the first play isnt really effective
---
Fusion cells? I can't even sell them for 0 caps, I end up discarding them.
---
Those few scrips isn't worth the hustle if you already have all rewards...
---
Personal trading
---
Yes, those items have no condition on them.
---
Thx for quick answer dude
---
Right, so laser muskets wouldn't change anything. A BE heavy weapon or BFSS melee weapon is gonna melt bosses faster than any laser musket.
---
Collect HM, HRF, and GM first for sure, best place is obviously white springs. Then, get a nuke down in the big and throw on green thumb. Best of luck
---
I have the "YOU HAVE BEEN INSULTED" note from the insult bot up for 25k :P
---
When was there a problem?
---
And yest stable flux doesnt degrade
---
Nothing I hate more than spending 50 caps to fast travel to an event just to watch the boss go down as I load in.
---
True but I don't think laser muskets would make that problem worse. Lol.
---
Yup your own spawn is directly to the north, other players will spawn in roughly 5m to the left of your spot.
---
No not at all. I would imagine they would function much like a 4 shot black powder rifle or something
---
Laser muskets are I the Dec room people have already stolen and distributed them around on PC.
---
Captainoob on YouTube has a video on one
---
When was there not?
---
I think so
---
I said that in my post. Lol. It needs to just be in the drop pool though. I'd love to get a bloodied one
---
I always carry a rifle as a fun toy and they are viable for me. Period.  
---
Game doesn't need to have a meta (thus goes the term viable) as PvP will be practically non-existent in 6.30 hours. Period.  
---
Civil war roleplaying is fun as fuck. Period.  
---
Yelling RELOAD MEN, SEND THESE RED COATS BACK TO THEIR KING is fun as fuck. Period.  
---
Period.
---
Well minuteman general outfit and some 1776 stuff have been datamined to be Atomic Store esclusives and Musket is the only important weapon missing from 4, maybe they'll add in as a way to make people play some more before Wastelanders?
---
Might be camp location also. I have much more foot traffic in the Savage divide. Fusion cells are my 3rd most popular ammo. 5.56 .45 and then fusion.
---
It being a "fun toy" doesn't make it viable. You can't practically main a black powder rifle through the game. Try running through whitesprings golf club, big bend tunnel, glassed cavern, west tek, the SBQ fight, the Imposter fight, the vault raids, or any other highly populated area using it as your main. Fun to RP maybe but still not viable as I said.
---
Step 6: At robot vendors use a grape mentats or day tripper to boost charisma. Some ghouls drop 2 of several kinds of drugs, so you should accumulate lots of these. Sell water, food, junk anything you don't need at the moment. Can sometimes get the 1400 daily caps in 5 minutes lol and look for other ways like selling stuff in vending machine.
---
Also some outfits and legendary armor have charisma boost. And there's a perk in charisma you can share...
---
Step 8: If you can fit fortune finder, 1 point in luck helps find caps stashes. And caps collector up to 3 points luck you'll find lots more in stashes. Maybe more what you're looking for to just find extra.
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è wow. Just wow.
---
Maybe they'll add it to the atom shop...
---
I disagree - the whole 'idea' of Hazmat suit is to give the ultimate radiation resistance with cost of almost no defense. If they'd allow wear armor under it will be OP. My second character, stealth shooter doesn't have a PA at all and Hazmat suit works pretty well, both for Whitespring and SBQ fights.
---
I bought the red fire place from the atom shop and it didnt unlock
---
If I had that helmet, I'd keep it. Only 32 sold and probably many of them returned to manufacturer = rare collection piece (some day)
---
No dude, you‚Äôre not just the messenger, you‚Äôre the guy that created this video and you‚Äôre trying to get people to watch it. And quite frankly, it‚Äôs pathetic.
---
How about instead of 1000 rad resist, you get something lower than that if you decide to put armor on underneath? Maybe -X on how many pieces of armor you have on underneath?
---
I got the Emergency Protocols ultracite plan yesterday, so the answer for those is yes, can't speak to the other plan as I don't have ultracite PA to check.
---
It is some idea, but knowing Bethesda lazy coding it'll be broken some way or another. I'd leave it as it is now - being defenseless adding additional thrill to the game, which is kind of fun ;)
---
Awesome. Good to know they do actually drop haha
---
dude I'd be so mad. I've been defending Invader knife as an ethical cosmetic skin but if they add the Musket I'd really be angry :(
---
They should have made the invader a skin. It's a skin for the combat knife that can't be applied to combat knives and isn't in the legendary pool so its useless.
---
I know not everyone likes Power Armor, I believe there were people who hated how it was done in Fallout 4. Besides strength and no fall damage, Power Armor had great rad resist on top of that. This post was to appeal essentially, to that crowd. You have a chance to get that rad resist, but not be Spongebob in terms of squishyness. It gives you more choices, something I like in video games
---
Right on.
---
Yeah I'll give you that, they are only novelty items at this point (maybe quad rifle with a proper build could work?), but I still don't understand why you chose to bash those lol, you could praise Muskets without bashing BP weapons :(
---
So you're happy on doubling down on something thats wrong with the game?
---
yeah some lads were talking trash about how it is an inferior combat knife as you can't apply stealth blade if you roll a nice 3\* knife and decide to go with Invader skin
---
Because the black powder rifle is a musket that isn't very viable and I'm asking for the laser musket that I believe is fairly viable. I didn't think anyone would care that I threw a little shade at them.
---
I imagine the guy who had to fix the power armor glitch has nightmares about all the reasons why not. That code must be a mess.
---
You guys are heroes.
---
It's not that I don't like PA - quite opposite - my main is PA heavy gunner, I love my full Strangler Heart set and X-02 (X-01 with paint) Power Armors combined with BE guns, but other character is stealth sniper and it's made to utilize completely different playstyle. And that's why I use Hazmat suit - it trades excellent radiation resistance for being one-hit glass cannon in nuke zones.
---
Yep. If a weapon can't be legendary then it's not getting used by most people. You don't see people using Tendorizors except at the event and you never saw people using bear arms, sheepsquatch clubs are even the fixer much until they were added to the legendary pool.
---
Fred! What the hell are you doing out here fred! If you're real you better tell me!
---
fair enough man I know I'm over-sensitive when it comes to historical weapons... RP'ing as a mentally ill lad who's stuck in the past is really fun sometimes ü§î I wish they could add a single Legion armor to the game lol.
---
I'm on Xbox, but my camp is pretty simple. I wouldn't be surprised if someone else built a similar one
---
I'm on Xbox
---
I'd like to see a version of nuclear winter with only black powder pistols from small boxes, black powder rifles from medium boxes, and The Dragon from large boxes.
---
You broke it into two words but I knew you meant underoos (as I call them) and not actual armor pieces.
---
Must be a popular look lol
---
Nah this isn't true. All dodgy does is remove 30% of incoming damage at the cost of your AP, the more AP you have the better it woks, also using quantums to replenish AP helps. Been testing builds in Pvp recently and there are a lot people who don't realise about how things work. Better to team up and play around to get a better understanding of it all. High dr helps, as it doesn't seem to be capped where as damage is and FFR is King.
---
What about shoulder pets ?
---
Like a baby scorched bat ?
---
Mini deathclaw ?
---
Thoes frogs that are blue?
---
Met cj Martin once a while back before player vendors were a thing , bought a ton of stimpacks really cheap as he and his flock mass produced them.
---
Stayed for a while at his "hospital" listening to him preach to whoever was there. Really nice bloke who took his role playing to the next level, enjoyed every minute of it.
---
Kept meaning to add him to my friends list but forgot his psn lol
---
nothing, all are static spawns in the asylum.
---
Its just so fucking boring. It was sold as a 'fun cook-out for the server!' but it's not. It's not fun. Where's the cook-out part? After the event is done, and we've squashed all the squirrels and collected the greens and banged tunelessly on the drums, what then? Wheres the fucking PARTY?! And there's only so many blood stained chef hats I can carry, how about some more unique plans, or Grahm cooking us unique food perhaps to take away? Fuck a duck.
---
Is this b8?
---
have you ever agreed with someone, but didn't want to say so out loud because they were being a total ass about it?
---
If your on xbox then feel free to join us, test your build and go hit the "best" players. Or people who think there the best.
---
who would‚Äôve thought an online game would have an economy and not everything would be worth less than 1k caps.
---
You never need atomic shop item.
---
Love is in the rad.
---
Thanks mate but Im looking forward to obtaining it all and crafting. Thx again
---
It's a legitimate question tho' when you start seeing what some people are wearing (or not!) while getting around the place. Lol.
---
you prefer to have to do a standard or expert raid run instead of a simple picture?  Photos are freacking easy.
---
I've got a couple plans and a tenderizer but yea the rewards are junk. I've been just solo'ing all the events for scrip honestly. They are kinda boring and can use alot of ammo if your farming them.
---
This is adorable! This video made my day.
---
Plasma and laser weapons need a durability buff really bad it‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
I only use energy weapons and it is horrendous.
---
Gauss rifle is in a good place could do with a little durability buff... maybe.
---
I carry enough weapons to equip a full squad because of this 4 x lasers 4 x plasma 1 x gauss,
---
What I really need is Veronica from New Vegas so I have a portable work bench... I would pay ATOMS for that and bring back the poplar hood.
---
I gotcha. How does one not be an ass about this? What‚Äôs your take?
---
How cute &lt;3
---
*pew pew*
---
Should simply cut them off from Power deactivate them?
---
Nice job! I'm still missing one..Energy Weapons. I've been looking for weeks!
---
on another note;  
---
HOW TO FARM CAPS FELLERS??
---
Put them in a room, when you are near max just disconnecte them and lock the door
---
This is correct. 
---
I will note that there are times when this process doesn‚Äôt want to work (PS4) for some reason.  I have to quit/restart to fix it.  Just letting OP know in case it doesn‚Äôt work the first time.
---
That happens to me too. It's a bug caused by unyielding and overweight: Unyielding pump up your strength make you carry more but the armor perk stop working when you die.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs the principle yo
---
Your English gives away that you are fucking 9 years old. Jesus.
---
Yes the Vault-Tec Bed 2
---
Good to know. I used to just turn off the power but if that's the case, I'll start to phisically remove the vending machine from now on
---
Looks like there's two of the same in the middle row but still great job finding all of them
---
Absolutely not worth $40. You can find the game $10-20 from cdkey sites. Bought my mule account for 8.
---
Unless you've hit a bug, only the low level ones in the Forest should disappear/flee completely (same as Mothman), the rest do teleport a bit, but reappear to attack.
---
A Vampire minigun is worth more than a 1000 Caps, a Instigating Minigun is junk that I won't even put in my stash, straight to scrip.
---
Now, people who sell stuff for over 10k? I don't get that, but some people have the need to be "really good" at the game and are willing to pay it. 
---
Hell there are items on sale for more than the max caps a player can have in private sales.
---
There are 5 power armor frames in/around Watoga that can accessed in minutes.  I have farmed that route and scrapped so many T-series pieces.  Have you done that route for looking for frame items?
---
Consider this .. some of these people are being paid by Bethesda competition to smear and shit on this game. They get sweet loot for being lying cunts. This is the new wave of internet marketing/advertising. It's dirty. It's rotten. It's here to stay.
---
Over priced Serums? I frequent see them going for 300, not even close to overpriced.
---
Thats to stop you buying them and immediately taking them to a Robo Vendor for profit.
---
Not all B2525 handmades are duped - my friend looted one by himself. It's not a legacy, so in theory you can get it from next 3\* enemy you'll kill.
---
Gz dude! I just need 4 more but didnt search for them yet
---
Nah it stacks as long as you have ap for it
---
I just place them in an area with 3 walls back and 2 sides then disconnect the generator and put the front wall up when I dont want to sell anything that way you dont have to store them and restock
---
I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs a timing issue. Sometimes I go too fast, press the key to drink and it makes noises but there‚Äôs no water flow out of the pump. Spamming collect at that point doesn‚Äôt work. I give it a few seconds and start over. Never had to quit the game to make it work (XB1)
---
That's awesome! And I dig the Mothman shrine.
---
Only time it's a problem for me is when I'm exploring a building and think it's a regular door then bam! I have to load outside then load back in
---
I mainly sell plans and they are 50 caps or less...
---
2-3 months ago they were still selling for around 1000 .)
---
Bloody, Explosive, 25% ffr
---
Wait, you guys are making sales?
---
What's the outfit on the left when you're on the exercise bikes?
---
I too finally found them all. I think the last one I needed was leader. I'm still trying to collect the full set of magazines...
---
Big thumbs up!
---
it's very easy to make 1.4k caps per day just by selling things to vendor NPCs, do you actually think there isnt any item in the game that is worth a single day of caps (or like 5 minutes in a single day, because that's how long it takes to empty the vendor caps)?
---
I have mine in a building in case I ever need to deactivate them, I just board them up.
---
**Bug?**: It is difficult to verify, but when the meat bar gets fully filled, it sometimes drops below full for a couple of 100s of milliseconds right after as the event completion update plays. In this case, it appears the rewards are given as if we achieved the 2nd tier only. I've read that a full meat bar no longer guarantees a 1\* armor unlike the first time in my experience, but this lack of 1\* armor reward could be actually the result of this anomaly I described.
---
**Bug:** Grahm stirs the air and various other Grahm/Chally related animation glitches. [Plays exactly like the last time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZs22MWBE6A&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
**QoL**: The Tenderizer, especially modded, is too heavy (20lbs -&gt; 34lbs). I'm no melee so stashing it for "different times" would waste 4.25% of my stash.
---
**QoL**: The at hour:00 Primal Cut event overlaps with the Grahm event, so it is most likely wasted.
---
**QoL**: Can't turn in only 1..4 Prime meats. I can't remember the first time but now, partial event completion yields partial meat counts.
---
**Consistency/QoL**: I think the Prime Cut event in the Ash Heap always has a 1\* Sheepsquatch while other events have only a regular chance for a 1\*. It would be great if all cut locations would spawn a guaranteed legendary (and spawn less regular to account for the 50% more time to kill it).
---
**QoL**: Drums and power armor. Yes, there is no lockup risk to exit the PA anymore, but the enter/exit animation takes way too long. For example, drawing out the beasts needs drumming for a few seconds and takes like 3-4 seconds for the exit animation to play and then another few seconds to reenter the PA. I have zero resistances barefoot and got damaged to near death a couple of times by rushing enemies during this time window. Suggestion: meleeing the drum a couple of times should also count.
---
**Other**: CAMPs near event locations are considered by some as disruptions and inconveniences (several posts on Reddit). I personally had not encountered them so I have no opinion.
---
I guess you meant "respawn" and not "respond"?
---
But to answer the question, world object respawn after 20 hrs of after you picked up 120-180 other world objects, whichever is faster. Same goes for containers.
---
Good luck karma from Moose I guess. 
---
The Watoga  route is still good for other frames, junk, fusion cores, bobbleheads, and magazines. After you‚Äôve done the Mayor for a Day quest the robots are not aggressive to you.
---
I am level 470 and the one who tried it on was level 80 with a level 92 lurking in the background just waiting for me to retaliate, I do have passive mode on that is how I knew they were trying to be silly buggers as I was dealing with the vendor at Watoga station and then someone opened up on me from behind with a TSE, so I just walked up to him right in his face and when he backed off I did it again, just to piss him off then gave him the angry emote and walked off, pratt
---
If you don't like it, just don't shop there. Personally I don't buy legendaries...never have and never will. I take my chances with RNG...which has fucked me over multiple times so I should be due for a good legendary soon. I don't mind someone trying to make some caps in game...what I mind is d-bag dupers who sell this stuff for real world cash...those are the pricks you need to be pissed off at.
---
I believe some chems have longer durations that are set to 90 seconds. 
---
Since I can't fully answer your question, In Nuclear Winter - Bobble Heads will not stack and will cancel the other stat boost received from the last Bobble Head. The same happens when you pick up a new Comic Magazine stat boost/ability, it will cancel the other Comic buff.
---
Hey guess what, there actually IS an under armour that can be worn in PA. Not legendary armour, under armour, and yes all the stats stack with the power armour ;-) And no I won't tell you which one, have fun working it out.
---
Uh...unless they changed something, Atomic Shop items can't be placed in someone else's camp. I tried placing some plants at my friends camp and it didn't work.
---
But one of the issues with the crafting (excluding the risk of loosing all your kit in a raid) is that its  only for PA.
---
For those of us who don‚Äôt use PA, what is the point of it..
---
I agree with the other points about being able to craft / modify legendary‚Äôs would be really cool and more beneficial than anything else..but it would kind of negate the need for the purveyor if you could just mod them..
---
flashlight on the weapon would be nice
---
I have mine behind a powered door
---
Flip the switch, my machines ‚Äúturn off‚Äù and the door closes
---
No-one can access it
---
Maybe the icon changes colour upon visit to white or grey. I have had the same problem, multiple visits and caps get spent so quickly.
---
You‚Äôd change your mind the second you zone inside my box of death.
---
Do you have vendors? Maybe they didn't like the prices.
---
Why is it all the roleplayers aren't on PC :/
---
Here‚Äôs the thing, a fridge and a robot that collects stuff for you don‚Äôt give you an advantage because you are not directly competing against people for any sort of rank. You can get atoms with hardly any effort and spend a tiny bit more time getting the item rather than pay. 
---
Food and drink storing for a little while longer isn‚Äôt even an advantage since the ingredients for food are so easy to farm and they need to travel to their own camp to grab them. And just take over a junkyard or place your base by a junk location. 
---
If the game was centered around pvp and/or it had an actual impact on anything in game then it might be considered p2w if someone downing a drink or a steak actually made it so they would win. Maybe then that extra 50% shelf life of that Death Claw steak might mean something. 
---
This however is not the case and until it is, it‚Äôs not pay to win by any means since other players having some extra junk or their soup lasting a little longer in a fridge doesn‚Äôt affect you in any way.
---
I finally got the Tenderizer this last time round...about damn time. Now I just need one of the mods and the recipes. I have everything else.
---
I remember one of the event reward you with a supply drop and it contain 100 pre war money
---
Maybe i should pop a chem check effects and pop different chem and check again.
---
Iron fist is the only one of its perk, there isnt 3 different ones like, slugger/rifleman etc. Thats why you have to use the two mutations to get melee damage and unarmed damage increase instead.
---
This, often people dont like overprized items.
---
They're removing survival? Well fuck, that's the mode that made me wanna purchase. Is it really that unpopular?
---
Now go clean up Camden Park. You‚Äôll have cloth for weeks!
---
Known bug, put them on a mat, blueprint and put the blueprint inside, then you can remove the mat.
---
I liked it, way more than adventure.
---
But too many PvP players preferred adventure. They didn‚Äôt want to lose their aid üòí
---
I think that's the Responders one at the airport, forget the name...
---
&gt; Oh shut up. *[...]*  never ever has silencing anyone contributed to anything contructive
---
No fucking comment.
---
&gt; Why don't we have a vote and get them rules sorted? 
---
Do it if you want to.  'till then that's the rule. Break it if you want but don't whine if you get into trouble.
---
As others have said. Best way is to put them behind a lockable door. Sucks if that means you need to re do your camp setup though. 
---
I put mine in the greenhouse so I can lock the door when max caps. I also put a stay away sign in front of the door so even if someone picks the lock, they can‚Äôt get through the door way.
---
Yep, those two parks are great for cloth.
---
There's nothing left to do. We have all the items and plans, most of us anyway.
---
If your camp is not in the middle of crowded areas all you have to do is to remove wire connecting vendor with electricity - it'll be removed from map as visible vendor.
---
Well, tato salad is a unique food and the plan is exclusive to the event
---
people are in this sub cause they play the game?? What did you expect? Of course people are gonna defend/support something they like
---
Oh...you forgot the toilet paper in the outhouses, too!
---
That is a better idea, change color like. When u join a server all the vendor are the same color, when u visit  one it changes color to show that u have been there, then maybe it changes back to original color when say the player adds something new to the vending machine. I really hope bethesda reads this one u hit gold my friend.
---
Frankly, me and my friends were only doing the hunt part in the Ash Heap for the cave crickets, those were worth more than a mere 15 scrips from the cookout.
---
I only put ammo in as filler, and at zero caps.
---
Actually there isn't any. You might be thinking of the racetrack nearby, it has TP in the outhouses.
---
Really? How do I redeem my $30 from my 3000 atoms?
---
Ya, you are right that's the one
---
Wet kitty mode? Sounds great!
---
they dont apply to everything because why sell a skin for all of the guns when you can charge the same amount for one specific skin at a time!
---
seriously this is why.
---
from a business point of view this is double dipping, its a good money maker but very scummy.
---
People would stop asking for it to trade and would have to resort back to using caps more often. It would help
---
How would this work lore-wise? The Minutemen invented the laser musket and they won't be around for decades
---
Im not reading all that you asked for proof I gave it to you admit you were wrong.
---
All except the greenhouse for some reason
---
How to post photos? Noob question I know but how? This form don't ever let me post anything and when I do it gets taken down, any help would mean alot.
---
I make sales all the time and I'm no where near whitesprings. I have a scorchbeast for a neighbor (thought shoppers are safe from him). But I make sales because I carry stuff worth buying at prices worth paying.
---
Xbox
---
I may be wrong but for me I just look if it says ‚Äúdoor‚Äù. If it says door, it‚Äôll open regularly but if it says something else it normally goes to a load screen. But I‚Äôve done that a lot lol
---
I myself don't use PA either, but I'm always trying to be on top of the changes in competetive parameters of this game. Like it or not (I don't), this PA set has obsoleted all previous armors, effectively rendering all legendary armor 2nd tier gear. The whole counters and balance system now desperately cries either for a nerf to this PA, or a step up in the other types of gear, and I favour the latter path.
---
I think purveyor should be the interface you need to use to obtain the legendary mod and their point doesn't have to be negated. In Diablo 3, a game oriented solely about tiny tweaking your character, you could reroll everything, but this rerolling was smartly limited. An example on how this could be handled: to produce single explosive legendary mod, you would need to sacrifice 5 weapons that are legendary-explosive.
---
Right now, when you loot from purveyor, its either a jackpot, a something that elevates your trading position, or a scrip source. The system I propose adds additional type of division on how do you rate legendaries: as potential 20% of legendary mod you are working towards. This makes even some shitty rolls desired for crafting purposes.
---
Best solution!
---
Now I must go investigate. I would swear there was a bunch of TP at Tyler Park.
---
Collision Course
---
Same. Use a switch inside the reactor room, which has a locked door, and the line leading from there connects only to my vending machines and the door. Switch it off (manually or from my terminal, which is also locked), the vending machines stop broadcasting and the door closes. Great way to control the use of the vendors when you don't want them accessed.
---
Who gives a flying fuck about you? I sure don't.
---
At what point did I defend them? The only thing I said was that I, as a customer, do not want a rushed product but rather a function quality product. How is that defending them?
---
Yeah I agree it is scummy. Thanks for the comment
---
I can't count how many times I've went to the crafting station only to realize I'm in my drawers with a Fasnacht owl mask on ,and have no idea how long I've been like that.
---
People on this game are mostly cool. Like I needed an antibiotics blueprint (that you can buy in the Whitespring bunker) but couldn't get it. I asked someone if he could help me and told him I would pay double the price of the blueprint. He came and gave it to me for free, I was so touched.
---
Also one time i was visiting player's vending machines and someone saw i was low level and gave me some gear to sell/scrap (I had literally no ammo, new player, whatever you want, i was in deep sh!t !) The game may have issues, but players make it feel way better.
---
Captains, i salute all of you.
---
I upload the photos on Imgur and then I post the link at the beginnig of the post
---
Just disconnect them from power.
---
Great place. I've had 200 cloth from there before. There's also a bunch of soft toys around, napkins in the halloween party building, and money in the cash registers.
---
i believe they fixed this one
---
Finally someone dropped some help, Thank you so much. If you ever on PS4 we should play bro.
---
Let me know how it goes, i would like to know as well. I'm stuck at work.
---
Man, and I thought *I* was bad at negotiating. Murdering my brahmin is not getting you a discount, you're just getting blocked.
---
(Also, if you happen to see me in-game and wanna negotiate on prices, feel free to message me!)
---
No they wouldn't. They would just ask for different weapons or rare armors. Caps don't have a real use in the game and that's why people don't trade God tier items for them.
---
No problem man. I unfortunately play on Xbox, so unless they ever put the crossplatform I won't be able to play with you
---
That only. Stops it showing on the map it doesnt stop players buying from them
---
That would be the dream of online gaming once all console's becomes cross play.
---
It was fun the first week it showed up. Something new and unique to try out. But bringing it back so soon was a mistake. Couple that with the fact that the better rewards appear to have been made less frequent (I've gotten the Grillmaster's Hat at least half the times I've participated) and I'm just bored with it.
---
It should have been modified in some way to feel fresh, and event rewards shouldn't have been scaled back (if they were; I could be mistaken). We put in a lot of effort to "earn" the return of Meat Week, but it doesn't feel like the effort was worth it.
---
being able to change pip boy light colors world be great.
---
  in the meantime you can use a mining helmet though and get the same options PA have.  sucks though if you have a mask that does not agree with the hat.
---
I just brought my first console last year.i had the intention me and my kids would play fallout together,but so far it's just me.it gives us other things to relate to and sometimes my youngest son helps me get past that hard parts
---
Ok... you are correct. It must have been the racetrack.
---
Caps don't have any use because of shit being duped to high hell, sold for caps, and now everyone just wants to trade for God tier shit. You're not gonna change my mind in this
---
If you wear a mining helmet, then the lamp on those replaces the Pip-Boy light, and the color can be changed at armor workbenches.
---
Let's hope in some near future
---
This game has already broken the lore and time line more than once so that doesn't really matter at this point. They could even just write something in a terminal about a responder inventing it and then say that the minutemen found one and reverse engineered it.
---
That's because eyeglasses are for nerds!!!!!!!! /s
---
Not trying to change your mind. Legacies wont get removed and you'll never be right so that's all that matters.
---
For what it's worth - it's in the game for workshops.   I don't see a good reason it can't be in camps. I mean, sure, you could set up a death trap, but it's lot like death is that consequential in the game.
---
Probably coming soon to the atom shop lol
---
Lol, you can think I'm wrong and I'll just think you're wrong. Whatever
---
Spike armor and cage armor
---
Yeah man, I just played for like 2 days and got everything, went back to borderlands 3 and am now waiting not so patiently for shadowkeep to drop
---
Only difference is Bethesda must agree with me or they would do what you are saying.
---
They definitely do not want to set the world on fire...unlike me.
---
Again, I'm gonna continue thinking you're wrong. Move along.
---
Oh yeah if I stopped to read it wouldn't be a problem haha it's a minor inconvenience more than anything
---
It changes every DLC-season, so with some luck we are just a month or two away from a new one now.
---
It doesn't bother me much, I started murdering my Brahmin and repairing it over and over again in front of one dude who killed my Brahmin in front of me. Tbh I'm surprised killing an owned Brahmin doesn't make you wanted though.
---
Yes, it will.
---
Welp. Pretty sad if these two are unable to get through a fucking silo themselves.
---
I understand lmao I‚Äôve literally read doors that said ‚ÄòAppalachia‚Äô then just clicked it anyways. I think I might be an idiot but it‚Äôs okay.
---
I can genuinely recommend a medic build based around a flamer. The friendly fire perk is actually quite good for healing teammates, along with field surgeon and team medic. Quack surgeon, dry nurse etc are all seriously helpful.
---
I had a vampires faster fire rate reduced weight flamer until recently. Amazing weapon. The fuel is kinda heavy but if you farm for a while it's not too bad. Steel, oil, acid. I had around 10,000
---
cant :( too hard to finish the quest so i can start getting badges
---
I like the sound of the trading in idea...
---
I know, I'm just ranting. And greedy, I'm also greedy.
---
You need to learn the vanilla cooking stoves before you can build the red ones, afaik.
---
I know, but I don't want to wear a mining helmet üòÅ
---
I'd buy it üëç
---
yeah I like making shielded wet suit and baseball bats for new players as the bat will get them through the early game and the under armor never goes out of style with level and that +2str +2end +1 perception is super helpful early game
---
I only put plans in my vendor and they're all free. Don't even bother selling ammo, I just dump it outside Vault 76.
---
üòÇüëç
---
As a hazmat user over PA I disagree. Keeping our under amour on would be nice but that would also be nice for PA users. 
---
I would like to see mods added to the hazmat suit. Just one slot. Able to hold similar mods as a chest piece.
---
Recruitment drive. Be sure you return the favor by joining the right faction when Wastelanders comes out.
---
I hope theirs a Halloween one, and a Halloween event
---
I like the idea, until I'm being chased by 15 ghouls who want my forks and plastic pumpkins and I dive for a door.
---
Yes the plans are tradable, but since it's not an Atomic Shop item you could just get a friend that has it learned already to build one in your camp if you can't find someone selling the plan.
---
I don't like the idea as in the lore the light comes from the screen meaning the colour of the screen would need to change otherwise it would be lore breaking.
---
Working fine for me.  One disconnect in the last month.
---
Let me kill you.
---
The strangler power armor isn't worth how much Vault 94 sucks and it's barely even possible to obtain for solo melee players.
---
&gt; got out of passive
---
You don't need that.  The person killing you needs to get out of passive, though.  (I keep forgetting to do that).
---
Passive *only* affects *outgoing* damage, not *incoming*.
---
Take a workshop. PvP will come for you.
---
&gt; He seems to have a major hate boner for 76. I swear he only still plays because his hate gets him clicks. 
---
That's about as unrepresentative of Juicehead as the thing being complained about in the OP.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm hardly a cheerleader for the guy but he's been pretty fair after the initial few months of 76 content. He and MrMatty about the fairest people when it comes to 76 new coverage. 
---
Just because there are negative things to cover, doesn't make them haters. Very different to the youtubers that OP is referring to.
---
Odd, I have plenty of traffic, located at the lumbermill just south of 76:
---
https://youtu.be/LCZ9toQZTV8
---
It doesn't stack and it's 1,5min (overdrive, psycho...) up to 3min (buffats)
---
Oh.  I thought they had to be powered up.
---
It IS serious for some people, why is that so hard to comprehend?
---
Say you're into cars and some cunt nicks the paint, but that's OK, it's not serious to him? You'd be OK with that?
---
Easy fix: have it work only for the CAMP owner.
---
I hope not - it's only one day and if we'll have months to see this at the start I'm against.
---
PvE - not worth it. PvP - it obsoletes every prior legendary and puts all other armor items in 2nd tier.
---
But the fact how its not suited for lone players is actually in favor of enabling them to work on their character with more appropriate means. Discussion in other line have given me an idea of exchanging 5 items with some legendary mods for one craftable legendary mod with appropriate trait. This way if you get something useless, but explosive, it would be 20% of your work towards exchanging legendary trait of your weapon for explosive.
---
This would further stimulate the economy as now weapons that are 2/3 godrolled (i.e. bloodied, bashing damage, VATS AP cost -25% the fixer would be worth something decent simply because it'd be easier to turn it into BE25 than it would be to craft it from scratch.
---
Try unarmed melee.  Once you hit the end game and convert them to a bloodied build the damage is insane.
---
Some will say tinfoil hat, but it‚Äôs true.
---
You're not sure why it would be OP? Really? Haha, ok then.
---
No, it won't.
---
what else would you like tailor-made, your highness
---
Congrats mate!
---
It‚Äôs only a problem when I‚Äôm in PA at a scrapping station and can‚Äôt remember what I was wearing before putting the PA on
---
Omg that video was great!! Absolutely amazing üòç you guys are gorgeous üíôüíõ congrats, and great job Bethesda those cards are OP
---
I am currently trying out heavy explosives build (power armor) with focus on suppression and staggering, for crowd control and support. Lots of area damage, lots of damage reduction and keeping enemies from attacking. Kinda fun when playing in a group, but slower than a direct damage build when soloing.
---
We probably wont get a durability buff for legacy weapons any time soon but it is fairly easy to repair.
---
If you need some sort of buff I would recommend the 'luck of the draw' perk which has a chance to slightly repair your weapon.
---
Mole rats and radroaches. They do not deal much damage, and there is a fair chance of contracting something from the diseased variants. Also, if you do not have that effect already, use RadAway first to reduce resistance to diseases by 50%.
---
You can still buy from the machines though. Cutting power only removes the vendor icon from the map
---
Birdman is!
---
I know who that is, but i don't get the reference, could you explain plz?
---
None of us are having fun or even bothering to figure it out. Just tell us instead of being a dick about it.
---
Hold up! What hat is that?
---
Leader Bobbleheads has eluded me for months now last one I need and like 2 magazines to have them all
---
Just remove the power running to it
---
One time a level 256 guy dropped the Dragon legendary weapon infront of me then left I was level 51 at the time was really happy and gratefull
---
Best solution is for them to grey out sales of anything that would put you over the cap limit.
---
Keep thinking so pale. Doesn't change that legacies are here to stay and that's what matters here.
---
Yeah yeah, move along "pale"
---
Congrats
---
You get an entire Power Armor Raider Set from Rose after finishing her quest. I gave mine to another player too. But since its level requirements are so high for what it actually gives you. I guess he just scapped it.
---
you can have my hole PA also  it with the nuka cola paint, GT is same as here. hit me up I will get on later after work.
---
Except that nicking the paint costs hundreds of dollars. Video games have zero affect on real life and that's why I say it's just a game and don't take it so serious. Car damage and someone stealing a 15 to 20 minute nuke launch in a video game arent comparable.
---
So new chem will replace the effects of one taken before?
---
Thanks for sharing, I'm always farming junk,will add this to my stops.
---
Auto correct on the "pale" so you got me with that sick burn. Have a good one and enjoy playing fo76 with legacies in the game, I know I will.
---
I just found it amusing, have a "good" day being wrong asshat ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Good riddance, hope that weekly slot goes to something that can earn you atoms.
---
If I'm wrong then I'd love to know why they are in the game.
---
There is a discord for F76 roleplayers, but I don't have the link right now (at work), but if you look around you should be able to find it. They run factions, backstories and everything.
---
You're still here? Go away, I don't like you
---
The Meat Week rerun was intended only as a  stop-gap event, until Wastelanders is released. Bethesda took the easy route by recycling a previous event (as they already had the code, therefore they didn't have to actually put forth any effort into creating something new), and promoted it as though the community was  responsible to "unlock" it, for it to even occur. That's all marketing bs; it was always going to be a scheduled event, regardless of players interaction (does anyone _seriously_ believe that over half a million Scorchbeasts were killed so as  to trigger the event? Lol). 
---
If Bethesda could convince players that their actions had contributed to advancing the direction of the game, then those players would also believe that their continued presence is what would make the game great, so they would stay and perhaps recruit others to try it, too. Throw in a few Atom Shop freebies, and you seal the deal.
---
I like the game as it is, but I don't need the duplicitous act of blowing smoke up our asses, pretending that such events are somehow the results of player participation, especially when they're just reruns anyway. I mean, what was Bethesda going to do without the release of Meat Week, Vol 2? Media does this sort of thing all the time, recycling old articles when they've no new material and just need "filler". Sure, you'll always have some who may have missed it the first time around, but the majority will not like the redundancy. I'm also sure many of us noticed that the only thing "new" about this installment of Meat Week #2, had been the free Atom Shop items. Oh yes...the Atom Shop itself is never left stagnant, but they'll be sure to give us a Meat Week #3, if they feel they can get away with it, and then try to pass it off as if we all made such a _glorious occasion_ even possible!
---
If they were just honest up front that they didn't have squat for a new event, I could appreciate that more, rather than being fed that this bogus event was "unlocked" by the community.
---
Yea a reward for a global event is to bring back an event that ended frankly not that bloody long ago with another reward to extend said event that ended not that long ago with no changes is soo stupid and plain lazy. At this point a new hat would of been a better reward
---
Lmao. The irony.
---
Looks very good and you are of course right about blocker and the 200% thing! Thank you
---
Hey man you're the one who responded as if you were done so I did too ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è go away now
---
Okay. XD
---
Oooooh fireproof. Right. Forgot about that, thank you!
---
Why did I read this as ‚ÄúDoes anyone else miss the old  LUNCH menu‚Äù?
---
It's there, but it's a very rare spawn. What platform are you?
---
Or wear a hazmat.
---
Sometimes upon logging in from a previous disconnect, you have time to equip a hazmat suit. I have one on my favorites wheel for just that purpose.
---
I seriously doubt you have anything I'm looking for.
---
Pc
---
Sounds like Ultima Online, back in the day.
---
So don't waste you time server hopping - come to me and I modify your chest with that mod - it's only 500 caps with my mats. 
---
I'll be home in 5,5 hours, IGN Baronik (it's one of many services I do for a long time, has more than 830 trade karma on biggest Fallout 76 market subreddit), so you don't risk anything ;)
---
Pip boy light mods....? I got sick of wearing my bright nodded mining helmet..
---
Maybe a crown with a glowing diamond?
---
Were ALL* of the flashlights destroyed in the war...? maybe the "lore" is a bit unbelievable....?
---
Thx for the offer but i want actual mod plan because i might want to mid other armor in future and it won't be able to play next 1hour :/
---
With video evidence
---
Oh, so good luck server hopping ;)
---
if you're on pc it's pretty trivial to change the pipboy color to whatever you prefer in Fallout76Prefs:
---
fPipboyEffectColorB=0.2600
---
fPipboyEffectColorG=0.7000
---
fPipboyEffectColorR=1.0000
---
is amber like NV
---
No, if you read my comment you would see that the light comes from the pipboy screen. The screen is green which is why the light is green. You would need a red, blue, yellow, pink etc, screen for the pipboy which is lore breaking and ugly
---
google it my friend
---
So you might have just been on a laggy server. I probably server hopped 15 times yesterday to get plans from Graham and at least three of those servers were noticeably laggy.
---
Also the main reason to do the meat week stuff is the prime meat which is a reward for the events you can turn in and it gives you legendary scrip.  So if you do it right you can turn in up to 15 Prime meat pieces for 15 scrip at each meet week event and this isn't affected by the 150 daily limit.
---
In other words don't eat the prime meat , you should be turning it in at the meet week event which not only helps make that successful but gives you scrip.
---
All long time players are searching for some sort of endgame. Many turned to survival because adventure mode got boring with repetitive content being added. 
---
With the announcement survival mode being scrapped many players turned back to griefing in adventure mode.
---
Many of you take an arrogant attitude towards PvP based modes when in reality you should have been thankful that they existed at all.
---
To be clear you can use diff√©rent chem at the same time. The same chem can't be stack. It refreshes only the duration remaining. 
---
But you can combined same effects, psycho+overdrive will give you +50% damage bonus for 1,5 min. Insane. 
---
However Bobbleheads can be stack. If you find 2*Heavy gunner it will be +40% damage bonus not only 20%
---
Same I‚Äôm playing for xp but it‚Äôs difficult alone, anyone got PS4 wanna play tonight?
---
The news sites got it wrong first. Also this subreddit seems to hate youtubers a lot.
---
Or at least fix the keypad switch. As some A hat showed me, I had turned off my vendors because I hadn't have a chance to mule caps over at the time so he turned them back on and bought a few 100 caps worth which I lost as I was at cap limit then he threw me the vomit emote and jumped servers.
---
Fasnacht is the same as Mardi Gras, it would not make sense to have it at other times of the year.  It would be like doing Easter now.  I'm sure there will be more Fasnacht; next year it's in February.
---
Vendor bit phoenix has it. The BoS vendor in wagona. But it is a very rare thing for him to have, you have to keep server hopping
---
Somehow I doubt this.
---
On console they are cheap duped but on pc those legacies trade for alot of value not even caps anymore.
---
Scorchbeast attack?
---
Doesn't stop them selling
---
I still doing it 60times already lol
---
Could be. No other damage to the camp though and whose bag was that?
---
I miss the old lunch menu...
---
Your camp can still be destroyed by Ghouls, scorched, a mole rat, etc.
---
Maybe someone left a present. Was there a ‚Äúyou have been insulted‚Äù thingy inside?
---
Also great to pick up all that litter!
---
Very true and do understand that point but, the lord behind the event is controlled by the robots and could allow it to spawn or be available at any time. When you first visit Helvicia in the game there is a holotape in one of the buildings that gives some background to the festival and how the robots could change when and where the parade is held. I was just hoping that they would have given us this event in hopes to boost player envolvement.
---
Survival was incredibly fun when it was longest alive for the leaderboards
---
It died immediately when it became who can camp trainstation's the best
---
Camden Park's also pretty good for cloth.
---
Well you just think you're the smartest little bugger don't you? Your damn right their life must suck to message somebody vulgarities and when they are used back on them, they run and tattle like a 9 year old. "Lmao"
---
I preferred the music of the old one. It got me hyped to start my session for the day. This new foreboding music makes me feel like I'm going to have a bad time xD
---
Omg thanks
---
*Breaks Rules
---
*Gets Banned
---
*Pikachu Meme Face.
---
I can help with that
---
You know, I forgot they could change the date.  More events would be good in any case.  I really hope there's some kind of Oct. 27 / Halloween event coming up it would really be a shame to miss the first Halloween in a game world basically frozen at that time.
---
Please no, just no. The seating and playing with long key press is great but doors? No thank you. 
---
There is no deed for this as it clearly states when you are close to the door if it's simply a door (inside door of the house) or if it leads to somewhere else (this is when you get loading screen).
---
God you literally suck at shitposting. "Lmao"
---
What is the cap carry limit? How much?
---
Not a "shitpost" if it's true. üëç
---
I've seen those mole miners kill two afk traders and all their vendors outside whitesprings, with a little guidance of course.
---
So very true! I hope they add more events and especially seasonal events with Wastelanders. I love Fallout and hate to say, have been reaching a dull point thus switching up my build constantly just to keep trying new things and searching locations I seldom travel to. Just hope we get gigs of content with the dlc to come.
---
I don't think it would be OP. My non PA gear has almost the same ballistic protection as T51b PA, with more carry weight, SPECIAL bonuses etc etc from legendaries.
---
Having a 5 points of SPECIAL also available in PA and getting 10 points of added resistance is not OP in anyway.
---
unfortunatly i am a console peasent, so for me i need to go miner hardhat or green light.
---
And let me guess, pretty much everyone in the comment section was agreeing with him, while using the same old insults that have been used against the game since before launch. These people sound like a broken record
---

They are dead aren't they... ;___;
---
Someone might have used it.
---
What's the cap limit? I'm assuming its 10k.
---
328 KeRMa
---
No I shouldn't.
---
It seems like all the folks that think it would be OP are folks who are already OP and don‚Äôt want others catching up to them....
---
With how laggy it is on the current version, you probably are!
---
Sometimes when traveling to people's camps you spawn enemies, who can destroy camps. I always try to kill them and save the owner repairing, but some enemies can make real mess before you'll kill them.
---
Not all doors. Just main doors. Someday you'll agree.
---
Ill be there look for xjx speedy xjx
---
I understand what you say, but then it already breaks the lore that the light is in front and not left of you where the pipboy screen points to while you're holding a weapon.
---
What about adding a flashlight bulb to the pipboys right side, so that it points in front of the player while running? We could apply mods in the workbench and it wouldn't break any lore.
---
I've made a Medic/Power Armor/Heavy weapons guy. dude rolls around with X-01 first aid, born survivor and emergency protocols. and walking pharmacy. he has like 300 stimpacks on him, i could go afk for like 10mins with people attacking him and pretty sure i'd come back to him alive.
---
30k
---
It's a mining helmet
---
Thank you.
---
Lmao yeah cuz I don't spend every waking moment of the last month, 3 days on reddit. Keep trying all you want bud, you're just looking more and more like a goof ball üòÇüòÇ
---
Now modding pipboy I can get behind as it makes much more sense. Pipboy bulbs is a much better idea.
---
Can't believe that people are downvoting a fix fir a problem. Morons.
---
Correction. Month, 16 days.
---
Lol. You're the one who acted like I was a bad poster and you were amazing.
---
Where can I get that?
---
Keep farming them down votes bud
---
Dunno man, I don't remember where I found mine
---
people still waste time on this garbage?
---
Not gonna affect my karma "bud".
---
Really? Then what‚Äôs the point in running power to it? Just for the lights? Thanks, I didn‚Äôt know that‚úåüèº
---
That‚Äôs probably the case just a little surprised to find no sign of anyone/anything. The person who left the bag behind must have died at the same time as the attacker. I waited about 10 min to see if the bag owner would return for their junk (it was good junk)
---
Ah, thanks.
---
Just remove a cable?
---
Have been to the cemetery got the first round. Server hopped got locked safes but all empty. Several attempts later and a reload all I got was 15 Bobby pins lighter hehe. Anyone know of any where else to look. Thanks
---
You're a baby dude.
---
I had a few, clearly in a group, trying to bait players at a vendor camp loaded with rubbish weapons and costumes. One kept firing at me while the others waited. I hopped on the Mr Fuzzy ride until it drove them nuts.
---
Be nice if they added like a bank function to the machine itself. Any caps from purchase items goes into it and you have to access the machine to withdraw it.
---
There's a 50 Cal Machine Gun in a truck near a crashed vertibird at Hemlock Holes. Usually has ammo with it. Also one in a truck SE of Clarksburg. Just follow the road past the shooting range and you'll find it. The truck has sandbags around it so is easy to spot.
---
Exit the game completely, do it all from the main menu, if it doesn't go, restart again, if it doesn't ... well, try another day XD.
---
At least I do that.
---
Put them on a power switch
---
I just set the price to how it is on default, but when I started I had the prices at half the default price
---
Thanks. I should have added I tried this a few times but I‚Äôll try again.
---
Thanks. I should have added I tried doing this a few times but will try it again.
---
Also a better love story than Twilight.
---
Again, you take an arrogant attitude here, while I see the tearful posts from griefing victims increasing daily. 
---
Nothing wrong with not being into PvP. But why the distain for a game mode that didn‚Äôt affect you in any way?
---
Why not use the caps you get from the events to buy new ammo?
---
I want this so bad!! 
---
I thought of leaving treats in a brown paper bag at my camp with a sign but I think it will vanish after a period of time which will suck.
---
My wife got the ultracite targeting hud plan from a regular SB flying around the Steakhouse last night in Survival.
---
Hard to see much on your map, try a different colour for your dots and use a more hi-res version of the map, please.
---
Anyhow, here's my contribution: the penitentiary has three terminals very close to the main entrance alone, levels 1, 2, and 3, IIRC, or maybe one of them was even level 0.
---
Bethesda "We heard your recommendations and will nerf Strangler PA"
---
Split what the devs were working on and the adventure mode still needs a bunch of work.   I'll cheer if they ever close Nuclear Winter down also.
---
I'm of the opinion the devs  should work on making sure the engine &amp; game is working correctly before splitting devs off to do other modes.
---
I'm not against them having Survival and Nuclear Winter modes, I'm just of the opinion that they rushed it too much and should of worked it in once the game was actually able to handle it.
---
Dang. Wish I had that luck lol. Great to know they drop from normal sb as well!
---
If she's on xbox I'd give her 15k for it haha
---
Which platform? On PC I'm able to help üòâ
---
I enjoy hunting and stalking players but mode sucked so much they had to lure people with unique legendaries and bonus exp to the point where it was dead and was being using for vault raids.
---
The medic effect on weapons is typically useless like you said, however on shotguns it‚Äôs actually quite good. This is because each pellet applies the heal when you crit, I typically heal for about 1/3 or more of my health with every crit. 
---
Make sure you use four leaf clover with this build as each pellet that hits in vats has a chance to fill your crit bar. This allows you to crit practically every other shot in vats
---
Yh man good correction got myself confused I've edited response
---
Bye survival. Gonna miss all you bloodthirsty maniacs!! Murdering each other was fun while it lasted!
---
I heard it makes people PCs stutter. I want them to have fun with their armors, and those fixed. I hope this time they will actually step up other items instead of doing a PA nerf, but so far I've been proven to be pointlessly and baselessly optimistic :(
---
I'm on xbox and am looking for people to PvP with sometime. I am slowly finding the right people to practice with, but way more of my teammates have zero interest. 
---
Meanwhile, this is my endgame. 
---
Participated in a battle over the junkyard last night with an entire server essentially. That was a blast.
---
Its part of the game mechanics because it lets us play as raiders. Guessing your going to tell me next workshops shouldn't have pvp.
---
If you see any of the dense armor torso plans you should buy it and learn it straight away. Dense combat armor torso mod also exists.
---
Powering up Poisedon has a bunch of terminals, the dam has a couple and the power plants are good for one or two.
---
You mean love?
---
I found 2 for metal tosto and raider but i did not get the raider trade failed and crush :/
---
[here‚Äôs a song from Red Eye‚Äôs Raider Radio.](https://youtu.be/KSICZ3PEAUw) . Players just wanna ‚Äúraid‚Äù in whichever way gets em off. The same way you wanna be left untouched so bad...everybody has their own trip. But ultimately we share the fallout universe. And its world is fucked.
---
y‚Äôall over here asking for Fallout: Wasteland Sims Edition.
---
To answer your question, I‚Äôm sure OP gives a fuck. Lol
---
Trade interface drops all the time on PC, I have a mule account and sometimes end up trading one item at a time just to get *something* to transfer before the trade drops again.
---
 I'm glad they got rid of a mode that split development time.  Gives them more time to work on the actual game and bug fixes.  They also don't have to worry about balancing both modes at the same time which caused more problems than it was worth.
---
 The majority of the playerbase are solo non pvp players.
---
 I hope they do add some kind of PVP fix when they release Wastelanders but I hope they don't implement it in such a way to where it is mandatory for all to progress or get the best gear.
---
Disconnecting the power only stops the vendors showing on the map. Yiu just get a camp symbol
---
This bug has been in the game since day 1.
---
I would server hop if someone was around me while I was completing something and I didnt feel comfortable. My mess with your quest, but I would be happier with that than getting upset at some dude who gets his jollys off launching nukes
---
Anywhere near the primal cuts events at top of the world
---
If you don‚Äôt have subtitles on, flip them on. Grahm gives instructions while doing the meat cook. He also tells you what to do during the ‚Äúprepare for the meat cook to start‚Äù phase. 
---
I think the loading screen tells you now as well, but those don‚Äôt always hang long enough to read through. 
---
With a good group, you can usually get a meat cook done in about a minute. DM me for a list of ‚Äúcaptains‚Äù you can follow along on twitch and play with in PC. A number of streamers have a large community you can play with that know what they are doing, and all server hop in unison if they are in a scuffed server. 
---
As far as the other issues, lag has definitely been worse this week in silos and other quests.
---
We can only hope lol game overall still needs lots of polish and tweaks
---
No, it's a legacy. Like week ago one dataminer published information from gamefiles about weapon types which are energy and no longer drops with explosive affixes. Gauss is considered energy weapon.
---
Did you not look at the name? They are the Purveyor
---
That's what i do too. They are in a garage i flip a hidden switch and the door shuts and the machines power down
---
You can only deposit batches of 5 prime meat, yes? Why the hell was I given 4 pieces for every event completed?? 
---
Wasn't I supposed to get 5? Is this norm?
---
Same, would be cool to get from some detective quest along the lines of the quests from the Sheepsquatch update.
---
Wow, and they call us toxic. Can't even let us say goodbye without shitting all over it. Enjoy your flat build-a-bear wasteland. Try not to get killed by molerats.
---
Lol now it make sense
---
This is true end game.  Stealing nukes from people is goddamn hilarious.  Especially when you nuke their base afterwards
---
Thats what you call 'shitting all over' something? Oh boy, toughen up, snowflake. You'll be fine.
---
I play with a large group of people so it‚Äôs not that big of a deal but the respawn for primal cuts is outside the area and causes the event to fail instantaneously
---
Isnt that why they're getting rid of survival?
---
I'd imagine a lot of those will come with the Wastelanders patch, but sadly we know some of those won't arrive until 2020.
---
The reason why the PA is making everyone lag is the legacy OP explo lasers with a broken weapon mod. THe acid in itself doesnt lag.
---
the game has two list it keeps track off items you have picked up, world items and container
---
world items 160 or 180 (cant remeber), for items to populate again the need to be off the list
---
container items 60 or 80 (again I cant remeber) the same thing, for items to populate again the need to be off the list. 
---
its in here somewhere with more detail and it all works, in other words just pick everything you see.
---
Gotta build a wall of plushies to save you from all those mole rats!
---
Probably just toaster bath.
---
Foot traffic is a thing, but it' barely a blip on the radar.
---
I'm out in the middle of nowhere, and I capped 3 times last weekend (though weekends always seem better).  If people have money to buy stuff, 10 caps to fast travel isn't preventing anyone from making the trip.
---
be aware one of the items...hardened mass, I think, is considered junk, so you can lose it if you die.
---
Also, it scraps to ultracite, so be mindful about spamming the scrap button.
---
I'm still accumulating enough meat cleavers and tato salad that I can now build another tower made of meat cleavers and tato salad. Still no Tenderizer stuff unfortunately. I do like the black grillmaster chef hat, it's a nice look.
---
So change the screen color.  Not all computer terminals were green in real life; they also came in amber.
---
Your left or my left?
---
I just buy recall cards whenever I get to 26k caps. Usually keeps me level.
---
Based on non-existent fictional game mechanics, this might just leave you with underpowered armor.
---
Y'know, I mostly posted this to have some fun conversations ("bovinophobia" is such a great wordüòÇ) but you bring up a great point.
---
Y'all just wanna raid, and I just wanna fight monsters and not have to stop at my camp every five minutes to revive my cow. Why am I in the wrong for that?
---
We want the *choice* to be left the hell alone. Y'all had Survival, but instead of actually playing it and giving Bethesda feedback to fix it, y'all left it to rot and went out of your way to figure out how to keep harassing people in Adventure. So why is it that when someone speaks up against your bullshit, *we're* wrong?
---
"Raiders" in this game are nothing more than pathetic basement-dwelling losers who need an outlet for their shitty, toxic behavior. I just wanna come home from work and unwind by slapping a few Scorchbeasts out of the sky. Newsflash: People play games to *have fun*. If your idea of fun is being shitheads to everyone you come across, I'd hate to meet you in the real world.
---
While allocating the Survival servers to Adventure will likely offer a more stable experience, their focus is on Wastelanders and Bethesda said they'd bring back Survival once they figure out how to properly approach PVP in 76.
---
That's the funny thing, not really.ü§£ü§£ü§£ Razorgrain grows like weeds and I get so much steel from mole miners' shotguns that if I didn't make stupid amounts of ammo, my stash would be full constantly. I only brought it up to point out that I basically lose nothing but a little time.
---
Thanks, I know there is a refresh period for items you pick up, but didn't know it applies to events as well.
---
Yes and but have you ever seen a red or yellow one? As someone who has worked on vintage terminals before, the main colours you see are Black and White, Amber and black and Green and Black. In the fallout universe color monitors where not in existence and only mono colour ones existed. While with Fo76 colour tvs are now cannon there is no evidence that computers and display colour. The idea of mods and lamps attached to the pipboy are much more realistic and easier to imagine compared to ripping out a screen and replacing it with another one
---
That's nifty.
---
found the filthy!
---
Couldn‚Äôt we do that in fallout 4? I remember changing my hud to white on the pip boy and that changed mine to a white light but of course that was fallout 4 where we could customize our pip boy color idk why we can‚Äôt do that on this one
---
OMG the game is constantly crashing! Yesterday I stopped playing as I got tired of it..
---
Can't wait for Meat week to end so I can play again...
---
Couldn‚Äôt we do that in fallout 4? I remember changing my hud to white on the pip boy and that changed the green screen light to a white screen light but of course that was fallout 4 where we could customize our pip boy hud color idk why we can‚Äôt do that on this one
---
Here is your 12 buns for 8 hotdogs!
---
I think hazmat suit should be considered overarmor-Unarmed Gang
---
You could in all three 3D games. Options where blueish white, green and Amber.
---
*Time to edit the wiki article*
---
The amount of prime meat per event depends on the region. Forest is 3, Divide is 4, Bog is 5. Except no-one is doing the Primal Cuts events in the Bog or Mire, because the quest targets tend to get lost or hare off after random mobs at those locations.
---
Np, well yes and no. Event loot is event loot you get that as soon  as you finish the event, but the containers that are in place doesn't have to do with the event it self.
---
That would be nice. But you see, Todd has a hate boner for PA so it must always be disadvantaged compared to regular armor.
---
Gotcha, Thanks
---
I‚Äôve been dropping ammo and chems for low level players like crazy, have to build up my karma after I killed a low level playerü§ß
---
No, spent over a week reinstalling the whole game, only to log in and have it continue to crash. So no more Fo76 for me until I can hook it up to better internet and reinstall again. I'm thinking something happens during the downloads to corrupt the files. Only thing I can think of.
---
that will be 700 Atoms
---
Wallace in harpers ferry also has the plans FYI.
---
It's starting to make sense now. ...hnmm...
---
Something similar happened to me over the weekend. I opened the map to FT back to my camp, and noticed the icon was just a standard camp with no vendor. Got back there and everything was fine with the single exception that there was now no wire linking my vendor to the generator, so obviously it was no longer powered.
---
No idea how it suddenly became unlinked. There was no evidence of an attack, I hadn't been in any groups, and I hadn't built or altered anything in the camp for days. Was really odd.
---
Wasted your time, bethesda doesn't care about reports without videos or such lmao
---
Crashing, freezing, super laggy, and the loud pop and black screen after fast traveling. It's gotten to the point where I want to pull my hair out.
---
Thx
---
PS4 -I missed the first meat week, so this time its "new" to me.
---
Perhaps thats why my experience is different - Done 2 primal cuts, one successful, one not.  Done about 15 BBQs, all successful.
---
Got the Tenderizer, several legendary armor pieces, lots of cleavers, flag plan, several different outfits, tato salad, other food items, Have not yet gotten mods/mod plans for the tenderizer though.
---
Bonus: Graham has had several hard to find plans.
---
Bugthesda
---
It happens the same from the start with the combat rifle, it is assumed that it is not intended ... but it is not seen that they are in a hurry even though it is something very easy to fix ...
---
I like the NW theme more. It's gritty, intense and feels more like fallout imo.
---
Besides  the racist slurs, what you call griefing isn't illegal.
---
I did one successful cookout and was given The Tenderizer. Unfortunately, my character is not a melee build, and my stash was nearly maxed. I had to sell it :(
---
Tbh I leave the workshop because I thought it was more considerate. Like I want to PVP but I don't really want to mess up whatever you're working on. So I'll peace out right after. Kind of like leaving your goodie bag too, don't really need it, got enough inventory management to deal with.
---
 Oh yes it did contain griefers. Or am I none?
---
Yes, that's strange, but understandable if standard combat rifle shares with the fixer all mods, shame it also shares the same bug :) 
---
Does Automatic Prime Receiver also uses .44 ammo, I forget to check it yesterday?
---
Not sure if it was intentional or not but yeah the fixer and combat rifles use ultracite .44 instead of .45 for both the prime semi auto and prime automatic receivers.  I did the same thing that you did and thought I could use my .45 for both.
---
Wish I could produce 900 ears of corn for every square foot. Lol
---
Well at least you got money for it. Stash limit is better than it was but nowh8near enough. Its a game about collecting with no space to collect
---
Out of curiosity, are you even able to craft prime 44 ammo, or did it unlock plans for prime 45?
---
Survival is over for now, but the most effective build was commando with quad faster fire rate tesla.
---
But its junk so store it in your stash unless u want to risk loosing it if u die...
---
Don't do that.. you might look like me!
---
The marine tactical helmet plan is available on Xbox - it's just quite rare and doesn't appear to often. I found it on one character a while ago and picked up another plan recently that I'll move to another character at some point as it's relatively cheap to craft but sells for a decent price to vendors :)
---
Thx, looks like I'll recheck the damage difference with .45 and ultracite .44 and decide what to do.
---
It would finally be a use for the pre-war money in this game!
---
Also wish underarmor could be worn as apparel so we can see it without dyin. Some of it is really cool looking. I am sexy af in that marine wetsuit.
---
Bethesda is especially given to copypaste without checking things ... hence there are so many mistakes that reappear or even are from previous fallout games
---
Haha! My hero!
---
Sounds like it, hate to hear that!
---
My sons are too little but this is a dream of mine one day too. Thanks for sharing your journey so far.
---
I've learned all possible Prime receivers, so can craft any kind of Ultracite ammo. That's why I need to decide what kind of ammo use with it and if it's worth crafting ultracite .44 or stay with normal .45.
---
The Stealth tactical helmet or the Combat helmet, 1 I can make (last time I checked) the other can't be got on xbox
---
prime receivers are new to F76, so they've just mess things up ;)
---
A vats centered pistol build is pretty fun to play
---
I can only talk about last year but I think I remember teaching .45 ammunition, so you could not even create your ammunition.
---
It was painful for me because I used a combat rifle at that time ...: /
---
It's funny. I had a long conversation with a friend about that. He was saying that some sort of poison resistance would probably help, too. I feel like I am going to have to go exploring with two sets of armor and several guns...
---
I don't really have an issue with that. Workshops have always been PvP.
---
But that's pretty cool, have an upvote.
---
The mining helmet gives a normal color flashlight
---
That's what I was worried about. Dumb stuff.
---
Wrong.
---
Tell me why wearing a BOS Officer suit is OP for power armor but not OP for say Marine vanguard sentinel armor
---
that's witchunting
---
I will be very surprised if DR is capped, cuz I never heard of this before and ppl with like 600 energy Resistance truly dominate.
---
Idk about dmg reduction on dodgy 
---
And yeah, there is not a chance dev will comment on this :)
---
Name of a post apocalyptic punk rock band
---

but a girl has all bobbleheads
---
I've gotten 4 tenderizers and 5 mods
---
I usually play alone out of necessity. I log on and half the time the only person who's on is my go-to for serum. So I hear you, friend! It wouldn't be a problem that I'm not a Mothman cultist? Lol
---
On PS4 there‚Äôs no animation when using one
---
Never worked for me
---
Don't be afraid to die again and again and again. That and fast fire weapons is the key.
---
Sneak does double the crit, 50% is added to whatever damage you're doing
---
During meat week, bears spawn under my dome and start wrecking it sometimes.  Its because I'm close to a primal cuts event.
---
That no longer works for me.  I get 1 water when I drink and spam collection.
---
The strangler PA is perfect for my build and I want it so much, but I cannot and will not risk my entire characters inventory to complete it. It's common for me and my party to crash in high density areas and we just can't take that chance.
---
It breaks my heart really because it's a cool concept. I hope I. The future craftable legendaries will be incorporated in a much more positive way.
---
Tough choice then. üòï Side note- if you're on ps4 and stumble on an extra prime lever plan, I'd be down to deal.
---
they're easier than the one for the army at Camp McClintock, and that one is required for the main quest
---
Yep, still funny though.
---
Sneak doubles the end damage. So, if you did 100, and it's a crit of x2 that's 200, and then sneak makes it 400 if it's x2.
---
Tbh the dragon bat mutant is probably helping your sales
---
Thank you!
---
Although I suppose it doesn't really matter which happens first, according to PEMDAS
---
Dont worry i can take that fixer off your hands
---
And I laughed again. I wish. That neighbor I was talking about was the type to complain about everything. The dog was too loud (she was almost a mute), we were feeding the squirrels (kept them out of the gardens), AND we had a fire pit. Shooting pests in the safety of our own yard and freaking out the neighbor would have been a dream come true!
---
I think PA should have legendary effects - Association of minigun enthusiasts
---
I'm on PC and prime plans works that way, that you can't loot it from the SBQ anymore when you'll learn it. So finding one from players vendor is your only chance.
---
It‚Äôs almost never the case. I‚Äôm waiting like 1 hr and no one shows up to kill me.
---
Really? Where are you?
---
no doubt about it ;)
---
Weapon damage perks are null and void. Commando, Expert Commando, Master Commando, etc.
---
7000, you dropped a zero
---
I have marsupial (like everyone else) and bird bones, so I would reload midair, usually with enough time to out a shot into them when I was done.
---
Ahha so they don't drop and cannot be purchased from the purveyor? I wondered why I hadn't seen one for a bit.
---
put a switch on it
---
Awww. Love among the crabbies.
---
Oooh, gotcha. Thanks for the info.
---
I've got one I'm trying to sell. or trade. I'm looking for junkie and raider stuff!!!
---
People left survival when they removed the map markers and nerfed the damage down to nothing on top of the damage cap. Really sucked the fun out of it. Up until then it had a decent playerbase, I saw new players and groups crop up all the time.
---
Damn shame too, I don't want to pick on adventure mode players hoping I happen to attack someone who actually wants PVP.
---
If you do decide to farm for ultracite .44, I've had good luck getting crimson flux down by the queen and at big maw over in the mire.  Congrads on the sweet drop though!
---
I have no idea why you'd get downvotes for warning someone that their post breaks the rules, other than people are weird/assholes
---
Oooh! I believe mine is pronounced the same way, if I‚Äôm reading that correctly! ‚ÄúDee-nuh‚Äù! I live in a small town and frequently call a nearby small city for work and discovered someone in the same dept in my field has the same name, only spelled differently, and it tickles me every time I call them. üòÅ
---
Thanks friend! I hope you, Bessie and Daisy enjoy eternal bliss! At least they respawn fairly easily.
---
Just saw your picture. You're quite a ways off! Was it an adventure??
---
There is no Tenderizer plan. It is not a bug, but a feature

I just have my machines on a switched pole, when I am close to max caps, I just switch the pole off and my machines turn off. When I have some breathing room again with my cap level I come back to camp and open for business again....

[PVP AMAGE AND HOW TO RESIST IT!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/chruur/pvp_damage_and_how_to_resist_it_as_of_today/)
---
This is what I am using for reference. I have no hard evidence to support or deny, but simply post this as an opposing claim.
---
Ok so in theory this is how it should work ? With a crit modifier of 2.15 form mutations, better critical perk and a 50% crit gun , using a lever action that does 75 base damage with a paper damage of 172.5 (with bloody meat rifleman, hard receiver ) . You should crit for (75+172.5) x 2.15= 532.1 damage . Now if sneak applies after you're at 1064 . Now if all that bypasses armor because it's a crit that would be awesome , and again you could double it if a headshot?
---
I‚Äôve just added the prime meat events into my daily XP grind.  
---
Was there a plan for the tenderizer?  I have it but can‚Äôt mod it.
---
Its not just location, there are tons of us that travel. I bet I spend 400 - 700 in caps in a week just traveling around to camps to see what I can buy....
---
I shouldn't laugh. I know that. But I keep re-reading "because screw reconsidering your choices" and I start all over again.
---
Picture of the elephant, less funny. I'm guessing someone was careless around a circus elephant?
---
Thx, but it's not my drop - I've traded 4 top-tier items for it, my best drop from Purveyor was similar The Fixer (VE15reload), but traded it so fast I couldn't even try to modify it ;)
---
I got at least 10 crimson fluxes in my stash, which can allow me to craft 1080+ bullets (if superduper procs), but will need to buy some lead first ;)
---
you had to remove your clothing and armor yourself, whatever you were wearing before you got in power armor is automatically reequipped when you exit it
---
Great idea, I love punch bowls and this is an interesting expansion of that.
---
Haha, well add me \[mylkozrajky\] and I might come for some... testing.
---
It seems like pretty much every post gets immediate downvotes. Some people think there are bots that people run to do it for whatever reason.

At any rate, it's not just you.
---
The first day of meat weak on Xbox people were trying but in the last day I‚Äôve done prime meet solo like 15 times and only one had the bbq event succeed once
---
All you need to get the max reward is two people, I've been doing it with my partner most of the week.
---
Drains ap like a mother.
---
tell me how it would be?  with armor you get the underarmor, backpack, resistances *AND* legendary effects, with PA you only get resistances
---
What axe are you talking about?
---
How much prime meat do you start with. Presume chally feed and ignore drums and spit.
---
You've put quite a lot of thought into this. I love the sign idea!
---
underarmor, not regular armor
---
That would be my guess as well.  Someone might have been fleeing a Scorchbeast or something and ran to your CAMP thinking it would help, got killed, and never came back.
---
How long ago did this happen? It was 25k for the longest time.
---
Hiii
---
everything you were wearing when you got in the PA automatically reequips when you exit PA
---
People still go looking for people minding their own business, enjoying this garbage; just to tell them it's garbage? 
---
Bigly Sad.
---
6 hours and if you count the time it takes to get back on the game after crashing in vault 51 12ish hours
---
Lol about 2 updates ago buddy!
---
Seriously this. Dying a million times is inevitable if you want to git gud. You learn a lot from your murderers.
---
I can confirm that fix did NOTHING for me.
---
If you know a nuke is coming can‚Äôt you just move your base???
---
what?  how is 3 extra inches of leather not bulky?
---
This right here is the only reason I have power armor.  My armor values are much higher just in my vanguard + grounded get up than in any PA I own.  My rad resistance is a big fat 0 though.  If I could wear the Mechanist's Outfit over my armor, why can't I wear a HazMat suit?
---
Yes, but you can‚Äôt distinguish what you had equipped and what you didn‚Äôt have equipped, so you may forget which armor you mean to keep and which you mean to scrap or sell.
---
IMO, the best solution would be for them to not be available (or show on the map) if power is cut.
---
There's really no valid reason why they should still be accessible without power.  They visually aren't "on" and it reeks of a beginner's trap.
---
what a knob
---
Out of the loop, what is wastelanders?
---
Angry Joe's video on it has one of his friends pretty much calling people that play fallout 76 morons. Insult the game, sure. But one of the biggest youtube reviewers shouldn't be insulting the games fanbase.
---
The direct quote was "if you play fallout 76, everything around you is a choking hazard."
---
AYEEE lol hi Slayden
---
Unfortunately applying this did nothing for me while facing somebody wearing the armor in pvp. I am running a GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER with an Intel i7-9700K.
---
Oh yeah, black and white.  So it can be changed to white and any one of a number of colored filters would change the light color.
---
oh, I see, yeah that can happen, just rename your personal gear
---
This, kind sir or madame, is thr point of this post: to help Bethesda grow legendary crafting for a broader spectrum of players and playstyles.
---
It should be 100% possible to grow wealthy and powerful and influencial in this game concentrating 100% on crafting within a single niche.
---
Thanks! Im just hoping to get it done soon before I get wrapped up in RDR2 again lol
---
Its not surprising; Most of us already got everything the first time it happened. 
---
I personally got the weapon a bunch of outfits and a dozen hats (bloody and black combined) so aside from the scrips which you can easily get elsewhere most uf us don't need this event. I personally don't bother going to it at all this time. 
---
However if they did add new rewards to it, it would have been a different story.
---
The what..?
---
I'm not sure where you're getting that crit damage stacks the weapon damage again. The number you see in the pip boy is your base damage, after calculating weapon damage, perks, legendary effects etc.
---
So, for simplicity, 100 damage in the pip boy, you do a critical weak spot shot, weak spot x2 is 200, x2 crit is 400, x2 sneak makes 800. Which sounds feasible, I do similar damage in practice so.
---
It didn't register for me and i just built the frog habitat 10 mins ago
---
I won't lie, I just went "aww" a little bit. I like that you intended for it to be all of you, and I love that your son helps you out of sticky situations. Sounds like a good kid, so kudos to you!
---
Looks more like half an inch to me
---
You don't get the 75+172.5 it's just the 172 that is multiplied
---
I may be wrong, but it looks like the greaser jacket and jeans.
---
To me, it seems top of the world is a very common place for camps to be placed even with no meat week.
---
I've been looking for at the Watoga Station for what seems like months. I don't hop for it but I do check every time I play. Last weekend I got the one for leather, which does me no good at this point, but hey, it's a start.
---
I'm pretty much a Noob when it comes to 76. What is the result of being reported?
---
Use .38 ammo. It‚Äôs way cheaper with not much of a damage hit.
---
Wow, i want them all toooooo
---
Oh did I miss something? Survival is getting removed? :o
---
Breach and Clear has been bugged for a while. If you are the ONLY person in render distance, it works fine. If someone else is even just questing nearby, it doesn't work. I think what happens is it tries to instance the containers, and instead ends up deleting everything.
---
I wish raises were that easy to get huh
---
then you clearly don't know distances, maybe not 3 inches everywhere but at least an inch or two, but def 3 or more on the pauldrons, also even a half inch is thicker than a SKIN TIGHT body suit literally made to be worn in PA
---
Boy you aren't kidding about the strangler PA, I got dropped so fast by that even in survival mode. My only defense was keeping my distance and not getting hit. Isn't it because it's a new damage type, acid? Maybe they should add acid resistance to the mix of legendary effects and base armor mods like we have for rads and poison.
---
I know that. Not my question. I'm talking about seeing the stealth boy player THROUGH walls.
---
What? What do you mean spoiled axe?
---
Leave an extractor unlocked and place a pumpkin ontop!
---
They drop in order only, if you've learnt them they move to the next one.
---
Did you mean Spiked Fire Axe mod?
---
If so, you get it from scrapping Fire Axes.  Never seen it as a world spawn item.
---
Okay Jesus. Then just let light leather armor be wearable with PAs. Those don't look thick at all
---
According to another poster here it seems cutting power will slow sales down.
---
Getting that tato salad plan is the main reason I kept logging in every hour hoping that I would get lucky.  I finally struck gold last night at 1am.  But mostly I got a lot of hats.
---
The plan is extremely rare, but the Mod can sometimes be found at Camp Venture near the Drop Box, and on the crates near the PA Stations.
---
Ok thx!so i just got knight cpt paint,do u perhaps know if there anymore after this?and if i dont learn this plan the chance is it‚Äôl drop again?
---
Haha, not a problem at all. In fact, I'm growing out of that phase of my life... I quit the blood sacrifices, closed my cultist temple, and moved to be closer to the river. But my character is still very witchy and definitely in touch with her dark side. I might start a goth-witch faction! Cannibalism optional.
---
I have played well over 1000 hours on xbox and, in my experience, running into griefers has been a rarity.  Maybe, though, it's because I'm high-level and they tend to target the weak instead of someone who potentially might be able to kick their ass.
---
I've read it's based on fallout 4's crit calc. According to the wiki , crit damage  = base damage + paper damage X crit multiplier 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Critical_Hit
---
Buy stuff. That‚Äôs all you have to do.
---
Ohhh. Yeah definitely that should work
---
There are many things that can be factors but you are not alone. Personally feel that anything that shows this community as mentions, a nice community others don't like it because they feel we make them look bad so they downvote to oblivion.
---
yeah don't worry I'm an idiot
---
I haven't tested this extensively enough, but before I changed my armor to have some poison resistance I was literally OHKOed 100% of the time, and after I changed my armor to accomodate for this new danger, I have managed to win some of those David vs Goliath fights, but they certainly felt like fighting an experienced Titan while yourself playing as a Pilot in Titanfall (you basically die in one hit so you do everything to deny this single hit to your opponent, for those who don't know the game, its an FPS where you can rather swiftly change the size of your character from regular super fast jetpack doublejumping human to 8 meters high robotic machine of destruction that can take dozen times more hits before surrendering.
---
I get this is a fun way to highlight a bug but still feels creepy
---
It's reddit. It happens lol. 
---
Also, we have FAR from the nicest online gaming community. There are a lot of really nice people yes, but we don't stand out above the rest, except that the passive minded people are more likely to keep playing when everyone else stops üòÇ.
---
Gonna miss that bloodthirsty vault boy
---
The party is PvP after the event is done.  I so wish you could PvP Grahm and his rambling Kermit sounding ass.
---
Last night, there was a guy with a plasma gatling standing above the meat/greens turn-in area shooting everything, making puddles of goo.  I started to wonder if that caused problems with the critter respawn.
---
Not very effective, but super adorable! ;)
---
Dif. characters, dif. spots. Near Camp Venture, at a cabin near the place where the Overseer recorded her last holotape, close to Raleigh's bunker. People really shop close to Whitespring area. I sometimes just dump ammo among characters, like, the one who uses a shotgun collects 45 for the one who uses the lever action, and so on...
---
I'm sad the original post was deleted. What's this about wet kitty mode? lol
---
Actually yeah, that could work. Good thinking
---
Very viable in a skilled hand with the right perks.
---
We need "Eternal Flame" on the radio.
---
üéÇ
---
Just some dunce talking nonsense, really. Barely gave it a second thought
---
I think it would be rare though like maybe only Enclave has a stash of black and white screens.
---
Nope. The rate of fire is too low for most mission areas, the boss fights, and the raid. Skill is irrelevant.
---
Eh I'm one of (I'm guessing very few) people who would be hesitant to call for a nerd to something we have been grinding for over a month to get and grinding something that half this subreddit calls a waste of time or "not worth it". Its worth it to me and if Bethesda's comes down with another one of their unbalanced nerds and nerds it beyond usability than that's bullshit. At this rate only 1% of players are ACTUALLY gonna complete the armor anyway because the other 99% complain about it too much (over old issues I might add) or don't have people to run it with. It's a raid it's not really designed for solo play which I know sucks but it is what it is. I say let the people who put in the work reap the rewards. They deserve it for persevering.
---
I wanted to put a big sign saying please don‚Äôt kill my Brahmin, but the only plans I have are for the tiny letters you can barely read. It took me a while to revive home after the first time he was killed simply because I forgot to go find razorgrain. But he‚Äôs finally up and running again
---
Exactly! Pip boy light would be illuminating everything to the side of you if lore was correct*
---
It's an update coming in November that'll add NPC's to the game, bringing quests with "choice and consequence" along with many features that you would typically find in a standard Fallout game.
---
No, I've got 3k+ of normal .45 ammo I've been using with Lever, so I'll use hardened receiver if damage loss won't be significant.
---
I get killed by mole rats almost daily. I went to survival mode maybe 4 times and it wasn't for me but I'm still sorry to see it go, really sucks for people who are into pvp
---
I actually don‚Äôt mind the griefers or those that want to PvP it‚Äôs the greedy asses that take over events or steal the glory by one shotting the bosses.  Someone hijacking the silo is probably the worst example.
---
I have one of those and even with a high voltage hefe it can‚Äôt match the stopping power of my B/FFR handmade. 
---
I only pulled it out if my opponent was using a stealth boi.
---
Meh.
---
I believe you learn it automatically the first time you pick up tic blood or a tic blood sac (can't remember which).  Regardless, I would go kill some tics and loot their bodies.  That should do the trick.
---

I built this one at 9 stories tall. I use the environment make my builds bigger. Many of my builds use a cliffside or pre-existing environmental feature (cave, bridge, etc.) to help me build up and to create unique parts of the C.A.M.P. 
---
https://youtu.be/p2X4hA9jjIc
---
This one has a fully enclosed waterfall. It was 7 stories tall.
---
https://youtu.be/ptv28RgDHDs
---
This one was designed to be a concert hall.
---
Is this the "Blueprint Glitch" I keep hearing about? Didn't realise it was that easy, could've saved myself a lot of work :p
---
At least Paladin and Elder
---
Ideally you'll would have two pieces armor with +25 poison resistance, for a total of 50. If you're not careful, a legendary Mirelurk Queen will still kill you with poison fairly quickly but it makes a big difference.
---
I believe your right. Assholes are going to drive ppl out of the game because they want to play FO76, not a FO version of COD or Apex. I think by this weekend we‚Äôll see a flood of shitheads so I guess get your boots out cause it‚Äôs going to get deep. I think those who do this can‚Äôt cut it in NW so they take their anger out in Adventure mode.  After posting this it‚Äôs pissed some ‚Äúraiders‚Äù off. It‚Äôs funny that they think ‚Äú raiders‚Äù are a thing still. They say raider, I say asswipes.
---
Catheter.
---
Rich merchant problems... if it is for sale, it is for sale. You want the game to spend resources loading and keeping track of your inventory inside the vending machine when you are not going to sell? Removing and restocking is part of the game.
---
Agreed, this is why this post is not about putting down the Strangler but rathet than that elevating EVERYTHING else for the sake of actual build diversity.
---
I mean, I believe that it should actually be possible to create the legendary gear around which everything revolves in a more efficient way on a high-intelligence character, than it is possible on my low-intelligence, one-shooting almost-everything, SBQ shredding combat character.
---
I kind of want a mole rat plushie now. Look at those cute little teethies!
---
If you turn on damage numbers in game, it will give an idea on what you're doing.
---
Totally agree. It was kinda fun again for the first few days this time, but a whole week is too much... i still drop in to the grahm events when I can, but almost never the primes.  Wish they'd either made some changes to the activities/loot of meat week, or brought back that other festival (the one w/ the weird masks) as I totally missed that one.
---
So much useful plastic!
---
It is relevant. You have to know how to use them. Their function isn‚Äôt for running into mobs. It‚Äôs to drop high damage sneak shots on high health high armor enemies than finish them off with another weapon. Ammo conservation and sneak sniping are it‚Äôs best attributes. Why would you use a slow fire rate weapon in doors?
---
[Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww.](https://i.imgflip.com/mtfzf.jpg)
---
It's weird to me - the YouTubers carry on like the entire game is just in constant flames, and meanwhile the community here is mostly just playing and enjoying themselves just fine.
---
"This game is the shittiest of absolute shit also I don't own it and have never played it"
---
First of all, you named your female brahmin Rufus. Awesome! And you're not a terrible person. It was an accident. üòÑ
---
Wastelanders has been in the works for a while now, so if they haven‚Äôt started optimising the servers for NPCs, new scripts and more potential players like at least 3-4 months ago then I have some extremely bad news.. a little under 2 months is not enough üò∞
---
And we all know how the B.E.T.A went with only 1 month to prepare the servers..
---
No, that's justice
---
Wait, why is everyone collecting cloth?
---
They work like prime receivers (so won't drop anymore when learned), but you get them in order, not randomly - it's Initiate, Knight, Knight CPT, Knight SGT, Knight Officer, Paladin, Elder.
---
Left to the direction you spawn in
---
I personally hate YouTubers a lot. I enjoyed it before it was so heavily monetized.
---
haha, you mean like a 4th-of-july BBQ in august (or september)
---
Can you get the plans on multiple characters? My 2nd character ain't getting any plans or outfit from the technical data.. I've delivered like 100 or more by now..
---
dude, do you not get it?  a regular SUIT would be too much to wear inside PA, that is why skin tight body suits, such as the BOS underarmor, were made to wear in them.  not to mention wearing armor under PA would just be OP, to get resistances *AND* legendary effects ON TOP of the PA buffs?  way too OP
---
Oh boy.. Are you sad they added all those colorful pip boy skins too?  So it's ok to change your hud display, but god forbid someone changes the color of their pip boy screen. lol
---
Sadly it won‚Äôt let you enter diamonds/circles/stars or other special characters to mark your stuff, only alphanumeric. Lost my Pearly Peepers targeting binoculars because I didn‚Äôt realize in time that they were custom-named. Would love to be able to mark items as ‚Äúnon-salable/non-scrappable‚Äù.
---

"video games have zero affect on real life"
---
Yea, right. Bullying, which this is, has the exact same effect on someone whether it's online or not.
---
I would of thought so, but I don't know for certain.
---
I know drop chance is tiny.
---
Because most of it is lifeless, and boring.
---
name one online game with a nicer community, I mean even Kotaku did an article on our community, what other game do players just leave aid and gear in containers for other players, what other community goes out of their way to help low levels?  I'm not saying they don't exist but they also have more trolls and griefers than this game has
---
I like this idea, and wouldn't be terribly surprised if something like this happens.
---
I got it on first server try, but it was pure luck, the public events that are parts of daily challenges is definitely a poor design. They should either remove those challenges or change them to be weekly - this way it's much easier to find the event, especially when someone is casual who don't spend hours/a day in the game.
---
Cool must've been lucky on my first character then.. got all the paints in the first 30 data I delivered.. but not any on this one :(
---
How is it tin foil hat for a biz to use social media to their advantage ? You honestly think all the online outrage is real?! Oh my. That is terrifying. You must think the world is caving in.
---
Taking a nuke isn't bullying and if a kid doesn't know better than to treat video games like they are real life then that's on the parents.
---
This sub is mostly about Fallout 76 *the game*, not real life issues.
---
Have to tried coffee?
---
Nah, you gotta strip down if wanna fit in that chonky boy
---
Yea that's a good idea, I'll have to fart around with it.. I started a sneak rifleman, so just trying to figure out how I want to build him.  This is what I'm leaning towards. I have an executions vats crit vats cost lever I'ma use, and hopefully find an instagating none down the road to switch between .
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f145ff&amp;d=ao0a32pd2pk2pp2pl2p02e00ic4lt2a72lv2l10lk2c72a00l71lu2ar2an2s60a50&amp;w=&amp;n=Stealth%20rifle&amp;m=05c19fe83&amp;nw=
---
Faster fire rate and less vats action points are usually sought after the most. There is also a weight reduction croud that is appealing to some overencumbered player builds.
---
I keep Peabody and Sherman inside a barn.
---
mob justice is literally not justice, also the rule exists for a reason, anyone can make a post and lie about the players in it.  for instance a griefer could be salty another player bested him and post a lie saying the other player sniped his silo, not saying OP is lying but that is literally why the rule exists.  just report the player through the proper channels
---
You say their purpose is for high damage but they are out DPSed by almost every other weapon in the game so that's a moot point.
---
Assuming credit is based on functionality, replay value and stability I believe you seem to have already answered your own question?
---
Typo..crowd
---
it lets you use brackets and parentheses
---
Melee Weapon are better than ranged due to the inherent STR buff that the overall Build has effecting the damage output.
---
Then play something Else? Or just wander around and look at some of the Nice things they make for us to explore
---
The Enclave.
---
Didn't think Initiate dropped any more?
---
Because it's always easier to tear down what others do as opposed to building something. It also doesn't help that being outraged on the internet gives people the attention they need to feel special more than posting positive content does. There is a huge sense of entitlement for what they feel a game is supposed to give them.
---
Fallout 76 while not perfect has a ton to offer and is an ambitious project that I think is a precursor for future Bethesda games.
---
I‚Äôve heard that meat hooks are in high demand.
---
That'll be 1000 atoms please
---
I just put down a few then blueprint, you could use either the rug trick or the camp fire trick to get Them down too
---
I wasn't saying I didn't want to play the game, he was asking why people didn't give Bethesda credit for the world. I was just saying most of it was boring and lifeless because most of the space is just forests, and the lack of humans make it feel lifeless.
---
:O
---
You can try blueprinting a row of crops. It's worked for me and speeds up the planting.
---
I've started noticing that when I'm trying to pick something up/ access something on the ground, if it is ANY* lower than I am, I cant pick anything up/ clean up rotten meat week leftovers etc.. maybe if you walk to a spot that is a bit lower than where you're trying to place food.. maybe that will work?
---
Same thing has happened to me.  I used to do this event pretty regularly, and the last 2 or 3 times I've gotten nothing.  I was about to post but beat me to it, seems like it's less of a bug now and something pretty consistent.
---
Due to
---
A, Being a Melee Weapon
---
B, Counting as both Unarmed and 1-Handed
---
dude we all love 76's world thats why many of us are still playing it. They have been getting praises for that nonstop, do you want people to forget all other ugly stuff they did (like releasing a really, I mean REALLY buggy game, fridge/bot shenanigans, disregarding customer satisfaction etc you know I could go on)? 
---
Let me do an amazing food analogy my man as people seem to like them so much and I'll do critical parts in bold as you seem to like those so much!; if your **favorite restaurant chain** served you a **subpar meal** and failed to bring it up to their **usual standard** for a **whole year** when you still **stick with them**, would you at least not **complain?** 
---
I could give a harry potter one too, people seem to like that as well
---
Husband and wife found dead 100 bullet wounds
---
You dick! Haha. Well servers gone down now, so might have a coffee actually!üëç
---
A suppressed gauss at night is the only thing that can out hit it because bp stuff has no silencer attachment. That‚Äôs it. Even a pipe bolt with all 18 points doesn‚Äôt do more.
---
I'd be down with leveling the playing field to an extent I'm just worried as Bethesda has been pretty heavy handed when it came to balancing In the past as long as they look into it carefully with respect to the people who grinded the PA I'd be cool with it because it IS raid gear it deserves to be a "little" op
---
Lack of humans? Lore? Were the first out of the valut, where should those People Come from? But your getting your human npc in the next dlc
---
How could you kill a guy with god mode, though? Must have been demigod, at most.
---
Yeah I paid 7500 for a swing speed anti armor meat hook. I‚Äôm looking for a better 3* but not sure if I have the caps for it just yet lol
---
DPS means damage per second not base damage per shot. It IS our DPSed by almost every gun in the game.
---
if you really need cloth just grab every duct tape and pre war money you find, you will find you need to pare down the stack soon enough
---
And I'm a bum that spends way too much time on here but it still never came up. Maybe if I wasnt server kicked every hour or so I might have had a chance.
---
I'm building this to play with my wife. Could I get your full build?
---
Thanx dudeüëçüèø
---
Yeah, you'd think a nuclear war had happened or something.
---
Aren't they?
---
The servers just went down, but I'll try and remember the key things
---
I really want PVP to be tweaked, after overall performance of course, certain needs and buffs are needed and could be a lot more smooth, performance and bugs need addressed ASAP
---
There should still be human npcs though, look at the other fallout games
---
/r/firstpostapocalypticworldproblems
---
that was a stupid move man I noticed that as well, and I'm pretty fucking sure they are not random as this week we constantly had meat eating challenges.
---
Legendary mods to make your own legendary weapons/armors. Simple.
---
If that starts just exit the build menu and open it up again without moving from your current location at all. It usually allows me to build once I get back into the build menu
---
Did you really? My day is made! That's fantastic!
---
"A ton to offer". Lol
---
Of course! 
---
"There's no whining in the post-apocalypse!"
---
\-Me
---
Well yeah. It‚Äôs for sniping. By those standards every bolt action rifle is trash. DPS should never be mentioned with sniping. It‚Äôs not made for DPS. It‚Äôs made to do as much damage in one shot as possible.
---
it's not weird at all, a lot of games change things to promote the current dlc release, it will change again when Wastelanders comes
---
its 00.00 here my man I'm helping myself to a nice cold beer, kinda curios about the update
---
Did you ever go to the teapot? Sometimes it triggers when you walk up
---
what a 0.05% chance of dropping isn't reasonable????.... /s   
---
But seriously thanks for commenting and we can hope!
---
For a long time it was the only paintjob that drops from the quest, so probably everyone had it. When they've introduced the rest, simultaneously they've broke the initiate, so it wouldn't drop anymore, thus preventing from dropping other unless you bought it from someone. What's more strange, Initiate un-learned for some people (me including), so I could paint every other paints except initiate. I've bought the plan and re-learned it. Like two patches ago they've change the look of elder, that now looks like the Sentinel before (which wasn't officially in the game) and claimed to fix the initiate drops again, but I have no way to check it by myself, since I know all the paintjobs already.
---
Thanks for the comment, trying to make the game a bit better!
---
How about nobody likes a know it all or a snitch , if you arent a mod leave it alone
---
Well I know some easy ways but I'm sure r/fo76 is not the place to talk about them ü§îü§îü§î
---
we also haven't had a new dlc update since it released, we have only seen 2 dlcs since launch, Wild Appalachia and Nuclear Winter, the first dlc wasn't big enough for the change, it will change again with Wastelanders
---
This made me smile. I liked your story (and wasn't creeped out, so I'm unsure why people are upset). What system are you on?
---
What? I am confused. Where did I say this? Its perfectly reasonable for custom paint jobs to exist for pipboys. I think you are looking for a fight in a forum.
---
Great idea, but someone's gotta keep my robot Kilroy company while I'm out, y'know? Plus I maxed out my budget already üòÇ
---
It's too difficult to trace cooldowns and sequence, so sometimes server change is better solution than waiting on one for quest to appear.
---
I'm pretty sure it doesn't do that since it became a public event. But I did go up to it yeah, to do the strange brew daily. Didn't work.
---
As far as guns go, bloodied explosive and faster fire rate are very sought after. I lucked out on a BE 50 cal from the purveyor, and traded it for a BE handmade. It's at something like 350 damage when I hit nerd rage, and could probably be more as I'm still re-speccing into a bloodied build. I also have a 1\* blooded lever rifle which does insane damage with the rifleman perks.
---
Going to light the pumpkins love.. see you next tuesday.
---
Can votes get you macdonalds? No. So why bother about it?
---
how about people RTFM
---
Like your sex life, bam Son take a seat! Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm sure you can hire a mod to fix that problem!!
---
Nothing regarding structural elements of the game is simple, but that's basically what this post said should be added.
---
Interesting, as Initiate never dropped for me or the wife ( 3 Characters) but she got Knight as her first drop (which I took as she doesn't where PA). Neither of us has had another drop since.
---
If you do build a barn do 2x3. They always get out if it‚Äôs 2x2.
---
If people can still buy and you don't get caps it's not part of the game.
---
Well people here don't seem to care too much about balance here so why not? Besides, I don't necessarily think you have to wear skin tight suits since a single suit of PA can fit people of all sizes and sex so I bet there's plenty of space inside power armor of at least it's adjustable according to your size
---
People have definitely given up. I have some friends online (regulars) who get hostile when you bring it up now. 
---
They see it as a waste of time and now a waste of a valuable spot in the event queue. 
---
Will definitely concur it feels like the rewards have been skewed towards the clothes - specifically the hat.
---
As well primal cuts now feel useless to do for 5 scrip. Legendaries spawn seemingly 1/20 plus most of the events everyone is at - only reward 4 - which you can‚Äôt turn in and means your gonna watch that ‚Äúprime meat‚Äù spoil. 
---
(Which is bad - there should be no minimum)
---
If you love Halloween like I do, there's a lookout tower where the notes reveal a story about two employees getting REALLY over zealous about their Halloween decor and refusing to take it down. It's quite fun.
---
Sounds legit. I'll try it. lol
---
For wandering the wasteland, Underoos are fun to use!
---
I'd have done that anything, I feel like those proportions work better for a barn. But thanks for the advice!
---
Then support the idea that proposes a way to get other types of equipment to the new level of the field, instead of taking the level down.
---
I don't even use power armor and I think you should be able to wear under armor in it. I thinks it's absolutely stupid that you can't.
---
So I'm right. It's not viable for any of the main game activities. It's not viable for any interiors which make up most missions, or for the SBQ fight, the imposter fight, the vault raids, or PvP. They are just a novelty that don't outperform almost anything. Even in "sniping" they are outperformed by every other rifle including the railway, lever action, handmade, laser sniper, and hunting rifle.
---
we could in 4, i forgot what menu it was in but i remember i ran a more yellow color in 4.
---
no idea why they didnt copy those files over, its in the ini for pc users
---
I mean there were humans on that region juuust before 2102, there will be humans in 2103, there are humans wayyy after that on much harsher zones (boston&amp;washington)
---
I admit it is lore friendly but it is not because of a nuclear war, it was because of one politician's actions. You shouldn't straw man out of this my man.
---
ps. tbh I kinda liked the scorched saga but I had enough and just about ready to engage with some fellers
---
It could have changed, many months have passed since I gathered all the plans.
---
Well, as long as the PA proc makes the players comps crashing one after another, it is as useless as any random PA frame you could come across with imo.
---
The other Fallout games take place further in the future, so have had longer to repopulate and build a new world.
---
wtf are you talking about?  literally everyone complains about the balance
---
That's pretty much all I'd do.
---
Disconnect the power wire
---
I mean it, in a lot fewer words.
---
Still not p2w
---
That would be helpful. Do you know if Field Surgeon affects teammate healing when I heal with a stimpack? Whether I revive them of use it on myself plus the perk that shares that healing.
---
I *don't* care about the downvotes, I specifically asked why people are assholes
---
I bring in about 1500 caps a day and currently maxed at 30k
---
I heard that it's bugged. Should be a great perk, equal to a rank of bloody mess but with the added bonus that if you use it on the SBQ *everyone* is gunna do an additional 5% damage. If/when they fix it, I'm curious to find out if it stacks for each player.
---
This is me, being behind the times. *sighs* Thank you, sir!
---
\-Noticed the Bar variation as well, topping off and then dropping, glad to know I'm not the only one, will document and report.   
---
\-Maybe he's just a little nuttier than we realized?!?!  But seriously, great video, thanks!.  
---
\-Agree, and TBH I'd classify this as a bug, it falls under the same issue most weapons have with mods, I mean why would adding a sight to a mini-gun weight a few pounds?   
---
\-Valid thought, since they are replacing the Horde events I doubt they tweaked the schedule, but it's worth mentioning.  
---
\-I'll peak at the event, only done a handful of the Ashheap events, hadn't noticed that.  
---
\-The non-combat animation is long, replacing that Animation is one of the first things many PC players do, good QoL Suggestion for the PA page.  But hell we should be able to play the drum in PA.  
---
\-Generally Disagree we should force players to move camps, or limit near events, many players (I'm biased because I am one of them) set up "Support bases" specifically to make the events easier to work with for the players involved (Workbenches, water, defensive turrets)...   Those who don't provide a benefit, it's only a short time event, so...
---
Oh, it'll be much more and then even more on glowing mobs if you keep glow sighted perk slotted. It'll shred mobs to pieces. Only thing that gives me issues is sheepsquatches. Everything else goes down quick.
---
Haha! Now I REALLY need the PS4 version to go on sale! I'll throw on some ritual bindings and see you there! lol
---
If you feel like ragequitting now, be prepared for some equally bad feelings when your crops are targeted by mobs. Always so much snapped corn. :-( I scrapped my adhesive farm in the end. Sorry for this sprinkling of doom and gloom, but to be forewarned is to be forearmed etc. That said, I have since read that planting a scarecrow is meant to help protect your plants. I hope that's true, as it'd be very cool if scarecrows were functional and not just creepy garnish. I also saw some YouTuber explain a trick for growing crops indoors that might be worth seeking out.
---
I want to wear my hazmat suit with armor too! I run vanguard as well. I'm sitting at 575 DR and 620 ER. That 1000 RR would be amazing! I keep my Prototype hazmat suit on me at all times for nuke zones
---
Interesting thought, honestly I'd think the Prime Beasts should have a chance to drop prime meat, would make "grinding" the Primal Cuts events a little more satisfying, especially if they bug out part way through.
---
The trait of shooting multiple projectiles is as valid for shotguns, and they aint legacy OP explo lasers.
---
Truth been told, the OP explo laser part of this damage is nonexistent and neglible, its only powerful because of the speed at which it can apply stacks. The thing that this speed is not particularly relevant as it doesn't matter if you get three shotgun shots or three thousand explosive plasma shots - you're dead anyway. Quad double barrel shotgun level 10 is just as deadly as maxlevel BE plasma with beam splitter, as far as Strangler PA acid damage boost is concerned
---
This community isn't one of the nicest in online gaming. You guys just like smelling your own farts.
---
I give Bethesda alot of shit but this was very cool of them üëç
---
Cos we are on earth... welcome to earth
---
This ^. Just take a deep breath and go back at it.
---
Yeah, that is its main purpose. But I think most people use stealth-boys (from what I've heard; I never played survival for PvP).
---
Another build is gunslinger with a quad/two shot faster fire rate gamma gun, which is most effective against low-health builds.
---
You‚Äôre just pulling things out of your ass now. Plenty of factual base damage numbers that proves that completely wrong.
---
is one of the rewards an actual plan for the tenderizer? so far ive only gotten the weapon itself and some of the mods to add salt to it
---
People shop in the forest, too. HIGH levels. Found a level 900+ the other day. The mind boggles. I figure it's the free FT to the vault.
---
Thanks for the comment and link, great info!  
---
There is a Tenderizer plan (check the weapons section of this post), they just failed to add it to any leveled lists!
---
I agree it doesn't make sense but you can hotkey a hazmat suit and switch to it before the rads kill you.
---
Those are rookie numbers
---
&gt;this community  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;you guys
---
found the salty twat that doesn't play or like the game but has no life so they peruse the forums of a game they don't play or like.
---
why are you even here?
---
also, if you actually played you would see how nice the community is
---
The dirtiest trick I ever employed in PvP was to built a super-shiny-super-reflective CAMP which whole purpose is to crash the CPU of Strangler PA users.
---
The more intense the issue the greater the backlash, the greater the backlash the quicker the fix. Sorry not sorry :D
---
Because no one likes that type of person online or in real life ..they're the kinda person who would work an "internal affairs" job .. and no one likes them either
---
I‚Äôll fill mine with nukashine
---
Bethesda leadership?  Yes
---
Bethesda workers? No. 
---
They're pretty decent people trying to produce quality products
---
Read what people are saying in this post. They are cool with the idea of wearing PA on top of underarmor.
---
More than once, I've fast traveled to a location near a nuke zone without my PA on, and when I arrived,  I was in the zone. Which I wasn't supposed to be able to travel too. Because, Bethesda. Just add it to the list. They'll get to it eventually. Hopefully in time for the 5 year platinum edition or something.

Outside the occasional troll coming around, it's a ridiculously supportive and helpful community.
---
But outside a few specific subjects which are more controversial, I don't find this community to be particularly toxic.  We get people coming around asking for changes that are pretty widely regarded as a dead horse (mostly 'gimme more!' stuff), but other than that I find the place to be pretty nice and relatively free of problems.
---
Any idea what the legendary perk is called, or is it an unnamed secondary/tertiary perk?
---
Technically every weapon is good with bloodied as it pairs with Adrenaline Reaction, Nerd Rage and Bolstering Legendary Armor. 
---
HOWEVER
---
Anti-Armor is very nice for things with very low damage per shot. Like the Mini-Gun.
---
That‚Äôs one hell of a weapon!
---
I think the people who actually play the game do appreciate those things. It‚Äôs the so called ‚ÄúProfessionals‚Äù, the Youtubers, reviewers, online game writers and so on that don‚Äôt show it any love. Why? Because negativity gets clicks.
---
 Mr. Fuzzy is your friend, Mr. Fuzzy loves to play/ Mr. Fuzzy is your friend, Mr. Fuzzy loves to play/ Mr. Fuzzy is your friend, Mr. Fuzzy loves to play ........
---
I have a support build that uses Tenderizer Rank 3. Generally I can see it in action in Scorchbeast Queen battles. The moment I lay some fire down everyone else‚Äôs damage goes noticeably up. The last few weeks to a month it hasn‚Äôt seemed to be working at all.
---
I had an AA+LD that would move at 1500 - Ended up scriping it.
---
Even put the extra hook on it.
---
Yey. Call me when you get here!
---
Who signs off on it though?
---
Also, I haven't heard of this yet, but with how the game handles damage, I think using both the suppressor perk and legendary effect could make your target deal almost no damage.
---
I‚Äôve seen it lol. They got in trouble and refused to take it down. I think they threw the furniture out the lookout didn‚Äôt they?
---
I‚Äôve only been wanted like 3 times. Had to beg people to kill me all 3 times.
---
That‚Äòs amazing!!!
---
If they can make a sheepquatch adorable (and that plush IS adprable), I'm sure they can make a cute mole rat! Scorpions, maybe not so much. Bethesda! The gauntlet has been thrown down!
---
Survival was fun the first few weeks it was out but a lot of pve guys went in there for the extra xp, got wrecked and bitched about losing caps and aid. They fucked survival up anyways
---
Latest thinking is that the quest person needs to do the last shot that kills the cryptid to get completion. If you don‚Äôt, server drop and restart.
---
I.. did not know that, interesting. 
---
So you remove the rug from the blue print selection before creating it? Or do you blue print the whole thing then remove the rug after placing the blueprinted items down?
---
I think it's easy to test - you take pipe rifle, got to some big monster with a lot of HP and shoot few times without the perk, then switch to perk and shoot him again - probably best with VATS aiming in chest.
---
Not even close. The rate of fire is around 1.5 shots per second while almost every other gun is more than double that so even if most guns were to do only half the damage it would outperform it. Automatic weapons can get 15 times that as well so again, out performing it. I've played every build you can think of on my lvl 708 character and I'm speaking from experience. You just want to look like you know something special but you don't.
---
Exactly.
---
Do you have a source? If I remember correctly the algorithm is based on fallout 4, where there are diminishing returns for high DR, but no caps.
---
Here is the article that has some info:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance
---
This is why Reddit is funny, toxic pve players bitching about us raiders lol
---
Btw, I‚Äôve only been able to fix one of my toons with this problem by sprinting east on a slow server after clicking the centrifuge. If you get far enough away before the messages advance, the quest will auto complete
---
Is there a particular reason you would use a pipe rifle?
---
Don't you get a ton of pre war money from gov aid drops?
---
Lol yeah. Y'all wanna fuck with people who just eanna enjoy a game and *we're* toxic. You raider types are a fucking joke.
---
I guess Mr Griffith never wonders what he's even carving FOR. ;-) Side note: no mention at all that the house has been immortalized in a video game that is being sold worldwide?
---
You got downvoted because they didn't agree with you. That's really all you can know.
---
I‚Äôve used the armor on a lesser system without trouble.  I think I‚Äôve read someone saying it‚Äôs legacies in combination with the armor that causes the biggest freezing for others - never tried that combo.
---
Also didn‚Äôt use it for PvP.  Any idea if the other guy was using a legacy weapon as well when your system froze?
---
Yeah that's what i'm hoping for, I'm re-speccing form a vanguard build so it's taking a lot of levelling!
---
do you mean the farma pharma/scrounger/butcher's bounty "search" function?  like, you get the popup for a found item several moments after you've already searched? 
---
it got so bad for me on ps4 i unequipped those perks
---
Totally safe inside the hotel or bunker. In fact, the bunker has rad showers in case you accidentally step outside.
---
This quest only pops up every four days like all mire daily quests now
---
Nope. Black powder rifle is outperformed in every way by the majority of tangled weapons.
---
Except play time, that guest pops up like 6 times a day or more for me
---
I would say yes to a ton to offer. How many hours have you logged vs. the amount you paid?
---
And what "promises" were made specifically?
---
I haven't seen a failed event yet but rewards are always the same, I haven't gotten anything I didnt already have..
---
Do yourself a favor and block Yong Yea and his trash channel.
---
Life is better that way
---
Great concept and world design, poor execution in certain functions and polish
---
That‚Äôs a shame :/
---
Is this a PC only feature? I don't think I can add a Hazmat suit to my favorite wheel but I could be wrong.
---
On the day playtime is up, you can repeat it for that entire day
---
Me too, I think everyone's been killed by those borrowing little bastards! And thanks for saying that, been a bit down and out about it. I dont know what I'm going to do now, I dont want to PVP in adventure mode, feels bad attacking peaceful players.
---
I think that's roughly where I am as well, and that's that one of my arms isn't vanguard yet.  Honestly, I hadn't even looked at the totals until the other day when I was checking my mutations.  I had to do a double take on that.
---
Yes, finally proof of what I've been saying for ages.  Any explosive gauss is legendary and if someone claims otherwise they're trying to rip you off
---
So that's why I sometimes run across camps with vendors but they aren't on the map.
---
I've never had anywhere near the cap cap. lol
---
Nothing straw man about it. It is literally 25 years after a nuclear war, and the whole point is that yes people did try and survive in the aftermath, but they failed for various reasons - lack of resources, radiation, overabundance of predatory creatures - and either died or fled the region. Not much point in a game where you have to "reclaim the wasteland" if had already be reclaimed before you left the vault.
---
AA is overrated on melee weapons, but swing speed is perfect.
---
Bloodied and furious are great first effects.  Swing speed for the second is king, power attack damage is a ways behind but still good.  The 3rd effect is minor, but 1 str is what everyone wants (for the most part), though it is a really minor upgrade.
---
Oh defiantly but you have a lot of people traveling their for free to do primal cuts then they walk 10ft to stash/scrap equipment. After a primal event I have 3-4 people going around my camp.
---
Hahah nice fucker deserves it. So any bleed damage gun will do it huh? I got a harpoon gun with barbed harpoons that should do it?
---
Damn, i dont know what to think, the only option is to do the testing myself
---
nice
---
Maybe? On PC you can favorite it from insde your pipboy and it'll add it to the next open slot. Can't do it from the hotkey wheel.
---
Fallout 76 allows us to see new settings that would at most be shown in DLC. Never had a setting like the Ash Heap, Toxic Valley, or Cranberry Bog. The Mire and Savage Divide I'll give you, because they seem reminiscent of New Vegas and Far Harbor. Hell I don't even think we've had a setting as pretty as the Forest either
---
Must be a conflict between meat week and public events? That's all I can think that's different this time. It's been bad for me aswell, disconnects, enemy health regen, butcher's bounty taking fucking forever to decide if I get more meat. It's annoying.
---
I personally have been playing for a decent ammout of time and had fun with it for the most time. It can get stale walking through long distances to quests in unexplored areas, but besides that, i think there is a lot of to be had, but hey thats my opinion.
---
Your character is sneezing and farting at the same time. It's really off-putting and embarassing, so your character says "Oof!" I know I do.

Watch Todd at E3 again.
---
Hours played is different from ton to offer. People get invested even if theres nothing to do in hopes for future content. The game as it stands is boring and the "endgame" is stale/non-existant. All you do is farm for shit you don't really need while having 0 choices in this Fallout game. You set up a base, collect junk and kill stuff. Thats the "ton" the game has to offer.
---
I‚Äôm there daily
---
I'm glad you enjoyed it :)
---
I'm on PC.
---
I‚Äôve thrown away 4-5 of those 20w hammers. The easy one star legendaries that show up every two minutes in Primal Cuts are nice. Tons of scrip.
---
I bought a 10 MM SMG Prime Receiver from a vendor and it wasn't there when I went to Prime my 10 MM Max Capacity Piercing Fierce 10 MM SMG.
---
So true, don't get discouraged, get gud
---
I‚Äôm game for any meathook with a bump to swing speed! I have a few characters, but my bloodied guy would sure appreciate a bloodied + faster swing speed to stack with the base cards.
---
Pretty sure they patched the rug and campfire trick.
---
I have about 30. Rarely need to use them
---
Yep they stack
---
It‚Äôs one of the best cuts spots! Lots of good loot from honey beasts, the Hermit Crab has a legendary about half the time, right near a train station, and they spawn pretty well. Ash Heap is also okay because you get a guaranteed legendary from the Sheepsquatch, but the animals are much more annoying.
---
Doesn't ultracite .44 use roughly the same amount of resources as ultracite .45?
---
Ive been using mine on armor or weapons when i found out they take up inventory space
---
Since when is having 30000 caps a problem? Do like we do in real life: lock and key or reinvest it into the economy. My digital wallet that never goes over 6k would appreciate business from bitchy-mister-moneybags over here.
---
The first time I did the soldier one I figured,"Well, it requires a shovel so there must be one around to use. Why wouldn't there be." Why indeed. I'm not keeping a shovel in my stash for the odd moment this event pops up. Still haven't completed it, lv 136.
---
Ok. Many people disagree, and thats why I barely see 8 people in a server at any given time.
---
I havent been able to confirm that. I can confirm that the healing given from friendly fire is pretty damn good, but if youre ever using a flamer, \*don't\* hold down the trigger. Use it like a semi auto weapon, you'll miss less shots, do the same damage, and save a tonne on ammo. 
---

It really is amazing.
---
He really must have a Mr Handy to light them all up. Holy...
---
If you play with friends, maybe offer to fix up their stuff with the kits as well.
---
Agreed, color changes would be great.
---
Bloodied and junkies are great weapons, all comes down to the weapon though, I usually avoid explosive weapons as fire rate is King right now, however a gun like the lmg has such fast fire you might as well get explosive on that one or a minigun, for a handmade fire rate is amazing
---
Aside from the expected reliability (which *is* an issue, though not something I suffer from), the only complaint I have is with the amount of content.  There's plenty, but there could be more.  
---
Once you reach a certain point, there's pretty much trading, and running the same events over and over.  For most people will hit the wall after 150-200 hours tops, which isn't bad.  But for an online multiplayer game, that needs to be bumped up, and probably will be over time.
---
Love this. Thank you.
---
The only things that I have problems with in the wasteland are Mirelurk Kings and Queens. That poison just annihilates me lol  one of my pieces has 25 RR so that helps a little. Plus 5 from my vault 76 jumpsuit
---
What are you saying?
---
"If you aren't a mod leave it alone, like your sex life, blah blah blah"
---
\-or-
---
"How about nobody likes a know it all or snitch, like your sex life, blah blah blah"
---
Because either way, what you just said makes no fuckin sense and I now hate the fact that you exist.
---
Plants have been designed\\drawn out - so they are coming eventually but... there is no meshes yet - so not soon
---
Huh?
---
This the only game where when wandering around with friends actually feels like an rpg.
---
This sadly.
---
Offering to repair your friends armor/weapons or maybe even other players would make a nice use of those extra repair kits.
---
The unpowered one should have a water pump
---
Build walls around them, build a specific ‚Äúat max caps‚Äù room for your vendors when you are at max caps, just a tip
---
What?
---
Because it wasn't very well executed. Good ideas in theory don't make a good game /world in practice. I'll just take your example sentence.
---
There is no great incentive for those 24 players to meet or team up (and considering how drops work, it can even be detrimental to fight together - for example if someone oneshoots a legendary, denying you the loot) , talking between them is limited to a microphone which not every (PC) player has or uses or can use. Trading is tedious and (this is due to the players themselves I'll admit)pricing is way off (players demanding prices that can only be paid using alt chars).
---
Tldr: yes, 24 players on a server is great. However, there are quite some difficulties in playing together and no incentive to do so.
---
One thing I have been thinking of is rebuilding my camp to be a meat week structure.   Wide two story with a bunch of turrets on the wings and stash with work stations in the back.  No walls and nothing on the main floor.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04TIdKscwbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04TIdKscwbI)
---
Think they already did with that vault raid armor set. Btw, PAs are very powerful endgame. It's on par with normal armors even without any legendary effect.
---
yeah, on top of underarmor, which makes complete sense, not on top of more armor
---
Can you please let me know if this works?
---
Bloodied is good because its the most reliable method of dealing high damage to any target for 3 reasons:  
---
1- It's among the highest scaling legendaries, period.  Pretty much only instigating can compare at its best, and that's not going to help vs the queen for example.  
---
2- The playstyle that uses these weapons synergizes well with other perks and legendary effects like unyeilding armor/serendipity/radicool/etc.  The benefits to these builds are numerous to say the least.  
---
3- As far as real damage calculation goes (not what's shown in the pip-boy) high damage per hit yields higher actual damage output than perks that reduce armor.  This makes bloodied better than anti armor for every weapon that you can manage using at low hp and outside of pvp.
---
Thats the tricky part though...telling someone yo drop your be handmade real quick and ill fix it..haha no one will ever do that nonsense
---
The world design is great, much nicer than the Boston wasteland, but the game is getting laggier and more unstable with every patch lately!
---
Again killing someone‚Äôs cow should get a bounty, same as destroying someone‚Äôs camp
---
cool, that community is also literally the smallest active online community, of course it isn't going to be full of griefers.
---
Thanks, I didn't know that.
---
Yeah,  I started being forced to use them just because of weight issues.  Also get them from the Raids and Project Paradise too
---
Maybe her legendary heal phase got bugged? Either way, interesting bug.
---
It would be cool if they also just store the caps after you are max
---
My favorite FT glitch is when I spawn into a nuke zone and take no damage, but as soon as I travel to the "edge" I get hit for like +65 rads/sec and die.
---
Using it in power armour with the dynamo torso mod is pretty decent.
---
I agree that damage resistance caps and damage output caps are absolute trash but let's not act like assassin sentinel armor is godly. Because people cried about it so much it's barely better than wearing non legendary armor now.
---
If making sense is what it's all about, then why not normal armors? As I said, there's plenty of space inside PA. Might not fit some bulky marine armors or trapper armors but we surely can do leathers. Immersion bro
---
Because the rest of the game is absolute garbage
---
Anyone can play the anecdote game. I play in full servers all the time.
---
Because for everything you has stated you don‚Äôt see as an issue.. has effected somebody else and they see as an issue.. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è this game is amazing but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not plague ridden in bugs and controversy
---
If you want to remain an in game peasant with mediocre gear go right ahead buddy.
---
Yow gwai
---
I wish I had one to sell!  I've run myself out of high end weapons to deal (I may have a mid-god-tier .50 laying around still).  Bloodied swing speed would hit my vendor near the 25K mark.

And before anyone complains about the price, I've sold plenty of weapons at that tier for ~20-25K, and they disappear fast since most people won't sell them at all and only take trades.  Everyone wants a great weapon cheaper, but if the 5 guys in line behind you will pay 25K, I'm not likely to cut you a deal at 10K.
---
okay, I get the people of all shapes argument, but for real, there is no room, just look at the PA frame, it's like the MkI Iron Man suit, NO ROOM
---
NPCs have pronounced it in the game several times tho
---
Shall I google 'fo76 bos paint plan' for you, or are you able to do it yourself? ;-) There's a number of paints still waiting, Knight CPT is one of the first. And Yes to your second question, the way to farm a specific plan from that list is to **not** learn it (and put it in your stash, to be sure, don't keep it in your inventory).
---
Now I‚Äôm in the mountains next to white springs. I get a TON of traffic there.  I build a barn just for my vending machines and I have a door that I lock when I‚Äôm maxed and I then disconnect 1 wire that‚Äôs coming through a wall conduit and it kills the power. Very easy, very efficient. If someone stumbles spin my camp (since there is no icon without power) they will have to lock pick my gate and become wanted to get access and I have yet to have this happen even once. Although it would be sweet if we had an option on our pip boy to turn off vending machines or maybe like a wireless kill switch that you can in turn hook up to your vending set up. I had the anxiety of haven‚Äôt to drop everything to rush back when I hit 27k in hopes they don‚Äôt buy anything else and set me over!!!

We can clearly see who the asshole is by the amount of salt produced by an honest answer to your question

Three Dog says is best on the radio in Fallout 3:

---
No, it's just all my weapons would kill to fast to repeat shot eanough times.
---
Yogi. Like yogi bear. Jk, it‚Äôs yow gwai
---
&gt;AA is overrated on melee weapons,
---
It's a 28% Damage buff, yes there is better out there. I may not be top 3, but it's still a good/ decent 1st prefix
---
You know you‚Äôre comparing full auto weapons to a 1 shot weapon. Completely different category, build and way to use it. If you‚Äôre going to hate on BP stuff at least keep it in the sniping family of weapons. A handmade is trash in comparison to a .50 cal. You guys are trying too hard to say they are trash than finding how to make it viable. There lies why you think they are trash.
---
I honestly think they brought it back as counter-programming to Borderlands 3 dropping. The player counts i see make me cynical that this player base actually killed all those  SB's to earn this 'reward'.
---
Look up a YouTube video of 3 dog on GNR. He says "don't feed the yao guai" for your helpful wasteland advice.
---
I still don't understand why/how the Alien Blaster synergized so well with the Strangler PA.
---
No, I dont have any, I am not sure how to farm them. I though they only dropped at treasure hunts that I dont enjoy doing.
---
Well, there are smaller maps on the way (Charleston map has been datamined), so maybe we could get to see that in the future. Would be nice.
---
You legit had me for a sec
---
I had the same problem. All ya got to do is log back in and join a new server. Worked fine for me.
---
Thank you kind man..
---
gunpowder probably
---
There IS a room. A single suit can fit people of all sizes and sex. How the hell does that happen if there's no room?
---
The downvotes coming from you and other says enough, but I'll bite. If you have been paying attention over the last year or more, you know that for bethesda, a rushed product and a timed one are the same. Just see the rushed PA fix, and the not rushed mess that was some of the  bugged new features that arrived at 76. 76 was also a game that was not  "rushed", and involved most of the all team at Bethesda. They are just incompetent.
---
And like I said in another comment, it's my account privacy and security. I want it now, not on a arbitrary date. I am tired of receiving e-mails from then on suspicious activity on my account and my girlfriend's. It's enough.
---
Depending on what rank of adrenaline I have slotted, average damage varies, but it ranges from 500s to 1000s (glowing), no chems. Just gotta watch out; you can't take hits like you would unless you've got a couple if not more bolstering items on. I don't, but then I rely on 4 pieces of unyielding to push perception and agility to higher numbers. Makes for better use of sneak and vats so I can be lazy about it.
---
This kinda already exist, there is a pvp event for this , though it should restrict you to those weapons
---
100% agree with this.
---
Try the house north of Camden park, it has the fancy roach sitting on the toilet, "Roachy", I think there should be a can in there as its roachy's son.
---
All of mine came from queen killing.
---
No. Even from long range its outperformed by automatic weapons. No matter what you say it's out DPSed by most other rifles full auto or not long range or no.
---
I use them on my hazmat suit. It's the only way to "over repair" it now.
---
A small house near monongah station where one of the overseer caches are, too floor of westek and Bolton greens. Three places I know of.
---
Yow gwai, the way it's supposed to be pronounced.
---
I think you would be the most helpful asking low levels if they need help repairing their armor/weapons, but I get what you're saying and it probably would make you sound sketchy to people. Only other option I see would be scrapping them though.
---
I don't know. I got a bloodied 5.56 assault rifle from a 3* in Watoga. It explodes for area damage. 
---
I can't figure out how to make the best of this gun. I put an automatic receiver on it but the damage doesn't seem too high. I can kill high levels with 2 shotgun shells. It takes too long with this gun. Especially with 10 ghouls are beating on you. Maybe making it auto was a mistake? I don't have all the rifle perks yet, maybe that will help.
---
Good luck. I just came back after a long break and am still getting caught back up.
---
Wow how are you people getting maxed out with caps? I struggle to stay at around 5k
---
I bet he knows... I also bet he gets more people dressed in Fallout gear taking selfies!...lol
---
Maybe, but I have 2,3k+ ultracite .45 I wanted to use, while I have 0 ultracite .44, so I'll need to craft.
---
I think they should implement something into this Public Event to make it less RNG. Reducing the Public Event's cooldown from 40 mins to 20 mins won't fix the actual issue. Not mention that they will add more events into the event's pool for future updates.
---
I'm suggesting an event token. For every event you've completed you'll be rewarded a token. Collect enough token; let's say 10 token... you can brute force spawn any event you want with the token.
---
This or to my ears
---
Yow Gwhy
---
Agree, and it frees up some perks.  I think the consensus is that you'll do better with a different effect and use the perk, but certainly AA is a useful effect.
---
(I'm not melee, so I'm just repeating what I've heard based on really crappy memory, so feel free to correct if any of that is wrong)
---
'bear'
---
Bethesda should make him a prop with a witches hat for his yard!
---
It's actually quite easy to solo. Just run a lap around the site collecting all the greens (~20) and dump them in the stash all at once. Then get to killing critters until you got around 30 and dump these all at once again and the Event should be finished.
---
&gt;have one point in each iron first level so youd get 30% damage increase not 20%
---
Thank you for posting this. I just started unlocking rifleman perks for my build and completely forgot about this life hack.
---
Hunter hunted isn't the same. Im talking about 52 people firing off muskets like mad men. It's like 1 in the chamber but funnier because you really gotta hit your shot and you'd be panicking every time you missed or got hit.
---
because they aren't one size fits all, they are one size fits most.  are you confused because of how bulky it appears?  the armor is fitted to a frame, the frame itself is just large enough to hold an adult human in a body suit, like for real, there is no armor set in the game that looks remotely small enough to fit in that frame.  am I being trolled right now?!?!!
---
I hope not, it's a special fallout 4 weapon used by the minutemen. Doesn't belong here, loads of weapons dont belong here.
---
Broadsider,
---
Cryolator,
---
Radium rifle,
---
Maybe tesla gun, not sure if that's just a robot part.
---
But it doesn't feel right, seeing something out of context like that.
---
It's bigger than this one, 284K members.  It's gained a lot of popularity since the game has improved so much with recent updates.
---
i know where that is! dont remember seeing that tin there but will check it out later. thanks for the info!
---
That's for you to decide  
---
~~Yes they are very much dead, a raiders gotta eat~~
---
Yes, you can. Although maybe it's a pattern, as my secondary char only ever got rewarded one plan as of yet, whereas my main is able to somewhat consistently farm them.
---
Oh, it doesn't, it still sucks and is a very medicore choice for Strangler PA.
---
The thing is, it doesn't matter. The strangler PA bonus is so extreme that even with a weapon that doesn't deal damage you can run around pewpewpewing godly-armored people like they were low level scorched.
---
It‚Äôs 1 shot. Stop looking in terms of DPS. That‚Äôs why you have this idea it‚Äôs no good. BP and DPS shouldn‚Äôt be in the same sentence because it isn‚Äôt a DPS gun. It‚Äôs a damage per round weapon. Just like every sniper rifle.
---
yea, but given where it sends you, by the time you are capable of finishing that part of roses quest, the armor is pretty much useless (at least for me)
---
I completed part 1 of Roses quest at L55, and still use the weapon.
---
But when I completed the last part of her quest several levels later - the PA was L15.
---
Didn't take up space in my stash for long.
---
This game does t care about lore so it wouldn't bother me.
---
Yea this is wrong for so many reasons. Restocking the same stuff is NOT part of the game. Killing power should do the trick but doesn‚Äôt for whatever reason. And it‚Äôs so easy to make caps on these things it‚Äôs almost comical. You can literally sell any legendary item as long as it‚Äôs fair priced and you want caps instead of a couple scrip. If your asking 1500 for a auto stim leather chest piece you‚Äôll never get any business.
---
Nice try sheep
---
28 STAB WOUNDS!
---
Don't feed the Yao Guai. That is all.
---
That's a lazy response, 2 wrongs don't make a right.
---
Yow!-guy!
---
Good idea
---
AA is a strange one.
---
There are claims that it neuters Tank Killer and Stabilized perks to 50% value but nothing mentioned against the likes of Incisor, perhaps why you seem to be getting poor value for it being non-melee?
---
Yeah. That was fucking weird. 
---
If it was roleplay than the character shouldn't be making references to the out of universe friends list. And its super fucking creepy that someone would want (or even have a thought to) play a stalker rapist. 
---
If it was meant as a joke way to laugh at the friends list bug, than that is some super cringe humor. 
---
Either way it just fucking weird. 
---
No wonder nobody wants to join up on a team with random strangers
---
will check those places out. is this coffee tin a static spawn or does it share a spawn with other junk items?
---
Instead of an Atom Shop thing, the Pint-Sized Slasher outfit and knife should have been an all-melee top tier reward for a NW mode.
---
Ammunition. 5.56 sells like crazy I can max my caps in one day.
---
I have all the mods but no tenderizer. Ha
---
Actually come to think of it Strangler PA MAKES your farts deadly.
---
I shoot my mate in the head from 3 meters distance, using Bloodied Explosive combat rifle. He did not react, but his armor farted. I died, he did not.
---
I think I only have 1 rank of adrenaline atm.
---
You mention 4 pieces of unyielding, what is the other piece you wear?
---
I had someone buy some ammo from my vending machine and then shoot up my camp trashing most of it.
---
I have seen it where my turrets just don't do anything when some enemy spawns nearby.
---
There are 4 others you can get from Lowes Taxidermy.
---
I hover around 50 (slightly lower right now).  I hit up the queen whenever it's up, though I don't pull her myself.  And I repair almost everything with them.
---
I run stealth commando and 5x weaponsmith, so I don't get hit all that much and my guns last a while, both of which help a lot.
---
Damage per round doesn't matter if its outperformed in every other way by other guns. If you can shoot a super mutant twice in 3 seconds and kill it but I can shoot it 15 times in 1 second and kill it then my gun outperformed yours. That's it. Its fact.
---
Glad it's not up to you then! 
---
Anyway we'll see, perhaps if they add minutemen into wastelanders we might see it return.
---
It's not lazy, its true.  This game has thrown lore and the timeline put the window so I'm going to enjoy it for the mess that it is.
---
  I wanted to paint the Action Hero too and when I found I couldn't I logged a ticket.  Seven days later and I'm still going round in circles with their "customer support".
---
  I've been told that because it's a "unique" item it can't be painted; that doesn't explain Acceptable Overkill, Daisycutter, etc all being painted.
---
  I was asked to submit umpteen screenshots to back up what I was saying, which I did and they've been duly ignored.
---
  At one point I was even told that because I was having "problems with a quest" I had logged a wrong ticket, and they helpfully provided me with a link to log a quest problem.
---
  So no, not a big fan of Bethesda's "customer support".  Had the description in the Atom Shop said the paint COULDN'T be applied to unique named legendaries then I would have reconsidered my purchase decision.
---
New items in Atom store.
---
I see what you did there.  
---
All kidding aside, that‚Äôs a damn good song.
---
I get that, in the end it‚Äôs all about supply and demand. If a player demands a rare weapon for a build then the sky is the limit. I‚Äôve been on the hunt for a faster fire rate explosive and/or bloodied radium rifle. Armor-wise, it‚Äôd be killer to acquire 4 pieces of unyielding sentinel ‚Äî but everyone wants that or cav so I never see it.
---
Same here. I was hoping for an update and datamining would reveal some more information on the Halloween events and possibly upcoming Halloween atom shop items
---
It's flexible enough to fit my skimpy female character and then my large muscular male character. Why does it have to be suddenly impossible when it comes to armor size? Enlighten me please.
---
I just read the post and watched the video. It was rather awesome how Bethesda helped make the large-sized P.E.R.K. 
---
cards for the scavenger hunt. It's the little things like that that put a smile on a face and warm my heart. I 
---
enjoyed watching the scavenger hunt as well, as it definitely shows how much thought and planning you had put into 
---
this, which is pretty darn amazing.
---
You two look amazing together, both in and out of the Wasteland. Here's to many more adventures in your life.
---
Also, I have to ask... do you both play on PC, or on console?
---
Switchblades no armor... street fight style...lol
---
It's simply server maintenance and a stability patch, notes are unlikely.
---
It's already in the dev room so I'm sure well get it. We already have Preston Garvey's coat so no difference. If it were up to me the game would have been lore friendly so I don't k how what you're glad about.
---
I put in a ticket and got my Atoms back, plus I still have the skin unlocked. Maybe ask for refund
---
Haha gotta line up and take our turns too. I‚Äôll have you know, I‚Äôm not hiding in the woods with a bright red suit on tho.

I paid $60 at launch and personally feel that I even gotten more than my money's worth out of it.

You can build a switch on your power line, it's what I do, or put a pc on it

---
I'd like to see them expand NW to offer various PvP modes where yiu don't have your legendaries or adventure mode gear. Bring on Team Deathmatch in The Palace of the Winding Path, or Capture the Flag at Harper's Ferry.
---
I really like the sound of your idea though, you could have The Dragon and a highly reduced damage Gatling Gun as Halo-style power weapons.
---
Stalking is a crime.
---
Im going to have to find that again and build my camp near it.
---
Make it a haunted house.
---
you can't go by reddit members, that only accounts for a portion of any given community, GTA Online reddit only has half a mil subs but the game gets literally millions of players daily.  also our community killed over 600,000 scorchbeasts in A WEEK, even at one per player that's a good chunk, but it's probably closer to 12 to 1, meaning we could have more than 7 million players, that's a lot, but let's do a conservative estimate of 4 players per SB killed, that's still over 2 and a half million players.  No Man's Sky Steam charts show little activity, peak player count hasn't come close to 100,000 since it's first month, I know that's just Steam but it doesn't bode well
---
Did Beth say so anywhere other than the loading screen?
---
But you both killed it.
---
End result is the same. You got to have fun using your gun, don't shit on someone else for using theirs.
---
The game is about having fun, not putting out the biggest number. We should focus on that, not this e-peen measuring contest.
---
Just go have fun!
---
So when I first saw it I thought it was a play on Yogi, so I pronounce it that way and it‚Äôs stuck with me even though I know it is wrong.
---
Nuclear Winter already has it so that you don't have your legendaries or any gear for that matter.
---
Appalachia is pretty awesome, but that doesn't make up for the failures and meh aspects of 76. 
---
The gameplay is basically just FO4 on repeat (which is fine but doesn't inspire praise), the atom shop started out ok but has largely become a pile of dogshit, the game's rewards are actually much fewer than FO4 in terms of cosmetics, there are no difficulty controls, Bethesda mislead everyone calling new content 'dungeons' and 'raids' when neither of them are dungeons or raids in any reasonable sense, we're still waiting on any clear information about private servers or mods, most people are still doing the same things they did when the game launched nearly one year ago, performance is still an issue for many folks (though not all), and bugs are clearly an ongoing problem.
---
In essence, there's still a great platform waiting for us with Appalachia, but Bethesda has done very little to make good use of that platform. I played for months after launch and then forced myself to stop because I didn't want to waste this awesome world on the mediocre challenge and lacking cosmetic rewards. 
---
This game will probably not be worth praise until mods and private servers arrive, since those things can fix just about every major issue with the game right now. Assuming Bethesda doesn't do something really stupid and try to sell us mods at stupid prices (they probably will).
---
they should totally do some Halloween event that involves Trick or Treating to different camps!
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/367072/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-october-1-2019/2?language%5B%5D=en
---
At a guess or do you have some insider info?
---
Because the bugs ruin it yet people applaud them for IDENTIFYING the bugs not fixing them. Bugs that would take a talented modder who knows the creation engine like the back of his hand a week to fix seems to take Bethesda months.
---
I repair anything when it creeps down towards the 100% condition mark.  I'll keep 10 on hand for an imaginary rainy day that will likely never come, but the rest I use frivolously.  They take up 0.1w, so hoarding them is not a great idea.
---
Am I bad for hoping it would be "Yo Guy"?
---
That's what I mean, it makes it way more fun. It's why I've always gone back to Halo as everyone starts with the same weapons, none of the CoD shit where people who've played the longest shit on the newbies.
---
Way better than the tiny Fallout 4 world.
---
Just fast travel to a place and go back after this. It‚Äôs simple but works for me every time. Not joking.
---
Use them more often. Going into battle the queen? top off your armor/weapon durability. Putting a weapon up for sale/trade? use one. Have more than 50? repair everything that is below max.
---
Jesus this turned into a shit show of numbers and calculations about who's numbers are bigger and better.
---
Shit, can't we just have another choice in the game for a weapon and let some people have some damn fun around here?
---
It¬¥s not like people don¬¥t enjoy playing the game. I genuinely enjoy it when I occasionally play FO76 and I have a good laugh when I see a bug or a broken animation. It also makes for very funny photos. Also this game has a very good community.
---
However, this game has received a lot of bad reviews and hate and the truth is that most of it was deserved, but taken and made into extreme proportions. And also media loves to talk trash about it. First because trashing FO76 will get you more attention/likes/views than praising it and also because Bethesda sometimes break their promises. (For example with items in the atomic shop that give a gameplay advantage)
---
Also, let¬¥s be honest, every game gets only one first impression. And first impression of this game...wasn¬¥t exactly breathtaking. But hey, the game is still improving and if Bethesda wants, they can make this game really good. FF XIV, No man¬¥s sky etc shows that game can become very good given enough time. I myself am waiting for the winter update.
---
First of all I never shat on anyone. Second the result is NOT the same because the resulting ttk is vastly different. Third, I already said it might be fun to use but its not really viable as a main weapon. Lastly, some people's idea of fun IS pumping out the highest DPS possible.
---
okay, because of it's design, let's say the frame is adjustable, you still want it adjusted as tight as possible for it to be functional, too many bulky layers between you and the frame would not only cause discomfort but would hinder movement, plus it's fucking redundant, who wears armor OVER MORE ARMOR?!  I swear I am being trolled rn...
---
Cool thnx, so no download, just some downtime.
---
New items are always added with Tuesday maintenance. What they are though is anyone's guess.
---
But then you gotta spend annoyingly long and laggy pipboy menu time re-equipping Unyd armor after u get out ofthe NZ and hope u dont die again to some add b4 u do. Unless bethesda decided to implement armor loadouts we can hotkey like we all have been asking for since forever... my go to until then is just spam diluted radaway as soon as i load in and again on the edge until im back to 20%.
---
Nope.
---
I didn't attack anyone, the guy came here trying to claim it was the highest damage gun and I told him he was wrong. My post was supposed to be just asking for the laser musket.
---
Yep.
---
Fastnacht was way better imo
---
I run tank killer, and my prefix of choice is instigating, so it's not something I've worried about too much.  I've used AA before, but not deeply analyzed it.  For normal mobs, 1-2 hits to dead outweighs other things.
---
Since I'm commando, when I run SBQ I generally swap to a gimped heavy weapon 'build', but it's a mess and nowhere near ready to optimize.
---
So follow up question.  I have initiated and CPT.  I do FK about 6 times a day and never get paint.  Did I screw something up by learning those two out of order?
---
Well yeah and I do as long as the PA still carries a slight advantage over everything else given the work to acquire it. I think that would be fair.
---
It's not ideal but preferable to eternal damnation in a nuke zone. Spamming radaway works too.
---
gweilo
---
Yep, same as FO4.
---
All of my renamed stuff have been prefixed with "- " for a while now.
---
Like 
---
\- Foo Foo
---
\- Attenborough
---
\- Suit
---
\- Left Leg
---
etc, etc
---
I know. We love playing Halo MCC for this. Looking forward to Halo Infinite which will bring split-screen back.
---
On some armor pieces it will change the name to "Poisoner's" but most of the time it is just listed as one of the effects "+25 Poison Resistance."
---
I spent all my caps on X01 plans the other day and less than 24hrs later was at 12,000 caps again. I just dropped prices on a lot of my legendary items for same and maxed my daily vendor limit. I keep my machines stocked with plans and clothing at good prices. Constant sales.
---
You need the commando perks, nerd rage, and adrenal reaction just to start with, then at 20% health you'll see the best out of this weapon.
---
The diner next to clarsburg shooting club has a skeleton at a picnic table out back that's wearing a hat very close to Nick's.
---
Call it how you want it scrub, y'all pve guys only want limits on everything cuz you get wrecked by everything lol
---
its not weird at all.. people who makes youtube videos/streams are just idiots...
---
24 people? I have yet to see a full server on PC EU, or even close to full.
---
Are you seriously saying you think the game sold well?
---
It's the wasteland, enjoy the danger, not a farming simulator, the second you bought this game you signed up for pvp
---
I thought that but it looked brown, might be the lighting
---
There‚Äôs a new dupe glitch involving meat cleavers and mines that I suspect has been taking its toll.
---
I camped that event for 17 hours straight and literally all I got was Tato Salad and Bloody Chef Hats. No plans, no outfits, no Tenderizer. I camped the first meat week for 12 hours and I got the same shit. If Bethesda is going to make getting good rewards this hard, they can‚Äôt be mad about people duping.
---
Like I said word of mouth that's why I'm asking lola
---
This is a stellar idea!
---
Where do I find these roleplayers? Junkie Jenny my Drug addicted Raider could use the doctors helpüòÇ
---
"Nice"
---
Its the same g as in gigantic
---
In mandarin language it means "demon"
---
I agree it was op before now it's only ok, I mean that in a way of having those added effects PLUS about the same Dr and ER as pa
---
Just curious I've never participated because I'm not a melee build...is there anything good to get besides the Tenderizer???
---
&gt; Once you reach a certain point, there's pretty much trading, and running the same events over and over.
---
I was already there for a while when the 76 hours popup showed up.
---
That was my point dear Giraffe who games.
---
It's just a laser musket. It should be added to the game, for fun, who cares about the numbers... Well I do, but not as much as someone else having fun.
---
I feel bad for everyone jumping at your post like savages lol.
---
Awesome man thank you. I'll check it out tonight after work!
---
"Commie bear"
---
Don't use the Bethesda launcher and start the game from the exe file, that should fix it.
---
Yow gwhy
---
Lol.
---
I‚Äôm wanting these mods for the tenderizer!!! Or what‚Äôs this bbq plan I heard someone say? Also yea people are baited my people for pvp after the event! Had a guy join n my team to do a trade (set up on reddit) and he engages someone that was an obvious bait job and got me smoked in the the process costing me my junk! Specially because I keep pacifist mode on. I wasn‚Äôt happy at all and I‚Äôm half way convinced the guy set me up to lose my junk. I was salty to say the least.
---
Yes whenever the gamma came out I had to find cover to fight from.
---
I have about 25 on me, havent done Queen runs in a while.
---
But 400, how much weight do you have on you? lol
---
Well I suppose you have problem with wearing armor over underarmor then? And if tightness is your problem, you can always adjust your PA to your armor. I really don't understand why you have problem with this
---
Maybe for you
---
Bashing works- you don't have to shoot them and use ammo. For stuff like the plasma gun challenge where ammo is cost/resource prohibitive this is great.
---
lol I can't believe I'm about to discuss fo76's lore, this'll be a first!
---
Reclaim the wasteland motto has no relevance to scorched plague or communities wiped as a whole as it was coined back in 207something and fo4 minuteman literally reclaims the wasteland too so lets just skip that part. Holotapes and notes clearly state that if fellers back in Enclave bunker could just sit still;
---
a) Responders were making progress and did claim many parts of the Forest region
---
b) Raiders were thriving, apart from lucrative raiding and stuff, they were operating freak shows, cinemas and whole other fun things
---
c) Free states literally had a libertarian paradise going on back in Harper's Ferry with bustling trade and stuff
---
d) BoS was BoS because of scorched I guess (I really am not sure) but we at least know there was a military group armed to teeth with PAs and miniguns
---
and WV was not directly hit by nukes, they even have a forest region man. They were doing just fine with respect to other states in Fallout lore. They did not try to survive, they survived, and game shows a crystal clear picture that they did amazingly fine especially compared to 3 and 4 after the war. Environmental design and the general theme of the game clearly builds up to an unavoidable tragedy for the factions involved, a tragedy that could be averted if Scorched were not formed.
---
People survived MANY years after the war in California, Nevada, Arizona, Boston, Washington, Pittsburgh, Maine etc the only place that got wiped out was WV and that was because of Enclave's bright idea to create a DEFCON 1 status here in Appalachia. Sure, nuclear war made life really fucking hard (thus "lack of resources, radiation, overabundance of predatory creatures") but it is not what ended it here in Appalachia, it was a huge bat.
---
Yep did it on my alt last night. Got 2 drops of 200 each off 2 mobs then another 100 in the final box.
---
Or... a large part of the server population on when the "week" started have differing schedules/time constraints as the week wears on.
---
yeah it sure was, first time I had seen that one....
---
Going off of this even other themed fight modes would be cool. Like power armor laser weapons for brotherhood of steel, plasma weapons and mutations for enclave, raider style weapon and chems. Like if they just restricted items to follow a theme I think itd be pretty cool.
---
Crimson is easy to buy. Went looking around and had 30 by end of the day for ultracite fusion cells. Tho now this gun is the hot new thing may have to Look harder.
---
Sorry, your Highness, in all your uniquely special glory of having found a TSE and three Cavalier pieces. Any gear that doesn't have the potential to grief someone be damned! This makes anyone a better player without a doubt! Quests and Challenges are for peasants to fret with! And when the time comes for a problem to be addressed, call upon the mighty advisors of Reddit to remind you of DOORS!
---
Well, if this damnable bug ever gets squashed or the game just magically slides it through, I'm PC, TOO. Maybe I'll catch you in the wasteland. If you see a creeper with binoculars, it's just me. Keeping my distance. Don't want to break your heart again üòâ
---
Its 40 pounds of stash thats why its gettin to me now. Wish i could just give em away
---
Rhymes with
---
'how why'
---
More money More problems.
---
I say it like, yaw gwhy
---
Awesome idea which unfortunately means it will never actually happen. Bethesda doesn't care enough to come up with ideas like this.
---
Not at all.. I made an assumption. And I was right! They've added faction specific skins for the pip boy, even though they weren't around before the war... vault tec didnt make a raider scabber pip boy... lol. So bethesda could just add a skin that also included a flashlight mod.. sure that changes the device slightly, but I hardly think that matters considering all of the new items they've been putting in the atom shop.. I'm merely trying to point out that just because it wasnt already in the game, or a previous game, that it can* be lore friendly if they add it in a way that makes it lore friendly
---
This is exactly it.
---
can fix power armor also if you use that
---
That's pretty cool.
---
&gt; Especially the prime meat event when I'm drumming
---
You only have to actually play the drum for a second or so at the very beginning of the event to call the beasts.  After that, the waves will just come on their own without any need for further drumming
---
Your options are settlers or raiders.
---
Join the raiders, we have skeleton altars to the Wise Mothman!
---
I‚Äôm using yogi from now on.
---
you just don't get it, as tight as you would be able to adjust it there would still be slippage and it wouldn't be comfortable or functional.  I am fine with wearing what was intended to be worn under it, but not regular armor, IT IS ALL BULKy.  it's like you have never played this game before, robot armor pieces are literally bigger than some PA pieces
---
The best I could do for Halloween was collect plastic pumpkins to put in display cases
---
Gotcha! Thanks for the info! üëç
---
I had it drop from a scorchbeast a few weeks ago.
---
when i click on play i get this error, also i have tried to join a friend and i get the same error message
---
That's pretty cool. I usually drop stuff near Vault 76 if I happen see a new player at the door. Just helping out when I can.
---
I want that F:NV player icon.
---
I shall be stalking you too. May the best stalker win.

The suppressor perk works against most opponents but the better players stack their damage output so high that they can get the full 110 damage on you no matter what you‚Äôre running.

Radscorpion plushies! Made from polyester stuffing and pure nightmare.

If you haven't made a gauntlet/ninja build, they're fun.  You can [kill a scorchbeast in one hit](https://youtu.be/x3-4ji5GxcA).
---
Ok I‚Äôm kind of lost. What is the effect of the new PA? I get you squire the steel from the raid and then craft it but then what? You buy those modules from the purveyor and apply them? What is the effect given? Thanks in advance.
---
(Those are two different g‚Äôs....)
---
hi man I knew it was a good idea to turn that convo we had to a thread, I hope beth sees it this time lol!
---
It's sold 2.46 million units. How many groups of 24 can you make out of that?
---
YouTubers and the gaming press get clicks both by reaffirming the biases of people who decided it's terrible and riling up supporters who want to know how their opinions are wrong. Badmouthing 76 is a win-win for them among haters and fans alike.
---
Okay, except no I didn't sign up for PvP? World of Warcraft doesn't force you into PvP, and War is in the name. Destiny has plenty for PvE and PvP. Plenty of online games have plenty for both types of players.
---
If *you* want nothing but ~the chance to harass people~ "PvP", go play Rust or some shit, *scrub*.
---
Maybe? I just went and looked again. I still think it's the greaser stuff, but now I'm second guessing myself.
---
Fast travel to a farm and harvest
---
I only have melons at my herbivore camps, nothing at carnivores. Too irritating.

I used to have an adhesive farm at one, but no more.

You are a complete village idiot. You totally missed the point of the thread. Anyway peasant jog on.

I‚Äôm not talking about hunter hunted, go to the fort and talk to the robots, unless they patched it out

probably should have put a poll up. =P

Try trading what you have for ult.44. If they both use the same amount of resources you should be able to make a 1:1 trade. Unfortunately, ult.44 is not widely used.
---
Another thing you can do is trade your ult.45 for ult.44 resources.
---
But with Deathclaws... they need to rise up and start hunting Wastelanders...ha!

---
Yes. That's why I specifically mentioned leather armors. They are not bulky at all and if you take a look at light version of leather armor, it really doesn't add all that much to your underarmor. I'm not stupid I ain't saying we should be able to wear marine armor and PA on top. I'm talking about leather armors
---
I'll check this out! I don't think I have that ability on PS4, but I hope this works.
---
When you repair a broken hazmat with the improved repair kit you hatta unequip then re aquip or you still take tons of rads standing to close to the SBQ
---
Because they lied to us consistently since release.
---
That's why they don't get credit.
---
If you cure cancer, but kill the entire population of india in order to do it, you don't much credit for the cure either.
---
Bethesda shot itself in the foot by releasing the game too early, breaking countless promises in the progress, and they continue to shoot themselves by still lying.
---
Never seen it. Not sure
---
Will this work for other things? 
---
Is it just as long as the point between  the two is free?
---
Or, in build mode, replace the door wall with a solid wall
---
Plasma Flamer needs it the most...
---
I think you're right it's black in all the other photos definitely just a trick of the light
---
4 shits ain't worth much these days
---
Except that Nerfthesda pussified deathclaws since FO4 when the 1st thing you do in the game is bulky a deathclaw into submission with PA and a minigun.
---
I worked a year to aquire my stuff and it has been way more work, what about that?
---
We could each negotiate trying to get whats best for US, or we could find a compromise thats best for the game and the general community. I favor the latter approach.
---
might have been doing tadpole challenges
---
The problem with the tenderizer Is that Is not a great weapon. I have one in the stash of my 2h melee, but I don't use it. But I don't want to Sell it either.
---
Bet the Queen doesn't like that.
---
The given effect is that to each and every time you deal any damage to an opponent, and each time you are being attacked and an opponent is in like 10 meters range from you, you receive acid damage stacks. These deal a tiny little damage seven times, then disappear. The thing with them is that you can have unlimited amount of stacks, and it literally takes a second to ensure that your opponents get like 150 damage per second for seven seconds.
---
Yeah, you think you got lucky to avoid the rads and them juts drop dead
---
Thats the kind of pvp I would really enjoy in this game! 
---
Also another mod only with crossbow and throwing knifes would be cool.
---
Thats super poor for AAA. lol
---
Many, but how many of those kept playing? I can start screenshoting the number of players every time I log in if you want, I can even make a thread out of it and summon you. I WISH I was exaggerating.
---
Even a couple of days ago there was a thread here about people noticing the reduction in players. It was already bad before BL3, and I can't imagine how it will be once the outer worlds comes out.
---
All those are on my radar except adrenal reaction. I completely missed that one. Thanks!
---
Thank you for sharing this! I stopped growing crops because they took up too much room and ALWAYS looked sloppy. But this. This is excellent. Is there a short video to show how you have a mutfruit growing in a bathtub?
---
Thanks, I'll give it a try.
---
Sooner or later, I‚Äôm just going to make a camp of pure corn or wheat and a single scarecrow in the center.
---
I remember shortly after release some players got banned for life for homophobic hate speech and harassment, so I know action is indeed taken on reports.
---
if that is the only one you think then maybe, but again, they are not thin, just because the armor is sparse doesn't mean what is there isn't bulky, leather is thick and in the case of armor it is layered.  also as I said way back is the pauldrons are the main reason and even light armor has pauldrons.  plus it is literally redundant. you don't wear armor over armor.  what would a few layers of leather under steel do AT ALL?
---
Meh, just call me a purist. I love my lore and Bethesda at some times can fuck it up. I only made the point about the lamps as it was a design and lore feature of the pipboys. If they decide to change it then I will stamp my feet and curse them to hell but in the edn it won't do anything.
---
I also received Knight first and never got Initiate. I didnt kno they dropped in order tho.
---
Don't forget tomohawks
---
So you think it's poison? Guess those poison resistance pieces will come in handy after all! Hopefully I get a chance to try it out, only went against one guy with it. With survival mode gone I might not get a chance though üòü.

I dunno, I'm having fun. There's no sense of urgency, and I appreciate the chance to earn some extra scrip. Plus, all the honey from BEES is a good AP boost, as well as handy to turn in to Sweetwater for dailies. YMMV!
---
I‚Äôve only been to one that failed and I go to several per day
---
If you are talking about Taggerdy, you need to do it completely. No middle checkpoints. If you log off, you need to find the transmitters all over again.
---
One of the first high level players I met online was hanging around Flatwoods with a wanted tag he accidentally got - back in the days where a stray bullet at someone's camp would trigger as damage and make you wanted. I ran scared until he messaged asking me to kill him. I did and we became good friends.
---
Guai means Troubles in my language...That's what they are if underleveled in 76
---
I posted to Bethesda to give DeathClaws a major buff yesterday. As it is, players run toward them... they should be feared like in F4!
---
But the scorched were formed, and are the primary reason why Appalachia is largely devoid of human life, whereas people in other areas had an easier shot at rebuilding because they weren't under constant assault in the same way as the people of Appalachia. Sure they still had creatures and super mutants to deal with, but nothing like the scorched and their hive.
---
It even makes sense in the narrative as a lead into Wastelanders - the scorched forced people out of the area, the vault dwellers then emerged and started fighting back against the scorched, vault dwellers then reclaimed the nuclear arsenal and used it to kill the scorchbeast queen, which broke the scorched hive mind and reduced their threat level enough for people to start moving back into the area.
---
I can  do it on xbox (and have)
---
No, of all the "Bethesda, please" posts, this one points right to the village idiot. "Aside from using a door, how do I stop people from giving me money" would've at least gotten you a few funny replies.
---
F4 they weren't feared either. FO3 and FONV they were true terrors.
---
No, it's rng when you get next.
---
Trust me you'll only gonna see more of them
---
Yeah they announced they remove it.
---
People with medics (that I've noticed) seem to specifically run with teams of friends, so that is the real key behind getting guaranteed use out of a medic. Otherwise you're just a self-gimped soloer. As a chronically-shy person myself, I only recently rolled a wannabe-medic character and my biggest issue right now with her is analysis paralysis on her build... so my tendency to solo is a moot point at the moment (plus I have more fun with my main currently, butanyways). I have my eye on a Brotherhood group though sooo we'll see.
---
Was really hoping that was a real sub.
---
Yup, same here. My brain just goes " you don't want to go there. But click it anyway!"
---
Yeah, I totally avoid the area. Too much too handle, not fun unless you are geared like for a silo run.
---
Honestly, I hope this means in future games they dont get away with a generic gray wasteland like in 3 &amp; 4. Like, I liked the Capital and the Commonwealth, but they were really pretty same-y in terms of environment. 76 has, at the very least, shown us a apocalypse that is simultaneously lush and devastated, full of life and yet somehow barren, unlike anything we‚Äôve seen in the franchise before. This is the kind of world we should be exploring in every Fallout from here on.
---
Then how do you justify underarmor actually giving you any benefits? What good is a spandex under your full set of combat armor?
---
Fallout supporting up to 24 players and able to have players trade, talk, and group up is nothing compared to other quality games like Elder Scrolls Online, heck old game I played Mabinogi had 100s of players in same zone fighting raid bosses while trading and guess what they had an IN GAME CHAT.
---
I can confirm this and place most the blame on this glitch. I was in the same cell as two people at their camp. While I was doing free range I had like 10FPS. Went to check out what I suspected was duping. And yeah the camp was covered in tens of thousands of cleavers.
---
You can't reason with Raiders. Just let the heavy turrets take care of em.
---
I wear an assault gas mask, this would not jive with a mining helmet
---
A headshot will double it again. It‚Äôs not uncommon to pass 10k on a night time headshot crit with a bloody/explosive hunting rifle. It‚Äôll take out a scorchbeast or sheepsquatch with one bullet.
---
Goddamn it my brain just short-circuited and I have lost the ability to pronounce it any other way forever.
---
Thanks :|
---
Legendary drills with no stars and no stats
---
Can‚Äôt anyone turn the switch back on?
---
Because someone at pricketts fort always needs a new burial. That‚Äôs why.
---
There's actually a PvP event called "The Battle that Never Was" that takes place at Prickett's Fort and you can side with the Union or the Confederacy.
---
I've never seen anybody do this event tho. I did it once when the game came out and only was me and another player. I never saw it again.
---
RIP xp bonus and lag free servers.
---
I find way more than just 3 cups with straws there.
---
You know I added the Ash Heap to the "never seen it before" list but it kinda does remind me of FO3
---
Holy crap! So you could literally melt enemies pretty damn easily then huh!? I wish I didn‚Äôt have to worry about losing my stuff so I could do this damn vault raid!
---
That sucks I would of put a prime receiver on my Bloodied Handmade and bought all of your 5.56
---
This made me laugh more than it should have :D
---
Best one by far.
---
Just a heads up, the Tenderizer perk only works at level 1. You are wasting two points at the moment.
---
Why is it so hard for fallout players to just drop shit on the ground?
---
it shouldn't have the DR when in PA, but the SPECIAL boosts would be nice, plus it is literally made to be worn under PA, the BOS underarmor specifically
---
You don‚Äôt go to their website I see? They gave an explanation for the removal of survival... Nuclear Winter has taken shape as an actual competitive pvp mode while survival has devolved into people just wanting lag free servers for raids... barely anyone actually uses survival for it‚Äôs created purpose. It‚Äôll likely undergo major changes IF they ever decide to bring it back
---
I guess it just comes down to opinion then. This is gear earned from the objectively hardest content in the game. The gear as a reward therefore should be objectively the best gear In the game and I'm sure subsequent content in the form of other raids and hard content will give similar gear with similar advantages which will balance the high level players against each other. You SHOULD get a gear advantage as a reward for completing the hardest content over and over again. The content is there for whoever's wants the advantage as well. I'm not saying the acid damage shouldn't be toned down slightly but I AM saying it should be better than a lot of gear in the game and the community will adapt around the advantage like it always has and when vault 96 opens I'm sure its raid gear will counter 94s in terms of balance.
---
Yeah it's those little moments where he's telling (r/b r/b r/b) and my guy is just jumping up and down ,then he asks if I'm retarded and I say "I'm not retarded,I don't know what r/b means"  .I know what it means now.
---
I love Halloween and I love this idea. I'm really hoping for something big with Halloween.

It's back and survival mode is indeed gone.

R.I.P. Survival mode.

What you want to do is plant your crops I‚Äôm the dirt the you can place the bathtub on top of the crops for the illusion of a planter
---
I hope little kids weren't watching me run around town looting like that.I guess I'm going to have to start being more conscientious of my attire.
---
remove after
---
So don't buy it.....
---
They should have random modes like Blackout does on BO4 or Fortnite (I hate putting that name out there lol) but I think it‚Äôd make nuclear winter much more fun &amp; appealing compared to what it is now. Only chance they‚Äôre gonna catch me in NW is if double xp comes back... I want that ronin mask but with the current xp rate it‚Äôd take me a month+ &amp; NW just isn‚Äôt balanced or fun enough for that grind
---
I'd like to see them do a lot more with NW-style PvP besides a battle royale. I like NW a lot more now with the release of the Morgantown map, but let's branch out into some different modes of play.
---
Haha true..
---
Haha yeah I know, I should really just throw it in a display case tbh
---
&gt; barely anyone actually uses survival for it‚Äôs created purpose
---
That's because the last few patches basically ruined survival mode. Applying a flat base damage caps really killed the mode.
---
At 0.1 lbs each that's a solid 40 lbs lol. I've started dropping them
---
I wonder if it differs by platform. On PC (in the northeast US if that matters) there are lots of people at both the prime cuts and BBQ event.
---
Every BBQ I've done (maybe 10 or so any time from 7am to 9pm) has completed at the top level and well before time expires.
---
The family that plays together, slays together. Keep on rockin' the awesomeness.
---
Then we can make it so that armors don't give you DR/ER benefits but give you legendary effects?
---
Cleaver and mine duplication.
---
Did I say I was going to?
---
I never understood the chase for the rare outfits. Out of all of them the red Asylum is the one that has eluded me. 
---
The one time I had an opportunity to get one it would have cost me upwards of 75K worth of goods. Luckily the seller ghosted me because I didn‚Äôt want to overpay. 
---
But as the saying goes, ‚Äúsomething is only worth what people want to pay.‚Äù This holds true in your case.
---
They really still have that hot rod station. That was there in the beginning.
---
I agree I‚Äôm just saying it needed to be removed it just sat there imo. Like I said some people used it but it was really just to raid without lag &amp; such. &amp; the small xp boost
---
I won't login til later today, but I'm curious is there a weekly challenge for a legendary weapon? It used to be survival mode only and I'm wondering if it will be adventure mode now or just gone.
---
Unless you can edit saved blueprints (which I haven't seen the ability to do so? O.o ) I would assume you scrap the rug after plopping the blueprinted goodies into place. Using the rug trick to move things in Fallout 4 was tricky, because deleting the rug would often drop the item part-way into the floor... haven't actually tried the rug trick in 76 for any reason yet myself, I should mess with it just to see.
---
Like I'm glad this person got what they wanted but yeah people have had problems with the game and so far basically all of them have been valid.
---
Yeah last week i got the prompt to do two of the events, at the same time even. Last night tried going back to Camden to see it it was bugged as well but only got the one event.
---
I used to hunt deathclaw with bb guns in nv
---
I'm one of the few PC roleplayers myself. I have fun playing as a non-feral ghoul who decided to stay behind and protect Appalachia.
---
Yeah  a lot of re-skins  /shrug
---
broke 300 myself the other day on main. i switched over to doing queens on alts so that i could stop accumulating them on my main lol.
---
i don't think of them as too many though. it's nice to just repair everything without thinking about it and you can just drop them. free repairs (and a roll of the dice with scrip) is the only for sure reward with value to get from queen and imposter and any other end game content. so at least there is that benefit for end game players. =P
---
Hey, thanks for putting g this up here, OP. I wouldn't have found it otherwise, and playing on PC means I'll never find him in game. This is excellent stuff!
---
I absolutely love meat week, but it seems a big percentage of players are off doing other things these days. The bbq is easy script on the hour and there‚Äôs always a chance for tenderizers and associated mods. That being said ‚Äî I‚Äôve always wondered if performing certain bbq duties increased one‚Äôs chance of getting said weapon and mods, despite it being portrayed as random. Asking as my sole tenderizer and mod were given to me by a buddy. That‚Äôs after I‚Äôve rocked more bbqs to completion then I can count, sometimes nearly solo (hoarding greens and meat to turn in in massive batches, while cleaning poop, putting out fires, cleaning up that gray waste and occasionally taking turns on drums and spits). The one thing I‚Äôve never done is feed chally ‚Äî even though I have the plan. Just curious if doing that in conjunction with the other things secretly increases your chances. My buddy often fed chally, and he ended up with 4 plus all the mods!
---
What‚Äôs with all the haters, it‚Äôs a great game.  This is the first game I‚Äôve played for as long as I have. It has actually saved me a fortune in games. I‚Äôve been gaming for a long time and usually I buy a game maybe weekly or every 2 weeks. If a hate a game I rush just to complete it, to then trade it in. The only other game I play constantly is COD and this year is the first year since it‚Äôs been out I‚Äôve not preordered it or planning on buying it. I‚Äôm sticking with Fallout a bit longer.
---
U forgot the blunderbuss
---
I hunted then with my hands in fo4
---
nah dude. think of it this way, you had your time with it and now you are enjoying another thing.  it paid for itself.
---
No, there isn't. I guess those weapons while be quite rare in a while, even though most are useless.
---
Well you did what you thought was right at the time, and the game is all about trading and acquiring things that you want at that time, then if you want that particular item back it's onto a new objective.Get a new outfit!!
---
I got that info from their website. The comment I read did not state why it was disabled. Blame Valseek for not saying why.
---
You can have a lot more than 4 people in a Division instanced world that's just your group. You can have many groups. That said the Division 1 and 2 both feel very static.
---
It always lets me add friends if I do it in the social tab at the main menu. Once you get on a server though it's usually not working, but I have had it send an invite successfully in game recently, too
---
You could always spell that on your camp walls then to the emote follow me to your camp.  Hopefully they read it and all is good.   Or a PS4/xbox  messege
---
The fact your all defending this as acceptable weekly content shows exactly why this game has been allowed to progress to the state it is in.. ahwell I‚Äôll just delete this not hair of my back all enjoy losing your money üòÅ
---
Ohhh that.
---
Honistly hate it for beds and instruments but I would love it for going outside building due to my dumbass often overlooking it says Apilaticha (Probably botched the spelling on that but whatever)
---
Yeah I mean from the post where they tell you what‚Äôs coming for 76 in the future like a week ago maybe 2 (didn‚Äôt mean to come off rude sorry) but they stated in that post that they would be disabling survival mode October 1st &amp; they gave a reason just can‚Äôt think off the top of my head what exactly they said
---
I do much the same as everyone does it seems - switch to cut the power, garage door linked to same switch to close off the machines....
---
....this thread makes me nostalgic for the the logic gates that existed in FO4...well, one of the expansions anyway. I quite like the idea of being able to build operating logic like this into a base...
---
Your name = excellence.
---
Britt I actually wanted to reply to say that this would be an excellent use for some of the random tokens in the game. Instead of picking them up in the world, use them for this. Could absolutely work if set up similarly to the government supply drops... Everyone can show up, but YOU got to pick this one.
---
&gt;  Fallout 76  \[...\] I think is a precursor for future Bethesda games.
---
Let's fucking hope not.
---
Probably faster will be just use ammo with Lever and Craft some .44 myself - need only some lead.
---
I don't recall saying it wasn't poor. All I said was that you can make a lot of groups of 24 out of 2.46 million.
---
The game may not be bustling everyday, but certainly on weekends it is. I know that because I prefer dead servers so usually have to server hop a couple of times to find one with less than 10 in it.
---
I've noticed when moving crops it's way more pervasive. The exiting build mode and re-entering sometimes works, but it seems like the next one I try to move does the same thing. The best way I've found to do it is to store the crops and then place them.
---
There is also a video I just saw on here today that shows a blueprint workaround that allows you to place them much closer together but I haven't personally tries it yet.
---
It makes you want to stop playing, really frustrating. The game has problems reading damage and hits with melee, fast automatics, shotguns, etc. The only character that I can use reliably is my gunslinger. 300 damage means 300 and it counts.
---
Odd. Well I guess I'll hang on to my Action Hero and Unstoppable Monster then. The rest during my time weren't even interesting enough to bother entering survival for. Was hoping they would come to adventure to collect the rest.
---
On the plus side I was never killed even once in survival since those easiest challenges only took about 20 minutes total with half that taking place in a totally sealed room in my camp. Lol.
---
anything bloodied works well for a bloodied build. nothing really outperforms bloodied stealth commando for utility and damage.
---
for a gat plasma like that, you the ultracite ammo is much cheaper than other weapons (only cheaper thing is gat lasers with power user per flux AFAIK) and you can throw on a suit of zealots for some decent damage on the queen.
---
that gun, plus the heavy perks, nerd rage, zealots set, ultracite ammo, and one gun army is an actual contributor in a queen fight. especially with the boost to ultracite ammo.
---
it's not going to beat out BE heavy weapons if the person is running all the exposive perks, but if you don't wanna blow yourself up, you will be hard pressed to do more damage in the queens face than that one (with the aiming damage boost).
---
Nice idea! I‚Äôll do that at my camp, but we were at another player‚Äôs camp following a primal event :) thanks for the tip!
---
Exactly what I was thinking, besides when people spawn at my camp they get a complete different spawn point over on some railroad tracks,
---
In my wife's CAMP I always end up at the back door on her porch while she is under me in the map.
---
Not very, there's a static spawn in the VTU Test Vault Weight Area
---
Was it that she left the Missiles and nukes laying all around? Never wanting to pick up after herself? 
---
Letting you go hungry and thirsty?
---
Dunno if it still exists but there was an actual event at the fort where you picked a side and either defended or attacked the got
---
who are you talking to.  only 1 person responded.
---
Exactly, I even asked guy to search for radium and gamma, which also are energy guns.
---
U know the worst part about the fridge is its near useless like most of the food
---
I don't think you can compare this game to an MMO. It's closer to Destiny and the Division in scope.
---
Ok thanks!
---
Legit.
---
Looks like a lot of poop.
---
You're not wrong about the trade-only thing - top tier stuff actually available for caps is worth a price bump sometimes.
---
There is a ton of lore.
---
not too rare. there are a few potential spots you can find the plan spawn. the one i know of is on the picnic benches where the teapot house is.
---
I saw a video of an explosive Fleschettes harpoon gun working well as a sniping weapon. Just shoot them, or near them, wait a few seconds, and they're dead.
---
Fallout 4 lets you change the colors, yes, both of the UI and the pip-boy. I keep the UI in Fallout 4 the same lime green it defaults to (out of nostalgia) but I eventually got into using a pale pastel purple for the pip-boy, which makes it less hard on the eyes. It also made the pip-boy light brighter at the same time and looks much more like white light with just a hint of purple.
---
Regardless of color, the pip-boy light is my bane outdoors at night, though. "Crud, I lost a body." Turn light on. Oh right, this game went a bit nuts with the grass/brush. Why do I even bother trying the light? Light goes right back off.
---
There was a paid cheat client that included a teleport to any cell function, thats how they did it
---
They didn't give a reason. It was really vague. Just stated that they were bring it down to focus on wastelanders and will "use our feedback" to improve the core game. 
---
In hindsight it seems like they planned to remove it before wastelanders from the start. The only thing that makes sense is that they nerfed it and removed the maps to get people to stop playing it.
---
At this moment, can only confirm it works this way for crops. And the second crop in a blueprint will always ignore space constraints‚Äîbut only so long as both objects in that blueprint are able to be planted. So, you won‚Äôt be able to plant one corn in the sky while the other is in the ground, or on an object, or under the map, etc. But, even though I‚Äôve tried this with everything on the build menu, I‚Äôve only done so in a limited fashion. There could still be plenty of ways to play around with this.
---
Pets are considered part of your camp, so the only way other players can deal damage to them is if they're in PvP with the camp owner.  Pets can be killed by NPCs though, so those players might have just led an enemy over to the pet and allowed it to get attacked.
---
why do you have to be rude? I thought it was a legit request? I think the green light is dim as well...
---
Any new CAMP items?
---
I'll third this. That's a great (and beautifully simple) idea!
---
Oh wait, the plan. I guess the plan itself is fairly rare, but since suit has a static spawn it probably wont be very valuable unless youre a completionist.
---
Capitalism at its best! If there are no buyers... there are no sellors!
---
Asking the real questions here
---
I wasn't saying in my post, because Beth read these forums, and I don't want them to fix it. But yeah call me a dick if you want, that just gaurentees I won't tell you. Anyone else can PM me but not Takatori, he can suck a bag of brahmin pricks for being a rude cuck.
---
I've been camped out under the billboard between Arktos and Morgantown for about a month now, and I get pretty decent sales on my ammo and outfits. I have to do an outfit run about once a week.   Magazines and bobbleheads go almost within an hour of me putting them there (thank you B for adding display shelves, people are eating those up at good prices now)
---
if you are running solo melee there is no point. you should really be in stealth and everything is pretty much a one shot kill so just use lone wanderer. any other cha perks are not great solo IMO. 
---
personally, cha is a dead stat for me. i got tired of swapping out lone wanderer for party perks when i could just move the points over to literally any other stat and have them contribute all the time.
---
if solo, i'd skip cha. just keep one for travel agent.
---
tenderizer does help, but i think as others  have mentioned the higher ranks are broken and the only fight i ever even think about equipping it for is queen. imposter doesn't have enough hp to really waste time with it.
---
If you are at their camp and are on a team you can even spell on their wall if their budget is not at 100%
---
At some point there‚Äôs few things left for some people - I‚Äôd trade collection stuff for useful items too but my shopping list is getting smaller by the day.
---
Weird? Usually the server doesn‚Äôt respond and kicks me to the login screen. I then login and I‚Äôm allowed to play on a different server again.
---
Excellent. Thank you!
---
Anytime you pick up a weapon just repair. Also they can be over 100% durability and you can still repair them. I use mine all the time to keep my numbers down. I'm still sitting at 140 some though.
---
I play mostly on weekends and weekly nights, which should be peak hours. Server hopping changes nothing.
---
What part of the world are you? West EU here. I can prove it to you given that you care for that sort of statistics in a couple weeks time.
---
Just keep using them for repairs so you can lower their quantity.
---
I've been around multiple people wearing the armor at the SBQ event (at least two people at the same event) and only seen slight FPS hiccups.
---
I've had a good mix of pvp encounters and can say that all of them cause me to freeze in unpredictable ways. Explosive weapons (legacy and non-legacy) do seem to amplify the effect.
---
I've survived legacy explosive gatling lasers by freezing mid air for 10 seconds and unfreezing in time to hide and heal. However in a different encounter with the same person using the same weapon I have frozen and had to kill the game. 
---
One shot from an explosive harpoon gun has caused me to freeze completely to the point where I have to kill the game. Other times I just get the 5-15 second freeze. Yesterday I encountered one where the opponent jumped up from behind a wall to fire a single harpoon shot (flechette of course) I froze in time to see the explosive effect  in mid air halfway between us, waited over a minute and killed the game. 
---
A non explosive minigun combined with the armor has caused me to do the 5-15 second freeze where I eventually resume and find myself laying dead on the ground. Further engagements with the same person caused freezes that required killing the game. 
---
I can think of two other encounters where unknown non-explosive weapons were used and caused me to freeze. I was too far away to identify the weapon beyond knowing it was a silenced pew pew.
---
It's way scarier than FO3, with flames bursting out of the ground, underground rumbling, toxic air and so on.
---
Ahhhh, hello there Mr. Grushnak
---
Vended that junky hammer as soon as I got it, it's not good and weighs 20lbs. Non-legendary weapons will always be inferior
---
Thats every endgame in most AAA launches year one. I have yet to play a AAA game where the endgame has had enough content to support the hardcore players that reach the end within the first week or 2 of release. As for the creator of this post he has an excellent point all of the negativity surrounding the game is overdone. There are problems with the game but most are relatively minor, and have been seen in past bethesda titles. I am dumbfounded that anyone would think this game would be bug free given their track record, thats a known quantity going in. All the negativity and bad press will do for us will ensure they do not take a gamble like this again in making an innovative coop rpg experience. Also most of the criticism (not all) I see of this game is not constructive it is bitching for the sake of bitching.
---
So it's whoever lasts the longest? Sounds fancy. If only I was on PC.
---
Oh wow a raider power armor, how rare and precious! That guy definitely was driven by kindness and not because he wanted get rid of some weight in his inventory! 
---
Seriously, people should stop making posts like this. It happens everyday, everytime and with much more valuable stuff.
---
I think there's some significant server lag sometimes too.  I've noticed that the game can take \~ 20 seconds to realize that we had just killed the last mob of the wave.
---
Oohhhh! I'm definitely getting the rifle skin and skull helmet!
---
Where is the tower located? It sounds hilarious and I want to check it out.
---
they just need to be careful if they go to the next step, I heard they spread crabs!
---
I have a heavy weapons build.  I use a vampire ultracite gatlin lazer and t51b armor.  I don't die ever it steals health insanely fast.  I was able to tank the Meat Week mirelurk queen with no problem.  It holds up to 999 rounds and can fire for a long long time.  I'm currently working on upgrading it with mods by killing the scorch beast at the fisures.    
---
There is a down side, the only time I've died using it was against the mirelurk king legendary mobs. So you can't tank everything. Well, not so much in pvp... you need to first be able to hit the target to start stealing hp.  So, it wont work well against the sniper builds that one shot you.  
---
 The other thing that is a pain is getting enough fusion cores.  The PA and gun both use them so they demand a lot of em.  To keep a good amount of cores you really need to own the Posiden Energy plant.  And this is trouble because it enables pvp.  Also, you can only get 3 cores per 27 minutes or so... There is a perk in Int that will double the duration of the fusion core after you invest in 3 points.  It's worth it imo.    
---
Also, the fusion core is energy ammo and the weight can be reduced quite a bit with the perk under Int although I don't use it.  I do run around with 30+ pounds of fusion cores...  
---
Its a work in progress but this is my perks sofar at lvl 75 [https://imgur.com/a/UBvfeX5](https://imgur.com/a/UBvfeX5)  
---
Good luck with your new dude :)
---
You are reading waaaaay too much into my comment.
---
u/AdventureDriver is correct. Those crops are clipping through objects I‚Äôve placed over top of them.
---
Yeah, I joined Scorched Earth event, now that it's free fast travel, and it puts you in the nuke zone lol
---
But it looks grey and blocky like FO3. But okay, we'll give it the ambience. Anyway to add onto what I said then, all the regions are so unique and good. Reminds me of ESO where each zone feels like a different world. Except this is all continuous
---
you just want legendary PA, we all do, but just make legendary PA rather than letting us wear bulky armor that wouldn't fit under an Iron Man suit
---
UK. And no, I don't really care.
---
Best guess? They were broken in an attack and someone felt REALLY bad for messing up your camp, so they left you a gift. If it was a death thing, I imagine they would have come back. You did say it was good junk!
---
You can't please everybody.  Everyone has their own opinion and right to feel the way they do about anything - not just this game.  Unfortunately we live in a society that has a permanent 'herd mentality mutation' - as evident by the Youtube videos that became popular mostly because they garnered views from disgruntled players (even though most likely, the maker of the vid only put a few hours into the game - if that.)  The sheepish behavior I see everywhere in this game, look at all the camps resembling floating fortresses, etc.  
---
I've been a gamer all my life, this isn't the first glitchfested game I've taken a liking to.  Perhaps a lot of people who truly dislike the game are the day 1 players - and more than likely have a right to feel the way they do - however I do believe a good majority of them only hopped on the bandwagon of hate.. well because they took the serum.
---
I tried to set my camp up there, but every server I spawn into has a guy sitting there with his camp and 6 to 8 turrets.
---
I bought those ugly-ass tire walls and put them in two-high to protect my cornfield. I plant a half dozen of something else easily replaceable outside the walls to give the mobs something to focus on in sight of a turret. Works well for most things except molerats.
---
Same here.. but if I want it.. I still "sell" it.. but at a higher price.. Everything has a price. Hey... If your going to give me 1000 caps for a Violet flux... PLEASE take them all.... I never actually thought it would sell... but it did..
---
Things I'm "really" selling... it's cheap... all else.. is high enough to keep it but hey if you want it... take it!!! Please
---
Guess I‚Äôll wait till next week and hope for something to spend atoms on that‚Äôs not raiders
---
You're right :(
---
Oh, it'll be you. I use a shotgun. There is nothing stealthy about a big angry shotgun.
---
Ah my bad I thought I read at least some sort of explanation I must‚Äôve mad it up I just woke up lol. It wasn‚Äôt exactly a top mode i think most of us use adventure and I believe more people even play NW over it. Dropping like half of your aid is a no-go for me. I played it once for unstoppable monster &amp; died once... took me down to 20 stimpak‚Äôs took me forever to recover lol
---
I was going to suggest that just put it in a room then make the door a wall and turn power off.
---
Young guy üòâ
---
They did say why. The stated reason is that decision was made to abandon Survival to focus on other projects (presumably Wastelanders). There might be other reasons (likely lack of interest from the player base leading to a lack of support from Bethesda and the addition of a tertiary mode specifically focused on taking on other players and trying not to die in a consequence free environment) but that's the reason they gave, and it's probably true enough.
---
What can you expect? Outside of the fan base, the perception of this game is ruined. Unless Bethesda pulls a no man sky, the general public will continue to think of 76 as a continual failure.
---
YOW WHY I heard the top of the world bitch say it during a quest.  She might have been high a f tho
---
Don't get me wrong I enjoy the game but bethesda fully deserves 90-95% of the hate they got for this game
---
I carry a sniper rifle on two alts who aren't spec'd for it *at all*; one is an unarmed tanky-ish chick (no power armor) and she uses the rifle quite a bit... the other char is a sneaky melee. My new medic is in a flux of weapon tests so I don't remember what she has at the moment (other than some underwhelming automatic weapons which was probably a horrible choice anyways). The alt who doesn't have a sniper rifle is a vats-crits pistol build guy and man, I keep wanting to just hand him one anyways... hoping it'll be a little better with more levels, as a similar build is hilarious fun in Fallout 4.
---
Butanyways, rifles can be decent without the perk cards, especially if you're looking to do some damage from a distance before wading into the slogfest, or if you just wanna cheeseball-vats a quick shot or two. The build you posted isn't my style at all so I'm not sure what to comment, besides that if you want to hack level 2-3 terminals you'll need 3 int. Same on the perception end of things, if you decide to chuck out a lot of sniper perks, keep 3 perception for lockpick ranks 1, 2, and 3.
---
I think we should go cotton so we can call it all natural! I mean, nightmares fall under that all natural thing, right? üòÑ
---
I always have trouble pricing my stuff
---
Sold a explosive bloodied Gatling gun for 5k only to realize I could have likely gotten more
---
And it's for the best.
---
Can anybody confirm if Bethesda fucked up the hunting rifle skin? Does it apply to the other butt stock as well, or just the taped-up one shown?
---
Of all the things I thought I‚Äôd be server hopping for bobble heads was not one of them
---
I got a ton of candy from an event and I planned on giving it out this month.
---
Only take one though :)
---
That makes YOU right, friend! Lighting was your idea. üòâ
---
no it is only controlled by the camp owner
---
have to agree, if they just added Primal Meat as an uncommon/rare drop from the Primal Creatures, based on difficulty, level or "Size" it would mitigate much of this.
---
Can I buy more camp budget with Atomic shop and stash since I have to tear down shit to use anything new?
---
Seriously I‚Äôm at a stand still.
---
Use a scorpion syringer...lol
---

---
I don't think it's possible to overstate what a uniquely appealing world they've managed to create. I'm sure I never would've touched an online game if not for FO76. Hell, I picked up gaming as an adult specifically for their previous titles and likely wouldn't be playing anything at all it not for Fallout. Maybe I'm an outlier, but I suspect a significant part of their fanbase are people who couldn't care less about the drama or grievances of the gaming community, we're just here to play the game...
---
using the standard(currently known) mine/thrown weapon duplication glitch?
---
Mutfruit first, THEN bathtub. Gotcha. Thanks! Top crop tips all over the place!
---
You want me to tag bethesda in my response too so they can patch it ? Cuck.
---
See this is the biggest gripe I had with PvP, it was boring as everyone used the same like 3 weapons. Still RIP.
---
Wow, that's a hell of a weapon..
---
Dope I'm down
---
Even if there weren't any bugs. Is the extra 1% and extra duration really worth it for a solo build?
---
&gt;lacking cosmetic rewards, restricted building, and underdeveloped story.
---
I'm not sure what you played, but I don't think you played FO76...or you just blasted through it. The story line is actually very good and does more to advance the lore than the more recent fallout games. The difference is that the story requires that you actually explore, go through the terminals,  read the notes, listen to the holotapes...
---
As for aesthetic items, there are more weapons,  weapon mods, armors and mods, power armor types and mods, under armors and outer wear(costumes) than any other fallout. It's not even close. That's just what's available playing the game, if you throw content from the atom shop the amount of variety is crazy. 
---
The building also has a much bigger range of available options and items than 4...again throw in atomic shop and it's staggering. 
---
Does it have flaws? Yup,lots of them, just like most titles out there...the one huge difference is Bethesda is turning out fixes and patches faster than they've ever done...and yup, they've had more of their share of missteps there too, but they continue to keep plugging away at problems and, in general,  it trends better over time. Large incoming DLC as well,  for free. Wastelanders is going to radically expand/alter the game. Finally,  from a value standpoint,  I've got &gt; 1200 hours into FO76, more than double any other game I've played, for a $60 buy in. By far the biggest bang for my entertainment dollar than anything else I can think of. 
---
In closing,  does FO76 deserve some shit? Sure, but it also does deserve praise for an absolutely massive world filled with content.
---
Because what Fallout 76 is doing is not impressive or innovative. It‚Äôs actually more dysfunctional than a lot of indie games currently on Steam that have the same gameplay design
---
Are you honestly surprised? That's why they released the unarmoured one first, so now you need to buy the other one as well. Noticed we have another 700 atom fridge in the store this week too. Cretins
---
Pacifist turned on should be from logging into that world and you can‚Äôt change it on the fly. It should also mean no harm whatsoever since many don‚Äôt want PvP. 
---
Those that do can be a different color on MAp...
---
Nothing new,just sales of old stuff, like the Free States Gennie
---
Don‚Äôt give me that shit.. I recorded &amp; edited this video/ took all these photos all from my ps4.. if you really wanted to do it.. you would.
---
These are excellent tips, thank you! I wish you and your crops a healthy and bountiful harvest.
---
Here's a great resource: [https://map76.com/term/terminal](https://map76.com/term/terminal)

---
I like that they'll still vend if the power is out, it helps if you're away from your camp but your generator is busted by mobs.
---
I feel ya, I've taken to rebuilding my camp from time to time and I find I leave stuff out which opens up more space , not sure what I left out but it can't be that cool looking if I couldn't remember
---
I allways and will allways call it Yogi Bear. Same as I call the Sheepsquatch for that sheep thingy.
---
hello there mr... and you are?
---
regardless feel free to join the event.
---
I just wanna wear my military cap with.
---
Ha yeah I learned pretty quickly to only carry 9 at a time. Otherwise you drop like the whole stack. Idk up until the nerfs the playerbase was growing. Saw new players and groups crop up all the time. It was fun to watch the clan turf wars. And while I'd never say it to their faces I enjoyed watching some players progress and git gud.
---
Survival mode just made me love adventure mode more. But without it the game just feels flat.
---
I think this is the friendliest interaction I've had on the internet.. I'm not sure how to react üòÇ and it's a shame I wouldn't mind a nice brown leather jacket
---
I just turnt sneak bloodied commando,is the queen doable with this build or u die alot from all the mobs?
---
You have no idea how any of this works do you? All you need for broken armor is to go afk for a couple of minutes while rad roaches attack. There is no "prep time", you break the armor once and it's done.
---
Bloodied you have to manage radiation levels which is constantly changing.
---
I have a bloodied FFR pipe auto and it's fantastic. I use it all the time for killing mobs and farming runs since .38 ammo is everywhere. Totally agree with you mate. Think you got a great deal if you enjoy it that much.
---
Why do people keep throwing out dumb analogies where one isn't needed? The complaint is pretty self explanatory. And it also has the same solution... If you don't like the way the franchise is moving than go across the street to the other franchise. Sitting at your table constantly whining about things the other patrons can't change, and holding hosts responsible for decisions they didn't even make isn't healthy for you.
---
Because they‚Äôre pieces of shit.
---
I walked away from the game a while ago, but keep checking in both the store and the forum to see if Beth has gotten their act together, a la ESO after their first year.
---
Very little hope left. Wastlanders won‚Äôt be enough, even assuming it goes of without a disaster. They also need to stop being pieces of shit with the way they are fleecing players in the store.
---
Known to me as of last night, not sure how long it‚Äôs been around for.
---
 Sure there are people affected by moldy helmets and vinyl bags, I get that but once again I'm talking about the WORLD, the playable multiplayer game space.
---
and all my collections are at 0 so have to start again :(
---
Mother fuckin dark wood laminate!
---
Yea, i wanted to wear my metal helmet with it. Was going for a chrome plated look, but i guess that will never happen. Greedy bastards...
---
Wait I took a hiatus from the game back when it had a lot of bugs, and just now seeing this has me worried. Has PVP been scrapped?
---
Yes, because running around in circles like a headless chicken seems so much fun? o_O
---
Also... does it actaully have DR or ER? Thats what i want to know. If it is, thats really pushing PTW.
---
I know I‚Äôve gotten knight and Captain twice, because I‚Äôve sold those plans out of my machines since they were (Known).
---
gotcha, made "very public" recently, hopefully it will get patched soon
---
I see your side of it. My experience with any sort of PvP was stealth boy, jumpy boy, Tesla rifle... gave me a brain hemorrhage lmao. Maybe they‚Äôll make actual worthwhile changes to it &amp; bring it back but it‚Äôll likely be an end of next year type of thing.
---
To be honest, I've had rank 1 on forever. I am a melee build, so I generally one hit enemies, but I'll try to remember to run some tests.
---
No, what I want is consistency. If this underarmor thing is gonna happen because immersion, then the game should also make normal armors thin enough wearable under PAs. There's no reason not to. You keep saying there's no reason to wear armor over armor but +3 to all attributes per piece is a good enough reason imo
---
Yes!
---
Or perhaps no benches and/or stash boxes in a reachable area?
---
Which ones? Rust? Ark? Not even close. I own and play/played those games. Any others?
---
You mean the sometimes completely unplayable multiplayer game space?..
---
(The games world has as many issues as the game that also causes for its own backlash) yeah they have created a big virbrant beautiful world.. once that is almost hell to play in sometimes due to server stability, bugs and other kinds of issues.. just cause you have not encountered them doesn‚Äôt mean other players haven‚Äôt..
---
was there a patch? I thought it wad just server maintenance.
---
"Yo guy"
---
Like, "Yo guy that fucking bear ate my leg"
---
Best value out of them for sureüëçüèª
---
I set up 1 vendor box with items I want to keep, but don't want mixed with regular inventory, and priced at 25k so they won't sell.
---
The difference is developer team size....
---
No patch notes because there was no patch
---
They patched at least one thing. Can't share PA skins anymore. Lol.
---
if everyone was like 1 specials and no perks (it was the civil war right? perks hadn't been invented yet haha) 
---
so if you get shot, its an instant down (and being revived by squaddies w/ unlimited stimpaks for allies only).  then the bayonet charges and/or revolutionary sword duels, huzzah!  Huzzah, I say!
---
Oookay.
---
no they introduced a survival mode without pvp restrictions then they did a lot of changes to balancing, and now they removed the mode
---
No? They patched at least one bug. Sharing PA paint.
---
All my scrip has dissapeared
---
It hasn't done anything in months.
---
I agree. I've been playing BL3 and for some reason CEO of Gearbox Randy Pitchford being a dick in real life has no affect on my enjoyment of the game.
---
Fallout 76 looks and feels like a poorly mad MMO that makes people sick
---
I hate how small items normally the cool ones that take more server to render are more expensive like the neon letters......I mean I get it but I don‚Äôt.
---
We shouldn‚Äôt be punished by server resource and code short comings.
---
I had to scrap a ton of stuff to just use 8 neon letters.
---
Thanks!
---
Not gonna happen unless they can put it in the atom shop, let's be real here.
---
I don't think it's a bad idea, I just don't like all the conditions set to actually PVP. Kind of sucks all the suspense out of being attacked.
---
But I'm also just bummed about survival mode. I'll check back once I'm done with my salt pile over here.
---
I don't mean exactly like it is now but future games being in a virtual world where you play with groups of people and give the producer the opportunity to continue to sell content vs a one-off game purchase. ESO and FO76 are only the beginning... digitally delivered subscription based games are the future.
---
Not saying it's good or bad... yet.
---
- removed survival mode
---
- atom shop update
---
- unknown bugs reintroduced due to zero configuration management.
---
- maybe some bugs fixed, we hope so anyway
---
(Hey, I love‚Äôem but that‚Äôs about how it goes)
---
&gt;And of course the entitlement card. Its not like there were promises made, lets ignore those.
---
Therein lies the problem..
---
A comment made on Twitter does equate to  a promise.IRL, things change, plans change, situations change and if you, or say a company,  can't adapt they'll struggle and ultimately fail.
---
Pretty sure anyone can attack pets...
---
Hard to test with the dmg numbers since the effect is delayed
---
I love the map. I love how they made this version of West Virginia *almost heaven*. Unfortunately, that does not hide it's other and tbh heavier problems, most of which are not yet addressed despite being almost a year since release.
---
Fixed the bug where you could share PA paint. You know that was their #1 priority.
---
Hyped for the free Mr. Handy.
---
You mean they should get credit for an empty map using fallout 4 assets?
---
Shit every modder deserves more praise.
---
Seriously? What does this game innovate in? Its an asset flip kept by shoe strings.
---
A reminder that something as simple to code as a text chat is 1 year away.
---
I have yet to see any criticism of this game that is just straight lies or just bitching.
---
I spam ‚Äúbuild‚Äù until it places the damn thing.
---
This technique also works with turrets!
---
Nah it's just cosmetic so no stats
---
That's a good idea. I wish they had a test dummy you could put in the camp.
---
I think the bomber jacket might be brown, though I would have to Google to confirm. There ARE nice people on the internet. You just have to find them. Personally, I recommend Filthy Casuals. üòÅüëç
---
It was an easy fix no doubt
---
you say that like reporting bugs is a bad thing?
---
thats super interesting.  do u mean like asymmetrical fights: brotherhood loadouts (amor/lasers) vs "scorched" loadouts (chem/melee) or more even like brotherhood vs enclave or settler v raider battles?
---
I'd rather see a limitation that you cannot claim a workshop if you have pacifist mode enabled.
---
Nope.  I have a pet Deathclaw and people constantly try shooting it for a while until they realize it's dealing no damage, and then they see the giant tag next to its name and realize it's a pet.  Not sure why you're downvoting me when I'm posting accurate information.  You can easily confirm this by getting a pet of your own and having a friend try to shoot at it (while not in PvP with you).
---
Serums for me. I buy low (200 caps or less) and sell at a moderate price in my vendor (350 to 375). I sell to robot vendors. I use a Grape Mentats and Hard Bargain and drink a beer and I can get 425 per serum from vendors. My Charisma is low, so people can probably do better. 
---
I sell 3 a day to the robots, the rest go pretty quick in my vendor. Went from 5k to 25k in less than 3 days using this method, playing about 3 hours a day. Which is why I sell for 375 to players. They make 50+ caps per serum, I just made 175+ and everyone wins. 
---
And do Encryptid when it comes up. Get plans for The Fixer. I make a level 50 Fixer and throw it up for 400 caps, sells every time.
---
I know there‚Äôs a tower in the North of the Savage Divide near the Red Rocket Mega Stop That has a lot of Halloween decor and you can find the witch hat there + a skeleton costume (normally). It‚Äôs around the pumpkin house.
---
I didn't know it was bugged. Typically I play solo so I don't do SBQ. However, doesn't suppressor also work in a similar way. Making the monster do less damage towards everyone?
---
Of course not. It's a hat.
---
Definitely not the case. Had two armor, weapon, *and* power armor stations all at ground level, and a chem bench and brewing station. Plus stash boxes *everywhere*.
---
&gt;Ok. Many people disagree, and thats why I barely see 8 people in a server at any given time.
---
Ummmm, are you sure you're playing FO76? I'm on PC, and severs are pretty damn full every time I log on.
---
Okay, thats a relief. Lol.
---
Rip
---
Meh. Weird that they can fix a PA bug that involves the atom shop in only days but leave a PA bug that freezes your character for almost a year.
---
which you could get if they made legendary PA, jesus kid, I get it, you want Bloodied PA, but immersion, for me, means underarmor goes under PA, not more armor, that's redundant and stupid as fuck
---
I had not considered getting one star and three cards, thank you.
---
it doesn't work at rank 1 either....
---
No there isn't "a bug"
---
...there are a few. I've also seen the 2 shots forward one shot back bug with semi auto rifles.
---
Nice Try Todd! Nice try ! LMFAO. 
---
Yeah some bugs need to be fixed, something they overlooked since beta and for me is just another part of the game (maybe it is like a little easter egg they wanted us to find themselves) or maybe it isn't, although its hardly ground breaking game breaking glitch, just means you can have some extra damage resistance and a little bump to your special stats from the under armour. Not sure if other types work too, will have a little play with it later. I know BOS deffo doesn't already we tested that.
---
I've had disconnects and crashes and yet my mortgage has still been paid and my kids have not gone hungry. Maybe I'm just not as sensitive to issues in an ambitious MP game. With the amount of moving parts this game has I'm just happy it's not worse.
---
Try using Empath constantly. It‚Äôll take your difficulty up to Hard.
---
I don't run stealth but I see your point. I need the lone wanderer for the defense mostly. I aim to run Junkie so I don't take advantage of Nerd Rage or Serendipity. What would you personally move the points to if I took them out of charisma?
---
They have even said its a complex problem. Just because people bitch about it doesnt mean they can fix it faster
---
I didn't know that. Can you confirm this?
---
Wow how amazing. Red Tires. An exact copy of my other tires but now Red. Take my money Tom Howard.
---
As a huge fan of the Fallout franchise, I love FO76 more than any other game before it. As good as FO3, FONV, and FO4 were, none of them could keep my attention like 76 has.
---
Plus, the Wastelanders is on the horizon, and I am now considering on not playing any of the new software that is due out in the coming months.
---
Sure 76 has bugs, lag, and connection issues, but man... the map and the content therein keeps me coming back!!
---
What do you mean that its delayed?
---
[GaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_as_a_service) is an already existing business model, one that favors providers rather than consumers. Like, largely. I'd prefer to have distinct full-priced (well developed) titles across a reasonable amount of time.
---
So you count acquiring all that unyielding as set up time and spending 30 secs standing near radiation. 
---
But do not count getting your choice of legendaries,  getting all 5 pieces (some that rad roaches really reach to well) broken as set up time. 
---
Discounting the fact that those pieces devalue your Berserker weapon while they break. Or the fact that should they for a random reason become unequipped you have to do it again. 
---
But yet I‚ÄôM the one that has no clue?
---
why are you like this?  if you are a kid my apologies, but stay in school
---
It's all good! I started my video gaming days with Skyrim and can't tell you how man containers marked 'empty' that I opened...
---
Its because of the world, lore and possibilities that I play the game whenever I have the chance. Just the letter and terminal entries are evidence of love and hard work. It is a very special game. It has always been. Love the Fallout universe.
---
I‚Äôm playing with a friend that this happened to just now as well
---
Yes that's weird for 100+ hours with the same internet connection, also with 0 kick from the server (never kicked before)
---
For what it's worth, the amazon one is technically a digital copy. I got one for my mule account, the game box comes with a paper disc in it with the game code and instructions to go download it from Bethesda's site.
---
Well maybe I don‚Äôt fully understand how the perk works, but isn‚Äôt it the subsequent shots after a first shot that should experience dmg increase?
---
Okay, just checking to make sure. It being labeled as armored was starting to make me worry. Haha
---
they should at least release a statement as to why they conducted a maintenance
---
&gt; But I'm also just bummed about survival mode. I'll check back once I'm done with my salt pile over here.
---
^^ This. It is hard to objectively give a response to any suggestions at the moment.
---
You missed the point the OP was making entirely. 
---
He's not saying it's not buggy. He's not saying it doesn't have issues. 
---
He's saying, that everything else aside. The actual game world , WV as a setting, is done pretty excellently. 
---
With which I'd agree. Its the most diverse, interesting and prettiest of the Fallout landscapes.
---
I wondered that myself, but I swear it sounds like Rose pronounces it "yogi" in one of the quests.  From that point on, I just thought it was word play on Yogi Bear and went with it because they're mutated bears.
---
Yup, tested it myself with multiple weapons on both human and npc targets. All shots do the same damage.
---
if its the one im thinking of, you had to fight off waves of confederate or union bots.  idk if it extended to humans also
---
From your examples of games most people here can see you haven‚Äôt even tapped into online survival open world multiplayer games.. there are many out there with beautiful virbrant interactive open world that host up to 50+ players and actually work.. your example Divison and destiny show you have stuck to AAA route and what is the most popular try venturing out there and you will find fully functioning games that work how fallout 76 is supposed to..
---
I just have not picked the mutations, I wanted the core build first. I was committed to 12 strength by the time I decided rifle. :-(
---
I think the outfits are cool but I only collect them to use as trade for items like armor and weapons.  I would have done that trade too. I like to have stuff that actually has a use in the game.
---
So I should just burst it. Got it. Does the flamer do decent damage on it's own? 
---
That seems similar to what I set up as well. I have the perk that reduces teammates rads when I have rads. Again this is meant for just my wife so i know most bloodied builds wouldn't appreciate that. But what do you think?
---
Yeah sure modders deserve more praise I mean it took modders years to come up with a barely playable MP Skyrim. It's not the assets it's about all of the moving parts of a highly interactive RPG brought into the MP space.
---
And you could rock up to someone in your clean suit and rock their world! I kept out of so many fights in my clean suit... and looked good doing it!
---
Thank you, I will investigate that.
---
Yes but what I am saying is if the game world downright DOESNT WORK a high majority of the time.. then there is no acceptable reason to praise Bethesda for the world.. I have no missed OPs point atall you are missing mine..
---
How about just more flash light colors for both pipboy and power armor?
---
You did very well, trust me :)
---
I don't have this issue. I played a bunch yesterday and there were always people at the events. 
---
Especially cookout. It's why my camp got moved right beside the event. I had no shortage of after event customers.
---
I'm blowing up bases right now it's so funny
---
A few people have mentioned that it doesn't work currently. I'm going to assume that you are all correct and swap it out for the extra tankiness. I've been dying pretty fast recently so it might help.
---
Only time I could one shot sheepsquatches is with my unarmed bloodied build with nukashine.  Never have done it with bloodied rifleman.
---
You get more credit for multiple turn-ins than turning in stacks, but that is problematic when trying to do it solo. 
---
Green thumb helps too, a bit.
---
That is STYLE! Tell the truth, you did it on purpose. üòÑ
---
Why you keep saying underarmor should go under PA? It ain't accurate at all lore wise. You had to wear recon armor under T45s but it is not needed on other armors. And if you are gonna wear anything under your PA, it should be spandex 100%. Something like recon armor or wetsuit. You don't want your cloth getting stuck between PA and anything cotton or leather is going to be super uncomfortable especially if you are sweating and will damage you are gonna get blisters and peeled skil all over your body.
---
yeah, I would def do a respec
---
Ok hipster. I own and play/played Arma 2 Dayz and Wasteland mods. Same for Arma 3. Ark, Rust, Miscreated etc.
---
"try venturing out there and you will find fully functioning games that work how fallout 76 is supposed to.."
---
Which ones?
---
Because people like to shit on Bethesda...and this is the internet.  Sometimes I think the internet was created for people to bitch about things. Bethesda gets treated like this whenever they release a game..and it goes all the way back to the early games ( Morrowind, Oblivion, etc... ).  
---
With that said...Bethesda absolutely does deserve some criticism about how FO76 was released.  Frankly, it wasn't in a polished state at all on release...but much of the bitching I see is 'normal' internet complaining and such...
---
Can you elaborate? Specific to atomic shop paints or did they also block in game learned paints (BOS, nuka, etc)?
---
You got *all* of the rewards? The Tenderizer, all tenderizer mod plans, both hats, the chef outfit, tato salad recipe, meat cleaver plan, and meat week flag plan?
---
Can I get some of your RNG? Mine is obviously lacking. 
---
I realize you mean you got them all during the first meat week but still, that's awesome.
---
Want to argue, but as someone who missed the first meat week and only got to experience this one, it quickly became "dull" even though I still need a couple items to complete my "collection".  
---
# I think it would be less so if they would stop trying to "nerf" the fun factor.....  
---
**-Prime Creatures don't have any chance of dropping prime meat, so when the "Primal Cuts" event fails due to lag, spawn problems, or something else you're more or less screwed.**    
---
Personally I would happily farm the events if there wasn't a high rate of failure in some locations due to unresolved issues.  
---
**-Prime Creatures won't spawn as a legendary, with the exception of the "Boss" which is locked to 1\***  
---
Would be common place to see ALL of the "Primal Cuts" events being done if this wasn't the case.    
---
**-Tenderizer can't be learned and you can't get a Legendary Variant....**  
---
They made a plan to learn the ability to craft it, but of course failed / declined to add it to the loot tables and there is no way to obtain a legendary version which turns a nice new weapon into a "Gimmick" most won't keep due to it's unreasonable weight, doubly so when it's upgraded.  
---
All they would have to do is make 1\*-3\* versions of the Tenderizer a rare (not a 1/100,000 Bethesda FFS) reward, lets say a 1/10 chance ([Drop chance Calculator](https://xplainthegame.com/dropchance-calculator/) read before responding) for it to happen, with the typical 1\* - 3\* Chances.  
---
Or Make it like the V94 plans, were you need Legendary Modules to craft, it would not be unreasonable to require some solid material requirements (not crazy, just harder to get items) and a Legendary module per star you want on the weapon...
---
Sounds like the health regen bug. Usually switching servers or relogging fixes it.
---
okay, now I am definitely being trolled, the Brotherhood wears underarmor while in PA, it is orange and white and literally in the game.  and if clothing could get stuck how the fuck wouldn't armor jam shit up?  go away troll
---
Many people agree with you.
---
\&gt; And to compensate players capable of killing someone with one or two  shots I suggest that 
---
\&gt;the first 5 hits do a minimum of 10 damage 
---
Did you mean maximum damage 10 (per hit)?
---
Asking because last time I (lvl 141, pacifist on, in power armor, at full health) was killed by another player (L153), he used a 2 shot explosive weapon.  2 hits, I was dead.
---
"run"
---
Just keep checking, another patch or two should bring it back.
---
Because it‚Äôs not groundbreaking technology. Was your last console a gameboy advance?
---
The first time I saw cranberry bog/ that little Forest area it has near the fissure site, breathtaking
---
Yeah I used to have it but must have dropped it I was after a replacement for it
---
Oh I solo too man, honestly compared to Imposter which is pretty hard, SBQ is a cakewalk. Suppressors works similar yeah but I don't find it that useful, maybe if you grouped often perhaps.
---
not going to be rude.
---
But it's that mindset the "I've had minimal issues I'm fine with it." Little do you realize that you're actually playing around bugs, glitches and poor AI constantly. Because you've accepted it, which is fine on a basic level. But on a large scale .. minor problems you experience could be major to others and they could be facing MORE issues that you do ... for a number of reasons.
---
They're console/computer is not up to snuff.
---
Internet issues.
---
Not even being able to get past a load screen.
---
Etc. 
---
I can assure you that that there are still 100's of minor and major bugs within the game. Some get ironed out and some never will. But giving BGS praise for this is not something I can find in me to do, sure if "can" be pretty to look at. But there are dozens of better looking games. A pretty game world, full of bugs ... but still pretty .. is not praise worthy. Now, when they fix a large amount of the glaring bugs that carried over from FO4 .. then maybe.
---
Standard Gameboy. Thanks for your contribution.
---
Yes thanks u/TripleThicc, I can't remember where it was exactly but I do think its in the N/E quadrant of the map. Found it while visiting all the towers for a badge.
---
The helmet issue, from what I've heard, was for the GameStop helmets that apparently only affected 32 of them, since only 32 were bought. Or something like that, so that shouldn't even affect this game
---
Took Bethesda years to make a barely playable MP Fallout 4 and they had two billion dollars to do it.
---
I have the same problem
---
Found your comment from 3 weeks ago just to let you know that the other fridge skins ARE standalone, you don't have to buy the previous versions
---
Please post your build, I'm super curious!
---
Same
---
It's a visual bug in the pipboy, you still have everything.
---
Yes but I played that event an insane amount of times to get them all.
---
 I still have 4 flag plans,3 cleaver plans and 3 tato salad recipes.
---
 I have a bunch of the bloody outfits and hats.
---
 I think I have 1 extra salt and 1 extra pepper plans as well
---
 I was going to wait a while before selling them but the 2nd meet week will drop the prices for sure
---
&gt;Bethesda sometimes break their promises. (For example with items in the atomic shop that give a gameplay advantage)
---
I agree with most of what you wrote, but I do take exception with the above. I know it's been beat to death...beat to a rather fine red paste, however show me where the word promise was ever used? Even if we assume they did promise, what exactly gives a competitive advantage?? You can't seriously mean the fridge or bot?
---
Yeah for 500 atoms
---
Bruh, yes. Last night I somehow had a mass sale of items from my shop. I started at 16k and then sales rolled in til I was at Max caps and started getting sales after I hit Max and I frantically got out of the game and back to my alt until I can spend caps. I usually like to keep my sweet spot at 25k. I agree fully
---
THE ARKTOS FRIDGE YESSSS
---
To add a note I do have 2 PS4s in my house so I used my stepdaughter's account and put her character on the drums so I got basically 2 rewards for every event.
---
it would depend on the rest of your build. junkies is a kind of different animal that reshuffles a lot of perks.
---
if you are solo i would keep lone wanderer. i just found that i ended up in groups frequently enough that it didn't really benefit me that much. on different characters i moved it to different places.
---
I guess my main thought would be that even a convenience perk that reduced weight or just helped in any other way constantly is better than a perk that i forgot to swap out and did nothing a lot of the time. if you need defense, that tells me you aren't stealth build (i'm guessing) so my first thought would be loading up convenience perks in endurance personally or luck. can always boost your xp by moving some over to int as well if you don't already have scrapper on full time or something. kind of a wide open thing without more information.
---
personally, the maintenance required on junkies to keep taking chems made it not a terribly fun build for me. dying already has nearly zero consequences other than picking up your junk, so bloodied still seems king for damage. if you don't wanna die, vanguard/vampire stuff seems to be a better way to go.
---
junkie's is in vogue at the moment though, and you *DO* get to recover a lot of perks and use them for more general improvement stuff if you run junkies I think.
---
but, again, any recommendation would then depend on what your current setup is. =P
---
/ramble
---
Just an icon tho
---
Any interest in parting with your extra mod plans? I have Salty already but I need Spicy and Peppered.
---
Np, and yeah I think it‚Äôs called North Mountain lookout or something similar but I‚Äôm not sure. There‚Äôs a scorchbeast that likes to hang around there.
---
It's the only other leather jacket I can think of offhand, but if I find another one, I'll let you know. You wouldn't be on PC, would you?
---
Wtf man. Those things that BOS are wearing are types of recon armors and I just mentioned it? Don't call me a troll. You don't know nothing about lore and you call people a troll when they be talking about things you don't know about
---
Spend caps faster?
---
I've played for about a week. And barely found content. I dont believe that having to pay for items whether they be building items or cosmetic makes the game better. Bottom line is people payed 60$ for a game that's incomplete, the story is lacking, and the lore spits on existing lore. Brotherhood of steel? Not a thing 20 years after the war. Why do I think the story is lacking? Well I've gotten up to the point where you gotta go to the top of the world and I still have no idea what the story of 76 is, news articles and youtubers filled me in on the story and its laughable. The majority of the quests you do are just filler quests to pass time to make the story longer. Now on to the issues! This game literally made me sick! The FOV and motion blur gives people motion sickness. Theres sun Ray's clipping through buildings and terrain.  Most enemies are glitch out or invisible (given they fixed it somewhat but it still happens) every patch they make results in old bugs becoming a thing again. Now on to the world. I live near point pleasant wv. Now with that being said ( I know the divergence was around WW2) why the fuck is the river the size of a damn stream? About the only thing they did to capture west Virginia is the damn song and the mpthman statue. They could've done something to the ohio side of the river (theres a big ass city of Galliapolis ohio across from point pleasant) but instead let's go for the bare minimum. Hell they could have made the TNT plant where you first meet mothman (that's where the first sighting of him was so why not?) This game had a chance but it failed to live up to what bethesda is capable of producing. This many issues in a game produced by a AAA company is sad and sickening. You can compare it to no man's sky all you want but the difference between the two companies is developer size. 
---
I'm glad people can find this game fun I really am. But I just cant. Bethesda done fucked it up. Oh and the camp shields that are a thing now? The result of someone nuking Pete Hines base! Shits a joke anymore.
---
You can't drop them on the ground, so it's pretty hard.
---
I use mine all the time as an alternative to the benches to keep the weight manageable.
---
Oh, ok, how can you tell?
---
Thanks. Now I can be a little disappointed now instead of a lot disappointed later.
---
Just move your camp to a new location.
---
Or cause it's actually trash. The people who play it are trying to justify the 60+ dollars they spent on it
---
If you cant target it then you'll have to move it.
---
The game world doesn't work? Which part? The ground? The buildings? The trees? Does the sickleman was here graffiti jump off the wall and do a little dance?
---
Uruguay.
---
Current workaround is to crouch while reloading
---
I'm curious as to what games you are refferencing... would love to play some that function as you describe.
---
Fast travelled to the purveyor, 875 scrip. Says 0 in the pipboy.
---
Doubt it.
---
I always keep 8 on me and use any above that. The difference between 150% and 200% is negligible when you factor in the savings on ballistic fiber.
---
Doable, yes.  It's risky (though dying has little penalty obviously).  I've seen bloodied melee do fine there, and that's a much bigger risk.
---
Good if you can keep yourself safe (up on a fence is about as safe as you can get).  Personally I wouldn't go in with 5% health, you can bump that up a ways for the queen without gimping yourself.
---
Wait did they release more raider items this week??
---
Press RB when hovering an emote when it gives you the option
---
Every single item you mention is already in the works: tagging legendaries,  text chat on PC and a lot of other QoL items. Personally,  I think text chat is going to be just like the push to talk bitchfest...Beth will go out of the way to add it and people still won't use it, they'll just find something else to bitch about...to the detriment of actual content.
---
I thought the review bombs dropped on November 14th
---
Yea, Ultima Online tried that in 1999 ...
---
So let me ask you this ... whats keeping the criminal from just, logging out? Or from running with a team of 3 non criminal people? Even if you can put a bounty on him (as you can in PvP), whats keeping his teammates from collecting that.
---
So, No ... its been tried, and the Player Killers will win 99% of the times, simply because they are prepared for PvP, when most regular players are not
---
Pretty much. Pieces devalue berserker's? Wtf are you even trying to say?
---
They don't "unequip for a random reason", you have to do it yourself.
---
You clearly don't understand how either works.
---
It looks like you forgot how to spell Mississippi
---
2 things: First, you need to make sure they're selected in the Atom Shop.  You can buy emotes, but unless you click on them again to select them (I think you'll see a check on the box in the AS) you can use them in-game. Next, you need to update your emote wheel to add them. Not sure what you play on, but on PC you open the wheel and then press Q on the spot where the emote goes to select what you want to use. For instance, you'd go to "wave", hit Q and replace with "commie salute".
---
im pretty sure that on the emote wheel, find the main emote catagory you want (like I have 2 options for asking people to do a group photo) and hover over it or push to right will expand the versions of that type, and your new one should be in there.
---
Fallout 4 sold almost 15 million copies compared to fallout 76s 2.5 million
---
They are all perfect examples of games that basically do what do is trying to do but well have made it work.. they may not work perfectly but most of them run better and have better support via mods than Fo76 will probably ever receive..

Star citizen is really getting there (in another ten years)
---
I could go on.. all these games achieve and working open work maybe the games aren‚Äôt as good in your opinion to Fo76 but nearly all of them function and work as a better open game world than Fo76 in its current state
---
Yes I meant 10 maximum sorry friend.
---
What a let down. I thought they wanted people to spend atoms.. I'm tired of raiders. We had raider an scabbers for too long. So many reskins. I guess this week the only thing I can justify is the dart board being reasonable priced.
---
[Damage/health regen bug was reintroduced with Patch 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d7yabb/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Sadly,no I didn't .however that was a few years back,and if don't keep familiarized with the remote I will forget what every button does.he and his friend are currently passionate about Don't starve together on PC, and my daughter only plays with her boyfriend(not fallout76 currently) So for now I'll play alone and pretend to be a 5-7 yr old so people will be impressed with my playing style .
---
I ended up having to do it solo the other day and it wasn't hard. Just stock up on the greens and critters Durning the event and drop all at once.
---
have to test today's patch but not getting my hopes high
---
I would love this
---
*Grafton's Mayor hated that*
---
Before they nerfed the weapon dmg down to nothing you could reasonably aim and shoot a stealthboi user and kill them before they got close enough to Tesla. After the nerfs people became sitting ducks so that sort of bullshittery was on the rise.
---
It's hard to keep my hopes up with many of the things Bethesda says they're going to do.
---
If people wouldn't buy it, they wouldn't do it.
---
I agree, sorry I should do a more concrete statement
---
We had scabbers an raiders.. raiders stuff has been going on too long. They need to start giving out some new stuff instead of reskined raider stuff. An start rotating other faction bundles back in.
---
I like playing FO76. However, Meat week is the grindiest, most boring, low-reward event ever. The camp was kind of fun to play with at first, but really--YAWN!
---
A free handy man for all would be too much for Beth
---
We expected it to be bug ridden bit not as bad as it is. The game literally gets people sick!
---
I think the raider stuff has ended... at least the datamines are complete.
---
&gt;because most of the space is just forests, and the lack of humans make it feel lifeless.
---
So, when wastelanders comes out and you get your NPCs, then what will you bitch about? Hmmmm. Dialog trees not deep enough? Dialog trees too deep and confusing? Too few NPCs? Too many NPCs?
---
I get what you keep trying to say, but I think we also tryna say it‚Äôs hard to ENJOY THE WORLD when you are consistently pulled out of it. Sure, it‚Äôs large and can be interesting.  But I have yet to have a solid session where I can get immersed and appreciate it. Because of that, I‚Äôd rather call the devs out on their shit so they can get it to the point where I can live in the game and truly be a wastlander
---
I want Halloween decorations!!
---
Bye
---
Building sometimes don‚Äôt open.. or you have to open doors multiple times.. floating trees.. 2quick examples my guy.. buggy game translates into the state of the game world we perceive..
---
What was wrong with it?
---
So? I already agreed the FO76 sales were poor, but that wasn't the point.
---
‚ÄúThe War That Never Was‚Äù I‚Äôm pretty sure has been out of rotation since BETA days.
---
None of it is worth anything.
---
The person who made it just likes it better than the rest.
---
That‚Äôs how pricing works on cosmetic items.
---
Or supply drops in general will have money as well not just at the airport
---
Lol, it's been gone for a while? I got it when it first came around a long time ago. Guess I never noticed.
---
Soooooo nobody is playing this game?
---
The Scabber Handmade skin cost 700 as well
---
Yow guy
---
Is the red rare? I got one from a vendor for 50c out fit + hat
---
Been playing since Easter and I‚Äôve never seen it. 
---
It‚Äôs in the VDSG and I‚Äôve heard BETA players talk about it but I‚Äôve never seen it - and I think I‚Äôve seen all the events in rotation at this point with the exception of Faschnaught.
---
Sadly its not however if you crouch while reloading it fixes the issue 100%
---
Arktos Pharma Fridge though
---
This does not work for shotguns at least. Whenever I leave the world or whenever Bethesda decides to quit the game for me I still have the health regen damage bug upon reloading.
---
Is Hunter vs Hunted a viable alternative? I never tried it but was thinking about it
---
I'm saying it's bad. Because it's pushing providers to release games that are not fully polished and then hoping that the customer will *pay* for the fixes down the line. That's a crappy service right there.
---
I am very concerned with Bethesda releasing game altering content in the Atom Shop when they *promised* that wouldn't happen. I am very concerned with their need to push overpriced reskins over fixes to *known* bugs. And not even bugs that were an issue from the B.E.T.A.-that-wasn't-a-beta, but bugs that were an issue from FO4's release and have never been fixed. 
---
If *that* is the future for Bethesda games going forward, then I'm going to be done with Bethesda games. And that's a real shame because I typically greatly enjoy their games. I just want the games to be finished *before* release. I will buy expansions or even a subscription if I enjoy the game. I do it for ESO after all. But if they want full price right out the gate, I need the game to be *finished* and fully functional right out the gate.
---
This is what I was thinking.. how does a golden 50 cal go for cheaper?? When the rifle is just a dark shade of black an duct tape?
---
Because it is likely going to be higher demand than the other skins. If you don't like the new price vote with your wallet
---
Why should I praise them for a world when due to various bugs, server issues, and to be blunt - other people - ruin the experience for me?
---
I got an immense amount of hate when I suggested this once.  I don‚Äôt even said that the greyed out items shouldn‚Äôt count towards the items you are shown to have for sale, but people were pissed.
---
The dartboard that is just for show and doesn't work? They need a working one. And then when they get a working one, fix this one to be like that one
---
It is a difficult subject ...
---
Look, I understand that some people wanna PvP, and wish for a better PvP environment. But this cannot go onto the back of the PvE players, who, well, carry this game. 
---
Heck, I'm sad the PvP servers are going away, already seen an influx of wanna-be killers
---
Wasn't the Ceiling Fan always 500 atoms? Why is on the Atomic Sale tab?
---
&gt;There should still be human npcs though, look at the other fallout games
---
The other fallouts are way off in the future...fortunately for you, you'll get your NPCs, in wastelanders, in another 1.5 months or so...and for free. Go figure
---
Funny coz I play it, and I see other people playing it, and the two 76 subs I follow have traffic, sooo...
---
Yes, the red asylum worker uniform is the most rare of all of them.  You could get some top tier weapons for it.
---
As a melee fighter I always forget the needs of the ammo-bound :)
---
Fallout 76 is #233 of the most watched list on twitch. Its dying. The first impression killed all Hope's for the game hell ots under anthem.....
---
I once did follow me to show a teammate a disease cure I dropped for them. They thought I wanted to fight
---
I think they should reintroduce them but take a harder look at each individual weapon and class to bring them all in line with one another. The fire rate on auto lasers makes explosive effects insane. But the key is to bring other weapons in line with it, not just nerf it.
---
But you can kill brahmin without becoming wanted and there a camp item.
---
Ok a few people play it so that means it's not dying out?
---
Right, it was, thanks for pointing that out!  Same question still applies though, why does Bethesda think some gun skins are worth more real-world money than others.
---
I'm aware. I'm a CAMP builder an love making realistic CAMPS. It would go great in my pub in my current build https://youtu.be/-vfrblbWJjk But I could never justify 300 atoms on a single dart board, 180 is reasonable.
---
Because drama gets views. Got 1k plus hrs myself and still find things to entertain me and diacover things i missed.
---
If it matters you feel better the slay bells skin I accidentally bought cost 900
---
I don't meant to say ackshually but it came out later but still back in 2018
---
I wanted to come back and correct my self. I was incorrect in my statement about 3 being bugged.
---
Not as bad as me buying a 7$ fridge twice to get a skin. Fml.
---
I believe that this is one of the most asked for skins among the posts I‚Äôve seen. 
---
It‚Äôs no surprise that Beth charged more for it.
---
I just scrap the wire.
---
You have us to show this too :) well done!!
---
They don't drop from treasure maps.
---
Time will tell. It's obviously still enough people for them to continue supporting the game.
---
Do you still play it?
---
Guess I got lucky the dude had no idea what he had. I dont understand they appeal of them honestly. I love unique outfits but the asylum just seems boring to me.
---
Bless you for this post. Game Changer.
---
While it was not perfect, once playing survival I found adventure to lack any kind of thrill. 
---
I did not avoid PvP, but I did not seek it out (most of the time). My thrill was wandering the wasteland, forced to walk, forced to make decisions based on risk vs reward.
---
I won't boldly claim that my play time is going to decrease or that I am walking out the door. However, I have spent the last two weeks trying to mentally prepare for this day and find some degree of joy in adventure. Thus far I have not found what I am looking for.
---
Can say that about any game that 'looks' good, nothing short of face value appreciation. the art team is doing wonders but the coding side is almost as barren in relationship to interactivity and functionality as the games atmosphere, and that's not a good thing. 
---
The loot being so bad as if borderlands only dropped the same 5 weapon types, and the lack of original items makes you have no feeling of worth or achievement in any equipment you get from most quests. This type of game would be okay in 2009 but in 2019 that's like the expectation from an indie title. 
---
The Development team seem to cling to their broken engine like a person trying to keep a rust bucket of a car in working condition, they simple won't admit the fact it needs a complete redesign or that other existing engines could do much more for less the hassle of this one.
---
There are core issues within Bethesda Softworks that they can't simply plug up with a piece of gum, because that gum loses it's stickiness and falls out.
---
I was wrong. Rank 1 and 3 do work. 2 does not. u/Eckserah looked into it and provided proof of rank 1 and 3.
---
https://imgur.com/a/xjblMHu
---
Sorry, is it reload while crouched or crouch during a reload?
---
They don't select Atomic Shop items based on what people on Reddit and the forums say/want.
---
They have weight? That probably explains my recent weight issues.
---
1 and 3 work. 2 does not.
---
Mines gone too
---
Brass knuckles only
---
Wait what why did they kill survival :'(
---
Reload while crouched they say
---
I think Serendipity in the Luck section helps a lot.
---
Activates at 30% health or under
---
I made a 2nd character just to use the Unstoppable Monster.
---
I havnt had much experience with it though
---
You don‚Äôt think they follow consumer demand?
---
I still give them credit, for the "world" they created at launch. Remember that? Remember what it was marketed as? You going to keep trusting and defending them a year later when the damage bug is still in the game? Cool, you do you.
---
Serendipity, nerd rage,  damage reduction armor, dodgy
---
I think you have to travel to the location to trigger the event
---
No I dont. I stopped playing it after getting sick for the 5th time and running out of shit to do(never completed the story because its trash and boring). Just enough people to get them to break the whole "only cosmetics" in the store to milk the rest of you for all they can. Hell anthem still had support when they were failing.
---
Don't buy things the moment they come out. Likely they will bring out the better items a week or so later and the old stuff will be on sale in a month. I new they would do this with the fridge and I was right, they've added an arkos pharma fridge today aswell. 
---
Give it a couple weeks the silver one will be vaulting and part of a A1000 bundle.
---
&gt;The ground?
---
Yes, on more than one occasion the game has had issues similar to FO4 where the ground renders funny and results in it looking like there is dirt where it shouldn't be.  
---
I have also had situations where after dying or something being dropped the bag was inaccessible due to the way it was designed. 
---
&gt;The buildings?
---
Yes actually, I have had some buildings (in particular the building where you trade in legendaries) be blocked off for me - I see people inside, but the doors are still blocked.  The other common one this happens to me on is the building with Bev. 
---
&gt;The trees?
---
Yes, the game is inconsistent with the way the bulldozer works, and I will frequently return to my camp with trees sticking out of it. 
---
So yes, there are times in which the world itself does not function properly.
---
Chameleon is usually the 5th piece
---
Then try coming back around Halloween? It's October 1st, did you show up to work today dressed in a costume with a bowl full of candy?
---
This is what I've been saving all my atoms for lol Also hoping to see a cool Halloween costume...fingers crossed!
---
How is that hard to test? It lasts 7 seconds. We have damage numbers.
---
The damage doesn't increase after the first hit.
---
They definitely do. Also I‚Äôm sure they have stats on which weapons are used the most. So making skins for those would be most profitable.
---
No shit, it's in the section of items that's getting rotated out.
---
Lol, then why do you give a fuck?
---
Evasive to
---
I recently just switched to a bloodied build an o dont have any issues. Running blocker an nerd rage an serendipity with a good set of armor an I do just fine. The only things that give me issues are yao guai have been seemed to be buffed an mire lurk kings. But mostly everything is dead before they get near me with my vats build.
---
Evasive and Barbarian are also good for damage reduction
---
How does this impact harvesting?
---
If they didn‚Äôt they‚Äôd be making a mistake. Don‚Äôt you remember all the posts begging Beth for a fridge? Or for faction themed items? Soon after we were seeing them in the shop.
---
It's not a reskin, it's literally the same station on sale because it's getting vaulted.
---
Wearing armour gives you DR, having DR devalues the Berserker benefit, how thick are you?
---
The fact that I have to explain that you shows how little you know. 
---
What happens if I need to put on a Hazmat suit? Oops armour is unequipped have to re-start the whole armour process. 
---
Get the fuck out of here.
---
Because it was already dead
---
If 3 works they just fixed it because it did nothing last week.

I think most of the answers in this link will apply.
---
TLDR: Kill fast before something kills you. We all die within a couple hits, so don't take so many hits without healing. I personally stressed it is more about forethought walking into something and adjusting your health accordingly.

Flamer isn't too bad on its own for a heavy weapon, it can just rip through fuel faster than anything I've seen. Long as she doesn't need the rads it's a useful thing. 
---
Sidenote for armour, stay outta power armour, and look into vanguard, life saving and autostim (don't go afk with autostim equipped)
---
This build has been one of my favourites and has felt the most unique without too much maintenance.
---
I have a few things in my vendors set to max caps so I don't accidentally scrap them. A few of those items won't fit in display cases.
---
The fridge and electron we're planned in the game from the beginning.  So were faction-based cosmetics.  Reddit demand did not result in those things existing.
---
Nooo survival was the only good thing they did!! All it needed was a quicker travel method like a Subway
---
"an online video game which can be played by a very large number of people simultaneously"
---
Some people would say 24 is a large number or even 54 (I think that's their battle royal mode player count)

because the end game is a bullet sponge nuke habitat that is boring and repetitive with poor rewards within a poor loot system.
---
I think the real question is, when will the fallout fanboys realize this game is terrible?
---
Exactly...add in the countless God like weapons many of us have lost due to bugs, quest items lost due to bugs, time lost due to bugs, should I keep going?
---
Crashed on me last night as a group of us were fighting the Queen - she was down to maybe 10% health... and then freeze, back to the menu screen.  Felt a tingle of rage, considering I had just spent a ton of ammo, shrugged my shoulders instead - game has frozen on me plenty of times, but can't remember it happening during a Queen fight... and I immediately thought this was tied to Meat week for some reason, well, at least I got a lot of xp from killing all the enemies that spawn nearby.
---
That‚Äôs a nice thought!  I‚Äôll go with this.
---
Again, not the point the OP made. I get that you want to win a discussion, but changing the topic doesn't make you right.
---
yeah really, &lt;----- not a raider......
---
Damn I saw forrest yesterday for I guess cheap as well 200c? What are the prices for them usually?
---
for me as I played it solo as I dont have a group of friends that are into anything close to an rpg type game. its definetly big and looks nice when things actually are loaded up but for me it felt big and empty. It was fun even tho it was by far the buggiest game I have ever played by far but its slightly understandable since I feel a game the size of fallout shouldnt be online. might get better with the npc but the world feels so empty and boring alot of the time once I finished that "main story" if you can call it that  I stopped playing soon after from boredom and frustration with bugs
---
Niiiiiiice.  - kinda sad there is no discount if you bought the steel fridge üòí
---
They have stats on what is used in game, yes.  That's part of how they decide what gets added to the shop. But they are not going "Hey, Reddit says they'll spend money on this, let's add it right away".
---
Truth
---
Lol you don't even know the basics of your build.
---
Broken armor adds no dr but still gives you the  legendary effects/stealth mod bonuses.

If you need rad resist use PA. Day one stuff bud.

Those moldy helmets aren't even Bethesda. They're GameStop or some shit. They have permission to get merch made in the likeness of fallout shit, and they had the moldy helmet made by some cheap company not the people Bethesda used to make their helmets. They're getting all the flak for a fuck up done by a different company just because it looks like fallout stuff.
---
This is like if GameStop made their own Xbox controller battery and that battery exploded. The fault wouldn't be Xbox's. It would be GameStop's. Even if someone died, Xbox wouldn't catch that lawsuit. GameStop would.
---
They 100% are though. Refrigerators were recommended on reddit for example.

Wow they really milking tire sets. This is the third set. Just a different color

Survival mode isn't going anywhere, actually Bethesda said that they're gonna disconnect the servers for focusing more on wastelanders DLC so that means they're going to put survival mode again after launching wastelanders.
---
Have faith people.
---
I've always thought that. I assumed it was an in-game joke
---
Technically there's a new Arktos-themed fridge, but it's the same model as the stainless steel one.
---
Same price, too...
---
A few more Nuka Cola themed items would be nice also. Nuka Cola pip boy and something besides the weird cooler super glued to my back. And I will gladly pay 300-500 atoms a pop for weapon skins, especially ones like the Raider handmades and Free States where you get multiple skins for the same weapon or 1 themed skin for multiple weapons.
---
Certain legendary prefixes would essentially stop working.
---
Oooh man, I was going to answer but I blue screened...
---
Wow. Your 9 story Serenity in Seneca is really nice! Do you know if there is a limit to camp height other than the challenge of finding the right terrain to build a tall camp?
---
dude, I've been playing since 3, I know my lore, and they are not called recon suits, you pulled that out your ass because you are a troll.  I know you mentioned it, then you went on to say underarmor under power armor isn't lore friendly, that's why I think you are a troll, you contradict yourself and say stupid shit, either that or you are a dumb kid
---
is fallout 76 the only multiplayer game youve ever played? compared to other titles fitting its genre its not that amazing. fallout 76 has triple A price but has bugs that have existed since fallout 4 lol
---
* survival aspects bare minimum. eat/drink to stay alive and forget about it
---
* basebuilding is good - but camp budget kinda ruins the fun a lot. plus the availability of structures to make unique designs is sort of missing. not to mention the various bugs with basebuilding that has existed since fallout 4
---
* graphics / optimization: decent graphics but look at a game like the division 1 or 2. graphics are light years ahead and one of those games game out before 76 and one started development around the sametime as 76. f76 graphic assets are borderline trash. just looks like the least amount of effort went into making those environment objects. optimization is pretty terrible as well 
---
bethesda didn't do anything ground breaking or extraordinary with fo76. it's a relatively generic title but the big difference is that it's got the fallout name to it. not going to praise bethesda for doing the bare minimum. we should have bugs that have existed from previous titles. we shouldnt have P2W creep, shouldnt have quality of life improvements that have been asked for since launch be constantly ignored
---
What money are they milking? I bought the game. Didn't even pay full price for it. Try again.
---
No but the Atom shop has a shinny new Raider key ring you can purchase!
---
I love that the map is huge, and it's pretty. However, I've felt like it's kind of been in BETA since its actual release. I think they kind of set themselves up for failure knowing it wasn't finished, and released it anyway. Their "We'll continue to try to fix/finish it if people keep playing" mentality kind of threw me off. I would have rather it have been delayed, and pay for DLC's instead of the route they chose, but that's just me. I hope they can get back on track, because I love all the Fallout games. This one just felt unfinished, more so than the rest, (history of bugs, lack of a lot of story content, or the way it was presented overall) Credit is due for making it pretty to look at, but not to play in. I think if they manage to pull off Wastelanders, they should finally get credit for a finished game....if there is more than just a little content, story, lore, and definitely less bugs in game. Like I said, it's beautiful, but the bugs make it so frustrating to actually play. That's why the beautiful world space and huge map have been overlooked. People remember bad interactions far longer than good ones. I'm not trying to be a Negative Nacy, just my opinion on why there's so much hate surrounding it.

What do you mean by that? I can name 5 other titles that have come before fo76 that have game worlds that blow fallout 76 out of the water
---
Ok one person doesn't mean that same as the community.....
---
Same fucking difference.  Halloween is literally thirty days away, that's four weeks worth of possible atom shop updates.
---
So, it didn't occur to anyone at Bethesda to add a fridge to the game until people on Reddit started asking for it? The fridge was planned to be in the game from the beginning. The posts about it on Reddit are not what made it exist.
---
Yea but for most people it‚Äôs too late. Unless you are part of a hardcore crowd that comes to reddit to reply in threads to specifically tell people it‚Äôs getting better, people haven‚Äôt looked back after the initial experience.
---
Personally, gonna need those mods and private servers they lied about. üëåüèª

The world is stunning! They did such a good job making it feel lived in, yet abandoned at the same time!

This is awesome! Thanks for sharing.

Radshark dragging me off the shore
---
Sorry. It's nothing like an MMO.  It's much much closer to the Division than World of Warcraft or ESO.  It's a looter shooter with RPG elements.
---
I'm pissed about this one. Wanted it to be a skin for my fridge. This is the reason we should have had thr base one ingame and skins to buy.
---
Yep they need to bring back weapon skin bundles. Feels like good value usually. I know tons of backpacks have been datamined, guess we just need to wait. I'm glad this fridge released so soon though
---
Being my first 76 character I figured I might need to. 4 was a different beast, I was mostly intel then.
---
The way I look at it is if you payed a guy full price for a ford but it had old go kart parts on the inside. Yea it looks good from the outside, and runs, but it's not what I payed for. I payed full price for a game that legitimately seems still not finished, and besides the landscape (which is no small feat) it seems most everything has been ported from other games, and even resold to us for an insane amount higher than we have payed for it before. Like, hundreds of times higher.
---
If you want real answers, you won‚Äôt get it pandering to this sub.
---
Stealth is key. I run wood with a leather chest unyielding strength sentinel set.
---
While sneaking it's close to max sneak and out of sneak I get sentinel.
---
I run my gear broken so my dr is 300, only thing that gets me regularly out of stealth is legendary behemoth hits.
---
I never repair anything but my weapon.
---
More needs to always rain
---
Ok so we are focusing on definition and what the game feels like rather than the issues that are affecting people's health...
---
Steadily raising the price of everything to get less backlash is the way their game is played.
---
Survival had a interesting timeline:
---
PVP players: we need a pvp server;
---
Bethesda: OK, create survival server;
---
PVP players: need to nerf the survival, we lost a lot when die (chems,caps);
---
Bethesda: Balance and make loss less items;
---
PVP players: We keep geting killed with one shoot;
---
Bethesda: Balance the damage;
---
PVP players: i cant kill players and got almost nothing when i finaly kill one, lets go to Adventure mode;
---
Bethesda: Pvp server is a ghost town, lets kill it;
---
The End...
---
You could be correct. May I ask how this is known?
---
A group of friends did something like this a while ago and it was super fun. No armour, only black powder and revolutionary swords
---
Quad explosive 10mm are that sought after?
---
Fishin with ‚Äònades would be quicker
---
You are a genius. Thank you! ü§ó
---
And *that's* the real answer.
---
Location does help quite a bit though, I do a lot of sales selling only high-end weapons at slightly above average prices outside of timed events like meat week, nukes etc.
---
Exposure to more eyes ultimately leads to more sales, however you‚Äôre right in that knowing what sells is still the best tactic, because nobody gonna pay 10k for a hunters exploding bashing Handmade.
---
Dr is a waste of points for bloodied.
---
I think it‚Äôd be a dope addition as well,but I‚Äôve thought this since Fallout 3,(which was my cherrybreaker Falloutwise)
---
But I mean,I feel like they should have implemented that from jump,like Fallout 1
---
It‚Äôd be a welcome addition too me,nothin too fancy,just the ability too cast a pole,wait for a bite,
---
&amp; let the RNG roll
---
I can only speak for myself. Anyway, what concern is it of yours if people do want to spend more money on it? Typical fucking keyboard warrior who doesn't like something, but instead of just moving on like a normal person you stick around to tell everyone else why they're wrong, like we're supposed to care about your boring opinion.
---
The sale page just lists items and everyday different item from that page is reduced, so you need to check it everyday to get the sale prices.
---
Okay my dude think what you want. They are 100% taking recommendations from reddit that get a lot of attention. It would be stupid not to it‚Äôs free ideas.
---
Thanks man I‚Äôll add you
---
What a shock, we've already bounced from people complaining that Bethesda is spending too much time and effort on the atom shop to complaining Bethesda is not spending enough time adding new stuff to the atom shop.
---
wtf oven mitt, shinny?!
---
It happens a lot though, with backpacks as an example, it'll be the same with the Collectron. Of course you're not gonna want to use this fridge everywhere, like the old one looked good in kitchens, this one not so much. There's also a Nuka cola fridge coming out. I'm glad I don't have to pay 700 atoms for a fridge and then 2-300 atoms for another skin
---
I could post my build if you would like to take a look.
---
I do believe you don't know exactly how Junkies work. They made withdrawl effects permanent unless you take Addictol. So you pick five that don't impact your special too much, get addicted once and then get a 50% damage boost. I could be wrong though. So I don't need to carry extra chems or maintain my damage boost more than once.
---
That wasnt pvpers complaining. Lol pvpers didnt kill surivial, pacifist builds did.
---
Erm, last time I check, wearing PA removes armour. 
---
And, to get broken armour, you need to wear it while it breaks. While getting it broken it gives you DR. If you have DR, Berserker doesn‚Äôt work as well. 
---
I would offer you to for double stupidity with your next post but I‚Äôm out of crayons to reply with.
---
probably because none of them talk about real issues the game has (like pre patch 13 PA bug being back for a solid month again)
---
i mean fuck nobody even covered the "lost gear guy" story at all, which was a major issue for some players (and woulda got hella clicks)
---
nope gotta go off on a tangent about something a subcontractor did wrong, or about x item is overpriced.  or better yet, lets talk about old already patched issues, because they cant do basic research for games they dont even play.
---
Like I've said before if you scroll up. I'm glad people can find enjoyment in this game. But dont try a polish a turd but making it sound amazing. Dont buy the scrap collector bot or the weapons in the store. Dont reward scummy practices
---
To be fair to fallout 4, it had SOME diversity, like the urban areas of Boston, Cambridge, and Charlestown, the scorched earth of the Glowing Sea, and the clear fields of the other areas
---
See? Why did everyone cry foul that the Collectron was p2w? Bethesda are handing out a free Mr. Handy to players.
---
Star Wars Galaxies had it. It was essentially a turn based mini game but the fish provided unique resources. I thought it was pretty cool.
---
Pacifist builds stay all the time on adventure server.
---
It‚Äôs been around. I‚Äôm guessing they were waiting for it to go on sale like I was. It looks classy.
---
Fallout 76's world keeps me coming back time and time again. Too bad the social menu is borked and too bad there are a bazillion reasons to rag on this game but the world itself, the design and execution are quite nice. Too bad it's not optimized etc etc etc but I sure do love rad storms, thuderstorms, rain etc and the god rays are amazing when they are not coming out of the side of a hill
---
Does he need to be in a spot where he can physically get out in the world?  If not I was just going to stash him on the roof.
---
There should be 3 individual spawns that will pander to different level gaps. West side of the map should be lower leveled/easier monsters.
---
It‚Äôs there so you know who remembers the old dude from Gremlins and what he called the little critter, hahaha. 
---
‚Äúyow gwy‚Äù seems the closest to me but its also been a couple decades since ive seen the movie. 
---
Of course, how correct the pronunciation was used there is also debatable :P
---
LOL
---
If you obsessed with min-max'ing, yes.
---
If you would rather survive...
---
No. No they dont looool. Food builds killed surivial
---
even the "news of the week" prior to it was just as bad before the story broke.
---
"if you still play 76, YOU ARE THE PROBLEM"
---
Legendary Fish
---
Someone needs a hug..
---
You're the one who can't make a simple build work because you are too lazy to sit near a rad roach.
---
There's no reason to use a hazmat or PA.
---
SBQ only requires it if the person launching has no idea how it works and the raid is a waste of time.
---
Rad storms are a little more than rare. I'm about 80 hours in and I honestly don't recall seeing a radstorm.
---
You can play darts in real life.
---
Just saying.
---
[Juicehead](https://www.youtube.com/user/juiceheadiscool) would like to: *Know your location*
---
If the system is broken, what's the point?
---
This is just protecting the griefers more than anything else.
---
Accused? Step on up, clear your name.
---
So we should shit on the world design team, and deny them all praise they might deserve because the team responsible for filling that world with content shit the bed?
---
That's like if one child drew a wonderful picture and you put it on the fridge, but your other cold scribbled the words "shitty fuck cunt" on the paper, and then both children proceed to be punished.
---
Whether it works or not, is not the responsibility or the fault of the team who designed the world. They're not the game designers and coders. They're the artists and what not who design the models of the creatures (nicely done on a lot of those), and the world itself. They deserve all their praise.
---
Don't shit on the beautiful landscape just because some crappy people decided to pollute and corrupt the area around it. You can appreciate good art and the artist who created it, without having to appreciate the rude and unpleasant asshole that brought it to the art gallery.
---
Not every team that worked on the game is to blame for the bugs and what not. Many of them aren't even hired as programmers. They're graphic designers and what not too.
---
I can agree with you on SBQ vs Imposter. I guess I'll have to test to see if Suppressor helps me stay alive. I'm more worried about things like Project Paradise. The Alphas hit like a damn truck and dying repeatedly doesn't matter much aside from the fact that within that time frame, the friendly animals die.
---
Not an issue.  Power Armor or you take your chances.
---
It what you think it‚Äôs worth. I traded for the red dress yesterday and it felt like the best day ever. I‚Äôm a girl so the dress probably means more to me than it would a guy. I traded a white responder helmet and 2 backpack mods. I know that I probably traded way over but to be honest all the stuff I offered he could of had it all and I‚Äôd still been happy. It means I‚Äôve completed my collection and I can now stop serving hopping Fort Defiance and actually play the game.
---
Thanx
---
It is an icon.  Nothing more.
---
It's an inefficient system, you'd survive better without it. Can't take damage if everything dies instantly.
---
You are part of the problem. If you don't like reading negative criticism, go ahead and take your own advice .
---
not a problem.  
---
Saw you had translated to English - and I know English can be weird.
---
I'd love a new trailer, I live for the Fallout montages with the 50s tunes as backdrop, like [the second half of the e3 trailer for 3](https://youtu.be/iYZpR51XgW0). The one for Wild Appalachia was great too.
---
There's Serendipity, Fire Proof, Evasive. Maybe a couple others? But mainly dying doesn't really "do" anything except make you respawn. I don't keep lots of junk on me, and so when I die it doesn't even matter.
---
Food builds stays on adventure.
---
***STARES MOTHERFUCKERLY IN COLLECTRON BOT***
---
I've been building fuel on my main to counteract that cost. 
---
Wasn't planning on using power armor so thank you for the tip. Wont autostim armor be redundant with the perk that autostims you? 
---
Autostim afk tip is MVP. I never thought about that until you mentioned it. That could be devastating to your stimpack stores!
---
I got the blackbird hunting rifle skin. It‚Äôs a bit underwhelming on the buttstock. No red, just extra dirty. I guess I was hoping the aligned stock (the one that looks like polymer) would be dresses up a little with some red or military accents.
---
Getting pretty bad when I have to change game play expecting a crash.
---
Now I have to make sure I capture the loot after every kill as it might be the last one before a crash. Normally I would have kill..kill.kill... then loot the bodies...
---
Awesome. My son and I play the game together too. Thanks Bethesda!
---
Yeah sometimes it is, but look I'm talking to you in english.
---
Unless you can glitch into the rock aswell you are S.O.L.
---
Custom map making for players to host yhere on mini games
---
Small side note, is the atom store broken for anyone else? I can‚Äôt seem to move around in the tabs. I can only scroll up and down on the side.
---
Nah still have the raider collectron, one more gas mask, a flag and another underarmor with a skull belt
---
Not quite, there's still at least the raider scrapbot to go.
---
I said 'types' of recon armor. Of course it's different. Jesus Christ you talk like that Cathy Newman lady
---
Eeh, the perk could be a good tradeoff to allow you to have more vanguard stuff. Yeah, starvation and dehydration will use up your stims a whole lot, I learned that the hard way. If you need more try chemist and super duper or pharma farmer at Morgantown airport
---
Keycards crates usually have 100 prewar money as well.
---
Much credit to you for that - I would not be able to reciprocate :)
---
What's a food build?
---
I must have missed the other spawns, I thought I looked around the map for them, but maybe not.
---
No you're wrong and I know that for a fact. Its obivious you're trolling now.
---
I've never seen an outfit spawn...it's the last one I need. I've read 20k and up. I actually think it's rarer than the red. But the hats spawn EVERY time. Green and brown outfits are the more common of the outfit colors.
---
This is something I can agree with.. however not at one point have I ‚Äúshat‚Äù on the designers or the game world.. I have simply stated that: 
---
1) the game world is broken and immersion breaking
---
2) there are other games that do Fo76s job well better..
---
3) MY OPINION: which is clearly not a sole opinion.. that is I do not believe until FO76 is up to par with other games of it genre and works to full basically full functionality, Bethesda deserves no praise for this one.. I am not wrong for expressing thatü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I actually chuckle at the notion of "It's Grafton's Major! But you knew that.. Who else would it be!"
---
They knew exactly what they were doing when they coined that cunt. Well played Bethesda!
---
First off, camp shields? Gonna have to Google that. 
---
Secondly, I totally agree. The game is an absolute joke and whose current success and player base is credited only to it being a "Fallout" Game. If this was a random Title you found in the Store it wouldnt have made it a month. 
---
The story is extremely lacking, with a few cool tid bits here and there, and a multiplayer mechanic that is just all over the place.
---
Weak build built around carry weight and farming perks, with no dps or defensive focus.
---
Forest is 20K
---
How would that have ruined survival? Genuine question
---
I'd like a Hot Rod suit &amp; hat, sorta like the 4th of July suit and hat but with flames. Just like the hot rod station :) that would be sweet!
---
Sometimes everyone's at ash heap. It's guaranteed scrip. Even got a 3* from that sheepsquach tho mostly its a 1*
---
If you're close to your 15 meats no need to do harder ones and maybe miss legendary.
---
What's the point of having broken armor?
---
for real
---
Loaded into a server, before I could even move my character, CAMP and I were destroyed by a nuke zone. *Trombone sound*
---
Yow-gwai
---
Haha! If it makes you feel any better, I've been playing for AT LEAST 8 months, and have one character. She's level 61. I play regularly, but just... do my own thing, leveling be damned. So your play style is probably less childlike than mine...
---
Wtf, don't you wait until the day of Halloween to put up decorations?
---
Yea, after you've been around long enough, you realize that anything that isn't a bundle exclusive will show up on sale eventually so if you don't need it right away, it's better to wait for a sale.
---
My brother reinstalls the game. Ps4 has a shitty system when it comes to updates ive heard
---
Thank you!! It‚Äôs so frustrating doing a quest with multiple objectives and having to go into any kind of building/cave bc you inevitably end up following the wrong marker. Honestly I really liked the new map screen at first but this issue made me miss the pip boy local area map so much
---
The patch might be 1.4g in size but for some reason it requires at least 75g or more of free space to guarantee decompress and install, I‚Äôm down to two games in my ps4 because of the same issue if I install a third large game I always have to delete one to install the stupid Bethesda update.
---
I'll be honest I may have read the camp shields somewhere but i wouldn't be surprised if it came to be here in a few weeks
---
Who is trying to make it sound amazing? All I was saying was that even with low sales there are still enough people playing the game to fill 24-player servers. I didn't say it was the second coming or anything. I wasn't even trying to sell anyone on it. You were the one who decided to jump in with a stat I wasn't even disputing, and then start banging on about a trash storyline and nothing to do.
---
Well I missed out I guess. Should have spent the 200c but I dont care for the outfits. Had no idea the forrest was worth that much.
---
Really ü§î had 110gb free!
---
If they never came back for it, you might as well pick the story that makes you happy, right?
---
You're on PC? I see the same people online all the time if I see him again I'll go grab it if hes got it.
---
The Collectron was featured in the 2018 Prima Game Guide:  [https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76s-dollar5-junk-bot-was-apparently-meant-to-be-in-the-base-game/](https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76s-dollar5-junk-bot-was-apparently-meant-to-be-in-the-base-game/) .  
---
That only explains the Collectron, of course.  I won't cite my sources for the Fridge or Faction camps so feel free to not believe me, but I know for a fact it's the truth :)
---
Indeed, by the sound of it the mayority here didn't play WoW when it launched. Holy shit a bugfest. Still the best game I've ever played.
---
Yep. Double barrels haven't really been viable since the first big nerf many months ago.
---
Oddly, I have two bloodied combat shotguns and only one has the bug -- it appears to do huge damage and picks off massive chunks of health with each shot but the enemy simply regens. I've pretty much learned to ignore it and just hope Enforcer kicks in for gnarly baddies that will take more than two shots to take down.
---
PS4, but thanks!
---
Boooooring.
---
Mmmm... heavily irradiated and severely mutated fish.  For all your daily heavy metal needs.
---
I don't have to repair it mostly. The dr difference is negligible, most comes from mutations.
---
Because they abused it for the double xp. And thus they got farmed by pvpers who were there, which brought out a ton of nerfs to surivial to the point that it just wasnt enjoyable for pvpers. Less caps, more time wasted trying to find the juicy farm builds or just fights in general. Wasted resources.
---
It wasnt worth it to most pvpers, hence why the majority left to go back to adventure mode or left the game entirely.
---
Fo4edit.
---
If they use guns, it's based on the stats of the gun itself and not the npc (unless that npc has a generic 'increase damage' perk).
---
You want to see the damage on each races' Unarmed attack or the damage component of the explosion for AOE attacks.
---
Yall need to turn up the difficulty....
---
The game does tend to have some issues lol so I don‚Äôt doubt you!!
---
Your attention span is short, got it
---
would you like me to draft a harry potter analogy (I could maybe say hogwarts is fo76 and voldemort is its bugs) and  is  or draw similarities between hitler (literally hitler) and fans or bethesda? Would that help you understand the subject more my man?
---
analogy and bold phrasing were a joke my man, and you seem to embrace it too! too bad you can't understand jokes tho, other than that you seem like such a fun person!
---
Sure we can make a Halloween treat basket. It will be only $7 in the atom shop...
---
üòÇ
---
Because Bethesda knows ppl will buy it.  Just wait for a price drop.
---
A fun combo for when you do die is revenant + mysterious savior. Come back with a huge 2 minute damage boost.
---
Unfortunately savior is unreliable even at peak luck.
---
A lot of people prefer the Savage Divide one since the enemies drop more useful junk like acid and adhesive.  I don't see too many people at the Mire one usually.
---
okay troll
---
They released all of the data mined stuff now. So where is your source of this 2 more weeks?
---
Honestly even the timer on the sit down is too short for me, while Im vaccuming up every last piece of junk I still find myself sitting down or drinking still, because spamming e seems to count as holding it down.
---
Its across all 3 system though. Each systems playerbase only needed 200k, thats pretty doable.
---
Gg you got me good! After about a week of the game making me sick must make my attention span short! Why didn't I think of that lol
---
I'd also like to make multiple copies of my legendary weapons with Super Duper too.
---
That's super interesting - what are the perks on the working one versus the perks on the broken one?
---
I‚Äôd rather see some Halloween type missions and some Halloween rewards from said missions rather than a cash grab in the atomic shop.
---
Atom shop. The Raider gear says that it'll be up for 13 more days
---
dude, that's what's wrong with society, mob justice literally isn't justice, that's why proper channels exist, so the system is broken, it's better than mob rule
---
Nice! Getting that blackbird skin! Now just gotta wait for the power armor skin to come back :)
---
Rad storms seem to last all of 90 seconds. Just long enough for you to notice them and maybe think about turning the Storm Chaser perk on.
---
&gt;I've played for about a week. And barely found content.
---
Then you aren't very good at actually exploring...you have to find the content, it's not spoon fed to you like FO4, you have to find the holotapes,  listen to them, find the terminals and notes,  read them. The story and lore in FO76 is way deeper then in FO4, you've just got to actually play it.
---
&gt; I dont believe that having to pay for items whether they be building items or cosmetic makes the game better.
---
Well, what a happy coincidence,  neither do I! Good thing there are more armor, weapons, costumes, power armor and such in the base game than any other Fallout. It's not even close.
---
&gt;the story is lacking, and the lore spits on existing lore. Brotherhood of steel? Not a thing 20 years after the war. 
---
Well now, that's where you are very wrong, but I won't spoil it for you, you'll have to find it on your own...but the lore is very correct, as you'll see, or not, as you choose.  
---
&gt;Well I've gotten up to the point where you gotta go to the top of the world and I still have no idea what the story of 76 is,
---
If you're a week into the game and you're at that point, you're rushing things way too much, slow down and explore the areas. There is no benefit to rushing to the end game, take the time to read and listen to the content 
---
&gt;This game literally made me sick! The FOV and motion blur gives people motion sickness.
---
So go into the setting and adjust it or just turn it off.
---
&gt;Most enemies are glitch out or invisible (given they fixed it somewhat but it still happens)
---
I've been playing since that start and I've never once had an invisible enemy. I have had glitched enemies,  but they die just the same.
---
&gt;every patch they make results in old bugs becoming a thing again.
---
Ummm, no, simply not true.  It has happened and in one case was pretty bad, which was quickly hot patched. 
---
&gt;Now on to the world.
---
So, you go into a bunch of specific locations in Ohio, currently outside the scope of FO76, and why it doesn't match your worldview.  On the other hand a lot of other people that live in W Va seem to think they captured the essence rather well. BTW, the TNT domes are there you just must have missed them in your extensive week of playing. 
---
&gt; Oh and the camp shields that are a thing now? The result of someone nuking Pete Hines base
---
I have no idea exactly what this blather is about, but I can assure you that you most certainly can nuke camps if that's your bag I'd just rather nuke something more profitable to exploit afterwards
---
I was going to recommend a mod, but you're on PS4. Hmm. Fallout 4 MIGHT still have a mod called Touch of Green on PS4...
---
I mean personally I feel like fo76 is still in a horrible pre beta stage and I loved fo3/nv/fo4. The enemies frequently lag out, don‚Äôt take damage, don‚Äôt drop loot. There‚Äôs not much worthwhile to do. It‚Äôs basically playing a really bad version of fo4 online. And I wanted it to succeed, I bought the thing, I played 100+ hours hoping they would get it sorted out.
---
Confirmed "damage refund" healing happening on me as well.  Ended up switching to heavy until it's resolved.
---
My rifleman has the same issue, also in commando. I notice it more if I can confirm that a server has higher lag such as loading times in silos and on terminals.
---
Got ya. Thanks a lot for the help
---
All these suggestions are things from red dead, which did it perfectly. Why not just play that?
---
If the game worked properly yes of course.  If I had a penny for every time an enemy attacks me after I kill it I would be rich...  so I would say yes to DR
---
Im sorry about that.
---
This dude decorates a tree on Dec 24 then throws it away on the 26th
---
The event got pulled around the beta and never returned. 
---
They couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get the 2 sides to aggro properly and I guess have up on it.
---
I stared at one of those forests for ages before I finally gave up and bought the game. My husband got it at launch and I kept telling him Fallout is supposed to be a single player game. Shows what I know, huh?
---
That's where your problem is. It's not praising Bethesda. It's praising that one team. Not the entirety of the company.
---
Just because someone praises one aspect of things, it doesn't mean they're praising the company themselves. In the same way that just because a child wrote obscenities on the picture, it doesn't mean that the punishment should extend to all parties. Merely the parties that caused the problem.
---
So, in that sense? You are wrong. Not for saying Bethesda fucked up. But for expressing that because it's still a Bethesda product? The world designers shouldn't be praised. End of the day? OPs post has nothing to do with Bethesda as a whole in regards to praise. OP is giving that amazing group of designers the praise they deserve.
---
The praise that often gets overlooked on account of the company's fuck ups. Something that is horribly unfair to them as the one team who did a great job. Even those "bugs" of getting under the map isn't their fault. It's an inherent issue in the engine that has been consistently across all the games with that engine even elder scrolls. They did an amazing job with the tools they were given.
---
Just do a search over this channel and you will find a lot of posts that is the end will be exactly this timeline
---
look up some good builds, the current metas are bloodied and tanks, both melee and heavy weapons work with either, one is a low HP glass cannon that deals insane dmg, especially with chems, the other is a high HP tank that can also deal a lot of damage but can take all the hits.  stealth snipers can also be viable since the rifle buff but are still kinda meh, especially when stealth isn't an option
---
Not quite. People are asking for the return of the Blackbird skin for the Power Armor. Granted weapon skins matching with it can be popular too, but not the freaking hunting rifle.
---
I  played a really old civil war game on steam a while back like this. You had muskets, black powder pistols, swords, or bayonets. It was probably some of the best PvP I've ever witnessed.
---
They always have a shell of a time together.
---
Ahhh, I don‚Äôt play it so I didn‚Äôt know they nerfed weapon damage down.. it makes sense in theory but clearly it didn‚Äôt work as intended
---
Ah shit i didnt even think about that. Man i should have waited for the Raider Themed Collectron instead.
---
just read the pop up, if it says door open it, if not don't
---
And the fact that it‚Äôs freaking gorgeous to look at! I love the fall colors and the fun little things you find - like dead corpses and teddy bears. I also build on cliffs so I can see the horizon..so breath taking!
---
I have for a year now. I know what I'm talking about.
---
Did this intending to make a mobile bungalow camp to travel with, but apparently it suffers from the same damn issue as stacking 2x1 stairs.
---
Any suggestions?
---
TNT plant is wv, gallipoli is directly on the opposite side of the river as point pleasant. But instead of there being anything actually there it's just trees. Nothing. If they expanded the river it would feel like an actual barrier, not a stream and the fov and motion blur settings? Care to tell me exactly in setting where it's at? I might actually be able to play the damn game if I'm not constantly getting sick
---
With scout challenges they tried to add stuff similar to wow's professions but they of course lacked depth as with many of fo76's concepts HOWEVER they did roll out a huge new mechanic (alcohol brewing) before and there seems to be a "gold rush" theme going on for Wastelanders, and man game really needs some more stuff to do.
---
I believe they will add something like fishing, enhanced mining, hunting etc some kind of a profession(s) to the game at some point. Game really needs to decide whether its a proper mmo or adventure game.
---
It was kinda jank... But it was our jank. üò©
---
&gt;"an online video game which can be played by a very large number of people simultaneously"  
---
&gt;Some people would say 24 is a large number or even 54 (I think that's their battle royal mode player count)
---
Did you just pretend not to read the "very" part before large?
---
No one considered this an MMO. It doesn't even play like one.
---
Now that's a damn good idea. I can't even begin to tell you how many load screens this would prevent.
---
You must not have played many MMOs then lol
---
&gt;
---
Personally, gonna need those mods and private servers they lied about. 
---
Not sure how they lied about them exactly, as I recall they said would be at least a year down the road, so, ya.
---
All I can say is, your loss, doesn't really bother me whether you play or not but I do like to correct the false and misleading information put out
---
Or... Traveling 25% of the map and finding out your moving towards your buddies marker and not yours.. AHHHHHH
---
Why is my marker the same as my buddies....??????????
---
I mean, it's less buggy as a single player game. I had my doubts, I bought it basically by launch, but hardly played it until the last 3 months and now I have 2 characters ones 120 and ones 30 ish. I want to build near that forest so badly but, it would get nuked to hell
---
Well, my issue with them is that I can‚Äôt take two steps without hitting walls of lag. I‚Äôve never played a MP that has such persistent lag. I do still enjoy the game, however.
---
I've played pretty much every MMO there is starting from around 2004.
---
Rad storms honestly scare me! Lol but they are so pretty to look at. I would love to see them more often.
---
I understand what you are trying to say.. and there are people who worked incredible hard and are probably extremely proud of their work on Fo76 
---
Unfortunately friend that‚Äôs not how the world works... especially the business world.. you can sell something broken and controversial and expect praise for it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You want to adjust your damage to deal exactly 110 damage against a target with a 300-500 DR rating.
---
You don't need flat damage against players if you can get it from utility perks like Concentrated Fire, Gun Fu, Crit Savay or Adrenaline.
---
Tank Killer and Tormentor have great synergy to proc staggering.
---
Right now, Junkies gear (5 active debuffs) will bring you to the damage cap just fine.  It will let you DPS very well in PVE and will even outperform Bloodied if you aren't the best at avoiding damage.
---
For PVP, try to stay at max HP. Keep running Nerd Rage etc. Because that is what will help you stay alive when you are the one getting staggered.
---
If you want to PVP, just find the high-level players and ask them if they want to throw down in a neutral spot. They'll usually accept unless they twinked away their PVP gear or have 2000lbs of scrap on them.
---
Its been around. I'm just stingy with my hard earned atoms. None of what they sell is worth it, so I wait for sales.
---
I played it the week after release, haven't seen it since
---
That would require the game having much cleaner code than it already does.
---
Been hitting Vendors a lot recently and i dont know how people build such big highly decorated camps in Budget. My place is tiny and bare compared to theirs and I'm at budget as is. Some im guessing forgo turrets but having to do all that repairing anytime someone visits my vendors would drive me crazy.
---
Look at the amount of skins for weapons barely anybody uses, there are dozens of then. Then look at the amount of skins for the most popular gun in the game, Handmade, how much do you see? Just one.
---
This new Blackbird skin is no exception, how often do you see level 50+ playerssporting hunting rifles? And how many of them wear PA, let alone with fitting Blackbird skin? I'm yet to see one. Yet here we are.
---
Whoever at Bethesda decided what gun should receive a skin clearly doesn't care about demand.
---
My weird reason for avoiding it is that it's been way too dark the times I've done it. That, and the Mirelurk Queen is such a bullet sponge unless you have a super efficient build and really good weapons (which I don't). The rewards are not worth the ammo investment for me.
---
700 atoms for a single rifle skin? I have two words for that, and one of them is ‚Äòoff.‚Äô
---
Excuse u fucker i am very much a adult
---
It'd be lost on me since I've never read or watched Harry Potter. I was simply pointing out that the complaints against this game are pretty and analogies aren't necessary when you can just say the is below standards. There's also a syndrome that goes along with this sub where nobody is aloud to point out one of the few bright spots in it without people frothing at the mouth about other unrelated shit. This sub is pathetic.
---
Not really. Just take current nuclear winter and change the weapon pool for crates to only include black powder weapons and you're done.
---
But if your gear is all broken you don't get the unyielding sentinel etc bonuses. You might as well not be wearing armor, at least it'd weigh less?
---
It's a bit confusing, but they're placehold till they acually go 'on sale' later.
---
You can seen when and by how much here: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5Kdk3dGN0pdjYQNoHqR78Z/atomic-shop-patch-13-items-and-sales-october-1
---
Combat Helmet light would be nice.
---
No, it's not a competitive advantage. Nor are Repair kits and scrap kits. These are just convenience items.
---
As long as they don't sell actual weaponry, ammo and immortality for Atoms, it isn't a gamebreaking advantage.
---
People can you answer me a question?
---
Does Bethesda take feedback from comments on posts?
---
Oh yeah Project Paradise is a nightmare solo, even between 3 people it can be a pain. The Alpha Sheepsquatch is probably the toughest enemy in the game.
---
Yes! that would be perfect.  Also, why does it seem quicker to fast travel than to use a door to Appalachia in this game..lol
---
Besides what everyone else has mentioned, I'm a shotgunner and Enforcer has saved my ass more than once. Can't punch me if you're crippled.
---
I run with 3 Unyielding pieces, a Bolstering, and a Dense powered chest piece.
---
It has a forced safety system where it keeps the old files until new ones are downloaded. So double the space is needed during updates. Not so good with big downloads.
---
I have the mutation that regenerates 300% health but doesn't seem to kick in right away...
---
Really? So if I have no rifle perks a handmade rifle for me does like 79 damage. So if I understand you correctly if I put on commando maxes out I get like 102 damage per shot approx. But if I'm engaged in PvP my rifle will only be doing 79 damage per shot?
---
ha ha ha..
---
You get all the bonuses, only dr is lost.
---
Stealth mods and legendary effects are active.
---
ah that's nice. been a long time since i played with junkies. would certainly explain the uptick in interest in that build. last time i did it the addictions would go away after some time.
---
so just requires some prep work and don't clear your addictions now that's cool. i don't mind dying occasionally and i'm normally either in stealth or wearing situation specific armor (zealots/troubleshooters/etc) so running bloodied is pretty easy. may have grab one of my other characters and respec to see how junkies goes. i saved a few junkie weapons over time just in case.
---
Doesn't have to be unbalanced teams, just themed. Brotherhood of steel NW where weapons found in the map are laser/plasma/heavies with more PA drops, raider themed with pipe weapons/more melee. Would also really love to see a FFA NW, sometimes team work is great but usually nobody has a mic and nobody is moving in a group, and I end up getting steamrolled 4v1 lol. FFA fits the "overseer" theme better anyways imo
---
Mostly since games are getting larger
---
Same mechanics as monster mash, and I've been to the fort since, never saw it again
---
thanks for the update..
---
There's a blunderbuss in '76?
---
If you had played Fallout 3, you would not need to ask, most of us just call them Yogi's though, it's just quicker to say while running like hell;
---
I've actually was trying pvp out with a bloodied ffr LMG  yesterday. Everyone I went up against wrecked me. Not sure if that's the gun or me. I switched to my anti-armor handmade and was able to kill people with a lot more ease. Not sure what to make of that.
---
You're missing the point, dramatically.
---
Bethesda isn't receiving praise. And no one who sold the product is either. An individual group is receiving praise. One team. Completely unrelated to the problems that arose afterwards.
---
You're obsessed with grouping the team with the company because you're biased against the overall product, when the team is not the company. The team is unfortunate to have been stuck working for the company though. They're as much a victim as the consumer, is not more so because consumers just got shafted on a purchase.
---
That team got shafted on their entire project and are now shit on for being a part of Bethesda just so people can get fake internet points.
---
No one is trying to say Bethesda deserves praise but somehow you seem to think that praising that one team is the same as praising the company. Which makes no sense, whatsoever. Bethesda definitely fucked up. But many of the people who worked on the game still did a amazing work. Case in point, world designers.
---
Or use the resources that were dedicated to a dead game mode to improve the rest of the game ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Sounds right I saw it in a beta play through vid
---
I've only got 2 tendorizer plans and 19 grill master hats.
---
They've also decreased how often legendaries spawn as the boss.
---
I've basically only been playing the Grafton one to farm acid and failed the actual event almost every time.
---
It sounded good but tbh the stretch goals all sucked ass. They just need a twice yearly or so event that channels faschnact (cuz lets be real it's 1000x better than meat week) and doesn't seem so repetitive. 
---
Every 10 minutes kill monsters. Then every hour kill non dangerous monsters. Gets stale.
---
New in the Atomic shop!
---
Plastic pumpkins for 1000 atoms! Available for a limited time!
---
Not to mention that, after hearing Todd say how easy it is for them to make them, I wouldn't be surprised if it was AI making the map.
---
I remember seeing a video about AI making maps for games and it was pretty good. Can't seem to find it tho
---
Yes and I don‚Äôt remember a single post asking for the collectron. 
---
If the pre-release plan info on the fridge and factions is public I can‚Äôt see why you wouldn‚Äôt cite it. I can‚Äôt take hearsay as fact.
---
Idk there was a chameleon one somewhere south in the map that made me nearly need to change my pants
---
Bruh...I was just thinking about that last night when I was raiding the DMV.
---
no!
---
I always do the sheepsquatch for that little bit of ballistic fiber and the horns to make staffs. Last time I did the event I had three over lv 80 people on one animal and myself on another. They somehow let theirs die. It's like people take a stupid pill right before the event. I'm trying g to get the bear arm plans and it's impossible.
---
Bloodied isn't that good in PVP imo, you can hit hard but you can't tank shit
---
And everyone has to wear the civil war clothes?
---
Um...yeah... probably a bit of a trigger for some.
---
Pretty to look at but theres very little lore I care about. Wheres the complex geopolitical groups? I know they can do it because they made the entire elder scrolls world.
---
Get all the backpack mods. You can carry each backpack at 1lb and toggle between them to stack DR or ER to counter your opponents weapon.
---
Maintain food/drink buffs. Drink Company Tea, Hard Lemonade or Corn Soup at all times.  Hot key Tarberry Juice or Sunshine Oil to refresh AP (stackable, can be applied at 100% AP to VATS all day).
---
Carry weight perks do not translate into PVP success unless you are abusing your walking arsenal/fridge. Swap weapons and pop refresh items frequently.  Super Stimpaks are OP.  The D-pad right (can be bound to I for PC) Quick-Heal will use your healing AID in weakest to strongest order.
---
Healing Salve - Diluted Stimpaks - Stimpaks - Super Stimpaks.
---
Healing Salve can restore crippled limbs and DOES NOT force an animation. This is extremely useful for Cavalier sprinter builds.
---
Okay I'm done. My thumb hurts
---
Beyond that, I imagine you would quickly have a bat problem...
---
Yes we need this. Please don't suggest atom shop purchases for mechanics we are desperately lacking.
---
Are you referring to the moldy hamlet? Because I'm pretty sure it isn't the game that is affecting people's health.
---
Did you know you can scrap the power cable to it and it turns off?
---
Har har
---
Over time little paladin.. you will learn which targets to choose first.. and this is maybe the biggest item to avoiding damage.
---
I think I could survive about the same without any armor If I had the same decent weapon at my current level (276)
---
a very good weapon and selecting targets may be the best portion of survival. when it's just too much.. that's when the armor saves our butts!
---
Do you know if tamable cats ever show up? I want an orange tabby so friggen much. I'm mostly concerned he'll die, though.
---
And they have absolutely no way of allowing you to join/queue for that without yet another button on the main menu.
---
PLAY:
---
* Adventure
---
* Survival
---
* Nuclear Winter
---
* Nuclear Winter (civil war)
---
Yeah.. im confused by this also...
---
You should just stop being a pussy bro
---
Right now I've got dodgy, nerd rage, serendipity, tank killer active. 
---
I've been having better engagements since I picked up a anti-armor handmade rifle. 
---
Where I'm struggling is the players with explosive laser rifles. I can never kill someone who has one of those. Is there a working defensive tactic against that?
---
It may have occurred to them early on that if they increase the degradation rate of our food and drink bars, along with the spoilage rate, we‚Äôll ask for a fridge.
---
Broken: 3* Bloodied Hardened Piercing Combat with VATS crit refill and bashing damage
---
Not broken: 3* Bloodied Hardened Combat with 250+ damage resistance while reloading and 10% damage while aiming
---
The only real difference I can think of is the broken one has a suppressor and a stinging mag. It's a great gun, despite the health bar thing.
---
Wrong. It would still bei 3 options like always because there is no survival.
---
Does it at least work as a gas mask?
---
Cam confirm. Start and stay crouched and your good to go. If you stand up during then have to switch your weapon.
---
I'm looking for a junkie bear arm. Wouldn't happen to have one would you?
---
The real penalty is the load times....
---
to me the whole game misses a lot of the things that made earlier titles great. call it nostalgia, i say bullcrap. to me it is just that way. at the beginning fo76 seemed cool, now it's utter garbage, mostly because of the bugs. that also made me not want to play it anymore. but to me truth is, that it misses a lot of the flair and magic fo3 and nv had. also some magic of fo4...although i consider 4 having been poor too already. no diner, no real apocalyptic big city that feels like in earlier titles. fallout 76 world is nice, but dont feel the magic and flair the serial had before. miss too many special places. nice landscape, but lack of truly cool locations.
---
and again. the pathetic amount of bugs and a greedy incompetent developer uber chimp doesnt help either to praise their nice world. no matter if as good or worse than on titles before.
---
I love doing the more one! It's just a quick walk from my camp.
---
Did this fix this crazy bug??
---
B should feel real bad about a multiplayer game where you can't even add a friend!!!!!
---
There's at least three good deposits with water sources near Top of the World, so it's a very frequent CAMP site. A junk pile, an oil seep and an acid site.
---
p2w
---
Motion blur and fov. It isn't adjustable on the consoles
---
Besides perks - Scaly Skin and Grounded are very useful.  If you‚Äôre already running Class Freak for other mutations these two are a no brainer.  I tend to avoid energy weapons on Bloodied so all is well.
---
Appalachia is amazing, no doubt about that.
---
My complaint timeline, as an actual PVP player is closer to this:
---
My stealth build doesn't appreciate being marked on the map after a single kill.
---
My stealth build doesn't appreciate thousand cap bounties after a single kill.
---
People are now offloading all their caps onto mules.
---
People are now exploiting fast travel protection.
---
People are no longer worth the rewards for killing them.
---
My stealth build which relies on damage multipliers to be good now has all damage multipliers removed. And now everyone uses critical bugged auto railway rifles.
---
So, you got the last one right in my personal experience.
---
You should just stop being an asshole bro
---
I could see it being free in the atom shop. Thats what they did with the punch bowl. Different styles of jack o lanterns will probably cost atoms but i can see a freebie
---
Still no Nuka Cola fridge?  More time to save up for it I guess.
---
Dude I know....I accidentally walked right into a nuked fissure area with no power armor on. I kept instant respawning inside it, swarmed by scortched and scortched beasts, and had absolutely zero health so I could not even have time to open inventory or put on armor because to many rads. It was instadeath for about 10 times until I gave up and hard quit the game to server jump.
---
Tbh think it's a great timing to remove survival. Have no idea what platform you are on but hackers are a real problem on PC
---
I reported the Chally bug here, before the update, but it probably went unnoticed. Its not a big deal for characters like the collectatron or Chally, but for Grahm is another story. Switched Servers, and they were fine. Dunno what causes this.
---
I put mine in a small room with a garage door, behind them another small room that is locked with a switch that powers the garage door and machines.  I have a wall with shuttered windows in between so I can stock then from my secures room.
---
Well shit...you can drop/gift that? I know you cant vendor sell it. For now on I am going to start doing that with the extra chasis units I find. I will drop them with 100 percent fussion cores outside vault 76
---
Oh my god yes. Maybe split the community so the mode it takes away from server population. Yes, sounds great.
---
well no actually once I opened up a thread, and I believe it was one of my very first threads, about how good Austin was with derelict cities as they feel like there have been people living in them for quite some time after the war with all the tents and barriers and stuff (especially morgantown and harpers ferry and some raider roadblocks). Thread got really cozy because I didn't say stupid stuff like OP such as "why is everyone mean to devs:((((" "f76 is good in some areas can we pretend its not bad in some :(((" 
---
praising one aspect of this game doesn't require bashing others for pointing out its shortcomings, coz voila, both parties are right! Game has cool and lackluster parts! And I don't even want to talk about technical side of things.
---
thus I mocked him with his **awful and disrespectful** way to make **sure** his **opinions** get through our thick skulls **:((((((**
---
That's what we thought about the fridge. I hope you're right, but it just seems like they'd rather not put in effort (which would be very little as both the models and functionality already exist) unless they can profit from it. That makes me very sad.
---
I have personally built 9 levels high as the max. Some people have told me about C.A.M.P.s that are as high as 12 levels, but I haven't seen any myself. My personal belief is that you can build 4 levels high, 4 levels low, and 1 level in the middle. 
---
There is a theory that since the build area is essentially shaped like a bubble, you can build 2 smaller levels in the middle of the bubble. 1 high, and 1 low. But I haven't been able to substantiate the theory.
---
If you can't move your peppered plan, let me know - I finally got a Tenderizer and a Salty mod, but I wouldn't mind having the other two just in case.
---
I like the idea.
---
The only stuff I really have to put in is raw meat, but hey, it's meat week after all. Wash it down with some nukashine from the punch bowl and you're good to go.
---
I've been stealing from poor Chally's tub when the event is over since it's pretty fast getting water from it.  He kind of just stares at me in disbelief.
---
Thats it, sometimes you dont have enough time to open map and fast travel
---
*couldn't
---
Yes but that's isnt what I'm talking about. I'm talking about what they release next week hopefully wont be more raider gear.
---
Hell id love for them to ad violant storms (Huricane's) (Tornado's) (Flash flood's) (Mud Slide's) just to name a few.
---
That first paragraph already establishes how biased you are.
---

---
You ever play Point Lookout?
---
this!
---
it's like, "hey, the car is total shit and be happy it even drives...but look how nice it is" lol...although to me the world isn't even close to the magical worlds of the previous titles, a game that is broken as fuck like fo76 is, no beautiful world can make a game better, when it's not even functional and feels like a bug itself, rather than a game.
---
dont worry for the downvotes. the sheep only do what sheep do. they need a shepard to follow, rather than have an own opinion and call out facts and truth.
---
As an owner of just about every Minigun, I can confirm Bloodied under 50% health blows the AAE out of the water.  My bloodied isnt Explosive, my AA is, and my bloodied deals by far more damage.   Over 50% they AAE starts to catch up.  Over 70% health the AAE wins.
---
Hi, just confirming this is a visual issue that we're aware of and working on. When this happens, logging out and back in should cause  the Collections tab in the Pip-Boy to update and display the correct amounts.
---
The free items were 2 icons? No camp items? :/
---
couldnt disagree more.
---
This is a really good idea. I keep the reactor room locked anyways so it would work out well for my build already. Thanks!

---
yes i have tamed a cat before but those things have literally 1 hp so if you aren't somewhere completely safe they will die
---
I think the fridge is different though. The fridge is monetized because it provides benefit to you, the punch bowl and this pumpkin idea really only benefits others. I think bethesda doesn't really care to monetize those kinds of things.

If you dont use it, or dont plan to ever us it then no not dumb, but you can only get another from a player or make a new character.

I'm almost Level 50 and I truly love this game and map. It is almost relaxing (if I'm not fighting off things.) Yes, it has bugs but I'm sticking with it...I'd like to see the map grow.

Best  
---
Fucking  
---
Game
---
It's definitely worth it. Very pretty.
---
I occasionally see it in a player‚Äôs vendor. 
---
You could also level an alt character and use a trusted friend to transfer it to your main character.
---
You have to totally break combat for Healing Factor to kick in. When crouched it cannot say Caution.
---
In PvP however, healing factor kicks in whenever you break line of sight.
---
It's a crap weapon, no loss.
---
Ahh, I remember it like it was yesterday. I'll never forget when Rockstar invented fishing.
---
Thanks for the info. It's unfortunate that they die so easily, but at least now I finally know whether the lone one I found awhile ago near the Overseers camp is tamable or not.
---
The game is driving me nuts. The setting, the story, the events, etc. are all really fun, but it seems like every time I try to play the game I run into some fun-ruining bug. Like the other day I decided to do The Messenger. Followed that robot around for a bit until we came across a Behemoth and were attacked by mutants at the same time. I kept one mutant alive to keep the Mr. Handy from leaving without me, and took down the Behemoth. Turned around to take out the mutant and then I couldn't find the Behemoth's body to loot. Looked around and apparently he his corpse disappeared and he had completely respawned. Frustrating, but whatever. Run back to Mr. Handy...and he's stuck in the ground. Spent a few minutes trying to smack him out of the ground or let the game catchup...but nope.
---
You have demonstrated to us that you have no idea what an MMO.  is. A game that is an MMO  such as WoW, ESO, and EVE Online, is hardly even comparable to a 76. 76 lacks the secondary charities that MMOs have such as but not limited to professions, skill lines, character abilities, and Races(not eve). Instead, Fallout 76 is a Hybrid Muilpayer shooter-RPG. Much in the same vein as destiny or   
---
 the division. However, Placing the player in an open world where the player must construct a camp or take refuge in a previous built/pre-placed crafting area to progress the gameplay through crafting and upgrading weapons. like a survival game. the "hub world" in 76 is the player's camp. In which the player can return to at any point. Fallout 76 is not an MMO.
---
I have a vampires ss +1s grognaks axe i got off a ghoul a while ago. Is that better?
---
You are pretty gullible if you still think it‚Äôs coming in a month. Probably the biggest issue with 76 is that people are too gullible after all that has happened.
---
PvP damage cap of 110. Your bloodied build is only effective to the point where that baby puts out 110 damage, beyond that you are just handicapping your own health pool.
---
You can get a better legendary one
---
Usually. It's basically a whatever slot for what you want or need. The fifth unyeilding isn't necessary unless I really want more agility, but then I don't find it necessary, so I have a filler that's more or less for secondary and tertiary perks than primary until I can find that perfect piece.
---
Correct. Which is why you will encounter people with a mixed arsenal of gamma guns, handmades, railways, and 50 cals.
---
Maybe it will make a come back with wastelanders with npc?
---
Powerplants are the worst!
---
There are more powerful sledgendaries that can outperform the All Rise. It wasn't a bad thing to get rid of it unless you were a collector, but like others have mentioned, you could possibly find another in vending.
---
This is the one he‚Äôs talking about https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Battle_that_Never_Was_(Versus)
---
It already exists https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Battle_that_Never_Was_(Versus)

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Battle_that_Never_Was_(Versus)
---
Actually not all, theres a few more raider bits to come and I would imagine that'll either be next week or the week after, theres a white bloodied skull gas mask coming still.
---
Its not nothing like an mmo my man, it is closer to division yes but it division is further away from wow than f76 is.
---
Yeah we could, but no one would play it.
---
There was a point earlier this year I couldn't even play the game.  Any action that required zoning frequently kicked me from the server, and with some quests getting kicked from the server sends you to an earlier check point.
---
I was stuck on the DMV quest for months because I couldn't do the multiple zoning steps in the quest without at least once. It's better, but I still consistently have issues - one of the biggest has been zoning into an area and the mobs just not even being present.
---
Before I got my handmade, I was using a lvl40 bloodied explosive assault rifle; it worked out just fine. Just need those correct perks for it.
---
$14 on a single paint, lmao, this is so pathetic. bethesda is truly scumbags and easily replaced EA as the scum of the gaming industry. not only as EA's game are at least playable\^\^ but after there were single paints for $18 already, while the game is not even justified being called a beta, not surprised by these scammers anymore ,)
---
As far as I know just the bleedout syringer works haven‚Äôt tried any other weapons
---
Probably should've kept PVP and Workshops the way they were. Cause it worked perfectly fine. Instead of nerfing everything to the point where it's literally more griefy.
---
It‚Äôs better but I‚Äôve liked it since beta and haven‚Äôt minded the couple bugs that were there in the beginning and now there are hardly any. Definitely nothing game breaking. But again, I thought the people who complained back then had different expectations and maybe this game isn‚Äôt right for some people.
---
We'll see
---
Sacrifice to the real gods
---
Exactly what I thought... makes for a good laugh though
---
You can't equip broken armor. Which means you're not wearing it, and don't get the stats.
---
Cool thanks!
---
Search for one with swing speed.
---
There's also the grognak axe and the pole hook. Both are excellent 2 hand melee options
---
Price things right and they sell.
---
Marsupial alone saves my little fluffy ass.
---
&gt;You are pretty gullible if you still think it‚Äôs coming in a month.
---
I do believe there will be a major drop on the one year anniversary...with some hot patches within a couple days of that. The good news is we'll know real soon and somehow I doubt you'll be back to admit you were wrong at that time.
---
Yeah I did, it was my favorite FO3 DLC. Reminded me more of the Mire. Ah well people see differently
---
Yikes! I never knew that.. Thanks for the info, I always thought if the machines were off they were off....
---
I put my vendors behind the garage doors.
---
When I wanna sell, doors are open.
---
When closed .. there's no way you're getting in.
---
Got my wires set up so when I cut power to the door, the vending machines turn off too.
---
Fallout was inspired by this
---
Armor doesn't unequip when it breaks. Everything works, you get the stats.
---
&gt;Does it have flaws? Yup,lots of them, just like most titles out there
---
I dare you to find 3 more AAA games with the size of F76's problems. Even NMS didn't have this many bugs and stuff man, they just lied lol.
---
My fear is that Wastelanders will end up being micro as well and that it will end up being a few people plopped into a few under-used houses somewhere, with about 3 or 4 quests tied in.
---
What we really need, are full on factions that MATTER. The ability to earn favor with various groups and then be safe/welcome in their territories, and not be safe/welcome in territories controlled by groups we aren't in.
---
And we as players need to determine what those territories are by virtue of capturing public workshops and instead of marking them as private, mark them as 'part of my faction'
---
If that happens, then this game has a very long life ahead of it.
---
It could notify you, then you could make the decision whether to sell or not. If its an expensive weapon or piece of armor that would take you just over the 30k limit *or* the profit you could make from it is large enough, then you may want to sell in that case.
---
If you could have a menu accessible from the start screen (similar to the way challenges are accessed) then you could set it to SELL, DONT SELL, and NOTIFY ME. Make the default option DONT SELL as its the safest one.
---
But for now, I'd settle for turning the machine off which then makes it inaccessible to anyone but the owner. That's the simplest thing to do.
---
as much i'd want to love this game, it's a broken insulting piece of shit. still...
---
All Rise is a really nice starter 2H, but you'll have a lot of opportunities to get much better weapons so I wouldn't sweat it. Check player vendors, gamble with the Purv, or go kill super muties.
---
Download and play it. The only one that knows if you will enjoy it is you.
---
They stated a while back that they are removing survival to focus more on fixes to the main game/ to prepare for the wastelander's dlc.
---
They didn't invent it but all this hunting survival wilderness stuff is the core gameplay and done beautifully.
---
the way of the dodo
---
Instigating and Anti-Armor I can confirm stop working.
---
In The Vault stated they were discontinuing Survival starting today.
---
I agree 100%
---
I also love the fact that i can build my camp where I want. Currently sits on a small island in the river.
---
Also like in fallout 4 It seems like places tell stories. Whenever I see skeletons positioned in a certain way (bottle in hand etc.) I remind myself that the atomic explosions froze them in time. Bethesda did a good job building in those little stories. Makes me more inclined to not just loot quick and repetitive but look at the details.
---
And that gives the game a chill pacing.
---
You could argue that the Ash Heap is reminiscent of New Vegas's Divide, as well
---
But still his original point is how good the world is. And I do agree that Bethesda outdid themselves with the variety, environmental storytelling, lore, the amount of interactive elements and just recreating West Virginia in an impressive way. That other games have functional MP-worlds with less bugs than FO76 is a different discussion. Personally I would never swap Fallout for one of the games you mentioned, even if I've encountered a fair number of (minor) bugs. 
---
I've now, despite being very sceptic to the game at first, played 76 more than FO3 and New Vegas. I can't explain why it's so good, but I do think the fantastic game world is a big part of the reason for the it-factor, as I found FO4 to be quite bland and boring. Some games seem to be much better (read: more fun) than the sum of its parts, and for me 76 falls into that catagory.
---
No, they monetized it because it was a feature they knew people wanted (since the community suggested it and kept asking for it), and they care to monetize things they think people want, since that's how they can make money.

Btw, you literally just argued that they made it atom shop only to intentionally make it P2W, and that unless it's P2W (giving the player an advantage in game, even if it is small) they don't want to monetize them. I don't think that's the case, though it's clear they are inching closer and closer to outright P2W items by gradually increasing the amount of benefit the items give the player, but they clearly aren't limiting themselves *just* to P2W items.
---
Son... I have some news...
---
Yep. I'm seriously praying for something with wastelanders that isnt just 3-4 quest per faction. If it is I'm probably gonna run them then stop playing. This game needs some seriously in depth content for end game an continual play.
---
I think Beth forgot how to code players into factions
---
Yeah I was testing out an IE Shotgun last night and had this happen. Hopefully it's fixed soon.
---
Way too slow and only works outside of combat
---
I see posts like this and camp help but think "why would you keep repairing your brahmin and letting them repeatedly destroy it?" It cost 1 razorgrain and 1 steel to fix. Get over it, really.
---
Thats already out, the underarmor
---
I sent you a request if you want to get a raid party going.
---
&gt;1) the game world is broken and immersion breaking
---
I'm unaware of any game breaking, (unable to continue the game) bugs right now, can you enlighten me? 
---
Immersion is completely subjective so we can agree to disagree on that point. 
---
&gt;2) there are other games that do Fo76s job well better..
---
Again, completely subjective,  however I'd suggest you go play them then and not get yourself all worked up on a game you don't like,  life is short!
---
&gt;works to full basically full functionality, 
---
What doesn't work to full basic full functionality?
---
Ah shit, you're right. That sucks I'm tired of raiders stuff. I like the junk decor concept but 40 versions of the same tires is lame. Really need some love for Responders an maybe more for free states an definitely brother hood.
---
I haven't got anything for killing JennyE or EnterNewGame and indisputably this content is harder than V94 :)
---
Don't aim for objecjectivity if you're not ready to fight everyone else's fights.
---
Gone and lost forever
---
Now this is good fucking content
---
Omg it was so bad! Imagine shooting a  deathclaw and doing about 6-10 dmg per shot with a handmade. A little more if you were bloodied. It was a giant suckfest and that's when everyone left back in August. It was so bad it seems intentional. No way anyone over there thought it made combat more fun.
---
It still procs when you visit sometimes, but it still doesn't work. Last time I tried it, I joined the Union but the Confederates were marked as friendly and I couldn't damage them even as they shot me, and the Unions were the opposite.
---
You make it seem like the world of 76 is a masterpiece. While I agree that it is a very visually appealing world, it has absolutely no substance. And no, by substance, I don't mean lore, I mean a strong narrative to the world. With the elimination of human npcs and by the nature of the game being an online game, you know that every location will hold nothing truly unique or game-changing. I've played the game to death and visited every single location, including unmarked and inaccessbile ones, and the only things you find are cool visuals and ineresting terminal entries/recordings that add nothing to the table (except in a few rare cases). No interesting npcs or truly unique enemies (other than the mythical creatures that you barely encounter), no game-changing gear, no meaningful decisions, no special mechanics, nothing. This is one of the biggest aspects that makes elder scrolls and fallout games special and it lack severely in this game. This is why the world of 76 is the worst overall imo and I won't thank them for the sub-par work done just because they wanted to rush the game out. Some of the locations they had could have been incredibly special but they fail to reach their true potential, just like everything else in the game.
---
I agree that 76 is unique with its offering among similar games but that doesnt necessarily mean a good thing. I'd rather play a game that does one thing very well than one that tries (and fails) to do everything.
---
I love doing the mire one when anyone's camp is nearby. Being overencumbered post event and crawling through the mire is not fun. The one by pleasant valley station is more of a guarantee though since it is within crawling distance from a scrapping station, vendor and stash box.
---
Running works well
---
Can still buy from them if they find your camp
---
Can still buy from them.
---
It was around since launch. Patch 5 or 6 made it "harder" to trigger but it was still 100% consistent for certain builds with certain weapons. Patch 12 brought it back to launch levels. Good to know the game is still unplayable though :(
---
I got the game last nov. But l I've been on for a few months now and at a lvl 46 but I'm about to get on back on track.i assume you've completed your tadpole quests huh.
---
Nailed it.
---
Having many months long history of fighting some players, I've been given a chance to test various tactic against cooperating strangler PA guy. Having many months long story of dominating in PvP, I consider my judgement really well founded. When I say the shit is top notch stuff that obsoletes previous items, it is so.
---
Well, survival... Its just wasn't working, he tried and give it his all but we had to let him go... Maybe one day we will get a new one, but today we... We.. Mourn.
---
Why cripple enemies if you can 1-hit them?
---
It won‚Äôt interfere with harvesting at all, thankfully. But, if you put something decorative under the crops (like a bathtub or planter) and decide to move it later, you may end up with a dickens of a time trying to ‚Äúget through‚Äù to it‚Äîthe crops have a large aura of ‚Äúinteractivity‚Äù that can mask everything around them.
---
But if we have to pay $7 for each different fridge color you want.. you KNOW that's the only way it would ever be implemented.... then they'd slowly release 7 different colored versions of the transfer station.. not 7 skin mods for the fridge you ALREADY HAVE...! üòì
---
You misspelled fixing.
---
Thank you for your service
---
Surely this is a joke
---
exactly, it's just..  3 weeks at least i keep waiting, of all the possible themes, raider is exactly the one i'm not interested, waiting for some power armor paints that are not mono colored hopefully.
---
Why would you need to mine coal?
---
I never let hackers stop me from loving survival mode, but yeah they were really annoying.
---
Nah, don't come back. The game isn't for you.
---
I did the same thing because I'm never gonna use it and I'm not a collector
---
Yao Guai is pronounced "Those Asshole Bears"
---
I'd like the weather to have an impact, too. I want to slip on rocks, I want the wind to mess up my sniper shots. I want the deafening sound of rain to drown out a stalking deathclaw.
---
Same here!
---
Im already on hiatus until it hits. I consider wastelanders to be my last attempt to find a game here.
---
Survival Mode was phased out with this last maintenance. It's dead and gone.
---
No one ever uses mine, haven‚Äôt had to craft nukashine in months
---
Yah but its pretty worthless and its a handgun doesnt drop legendary
---
Orange tires for Halloween?
---
I just refilled mine. Maybe if you move it closer to your vendors you'll have more luck?
---
Maybe we could have some sort of leaderboard. Maybe if we get enough points players can try to hunt us!
---
Ohhhhh ! üò±üò± I've been scrapping the wire and bee bopping along! I had no idea you could still shop!
---
Nothing much else to do but explore and murder stuff after a while lol
---
You are talking to somebody who runs around with a full group all wearing the armor, steam rolling and spawn trapping low levels at events while trash talking non stop with what sounds like the voice of a 15 year old. 
---
Pretty sure you aren't going to find common ground in this discussion.
---
Don't think I even started. I jumped off a watch tower a week or two ago for someone's tadpole, though. :) I have finished... exactly nothing. By the time I started playing, people were complaining about the lack of end game, so I was afraid to finish anything. What platform do you play on?
---
Lol fair enough but still. At least it‚Äôs with someone
---
I have heard people joke about this but have never seen a case of people becoming violently ill from it. Preahpes speak with a health care professional. it could be a sign of something serious. trying to help here.
---
I use the armor plated back pack mod all the time. I don't tend to carry much on me at a time unless I'm farming resources at which point I wear excavator power armor for the carryweight boost. 
---
I'm wondering what I should have my S.P.E.C.I.A.L's at? I have 20 level ups I can use to switch those around if needed.
---
Don't peaceful players want aggressive players separated from them? They were begging for it until survival mode came out!
---
It just couldn‚Äôt.....survive
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4ZKOaWgcjj9ShSaduDeyI7/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-september-updates
---
Oh....the branding iron too...haven't gotten that either
---
There's a golden version of the guns and skull logo too
---
Yep..all it does is take the vendor icon off the map
---
&gt;just cause you have not encountered them doesn‚Äôt mean other players haven‚Äôt..
---
So, the opposite is also true, just because you've had a bad time it doesn't mean that everyone has...I, for instance,  have never had a game breaking bug where you can't continue.  I also rarely have disconnects or performance problems, but then again I have an awesome internet connection and a high end rig to play it on. Not everyone does, I get that, but I do. Your mileage may vary.
---
Trust me, I've been killed A LOT.
---
I managed to rack up about 30 hours in FO76 before I got bored and put it away, probably never to be played again - but we'll see if/when mod support comes out.
---
Fact is that people have different tastes, and to people like me it's just not exciting. The slap system ruins open PvP, the capture points can be fun but a disconnect means you lose all the supplies you dumped into getting it set up, and the quests are just *not* as good as an NPC that you get to know throughout multiple stages to create a deep story.
---
I put hundreds of hours into FO4 and FO3, and I still to this day occasionally spin up FO4 in VR. I'm definitely a fan of Fallout. 76 is not the same thing as the single player experience (nor should it be) and the multiplayer experience it aims to provide is sub-par compared to other games in the genre that offer more dynamic experiences - even if they lack the polish.
---
The game is a survival game about looting that lacks the threat of other players and consequences for death. If that's your thing then good for you, but for some of us it's just not fun.
---
I'm excited for 3 months from now when we get red striped glowstick tires with glitter.
---
Covered in blood, no less. Some of us prefer things to be clean, and nice. If I can make a gun out of a couple hammers, a toy car, and a beer bottle, why can I not use Abraxo to clean the blood off the fridge? Hard pass.
---
I enjoy meat week. a full week of it probably won't hold the attention spans of most of the players so maybe 3-4 days would have been sufficient. I finally hit the Tenderizer and while I was excited about it, I scrambled to make room for it in my stash. Holy Dead Weight, Batman. I've got the salt and pepper tenderizer plans learned so I'll probably help those who wish to mod theirs and enjoy a little tato salad while I wait for someone to buy my Tenderizer.
---
In a few weeks there will be orange ones probably.
---
My build isn't really a bloody build. I was just using a bloody lmg because of the fire rate. Didn't seem to be very effective in pvp
---
On the shitpile where it belonged.
---
Lul I guess.
---
Log in and decide for yourself.
---
Yeah probably.
---
&gt;try venturing out there and you will find fully functioning games that work how fallout 76 is supposed to..
---
Perhaps you too should venture out and move on with your life...it's not healthy to be obsessed about a relationship you're not even in
---
Three Dog was provided with pronunciation diacritics. He is the resident expert. DEFER TO THREE DAAAWWG! OWWWWOOOOOOO!
---
Reee! I don't like so one else Should. Reee!
---
Wow ,the designs,er re-skins get lazier and lazier.
---
How do you fridge and tire folks feel about paying FULL PRICE again for a new color skin?
---
Greedy Bethesda ,just greedy.....
---
200lb global account wide mailbox in lieu of a standard stash increase would be great...
---
As much as I loved survival, you‚Äôre absolutely correct.
---
You left out the most important part!
---
Don't feed the yao guai... your own corpse. Run, you fools!
---
I wouldn't think so? Just don't shoot back. Done
---
Really? What language, if you don't mind my asking?
---
I don't imagine there's a lot of fish left in most places... Between irradiated oceans and mutated creatures like Mirelurks, a lot of them probably went extinct...
---
Because the quality of the paper only matters until you scoop your dog's shit with it.
---
Have you watched a single Juicehead video in the past 2 months? He literally makes a video on new issues that rise up every other week man.
---
As far as the merch goes, Bethesda makes games not merch,and that's what happens when you sub out to third parties and don't babysit them every step of the way or do quality control,you get low quality. As far as the game goes I think it's quite awesome. Its a place to congregate,share, even form new friendships with other players. Sure it's frustrating when you  get to a part that took you awhile to walk to because your storage space is limited but you have all these cool guns you can't get rid of only to be disconneced from the server but it's still way better than the crap you deal with on csgo etc. Like anything out there though you're always going to have your haters.
---
Me too. Bc after meat week and clearing my 2000 script when sale drops. I‚Äôm playing something else.
---
Lol I thought you finishing at first glance and I was going to totally agreed with you.
---
Were you wearing power armor? If not then you can't use stabilized for the anti armor, and lmg is big guns.
---
Looks Welsh! But according to all of the Fallout 3/NV/4 NPCs, you're both absolutely correct.
---
Sounds more like an event
---
Too bad you can't turn them in for atoms. Bethesda can sell them to you, why can't you sell them back?
---
Here it is... [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dbx9x1/response\_to\_floating\_camps\_post/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dbx9x1/response_to_floating_camps_post/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Well, new content requires Devs to get paid.  Since the atom shop is currently paying the devs, it makes sense they work on that first.
---
Really? I had a double barrel I adored that worked like a charm, but replaced it with a combat shotty with 4x ammo capacity because I couldn't handle any more of this reloading after two shots nonsense. I have more problems with the combat shotgun than I EVER had with the double barrel, as far as regenerating enemies go.
---
The great xp farm in the sky
---
This is great!!
---
Same here. But it only happens with the combat shotgun. \*well, I'm confused\*
---
These days I've been seeing those drops from Collision course collect in a pile. Last two times I was through there, there were a stack of 5, then a stack of 3 crates from that event. I went up and looted them without having even been a part of the event. easy cloth.
---
Xbox. As far as the endgame goes, I don't plan on there being an end game, well at least not anytime soon. I did the tadpole challenge so I can craft my mr. Pebbles backpack. I mostly wander,loot and shoot stuff . At some point though I will be looking to get with some people and destroy crap together...ahhh good times
---
No. Dont like them dont read them.
---
Let's use this thread to talk about Halloween
---
Whenever I stress out playing other games, I drop by Appalachia and take a walk, it relaxes me immediately
---
Attatched Jet packs to both arms for the giggles. Yeah, that's two cores gone now. Wasn't a good idea.
---
Yup
---
I mean ... It's just now October and in my local grocery store they have Xmas stuff out. Just the nature of the money hungry beast lol.
---
The best part about this game is the map. Every location is so unique, and it‚Äôs just so fun to travel around the game world.
---
We're so sorry Survival Mode
---
I started playing in January - a lot has happened since then.  Stash weight increase, pacifist mode, new events....So ya, its better in a lot of ways.
---
L21 is still a grindy part of the game, but you are not far from levels where your life will become much easier.
---
Its different than the old iterations.  But its still Fallout.  It still has issues.  Yes, some bugs are annoying, but there's nothing that's completely broken the game or made it unplayable. (IMHO, YMMV, and all those disclaimers).
---
I'll have to borrow a buddy and test it. Will report the results back here if I can.
---
I don't but it's hard to avoid them when they're every other fucking post.
---
There are ways around that FYI. But I agree survival was dying
---
Hey big ups to you for no more floating camp. My most recent one is here https://youtu.be/-vfrblbWJjk
---
If you wana check out a few more you can check my post history.
---
If you stick to low levels (as the other person said) you might just get someone desperate enough to take your word for it. They know they can pick up another identical level 5 pipe pistol of the next scorched they kill, but might have a really hard time finding screws!
---
Or join me on the dark side and drop 'em. Mine came with an atom bundle and I didn't want them on principle.
---
I know that's right!!
---
I think he‚Äôs confusing Halloween with Christmas
---
I love October because Halloween an my birthday!
---
Going off of that logic, we should get a lumberyard map with only axes, hatchets, and wood armor. I would be so down for any of these.
---
I horde every kind of meat and plant I find and cook it at home, regardless of whether I'm gonna use it or not. I really only eat dog food, soda and stimpaks now that I'm a regenerating meta-human, so it's even more ridiculous now than it was a fewweeks ago. Food makes up 60% of my carry weight - I turned off thru hiker for one second, and my carry weight went from 280 to 440.
---
I just really like food, digital or not.
---
Impossible .... this is one of those pay to win mechanics.  Where someone who paid atoms for these are automatically winning over you and your mountain of repairs kits you earned in game.
---
Point Lookout is closer to The Mire, in looks, at least.
---
this thread could be SPOOKTACULAR
---
LMG is tricky to use in pvp even with proper PA Stabilized HW build - it is basically cqc weapon (where it properly shreds), but it won't do you any good from medium range; only maybe with Formula P.
---
Well that stinks. I'm on PC. I still don't have a backpack. When I am over my weight limit, I'm so far over that there's really not much anyone or anything can do about it. *shrugs* I play the same way. Oh, and rebuild my camp every other time I sit down with the game. ;)
---
Raider again? &lt;sigh&gt;
---
Guess I sit on my caps until that Nuka Cherry set drops.
---
That blows. I've luckily not had that issue with shotguns in quite a while. The ranged damage bug is really fun while you're doing the vault raid with no melee weapons.
---
Fuck survival.  Glad it's gone.
---
https://youtu.be/wxhWgddekC0
---
OR! Just bring back the junk walls from FO4. I would be happy with that, too...
---
you-ey gooey, because why not.
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
two weeklong holiday events (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say Survival mode or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but I am cautious
---
Surpressors is a better option than Nocturnal. 
---
Surpressors will actually help you during the fight.  
---
I concur with the rest of the sentiment on Nocturnals, its garbage.
---
Right lol. I mean they are super helpful..but ive never bought one. It does free up stash in a sense because i dont have to save mats for repairs..but..theres 40 pounds pf em hangin around now.
---
Imo, 3 ranks of incisor is better than 3 ranks of slugger past the first and blocker is better than barbarian on a melee build.  
---
So I'd change str to something like this [https://i.imgur.com/DplToFj.png](https://i.imgur.com/DplToFj.png)   
---
Beyond that looks fine, I personally prefer at least 3 perception so I can slot in lock pick for silo runs and vault 94 but if you don't care about those don't worry about it.
---
MEAT WEEK is fine as it is.. the real hook is primal cuts not the cookout
---
&gt; People are now offloading all their caps onto mules.
---
This one bothered me the most. People didn't even want to risk one of the most plentiful resources in the game even before player vendors.
---
Getting zero caps for each kill while they keep respawning on a friend and rushing me just sapped the fun out of Survival for me.
---
Right, so I love this. She looks fabulous!
---
wait, the mining helmet color can be changed?!  i've only ever been able to add "bright"
---
There is not, really, afaik; maybe on a absolutely defense-oriented build with a stack of stimpaks to proc on multiple stages.
---
I would fill mine with Single Action Revolver Ivory Grip plans
---
Man that is incredible! I would like to see a server filled with nothing but custom camps like this!
---
It's over, Suzanne.
---
New Vegas Divide is like that.
---
You're confusing "game world" and "game mechanics". The FO76 world IS beautiful, but our enjoyment there-of is hampered by bugs and glitches, the "physics" of the world.
---
Exactly.  We're a gaming community, not a money hungry corporation. It's bad enough that the stores push that crap 3 months early,can't see why gamers are doing it now.
---
Yeah, we need to stop posting about Halloween already.  Its time to put up the lights and stockings.   Bring on the Fat Man in red.  (I hope we get a fatman skin for christmas)
---
Nope. Game sucks
---
This right here.
---
My nurse outfit can go on over raider armor, but a hazmat is too skinny, apparently.
---
The fuck like.
---
Because the bad shines more than the good.
---
What resources where they dedicating to survival?
---
At first I was afraid...
---
BOOOOOO.... Halloween is awesome bud.  If they dont have some representation of the big ween, theyre missin out.  I bet you watch the grinch at christmas and root for the greasy green bastard too.
---
That's been a known glitch for some time now.  No news that I have seen as of yet as to when it will be addressed by Bethesda.
---
I personally pronounce it, "OMG I HATE YOU!!  JUST DIE! SHIT!  STAGGERED AGAIN!  FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!"
---
It was an un-used mode that near the end didnt have  more than 1 or 2 servers up to support the few people (less than 50) that still played it. 
---
So they got rid of it to work on the game modes people actually play.
---
No worries though, survival greifers will be back to Adventure mode today to make our lives hell.
---
I remember in fallout 3 and 4 when you'd change you HUD color, your pipboy light would change too. That was the first thing I tried to do when I booted up Fo76, didn't happen :(
---
The server space it was taking up? The updates needed to balance or change it at all.  Etc..
---
This sounds like the Simpsons...
---
oh ok thank you for the reply :)
---
I give you an upvote because (a) it's a good idea and (b) your name is literally bar, and that makes me happy.
---
I was thinking about blinky when i wrote it.
---
Good for you dude. Awesome camp
---
nope. have been trying to get a decent fixer myself. already been through a few k in scrip with nothing great.
---
I love it dude. You‚Äôve done a great job
---
It's not seriously ill. Its like motion sickness like on a rocking boat or in a car driving down the highway. The motion blur being on messes with people eyes and it get them sick trying to make sense of it (not a medical professional)
---
&gt;to focus more on fixes to the main game
---
That thing I cling to whole being disconnected five times in Fort Defiance after dying five times to the rare and illusive (let's play a game called "spot the sarcasm") floor ghouls.
---
Honestly, the raider-2 set is the worst yet on the shop.
---
How lazy can you get? :/
---
I'm not trying to be an ass, but how would it be pay to win to be able to move things between characters? People do it anyway. It would just be less of a pain in the ass. I don't understand what you mean.
---
Just dump it in a suitcase and hold your breath like we had to do in the olden days. Talk about pure adrenaline..drop a be handmade in that bad boy and log off. Tell me your b hole doesnt pucker.  Or find a buddy. But i still visit my secret suitcase every once in a while. I usually just put a few beers in there. Dont really need tp use it anymore. But..its a small part pf my history withthis game and i love that little green bastard.
---
Are you sure your not thinking of Camden Park or that water park?
---
You're right, Halloween requests are over, time for Christmas! /s
---
Yeah, I put it in my machine to sell. I'm having success with a AA handmade.
---
Bubbles are spherical. So you think the build area is spherical? In my limited experience it seems cylindrical. I'm not picturing your middle of the bubble theory.
---
You say in the video that your camp is inaccessible except by fast travel. Did any non-player, non flying enemies ever attack that camp?
---
I'm building a camp that another player could reach only with difficulty. I'm hoping that the creature AI isn't smart enough to be able to attack my camp. It's only been a few days so I don't know if I've succeeded yet.
---
Yes but the 100+ money drop is only during that event...if I remember right.
---
Does the damage boost only work with teammates? I was thinking of equipping for SBQ 95 3* to boost everyone‚Äôs damage against her. It would be short work of her if it stacked.
---
YES!! They do this and I am all over it like white on rice. It would be the same display, turned 90 degrees. OR let me rotate it (and any wall decor) myself. Paintings on strange angles in a haunted house, anyone? And those vertical displays.
---
Oh, Survival mode, where you gone run to?
---
I never said it is an MMO I said it looks and feels like a poorly made MMO
---
As a collector, i kept mine.  I no longer use it having found a bloodied bone club fss 90% that replaced it.
---
It doesnt weight too much so it keeps my Somerset Special company in my stash.
---
It stomped some dumbass to death.  Yeah.
---
Pacifist builds spend all their time on Reddit bitching about surivial mode not being the same as FO4 hardcore mode.
---
They would go into survival once a week and get killed once then come on here and write essays on how unfair it is. And Bethesda just listened to the Pacifists and ignored everyone who played survival. 
---
Survival was my favorite game of all time. It was Fallout but with a real tension and fear. I had to constantly listen for footsteps and look for dots on the radar. It was awesome.
---
Good source of iron, potassium, and all the vitamin U(ranium) you can handle! (and possibly more)
---
Sweet jesus yes! That's what I would love to see
---
Fasnacht was fun once. They did have a better loot pool with super rare things but the events were ez at lvl 5.
---
Meat week best week!
---
You must be new to this sub.
---
I like it! It's funny because on the flip side of it, I can see the appeal of a floating camp, and have been thinking about stilts.
---
Yes, thats exactly what I said, how woke of you.
---
Same with neon lettering...can't make my kame house with straight lettering üòï
---
 side note: outside paint needed also

PSA: The display sets from left to right top to bottom and back to front.
---
The shelves from top down hold 6 7 7
---
The seventh of the last two shelves will be in front of 6. So if you put S.P.E.C.I.A.L. In that order L - Luck will be in front. Alternatively if you want S - Strength in front you put P.E.C.I.A.L Bobbleheads first and Strength last of 7.
---
Yeah that would be great.
---
And that, of course, wasn't at ALL the fault of said dumbass, I'm sure. :S
---
I'm making a DnD 5e campaign based off of 76 map/creatures/basic story. But magic=radiation. Played a 1 shot in the mire and players liked it. I feel like it could be a good 1-20 campaign ending with fighting the scorchbeast queen.
---
Christmas than! 
---
I scroll past all sorts of things that bug me like all the BETHESEDA WAAAAAMMMMBULLLANNCE is screwing up so bad. or the is this a good time to rejoin the game? or the list GOES on you can't stop it. You are just sitting and adding your own BS to the subreddit that is Fallout 76.
---
Do you FLIP out when Stores JAM christmas, halloween, valentines day, killing turkey day, all over their store? music, posters, products? same sorta thing it's just going to fucking happen! keep scrolling or walk past it in the store or tune it out like your kids.
---
And a revolutionary sword! Melee would actually be viable if people took several seconds to reload between shots and couldn't vats headshot people.
---
I noticed since last meat week I‚Äôve gone from about level 50 to 100.  The events are much easier now.  I remember I couldn‚Äôt put down the damage numbers to defeat any of the big creatures from prime cuts.
---
Not really advice, but during the grind between 50-100 you work on perks, getting your build dialed in, maximizing damage, etc. and you slowly accumulate legendary weapons, most of which are junk but it only takes one or two and suddenly things are better.
---
So use this time before wastelanders to grind out those levels and perfect your build and maybe get ‚Äúone good gun.‚Äù
---
Post like this bother me more than Halloween posts. I wish people would stop making these stupid fucken posts.
---
Thanks! Yeah that would be great if they could make it so people could build little towns together.
---
So... you call the community "sad" for not agreeing with you? (Also, that seems to imply you see yourself as not part of the community- then why comment here?)
---
And you explored every nook and cranny in FO76 in a week? Really now?
---
Lmao!
---
It does
---
Blow me.
---
Noted, thanks boss
---
I bought the tire wall 2 days ago! I should have waited.
---
Only if you dress up in a Halloween costume.
---
What platform are you on? I rarely run into invisible enemies anymore. Lol and I was just legit running through there yesterday, and didn't have any problems with any enemies in there. (I'm on xbox)
---
Lol btw, Farkas is also my boyfriend's husband too. ;P
---
This. In PvP you want to basically overpowerered dmg in shortest time possible; hence FFR weapons with all the dmg perks possible. And a smart play.
---
I believe tonight i am going to join you fellow dweller..  I've only done floating (but usually over rivers/streams, with entrances on both sides...).  but seeing so many great dwelling out there, I'm going to go hunting tonight for some plans I haven't bought yet, then make a real home.
---
Yeah seems like whatever color you go with your pip boy light matches the color slightly
---
When people use insults rather than discussion I count that as sad. You're putting words in my mouth that I did not say myself. I said I played about a week and from what I experienced it was empty and boring. I never said I explored the whole map lol
---
And good gun is totally relative, I find. I have a wonderful friend who plays a stealth build. Every time he picks up a good shotgun, he seems to pass it off. We had a debate between two because we thought was the "best" gun was different.
---
Any response you get is going to be pure speculation. It's not like Bethesda is going to be transparent about their plans. 
---
In their defense, it's not easy to be transparent when you just make it up as you go.
---
What technology are you talking about? Open world?
---
OP isn't about a technology. Nobody else creates such detailed and interesting worlds that Bethesda does.
---
Grow up and learn to take criticism.
---
Liberal,say nothing 'go along to get along' attitudes like yours are what's killing this country.  Grow a backbone already. 
---
Say nothing and nothing and nothing changes. Say something and things change sometimes.
---
Nice! Can‚Äôt wait to see it, hopefully we can start a movement here!
---
&gt;Dont buy the scrap collector bot or the weapons in the store. Dont reward scummy practices.
---
Nothing scummy about it...they are not selling weapons that's a complete fabrication.  The tiny slasher knife is a part of the costume, not a usable weapon, you could even damage a radroach before it killed you! The other "weapon" is nothing other than a reskin of the combat knife, the same one everyone can make upon leaving the vault, it does nothing advantageous.  The bot get 15 pieces of scrap an hour, less than an excavator anyone can make, and it's mostly useless concrete and glass. It does have some comic value however. Also, anyone can save their atoms, they dont have to purchase them, and get the bot. 
---
You tell me anything that is P2W in the store. There no loot boxes, usable weapons,  armor or aid items. Don't cheapen your argument by throwing out crap that isn't real, keep it real
---
Yeah, themed, smaller variants of NW would be pretty neat. Just a few teams of 4 and limit them to smaller areas like inside the Whitesprings, within watoga, etc. Then just see to it the drops are limited to a certain pool. One could be a revolutionary war set with the black powder weapons and some melee weapons, another could be energy weapons for brotherhood or enclave themes.
---
For the record, I liked your title. Catchy af!
---
Fear not, for now Bethesda has gained like, two more developers to save our game from the dozen or so bugs still haunting us. 
---
I hope they fix fast travel first
---
Not even. Check profile.
---
Wouldn't surprise me.
---
I keep mine on a switch that turns them off to stop advertising, and closes them off with a garage door to completely prevent access. When I want to turn on the map advertisement and open them back up, I just flip the switch. If you‚Äôre on PC I can give you a walk around of how I did it. Just reply here if you want my IGN
---
Well, if you pull out the sheepsquatch costume to wear for Halloween, you might be able to find it!
---
God i hope so. Survival was what lead me to buy the game. I knew that slap damage would be a nightmare.
---
I want action! I want to scrap and build my weapons of war! Stalk players running in for quick trips to known legendary spots or daily atoms.
---
I miss it alreadyüò©
---
I typically play on a full team when I'm playing  in a team at all. If I had a cap for every time I've had to double check my map to make sure I'm headed toward my map marker and not someone else's, I could buy so many legacy weapons.
---
My weapon swapping glitch is that it usually doesn't matter what the previous weapon was, it always swaps to Perfect Storm!
---
Fuck yeah I do! Who doesn't love an underdog,green or not?!!
---
I was petrified
---
The game is basically a bunch of cool ideas put together in a giant mess that will take years to repair. The fact that there is 24-32 players in a server is meaningless when everyone is doing their own thing. Player vending is good though. If only we had more CAMP budget to be able to build what we want...
---
It might be.  Don't hold your breath, the last PVP game mode lasted about 2 months before it started dying due to non-use.
---
I'm still trying to get the spicy mod plan then I'll be happy.
---
Like yo Momma.
---
I can do that.  How about the Oscar-Meyer WienerMobile? ü§£üòÇüòéüòò
---
because JH is the only youtuber out there /s
---
1 example that doesn't fit the norm, congratulations  *slow clap*
---
I hope so. I have friends who bought the game to play survival and they all quited today.
---
No new plushies or Dogmeat/Mr. Pebbles/Mr. Fuzzy items? Ugh that's the only stuff I'd actually spend real life money on. The last plushie (vault boy) was kind of ugly so he doesn't fit into my collection well.
---
I‚Äôd agree with the 1-2 server comment.  I could server hop a lot and never changed survival servers.
---
The comments here make it seem like there were tons of ppl in this mode.
---
I‚Äôm super sorry man. I really hope people take your post seriously and only put up stuff you want to see from now on. Stay strong.
---
XBox. And I discovered Fort Defiance yesterday with a friend and then went to bed. Today it's continually disconnecting me and I've got ghouls on the ground, kicking me with their feet while they sleep wa- uh... sleep slither. Lol. Farkas is great.
---
Nah, I wear it for pajamas.  Its not scary enough for halloween.  Now if I could find a Megasloth costume.  that would be epic.
---
" Fallout 76s community is just as sad as the game lol. "
---
Soooo.... you DIDN'T say that JUST above my reply? Did a magical spirit type it instead?
---
And you judge the world "empty and boring", yet haven't explored the whole thing? It would be like visiting Manitoba (in Canada), then declaring "Canada is so empty and boring" without exploring the whole country. And West Virginia is just ONE state...
---
Your parents should've chlorinated the gene pool....
---
I have an extra tenderizer, do you have an extra spicy mod?
---
The mire still scares me
---
Me too, I missed it after patch 11
---
Because it's not on PC and I'm not about to debase myself with a console.
---
I whole-heartedly agree. The FO76 world is amazing. It's the reason I fell in love with the game and keep on playing. With that said, some new content would be nice.
---
When you want to love the game you'll always try to find ways to dispute those that disagree
---
You said none.
---
&gt; The people who play it are trying to justify the 60+ dollars they spent on it
---
Lol...well, I've got &gt; 1200 hours in, I think that is more than justification enough for a $60 payout, literally pennies per hour playing, I can live with that return on my money!
---
It's not a mistake and don't call me Shirley.
---
I gave away my 2* handmade to get a 1* furious lever action, because it suited my needs better. A random weapon from the purveyor or as loot can change everything.
---
So next store I walk in to JUST LOSE my shit? Shit will change and I wont go to jail? Is this the bridge I die on? It's a forum for people to talk about the GAME they clearly love or tolerate. They also CLEARLY like Halloween. SO why do things have to change because of one FATHER that clearly hates halloween and thinks IT's JUST for kids?
---
I have said my piece a few times IT HASN'T DONE A THING. So oh FATHER OF WISEONE tell me how it goes when NOTHING FUCKING CHANGES!
---
Just Saying. You sit behind you screen and think you are making a difference then on a FORUM for fans or things.
---
&gt;Nobody else creates such detailed and interesting worlds that Bethesda does.
---
Lmao
---
Well I'm at work for another hour, but after that, if you need any help with anything, feel free to hit me up with a DM. I'm at level 160 and don't have much going on other than selling my wares. üëçüëç Have a good one!
---
And that's good an well. Like I've said a few posts up I'm glad people can find entertainment in this game. I just cant
---
  Sounds almost like you want the event to be something predictable that you might be able to solo, (Same critters spawning in the same place, so after a few runs, you knew exactly what would appear when, with the delay between stages allowed you to effectively place yourself) instead of requiring a number of people to do different  things simultaneously in order to be successful., in that 4 tasks are static locations (drums/spits/woodpile/greens), but 3 are random location and quantity (critters, poo, and fire)
---
  Considering where the BBQ is held, the relative simplicity (albeit with chicken with its head cut off frantic activity) and almost every time legendary armor drop is good, especially for lower level players.
---
There's still a lot to experience and I would hope it is more stable since then. Personally I'd say worth it (I started playing around March and had a good experience)
---
Yes but there was a base backpack in the game there is not a said version of the fridge.
---
I save anything good I get, even if it isn't for my build. Yes I have a mule. Since the start of last meat week I have leveled up two characters from 1 to 100+ while my main has gone up maybe 10 levels and secondary has gone up maybe 3 levels. 
---
Just doing the new grinds alone has netted me more good gear than I ever got while playing one character. Not sure the reasoning, maybe just dumb luck. Stop trying and just play the game, eventually the RNG goods will choose to bless you. 
---
PS: Trading and shopping at player vendors doesn't hurt.
---
The world is beautiful, but my game crashes to desktop every time i play.
---
What type of player versus player do you want?
---
You have squad based in NW where people all start on a level playing field more or less.  I wouldn‚Äôt mind a solo-only mode.
---
You have workshop PvP where you can gank unsuspecting people who aren‚Äôt fully paying attention.
---
As broken as Survival was, I‚Äôm just trying to understand what people got out of it that isn‚Äôt in the game already?  Sense of danger?  Bonus xp?
---
My guess is that we‚Äôll see specific PvP events and/or dailies once Wastelanders arrives. They have to know how unpopular open PvP has been with the majority of the player base, so I doubt we‚Äôll see that, unless there‚Äôs a new iteration of Survival or a new implementation in private servers.
---
This is a great idea. Let's get some severe weather.
---
I was testing it a bit and was swapping between a .50 cal machine gun and a gatling plasma and after a few times my .50 cal un-equiped so i had my fists out then i went to re-equip and it pulled out my LMG.
---
Press expand when you open the wheel...
---
Good luck, we're all counting on you.
---
If that's what you like to do and that's your thing, go for it. It's all about our personal experiences and what we want to get out of the game. The tadpole backpack will give you +29 lbs cause the BP itself weighs one. It's not bad if you really want to get one you just have to complete any three challenges I believe.

&gt; Survival is over for now
---
Workshops are the temporary replacement for survival till it comes back.
---
I'm on PC, so I just bought a 1$ account and launch it in a second window. Makes the whole process much faster and easier. Plus you can move your caps this way.
---
Basically 3 servers maybe 4. That is all on AWS and doesn't take man hours to handle. 
---
There were three updates. Three in the entire time it was live. And they were just changes to who is on the leader board. I know nobody spent more then an hour before they did the final need to kill the survival mode.
---
All I'm saying is this idea that there were resources being used on survival mode is bullshit. They ignored it since June. So any resources they were using on survival haven't been spent on survival since before summer.
---
Okay you got a point there. I still don't get the complaint though. People are upset that the first fridge was generic and so wish that these were skins they could spend even more atoms on?
---
I thought this was the case the first time I went there. It turned out to be a bunch of robots that didn‚Äôt even spawn properly. What a disappointment...
---
Looking at your build might reveal issues that you could adjust to make your character more durable and/or powerful.  
---
I'd recommend posting your current build using this site:  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)   
---
But generally speaking if you are a melee character in PA I'd suggest testing out dodgy + kinetic dynamo chest mod to improve your durability.  Imo the STR stat for a good 2 handed setup should look something like this:  [https://i.imgur.com/DplToFj.png](https://i.imgur.com/DplToFj.png)   
---
Getting good items is a long term project.  Check player vendors, and farm a lot of scrip to roll a lot of weapons.
---
Maybe a plastic pumpkin equip item and you can go to people's camps and trick or treat with a placed camp item?
---
So it's ok for you to vent but not me,huh?
---
I KNEW you were a Libtard , lol. That's their EXACT mentality. 
---
As for ' sitting behind a screen I'm happy to come out from behind it and meet anytime. 
---
You wouldn't say shit to my face but 'yes sir' you little runt. LMAO!
---
Now go ahead ,call me an e-thug ,internet tough gu ,w/e but those are FACTS!!
---
Yeah, posted some up on Twitter :) https://twitter.com/curtandis/status/1179107204571500545
---
It‚Äôs the same it‚Äôs just on sale
---
Why not just make a new mode. Slap on TDM/DM and base on the old unreal tournament/timesplitters modes?
---
Treat it just like NW with stripped down characters and give em a pipe pistol and a dream. 
---
Do just like those games did and have weapons,armour and aid items scattered around the maps and kill, loot your self/team to victory. 
---
Raise the stakes by making players ante up 5-10% of their junk amount. And kills award X amount and deaths the same way. 
---
Walk out with twice as much as you walked in with. Great. Don‚Äôt well adept, learn, overcome.
---
Nah I'm talking about the "new" red ones
---
I think you need to step away from the internet for a while bud.
---
I love threads where the OP makes a post people enjoy, then completely shits the bed in comments. This is what is good on Reddit.
---
The most fun ive had on the game is in survival PvP battles at my camp. But that was a long time ago
---
Okay cause you‚Äôre a programmer at Bethesda right? üòâ there may have been 3 main updates for survival but there have been many smaller ones too. There was more than 3 servers as well. But even if there were only 3 servers of survival, why keep a whole game mode up for 40 people?
---
Don‚Äôt be discouraged.  I didn‚Äôt get my first good weapon until about level 80-100.  Further to this, when I was level 180 or so I would trade with people twice my level and my gear was better than theirs, go figure.
---
Figured it would be fitting seeing as we get a new set of tires every week for the last month..
---
I‚Äôm good. Numbers don‚Äôt mean anything on the internet. 
---
If a few posts of the same topic bother you. Maybe this place isn‚Äôt for you. 
---
Seeing the same thing being pitched is a good thing. It means people are thinking alike and want growth.
---
You can quickly fast travel out to before the rads hit, at least on xbox (unless you get that really amazing bug where it just kicks you out of the map view without fast traveling, and you have to try it 5 more times...then it's a RIP for sure)
---
This is sure an informative post. Thanks for the in depth analysis of what you think is wrong and the positive feedback for how to handle it
---
There are gangs of raiders and cannibals roaming the map?
---
Yes but it‚Äôs a pain. Gotta put it on carpets to put it inside lol
---
The tokens are used for something, you turn them in at the terminal outside the mine for the lode bearing event. Kinda like the candy for monster mash. They award prizes based on how many you have.
---
I just made my first floating one last night lol. In my defense ,it's on my ALT who only level 30, and I'll probably.move my camp 4-5 more times before I settle on a place, so I wanted it to be quick and easy to my for the time being. I'm not a fan of the floating camps at all, but right now it has a purpose. Now mains camp is built into the side of a cliff and I took every precaution I could to make it look good and not float. My end goal for the new character is a bunker type of camp, I'm working on stockpiling concrete and plans right now.
---
I honestly wouldn't have a problem with that at all. Like you said it fills an aesthetic purpose with this version. But what if you wanna change to something else. This way there id a baseline with room for improvement.
---
I thought removing the rug removed everything on top of it?
---
Yea i just steal my sons xbox after they go to bed lol. Two accounts is so much easier. But initially..yea the suitcase flip was the most intense aspect od the game lol
---
Survival goodness: The post-apocalyptic world felt post-apocalyptic. 
---
It didn't feel littered with friendlies dotting every part of the map which could be instantly traveled to without any hindrance or obstacle other than the ever present fast travel bug. It wasn't loaded with people who wanted to "help" you, whether you wanted their help or not. 
---
It was a mode where I could say, "GET OFF MY LAND" and either kill or be killed for it.
---
So long and thanks for all the fish
---
So sad that it should come to thisüëã
---
Nothing like reeling in a big one while scorched pistol whip you from behind,that seems very familiar, oh wait they do it all the time when I'm crafting or at a terminal, etc
---
Yes
---
Sometimes working, but is not a fix.
---
I've seen some really creative floating camps, and I've never knocked anyone for having one. Myself, tho, I prefer builds that fit more neatly into the lore I come up with for my characters. My main lives in a "free states outpost" he discovered and renovated out in the swamp. My medic char operates a bar and doctor's office under the big bridge by Flatwood. I have a third char but I never really established a good identity for her. She's my NW character so I guess her head canon is up in the air.
---
Good to know thanks for the info
---
How do I install a garage door that only I can operate?
---
My biggest issue is invisible turrets.  I had turrets on top of the bungalow.  I logged off and when I came back you can see the wires connecting to where they should be but floating in mid air.  The only way for me to get the turrets back is to store the bungalow, which I really don't want to do because of how finicky it was to place things inside it.
---
Thamks for the offer but I'm ps4.
---
On the other hand, I‚Äôve respawnn far from where I died in the blast zone, and by the time I rejoined the battle with the queen, she‚Äôs already dead and all the hits I got on her I lost because I died, then I got nothing.  Such a waste of effort.
---
Put a computer outside, lock that. You can trigger switches from outside.
---
Do they ever do Brotherhood themed skins &amp; things.? 
---
I don't want to dress up as a raider they are a bunch of thuggy tea leaves
---
I just pitched this as a comment. 
---
New mode: TDM/DM. Everyone is stripped down to a vault suit and a pipe pistol. Scatter armour and weapons around the various lots for maps, kill your/teams way to top of the match board. 
---
Ante up scrap as reward. Kill to earn more of your foes scrap and death loses some scrap. 
---
A fallout twist on the old unreal tournament gameplay.
---
Nah, you don‚Äôt really need that scarecrow. Just put more delicious corn.
---
In FO4 oh man the storms would scare the hell out of you man it was great.  I would run for cover in a hurry.
---
Life Giver, Nerd Rage and Iron Clad. Makes you tanky even without Armor. If you happen to get scout/marine its very hard to die. 
---
Winning NW takes a lot of patience and just smart game sense. If your shooting every target you come across your only making it harder on yourself revealing your position with noise. 
---
My loadout is this:
---
1. Life Giver
---
2. Iron Clad
---
3. Nerd Rage 
---
4. Frog Legs
---
5. Marathoner 
---
6. Action Girl
---
7. Bloody Mess 
---
I personally really enjoy being able to run around alot with Marathoner and Action Girl. These perks could be swapped for Tank Killer and Master Commando.
---
Exactly what I was thinking while simultaneously laughing my ass off at the visual of this moron standing there stubbornly repairing at those two guys merc'd it everytime he did! 
---
I bet they were PISSING themselves laughing!!!!

And than they just spawn inside the building without even opening the door. Some clever ones can figure out elevators too.
---
What I mean is that the world works quite well with the detail, the amount of players, crafting, base building, enterable buildings, the public events, the nukes and scorchbeast etc all in ONE world for the most part. It's not perfect by any means but no other game comes close to cramming that much content and activities in one world like the games in my OP.
---
I have yet to receive one and I've been a part of around 20 maxed out cookouts.
---
I‚Äôd really like to take a peek at your cliff camp... drop some pics if you have any.
---
Side note, the moldy helmets were not from the Bethesda Power Armor Edition but from a Nuka Cola themed power helmet released by Chronicle which as far as i know isn‚Äôt part of Bethesda.
---
The tenderizer weapon can be used with any build. Probably not worth moving points just for that weapon.
---
Dumbest shit ever.
---
Wow, dude. Thanks for totally not unnecessary insults and showing me your point of view through a reasonable response.
---
My only gripe with Atomic shop is it should take in consideration if you have already purchased items outside a bundle.  It should subtract something from the total price.
---
The fact is vent or not rant or not people have beliefs call me whatever you want but doesn't change the fact people can like things why must we conform to your wants or likes. Are you a Christian that slams your fucking God down everyone's throats as well? Your way or no way?
---
And ya I would meet anytime or a fucking beer and rant with I like being a devuls advocate. There is always 2 sides to every story it brings some really great conversations.
---
But the fact is holidays are coming and you cant change that, Bethesda's going to fuck things and people are going to bitch I can't change that. So here I am playing with your rant.
---
Truth though I hate that people decorate so fucking early for holidays but there is no way even with HOA to change that. People will be people as long as no one gets hurt. Talking about Halloween hurts your eyes obviously.
---
No greenhouse?  That's the only thing I really wanted in the few months I've played, but I didn't have the Atoms to buy the whole bundle you had to buy to get it when it was available.
---
I'm max scrip anyway and they always fail, don't bother now and I've got too many Flag plans, hats, outfits, tenderisers and cleavers to bother with the cookout either. I prefer doing other things.
---
If you're on xbox. I'll be home and online in about 45 minutes, if you need a mule for your hat.
---
I start following them all over the map when they do that asking for them to be my friends.  
---
Eventually they're running away as fast and quickly as possible.
---
Just be friendly. :)
---
There's another settlement that needs our help..
---
It's funny. There is a level 3 locked trailer in Gorge Junkyard. Inside is a full set (not sure if it's guaranteed full) of Level 15 Raider Power Armor. Ironically, you can't get master lockpick til level 40. So either you need someone to pick the lock for you, or maybe it's meant to be teammates sharing lockpick together to get it open. Either way, great GIFTING opportunity for those inclined to such things. #raiderclaus.
---
Nice try, Preston.  This settlement is just fine without you.
---
I bet you're even from California or Washington state , lol.
---
They probably did ... around Boston
---
XB1
---
&gt;How do you fridge and tire folks feel about paying FULL PRICE again for a new color skin?
---
Remember when we warned them about this and they insisted we were being over dramatic? Pepperidge Farm remembers.
---
Also, after seeing this and then loading into the game only to crash every five minutes inside Fort Defiance while dying to ghouls sliding around on the ground, then leaving to go elsewhere hopefully more stable and still continuing to crash, I'm officially done spending money in the Atom Shop. 
---
I had originally planned to buy every specialty ten dollar pack, whether I liked the included outfit or not and whether the shop itself had anything I wanted or not, and then buy other packs when the Atom Shop has an item in it I really want but need a few more atoms for. After today, I'm done. 
---
These people can not stand there and say "we need you to spend money in the Atomic Shop so we have the money needed to make the game more stable," and then crash my game five times within a half an hour on a game that's been out around a year now. There's no longer any excuses they can give me to part me from my money. 
---
I had planned on getting another copy of FO76 so my husband and zi can play together instead of sharing a disc and playing seperately. I won't be doing that now. I've also lost any interest in buying future games from them, and this is coming from someone who, even after the Fallout pre-order fiasco, was still interested in pre-ordering Elder Scrolls 6.

When they got rid of the Atom Shop standees, I thought they genuinely valued the players experience over how much money they make OR that they at least realized that happy players spend more money than pissed off players. Then they pulled the protectron and fridge stunt, people got angry, people offered a compromise of "make the fridge and protectron free and charge atoms for the skins," and Bethesda turned around and handed us full price skins while continuing to have the originals be items you can acquire either by not having other responsibilities outside of playing Fallout or by spending real world cash.
---
So hopefully I can earn the atoms I need to unlock the power armor station skin before it's vaulted, because I originally had plans to purchase some atoms today, but have since changed my mind.
---
If I wanted a relationship with someone who spends all my money and then screws me over in return, I'd go back to my ex. At least when I play EA's Sims 4, my game is stable.
---
&gt; Why doesn't Bethesda get more credit for the world they've created?
---
Mostly because it's overshadowed by the giant shitstorm they brought on themselves.
---
Yes vinyl bags. It's not smart to slap your most dedicated and highly paying customers in the face before the game even begins.
---
Rampant and easy duplication glitches and other bugs reported in BETA, not fixed for months.
---
General shittiness, t-post, texture issues, invisible walls, lag, stutter.
---
Perk card system is the suck and there are only a few viable builds.
---
Energy weapons still suck because Bethesda won't acknowledge the problem with how their damage works in this game.
---
The "economy" is completely broken.
---
I could go on but the point is all this completely over-shadows all the world building that was clearly done by a team of very creative people.
---
Try looking on Lfg...always a few posts for vault raids.
---
yay my bday is saturday and I love halloween :D
---
That's bullshit. My butt is starting to burn even more now.
---
I guess i'ma quit of this crappy game, again. 
---
Ofc I'll check how Wastelanders will look like when it'll be released, but not sure that it will bring me back.
---
Sick.
---
Wow what the fuck? Seriously? What harm was it doing just existing? To much work for them to maintain? So now we had a game mode taken away?
---
Will keep that in mind. Thank you.
---
I wish we could see the sun more. It feels like it‚Äôs always cloudy and it‚Äôs boring waiting for sunny weather to take pictures
---
I had 3 three star glowing ones attack me at the same time last week in White Springs during a nuke.  First time for me there but definitely more likely than Grafton Steel.
---
Damn so I guess it‚Äôs pretty rare.. have any idea how much one would sell for? Also thx for your comment c:
---
What's the point of locking your CAMP? People can't mess with it unless you are in PVP with them.
---
I just discovered that when I'm on my speakers the bug is gone but when on headphones it's back... Maybe it's something to do with my headset?
---
That's a pretty hard thing to be skeptical about lol. But it's in the datamines. However some backpacks datamined STILL aren't in game
---
Here's the [Inside the Vault](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4ZKOaWgcjj9ShSaduDeyI7/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-september-updates) article where they explained it.
---
It may make an appearance after Wastelanders?
---
The open PvP made the world super tense. Most times I would play survival mode exactly how I'd be playing adventure mode but now I'd also have the threat of hunters. So you are exploring, questing or just farming but eventually you end up marked on the map. Now you prepare yourself for a battle, Maybe I won't win, but each time I'd try new things to either lure them into a trap or make sure I'm positioned well and chemmed up. It was always a gamble but sometimes I'd kill them first and it was so fun. 
---
Yeah it was hard, some players come at you hard and don't hold back, but I was still having fun even when I was getting my ass kicked.
---
Beth makes games not helmets. That was the failure of a subcontactor, furthermore probably one beholden to gamestop not Bethesda. 
---
If your bobblehead's head falls off, that's not Bethesda. 
---
Now the bags, well that too was probably a supplier fuck up, but that should have passed through beths hands and so thats on them, the rsst of the merch is LICENSED and someone else made it. 
---
We now return you to the well deserved world admiration already in progress.
---
Doesn't really matter what I say here, you'll not believe it or get it. The fact is I've simply not had one game breaking bug. I've had a few, mostly, visual glitches. There hasn't been anything stopped me from doing a quest or exploring. I hardly get any DCs as I've got super fast and reliable connectivity and a high end PC rig.
---
No no no not in the atom shop fucking stop giving them pay to win ideas !!!!
---
Looks prerty good but can i suggest throwing down a couple rugs to break up the floor colour a bit
---
Aggressive friendliness, I like it! If this happens again, I know what I'm doing.
---
Well it might be just you then because it literally works for me and everyone I know that plays the game
---
Come prepared with scrap wood and challys feed.
---
 When the event starts add wood to the wood pile then give chally some feed and start collecting all the greens you can.  
---
While you are gathering up the greens extinguish any fires you see and clean up any waste piles.
---
Halfway through gathering all the greens run back to the wood pile and add wood then give chally some more feed.
---
Keep extinguishing any fires in cleaning up any piles you see
---
Once you have gathered all the greens run back and add more wood to the wood pile and give chally some more feed.
---
 Now it's time to start killing critters as fast as you can. All the while continuing to add wood to the wood pile and challys feed.
---
 The wood pile and Challys feed are on timers so you have to kind of know when to run back and add some more.
---
 Once you feel you have gathered enough meat from the critters go drop all the critter meat and greens off at the  Drop off bins.
---
 Very important to turn in everything in at once in bulk.
---
 A side note is I never do the primal events so I never have any prime meat to turn in but I'm sure that would help as well.
---
 Hope that made sense and helps.
---
No shit? Well TIL.... seeing how I am lvl 80 and hovering around 800-1200 caps at any given time its not an issue for me, but certainly gunna keep that in mind. Thanks!
---
&gt;As for aesthetic items, there are more weapons, weapon mods, armors and mods, power armor types and mods, under armors and outer wear(costumes) than any other fallout. It's not even close. That's just what's available playing the game
---
You're comparing an on-going live-service game that's been consistently updated with new content to single-player games. Of course it has more cosmetics, it would be completely unacceptable if it *didn't*. 
---
Compare it to its actual competition - other live service games and, arguably, even MMOs - and it falls way short on the cosmetics front. Nevermind how basic and generic some of the paywalled stuff actually is.
---
Sounds good, I can give you a tenderizer for helping out.
---
It's been like this for a few updates now, iirc. They upped the chance of legendaries in the wild basically. No need to constantly farm whitesprings or certain events. Sometimes my normal run will have 5 legendaries, 3 within the same area, some days it will have none.
---
So 500 caps to the next person to go to a mandarin restaurant  and order yao guai ...and go
---
Because it's just a sandbox filled with old fallout assets. They didn't create a world. The players are the ones making the content.
---
It doesn't weight much does it? I guess it's not dumb if you need that 1.8 lbs or whatever it is in your stash... Coulda sold it for 200 caps or something lol
---
Whitesprings is fun right, even after the smoke clears and the dust settles after the nuke it still gives u irradiated ghouls and plants. I think there are more legendaries at one time in whitesprings than anywhere else on the map, one at the cottages, one in maintenance and 2 in golf club. Crazy fun and an ammo drain need to be a melee build lol thanks
---
Branch out and play some more games man.
---
I replied elsewhere saying exactly this, but after today, I'm done purchasing atoms. I used to purchase atoms under the mindset of "making the game stable isn't free." Then I get on today and crash every five minutes, regardless of where I am, all while dying multiple times to ghouls asleep on the ground. I'm done. If something I want from the Atom Shop is vaulted before I've been able to spend enough time in game to crank out the atoms, that's just too bad. Maybe it'll come back. Maybe it won't. Either way, it's not a life or death situation, so I'll survive just fine.
---
The solider, not the curator...
---
I know,right?
---
I fired up the game half an hour ago FT'd to Ash Heap for Primal Cuts,killed one super mutant ,started firing on another and game froze and crashed. 
---
I actually said out loud 'fuck this game, I'll go watch Netflix or surf Reddit'.
---
I'm just fed the fuck up.
---
No
---
Because everything is tied together, would you really give credit/praise hitler for one of his paintings in-spite of what else he has done?
---
u/Ladydevann any chance the greenhouse domes will come back soon? I missed them the first time :/
---
Thanks for the shotgun shells the other night
---
I can help you out later tonight if you want. I'll be on around 7:30pm to 9. That work?
---
Thanks for the info guess I didnt pay attention until I was swarmed by 50 super mutants I was a wacking and a hacking and chopping that meat wholesale
---
Account, not a key, they are dirt cheap. And yeah, it's most likely stolen, so I'm storing anything on it, just using it as a middleman.
---
It‚Äôs called holdfast nations at war. Entire game balanced around that with 50v50
---
Send you one when I get off work. I just got back in a few days ago.
---
&gt;I'd even say it underlines my argument as all those items could reasonably be expected to be present at launch, seeing how they are either obvious or even industry standard
---
Idk if I'd go so far as to say they are all that obvious or even industry standard,  though I do get your point. On the other hand, it is their first MP game and they do have to get the experience to know what is obvious...if that makes sense?
---
Fosho thanks for the info!
---
Haha, so do I, all the time. Unless you're carrying fluxes on you, death is but an inconvenience.
---
I'm over it. It's an easy fix, I guess I'm just curious about the mentality of these morons repeatedly wasting time and ammo on some stupid shit like that. I mean, is it just about being irritating in any way possible? Were they actually accomplishing something?
---
And really, I didn't think they'd kill my brahmin 4 times. I'll admit, that's on me.
---
IF YOU FANCY A GOOD CUPPER
---
It's cos it was shit, NW is shit aswell. But I think that will get better as a result of loosing survival so I think it's a step in the right direction. Maybe instead of 2 shitty pvp modes, well get 1 decent one.
---
Yes. I have a ts ff fr .50 cal. Heavy weapons same share legendary roll possibilities
---
It's not a skin though, it's a whole other fridge
---
because it gets overshadowed b pay to win and other Bethesda fuck ups
---
Came here to say I just did the forest one yesterday. 
---
I've noticed a lot fewer events in general though. Don't know if I have just had bad luck with servers but I haven't seen feed the people in awhile and I'm all out of stew
---
Yes. I'm trying to sell you anything but I have a 2\* Two shot gatling with a 25% faster firing rate in my vending machine.
---
Oh maaaaan I have to check this I normally bench repair.
---
You must be really young or naive
---
Bethesda get plenty of credit for their world building. It's what they're known for and probably the main reason people tolerate their shortcomings in other areas.
---
Very cool camp; a lot of my favorites that I see when camp hopping are the ones built into the e environment as opposed to building on or around it. Nice work!
---
Thanks that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for but never seen one and at a 228 lvl didn‚Äôt want to sound dumb.
---
I didnt care for it because everyone bitched when i was on. Id let people do there thing then kill em theyd then respawn and start freaking out on mic being like if you wanna kill people go on nuclear winter survival mode is not for killing people and your hacking no way you are doing that much damage its like jeeze people sorry for running a bloodied build with a be handmade and killing people you know one of the big reasons to be on survival mode.
---
I loved the gammode, hated how they had a pvp gamemode is broken af pvp. No one wants to not even have a chance to fight back against someone who spent actual money on Ebay for OP duped weapons
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate for me. It‚Äôs a really nice look but I‚Äôm not gonna pay 700 for something I already have. It should be cheaper if you already own the fridge
---
I highly doubt that. And there was no smugness in my comment.
---
I am loving the lack of self-awareness in your comment though so thanks for that
---
Here in the NYC area on PS4 I had 3-4 servers during peak times. 1-2 off peak.
---
PS4?
---
My hostess did, along with 4or 5 bags of decorations, lol
---
Survival was terrible. Anything worse than someone hiding in your base in stealth and repeatedly wiping you out with 2 hits?
---
I didn't like not being able to fast travel anywhere and the places you could being filled with campers. I was a big proponent of the mode before it released, even wanting the no fast travel aspect and wishing that there was ammo loss on death too. Then I played the mode and realized how toxic PvP chat is lol
---
first atomic shop update for October and No halloween items yet?
---
it feels like bethesda going to drop the ball like they did on saint patrick's day.
---
There‚Äôs no data mining. People just state that their personal experiences are data mined lol. I have asked this also and get downvoted ü§£
---
You can be disappointed with the other 22 people that actually played that game mode.
---
The rest of us could care less.  We are excited they scrapped it and sent the devs to adventure mode.
---
Imo 50 scrip is worth more than 200 caps.
---
I can confirm this as well my friends fixed itself
---
There's a running joke among the FFXIV community that "glamour is the true endgame" -- which probably applies to most online games to some degree, except in FO76, it's pretty much the *only* endgame.
---
lol
---
Whew. Glad to hear that was just a rumour! Luckily I have some poison resist assassins and unyeilding pieces taking up space in my stash. Glad I didn't scrip those!
---
Survival just turned two much into adventure with raiding people's camps harder with them regening every time it was anoying and as much fun as it used to be
---
A related note: a lot of people (including the editor-in-chief of Game Informer) don't like FO76 without even playing it. They think Fallout is only a single-player game, and see no reason why it should be a semi-MMO. We have an uphill battle.
---
It jumped out the window
---
Now that you have it, it's like wanting another power armor or backpack skin instead of the one you bought
---
Boo fucking hoo, so sad üò≠
---
Everyone else's "fight" lol dude everyone wants to nerf this power armor or bring everything to the same level which would probably make the armor THEN not worth the grind I just pvpd for an hour against a teammate with the armor and my junkies build was ABSOLUTELY viable against it its basically the same issue against good bloodied builds if he gets the drop on me I'm dead if I get the drop on him he's dead and if you're quick with nuke colas with the perk or have super stimpacks handy you can out heal the acid and stay in the fight this armor has a good set bonus and that acid IS mean but it doesn't make "all builds pointless against it". The builds in this game have NEVER really been level to begin with you just have to adapt to the playing field you don't change it to fit YOUR needs because who's fighting for whose rights then?
---
Why would we make a big stink about losing a mode we don't care about?  For those of us who don't play it because it doesn't interest us, why would we care?
---
Clearly we don't think it was the best way to play the game or we'd care.
---
I've been on it for completing atoms challenges and there was never people around.  There was like 8 to 13 people on!  How sad and lonely. 
---
I think the majoring of people who play mmo's want to play with more people, not murder everyone you find.  I can do that in my single player games.
---
In the Atomic Shop it states that the Black Shovel Backpack does not require the backpack from the Tadpole Challenge quest. All the others state clearly that they do require it.  Caveat emptor.
---
I haven‚Äôt used it, what quest do you get it from and how to start the quest?
---
Thats what i use. With buffs and perks spread right..i can hit for like 900 at night with full auto habdmade. So ill spray a clip or two at the queen and then blast away at the mobs while the melee guys destroy her. Some of them hit at 30k per stroke so i get my hits in and take out the mo s so they can hit without dying. I die maybe once or twice a day. I run bolstering armor witb armor backpack and im just shy of 500 damage and energy. Its a good build. Not max dps but good enough support role
---
Interesting. I feel like its always raining. More rad storms and thunderstorms would be great. Storms in RDR2 are amazing.
---
"A¬†paywall is¬†a feature of a website or other technology that requires payment from users in order to access additional content or services."
---
e.g atom shop content, which is what I was referring to.
---
Must be secrets only the master race can know lol
---
Yes, it was too much to maintain for the less than 50 people playing who actually logged into Survival.  There were only ever 1 or 2 servers (24 people per server) and that is not enough of a playerbase to waste resources on developers.
---
OH man, those are the worst!
---
there was also a time i thought atom shop is for revenues, for helping run the game, get content...today to me it's just the biggest scam in gaming history, a rip off and robbery...milk its gamers and give nothing in return...there's a million bugs in game, 99% in it since beta, and how long do we have to deal with this grafton mayor already? any fix in sight? ppl need to wake the fuck up and see it how it is...bethesda arent that cool developer anymore...they are just scum!
---
It was fine until everyone realized they suck at pvp, and cheesed out on stealth boys and tesla rifles. 
---
Sadly, there's been an uptick of these people returning to adventure, so what little fun there was in contesting workshops and battling people that don't need crutches has all but dried up.
---
yes
---
You need a hug...
---
Because there might come a day when all 400 of my stuffs break all at once lol.
---
Free items in vending machines ;) I do it all the time!
---
Ah sure, this and other temporary solutions works, i mean the Bethesda need to fix it.
---
Mayor for a day in watoga think u get an alert when u enter the city to go to the mayor's office, it looks a bit difficult but we will see going to start it tomorrow.
---
I still haven't managed to get the tenderiser. Maybe next time. Its more for display than anything else.
---
Not if you launch the nule in the right spot, so bloodied builds can kill her without keep dying from rads.
---
Responders are kinda like them...
---
Sure, it happens too.
---
KerrSG1 - Did you have any issue creating the new backpack? I bought it but cannot craft it because it tells me that I have to buy it from the Atomic Shop first. Bethesda support is looking at what happened. I'll update this when the issue is resolved. Cheers.
---
Yeah, I was thinking it'd be cool to help him out, but I'm on PC.
---
I know of that issue. Especially the older...
---
p.s. try BL3...just AWESOME and GREAT game and helped me, get away from this broken piece of shit. i ever loved fallout and hate to hate this new one...but bethesda didnt helped make me love it, but even more showed me they arent woerth shit. i still hope i can love it again some day. but i'm realistic and not dumb enough to believe it will happen in near future...if not never at all.
---
I liked the concept of survival - ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù anyone could fight at any time.
---
But As it stood, survival mostly just seemed like more hassle and risk for limited benefit and no protection from constant harassment.
---
I thought it had much potential, but implementation was poor. Marked on the map sucked, and damage caps were a terrible attempt to balance. I had some super fun  PvP fights, but never really liked the whole system. Still it will be missed (by a few of us.)
---
Yeeaaa kinda
---
Damn, someone is finally helpful and not crying on this subreddit, thx
---
The world they created is terrific.  But the game didn't sell well initially, and it's pretty obvious post release plans for the game including the post release development budget for things like fixing bugs was slashed drastically.
---
It became more in line with what you might expect from a 30 dollar game with no monthly subscription fee.  It's fine for that price.
---
All Rise is legit for the carry weight reduction mod. With the right mods the only thing that is going to beat it is a 2-3 star Todd roll legendary super sledge.  I assume they are uber rare i never see the All Rise or any decent legendary sledgehammers for sale at peeps camps.
---
The amount of people affected by moldy helmets has been way overtalked. It was about 30 or 40 people that got affected, the rest were recalled before they were even sold.
---
On purpose. I'm not aware of a traditional "dud" gift for Halloween.
---
Put the switch low on a wall and then put a piece of furniture in front of it, or in an interior room behind a locked door.
---
Hide the switch bud. I ran all my powered stuff to a main line with one main switch..which i keep in a locked room. Only switch anyone can mess with is for the garage door..which..ok. Close my door then.
---
Just more bitch.
---
Do a poo in the pumpkin
---
I mean I hope people actually did. It would be nice to understand the game more. Let me know if anyone leads you to something. üò¨
---
Works fine for ESO. Don‚Äôt know why they wouldn‚Äôt for 76
---
I will let u know later tomorrow, I'm working on that quest mayor for a day and let u know how it goes.
---
I felt New Vegas touched on the "alive, but devastated" thing very well. the paradox of the lush and fruitful desert was really cool.
---
Counterpoint: Adventure Mode is the best way to play the game.
---
If I manage to break into your locked camp I'll turn everything off for sure :)
---
lolol
---
They took it out so that they can focus on wastelanders and not worry about breaking survival going forward, from the reaction in the community I think they'll bring it back after the first couple of patches to wastelanders. The main issue is the disruption to the entire game we already know so it would be much easier for them to scrap what they had for survival and release it back in at a later date!
---
Known
---
Search the answer on reddit. It‚Äôs been covered.
---
I'm with you on that, problem is we might both be dead in real life before that happens
---
Nope. If you're lucky they might multiply in your stash. Sell sell sell!!!
---
Not locking my whole camp want to lock a garage with my vending machines when I‚Äôm near max caps.

---
Put your mittens up!
---
Yeah I mean it‚Äôs like 20 pounds I can‚Äôt afford to display it, or sell it.
---
Survival sucks, could give two shits that its gone.
---
I second this. Ive had guns and armor i swore id never get rid of..use it or put it in my stash..and months later trade it for the next thing i swear id never trade lol
---
Follow the posts of  [https://www.reddit.com/user/Gearsthecool/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gearsthecool/posts/)
---
Because it's almost been a year and we're still waiting for actual content in that world
---
I LOVE the Atom Cats lol
---
Maybe, my gt is felipe5083
---
My T-51b with Emergency Protocols always keeps me alive. Really solid mod in case you're a bloodied heavy build.
---
Seen it as much as 5k or around where you said. Got my second one so maybe I light it off at the last cookout!
---
I believe it works for everyone. It makes the target take more damage instead of buffing your damage.
---
Which is why it's a shame that there's virtually no reason to visit Ash Heap and Toxic Valley after you're done with them, story-wise/content-wise. Ash Heap especially is one of my favourite looking regions in the Fallout series, and yet there's just fuckall to do.
---
I have been trying to get the bear arm plan so I can roll them myself. What effects do you need on the fixer? If I get one I'll let you know.
---
800 atoms.
---
Because it's booooring.
---
You hardly meet. You hardly initiate contact. Yes, you could say it's on me, but then again, there is nothing forcing or enticing me enough to cooperate with other people on the mic. There is hardly any difficulty in doing stuff alone, on the contrary, you want to avoid high level players as much as possible, since they spawn enemies way out of your reach. 
---
When you create a world like this, you want to focus on emergent gameplay and creating memorable moments. Fo76 does have it, at least I'm guessing from some of the posters... but it's too big and empty for it's own good. When playing survival, the first hour was a blast, I was so jumpy, I paid attention to everything, I thought someone was about to end me at any moment. Then I realized that unless you're looking for trouble, you're just free to do the same shit you do in vanilla, since the map is so big.
---
The players are spread thin over a huge area and frankly, most of the time I have the impression that I'm playing a singleplayer, barebones sequel to fallout 4.
---
I am in the same boat. Missed most of first one but love to collect. If only stash limit would allow. I know we started with much less but it still kills collecting.
---
At some point, you just have to paper bag some items.  40 lbs is a bit much, and if you constantly farm SBQ you will always have an influx.
---
If the melee mechanics are hit-or-miss, I feel like the act of fishing would be a clunky mess
---
I‚Äôve been playing bloodied for hundreds of hours and still die all the time, imo playing bloodied provides the only real challenge in this game and if they nerf it I‚Äôll prob leave 76 forever
---
Yea, wish they wouldve had a bigger part in 4

if your on ps4 i could hook you up

&gt;Wait, you guys are making sales?
---
I'm out in the boonies near WesTek and I make sales all the time.  I constantly have to shut it off until I do some spending of my own. I dont sell super cheap but neither do I ask crazy amounts and I turnover a dozen or more weapons and armor a week
---
There‚Äôs no data in any post. There are copy and paste Bethesda update information and the ‚Äúdatamine‚Äù info is a link with pictures. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Raiders, but without the chem abuse. 
---
You want it? Get it! Even if you die trying.
---
Thanks bud, but on Xbox.
---
Gotcha, thanks
---
Came here to say the exact same thing. What the actual DUCK ? 700 atoms for one weapon skin?
---
I personally think those were meant to be the "daily" zones. There's loads in both of them, of course there's lots in every zone. At least they added the Lying Lowe and Ever Upwards questlines to them
---
I read that as (Mutant Slides) for a second. I was like wow that would be cool seeing hordes of super mutants sliding down the hills and the stupid shit they‚Äôd say

And where do you think we got the photos from?  :)

Trading sub.
---
Like I said previously i like to play devil's advocate (being a cute) but also get the point across that people like holidays and bitching about Bethesda. And ranting about it is not going to change their likes or dislikes. 
---
I'm more of a fan of Halloween than my 2 kids. Holidays in general. I do look forward to video game content for those holidays as well. It would eb awesome to deck out my C.A.M.P with Jack Skellington. Or the fat man raider style saint nick. 
---
Libtard? Is that a trump support, a sheer supporter, a may supporter? Or someone that actually cares about any political things? Lol
---
I have no clue what an HOA actually is. I wa0s just going off of merica TV shows. 
---
That would annoy me as well. If I want to redneck my yard fuck ya let me. Clearly there are alot of those from what you are saying.
---
My biggest problem with pvp as it is now is that you often get one shot or nuked before you even notice the guy. I think what would be nice is if they gave you a 5 second countdown, a notice that so and so will be hostile in 3..2..1 go sort of deal. That way both parties have time to either brace for battle or flee, and then you have a whole different experience of hunter/hunted if they flee
---
&gt; do you want people to forget all other ugly stuff they did
---
I'm pretty sure that was OP's goal with this thread aka "Stop criticising my favourite thing and favourite company! &gt;:O" etc
---
Crafting what backpack?  I've completed the whole Tadpole line, have the plans for the regular backpack, and several mods.  I've been able to craft the black backpack and mod it with the expanded carrying capacity.
---
When a quest takes me indoors if the building is large with multiple exits I will turn off all the other quest markers that could potentially lead out of the building and then I just turn them back on once I leave. When it comes to having multiple markers outdoors to avoid getting disoriented and heading towards the wrong one I usually place my custom marker next to the one that I actually want to go to.
---
Rust, Ark, the forest, seven days to die, literally every survival game in early access 
---
And in the case of BOTH Ark and yes, Rust... both are more stable, run better and technically superior. 
---
Yes.. you‚Äôre right... Fallout 76 ISNT even close to them in terms of polish, and they‚Äôre buggy messes. 
---
But enjoy your garbage fallout 4 early access mod
---
The less salty response is that gears takes the most recent downloaded update,  pulls out the ATX files and puts them on Imgur in about 20-30 minutes- ish 
---
Its not hard, but he's done it so many times as you can see from his post history that no one else bothers anymore
---
Yeah exactly i was like wtf when i saw that on the shop this is a new level of lazy they aren't even puting any effort into making new designs just charging for a reskin that could be easilly combined with a regular army helmet, its insulting to the customers not to mention that i still have the Atom Shop camo armor bug that i bought with Atoms but can't use, i sent a ticket they said they are aware of the bug but cash cow atom shop is priority number one instead of fixing the game.
---
Personally I am tired of tires
---
I hope they do something fun like this for Halloween. It's such a big holiday in the fallout universe
---
Cuz its 
---
1.Laggy
---
2.Empty
---
3.Boring cuz Empty
---
Appalachia is gorgeous!! Its Bethesdas best and I mean that BUT!!! Its empty! So hopefully wastelanders turn up!
---
Maybe my definition of ‚Äúdata‚Äù is different then yours. I assume it would be a large gathering of information from different platforms and players. Not one dudes opinion and screen shots of costumes. What is data mined suppose to be?
---
Make the nights darker again. Who the actual fuck was complaining about that?!
---
What sort of thing are you after?
---
&gt; and the lore spits on existing lore. Brotherhood of steel? Not a thing 20 years after the war.
---
This is my favorite part of that rant. My dude, the Brotherhood of Steel was founded three days *before* the bombs fell. That's lore from **FALLOUT 1**. Gotta love when people complain about things they know nothing about.
---
That's fair I suppose, though Ever Upwards kinda goes all over the map. Lyin' Lowe was alright. I just wish there could be some more interesting activities than those fun park dailies that fail to activate more than they actually activate.
---
I'm trying! I just don't want to get my hopes up. They just have everything else on their roadmap but nothing about survival mode or PVP besides improvements to the core game which is rather vague.
---
So, just being a raider? Theres many factions of raiders. My favorite raider group is the Fire breathers!
---
I was level 205 before I got an explosive rifle off a drop.
---
You can add a switch between the grid and the line connecting the vendors...I did this when initially setting up. Made my Gates and downstairs lights run off the same switch so when I "close shop" it cuts the vendors, lights above the vendors, and access to them.
---
We don't have logic gates anymore otherwise I'd get crazy with it
---
Yup. You got it!
---
Pip Fall
---
Couldn't give 2 shits
---
Luck, or patience.  Those are your options.
---
Rifleman is rough, as you said getting swarmed is trouble.  That's why I changed over to commando.  But if you're sticking with sniping, get something instigating.
---
I see decent semi-auto rifles from time to time, even an instigating hunting rifle will kill anything from sneak.
---
At any rate, you find nothing until you can farm high level mobs (so into your 60's or 70's for most people), so the hunt starts there.  You've put in 50ish levels of looking.  I've got about 120 more than that, and while I've found a few really nice pieces, most I've bought (from selling all the bloodied or unyielding pieces I've found, or from scrip).  Shopping *is* harder lately, but you can still find things.
---
I was about level 150 when I replaced my 1* instigating hunting rifle, and about 10 levels later just chucked sniping completely.  You just have to spend the time farming and shopping, there's really nothing else to it.  You'll get lucky eventually.
---
Couldn't care less
---
The only real way to get a good gun, let alone the gun you want, is trade or buy one from someone.
---
Maybe if all the PvPers who are now suddenly saddened by the loss of Survival had played it‚Äîinstead of going seal clubbing at workshops in Adventure‚Äîit would still be around. 
---
It was pretty rare to see more than one server running on Xbox in the US, I can only imagine what other regions looked like. Nobody cared to play Survival when it was around, so it shouldn‚Äôt be a shock that nobody cares that it‚Äôs gone.
---
Just need 50 lbs of storage
---
Hang loose dude.... that a califorard saying right? But ya I live next to a bigger devils advocate in the White House? Oops you meant the other end right? Why do you assume I'm from merica is that where all cunts come from? We are everywhere lol. Down under and across the sea, or borders. 
---
Lol, sorry I should stop I clearly struck a nerve and some people take public forums seriously I might offend some more. We are not changing anyone's minds here. Things will stay the same.
---
In the end we all kill super mutants and scorchedbeast and trade and have fun.
---
You say it‚Äôs the best way to play the game but most of your points were just game stability, if all it had to offer was more xp and getting randomly killed by a high level then that‚Äôs not worth it, you can‚Äôt expect others to have the same views as yours while not looking at theirs, PvE is a drab but that‚Äôs what all fallout games are based on? 
---
There was no tension survival was literally a contest between who had the better handmade or Tesla, and you can‚Äôt be surprised most people don‚Äôt like that
---
It's not one dude's opinion. It's literally just examining the game's files, finding the the ATX files,  and finding what is new between each update.
---
A guild system like eso would be nice as well lol
---
I have a couple friends who play that game, so I may have to check it out when I've got the cash for it. As it is, I don't have much money to spare, so no longer spending money in the Atom Shop frees up quite a bit for me. 
---
I think that it's this particular fallout that they're screwing up so badly is what's such a huge punch in the gut for me. A large part of my soft spot for Fallout is that, had my dad been a gamer when he was alive, the Fallout series would have been his favorite, and the option for us to play it together via 76 would have meant for so many more good memories if he were still alive and the game wasn't busted as fuck. Unfortunately, he's not alive, and the game is so busted that, even if he was alive, he'd hate how screwed up 76 is. I've been playing the game as a connection with my dad and it hurts on a personal level to see what they're doing with this game.
---
omg I‚Äôm going to put a vending machine outside with a trick or treat sign on it!!! 
---
Thanks for the awesome idea!!! :)
---
The antique shop and near by the power station a death claw is sometimes fighting them. In cranberry bog.
---
If we're taking nuka world into account, I would say the business guys  (don't remember their name).
---
Other than that, I'm fine with just a normal raider that cares only for himself.
---
What is your preferred weapon and what armor are you looking for?  I'm on Xbox and may have a thing or two I can help you out with.
---
 **"Fallout 76** supports up **to** 24 **players** per **server**, and these participants **can** talk, trade, and group-up with one another."   
---
This is literally the least impressive thing about the game, and thats saying something.   
---
What a shill post. They aren't getting credit because there is nothing special about this world. Hell even The Commonwealth wasn't that great. Capital Wasteland was awesome IMO along with most of the DLC from FO3.   
---
But come on? Even in YOUR very post you say nothing about the world other than that drivel about 24 person servers with voice chat. In summary your post is   
---
"Cosmetics are lame, this is an online game, I like online games like (X Y and Z). I like other stuff about the game to, but I like the world cause reasons. Bethesda did some dumb stuff, but I like the world cause reasons.  
---
"Edit - I know  bethesda did bad stuff, but im talking about the world, and the server.   
---
"Edit - Moldy helmets bad. I like the world""  
---
Your whole post is literally centered around ONE sentence. The fact that you like servers in video games. Not even a unique thing they did with multiplayer. Just the fact that it exists similarly to 99% of multiplayer games.    
---
Yet somehow you stretched that into a full paragraph in which these shills are eating up.   
---
Is this just another instance of a poorly executed PR post? Like when Bethesda hired all of those people to post online about how they found their "true love" in fallout 76. Like 5 people all in the same week lmfao.
---
Thunder mountain substation by Watoga...kill the ants before the deathclaw does.
---
Appalachia is Beautiful! Its just plagued with bugs! These rad roaches be kickin my ass
---
It can take a few forms.  The ATX "data-mine"  are purely using a fallout esm extractor to pull the files out.  The photos are made by Bethesda when they are ready to put them live on the Atomic Shop. And they are predictably in a folder called Atomic Shop.
---
Other "Data-mining" is using the version of xedit that  [https://www.reddit.com/user/eckserah/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/eckserah/posts/)   created\\updated that can read the game files and how they are all linked.  For example, some of my libraries I've used to explain things, but I'm just a newb at this:

But I'd follow Eckserah if you are looking for more data-driven posts
---
The power substation north of Watoga, there's usually a bunch of ants fighting a Deathclaw. The Butcher's Bounty perk should help you collect extra meat.
---
The skull raider mask doesn't.
---
Are you guys ever going to release the Atom Shop combat armor Skins bug??? I already sent a ticket you guys said you are aware and closed it, 2 weeks later and no fix whats the point of getting Atoms items if it can become bugged in a poorly tested update and you guys don't even care to hotfix the bugs you introduced.
---
what is a price they are selling at? im thinking of unloading my magazine/bobblehead displays as they take too much camp space
---
Now that is a good response! That still to me at least does not sound datamined but now I can understand where he got the images and makes sense. Can he also do that to check the rng system? Did he help push bethesda to acknowledge the limb dmg drops?
---
Lol I just noticed your faction that's such a enclave thing to say. Conform to my ways only. Lol cheers mate.
---
I wish I took pics of my FO4 settlement projects.  With mods, it's incredible what you can build in there.  So much fun. Here, it's hard to get a 3 story building made in 4 hours.
---
Easy, I stopped PAYING for Atoms months ago. Didn't buy the previous fridge, won't buy until the Nuka one is available. Bethesda has gone off the rails with it's handling of the Atomic Shop.  I don't pay anymore for Atoms, I just work on earning them $0.20 or so a day on challenges, sometimes hit some of the weekly ones.  But I won't pay another dime until they change their practices in the Atomic Shop.  The game can shut down for all I care, I won't invest anymore in it.
---
It would increase the caps cap and that's not guna happen
---
Hell yeah thanks for the information. This is helpful and should be upvoted to the top of the discussion.
---
If I go to a restaurant that makes legendary steak and my legendary steak falls through the table and I have to blow it out with a grenade so I can get at it, I'm not going to be inclined to give lots of credit for a steak well done.
---
Stalker's legendary effect: Completely remove it from all melee weapons, a static 95% vats chance increased to 100% is just useless and annoying to have dropped.
---
The point being the fridge should have been free with the skins being in the atom shop.
---
Now anybody who already bought the regular fridge and wants the better one has to spend even more atoms.
---
Survival's supposed to be gone today
---
Ok. You are on xbox. Whats your gt and what kind of gun do you like to use?
---
I play five dif. Characters at the same time. That means More chances to find good equipment. I suggest you get into fights with real high level enemies, hard √°reas, and shop More often. No secrets, really.
---
Well, no. Or do you mean it would mean people could stockpile more? Because people are stockpiling right now and the people getting hurt are the solo players only.
---
Are you about to cry?
---
Multiple times already
---
I have a quad explosive assault rifle you can buy for 2k
---
That was Eckserah I believe who caught the limb damage and sent it to Devann 
---
The RNG system is basically a bunch of lists that lead to other lists
---
 List 1 contains : Item 1, List 2 
---
 List 2 Contains : item 2, list 3 
---
 list 3 containts : item 3, item 4 
---
 List 1 has the following drop rates : item 1 : 50%, List 2 : 50% 
---
 List 2 has the following drop rates : item 2 : 25%(50% of 50%), List 3 : 25%  
---
 List 3 has the following drop rates : item 3 : 12.5%(50% of 25%), item 4 : 12.5%
---
Firebreathets had training and tactics. 
---
That always wins out. 
---
Then again, the Forged would burn entire cities down just because.
---
I have found that 90% of the time the best way to get a good weapon is to go buy a good weapon from a vendor. It is nearly a guarantee that within one week you will loot a better weapon than the one you bought. 
---
Because science.
---
No, I said it the right way. 
---
You chose to interpret it another way and correct me.
---
You sir, are wrong.
---
I specifically said we could care less.  and we could.  caring less would not be posting.
---
I completely forgot about stalker I agree in melee combat you‚Äôre already fighting most the time and stalker is just useless
---
It's a conspiracy. Are you about to cry?
---
They do sometimes drop a tid bit for the proletariat console caste just to remind us of their power, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath, friend.
---
Since I live on the river this would be fun.  I could fish from my worshop and collect junk at the same time. Maybe have a heavily irradiated rainbow trout with 2 heads be the legendary spawn.  You have to club it to death after you reel it in like on the TV shows.
---
&gt; like always
---
Survival was added in March and NW in June
---
I've always had success near Morgantown. Probably because I specialize in a fully stocked assortment of ALMOST every single component in the game. People just getting to Morgantown in their teens and high levels clearing out my acid/adhesive is most of my sales. I get a lot of repeat visits because once people see my stock, they know they can get anything they desperately need in the junk department. It allows me to charge even more for hot items like acid, springs, etc. Stimpacks and drugs of any kind sell like fucking hotcakes even when you inflate your margins. Plans, drugs, and junk is all I sell and I consistently make 1-3k caps a day.
---
Lmao. You learn that by scrapping fireaxes. It's the only mod for them so shouldn't take long.
---
I see now where the term datamined comes from and my understanding of its use was wrong.
---
That'll be $7
---
I look at my husband (the real life one, not Farkas, lol) and I think "yes, I did learn a lot from my ex."
---
I look at Fallout 76 and I think to myself "have I learned nothing?!"
---
So every time you get a legendary steak it falls through the table or does it happen on occasion and then you over react like it happens with every steak?
---
Because it's empty.
---
Thats not what he said. He said he likes "The world" and the servers. You're right in thats probably what he's implying but it was explained like shit. Also the world isn't anything special.
---
As a longtime Fallout player and being from Ohio, I had tears of joy when I saw Ohio River Adventures. I stumbled on it and didn't know it was in the game. It will probably be the only time Ohio will be in a Fallout game. I appreciated that detail of having the Ohio River in the game. There are tons of bugs and issues with the game, but that was one of the best moments in the fallout series for me. I appreciate the time they put in making me feel like I am playing in the Midwest. The game feels like home :)
---
Good riddance.
---
Preferably bloodied double vats I think. Yeqh I think that bear arm plan is probably the toughest of the new weapons to get since I think you only get a chance if alll three monsters survive in that quest. At least never met anyone who didn't get it that way.
---
Yea that‚Äôs what I was thinking. It‚Äôs like for me, I‚Äôm going to be getting a lot more use out of a god tier weapon than an outfit I wear once a week for atoms!
---
I refuse to believe there were 50 people only. I played a lot and joined maybe three dif. Servers in a couple of disconnects. I think we were not a lot of people, but would have thought nuclear winter was less successful.
---
Compared to previous fallout games, the setting itself is quite nice. Good variation and colouring. Tons of  interesting unmarked places with stories to tell.
---
It's been by far my fav fallout setting.
---
No mention of the Children of Atom.
---
I want to worship the bomb and all it has provided us in this wasteland wonderland.
---
Those are not RadStags, those are Stags blessed by Atom.
---
lol better in what way? The stainless steel is much nicer for food, Arktos Pharma with a bloody handprint? I wouldn't stick that shit in my kitchen. It's going in my Arktos Pharma lab which I really doubt more than a few people have. You gotta pay attention to datamines, I skipped the first fridge because I saw this one. Now I can understand you getting mad if this was the Nuka Cola fridge but I doubt they release that one so soon now. I view it like backpack skins. You bought the Corvega and now you want the Mr. Pebbles. And don't say "but there isn't a base version" because at this point you already bought it so now you are purchasing another skin
---
Lol I know I‚Äôm already searching for one now! I got that one for 5k months and months ago so I might not get one for that but I‚Äôll get another one some day!
---
Damnit. I thought they would have fixed it with this patch. 
---
That‚Äôs annoying.
---
Yea that‚Äôs what I was thinking. I‚Äôve gotten more hours of use out of those weapons than I have the whole life of that outfit
---
Also Butcher's Bounty gives you a chance of getting meat from them if the deathclaw has already killed them - which can be handy!
---
R O A S T E D
---
Of course that's what i do every time I call out a low effort post.
---
Its not you, its the community at large.   Eck used to hand out his modified version of xedit pretty freely until people started posting flat out wrong things here on reddit and youtube- so he started pulling back. We now have a shared discord-  Gears is on our team as is CodytheRat if you see him posting.  Lots of us.   
---
But yeah, you should always ask for photos -  its not hard to screenshot and put on Imgur
---
Yes and meat hook which also counts and one handed
---
I agree. Similar activities can exist in different video games.
---
If you don't like survival just don't play it. I hope it will be implemented somehow. It would be really cool if we could create our own faction with our friends and fight against other factions in a mode or some areas like workshop areas. I built a fortress in this game I'd like to see it not only against the scorchbeast but against someone with a brain lol. 
---
p.s. I don't like NW  I can't stand this battle royal trend but sometimes I play it just because it's there, stop complain about modes you don't like &lt;3
---
Same goes for the BBQ - except they should just give up the ghost and fix the BBQ to behave like the ones they sold for what was a singular week.
---
Anyone have the airstream trailer? That‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs called but it‚Äôs what it looks like. I‚Äôm thinking I may pick that up tonight. Will be a nice little portable camp since I like to drop my camp periodically where needed. This will look much nicer than the single platform and extractor setup I currently have.
---
you're the naive one if you think mob justice is at all viable
---
Well i'm glad you're enjoying it :D
---
I guess so! With faster reload. I guess that‚Äôs a factor too
---
Refusal to believe does not mean its not wrong.
---
Everyone else on the internet already knows this to be fact.
---
Not seeing that Raider Vendor bot yet
---
I feel like your analogies are belittling and dismissing the very real problems that many have had with Bethesda and FO76. A lot of people paid somewhere between $60-$100 for the FINISHED game and promised accessories. The accessories were not as promised, the game was supposed to be out of Beta at release and it wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not even convinced we‚Äôre even out of BETA yet. Don‚Äôt get me wrong - the world they created is immaculate... but you can also say that without dismissing all the real problems with the game. I started playing about a month ago and it‚Äôs not nearly as buggy but the disconnects, the bugs, AI issues hurts the playability and the ability to enjoy it.
---
Hahha
---
And that is exactly why I was challenging it. Glad you commented.
---
Everything can be countered by spamming aid items, when one side has to do it to keep viable, and the other doesn't need it at all to dominate, there's no relevance in compared builds. 
---
"Any good bloodied build" will not OHKO me, can't happen, way too optimised. Most shots from strangler one-shot me.
---
Ok I'll admit ignorance to that. Just looked it up and you're right. So I'll withdraw that from my rant so I dont misinform anyone.
---
You need the fixer plan, I thought I was just lucky. Without the fixer plan learned you will never get a fixer drop. I usually pick all top 3. Armor melee and ranged so I guess it‚Äôs ranged 3\* as well.
---
It‚Äôs an interesting world, but it‚Äôs devoid of life so it seems a lot smaller and comes across as boring as a result
---
I hope they get their act together like ESO and charge $50+ for a house as well.
---
Would also like to know if this is possible.
---
I'm lowballing at 150 per bobble,  75 for mags.  If I get one that would sell for actual use I bump up the price a bit :)
---
it's 10000% to force you into buying the whole bundle - and it sucks when you bought one and they just re-roll the bundle 3 weeks in a row.
---
Yeah hes been going around calling anyone who calls his low effort post out dumb and, asking them if they are gonna cry. Its clear he's either 13 or has the mentality of a 13 year old. I hope its the former, he will still have hope.
---
Seriously. Show me some new perks. Show me some of the new gauss weapons in action, along with the bow and arrow. Show off some new events, and perhaps a new end game boss finally since SBQ doesn't exist anymore lore wise. Really hoping they hit it out of the park with Wastelanders. With legendary perks pushed back till next year though, I wouldn't be surprised if the same goes for some of the new weapons and other things.
---
On sell?
---
I sell all my extras except for the Caps one for 20 caps. I also sell the robot armor plans for cheap because those were a pita to find.
---
Its been a problem for me since launch. Seems to happen most consistently when whatever I'm shooting at is also being attacked by something else, whether it's another AI or another player.
---
I have crafted the standard backpack from plans I found in-game. I have not completed the Tadpole quest line. I bot the Black Shovel Backpack from the Atomic Shop because all of the other backpack offerings required the Tadpole quest completion and it did not. Hopefully BS will give me an answer fairly soon. Thanks for your reply.
---
Thats how it feels. 
---
Atom Shop management should be feeling the heat right now hard.
---
They wouldn't fight. They would politely take turns tagging all the enemies until going back to each other's camps to show em off and build each other some stuff that the other doesn't know the plans for. Then they would try to friend each other but the friends list would bug out and they'd never see each other again.
---
Just playin! Of course they'd fight, its a mfing wasteland! Forged would win cuz they are hard as fuck.
---
I'm not sure if this works but you could grind the "repair X 76 times" challenges rather quickly.
---
Supposedly if you blueprint your vendor with things in it, it will save the items in it when you relocate. I may or may not have more than four vendors and since they patched that, I'm too afraid to move my CAMP so I can't say for sure.
---
In what way? You say it works well but HOW. What is an example other than just.   
---
"I like this. I think its good. I think it works good with this, this and this. Because reasons. "  
---
Why start this post if you have no idea what you are talking about?
---
It happens about a third of the time. I've only been playing since Friday, so there's the chance it gets not worse. I'm simply accepting what averages out to be mediocrity.
---
If you are talking about sale, i think you are late but you can buy retail versions from sites, its same
---
Truth!! ü§£
---
When you sour the goodwill given to you, it takes a while to earn it back. If you ever do.
---
They'll get credit for things when the game isn't a metamagic empowered cast of Creeping Doom.
---
We expect way to much apparently. *(even though what is expected is like the baseline for every other game that overlaps the FO76 circle)*
---
lmao got em
---
He doesnt say ONE thing about the world or setting other than "I like it" In his OP. The only thing he REALLY talks about is the online world, and how he enjoys games with online world.
---
This comment thread is MILES more in line with the OP than most comments here. Lmfao
---
Point out where he says ONE single thing about the setting in 76 in his OP. Literally just one thing other than "I like the world"
---
Even in his comments hes just calling people hipsters, dumb shits, and asking them if their gonna cry. He still has yet to say one thing about the setting. He DOES however bring up multiple times how he enjoys how the online world works with the game mechanics, but not the setting once
---
You are wrong.
---
I still do that. Join a friend, drop in a suitcase, leave, change character, come back. My Instigating faster swing baseball bat has been used by all my characters, I think.
---
What are the other effects on the weapon?  I know that the +250 DRWA effect has had a bug where it causes the other effects to sometimes not work
---
IIRC, goo'd/ashed enemies dont respawn ever until a server reset.
---
This is wonderful for farming any kind of meat because it works on all animal corpses, even spawns.
---
yeah, i have also been afraid of that, but once i figured out how to make the bungalows floating i will take a chance, but having the purifiers on the ground under it wont work, it will make the camp un placeable with the ground isn't 100% the same :/
---
It‚Äôs regularly offered at a discount. There are numerous platforms and retailers that sell the game and they always have it available for sale.
---
I would occasionally enter Survival Mode, and I agree! The majority of posters here aren‚Äôt... well... like you and I. (They‚Äôre wimps, and feel entitled to their aid/junk at all times)
---
It‚Äôs too bad. But I think Survival Mode will return one day.
---
nothing is locked, just dealing with very very very bored individuals who have nothing better to do....this is obvious...and rather sad tbh.
---
It can make a character a Powerhouse, that Is true. I moved things among my characters to benefit my latest one, who was level 6 and already had great weapons, great armor and lots of ammo. No struggle for him.
---
It‚Äôs disappointing you don‚Äôt get a legendary tenderizer option or drop.  I mean, even the salty or spicy mods are cool and such, but the damn thing weighs like 35 pounds and it‚Äôs nowhere near that great of a weapon.  
---
I‚Äôve collected most if not all of the plans and mods and clothing but really disappointed that the prime events yield such crap.  I mean, why not have a random 3 star drop?
---
I second this. I went rifleman first and loved one shotting enemies while sneaking but god help you if they reach you. Switching to Commando let's me kill most things in under five shots and not die when they swarm so I'd at least give it a shot.
---
I would guess yes, at least it would no longer be useless to PvE only players.
---
Just unplug or store them when you're maxed. Everything would get stored in your stored anyways. An when you want them back up set em up an then plug them in. Everything will still be in them just need to reprice.
---
not so easy, you can walk up to most lights and turn them off, switches do not matter.
---
Depends on whether Bethesda thought of it or not... :) I'm guessing NO, as they are NPCs.
---
Eh, it's only game. No need to be upset about anything that happens.
---
individual lights are what they are targeting, hiding things will not help matters
---
Nah I'm already dropping those on peoples beds. Gotta keep it fresh.
---
Sharks versus Jets!!!
---
They do not. It uses them all up at turn in. I think turning in more provides you with slightly more XP, up to four I believe, but it doesn't increase chance for rare drops or amount of rewards.
---
I think they mean "on sale..."
---
Nope, since npc's are not players and the prefix clearly says "+damage to players"
---
It's fucking depressing seeing how much this game fell into the in-game shop hole.
---
I would stroke Chally for that
---
Calibrated shocks, everything else is subjective. 
---
i like to use the jetpack and targeting hud. arms get nothing because it has basically no good mods
---
I co-lead a fan faction called Minutemen: West Virginia on Discord. 
---
Pretty much a place to hang out and help others. Focusing on PVE.
---
Ja-u gu-ai? Johu-gurt
---
Figured, thank you
---
Server lag has been bad, causing a lot of events to time out and fail
---
Its a 2 star with 10% dmg while aiming.
---
There are a lot of people mining the data for a lot of different reasons and purposes and it's not an organized team, but there has been considerable efforts to bring everyone together. I got into it from a mapping standpoint as I wanted a map of all the random encounter locations so I could get those darn civil war plans and halloween costumes. Currently there is an effort underway to get the main fallout wiki at fandom updated with info that comes directly from the files as opposed to pre-release data from the printed game guides or straight up conjecture created by players relying on feelings and experience as opposed to hard data. Unlike past fallout games, all the info is subject to change every time Bethesda releases a patch so it's a challenge keeping up and verifying what has and hasn't changed and getting info updated.
---
In addition to the atom store photos, here are some other fruits of datamining:

The artists are the only things are about within bethesda
---
You can try the giant teapot. I see one or two around there.
---
Unyielding, powered (AP Regen), and Sentinel is generally the best for bloodied commando. Some like to swap up the last slot since sentinel doesn't work while crouched/sneaking; slotting in some Cav for more versatile defense or weapon weight reduction. I like a few increased stealth pieces, but that's generally overkill with the agility that unyielding provides.
---
Thanks man
---
I've not read all the comments, but I kind of get what he is trying to say, sure it's subjective, but so are the negative comments towards the game, the amount of bugs etc. He does mention interactiveness and scope, and elaborated on the variety of the world in other posts.
---
Heres an upvote
---
Its a shame they‚Äôll never get the message because this subreddit is full of fan boys who will downvote you as soon as you doubt god emperor bethesda. 
---
Fuck this game, fuck this sub. Todd howard you lied to me and you owe me money.
---
You can play passive mode?
---
Calibrated shocks and emergency protocols if you're using bloodied heavy guns (which I am).
---
"With the amount of moving parts"
---
Lmfao bud. You're lost. TThe multiplayer gimmick in this game is about as innovative as smelling your own farts. What an idiot you sound like hahaha!
---
That be nice to have certain theme NW modes.
---
Like NO POWER ARMOR. Can you survive against TSE, without power armor?
---
Or explosive weapons only mode (Nukes,Rockets, TSE)
---
Or if they want unique ideas. How about a radiation only mode. You and players would be able to loot for stims, radaway, and RAD-X, Radiation suits, and Radium rifles.
---
Sentinel doesn‚Äôt work when crouched?!
---
gotta give the interns something to do
---
Yes. Everyone on the internet. Everyone!
---
What pvp? It's gone!
---
I think that;s how it worked in Fallout 4? So yes? 
---
I don't know if updating a legendary effect on existing weapons will break things but hopefully it changes to just 'humans' including players, so it doesn't mess up people who may currently be using them for PVP
---
Sure enough wouldn't u know, I ask for black paint for my rifle and what's in the atomic shop yep black painted rifle for a low price of 700 atoms...lol better get grinding
---
They should totally do it. Supporting Alts isn't just good for players, it's good business for a game that stays alive by selling cosmetic items.
---
Be sure to get the extra claw/blade/hook mods asap as they make a big difference. Instigating SS are the best prefixes for a non bloodied build, I would say. The DCG was my strongest and most favourite weapon ever, but I accidentally lost it so I now run with an instigating SS mole miner gauntlet. Unarmed is great. Definitely invest in the swing speed perk.
---
Definitely for this. Even if we ignore the potential gameplay effects, imagine sitting at home in your camp in a rocking chair or bar stool or that big fluffy Vault-Tec chair with a howling rainstorm battering your windows while you sip Nuka Cola next to the fireplace with your pet Yao Guai. Just the atmospheric presence severe weather would bring to the game would help make it feel more alive, like they've been talking about since the reveal. They've finally got functioning roofs that block rain, we should get to see the in action more!
---
Well if it‚Äôs showing the damage numbers but isn‚Äôt doing any damage, it might just be that the hits aren‚Äôt registering correctly due to sever lag or a bug.  But if it‚Äôs happening consistently then I don‚Äôt know what to tell ya.
---
The effect is originally from Fallout 4, though, where it was specifically against human NPCs. In the pre-Wastelanders version of Fallout 76, that had to be changed for obvious reasons. But it would make sense if it was made to work against players or human NPCs. Either that, or there would need to be a separate new prefix for the NPCs.
---
I'd say I'm about 150 hrs in and I've seen around 10
---
They're not pay to win, they're cheap enough you can get them with in-game earnings.  And you can easily survive and enjoy the game with none of them.
---
So everything you killed that was ‚Äúscorched‚Äù counted?
---
No, I'm sorry but he hasn't He's literally only said things about online related aspects. He has not once said "Game looks nice too" Not even that small of a comment about the actual setting.  Due to his poorly worded OP most people have no idea what the fuck he's actually on about.
---
Examples
---
" What I mean is that the world works quite well with the detail, the amount of players, crafting, base building, enterable buildings, the public events, the nukes and scorchbeast etc all in ONE world for the most part. It's not perfect by any means but no other game comes close to cramming that much content and activities in one world like the games in my OP. "
---
" Yeah sure modders deserve more praise I mean it took modders years to come up with a barely playable MP Skyrim. It's not the assets it's about all of the moving parts of a highly interactive RPG brought into the MP space. "
---
The event "Tea time" can spawn ants. 
---
Lucky Hole Mine (west of Fort Defiance) can spawn about 3 ants and if there are ants outside there's going to be ants inside the mine. You have to be quick though cause mole miners, that are a guaranteed spawn in there, will kill them off.
---
Yeah but sometimes you have to switch several times till you get one that's not doing it, and sometimes you never get a good server. Seems like it's lag related. I've noticed it seems to get a lot worse leading up to a disconnect and I usually see stuff like floor ghouls and enemies who talk after death along with it.
---
duly noted
---
it really weird an not consistent what is and isn't a gas mask.
---
Neither of the cultist hoods were, despite having a big ol' air filter shoved in the mouth.
---
This sounds so fun! I'd set up a shop to do something like this
---
I think its shit, as it was last time. Communication is painfully long, hardly anyone wears a headset, rarely reply to messages and just dont do the objectives. The waves are fun to fight i admit. But feel the combo of 2 events is pretty painful. 
---
The rewards are weak, ive scrapped most things ive recieved. Its turd. 
---
Give us decent dungeons with bosses like eso, they have the framework just use it. Dont try reinvent the wheel
---
What can you do with them, I got one but not sure what you can do with it
---
If necessary, the effect could remain exactly the same as before in PvP, but work similarly to ghoul slayer's etc. when fighting human NPCs (+30% damage on weapons, 15% reduction on armor). That is, assuming there will even be much of PvP left in adventure mode by the release of Wastelanders. :)
---
EP is the auto stimpack when low, correct?
---
There are non-cosmetic items in the Atom shop, but they are not necessary to enjoy the game. They are "pay to win" only under the looser definition of providing an in-game advantage. 
---
Thank you for your necrotic equine sadism.
---
Name me one thing in the Atomic Shop that's "necessary."
---
There‚Äôs nothing in the atom shop that‚Äôs necessary.
---
Fo76 is not really the kind of game where I want to suck someone dry and plant a stink bomb on their dead corpse with them watching from their ghost cam. It's more of a cooperative game that I can immerse in  without being randomly murdered.
---
I have one in my vending machine for 1000 caps and no sale yet...
---
Oh, well if you somehow got 50 scrip from an All Rise then that is amazing and I'd even say brilliant! Everyone else on Earth gets 15 scrip for a 2* weapon like that.
---
Not arguing anything about the game its self. I just see that you are telling that person they are off topic. When if fact he's one of the few who are actually ON topic. Due to no ones fault but the OP being a bit off (seemingly)
---
the atom shop prices make less sense than my vendor prices
---
That's why I always loved Fallout. Every game has had their issues, and I knew there would be even more this time as it was their first online multiplayer version of the game, but I was here for the story, and I feel I got that in spades. 
---
I've been slowing down as of late on the game, as I feel I've explored most everything, but I know I'll be back in for wastelanders.
---
No, that's medic pump. Emergency protocols is 50% damage mitigation and +25% move speed at &lt;20% health.
---
Sorry but There‚Äôs not one single atom shop item that has ever been sold that gives anyone an advantage of ‚Äúwinning‚Äù...
---
A few pieces of scrap from a collectron wins anyone what exactly? 2 pieces of rubber and other non needed stuff that players don‚Äôt have bills of already? 
---
Fridge for food? Where isn‚Äôt there a place you can kill something and eat it? Plenty of mole rats and other things you can eat and not spoil... 
---
Camo? Pretty paint doesn‚Äôt even help hide you
---
If a player used atoms earned are they paying to win? 
---
Or wait... are you talking about the mass load of players not having actually earned the armor or weapons they have... 
---
Should we blame ‚Äúduper‚Äôs‚Äù for unleashing hundreds if not thousands of weapons and armor sets? 
---
Saying this is pay to win is a joke at best a bad one... but please list out how people ‚Äúwin‚Äù that they ‚Äúpay‚Äù for... we‚Äôll wait....
---
Who's lola?
---
I have a base in the mire and it's raining everytime I'm there. I hate it
---
There is nothing in the atom shop that is required to play the game. Most of the atom shop is pure cosmetics there are a couple of items such as repair kits and scrap kits which depending on your point of view could be pay to win but they offer convenience to the player for cutting out a very small part of the grind. So rather than monitoring your weapons health and repairing it after a bench you can instead use a repair kit to fix it in the field. They also offer a better version of this kit in game. Scrap kits send your junk to your stach box and there is no version available in game.
---
I wouldn't say that the Collectron is necessary at all. However he is neat, and he adds some life to your camp. Plus he seems to be locked into a low level loot table just to let you know. I thought his junk was useful but you get the same junk you probably won't use over and over
---
The fridge is really only good if you're a big crafter. And the food will still spoil faster than if you had it on your personal inventory with good with salt or the refrigerated backpack.
---
Scrap kits are pretty much worthless. They're not obtainable in game but you can just fast travel to your camp plus it doesn't dismantle weapons, only junk.
---
Repair Kits aren't much better. Improved repair kits drop from the Queen and repair 50% more, plus they're free so much better
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of PvP gear for sale... so who knows...
---
It is a stunning game. I'm playing on a really old bad tv and still appreciate the sunlight dappling through the trees onto water. Abd when I go see a friend who's playing it on their curvy 68" tv omg gorgeous
---
Light. Wood. Laminate
---
OPs post IS about technology! Why in the flying fuck do people not see this? He has not ONCE referred to the actual setting. By world he means server. He enjoys how the online aspects works well with the gameplay mechanics and the open world aspect but NOT ONCE has he mentioned the setting itself being appealing.   
---
Also he is ONLY responding to comments in which people trash talk the multiplayer aspect. Why? Because that's what he's talking about. That's why he's ignoring all of the discussion about how nice the setting is. He's probably confused cause he doesn't realize the way he worded his post makes it sound like that's what he is trying to discuss.
---
I think you‚Äôre misinterpreting my explanation as me being angry. I didn‚Äôt buy the fridge. I‚Äôm not going to buy the new one either. 
---
I‚Äôm just trying to explain why people would be upset about it.
---
I'm not bitching about it, I'm just saying most people don't like the world because it feels lifeless. Please get some glasses.
---
Oh that makes more sense haha. Thank you
---
0 for 3!
---
I will absolutely *die* if I dont get that fishbowl lampshade immediately
---
There are a few things you can buy from the Atomic Shop using Atoms, earned through gameplay challenges and by spending real world money, which affect your gameplay. A short list:
---
\- Repair Kits: Let you repair items without going to a workbench. Convenient but you can also farm better versions of these by killing the Scorchbeast Queen, which is one of the few endgame activities to do anyway.
---
\- Scrap Kits: Scraps junk in your inventory and transfers it to your stash without being at a workbench or stash box. Convenient as well, but you can find workbenches in so many locations and you can increase your carry weight and reduce the weight of Junk through armor pieces and Perk card swaps.
---
\- Scrap Collector Protectron: Can be placed in your CAMP or at a workshop, works kind of like a Resource Harvester. Problem is the Junk and Scrap it gets is random whereas a harvester gets the resource you want, and scrap collecting is really, really easy as it is (see: the existence/benefit of Scrap Kits). I bought the Protectron with challenge-earned Atoms (i.e. "free") because he's funny and makes my CAMP feel less lonely.
---
\- Refrigerator: Keeps food from spoiling for longer. Useful if you need Prime Meat, Raw Flux, and some other stuff to last a bit longer. But they did reduce food/drink spoilage rate substantially a few months ago, you can always put on Good with Salt to reduce the rate further, and IMO unless you are a food-based combat build you might not be running around with so much food/drink for this to really help.
---
These benefits from the Atom Shop can improve your gameplay, but you aren't necessarily doing more damage, surviving for longer, or otherwise achieving something that someone else can't with 5-10% more ingenuity or effort.
---
However, my interpretation is less that these specific items are the problem but that they put us on a slippery slope. The Repair Kit was added a long time ago, and for a long time it was the only "pay-to-win" item. Then came Scrap Kits in the middle of the summer, and very soon afterwards the robot and fridge in the same patch. The concern is that more of this stuff is coming and much more frequently, and once they run out of small "convenient" features they may start introducing actual game-changing items.
---
It's up to you to decide whether the game as it is today with its microtransactions is "unenjoyable" and whether the game as it will be in six to twelve months with its new versions of these "convenient" / "pay to win" microtransactions is or remains "unenjoyable." I'm personally keeping an eye out but I am not concerned just yet. That said, I am willing to admit being wrong when the time comes.
---
Question. Do you know how you even cash in script from meat week? Or how you even check to see what you got by cashing in your prime meats? I've been gone awhile because I was waiting for improvements...I'm glad I didnt hold my breath. Lol
---
Oh this makes more sense. But also the new skin isn't necessarily better. Some people like a clean house look, but I understand this controversy now. So I appreciate that
---
Currently the mutations I have are: Bird Bones, Marsupial, Adrenal Reaction, Healing Factor, Grounded, Twisted Muscles, Plague Walker, Electrically Charged, Unstable Isotope.
---
I do have class freak on but curious if I am killing myself looking at the negative effects of Plague Walker, Electrically Charged, and Unstable Isotope...
---
Said the level 700..I'm getting laid. Have fun playing with your controller cus that's all you'll ever play with. Bitch.
---
I don't think so. I have 75 of the damned things and when the quest rarely ever shows up it only takes one of them.
---
Um sorry but it actually reflects light and makes your camp more noticeable so clearly p2w
---
ü§£
---
Have players start a new character only! No back and forth between modes, so a survival only character. 
---
This way survival actually means the player must survive in survival mode without the ability to run away to lick their wounds in adventure mode... 
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs harsh but it‚Äôs the truth... it was never ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù. 
---
Their first mistake was letting players transfer between modes and bring equipment into the new server... 
---
Keep in mind this was all at the height of duper‚Äôs duping everything so Bethesda letting players switch back and forth allowed the transfer of duped items. 
---
It was a kill em‚Äô all mode... that‚Äôs it. There was no survival at all.
---
You know what would be cooler? Grab abunch of friends and have them move their camps close to each other with an artillery. That way, you can have a sensation of cannon fire as you march down.
---
Of course! But for future reference, I am a girl! (No biggie on the man though, I do that too! :) )
---
Bracers/Shocks/Targeting HUD are a given
---
I've actually been finding a great deal of success with Kinetic Dynamo on the chest when paired with Dodgy and Action Boy. In essence I have a permanent 30% damage reduction since my AP regenerates so quickly (no AP spent on VATS with big guns) that allows me to operate at higher health.
---
Given how big guns self-root you and how Patch 12 grossly overpowered poison attacks from Mirelurks, Bloodbugs, Stingwings, etc, I can't feel comfortable running a &lt;20% Bloodied build, especially since I can't Stimpak until my gatling laser/plasma are done spinning down. But at 45-50% Bloodied I have a larger buffer and can output more damage over time without worrying about being killed.
---
I'd love more extreme weather, too!
---
Anyone remember the weather cheat codes from GTA?
---
I strongly advise you to look up the definition of the word "necessary."
---
I agree with you dude. I find alot of the game has wasted empty space and its rather boring. The game has a weather system but it affects nothing really (wooo a few rads once in a while). They have this awesome huge sandbox but its filled with just a few turds.
---
This is Grafton's Mayor! I need you to get those soldiers remains to the Philipi Battlefield Cemetery.
---
I know, but it seems like the run to you faster the longer you drum.
---
I just bought a brand new pc and a 24" curved monitor. Nothing too fancy but it can run FO76 on Ultra at 60 FPS stable almost anywhere.
---
Now, after being forced to playe since B.E.T.A. on a relatively old laptop, for me it was like playing a completely different game ahah.
---
I have been wandering around Flatwoods just looking at the scenery and the godrays!
---
I dunno all them big words that where used prior...
---
But chea,it ain‚Äôt even pay too win,like at all...
---
In fact,if you enjoy playin it,It pays you,
---
wit relaxation,
---
maybe ya meet a friend,so it pays you In companionship,(In Game).
---
Maybe outfit game,who‚Äôs too say?
---
But otherwise,plug In play.
---
Ya might just enjoy yerself...
---
&amp; Welcome too Appalachia
---
They ain‚Äôt all as Redneck as me,but they‚Äôre good people.
---
You can get regenerating armour. Theres also perks where your rads heal in the day time, and theres a perk where radiation heels you.
---
It shouldn't be that surprising since it literally says "75% chance to reduce damage by 15% while **standing** still"
---
Ahh! So what you‚Äôre saying is the diamond to the door has nothing to do with my current quest. I‚Äôll have to look into that. Thanks for the info.
---
I‚Äôve never run into anyone role playing, let alone groups of people. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre out there, but it doesn‚Äôt seem common. Maybe in survival mode where there‚Äôs PVP? But then it talks about bounties....yeah, I‚Äôm confused.
---
My instigating gauss an dragon work just fine.
---
Skins dont effect game mechanics.  It isnt play to win.
---
Can't wait to use my Gamma gun collection.
---
Hahahaha hahahaha hahahaha üòòüòòüòò
---
When did Beth announce that NPC are actually wearing functional armor?
---
With the low amount of lights we're allowed it may as well be necessary
---
Ummm u/Flooping_Pigs is just joking. The flooring is nice, though.
---
It works well for me. Very few issues if any. Is that not up to your standards? Would you like me to check in with you before I create my next post?
---
Congratulation, you found the old instigating bug.
---
But the weapon into your stash, relog and re-equip it. That should fix it.
---
Here's another one idea. The ability to build a campfire not in your camp that disappears shortly after. It's just wood and a flip lighter.
---
If you actually look at the community, you'll see the majority does give Bethesda credit and praise.  r/fo76/ has 205,539 subscribers as of this post.  That's more than 3's and New Vegas's combined, a stone toss away from 4's, and about a third of the main Fallout subreddit.  For a game a lot of clickbaited and haters say is a failure, those are some telling numbers.
---
Just for the record, only a dozen or so people were affected by the moldy helmets.  There was a lot of misinformation spread about that whole thing.  As JuiceHead's video pointed out, a lot of it is done purposely because there's a small vocal group of Fallout who hate Bethesda and everything they do so they spread disinformation and lies.  Either out of fanboyism for Obsidian and New Vegas like the No Mutants Allowed community, or out of clickbait and monetization reasons like YongYea and ManyATrueNerd.  Negative voices will always sound louder than the positive ones.  We saw this when some people turned on Josh Sawyer when he praised Fallout 4 as being way more immersive and a great direction for the franchise.
---
I'd say try to ignore the negativity, especially when a lot of it comes from people who don't seem to actually play or have any interest in the game.
---
It‚Äôs an exasperating system. I have a 500GB drive which, ironically is fine for game space, but makes the double size updates a constant headache.
---
Does it though?
---
Because it's fucking dropdead boring, this game will never even be half the game New Vegas was.
---
They should have lighting strikes that deal damage and have random tornadoes that destroy camps depending how severe the tornado is. Also the tornados could produce hail that does camp/player/enemy damage as well.
---
Video games are serious business.
---
Pardon me, but how do I " click "!analyze -v" in the text pane on the  right"? I seem to be missing that particular "button" and I can't type in the command window.
---
Oh and they can add a random tsunami that hits along side the bigger water edges for all those players that like to stash there camp on near the junk spot by Meadows Farm
---
Why did our comments get deleted??
---
There‚Äôs other events going on. Just gotta look for em
---
 There are no necessary Atom shop items.
---
You do not need to use the Atom Shop unless you want your hunting rifle or power armor to look different.
---
You do not need a fridge, you do not need a collector bot.  They dont do much for you anyway.  
---
The fridge and collector bot are the only 2 things that impact gameplay, and its a minimal impact if any.  The collector doesnt really stack up the hard to get junk items, basically he gives you 13 steel or plastic an hour, which is one laser rifle scrapped with scrapper on.
---
Atoms can be gained in game by completing daily/weekly/character/combat/survival/ect achievements.
---
You should be able to get enough atoms to buy both the fridge and collector within the first few weeks of play.  If you spent them on fashion and skins, then thats on you.  Grind out some more dailies and weeklys and get some more atoms.
---
The Atom shop is for the fashionista, if you live to collect all plans and items for your camp, then you may feel like the atom shop makes this PTW, but its not.  What you get there doesnt change gameplay in the slightest.  There is nothing in the shop that impacts combat, questing or progression.
---
Don't worry friend, when something hits the bottom line, the only thing that lefts is to go up.
---
Yup - this game never needed NPC's and the original design philosophy was off the chain. Very few games have accomplished what this one managed to pull off.
---
Definitely not. Lol
---
‚ÄúRelatively small group‚Äù
---
Translation- not you.
---
I hear ya i mean i get the primal notifacation but not meat week so i got to alwase keep checking the map to see if its going on. Quite annoying.
---
it looks awesome sitting next to Frog Habitat.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm guilty of floating camps in Fo76, but in Fo4.. yeah most definitely, there was a whole lotta floating going on. However, I‚Äôve been really bored with the boxy-regular-house looking camps I always ended up building and tried to break out of my comfort zone. So a few months ago I built myself a treehouse, still a little boxy, but I love it! And your camp is awesome! More unique camps for the people!
---
Yup. But hey, lemme waste a core on these squirrels.
---
A year is long enough for obsidian to make an entire fallout world but not long enough for them to fix a single bug? It's a matter of priority at this point.
---
Whoa you sound like someone who probably sends death threats
---
Cause you know everything right?
---
Can confirm, killed a Scorched Megasloth out in the wild and it did not count towards the weekly...sadness!!!
---
I'm sorry that OP is such a fucking asshole, man. Happy birthday. And happy spookyday!
---
How the hell is a re-enactment of real life events in history a "trigger"?
---
I use to just do a circuit to collect scrap, caps and sell able items from legendaries. Had to go to a certain place I hadn't been to in a while and noticed it had changed. Started re-exploring the map and found a few more. Most notably the airport. Now once a month I go all over the map just looking around
---
*Hell yeah brother*
---
Thanks! I took hours search the internet our unique camp locations and surprising there were only a few. Pretty pumped to see more camps built into the environment.
---
I've always loved the idea of the **Uplifted Deathclaws** from Vault 13, and I would *love* to see more of those crazy critters in a future Fallout game.
---
Likewise, the **Ghouls of Gecko** were a wonderful little group of outcasts that have the potential for a lot of intriguing story seeds, especially if we assume that they were put on even footing with Vault City.
---
Lol I don't care what some lame-o taking shit way too seriously on the internet says. But thanks! Happy spooky day to you too!
---
Survival is only gone till after wastelanders drops then everything will go bk to normal.
---
The only things in the Atomic Shop that are controversial are simply just items that are for the ‚Äúlazy‚Äù or can‚Äôt be bothered to do. 
---
The most common thing thrown around when it comes to repair kits, scrap kits, collectron, is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time to do that‚Äù. Tbh if you can spent 5 minutes clearing a location for scrap. Then Maybe survival-like games aren‚Äôt your type. 
---
I get some people have lives to live and many have children/jobs. 
---
In a nice way it‚Äôs good to see that there are ways to still allow others to play what they love. But at the same time your paying 50-700 atoms for a slightly easier gaming experience.
---
I guess I never considered whether or not I was upright. Regardless, good to know!
---
IKR, I literally JUST bought the standard version like 3 days ago
---
Always on the hour if you were wondering

There isnt a single thing in the atom shop necessary to complete or have fun with the game.  You can farm for atoms ingame anyway.  Idk whats the point of being given the option to farm ingame for atoms if people are still gonna complain or cry pay to win.  Whatever comments about what makes the game fun or not fun is just from their perspective.  Ive had fun in games where people have cried pay to win.  Youll never know how much fun you'll have based on biased oponions.  Personally, I have yet to see any items in item mall that prevents any type of progression or fun for not having it.  I can understand if you dont find the game itself fun, but saying the game isnt because one does not want to spend time farming atoms or paying cash doesnt make it so.  Some people comelained about repair kits but I haven't seen any probs with them.  Ive had spare atoms and bought some because I was an idiot and didnt see they just moved the option to repair wothr ingame mats.  I have not used a repair kits since, but still have no issue with people using them.  As long as it doesnt effect my personal gameplay directly, like literally preventing me from playing/progressing, then idc and that hasnt happened yet.  My toon is like lv100.  I haven't played in a while because I've already exhausted my enjoyment with what they currently have and just waiting and looking forward the next major content(s).
---
Altho I do agree it is kind of a slap to the face when people have been asking for a fridge type storage to be part of the game and then do it but put it in the item mall.  Eveb then its nothing really major.  I never bought it, and I dont hae that backpack mod to slow down food spoilage nor do I have that perk card.  This isnt even a hardcore survival game and im bad at any, yet u have no probs here, they even extended perishables lifespan.  Just plant and grow shit and store up w.e perm food I can find til I need them.  If u r desperate, switch in cannibal every now and then til I can find food.
---
It's one thing to make paid content to pay the debts and fund more content. Its another to have 90% of all new content to be microtransactions. If that was the problem then they should have just let us buy nice big dlcs that were actually good and full of content.
---
Well maybe the free stuff.
---
Lucky Hole is pretty good. You might have to server hop a few times to get ants, though. (One of the things I liked Survival mode for was when I was doing quick server hopping like that from Adventure mode I would definitely not rejoin the same server)
---
I know lol i was at the first one months bk
---
The cheapest i could find was $10. Where did you buy with $1 ?
---
This is a fantastic response. Kudos to you!
---
Yeah lol, bought a AA SS at around lvl 150 cause i hadn't gotten anything cool in those hours. A day or two later AA SS +agl with much better dura dropped at westtek
---
I suspect the biggest problem here is technical.
---
What you're doing is called being willfully ignorant of the point being made.
---
Yeah, don't use the fo76 map as a real map üòÑ
---
What is cavalier meant for? Is it more to the defensive or offensive side of a fight? Cavalier may be to close in on the enemy which is not necessary for ranged fights. Only for melee based fights to close in without getting much damage? In ranged it seems like running away but I‚Äôm bloodied and dying is to me part of the package.
---
I wander myself. Put on some music and a YouTube video like fo4 no damage runs and just zone out. Its honestly therapeutic üòÇ
---
Sadly :(
---
But still workshop PvP!
---
Well I don't think it will be exactly a month but I do hope that it is sometime next month.
---
If my Memory serves me right it does not realy have any Advantage over the normal syringer. If you are on PC pm me and i can craft you a bleedout-Syringer or an Rad-Scorpion-Syringer.  I would Need 10 rad-scorpion-Stingers for the later though.
---
Why does it work well for you? Can you actually explain your thought or reasoning to anything that you've claimed deserves praise, or are you too busy being a passive aggressive dick to anyone who doesn't agree with you?  
---
and with how low effort and quality this post is. Yes I would appreciate it if you could hit me up with a draft before you put this garbage in public. A majority of the people here think you are talking about the setting of the world rather than the multiplayer aspects and, how they relate to gameplay mechanics, and that's because of the simple fact that you are horrible at getting your point across, and expressing your thoughts or opinions. I'd gladly help you in the future :D
---
I literally just stated facts. If entire games can be made in a year then a single bug can be fixed in less time. Only logical conclusion is that its not a priority. You seem like a Bethesda apologist whi thinks they can do mo wrong.
---
Lol no
---
Many people who traditionally praised them for these sort of things didn't even buy or play this game out of principle.
---
I would liked to have team up more in survival. It seems that everyone just wanted to kill you each time I played it.
---
Fire breathers. Assuming some time paradox is in affect. The FB are still humans with morals. Better trained and armed. Hell they have gear meant to resist fire.
---
The Forged are just petty raiders with a fire fetish.
---
There's other inaccuracies too. The pumpkin house in real life is near Camden park.
---
Cool idea! I think it would make pricing consistent maybe and more people would travel to it since they‚Äôre all close by! 
---
Nice!
---
That's the opposite side of the map! Huh
---
The barbecue keeps glitching on me I don't get any rewards even if we win the event
---
If you're not interested in trading with other players, junking legendaries for scrip and then hitting up the purveyor is your best bet. Go for two star ranged legendaries, don't waste your scrip on three stars unless you already have the perfect two star.
---
Amen!
---
Don‚Äôt buy this. I made the mistake since it said armored I had to check it out. Well it‚Äôs not and your ears show through the head cover.  It‚Äôs terrible.
---
I'll upvote this every time it gets suggested.  Been a need since day one.
---
And it‚Äôll keep getting worse. We bitched about the fridge but no one wanted to listen. Now comes the snowball effect
---
Considering that other helmets in game don't I would say no. That could be seen as pay to win because you would be buying addition armor that isn't available in any other way.
---
River Gorge Bridge actually has water under it...
---
Uh well I haven‚Äôt actually used one but on the wiki it says it‚Äôs just a normal firework that will go off it doesn‚Äôt do damage or anything like that
---
nice man thanks for the tip.
---
Cooking at a buildable camp fire would be great.
---
Good idea if no one buys mine I might do this c:
---
I feel ya. Browse vendors or even the market here on Reddit. Even scrip ages useless weapons and armour. In hopes for a better rng roll. I‚Äôve found that most of my good gear when I was partied with someone.
---
How long has it been? I actually put mine up for 1k as well:
---
I wonder if developers kids are told they have to wear helmets when on bikes or skateboards since ones in Fallout offer no protection...lol
---
Agree with everything here. If it wasn‚Äôt for a couple of friends I knew outside of this game I wouldn‚Äôt have played this the same way I played other fallouts, solo. The whole trading was a pain in the ass to the point friends and I would just drop stuff to give to one another(I‚Äôm not even gonna get into that perk card sharing garbage)Personally it should have been a 4 player borderlands style co-op.
---
That would be pay to win 100%. They tested the waters with the Invader but that's just a crappy 1h melee weapon. With an additional piece of clothing that adds DR it allows a person to pay for an actual advantage over somebody who didnt pay, even though the perks, gear, and everything else is the exact same.
---
Yeah, I haven't even bothered with whatever that smaller backpack is since I had completed the Tadpole line and can have the full one.  Where exactly is that small plan or bag?
---
Couriers.  Friends.  FACTION.
---
.....uggggh
---
Why of all things did they make a male and female version
---
Yes, you can get some rare  and common plans as well for digging map spots. You get a lot weapons and armor you can scrap also, I've gotten pretty lucky learning mods this way. You don't get experience for digging spots, at least it doesn't pop on the screen (if it happens in the background, someone please correct me).
---
There's so much broken, so much needing deployed, this game does not NEED fishing.  It needs a developer that actually completes the regular product before adding niceties like fishing.
---
If you're still doing this... I have a plan problem ü•∫
---
Previous meat week I seemed to get better rewards, this time people are barely filling the meter and I‚Äôm not getting anything special. Last time I got several legendary items, this time only ones from legendary prime creatures, and they‚Äôre rare.
---
What about the pink unicorn wallpaper? After purchasing this my character become way more powerful than before
---
Bethesda told us this game would have (Free Content) Well for them to give us the content "FREE" there needs to be something that makes them money (ATOM SHOP) there is no Pay to Win elements in there what so ever.
---
I bet you're fun at parties, Captain Hyper-Literal
---
You want it now...
---
So, you don't even want a rushed solution. You want an incomplete, non-working product, or you possibly think they are secretly sitting on a lamp with a genie and can just wish for it to be done immediately magically without any production time.
---
Right. We are done here.
---
It did in game. After David Thorpe of the raiders blew up the dam it‚Äôs likely flooded and drained the valley. The map shows waters but clearly by the time we show up it‚Äôs gone.
---
www.swglegends.com
---
Same here on PC; nuked for this very reason and got clean kills for one Scorched Wendigo and one Scorched Snallygaster at least.
---
I‚Äôve been harping about buffing throwing weapons. Seems like people don‚Äôt share that level of change.
---
Without a doubt the 3D graphics world created by the artists are top-notch, it's the management overall that's the kick in the nutz.
---
I think the only ones that were removed from the rotation were the Horde events.
---
They redid it
---
They redid it a while ago yeah
---
I‚Äôm pretty agitated. It was like, here‚Äôs some tire walls, neat! Oh...the single tires are sold separately...okay. Now there‚Äôs more! Identical tires but with barbed wire...sold separately...okay. 
---
Now red! 
---
Sold. Fucking. Separately. 
---
Bethesda should *take a shit in their hand and squeeze it reeeaallll hard.*
---
Mire needs more lighting!!! Lol
---
If you go under it then it's pretty obvious there was considering how many ships are just lying around
---
Absolutely. Now that I think about it it lags for quite a lot of things. 2 full seconds when PA is recalled, entering and exiting PA and just general lag. I think I just got used to it. 
---
Go back and play Fallout 4 and see how silly smooth it is. You actually exit PA immediately and it looks normal
---
4 player co-op is what this should have been. Borderlands style.
---
It would be nice but the game barely holds itself together without crashing. It is best to just focus on fixing bugs and improving performance and server stability. After this, they can do whatever they want. Do an actual nuclear winter is a good idea too.
---
The backwoods bungalow. Its pretty cool except you have to mat a few things to place them inside.
---
Idk man, but I feel ya. I‚Äôm level 185 and I bought my best gun from another players vending machine.. and it isn‚Äôt even that great compared to what others my level seem to have.
---
Those last 3 I don't use - seems like a great way to piss off the Whitesprings robots and other stuff accidentally.
---
I'm super excited! Hopefully we get a Halloween event before then though üëÄüëÄüëÄ
---
Usually, for bloodied commando, the cav armor is for running away, though I suppose it also works if you're sprinting to reposition to be better firing position.
---
Probably more like 2 months and if there are no hold ups which there probably will be.
---
Agreed, Dynamo/Dodgy/Action Boy good tank combo.
---
all ESO storage is shared between characters
---
I agree they do not get proper credit. I just started playing maybe a month ago now and I was worried about wasting my money but so far I have enjoyed it. Now I still prefer single player because its no where near as good as Skyrim or Fallout 4. But that is because of lack of NPC's. If they can add some NPC's to the game other than robots, it would really improve the Fallout 76 world. I am very picky and find 90% of games to be crap that I do not enjoy. Fallout 76 got trashed and I think its pretty fun to play and I am more of a loner type that does not play or group with others much unless I have too. The bag and the hemlmets are more of a Quality control thing, they need to improve the quality of a product when you sell it or give it as a free item when buying the game. Its a separate issue from the game itself.
---
Update:. We added fishing, quests involving rare fish, and fish mounts!
---
Forum posts:
---
- I equipped a fishing rod and all my weapons disappeared.
---
- Help! Game crashes during fishing minigame.
---
- Radworms does not help with fishing.
---
- Fishing dupe found, 8000 Gatorsalmon for sale.
---
- 17 new bugs introduced with fishing update, 18 old bugs revived.
---
- My legendary fishing rod has ghoul Slayer, please help.
---
- Fish mounts are atom shop only, 800 atoms a piece!  Wtf?
---
Sure will!
---
God I hope not lol
---
I don't have as many as you but my income exceeds my usage by a decent amount.  I have 4 characters so it helps to spread the load :P  
---
I wind up dropping them from time to time as the weight adds up, my goal is maybe 20-30 per character as that seems more than sufficient.  
---
Haven't used a workbench to repair anything in months and probably never will again unless I make another alt.
---
Not that I know of. For a lot of the automatic pistols and rifles, -25% AP costs is pretty top tier as when combined with all the other AP reduction weapon attachments, your AP cost per bullet is almost completely eliminated. If I fire a single bullet and check my pipboy really quick, it says I only used 1 AP. There is a chance it costs me nothing to fire my weapons in vats and that 1 AP is just the natural AP drain from staying activated, but I dunno for sure.
---
Yeah I used to be alright with some of the things they were doing in the shop. The prices were high but they weren't doing that much shady stuff. They were just over pricing items. But now that they just reskin everything an slowly release them it's just shitty business tactics. I thought they wanted people to spend atoms an money. Releasing the same items over an over isnt the way to do it. We've litterally had a new set of tires every week for over a month..
---
Where can you get the extra claw mod plan?
---
Just tell us then
---
Yet it works while jumping and that is not **standing** or **still**, so it literally doesn't behave the way it is literally written, literally...
---
True but I think the other helmets should too, originally when the marine armour helmets circulated they had DMG resistance but a few updates ago that was removed
---
I‚Äôd give Ash Heap credit for originately for the thick smog, still-running mining machines, blackened ground and still-raging fires. It‚Äôs like hell on earth, much worse than FO3‚Äôs desert-like emptiness
---
Every item added thus far is (COSMEDIC) Pay to win is like a weapon or armor peice that has a huge power scale that on one can get except thoes who Pay.
---
Human slavery comes to mind. Family members killing family members over such a thing also has a bad feeling towards it.
---
However, I think this game could seriously benefit from private servers for people to mod the hell out of it. I don't think that's a thing for this game...yet. custom civil war mod on nuclear winter is something I would like too, but  I also wanna try knife fighting in power armor, or everyone having fat mans and missile launchers.
---
There is nothing P2W about the game.
---
"why aren't there as many players on monday morning as on saturday night?"
---
True I think DR should be added to other headwear too originally when the marine armour helmets circulated they had DR so I thought they must have had plans to implement it but they removed that a few updates ago
---
No thank you. I don't want ESO plus.
---
I agree, 4 was definitely more diverse and colorful than 3 by a long shot, but then 76 blew it out of the water. All I mean is that comparitively speaking, 4 has almost a bare minimum level of diversity- but ALSO to be fair, I think 4 encompasses a smaller area than 76, since 76 covers literally the entire state of WV.
---
This one is very debatable. We believe it is bugged. Supposed to drop from deathclaws if you have learnt the DCG plan. I have never seen concrete evidence of it existing. It can be hard to prove since people often have a mod box in their inventory/stash so think they can craft.
---
I hated survival, but as we say in Sweden, opinions are like an ass - divided. Sorry for your loss!
---
Sneak + instigating handmade, nothing survives 2 shots unless I'm in danger.  But then I've got a quad explosive to get me out of tight spots like that ;-)
---
Sad thing is, I'm still shopping for my 'perfect' handmade.  But there's no rush really.
---
Halloween event is a must. Maybe they'll do fashnact again with new masks maybe?
---
No it happens most of the time for me. It sucks because there could be a lot more variety with high burst damage guns switching back and forth.
---
That sounds nice.
---
Yes RW pricing 120 items takes long that I‚Äôd like to do every time  I shut them down.
---
They said they're targeting November but honestly I wouldn't be mad if it was December. Put it out when it's ready so these YouTubers can't pick it apart üòÇ
---
fuck that noise...
---
Ah I didn‚Äôt think of repositioning. I guess that‚Äôs more sniper like though. Get spotted and get outta dodge. Commando goes straight for action.
---
It did, but that only further adds to my point, as New Vegas was done by Obsidian and not Bethesda.
---
I agree it has to be different from ESO plus or Runescape membership but the quality of the atomic shop/the price is ridiculous.
---
It was my local digital marketplace, so no idea if you'll be able to actually buy anything there, but [here](https://funpay.ru/).
---
Faction PvP would be EXCELLENT.
---
I‚Äôm keeping myself entertained with a wanted bounty :)
---
No, there is already another legendary effect that gives bonus against humans, currently unique to the Meteoric Sword. Assassins is a different ability and is against players only.
---
You're smoking crack if you think this game has more building options and assets than FO4. :P  
---
Costumes, yea 76 has more, but I counted cosmetics altogether and frankly outfits have less meaning than building because there's virtually no customization involved.
---
As far as story, hard disagree. I'm not one of the people who would argue that 76 has no story, it certainly does, but it's more episodic and extremely shallow in many cases. Not necessarily bad, but the main story of FO4 alone has more meat to it than the entirety of 76.
---
I also don't agree that 76 has become better over time. I think that was true the first few months after launch, but the summer has been a void of meaningful updates, with plenty of reintroduced problems and persistent bugs and disappointments like the near reward-less meat weak and the sadness that turned out to be 76's 'dungeons' and 'raids'. Honestly the atom shop updates more than any other single thing in this game, by a long shot, and it's not even a F2P game. That says a lot about what's happening at Bethesda concerning this game.
---
Overall the world is great, I agree. But that doesn't mean much at this point. I stand by my argument that it's a wonderful foundation that's being underserved by Bethesda and whatever problems the devs are dealing with in terms of management, creativity, tech restrictions, etc.
---
I care that survival is gone. The asshole containment beta was a great idea.
---
No perks or anything for throwing weapons, its almost sad.
---
They used too though or at least the marine armour helmets did when they first circulated
---
I'd love to see more weather patterns
---
welcome back
---
I agree with you on the cylindrical shape of the building area, which is why I have not been able to replicate it. It was a theory that is not my own. The only reason I mentioned it is that in certain builds, I have reached the end of my build area (where I could not build anymore) and then built up and was able to build out slightly from a higher level. However, it's not by much.
---
In the most recent build video, it has not been attacked. It is built partially up the north face of the northern Seneca Rock mountain. I have seen Cargobots flying around, but they do not attack unprovoked. I have also built on top of both mountain peaks at Seneca Rock, and have never been attacked there. I have rarely seen Scorchbeasts there, but they fly below the peaks, never above. At least in my experience. 
---
There is a way to get to this C.A.M.P. but it's an endeavor. You have to go up the south slope of the southern peak. Jump from the south peak to the north peak, and then scale down the north face of that mountain. When you fast travel, you would travel north from the Observatory, and you can get there in about 5-8 minutes if you know what you're doing. I called it inaccessible because you can't realistically get to it without mutations and knowledge of climbing those mountains.
---
We get fire in the hole and bloody mess. And sneak hits seem to work last I used them.
---
&gt; instead of going seal clubbing at workshops in Adventure
---
I'm basically going to that because of the removal of survival
---
what is a god roll to you might not be a god roll to me..
---
the fog in the swamps.  upgraded from a gtx 1050ti to a rtx 2060super and it truly is a different game.  good hunting and gratz
---
Unloaded with tse then prime gauss last night for a few minutes, then worked on minions. Worked out well
---
I guess. It takes me less then 5 min. But I see your point.
---
Mainly, it's not a persistent online universe. Nothing I do is persistent. Kill a Mob? Respawn. Take a workshop? Whatever. Do a quest/event? Who cares. Fight a player? You'll never see him again.
---
The whole world is destroyed by the inconsistency of the server you connect to. 
---
That, and there's no point building if I can't build near to my pal/near to existing locations.
---
Ho and the many many many issues you've easily dismissed are what prevent me from enjoying that "open world".
---
Also you can get improved repair kits from killing the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
is this Kevduit?
---
I agree, but I think it‚Äôs going to get better with wastelanders, I like the voices of human npcs, more than holotapes in fallout games.
---
Hmm. LIKE A BE+R Fixer or a B+FFR+R?
---
Wasnt the plasma caster in an older fallout game
---
Right... like the OP said real life... that‚Äôs why I mentioned the water, there are similar places but not exact.
---
I dont mind survival pve. I dont survival pvp. If they made a survival pve mode with one mode for pvp and one for no pvp I would do it. But ultimately, I  play fallout for pvp. It's cool if you like it, but it aint for me
---
So there are People who still want to spend more money on this game after almost one year of pretty much no real content besides Atom Shop Cash Grabs. Interesting how people still think that this game is still in hardcore development. There are probably only one coder and designer left in this dev team and they are earning tons of money from this whales right now lol.
---
Xblocks or Plaguestation?
---
Fallout 76 receives much justified and overblown criticism. But first some context.
---
1: Previously, Bethesda games have been entirely offline single player experiences with no in game micro transactions. The sudden shock of going from Fallout 4 to Fallout 76 was always going to be unpopular for many, including myself. 
---
2: Fallout 76 made no noticeable leaps in graphics, bug fixes, or weapon handling. Fallout 4 by now has a plethora of mods which improve the experience. IMO Fallout 76 should have been a fallout 4 DLC.
---
3: the release state of 76 is inexcusable. Way too many issues, the release should have been pushed back by 6 months.
---
Fallout 76 comes off as a micro transaction asset flip. I enjoy the game and love the map, but the game has so much negativity around it I don‚Äôt think the world will get the appreciation it deserves.
---
Nice! I‚Äôve been trying to do every event in the Ash heap that I can... one day it might drop!...lol
---
Todd will monetize this.
---
Thank for confirming this. I did try a new character earlier and it did seem a bit smoother but maybe because his inventory isn't as packed as my main hauler guy lol
---
Speaking of the fridge. What can they hold? Stacks or was it like 15 single items?
---
you are also missing the wendigo. you can get the quest by picking up the note at the hotel you see the broken robot for the explosives daily. free range in the mire also starts there. by the broken robot, there are a few tables with umbrellas. there's a note on the table which should start the quest. if you did this already, nevermind. the mount isn't on your list.
---
you have a point there.  stop poking the stabby guy cause he's in our neighborhood now.  good luck to you sir
---
Generally I say no. People tend to have most items. Frankly at your level I would say your better off selling to vendors. 
---
There are some items that you'll discover are semi-valuable. Like I sell plans mostly to get rid of them, ie, I came across a handmade rifle plan. I had a legendary and nee the mods I wanted so I sold it. I got more than the default price was but I knew I had to undercut the vendors price.
---
I love Handmades. I have three and I'm still trying to find the perfect one as well.
---
Free States &amp; Responders in 76
---
Atom Cats, Railroad, &amp; Minutemen in 4. (Not Preston though. I liked him until he betrayed me because I accidentally stole the land from one of my settlements. I asked them nicely to leave.)
---
Thanks for taking the time to confirm this! I also got use to it but coming back after a break and playing other games it was more noticeable. 
---
I have all the same stutters you mention also. I presumed it would have been fixed by now considering they improved things for nuclear winter.
---
It changes every time you hop servers or if you store and replace it.
---
One of my team mates bought it and it is crap. Power connectors don't attach to the roof and you have to rug glitch for most of the work benches. He regrets buying it.
---
Store it an place it again.
---
No one can handle ultra graphic at 60 fps not even a 2080 super rtx and a oc processor can handle a rock solid 60 fps in most situations, the main problem of this game is the fact that ultra and high settings are just for tests and screenshots, the frame rate on these one's is unstable ,that's a problem with an old graphic engine. Ofc yes the game itself on these settings is wonderful but unplayable at 60 fps for the 99% of the players. Using a rtx 2060 oc and i5 6600k oc 4,3. That's make me sad every time, changed a gtx 1070 to a rtx 2060 to play from low to medium.
---
I get what you mean. 
---
I feel the same way regarding the current 800lb stash space. I‚Äôve come into the habit of using alts to store excess weapons, junk, aid. 
---
Doing this has made the game more fun for me. It gives me more to do. But I feel weird about it. 
---
I want Bethesda to actually state what the ‚Äúintended‚Äù stash limit SHOULD be regardless of tech limitations. 
---
The most intense challenge I‚Äôve faced in 76 was when I Camped as close as I could to a fissure site (in Survival Mode sometimes). The Scorchbeast will spawn literally every 5-10 minutes if you live close enough. I‚Äôve done this several times but found I couldn‚Äôt keep up with resources. 
---
Now, would you consider this part of the game like what your saying with intentionally making the game challenging? I wouldn‚Äôt. It might not be a ‚Äúquest‚Äù to camp on top of a scorched site, but it‚Äôs still as real as any other objective I‚Äôve done in the game.
---
Well, from what I‚Äôve learned today from Bungies ShadowKeep launch, people just enjoy complaining and will always find some reason to hate something beautiful.
---
I‚Äôm just cringing at the amount of lag that would produce lmao
---
Yes but it, alongside the Heavy Incinerator and the Hellfire Armor, were CC content in 4. Hence why I have them as examples (except for the Incinerator since we don't have that yet)
---
I've always felt that Bethesda is really good at both worldbuilding and environmental storytelling, and 76 is no exception to this. The problem I feel that arises with 76 is what they do with the world they built. 
---
For the first few months I played after launch, I was doing what I always do in any new RPG: exploring, doing all of the quests, all of the events, collecting all of the junk for crafting, and reading every terminal/scrap of paper I could find. 
---
However, after exploring just about everywhere, the gameplay started turning into junk farming simulator, with the added bonuses of plan farming and legendary farming simulator. It's hard to stay immersed in a world where your major goals are to farm junk to make ammo just so you can farm more.
---
Here's hoping that wastelanders adds in enough to help break up the monotony.
---
TL;DR: The world is beautiful, there just isn't much there to keep you engaged in the long run unless you really enjoy wandering around vistas and/or farming.
---
tip if you don't know: super duper is your friend.
---
"Sometimes that Radshark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a Radshark, he‚Äôs got lifeless eyes, glowing eyes, like a Synth‚Äôs eye. When he comes at ya, doesn‚Äôt seem to be livin‚Äô."
---
Lol I love shot post
---
I‚Äôm around that and I‚Äôve only seen 2 of them. You can always tell they‚Äôre coming by that one lightening strike and the wind howl. It makes me nostalgic for some reason, they‚Äôre also much more common in fo4

They certainly exist. The drop rate is just extremely low.

Bethesda? Putting effort into this game? LOL

Can you also tell me if it gives -2 PER or just bonuses?
---
The storms made the games vibe like 500x spookier
---
Battle Bot and Breach and Clear seem to be the ones people get the drops from. I farm them religiously.
---
I have a 144hz and playing with a 72 fps cap and unluckily my eyes catch so much fps drops. That's not mean the game is bad or blablabal just saying my experience
---
So I was the dick, right? I was? I don't care if you disagree.
---
"Why aren't we focused on the nice rims that guy had in the 4 car pile up?"
---
You don‚Äôt want to tell us because Bethesda reads these forums, yet give clues as if Bethesda can‚Äôt assign someone to check the game files and find it. 
---
In fact, I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna do: check the game files. Thanks!
---
I‚Äôll pm it to one of the Bethesda accounts when I find it.
---
Pretty sure I read something about Bethesda using the instancing tech to make areas level differently for each player, and given that Wastelanders will add new quests I can imagine that the "low" level areas will suddenly be more relevant.
---
There should just be an account wide bank that you deposit caps/items too for all of your characters to access. Like want to transfer go to Whitesprings deposit items and caps and then log out main menu show you your account and everything that‚Äôs in the bank.
---
Pissed, why? They _want_ to sell for a loss?
---
Yeah, they showed with the Nuclear Winter scorched lands that they can re-texture if need be, so yeah. It would be very nice with some real winter.
---
This would be the first step into them making something like a donation container where people who like your camp can donate stuff.
---
I actually lucked out and went to my camp before I logged off and found a donation someone left outside my museum. Chems and some beer. Worth a few caps when I sell it, since I don't use chems.
---
What are the best weapon attachments for AP reduction?
---
I wish you could just set the damn color through the console attached to its pod. When I first saw it, I thought it *was* for changing the color but nope.
---
This is about what searches of /r/market76 show them going for as well. You can often 1:1 a red asylum for a decent legacy weapon.
---
Include swords too, and the broadsider.
---
Because locking the most powerful weapons behind a limited-time event would be bad?
---
No matter how much grinding you do after the event, if you didn't get lucky or have the free time to grind at that time, you'll never be as powerful as someone who did manage to get the weapons from luck, and that's BS.
---
I've done that close to 10 times.... I dont think that works...
---
Leaving me with the question, how did someone who wasn‚Äôt a team member take the locks off my doors today looking for my vending machines? I had just turned them off (capped out 30k) and went inside closing my door. He came through a min later and went into my excavator room with a lock on it so I know they had locks on them.
---
I like the idea, I would enjoy more 'ambient gameplay' from some of the Cryptids... Here's hoping in good time!

Its a feature!
---
How about they make it so people can‚Äôt buy guns and armor on eBay and reddit. Make it so you HAVE to put in the time and actually find the gear or roll for it. Make the gear have a trade timer where you only have a small window of time.
---
Whenever it is released I can guarantee you won‚Äôt have enough atoms for it.
---
Individual items... I'm not sure if theres a cap on how many fridges you can build..? But I built 2 just to see if there was a 1 per camp limit.. so you can* at least build 2..
---
Didn't you hear? Wastelanders is an Epic Game Store exclusive now.
---
I'm joking please no karma lynching
---
Ain't that the truth.  I sale with a formula that undervalues things - most items I sale are in the 500 - 1500 range. A hunter's exploding bashing I'd price at around 2000 caps. Sure, an explosive can get more than that if you go on the merchant lists here on reddit and elsewhere, but I consider myself a wholesaler, not a retailer.  I carry around 30 legendaries at any given time and scrip things that don't sale.
---
this is the way.  thank you
---
For a long time I scoffed at, and was irritated by, outfits that can be found in the game that had minor alterated versions sold in the Atom Shop.
---
Then realized only Atom shop outfits can be brought into Nuclear Winter. I grabbed underarmor since the Vault blue is so noticeable.
---
8,000,000 scorch with their playerbase is nothing they definitely mean scorchbeast
---
on my page it says scorched and anything with scorched in the name
---
No it's Scorched. That one's a typo.
---
Given Bethesda‚Äôs track record, I wouldn‚Äôt hold your breath on this being a quality update. At best, I‚Äôd be cautiously optimistic.

Which one?

It says anything scorched, so scorched creatures count as well. Also the population of WV is around 1.8 million as of 2018, so either way dannnnggggg.

Even after the buffs it would still be weaker than the Tomahawk, which is a base game item.

Faster Fire Rate and Faster Swing Speed are tier 2 only, and you missed Faster Reload and 90% Weight Reduction.

That's awesome of you to do. I see them for 100 at the lowest, and usually way more. I love finding vendors that have reasonable prices! I'm working on collecting all the plans for house decor and furniture and some sellers get very exorbitant with prices.

Did they every fix energy weapons? Mini gun spin up? Broken daily quests? I mean, sure, the world was wonderful until all the cracks start to show that they spent months ignoring. I eventually ran out of hope for a lot it things.

---
Having a team went a long way and kept you safe in many situations. My wife and I played together in Survival from the day it started until last night. It was fun while it lasted.
---
For me personally, I don‚Äôt feel like they deserve credit because 76 wasn‚Äôt a fully grown game. That is to say, they took an existing engine and built multiplayer around it, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so buggy and probably explains the very weird storage limitations. If this was a visual effects and multiplayer mod for FO4 made by some dude in his basement, I‚Äôd be impressed. But this is a AAA title from one of the worlds premiere game designers that is inherently broken. That‚Äôs why I personally don‚Äôt give them a lot of kudos.

I mean yea, I'd consider building by a SB nest self-imposed difficulty. But it's not as disruptive to immersion because you're not frequently having to ignore game mechanics or entire objects, like oh I can't loot that because it's X food and I told myself not to. xD
---
Even still, what you did sounds more like a personal challenge than a difficulty overhaul. It's not what I'm after. I want something like Survival mode for FO4 or JSawyer mod for NV-- things that significantly change the difficulty of various aspects of the game, but in harmony. There's a mod for FO4 called Horizon that is the best iteration of this kind of thing I've seen so far. Some things it does include:
---
1. Far less loot in the world (especially food and medicine and ammo), forcing you to make hard gameplay choices to survive and thrive.
---
2. More enemies / tougher enemies (but no bullet sponges), making the world more dangerous.
---
3. More adverse environmental effects. This is a big one, because I felt really disappointed with these things in 76. We need truly bad rad storms and we need them more often, as well as other regional disturbances like dust storms in Ash Heap, toxic sickness in Toxic Valley, droughts in Savage Divide, communicable diseases in The Mire, and maybe mutation-causing pollen from Cranberry Bog. There's so much that could be done with this because Appalachia is such an amazingly crafted world, and yet they've done next to nothing because the base game is intended to be accessible (which was fine at launch).
---
4. Real challenges to unlock camp conveniences that affect survival, like water purifiers, fridges, electricity, etc.
---
This kind of difficulty has a large audience in single player games, but even larger with multiplayer because you're sharing the experience on live servers. A much more difficult game would make almost every social interaction more important, makes economies more interesting, makes success in combat feel like a big victory, and makes finding something in the wastes (and progression in general) much more satisfying. How you spec matters more and this can really promote a strong connection with your character, friends, and the world itself.
---
As it is I was able to get decent challenge from 76 for awhile, but this more epic adventure is what the game needs, both for veterans of high difficulty and more casual players who know the game well now and need new challenges. TBH I'm really surprised Bethesda hasn't produced a new difficulty mode so far... and I largely blame the time they spent on PVP over the last year.
---
Yeah same here. If there's an owned workshop in Adventure, you can bet my wife and I are going to be the raiders we are and kill you and steal your junk every time.

I'm sure they'll find a way to fuck it up

The info is a rare drop from the SBQ, some say it is a wasteland myth.

The only reason I would go back anywhere is if it had higher level enemies

Add fog to the list, I've seen only few and they so pretty! You can barely see anything past 50 feet and its magical, it'd be amazing to fight bunch of mob when you don't know where they're coming from and if VATS cant penetrate through thick fog.

I wanted to love Fallout 76. Heck, I got it for free so I got to enjoy the game without the guilt of spending money. It‚Äôs just hard to enjoy the world when when the core mechanics either don‚Äôt work or are very shallow. I wanted to play a melee build but only every other hit registered, or it would register but then rollback, looting was unsatisfying and slow, for being a multiplayer game it felt like interacting with other players was very limited, no in game text chat, story fell flat, etc. idk I‚Äôm a big fan of Bethesda, I own every Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Doom title but 76 is so bad that I‚Äôd rather have a remaster of any of their previous titles :/
---
They figured how how to make cosmetics pay to win, those dastards!
---
Yeah its the best Bethesda has made, but it doesn't hold up compared to most other open world options available now. There was even several games available the year before 76 launched that really blew the graphics out of the water. Both single player and multi. Its not a terrible game, but definitely a 4/10 belo2 average game in my opinion.
---
Just buy one lmao, how are people this dumb. You can just go to the trading subreddit and bug damn near anything you can also just go onto the xbox lfg and look through all the trade post
---
Exactly.  Maybe thinking about it phrased that way will help the OP.
---
I mean, if I wanted to play devil's advocate, I could come up with a lot of counter-examples, but this exactly.
---
Yes please! Gameplay can be so much deeper with darker nights, heavy weather, thick fog, etc. New perks, gear, mutations can be introduced and existing ones tweaked to cope with challenges weather/darkness brings.
---
I wish I could delete this post.
---
All scorched like scorch (insert tag here) right?
---
Ha lol
---
i would been happy to just "mail" a couple pieces to another toon.
---
I agree and I wish they would add something like Fo4‚Äôs survival mode too. 
---
What you‚Äôre describing, how social interaction would mean more in Survival.. this would be fantastic. Unfortunately, until they find a way to stop cheating/duping for good, this wouldn‚Äôt ever be as ‚Äúreal‚Äù as we‚Äôd want it to be. 
---
I hope a new Survival Mode makes us all start from scratch, eliminates fast travel entirely, and gives us that hardcore feel as you describe
---
I'm sure they would just be massacred by damn near anything
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
You probably need to check this sub, then. It's exactly for people who are here to play the game. More fun, less drama.
---
Yup. More weather, darker nights, etc. Keep things interesting. Even though I can one shot ghouls they'd still freak me out if it was dark. Give us a reason to use the flashlight!
---
Could you kids stop asking for stupid stuff?
---
I have a separate bug. I will shoot something (usually in VATS) and the health bar doesn't drop at all. Then suddenly, after about the 4th or 5th shot, the bar will drop to where it should be.
---
Ya play anything else new lately? Theres alot better out there imo
---
When reality clashes with Fallout, assume Fallout as the correct source and reject reality.
---
Destiny...?
---
2 vats/AP effects in one is pretty good in most rifles. 25(fire rate)/25(less ap) and 50(crit damage)/25 looks most popular. Some people like explosive.
---
When it comes to main effects... Junkies or bloodied for both auto and non-auto, anti-armor if coupled with explosive or faster fire rate. Instigating for non-auto. Furious for auto.
---
Yeah, survival without VATS, AoE guns and Stealthboys would be dope. I'd permanently switch in a heartbeat.
---
Raiders gonna raid...
---
I love the world too, but the constant respawning of stuff + enemies in the exact same spots, kills it a little bit more every time it happens.
---
Solution? I dunno, random spawns?
---
Never forget, moldy helmets were not on Bethesda or Gamestop but the third party that crafted and shipped said items. Less than 100 units were missing the silica gel packets and that was the issue.

That would make a lot of sense... also, this is my fault for not trying to find out before I got it.. but I thought it could search for specific components that you specified with the terminal.. oh well...

Always enjoy when you post.  How about the pole hook and pole hook plan mods, they seem to have odd criteria/location as I recall but can‚Äôt find the info.

I'm a kid because I like fishing in video games, and 76 would be well suited to it?

I‚Äôve had that exact issue as well it‚Äôs quite frustrating.

Damn. Did anyone try actually turning a beast of the list scorched ,with the help of a scorcheast carpet bomb attack?
---
That's really lame....
---
No, its a rifle

no idea, i think they changed automods shadow mode because of sur. or something?

Do you know if the sneak multiplier is counted as ranged or melee?

Technically they are classed as 'Melee Throwing'

Yes. Afaik that's all you can buy whatever the price.

I wish I could say I didn't see it coming, but when Blades gives you the option wait hours to open a chest or pay to open it now, I'm not surprised at all that this happened.

does not, it is a rifle. not a heavy weapon

Did he really remove the locks? I can usually get into most locked camps if they are using any of the windows that aren't completely closed in. You can even sometimes use power armor to go through walls.

Hey! Pole hook is fairly rare. The easiest way is to server hope the weapon plan spawn at Clarksburg gun store. About 20 plans in that pool so definitely do-able. Let me know if you don't know where I mean. The pole hook puncturing mod plan drops from anglers/gulpers if you have learnt the pole hook. And of course you are welcome to join my discord!

Other than the occasional asshat you run into I truly enjoy just spending time in the game. As for the asshat seem to run into him less in game than I do in real life so I'll take it.

Alright,   this thread is spinning out of control

It's not too early. I want ALLLLL the snow.

I would allow moving characters from survival to adventure, but not the other way around. This way, anyone can try it out knowing that at worst they can always just return to adventure if they do not like the mode.
---
The tomahawks are heavier though aren't they? I'd be happy if they just gave additional meat on kills. I wanted to specialize in thrown weapons, but was bummed there are no real perks, legendaries or even a way to reduce them from a 1/4 lb each.
---
Melee blunt as far as challenges go. Not sure. Last time I used them I was getting 2.65x multiplier

Thought I screenshotted their names, but I didn't. One of them was Squirrel-Hunter, I believe...

Nice! I am still missing that one

Grahm follows the real map that's why you can never find him in WV.

I‚Äôve got the perks for commando, but I switched back to rifleman because my ammo evaporated. Think I‚Äôll have to spend a few days farming lead, steel and acid then crank out about 20,000 rounds.

Look at this guy. Bethedsa barely needs credit for it, they bought the freaking franchise. Almost all of the story and lore comes from the creators and fore fathers of fallout. And that credit should go to interplay. Let's disect fallout.
---
Major factions and races such as ghouls, super mutants, raiders, NCR, the huboligists, enclave, BoS comes from the first or second fallout game. All the lore from those factions come from there. 
---
The x01 armor, enclave power armor. T-51, BoS armor from fallout. FFs leather armor is almost identical to design from fallout 1, which in turn is a homeage to Mad Max.
---
Deathclaws, rad scorpions, ants, rats and mole rats, wanamingos, ghouls, feral ghouls, super mutants, ants, mantis, brahmin, dogs and cyber dogs, wolves and geckos, floaters and centuars, spore plants. All fallout, and all fallout lore.
---
Robot wise, codswort the Mr.gutsy robot. Yupp that's fallout 1 and 2. The robot brain and sentry bot, also fallout 1 &amp; 2. The only new robot bethedsa added was the protectron.
---
Vault tec, Fallout 1, the pipboy, fallout 1. The vault tec lore. Fallout 1 and 2.
---
The 10mm pistol is an iconic starting weapon in both games.
---
So what was new monster wise from bethedsa Fallout 3. Bloat fly, yao guai, mirelurks, rad roaches. Otherwise they reused the BoS, made them a larger faction than what most people believed, retcon some stuff and played it safe.
---
Fallout New Vegas was and is still in many eyes the best fallout game, it's the game that pays the most respect to the old games. And is still my favorite game. They added alot of good and tried to stay true to the past games. The NCR is the "good" guys and they are lore wise about as big as you would expect if you remembers how fallout 2 ended.
---
Than came fallout 4. The gutted rpg game. It's a good shooter compares to NV and F3. But it's still a safe game to play that retcond even more stuff. New monsters include the radstag, blood bug, and the stingwing.
---
And now fallout 76. It's true, it has the most added new monsters and I would say even weapons. But it started as a buggy mess and is now used to suck people dry off money with the atom shop. There are some people at bethedsa that works on fallout with a genuine love for the lore and history off the game. But they are few and far between.
---
So what can we credit Bethedsa with, playing it safe, using the same engine with Skyrim to cut development time, little to no love for the series, retconing shit to kingdom cone. The best fallout we got  post Bethedsa buying the franchise was black isle New Vegas and Bethedsa fucked them over with royalites due to poor sales?
---
Glad you liked fallout 76 but no. They deserve little to no credit for what they done. It's purely buisness. They saw a rich lore that they could monetise by making Oblivion with guns.
---
If you count in Elder Scrolls, yes we have. Skyrim was gorgeous.
---
grahm !!!

I don't get to play for long periods of time, one hour, maybe 2, and I have had the misfortune of starting some quests... and if I don't stick to it for 2 hours, I have to start the quest over the next time I log in.

I‚Äôll gladly give an upvote.

I fucking love this game. It‚Äôs great for role playing and honestly the people who are complaining I think have no idea how great a game this actually is. Not to mention that so far, all DLC has been FREE. FREE! I‚Äôm excited for wasteland era.

No just fighting what shows up, with scorched in the title. This is the only option for actually finishing this weekly.

I always sell below the listed price unless it is a legendary weapon or armor.  I usually sell bulk junk and chems for around the same price that the robot vendor will give me if I sell it to them.  Ammo I sell at 1 cap per piece since we can't bulk it and usually will put extra .38, 10mm, .44 for free.  5.56 ammo is a good seller for me.  I guess  for me I seemed to make more caps selling volume than by selling at a higher peice.  Having a camp in a well traveled area seemed to help sales a lot to.
---
That'd be cool
---
heres an idea: Disconnect them from the power and lock them behind a door, only thing you'll have to do is move them back once you're done!
---
I'd like that, coffee and donuts are all my characters would need to survive anymore
---
Oh but you can earn the atoms in game if you never work again and spend all your time specifically grinding for atoms instead of doing what ever you please in the game (and maybe earning a few random items along the way that way) so don't you dare ever put together the words "pay," "to," and "win."
---
Am I ticked off that they have the balls to charge $7/700 atoms for what's essentially a glorified skin for the fridge? What makes you think that?!
---
Also, while the skin isn't that bad, for 700 atoms, yeah, they can *the other word* off. It won't even look that much different to the player than how you can already make it look in game.
---
Dude if you dislike Bethesda and Fallout 76 that much then why are you here?  If you don't like the game that's fine, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  But why spend time on a subreddit of a game you dislike?  I don't understand the logic.
---
I saw it with grahm
---
I used to appreciate Bethesda. But then it became a constant cash grab with over priced rewards and items and an endless unsatisfying grind for what? Shit loot. Like a powerdrill.. No thanks
---
I think its balanced perfectly. I like sunny days.
---
Nah... if your running toward walls (doors) and mashing on your action button you need to calm down.
---
By the production room. You will have to server jump for a few days before you see it. I‚Äôm not joking.
---
I‚Äôm so tired of MTX, they need to ban it outright.
---
the plans to make the gun are easy to get. 
---
My guess is he is looking for the mod plans.
---
To get the plans to mod your gun is a long tedious process.   Go find lots of screws. 
---
You will need to build handmades, then scrap them to learn the plans.  Use super duper.
---
The same is true for the lever action rifle.
---
I tread the day I finally decide if I love you for saying this or if I hate you for saying this.

Just been there he didn't have any. I did read online I'm too high a level??

Cause the game runs like shit and is/was broken.
---
But it comes in PINK
---
I'm not sure what the excitement for player servers are. I feel like they will just be a more dead version of what we have now

I am 100% down for more realistic and dangerous rain storms. Sounds awesome. Add it to the list!

I'd say the black powder weapons should be guaranteed one-shot kills.
---
So far I've gotten everything except for the Grillmaster Apron, The Peppered Mod and the Red Firework...
---
I got the tenderizer on day 2... then got another just recently. Was grinding for the flag and finally got it... then got another the next round.
---
Maybe if people did it
---
The quest will only trigger when you find a new Technical Data. Any new Technical Data you find will stack together but will not stack with your old Technical Data. When you turn it in, it will take all of your new Technical Data but not your old.
---
People have claimed the following works to change old Technical Data to new Technical Data:
---
* Giving your stack to a friend who drops them one at a time so you can pick it up and trigger the quest
---
* Placing a Technical Data in your vendor, then canceling the sale will change that piece into new Technical Data and trigger the quest
---
* Selling a Technical Data to a robot vendor and then repurchasing it will change it into a new Technical Data and trigger the quest
---
I have not gotten around to trying any of these methods yet.
---
Fishing...or any new interesting content.
---
Same here. I killed five ticks, a wendigo, two bears, a honey beast, four crickets, three ants, and it only marked off the same two. (I work crowd control a lot during these events. So I get lots of chances for flux ingredients)
---
No there is no level restrictions now. I'm litterally standing in front of him now an hes got it. Hop severs an try again.
---
You could just leave a weapon in the universal bank to upgrade with a character that has 5 Intelligence instead of having to level to move SPECIAL points around. This hurts their mission of forcing you to play the game as much as possible with minor inconveniences in game systems and lack of QoL.
---
Wait... you can get repair kits in game without buying them in the Atom Shop??????
---
I've been looking for Combat chest UltraLight plan for a while, if it even exist. emptied stash many times to try to learn it.
---
If I remember correctly you can find the sheilded enclave under armor plan near the giant bean stalk tree at the mire. There's a shack near by with a passcode door. The code can be found in a terminal @ the military wing. All I remember sorry. Better luck looking it up
---
Perhaps the page has been updated since this post, but for me it says: *"The community must kill 8,000,000 Scorched to earn the first reward, including any creature with "Scorched" in the name"*.
---
There are no plans for the base underarmor itself. You have to just buy the underarmor. There are plans for the various linings (treated/resistant/protective/shielded)
---
Gotta kill the legendary prime beast for a legendary item.
---
To share my opinion, and a hope for a better future of this game. I played it with my SO and it was her first Fallout game. Real cute and all that. But the further we progressed the more "broken" the game became. And that was about a month or two after release. We both have it installed, but we don't play it. Instead we spend our time in Ubisofts the division.
---
And I was borned 1987. I grew up with fallout. I have a deep love for the franchise.
---
And y'all cant tell me this series has gone to shit when you first get food condition nerfed not once but at least twice. And then they have the stomach to release a fucking fridge that holds your virtual food good for what? 30 minutes. And it costs 9 real life dollars.
---
I spent 19 bucks on the new Lego valley dlc for Forza Horizon 4. Got 4 unique cars. That's 5$ per vehicle and I haven't even started to count in the new location. I ain't saying that it's the best money I spent but at least I spent money on it. I won't spend 9 bucks on a fridge or a robot. Sadly I'm not alone and people are stupid and Bethedsa knows this. Cash is king. And they will gladly fuck y'all over if someone is willing to spend  20 dollars on some Power armor skins.
---
First they said the scrap kits and repair kits weren't a slippery slope. Then they said the fridge and protectrons weren't a slippery slope. Now I'm looking forward to the ones that say no discount on the Pharma fridge isn't a slippery slope.
---
I was in that boat too. 
---
Meat week volume 1 I grinded sooo hard for the tenderizer, this time I told myself I wouldn't go as far so I played the first round in meat week volume 2 and got the tenderizer first try lol.
---
Keep grinding or just buy one I see is them going for as low as 5k now
---
Hey. Weirdly, the ultra light combat chest mod is a "scrap to unlock" one and there is no plan. You have to keep scrapping combat pieces until you get it
---
Yea..tons actually lol. I get 2 or 3 per queen kill..do enough of those..youll end up with 400 and not know what to do with em ..
---
Legend has it Kotaku is trying to find a way to write another article about nylon bags as we speak

*" 76 has, at the very least, shown us a apocalypse that is simultaneously lush and devastated, full of life and yet somehow barren, unlike anything we‚Äôve seen in the franchise before. "*
---
I credit Fallout 4 player mods for that. The ones that added green trees and grass back in -- what FO4 *should* have been, not the drab thing Bethesda shipped.  I won't play FO4 without those mods.
---
Some billboards reference Boston instead of WV
---
Literally unplayable
---
Probably as a seperate social tab so not to be cluttered with friends who don't play the game?
---
So I tried submitting a heat ticket, but I've forgotten my password and I'm not receiving the reset email. I've added Bethesda as a gmail contact as the website said but still nothing. As for my internet speed, its 180 Mbps
---
They also moved survival resources to help with the launch of wastelanders. 
---
Because Devs actually do things when its not a patch day, like getting the next patch ready.
---
And yes, they also took away a game mode that noone was using.
---
The Fallout and ES series comprise most of my "Top 10 games" spots. Both are fantastic, and while yes- all of them are buggy as all hell, I can't deny the sheer wonder of them when I play.
---
People get too god damned hung up on stuff. These franchises are amazing, fun, and I hope they keep cranking them out for a long time. (And I hope that modders keep fixing them for the rest of us!)
---
Many thanks for info :)
---
Our group is anywhere from 4 to 12 strong, we always help each other and we do all the endgame stuff together. 2 available"playtimes" mornings and nights we have a few on, and do a big run Saturday night. My psn name is same as here. We are mostly lvl 70 and up,but hang out with us and you will gain many lvls quicklyü§ó

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1qib7/shielded_enclave_underarmor_plan_now_spawning_on/ This is what you were referring to.
---
correct.. its not like it was a surprise
---
atom shop and shelving survival
---
If Grahm does not have it, try the Free States vendor in Whitespring (can be found at the spa with the assaultrons).
---
If you get a couple pieces of legendary armor with poison resist, the damage is minimal. The Washout raid also becomes trivial. Nothing can hurt you (assuming you have decent armor).
---
Pay to win?

THE SOUTH WILL RISE

That would be cool and maybe we could actualy use skies for more then making them into useless swords.
---
Sure cuz playing a friends only server is a real bummer. Not everyone wants social interaction with randoms.
---
Same I was totally looking forward to wastelanders, survival style.
---
Here is why I think I have a right to be picky on Beth with 76. I bought this when I paid for fallout 4. 76 is simply in my eyes a multiplayer expansion for fo4. The models are all imported from fo4. The stuff they sell me in the atom shop are mostly imports from fo4. The story line bland and the world feels lonely and desolate with NPC interaction. Wastelanders is coming, sure but that still doesn't make 76 a stand alone tittle. Its a multiplayer component for fallout 4 in its "current" state... And as many have said, its still got its bugs to be ironed out properly.
---
Don't get me wrong I love the game and have high hopes for its future. But as it stands its simply a multiplayer add on for fo4 and not a stand alone tittle. Less bugs more content and then i'll sing praise along side you.
---
Yeah I-65 runs through TN north to south
---
1. That new camp is fantastic.
---
2. I was hoping your "response camp" was literally just a long chain of staircases and single platforms floating high into the sky. Possibly in the shape of a middle finger when viewed from the right angle.
---
Anyone can be killed.
---
That makes sense. I had 2 pieces of armor that used to have the broken Radiation Resist that became environmental resist with whichever patch that was. I thought it was for disease resist only, and changed those pieces out. I guess I will have to find one or two new ones again. 
---
Thank you for the reply.

Excuse me, what does "AFAIK" mean?

Well hey if you're on PS4 I will take some off of your hands.

At a low level, put your known plans and ammo you dont  use in your vendor.  
---
Clothing items sell decent too for the fashonistas out there.  
---
For weapons and armor, wait till you are a bit more comfortable with the wasteland.
---
Though,  you can put everything you arnt going to use in there, someone may buy it.  I have sold some pretty silly things from my vendor that I put up as a joke.  But they sold.
---
Crashed space station!!

Harpers ferry vender bot sells it. On another note. Anyone looking for the Artilery plan. Go to Watoga shopping plaza the bot sells them in there for 190 caps

Don‚Äôt forget that the Nuka Cola Squirt gun isn‚Äôt in Fallout 76

What‚Äôs so wrong with the perk card system? Just curious, first time I‚Äôve seen any major complaint about it. Imo it‚Äôs a great way to bring the traditional FO perk system into a multiplayer setting. And some builds are always gonna be more powerful than others, that‚Äôs just how online games with skill-trees and perks work
---
Oh stop it! You're as punny as me üòÇ
---
Are you trying to break the game the rest of the way? The engine struggles with the current texture packs.
---
I got three and pooped them out into paper sacks to noobies.
---
Sorry about your luck....
---
They too heavy to sell so I gift them
---
Even if they added snow machines to ski hills and localized the snow and cold it would be cool
---
What I particularly enjoy is how much I have to scrap so that my virtual children in the house of my real life husband and I may have just one more magazine in their magazine rack. Did I mention that magazine also takes up stash space? Because of course it does. Would be nice to permanently assign it to the camp at the cost of scrapping it in the stash or something.
---
üëç Random encounters like this are some of my fondest memories in game.
---
In this thread: everyone bitching about Atom shop purchases.
---
In game: Every camp I visit is chock-full of Atom store purchases.
---
Personally? I'm stuck in a vicious loop: 
---
1. I see the ridiculous prices of Atom store things, and refuse to buy them.
---
2. I see all of the cool stuff in peoples' camps, then feel regret that my camp looks so boring in comparison.
---
3. Repeat step 1.
---
If they were picked doesn‚Äôt it remove the lock now?
---
Yes, they did server maintenance.
---
Dolly sods, the other building, not the one for the stings and things, has a chance. The next town north of Grafton, forget the name, has a big church, can have a couple,  There is a shack in the Bog West of sunshine farm, has several different bugs with a chance for a couple ants.(campfire tales wet kindling, but event)
---
I‚Äôm not sure
---
They also take up budget too ... each item you display.  Kinda dirty.
---
Reason number two why I never ended up getting the original fridge.
---
Anyone else find it amusing that the only thing "new" about Meat Week 2.0, has been new Atom Shop items?
---
Bethesda, cackling quietlyto themselves as they rub their hands together: "Let's recycle an old event, but play it off as though the community were responsible for having 'unlocked' it; they'll feel a false sense of accomplishment, keep playing the game, and hopefully attract new players, all of whom will buy Atoms."
---
I was looking for the mod plans for it thanks for reading my mind. Also thanks for the idea of building and scrapping 
---
What's super duper?
---
There is a gap of I believe a little more than a week between the cleanup event ending and the beginning of November.  Hopefully they fill that gap with a Halloween event and then Wastelanders at the begining of November.
---
Isn‚Äôt that what the social tab already is?
---
Stupid to compare a mobile game to a full multi platform game.
---
Despite reddit's circlejerk against mobile games they are one of the biggest markets and anyone who knows how monetisation works is going to understand why mobile games are like that.
---
This game, on the other hand. 
---
"the store will only be cosmetics" -&gt; repair kits, scrap kits, fridge, robots
---
"atoms earned in game" -&gt; like 10 a fucking week unless you want to treat the game like a job and farm them constantly just to afford the overpriced shit.
---
"constant content updates" -&gt; but the rewards are shit and all new outfits, skins and camp items go into the cash store instead of in the actual game to be earned.
---
It's definitely all because the game was a failure. Not as many people playing as they hoped = not as much money being earned which lead to this shit where they desperately need to try and get as much money as possible.
---
I think bethesda probably regrets taking a risk and trying their hand at an online game.
---
0/10
---
I really hope they get wastelanders out in November I mean I want it to be polished and all but I worry about further player dropoff when the holiday games start coming out. Honestly I'm betting a lot of people are jumping onto Outer worlds later this month so Fallout 76 can't really afford too much of a content drought like it has been lately IMO. Hopefully this weeks Inside the Vault will give us some hope.
---
As Far As I Know
---
If he goes to any other Fallout of Bethesda related sub he‚Äôll get downvoted to hell just for putting 76 in the title
---
I‚Äôd be super down with that - or even just flagging yourself across servers as looking for a group for a raid or something like that.
---
I'd say they are pushing to have it out atleast a few weeks before Christmas. With this being somewhat of a soft relaunch, they'll want to scoop up all extra sales that will come around Christmas. So that means it needs to be early enough for it to release, get some good feedback and leave enough time for people to buy the game for themselves/others for Christmas.
---
So, add a little Fate / Diablo to the game?
---
Then, if they do, players will diss it for ripping off Diablo?
---
Probably not going to happen.
---
its a Perk under luck that sometimes makes 2 for the price of 1.
---
at rank 3 its a 30% chance to "duplicate" a crafting creation. 
---
Everyone should have this perk, put it on when you craft anything for possible doubles (works on food, ammo, stims, meds, weapons, armor).  It does not duplicate bulk.  But does work on smelting.
---
Hell yeah!
---
Thanks sergeant!
---
I don't mind if someone has a floating camp, some are really cool regardless. I myself like for my camp to be at least possible irl, so even my floating camps have had many steel beams attaching to the ground with cement blocks for realism. I still like  for them to at lest look like a building.Once I'm done with my new character I'm gonna move to the forest for good, and build something spaced out on the ground that i don't have to worry about getting destroyed every couple minutes by supermutants and charred ghouls
---
&gt;I'm sure a ton of people would insta buy.
---
Not when they cost the equivalent of 3 fucking dollars.  Seriously, 3 dollars to put garbage in your camp.
---
I am partial to the AA instead of Furious.  
---
Also, Less AP cost i find is better than faster meter fills.
---
So AA instead of Furious.  IMO
---
Plastic pumpkins you want? Poof..... 800 credits in the atomic shop
---
I don't know what people think they are searching from data files, when the game directly tells gauss is energy weapon, and the game tells nothing in contradiction to that.
---
It's clear Bethesda messed up and made certain weapons to stop dropping as explosive, without intention.
---
Yeah I'm sorry friend. You're better off though. Stay away from this mess lol
---
Stilts or if you know how to stack foundations can make your base at least look possible irl, which is fuctional so they can't be destroyed but also look good.
---
I just built them in the front yard, put them on a mat with just a sliver of the mat sticking out, pick up the mat and move the whole thing in. Can't take the mats out this way, but I like the way they look, floor protection in your work areasüëç
---
I saved that comment to find you if I find one.
---
I've offered to pay 15k for that plan but nobody would part with it. Currently there is a post offering 35k and trades and nobody wants to give it up.
---
I'd love it this year but wont be mad if they delay. I'm super pleased with the idea if it. It's what I was hoping for from the get go.
---
Thanks. There is so much I don't know about this game. I'm amazed I've reached level 8 nevermind 80!
---
Ooh! Or snow cone machines!
---
I have been playing for the last 33 years. Started with the arcades and C64. I had almost every console, bought all the magazines, collected games, cartridges, tapes. Fallout is not the greatest saga of all time, but one of my favourite ones. Flawed games can be satisfying.
---
Bethesda would find some way to make your items disappear forever or some way for you to access someone elses bank and at the same time make it cost 1000 Atoms. Otherwise its a great idea
---
Used to do that but they patched it and claimed it was a bug
---
Wut?
---
Michelin model XGV, size 75R14 inch wheel.

---
Exactly! And even though I didn't need to help him at all I figured I'd give back since someone provided me the material to craft my Excavator armor during my lower levels. This community is great.
---
OP, while I get that this is how you feel (and I'm sure others do as well), and you're very much entitled to express your opinion. However there are others who are equally fans of Bethesda and/or the Fallout franchise who have varying degrees of negative opinions from being just disappointed to being outright livid with how the game has been handle from launch and afterwards.
---
While there are plenty of things that are laudable about the game itself. For me personally, a lot has to do with the world building and some quest lines. However, they are GREATLY overshadowed by issues and controversy.
---
As you well admit to issue to the game, the main problem is that the good parts of the game (not just the world but a few other aspects) just gets overshadowed by all the terrible issues. That's really it. While it's disappointing that the few good aspects get lost in the mix, to be fair, Bethesda brought this upon itself by releasing the game in such a poor state, way too early and then doing a terrible job with support after the fact.
---
Back in the day, Bethesda would usually get a free pass, to the frustration to some players and fans. However after Fallout 4, they no longer have that luxury. Nor should they.
---
Bloodied&gt;AA&gt;Furious imo.  Furious only works if your using it on one target for a while. If you hit another enemy it loses all the bonus damage
---
My bad, thanks for info
---
Definitely AA over furious, speaking from experience
---
Are there games that have really engaging fishing minigames?  
---
I'm genuinely curious how a game can make an activity that revolves around sitting for long periods doing nothing a fun game mechanic.
---
Give me a moment I‚Äôll come back with something.
---
No problem!
---
Because asking why Bethesda isn‚Äôt receiving more credit with the way 76 launched and all the negativity is a question thought up with the sole purpose to pander to a small audience who will undoubtedly let him turn it into an echo chamber and then it goes back to ‚Äòeveryone who doesn‚Äôt like 76 is a bandwagon hater‚Äô that was ever so popular when it received record low reviews from every source.
---
Im almost positive Im not going to have a single reader but I agree with you in giving credit to Bethesda for a good looking world. However, there's a huge amount of unused space and a lack of significant personal investment that motivates me to return to places in the game. It's like a museum. You can walk through it once, but motivation to come back so soon is limited. That's what this world reminds me of. An interactive museum of a brief moment in history. A world you just walk around to find out what happened and there's no accountability to change it. In fact, there's no accountability at all. Why care about some missing kid when everyone is already dead? Why care about missing cryptid hunters? Everyone is dead. There is no real ending and no real change you bring about in this world. An interactive museum of a brief moment in history, on a very large park. The only thing you can do is take out enemies for a brief moment before they respawn. No one wants a game to feel like a school field trip to a museum. Or play game as if you are a journalist finding out everyone's story like that journalist on fear of the walking dead series. Well at least she met real live people not just written notes. 
---
Now, the world is beautiful. It's full of little details that tell a story if you slow down and pay attention to the detail. Kind of like astronomy. You observe and pay attention meanwhile figuring out the history of the universe. Speaking of, I haven't bothered to check the details of the stars to see if there are any hidden easter eggs. Believe me, Im a world type of guy and explored every inch of FO3,4 and NV. FO3 had more little details then NV and 4. Back to the point. There's no accountability for figuring out the history of the universe as there's no accountability to learning the fate of the people before you in the game since it has happened and can't be altered. The game is pretty good for causal things but what I think Todd failed to do was providing incentives to players to work together besides perk cards and random events. You can make it work with no npc players, you just need more incentives for people to bond. Perhaps make it possible to either live in the city in a allotted space where you can drop your blueprint and spawn your camp or go out in the countryside. Being in a city gives you advantages of city quests and vendor spots. Allow a system to customize quests players can make such as providing X amount of an item for caps. Factions....ect. You can rely on the people to be NPCs but you need to give them the tools they need to express their rpg elements besides creating different kind of camps. The game is very limited in being able to express your actions which was what gave previous FO games its glory. You can nuke a whole area. But again, your nuke has very little consenquence besides a random holotape from the overseer which doesn't make any sense to randomly show up and leave a voice recording as if she has been stalking you from the beginning.
---
Im not trashing the game. Im at level 83 and have given them money for repair kits. Honestly the only real thing that is making me mad right now is the checkpoint system for quests with constant random disconnects making me put I Am Death and a BOS quest where you are in the bog because the game keeps crashing towards the end when I am running out of supplies. Check point me at every update please so I don't waste so much time.
---
What do you play on?
---
Armor with weapon weight reduction...
---
Anti-Armor was recently fixed to work with non-ballistic damage, so it should pierce through players' rad resistance now too. Except for extremely lightly armored foes, Anti-Armor is basically a +29% damage boost overall. Furious hits up to +50% damage once you max it out, and since the Radium Rifle is automatic it shouldn't take you long to reach that cap. 
---
If you're using VATS a lot though, Anti-Armor + Less AP cost is just barely better than Furious + faster crits, IMO.
---
Also speaking from experience.  AA is the top end legendary unless you are a bloodied build. 
---
Even in a bloodied build, unless you are under 50% health, AA still wins. 
---
Once you drop under 50% life, then bloodied becomes META.  if you use full health build, AA will be your best friend forever (with the exception of Instigating sniper builds)
---
Because people like to whine and bitch rather then praise.
---
I just explored North of Vault 51, as far as I could go, and I ended up climbing some rocky bluffs. While doing so I swear I saw what looked like small flakes of snow around me.
---
Someone posted that they got past the boundary line however I was unable to.
---
IIRC, _yes_.
---
Medic's, not much. Quad is a pretty good effect, but it depends on what the second and third stars are. Explosive and Faster Fire Rate would be *excellent* second stars, and increase the value quite a bit.
---
I think Point Pleasant is also at the opposite side of the map. The developers said they were aware of the liberties they took, but wanted the home of Mothman in really badly.
---
Personal preference bud. Some of us like building CAMPS an junk decor.
---
If you have a mule and a friend, farm the raw, drop it to the mule and log the mule off. Bring mule back whenever you get enough hrf, that being the obvious bottleneck. Just a suggestion. My flux mule has hundreds of raw and can make stable whenever me team pulls hrf.
---
7000 for the one that doesn't say it's sworn to carry your burdens.

I'm having the same issue, but I've already hit the pile of bones on the other side of the lake. The compass is pointing me to the den, but there is nothing there.. I've already examined the skeleton and the bear carcass.. frustrating..
---
I got the tenderizer and the spicy mod plan and I‚Äôm hanging on to them to sell after meat week is over
---
Kill ticks there are alot at moonshiners shack. Aswell as the logging yard below.
---
Every time I manually log off the game tells me I was "disconnected from the server" As if it's saying "you didn't quit me, I quit you"
---
I've been bloodied since the game came out when the gods graced me with a bloodied explosive pump at uranium fever :p
---
Also yeah I never messed with furious it's too slow ttk compared to bloodied/instigating on the right gun
---
Looks like youre farming ticks.  Have fun.
---
Guaranteed spawn at the moonshiners shack.
---
Mothman is worth it. I know that Grafton is actually south of Morgantown IRL too

I'm not so sure that they're withholding as much as you seem to think.

I helped him out. Don't know if my karma is high enough, but generally I am.. Haha. 
---
Everything went well. (Minus a surprise visit by a scorchbeast, which we quickly dispatched of, at my camp.. ;D)
---
I would love to decorate my camp with junk too.  But not for their price point.  90% of the things in the atom shop are overpriced and you can't justify it by saying you earn atoms in the game.  If I wanted to pay for my atoms then I'd be shelling out 5 bucks for a different texture on my stash box.  That's ridiculous.

What is forged?

Second third are +1 agility and Vats critical shots do +50 damage
---
I noticed this about the capital building
---
Seriously.. I* would DEFINITELY start working on a way to make coffee before I got to work building my fusion generator... lol.
---
What? Everything im the game has armor. Hence mutant slayer/ hunters ect ect.
---
Link literally has scorchbeast not scorched... I get it‚Äôs a typo but it does not say scorched under link for sale, I copied and pasted it from link.
---
I got the tenderizer my first mission, but I didn‚Äôt know it was any good so I scraped it.
---
Then dont buy it. Personal preference, still earn a lot of my atoms through in game. I've spent 20$ when buying the 2 atoms bundles an earned the rest through game play an have every thing I want.

10 Crown Store exclusive homes beg to differ. Most of them cost around the ballpark of 14k, which costs $100\~. The "best" price for the crown-store exclusive homes is 8k, which you would have to buy two 5500 packs to get, costing around $80. Those are what I was referring to (albeit sarcastically.)
