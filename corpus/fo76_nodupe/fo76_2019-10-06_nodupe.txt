Have not used it much but a sneak/rifleman build seems like it would be your best bet.
---
Lol yeah I can see that. Some are turds for sure. Majority of the players are pretty good tho.
---
Palace of the Winding Path. Rifle Gaming did a nuke video there when it used to have super mutants. Now it’s ghouls, but the event is way harder to spawn because it’s part of the random public events stuff.
---
If you want some ammo I’ll make you some for free. Just hit me up
---
You can also favorite them, that prompts a a message box that asks if you'd like to destroy it
---
Count me in.
---
Are we only doing current Camp builds? If so, I'm fine with that. If not, I want to submit this as my entry:
---

---
Or this:
---
https://youtu.be/SxXAJILV-mM
---
I just completed a Camp build that glows in the dark, so I think it will place well. That video will be posted early next week.
---
its most likely a driver issue (or device assignment) on your end.
---
I have two character with this mix. Add in cavalier or sentinel as secondary’s if you can find them.
---
Would be nice if when we reject daily requests, we're given the option to reject them permanently. Getting sick and tired of rejecting the quest, only for the server to crash two seconds later and the quest is back on when I reconnect.
---
Ah, thanks for that tip! That helps. Does it roll when you're in the area, or does it happen when you/someone in the area can physically see it on the screen?
---
I see what you did there, Corporal Hicks!!
---
Finally a reason for me to log back in to my Twitter account.
---
Good days and bad ones. Maybe they are working in the back ground... Or more people doing this mine hack to ruin it for others.
---
Yup. Me, too. It’s got me mashing now.
---
Not on PlayStation lol
---
Hey still better than the normal version!
---
That works until it you're near Grafton again and it triggers the daily. Don't bother rejecting the quest, either, because it'll show back up again when you end up on another server for what ever reason.
---
What do you want for them?
---
I wish more than anything I had the gold and black subway tile floor. Other than that, if I wanted something, I just bought it. I love being middle aged and having money I can blow on ridiculous stuff like that lol
---
No problem.  I wasn't poking fun.
---
I am just Southwest of Firebase Hancock; where the Savage Divide meets Cranberry Bog. Parallel with Johnson's Acre.
---
Does it when your close enough for it to spawn. That's why sometimes they have the green haze still and sometimes they don't when you find them. The green haze is the indicator that that mob has won the roll to become a legendary.
---
Yes.  Both of those plans.   I bought both.
---
It took me about 300 ash heap events to get it
---
Today i saw a live nuke in the road.  Got the option to disarm it.   I picked the right wire and received some nuclear materials
---
Someone wrote that the odds to recieve the plan can be written as once every 1700 times, so 300 might actually be lucky.
---
Concentrated fire works by increasing the damage per shot by a flat amount. Each card level increases how much that increase is, but it does not work like furious where it increases with each consecuative hit.
---
What's your psn?
---
I’ll try digging around the device manager
---
Mine hack? what would that be if I may ask?
---
250DR is  bugged . So that's not good.   Saw a you tube video yesterday of someone spending 4k scrip and I was surprised how often 250DR came up.
---
 I think it has been broken since launch.
---
The way the game was advertised before launch they were saying that you never know whats going to happen when bumping into another player, but you know that you are going to shoot them and theyre either in passive or give you the sick emote
---
Oh ok..thanks
---
I can see it now, the Fall Atom Bundle..
---
Sent and Cavs are tertiary, yeah. Sent doesn't work crouching but I like the broad range of defensive options
---
Hands down the best Heavy in the game. With Stabilized it's basically a full-auto sniper that does 1k+ damage per shot (without VATS). Once you use a BFFR Gatling Gun you'll never need another gun, trust me hehe.
---
They should completely wipe all characters and start everyone off fresh. But don't tell anyone until a day before launch so that player base doesn't drop until release.
---
I had the plan learned on one of my old characters, unfortunately I don't remember how I got it. Either I got it out of a level 3 locked thing, or an event
---
I don't think (and I may be wrong) that you've experienced proper pvp in this game, especially after the damage cap. I know that is not the point of workshops, but it is still one of their mechanics. I'm not trolling, at least not to my understanding. I go to a workshop I kill someone and I stay back and wait for them to kill them again. Why should I, and everyone who plays pvp unistall? Just because we don't like to play the game the same way as you doesn't mean we shouldn't be allowed to.
---
Also, is this not a wasteland? Why should we have to play the way you want, where we all have to be friends? 
---
If you don't like workshop pvp you can choose not to take part in it, by ignoring workshops. We had a mode, survival, where people did this happily, but then people who played it casually complained that they were continuously one shot (something I can't do as a melee player). So damage got nerfed, and here we are again with more complaints about pvp. 
---
It's impossible to make everyone happy and Bethesda has done a great job trying, but it's impossible.
---
They would have to have a mode where its pacifist only, which I'm more than happy for, then an adventure mode, where you have workshop pvp, and then a survival mode, where its every team for themselves.
---
I can't understand why everyone plays an apocalitic themed game and expects us all to be friends and help each other. 
---
Sorry if this comes off as a rant, but it's tiring to have everything nerfed over and over again because people who play the game casually have a greater voice over the people who've stuck around since day 1
---
I read that title best thing that I read yet
---
Smh
---
I have the damage numbers on, and it is not increasing damage by any flat number whatsoever.
---
Where are you getting the dmg values for the Concentrated Fire? It won't be shown in the Pipboy since it only works in VATS
---
Ah okay I was wondering why some had the haze and some didn't.
---
Unfortunately not many people wanted Survival mode.
---
Ah yes catering to everyone so no one is happy. Fool proof plan.
---
Trophy is for terminals bro not locked things
---
Throwback Tuesday Bundle
---
With a full bloodied build, I can get my bloody x-bow up to 450dmg. I like using it to clear West-tec, but it can be tough once you lose stealth. Wish they had a 3 round mag, like in NW.
---
Yeah, probably the same guy who is over level 300 on NW aimbotting
---
I have floating damage numbers ON. So it constantly shows 79 when shooting the same spot. Arm for example.  I did my test with a handmade on a super mutie. Got 79 until my AP depleted. I have concentrated Fire lv 3.  It did NOT give me any damage boost per shot.
---
Nice.  using limitations from complaints on complaints to your advantage.
---
Crouch while reloading and it will temp fix it... Until you need to crouch to reload again.
---
Still 2 shot /limb is very good on launchers. Dont be super hasty to scrip it.
---

---
Soooo you don't spend the first 2 hours creating your character? Haha
---
Well sorry that was 300 times once I started actively looking for it so I would at least add another 100 to that
---
And if that fails, relogging usually does it too!
---
I put any plans and recipes that I already know in my vendor for free. Been doing it for about two months now, and the overwhelming majority of visitors to my camp have just taken one or two and left the rest. Only two players have ever emptied my vendor, and they were both high levels, so I was pretty sure they were just talking them to sell. 
---
Personally I don't take what I don't need. If I came across a vendor with everything free I would only take one or two things max, and only if I needed them. I'm not so hard up for caps or items that I need to profiteer off someone else's good will.
---
I'd like survival back, but from a business point of view it won't work. Too many people don't like pvp, probably because they haven't put the time into farming legendaries and having a good build for it, and these are the players Bethesda listens to. And I understand that we have nuclear winter, but it's not the same. 
---
PvP is a core aspect of this game, and everyday I see posts of people trying to remove pvp or nerf pvp, all because they choose to engage in pvp parts of the game but didn't want the consequences. At the moment with the lack of content all we can do is farm for pvp since nothing else is really worth it. 
---
We've had the damage cap because people complained about 1-shots, we had the armor buff and now in pvp power armor is too op, at least against melee. And now when we try to pvp at workshops, people get mad.
---
I don't understand who buys a post apocaliptic themed game and expects everyone to be friendly.
---
You doing okay, OP? Got a thing for blood, eh?
---
Have you won games like this? Crossbow iron sights seem a little wonky too
---
Yeah but I’m sure that you can’t truly server hop these days, I get thrown back into the same pool of servers.
---
Honestly it is because all of my (albeit incredibly limited) interactions have been good that I was even willing to take a chance.
---
It would be nice if I could just find one of the bastards already
---
One of my favorites is the Skeleton reaching out of a pile of rubble in a wall in the Asylum while holding a Teddy.
---
All 12 survival players coming out to complain.. It was a ghost zone. Nobody cared for it.
---
Uninstalled, reinstalled, updated, no dice. It will pick up the 30 year old mono 3.5mm mic I plug into the front of the case but not my usb mic
---
I server hop by hitchhiking on my friends servers.
---
Online now, got busy earlier.
---
Well I was home when you posted and I'm at work now lol.
---
Amen
---
I put the prime receiver on a Furious plasma flamer. It is ridiculously not fair to the computer, so I mostly keep it in my stash. It made Kill Robots With An Energy Weapon really easy to do though.
---
A burning cross with a skeleton on it to put outside your camp
---
I wait it out in the safe zone in a bush and people walk right past me and I don’t even need the iron sights 3 shots and they’re down
---
Quad and TS can't be on the same weapon, and TS is trash. So yeah, of course it'd still be shit.
---
If you can get a partner to run a second silo with you in tandem then nuking General's Steakhouse and Robco is surprisingly productive. Decent amount of ghouls, seems to spawn more legendaries inside Robco and the Steakhouse. Great variety of flux. It has been a while since we've tried this so not sure if anything has changed.
---
Ah but do you also win matches?
---
Yeah, honestly I’m shit at aiming because I panic under pressure so I’ve won three so far this way
---
New Gad is fun as well. Lots of glowies plus you get to see the lower levels put on their armor and explore which is rather satisfying.
---
We did the Nuka Cola factory once and it was okay. Glowies inside but not as good as the Steakhouse/Robco combo.
---
Hand scan is the only way in afaik. Maybe go back and make sure youve completed all the quests to get the title.
---
Well ofc I do doesn't mean I can't judge everyone else for it &gt;:(
---
True that’s good if you got lots of em
---
I've never seen Concentrated Fire boost damage outside of targeting weak points.
---
I spent more time than Id like to admit trying to pull this off and couldnt. I also want to know this secret if it exists.
---
ArnhjolfM34
---
I'll be online right now, so I'll be seeing your FR.
---
that is THE coolest C.A.M.P. I've ever seen.
---
I just want it to be a worthy encounter.
---
Rarest creature (for my time playing), zero rewards for it.
---
Its not like Im obsessing over it and kicking myself over it. It just annoys me a little.
---
Glad to know Im not the only one. Too bad though. Im sure it would look pretty cool.
---
K, thanks
---
If it’s who I think it is that’s named after a certain glowing mob, then I’ve seen him and killed him before. Power armor gatling plasma build?
---
Once you get general it requires you to request a keycard and code piece (and retrieve them) even if you already have both. You have to go through the motions.
---
Yeah bethesda only listens to half the players because we get downvoted just for having the opposing opinion, as is shown here
---
I run a bloodied sneak vats crit build. My primary weapons are a BE pipe revolver and a bloodied crossbow. I usually one shot everything. I sometimes switch to a quad pipe revolver and a quad crossbow. I still manage to one shot everything but as soon as i lose my stealth i have to switch to the quad pipe revolver to keep the mobs at bay.
---
And that would be another thing juice head would bitch a bout
---
I can put the mod on ur lever action if u want ;)
---
Lol only reas tldr huh
---
it does not increase damage when targeting weakpoints in VATS, and that's exactly what I'm pointing out. I am surprised no one has noticed this but me.
---
I got mine from a locked explosives crate but had to unlock a shit ton to find it.
---
Ah, found it. On me, normal PC as well, it's on to the right. Thanks.
---
Yes please are you playing now? I'm goblinshark77 on PSN. I'll go hop on if you're available.
---
Ive noticed that the only times I disconnect is if the internet goes out for a second. I only noticed because I would be on the phone, and the phone call would freeze for a few seconds to reconnect, and I would disconnect from the server at the same time. This used to not cause a disconnect, they probably made some changes to the net code to instantly boot people who disconnect to stop duping or tricking the server, which makes it seem like the game is more unstable when really they just tweaked how the game handles packet loss or short disconnects. Obviously I'm assumimg a lot, but this is what I theorize is going on.
---
Even expensive internet has little cut outs like that and most people wanna blame the game and they dont wanna admit that, or they don't know. 
---
Fallout 4 on consoles still crashes more than 76 for me. Fallout 4 crashes all the time when your in downtown Boston. Stability on consoles is still atrocious, they even added a loading screen that interupts your game play and tries to load the area and prevent this, but half the time that crashes for me as well. 
---
Fallout 4 also has a mode that only lets you save in beds.... A mode that I have put many many hours into, I've spent days without making any progress, I'll go off and do something just to have the game crash and take me back an hour or 2 to the last bed. 
---
So 76 doesnt bother me in the slightest, I think it is actually very stable now. I go days without crashes sometimes. I have crappy internet and I still only disconnect from servers when my internet poops its self for a minute.
---
Yeah I’m online right now my Psn is ariellapatatacol
---
It has not made me do this on any of my characters.
---
I would ALSO like to add that I have mistakingly assumed that my SCREWS were my SPRINGS. I actually have about 200, but I'd still be willing to trade them.
---
The game needs more content to keep people busy.
---
Can you just go inside and activate it?
---
Someone posted a video about 2 months ago getting the plan from the Battle Bot event in the Ash Heap.

Can’t trust those Raiders! Glad you’re have fun and unlike some understand it’s a game.

Most higher level players will give lower ones PA. I’ve given out a bunch. If you’re on Xbox I think I have a partial T-60 depending on your lvl.
---
I'll give you that on the Q and TS thing, but I don't think you have to "memorize the ins and outs" to know that TS is trash.
---
Np, I figured you either didn't see me or were in a rush.
---
Honestly how can you act like that? You have no context as to what this is other than the fact that I called them Chishito and guess what? she responded to that name because she knew I was joking around. trolling is against the rules of this reddit so you should try to follow them by not posting things like this.
---
Oh yeah that makes sense.
---
Your response tells me that you are being rude just to be rude. She took the time and effort to make this because a lot of people do complain about it and you just sit here mocking her. Your newly added context doesn't help your situation and shows that you are really just being an asshole to be an asshole.
---
Wait is Trading banned by the subreddit? Why did you censor yourself
---
BFFR for sure - you'll hit a DPS you can't hit with anything else. If you're a full on Heavy PA build though, Stabalized and AA make for a great combination without sacrificing your health.
---
Yup. Imagine getting old fashion Halloween masks with the elastic string and outfits for the event. Maybe even plans. You make them out of cloth and plastic and the masks are made with ladle ball string and plastic. And they’ll be upgradable like under armor. It could be in an Apple orchid and we would have to survive a hay ride in a dark foggy path, fighting off gouls and making sure they don’t destroy the hay cart or kill the brahman pulling it.
---
I don't need junk. I take it as a reward for pvp. And as I said workshops don't provide enough resources to justify having them. 
---
Are you gonna tell me that when you fought people you never too their junk or chems?
---
Not sure about your "max caps point" just means you are not spending them on your own choice. In fact caps are so easy to get they have lost value and 5.56 is becoming the new currency.
---
I'm sorry but griefing in this game should not apply to junk. 
---
What is it that people don't seem to understand about this being a wasteland? 
---
We already had the damage nerf, which was what killed survival in essence. Full health melee builds became obsolete in pvp after the damage cap. You cannot compete with FFRAA weapons, now people want to nerf/remove the only aspect of pvp where we can use the builds we have been building for months. Sneaking up and ambushing people should be okay, in a way its using a strategy to maximise chances of winning. 
---
I'm sure it's annoying to lose your junk, but I don't think it's worth nerfing the game for it
---
think it means getting a head shot or other similar weak spot shot but i dont know for sure since i dont use medics gear
---
Fallout games as a whole never once had pvp what so ever in any of its games till tod and bethesda seen how alot of fortnight players liked that styal of game play.along with ESO PVP players. So they hoped to drag them over. But yet it was a fail because true players of fallout are only playing for the adventure side.not having to worrie about other players greafing them at every moment.
---
LOL!!  I had just listened to one of her stories (it was Goldilocks and the 3 Bears for me) before this incident, luckily I was still just exploring at the time and didn't have a trigger finger.  Part of the problem with poor Mr. Publisher's Clearing House is it happened on the roads near Flatwoods, where there are the grouchy Mr. Horticulturists that fire at you, so I think in the split second I did realize it was a Handy, but thought it was one of them and fired anyhow.
---
I was just kidding around with a friend I used to talk about the game with in group chats, my guy. She even offered to buy me the game for PC once. I mean I know that's not a big deal but you don't really do that for someone you don't like lol. More than likely she's gonna read this thread and I wanted to post a little inside joke. Didn't know she'd have people white knighting her without any context but thanks for this l e l
---
Dang. I know for AWOL Armaments you can skip talking to the robot and hit the button. I thought maybe it would work for this
---
I think you take some shortcuts there with your point, ignoring power plants, and the 1400 vendor allowance limit.
---
If some players can actually pay that much, fine by me. I don't think such players play much and use power cores much though.
---
what are you even talking about? you think melee is viable in pvp? it never was, at any point in survival. I have a legacy BE laser rifle, and everyone I play against has a legacy or two. the only people that give me trouble are the ones in strangler armor because of the infinite poison stacks. you are a complete and total pvp noob that is just using ambushes instead of skill
---
Won’t we get that again now with wastelanders ,  for the first few weeks everybody will be doing the fresh quests / but diff is they will be all different levels this time around
---
Nope
---
Like others have stated, you should probably start with Fallout 4.  I would go for the bundle with all of the DLC.
---
Also, I slept on survival mode in my first play through and wish I hadn't.  It is super immersive and unforgiving even at higher levels.  I got bored with "very hard" mode once I was high level.
---
BUT, I love 76.  The players are mostly awesome and willing to help out if you need supplies or help with challenges.  I'm around level 85 or so and I'm just starting to get a little bored with it.  But, farming legendary items and trying new builds is fun, so...
---
Yeah I'm running PA with stabilized. I was wondering how it would be with the AAFFR. Thanks. Think I will try it with the BFFR
---
I have had them on all my characters and have had many variations. My bloody one does a nice amount of damage, I got an explosive executioner's that's fun. 
---
Even a vanilla one was my go to when I bridged that gap from running away from scorch beasts to killing them.
---
Because idk how armor works lol
---
On my pistol character, that's my boss gun. Western, 10mm ... all fun, but the SBQ gets the plasma flaber pistol.
---
Same for my non bloody rifleman. Gauss and tesla through most of pve ... plasma for the boss.
---
Stay out of workshops or bring some tissues. The entire game is tailored to you being able to join the scouts and collect stuffed animals. There is one place betas don't belong and it's the one place they make endless posts about wanting to be.
---
Only 1800 atoms for both and you cant buy em separately
---
Mine seems to work, I just tested it with a medic combat rifle checking my HP before and after. Actually healed a lot more than I was expecting too. Are you pressing the crit button and landing crits so it says "critical strike on..." on the top left side of the screen? edit- I should add, this was testing the personal healing, I was not teamed.
---
It’s definitely understandable. Losing caps is really nothing honestly. You can make that up easily.
---
 
---
The RNG system is basically a bunch of lists that lead to other lists
---
List 1 contains : Item 1, List 2
---
List 2 Contains : item 2, list 3
---
list 3 contains : item 3, item 4
---
List 1 has the following drop rates : item 1 : 50%, List 2 : 50%
---
List 2 has the following drop rates : item 2 : 25%(50% of 50%), List 3 : 25%
---
List 3 has the following drop rates : item 3 : 12.5%(50% of 25%), item 4 : 12.5%
---
So... in this case, the Plasma Grenade Plan is only in 1 specific list but the problem is ash heap rewards are like 5 lists,  so when you complete the quest, it rolls first which of the 5 you get, then it has to roll in the plasma grenade list a few more times to get to the specific Ash Heap "ranged" list where it is listed, and inside that list, its 1 of 40 items. 
---
I did not do the calculation, Pure Savagery did but several people have checked and confirmed his math of 0.058139534883721%

Pvp was doable before the damage cap, obviously not to the same extent as bloody but it was still doable. And yes people have legacy weapons, but from what I played there was always the golden rule of not using them. Only when someone was butthurt that they weren't winning did they come out. And then it was the fun chaos. "Skill" is not having an explosive laser, which has been strong counter to everything. I'd argue if you can kill someone with melee you are more skilled since you have to be able to survive long enough to reduce the distance. 
---
I guess you have your point of view, and although I cannot agree with it, I understand it. 
---
You are trying to make the game more viable for farmers and that's fine. But I can't understand why an apocalyptic game should be catered for a group who does not want an apocalyptic experience.
---
Yeah the word is banned in titles

Pepperidge Farm remembers 400 pound stashes

Lmao! you made my day! I just watched some one do that the other week, at a Tocobell. I swear, over 100 packages of the mild sauce, or at least what was in the container. Lol. He was stuffing his pockets with them, looking over his shoulder to see if anyone was watching.
---
 I was waiting on my order, and standing behind a fake plant, out of site. He didn't notice me, until he turned around to walk out, rushing bye me for the door, with his head down, dropping a couple packs along the way. 
---
I am pretty sure he grabbed a shit load of napkins as well. I didn't say anything, because I was in utter shock. I didn't know if I should say something, or laugh my ass off.

 It was one of those moments where you say to yourself " Are you fucking kidding me"

I wish you the best.

Can't :/ but I did solo run Site A a month ago at level 40 rifleman.

Where is it now?

I mean... why ? It would be lore breaking and Bethesda has enough ressources to create another cool outfit

Yeah, they said next year on the inside the vault.. I'm sure that they are working hard on finishing wastelanders, and then there will be bug fixes for that...and then the holidays. So it'll be spring I'm sure at least.

I miss doing ''home improvement'' on my friends camps by drilling and destroying their stuff, sadly it's not possible anymore but I would still love a legendary one!
---
The legendaries I believe required full 100% completion. Who did what, if anything, mattered none. 
---
Not sure if it always gave a legendary at full completion, might have been random too.
---
I love that idea, brilliant. Let's X our fingers that Bethesda does something special for these folk lore traditions. 
---
Yeah, sorry the fact I was being hassled by the comment made me want to be a little bit of an asshole but just for you! You're not really whiteknighting, you'd do the same for a guy friend I'm sure. Anyway you shouldn't continue to defend against the harassment so publicly, my guy. Those players are specifically targeting you guys for the notoriety
---
Someone tried to sell me one for 5k once. I literally ran away from him without responding. How dumb do you think people are?
---
Correct. Subsequent shots make the vats hit chances grow. 3 cards and a short burst and you're at 95% hit chance even if nothing has changed like distance.
---
Pretty sure it didn't say anything about damage boost.
---
BUT OF COURSE, YOU KNEW THAT! WHO ELSE WOULD IT BEEE?!
---
I think they won't do that because they would have released that already. I mean, people are already walking around in costumes they would decorate their camp too if Beth weren't so deep in bug fixing they'd sell more good stuff people would actually pay to get.
---
Yes, as long as you are hidden or caution you can land a sneak attack. The checks on covert operative only look to make sure you aren't using either type of melee and that's it.
---
Is that you Randy?
---
Surely you understand that other people are reading this.  Out of context, when something looks like an ass, sounds like an ass, and smells like an ass, people will treat it like an ass.
---
r/gaming is honestly just a massive circlejerk. Same goes to r/Fallout.
---
Why there, if you don't mind me asking? There's only 1 big chest spawn, and only 2-4 blue/yellow? Not enough to equip a squad, especially if it's contested.

---
Thanks for the heads up, me and a buddy joined 👍
---
For best results don't try to get both in one nuke. Have the two overlap over the highway. That will give you maximum coverage ideal for flower picking. Once the initial onslaught of curious players dies out you can just bounce between the map markers and stuff should respawn reasonably fast.
---
Oooh buddy I got the dataminers out of the woodwork didn't I

Airport, power plant, bolton greens

If you have the 250 dr while reloading trait, you lose the primary effect (medic) as soon as you reload untill you switch weapons.
---
&gt;irrationally angry
---
Nah. Seems pretty rational to me. 😂
---
It's all I use. A vampire ffr one, a TS ffr one, and a bloodied ffr one.
---
It wasn't easy to get it started, but but once I got 1 in place the others would link up to each other. Hope BGS didn't t screw it up and make them impossible to place now.
---
skill is when both teams have explosive lasers and you still beat them. melee is only viable if you are sucking down stealth boys and thats easily countered with a tesla... I even have a bloody ss meat hook and I dont think melee pvp is viable, and thats mainly because of the changes to vats so you can no longer vats-jump to players, it has nothing to do with the legendary nerfs or damage caps. you continue to show off that you are nothing but a noob that only knows how to gank and not how to shoot.
---
Oof you must be real fun at parties
---
Outer worlds comes out on October 25. Fo76 doesn't have much rpg stuff, even fo4 is kind of limiting.
---
Well said. There are times im on the receiving end of getting a workshop taken from me. Usually it takes 2 or more people to get me but i dont complain. I know the risk when i take a workshop. Some people should quit FO76 and play farmville if they dont like the struggle sometimes.
---
Get some sap to do the prep for you and then steal their launch?
---
What's your gt? I'll help with the queen or silo if you aren't done yet.
---
Oh flame boy you really got me good
---
My friends play borderlands. It's got funny bits but not as much for me.
---
I played a ton of FO4, and now a ton of 76. 
---
If you are into the lonely plot aspect, the storytelling in 76 is really surprisingly solid... if you take the time to read and listen. If you are a click and run to waypoint player not so much.
---
Gt is chasethemac. I'm almost finished with the silo.
---
Good luck. I’ve got two left I need to find in the wild: Guns and Bullets 4 and Covert Ops 1. I’ve found every other one in the wild. Have a string of spots I check every time I am in, but still haven’t been lucky enough to find them.
---
Yeah, I'm excited for that. It's like obsidian is telling Bethesda "this is how it's done". Hopefully it turns out well.
---
K. Joining your game.
---
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
Awesome. Thanks
---
Depends on if you're going for max damage, or good damage while being generally tanky enough to not die to a single proc of acid/poison. The former is Bloodied, the later would probably be Anti-Armour or Junkies, and Vampires never hurts to have around for Imposter. Explosive/FFR are generally the best suffixes. Though hitman's/+% while aiming isn't a bad third option suffix either.
---
"We're rebuilding the wasteland together" I totally agree with you! The current workshop system is not about it. And I vote for changes.
---
So ffr is a desired trait?
---
Youre not realizing that your fucking up the  edginess of a shitpost and keep replying with some sort of know it all attiude by taking it kind of serious.
---
I still don't agree with you, but that doesn't seem like it will change. I can't convince you of my PoV and vice versa. No point in continuing this discussion since we would just be repeating ourselves.
---
Vendors still have it, but my playstyle keeps me low on caps but rich in terms of materials. Thanks, anyway. Will add you.
---
I prefer it to explosive, but it especially useful on a slow firing weapon like the Gatling.
---
Along with your sweepstakes winnings
---
Stop murdering foxes
---
&gt;They should completely wipe all characters and start everyone off fresh. But don't tell anyone until a day before launch so that player base doesn't drop until release.
---
You want to kill a game overnight? Because that's how you kill a game overnight.
---
Will have to look into it. I'm on PC also

Literally just speed demon since that gives 20% and none of the speed boosts stack

All about how

Glad to hear you gave it a shot and are enjoying it. It's a extremely fun, immersive and generally good experience. I myself have been playing since Christmas. I heard about all the bad rep it got long before it came out but didn't let it bother me, figured it was just a bunch of cry-babies who didn't get what they wanted or "envisioned".
---
It does have a boat load of bugs which in general is annoying but the community experience alone makes it worth it.
---
not again D:
---
Brilliant!
---
Hey it’s CrypticFox225.  Come by during the night. The house will be up until Halloween.
---
When you focus on a fox or squirrel or other critter, their name and health bar are red, therefore they are considered hostile. Brahmin are yellow, so non-hostile. Therefore the fox being VATS’ed is correct.
---
Yeah, you can 1-shot most everything with an Instigating Gatling
---
It’s a legit game now. It was previously a mess. All the updates have made it a great game.
---
MrHandyMail: "Greetings good sir/madam, While you were neutralizing the brutes over there, you might have dropped these.  I was compelled to return it to you.   Here you go."
---
I know. I almost messaged you to see if you wanted to avenge Fluffy Jr. Apparently Fluffys children didn't become invincible.
---
Here's a real life lesson. Watch your trigger finger. If you held an actual gun do you shoot first before you know what you're shooting? Hell no! You even keep your finger off of the trigger until you're ready to shoot! So slow down itchy trigger. Take your finger off of the trigger button until you're ready to shoot!
---
In my defense, the first fox was among a pack of scorched and the second fox appeared when I heard molerat noises (which may or may not have been a bug, since no molerats ended up showing up).
---
Then I ask: Can you get the plan only from the Ash Heap Events, or can you find it in Explosive crates (or other places)? There are some disagreement on reddit whether the Explosive crate chance is real or not.
---
This is what I’ve been doing but I earn atoms as I play and I can’t transfer atoms.
---
I know they show up red, but they've never attacked me and I've never seen them attack others, so I'm really unsure why Bethesda considers them hostile. Rabbits also show up in VATS and they definitely aren't hostile. Same with chickens and opposums and squirrels and the like.
---
You guys remember when the alien blaster was the best gun in the game back in the old days?
---
I had an issue with the Messenger yesterday in Lewisburg. The robot just....got stuck and wouldnt go any farther no matter what we did.
---
The Flatwoods monster should drop Flat Wood
---
I shot a cat bc of VATS during the forest Primal Cuts event and I was actually surprised at how sickened it made me feel despite it being nothing but a bit of code. I'm a major cat person so there's that, but yeah when I can't VATS 'friendly' Sierra Bravos but I'm blasting a poor cat in half a second it's a bit silly.
---
You can get handmade rifles at level 15 however only should be used in desperate sitiuations.
---
Good luck getting your loot back!

Ive fought 4 or 5. Their boring. They die in one punch.

Todd is punishing you for not buying repair kits

They Won't buff it bc it would be broken (PvP and gameplay in general)

I knew it lol
---
You don’t need to use the rug glitch. Just build the objects you want to put down in the bungalow and/or greenhouse, blueprint them, store them, and then use your blueprint to place the object.
---
Give it a try!
---
Ahh, I'll have to look to tell you for sure and I"m not at home now but basically the top list is that "grab bag" which i believe is the same for the locked chests and such, but I'll have to look to tell you for 100%

A lot of times there's not enough weak aids swarming in to buff most players adreline anyway. You can get max adreline occasionally but you can't keep it for long, there's just not enough of them.

---
i tend to buy ballistic fiber from the vendors to squeeze more caps out of them
---
Yea that is what I thought but that such dedication since i am on the other side of the whitsprings
---
That hasn't worked. The bug is server dependent, you have to change server.
---
It's GRAFTON DAY!... Again....
---
That motherfucker gon’ pay
---
A lot of them I've seen just flop from the sky at random already dead, recently....
---
The power plants are often picked clean.  Makes server hopping the norm.
---
I stand by my point.  100 caps is nothing.  One trip through any building and you have enough junk to sell for 100 caps, without even considering the weapons you take off the dead baddies. ... if a 100% core isn't worth 1/14 of your daily limit, then you probably don't have much use for power armor. 
---
Open up a vending machine and sell .556 or .45 shells and you make your 100 caps back in about a minute.
---
I know that. No matter how good someone's trigger discipline is however, you also don't run in front of them while they're defending themselves against attackers or you risk getting caught in the cross fire. Unfortunately the first fox was among a pack of scorched and the second one showed up right after I heard molerat noises (which I suspect was a bug, since no molerats showed up). Both were in the wrong place at the wrong time essentially. 
---
I prefer to use VATS as little as possible, but had to pull it out yesterday when I was fighting the scorched because a lot of my point blank, right on top of the enemy shots weren't registering that day unless I fired them in VATS. As for molerats, I nearly always have to VATS them because the game doesn't pause so that I can switch perk cards to avoid the inevitable disease the little ultra dodgy shits will give me on their first bite every single time I encounter them.
---
There’s a lot of junk items that give ballistic fiber on floor 3. Otherwise, I’m not sure what else there is besides the asylum uniforms (there’s like 6 different colors I think
---
Thanks, crouch and be watchful :D
---
Dang. Explains what happened to me when I got caught in that acid/death zone glitch awhile back
---
Everyone who is not shitty at this game should be in permanent berry mentats.
---
Got the game back in March. Took about a seven month break and started to play again and it seems fine to me. Though at level 10 it does seem more difficult due to lack of traders and stores for ammo, armor, food, and water.
---
It's really that rare? I found one frighteningly early into my playthrough and managed to kill it because it couldn't get up to where I was quick enough to fuck me.

What is "banned" completely is "market", directly followed by two spesific numbers, from titles and texts. Technically it's shadowbanned, others just won't see it, but the person using the word won't directly get any message telling about it.
---
Trade posts of any kind are banned too, so whatever automatic system they use to find those, might occasionally get bent by the word trading, like maybe. But the word itself isn't banned, as shown from the above post.
---
Never found anything worthwhile so got bored chasing the *incredible floating scorchbeast corpse* across the wasteland :) They sure do bounce about a lot.

I'll start looking again.
---
The AB in every other Fallout is terrifying to weild.
---
I guess it still is, but now it's more of an oh God oh God, I'm going to be killed.
---
max out the commando cards IMO
---
It’s a mod. Called like crystallizing barrel or something. I can mod it for you on ps4
---
I found it early on right around level 20 or so. My camp was right in the middle of the Forest. The next time I saw the bastard was around level 150ish with my camp still being in the Forest. I'd call that rare.
---
It's awesome that you can kill her in 3 hits but it shows how broken the game is. Launching a nuke takes longer

You’re invisible for 1 minute when the match starts or until you pick up an item within that minute.

Lol luckily their bag was on the ground, not where they broke orbit
---
I'm one of those kinds of people who, if I couldn't buy meat at the store and instead had to shoot animals to get my meat, would end up vegan in a heartbeat. I love animals. As it stands, the biggest obstacle to me becoming a vegan now is the cost and lack of options in my area. 
---
Still I have no problem with shooting an animal if it's going to kill me otherwise, even if that means I also have to shoot what used to be man's best friend in Fallout. I get that it's a post apocalyptic wasteland and I'll often have to shoot animals to survive. In a "my life versus their life" situation, I've got no problem taking them out, even if the "them" is an animal. 
---
But Fluffy wasn't going to eat me so why can't they be treated like the Brahmin in the VATS system? 
---
I'm a cat and dog person so my heart hurts every time I have to shoot a mongrel or a mutant hound and I'm very thankful I haven't inadvertently taken out a cat yet. Heck, I feel bad shooting scorched, ghouls, and mutants because I know they used to be human too.
---
And don't get me started on all the times I haven't been able to VATS something because, even though it's definitely trying to murder me, the game views it as friendly. Looking at you, glitched scorchbeasts.
---
Huh we should be able to vats anything we can hurt. Players when using pacifist shoud of course not be vats targets, neither vendorbots or Gramh. Anything else should be.
---
You just suggest something that makes things worse.
---
In all seriousness though, the front exterior area will respawn with each new visitor, but if the guys in the first locker room are absent, best move on to the next stop. 
---
Also, don't hop servers while at west tek, you'll end up with shitty mutants in the parking lot.
---
And that's why I'd like it to be something that can be toggled in settings. Hunter characters can shoot fox all day long and the rest of us who are either vegan (not me) or get their ingame meat from lunchboxes and animals that attack them (me) don't have to worry about accidentally shooting a fox or one of Murgle the cats relations.
---
I consistently run into this. Ironically, I’m a PvP addict when it comes to any video game and I live for 1vX’s.
---
How is suggesting something that I even asked to be a toggleable feature in the settings going to make things worse? You want to be able to shoot at anything you can hurt in VATS, simply keep the setting turned off. Those of us who don't want to VATS what won't attack us can have the setting turned on. Everyone wins.
---
I thought they would when I first started haha but I’m sure that would lead to a ton of visual bugs
---
If it's scrappable it really wasn't worth keeping all the much, you'll look back on this thread when you get your Legendary Left Leg and lul. I'd help if I could, but on XB1.
---
Yes xbox lag is so bad that it not only black screened me but kicked my xbox1 tottaly off.
---
Reminds me of that bug pc's had a while back.
---
I have gotten the plasma grenade plan 3 times. The first time was from Breach and Clear event, the second time was from Mole Rat Horde; Toxic Valley event and the third time was recently from Lode Bearing event. I’ve never seen it in a crate but I don’t do that much unlocking of explosive crates.
---
The lag is bad to the point it turned my xbox off
---
That's why I'm not all that upset. The only legendary piece I have worth keeping for armor is my regenerating chest piece. All others have just been good stats.
---
As I said, I just came back from not playing for a while and NEVER focused on legendary items. So I think I'll be looking into that a little more when I hop on a few hours a weekend.
---
I found it a lot when I farmed random encounters in the mire
---
If it's not a legendary item just toss it into the favorite wheel. You can't just a friendly scrap it than.
---
Legendary armor can't be scrapped so try find a few pieces of that.
---
Sounds like you don't like Fallout.
---
Certain 3* crylornators with that mod can stop the SBQ freezes her solid allowing others to kill her fast.
---
My favorites wheel is full already. Thought about that. And I never focused on getting legendary pieces, and the only ones I've come across have been garbage. (Except my chest piece)
---
For your alts you only need about 60-70 levels. Then you can play then about normally. My melee alt and my bloodied "mule" are both over level 100 and I have no use for those level ups.
---
Streight jacket
---
It's under luck. It's the same as enforcer but with rifles. It gives you a 30% chance to cripple a limb with a rifle at rank 3. It's a really great perk to bring the SBQ down to the ground. Just aim for her wings and she'll come down right away.
---
I just started a new guy and ran into one while I was only level 10.  It was level 30.  I was prepared to repeatedly get my butt kicked but it teleported away before I could do anything.

Hunters.......i dont care what any one claims what does what, hunter effect is the one weapon effect that will annihilate any creature in this game.  Zealots doesnt do shit,  bloodied;you just respawn so GD much, not worth it for me.  My HE primed can solo the queen and take out all other enemies with very little ease.   And before you all roll your eyes, i also have a TSE, AAE, and a ZE.  NONE hold a candle to my SQB KILLA (Primed Hunters Explosive)....happy hunting. And i look forward to comments.
---
you get health regen by using crits; vats is your friend, spacebar to use the crits, medics solo or teamed works fine. crits regeneration will give you nice buffs. melee and rifle are different categories, that said, switching between weapons rifle and melee without swapping cards isn't too much of a compromise. sure using both has a trade off. i use just one level of the rifleman cards. try it. in your case commando cards, in the same special category. what you have should work just fine.
---
On a corpse (or bag, I forget) in a cart on the big rollercoaster
---
I find  most explosive handmades to be good weapons.
---
Definitely not script.  Demolition expert ( which you have ) helps this weapon.
---
Blowing up car, if it was damaged by a player, should not do any damage to you. Its not true enviroment damage.
---
I blow up cars all the time to get rid of them, everywhere. PvE enemies damaging cars, making them to explose, counts as enviroment damage that damages everyone. And the WS maintenance area with lots of cars, left side of the main enterance,  blowing them up flushes up any ghouls if they are nearby. I do it with my bloodied build, I do it with my high health build, even with my pure melee build. I don't like the potential damage to exists there.
---
I do all the time see other players running away and jumping up even when it's clear Im doing it with few quick bullets, and that it's not a car that has been slowly burning away to reach critical level. I think everyone still gets radiation damage, not sure if my passive mode has any say to that, but the radiation damage is really tiny compared to explosion damage, and you mainly would get a small doze if you are right next to the car.
---
.
---
I've had my fair share of non-friedly players in the game, everyone who plays a lot, probably does, unless you are fit and good enough for PvP. Sure.
---
Hmm it was throughout the whole match like when I died a invisible melee Bob came and wacked me... I also got in a power armor suit and was floating/walking around for a bit minuit. I have a decent amount of hours on survival so I know how invisible items work, it was a glitch
---
It should have a chance to do so.
---
You can solo a launch base.
---
I feel like you have a better chance seeing it low level and it's spawn chance tapers off for some reason the higher level you get. Having it drop a high level legendary would make sense in the case of OPs post.
---
Fastest way to complete it is to get a friend to build you a ton of locked terminals and then hack them. You'll get a bounty but your friend can just kill you and give you back the caps.
---
This is extremely frustrating at workshops and when wanted people are camping at whitesprings station in god mode to troll people.

Personaly i keep all mine marked with a heart next to it so i know witch is what.
---
Weight is not just for real(ish)ism, but also is used to prevent overloading the servers. I'm sorry, but this one will never happen. Best you can hope for is maybe (a big maybe at that) a slight overall increase. I'm willing to bet this is as high as we'll get for a while.
---
It's been one hell of a ride. I've been playing since the beta and I always find something to do in the game whether it's helping out some new Vault Dwellers, fighting off hordes of ghouls and scorched, SBQ over and over, and farming legendaries. My favorite thing to do right now is build power armor for those who don't have power armor or those who want something more, like if they only have Raider but want T-60. I sell legendaries cheap and craft Fury like i'm Mr. White crafting that good blue. I love this game, I love helping others, I always wanted a co-op Fallout, is it perfect? No and nothing is, do I fun? Yes, a hell of a lot of fun every time I log on and play. Looking forward to Wastelanders and that bow!
---
*adds Fluffy Jr to preexisting memorial*
---
They should have the vault be a general lobby and then allow you to join a match once you’re in the lobby and when you finish a match you get kicked back to the lobby
---
Doesn’t it constantly spawn always at hemlock holes or whatever it’s called, in the dried out acid lake out front I ALWAYS see it, haven’t seen it spawn above level 30 though but don’t ever sit around to get it to spawn at my level ( if even possible)
---
Yes, it is still very much a fun game.
---
We are getting npcs in a new update coming soon. Game is/has gotten far better since BETA. Join back give it new go. 
---
Play once to try it. 
---
Play twice to understand it
---
Play thrice to enjoy it.
---
You are right, I thought you meant a toggle to be optional feature Bethesda might implement. 
---
But already they have gone to the direction where you can't vats everything you can and quite possibly want to damage.
---
If they were to change anything, would they really implement a toggle, classify al harmless prey animals, fogs ect. correctly as "neutral". Or would they just change these animals to all be neutral like Brahmin currently are.
---
Brahmin are big to spot and don't much benefit vats to kill. But for example the loose Red Rocket megastop bots  you need to kill to collect their cores, are initially neutral and can't be vatsed.
---
I fear if Bethesda makes any changes, they just make it all worse. Small critters, if and when you want to kill them, are difficult to spot from high grass. Not all of them even make sounds that you would know there is some in the area.
---
I did the same with that challenge, I was so fucking frustrated because I was trying to bring its health down and I kept overdoing it and accidentally killing the damned thing (Phillipi Battlefield Cemetery where it respawns on hop). Eventually I used a shitty pistol to whittle it down and just bashed it to death with the syringer lmao. Definitely using the grenade trick next time.
---
Thanks. If we're lucky, their ghosts will haunt Todd Howard long enough for him to add the feature that removes all friendly creatures from VATS. 
---
In the meantime, I unlocked the atom achievement for 50 critical shots, so I guess I'll stock up on disease cures and antibiotics for when the mole rats attack and stock up on more ammo for when the game decides my point blank, right on top of the enemy shots are only going to connect properly 100% of the time in VATS, and then stop using VATS altogether.
---
I dont have much time atm to compose a full reply but I'm also on Xbox at Suited_Skeleton and would love to team up with you. Im level 99 and have launched a few nukes before, im sure we could easily do it :)
---
Yes. Next
---
Agreed. The best advice for scrap/junk is go through your gear and see just what you really are using. And lower the scrap you aren’t using. For me bones, crystal, and lead aren’t too high on my need list so they sit at 30-50 a piece at all times.
---
Wavy Willards/Clarksburg area. Tons of violet flux.
---
It really does not work with wood since COLLECTING wood is what the game perceives as coming to a wood source and pressing the interaction key.
---
I see. Like I suspected, the automatic system can only try to identify trade posts to close them.
---
They could turn scrapped junk into a currency with a cap, and that would both decrease server load, and give us more useable stash space. 🤷‍♂️
---
My worry is everyone is an extremely high level
---
As much as I like this idea of creating a more spooky and dark environment for the mire, sometimes it's extremely hard to see in, especially at night and having to put my monitor's brightness at its maximum burns my eyes.
---
I am lvl 93, I think, so far it's a fun experience. Waiting for more, give me more Bethesda!
---
they're not rare, but you can make a quick fortune on the straight jackets. one run gives you nearly enough to reach your 1400 cap limit at the vendor bots. they're 45c each with maxed hard bargain and you can walk out with, like 20 of them in one pass.
---
and yes, colored asylum outfits are crazy expensive and rare to drop.

I love the bungalow. Using the rug to put my stuff on then placing rug and all inside.https://i.ibb.co/G5sDy4g/save-4.png
---
You can't kill something that is already dead. We are talking ways to revive at this point.
---
60 is really the max imo. As that’s when builds are mostly completed. Everything after that is just general and play. Don’t worry about everyone that’s high leveled. 
---
Most people of are harmless. Some just want to pick a fight and some of them just want to feel like top dog when someone has a workshop. Either way you as a new low level aren’t a problem. Hell many of them probably will/may drop stuff if you look new enough. 
---
As long as you just play you’ll catch up to that 60+ mark with ease. You might even make friend to make that leveling faster.
---
Well, it is doable, but it's definitely not that easy for two reasons: First, you gotta have some skill handling grenades since the mobs tend to run around and you'll miss a lot of shots if you won't time it right. Second, grenades are not that easy to acquire in the needed quantities when the mobs count for a challenge gets to 1000+.
---
Not trying to be a dick here and yes, this is a good advice for some emergency situations, but most of the time most people won't even have enough grenades to get even one of these challenges done.
---
Omg, I killed Mr. Veterenarian tabbing through scorched the other day. I was using a tesla, all the cats died too. I just logged, couldn't deal with the guilt.
---
Since when were to bottlecap mines removed? I remember crafting a bunch to clear the "Craft mines" challenge.
---
It is a 'live service'; by design it tries to minimise the 'I am too far behind' effect.
---
Arguably if you find the proposition enticing  now is a better time to pick it up than last November.
---
There is substantially more content at this point than there was at release, the level of polish is higher and the game can be picked up for a fraction of the price so you get a better entertainment deal for your money.
---
The game still has plenty of bugs but arguably the vast majority are of the 'cumulative effect' kind that grind you down over an extended period of time.
---
In my humble opinion the game was a misfire and there is room for improvement but that doesn't mean that is a write-off; there is still fun to be found in it. At the current asking price quite a lot to be fair.
---
Moreover despite setbacks, backlash and various controversies the publisher has not cut it loose yet. Not sure if endearing or foolhardy but in this day an age that is a rarity. The EAs and Activisions of the world would have long ago let it wither and die.
---
But I digress; yes, all things considered and in the current context is worth the asking price.
---
As someone who was randomly given a fully kitted level 50 T-60 set after buying a mutation for 300 caps, I salute you and anyone who helps out the community.
---
I’ll take out Marie, you take out Pompy.  Cross-cross.  Eliminate the motive, establish an alibi.
---
Yea! And if you get on Xbox feel free to add me. I'll show you the ropes
---
&gt;You are right, I thought you meant a toggle to be optional feature Bethesda might implement. 
---
Ideally, I would like it to be toggleable, but I also know that if they do put the feature in without a toggle option, it wouldn't be the first time Bethesda has put in a feature that's non-optional when most players would prefer it be optional. Me, personally, I wish I could toggle dailys, because once I've done them once, I don't typically have any interest in them showing up in my Pipboy again. 
---
As for the Red Rocket bots, I've only done that mission once and they didn't start out neutral for me, so I'm honestly surprised they show up neutral for others at the start. On the other hand, I was in a team at the time, so maybe my teammates shot them before I saw them and that automatically made them hostile to me. I was under the impression they were malfunctioning like the farmhands do in their one quest and needed to be put down and then have the cores removed to be reset properly, so it seems to me they should be hostile through the entire quest and not just after you shoot them once. Could be wrong though. If not wrong, however, then Bethesda needs to fix those bots so they show up as properly hostile. I wonder if they aren't possibly bugged like certain scorchbeasts, since I've been attacked by multiple scorchbeasts now that showed as non-hostile the entire time so I was unable to VATS them. 
---
&gt;I fear if Bethesda makes any changes, they just make it all worse.
---
Wish I could say you're probably wrong, but the more I play Bethesda games and FO76 in particular, the more I'm painfully aware how right you are. My relationship with Bethesda has become quite a love/hate relationship over the last year. Really sucks that any time I play a Bethesda game on a platform where it can be modded, the first mod I have to get is the bug fix one. 
---
&gt;Small critters, if and when you want to kill them, are difficult to spot from high grass. Not all of them even make sounds that you would know there is some in the area.
---
Exactly why it should be a toggle feature. Even though most of the time that I'm playing the game, I don't want to shoot non-hostiles in VATS, when Meat Week rolls around is when I'm glad I can shoot non-hostiles in VATS. Otherwise there's no way I'd have any squirrel bits for the cooking event. Squirrels aren't as dodgy as molerats are, but they hide in the grass really well.
---
It helps, but not much for the perk cost really.
---
Changing floor tiles can eat up budget. After they have been placed if you go in and edit to a different style it appears to dupe them budget wise.
---
The pipes after you registered your DNA?
---
I sold 2 salty tenders for 1000 caps each. Just glad to have 68 pounds out of my stash.
---
This happened to me with the Valley Galleria location for the tourist quest, so you definitely aren't the only one who was left baffled by the photo mode. Ended up taking two pictures before it registered properly. The one that registered properly looks stupid and the one that didn't register properly is the one that actually looks like a picture taken by a tourist, of course.
---
I get the stable flux kinda junk from time to time
---
There are ammo vending Machines. Just turn those into exchanges
---
100% the best post ive seen on here
---
No idea. The last time I saw it was in the Savage Divide. My buddy who is almost level 200 had never seen it before when it spawned. He was running around with his camera taking pictures rather than trying to kill it lol.
---
No idea why my items aren't selling.  Did a lot of legendary farming during Meat Week, and I've got vending machines overflowing with 2 and 3-star legendaries.  I've got some of my top tier 3-star weapons going for 1,900 - 2,500 caps.  3-star armor on sale for 999 - 1200 caps.  
---
Nothing. No movement.  Sitting in there for days.  And my CAMP is right there between Whitespring Station and Blackwater Mine.  high traffic area, I sometimes have 4-5 people shopping at once.  Stimpaks, ammo, chems, bulk junk sells like hotcakes. But my legendaries get passed over.
---
I visit other CAMPs and see people with legendaries priced for 5,000 - 10,000 Caps.  Holy crap.  I'm asking for 70-80% less and I'm not selling anything. 
---
I assume everyone else in the FO76 community also went hammer-time during Meat Week and the market is oversaturated with legendaries at the moment? I'm to the point where I have over 40-50 legendary items in my stash/vending machines and I'm carrying 25 more.  I've scrapped some of the trash legendaries for scrip and I'm still overencumbered with 2 &amp; 3 star stuff to where I can't do much since I can't fast travel because I have so much legendary shit.
---
Should I cut prices even more? Or just wait a few weeks and see if the legendary market adjusts again?
---
I just get rid of all the stuff i dont use then move all my lead steel and gunpowder onto another character, then make ammo on a different character and it saves around 300 space
---
Yes. If you're starting from scratch, then there's a good amount of content to play through.
---
Even better, the Wastelanders expansion will be out before you run out of things to do.
---
I’ve honestly not had too many. The way it handles quests/exp/loot within a team continues to baffle me and makes no sense but other than that I’ve had barely any disconnects or other major bugs.
---
Would be an interesting nw mode
---
Not a legendary effect unless you consider mutations to be legendary effects for your body, but I was looking at mutations today and I'm thinking the adrenal mutation is probably extra powerful for bloodied builds. If you don't have that mutation already and you're okay with having mutations, I would definitely look into it. 
---
I forget what the negative effect for it is supposed to be, but there's always the class freak perk card for that, so... 
---
Again, just a suggestion, and I know it's not a legendary effect, but I don't see it discussed much when people talk about bloodied builds, so I figured I'd put it out there. I don't personally run a bloodied build, so if my suggestion is stupid, I welcome any bloodied builds who use mutations to come tell me how awful the adrenal mutation is for that build.
---
Lol yeah no point talking to folks like that. I am glad that I got into it this late because I think they’ve done good work and fixed a lot of the issues. Plus wastelanders is just about to come out too!
---
Yeah
---
Tbh I wouldn’t quite class it as NW. It could fit under the same menu as a “gamemode” but in its core it’s not NW.
---
You still have a few rooms to go before you get to the launch system.
---
I, too, would like to know what a mine hack is. Is it another thing I need to watch out for with griefers?
---
Today a scorched mob got me and I died right after the queen died. Respawed and got my paper bag with 3 items but none stable flux. Felt bad thinking someone else picked through it but i guess nobody did after all. Thanks
---
Power plant workshops produce the said full cores. Nothing more to say.
---
It sounds kinda like GMOD:Trouble in Terrorist town.
---
Or maybe even just an express option when you try en quit the gane after you die, just asking you “quit to main menu” or “start new match” so that way you dint even have to go and load the vault “lobby” instead it just shows you the deployment map and yer team
---
It does a bit. I never got to experience the GMOD scene so that’s lost on me but I feel ya.
---
This subreddit seems to yoyo with that. You praise 76 one day and you can be downvoted into oblivion. The next day, you have to insult 76 in order to be downvoted into oblivion. 
---
Heck, I've seen it yoyo fast enough for it to change from one post to the next in the exact same day within minutes of each other. 
---
Then some times you can say something middle of the road and get downvoted into oblivion because the people who loathe 76 and the people who adore 76 are both offended that you aren't reacting to 76 exactly the same way they do. 
---
Some days, you just can't win on this subreddit. 
---
Better stock up on headache chems while you can. ;)
---
I get what ur saying. Really. Have you tried to complete any of the tadpole/possum photo requirements recently? I've played since beta, I understand how it works. Trying to complete for my second character but recently they stopped accepting them. If anyone has been able to mark complete like in the last week or two on xbox, let me know.
---
Randomly chosen terrorist/infected. The terrorist’s job is to kill the innocent ones. The innocents’ job is to kill the terrorist. I’ve never played it either but I watch it on Achievement Hunter. 😊
---
&gt;As for the Red Rocket bots, I've only done that mission once and they didn't start out neutral for me, so I'm honestly surprised they show up neutral for others at the start. On the other hand, I was in a team at the time, so maybe my teammates shot them before I saw them and that automatically made them hostile to me.
---
They turn hostile once you get close enough for each. They kinda should be hostile straight from start.
---
I don’t wanna sound like an elitist prick but I don’t need anyone killing gnats hitting me. If you want to do the queen, get armor pen and do enough damage on her and get yourself some loot. 
---
I’m not making a YouTube video on kill time. Go get some loot. My lvl 30 girlfriend with an armor piercing fire axe mod does enough queen damage to get loot.
---
Just as I wrote it. Just different scenario. Still works 👍
---
Problem with that is if you scrap a wall that, lets say cost 10 concrete and 5 steel, you'll scrap for 2 concrete and 1 steel, you know? It's just.... wack.
---
Gotcha. I think there was always someone in my team who was much closer to them than I was before I'd spot them (hazards of having a kid on your team who's low level and thinks they can take on the world). Definitely agree with you that they should be hostile straight from the start. I guess Bethesda doesn't want us sneak sniping them or something.
---
The mutated ones would win alone with chameleon and marsupial lol.
---
Nah. No mutations. Limited PA, just you and some rando to watch your back.
---
Edit: but I feel ya on that. I just did a few match’s in NW and holy hand grenades.
---
You were far from being about launching a nuke lol
---
I'll make you a left leg. PM me your username.
---
Lol i kill the idiot bot when i see it.
---
So much for thinking I could replace my house with the bungalow to save on budget. On the other hand, interior walls so I can use wallpapers properly instead of being forced to place double walls would save a lot of budget and I'll be pleasantly surprised if they ever implement that feature any time soon.
---
People are just hurling great PvP ideas left and right like this. I hope a couple stick over at Bethesda!
---
???
---
It's worth the money when you consider how time you can spend enjoying yourself. However if you haven't already played/purchased a game like the witcher 3 or something then better to spend your money/time there. You get what I mean?
---
I just saw it! What a relief!
---
What a shame that the solution to this problem needs to come from the community instead of Bethesda! Cheers to the developer of this mod ;)
---
The one time i used it i placed the bungalow down then placed foundations around it as you start placing the foundations inside the bungalow it will levatate above the foundations.then slap down walls and a roof around the edges.
---
Yep I'm looking forward to it
---
Making things weightless would allow dupers to make insane amounts of stuff witch would break the game.
---
This, plus the only doors in my house that are locked are the ones to the upstairs where my family sleeps. All you're going to find if you pick those locks is two bedrooms, a bathroom, and the upstairs porch. Which is nothing new considering my house already has a second bathroom downstairs and a porch with four sleeping bags in it for camp visitors to use. In fact, my upstairs porch is smaller than my downstairs porch. My stash box is available to the general public, as are all my workbenches. Only workbench that may be blocked is the power armor station that's in my garage behind a rolling door, and that's only going to happen if a mole rat ate the power for the door. I've also got a faucet for people to make boiled water, a large purifier that's unlocked, and I leave my junk collector unlocked when I'm not low on scrap.
---
Blowing up cars in Whitesprings can kill other players even with pacifist enabled. Happened to me many times. People usually do this to prevent others from clearing an certain area before them.  Idk if it counts as an environmental damage or not but happens a lot and is one of the few things in this game that “just works”.
---

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive.

---
They don't? Didn't know that :/.
---
Edit, wikid it. They do stack. So :/.
---
lol I never spent money on anything, as difficult as that may be for you to believe. And in fact, I only ever obtained a single three-star item during my short time playing, one which I quickly discarded for scrip because the item didn't really suit me. And, yet, despite being under-equipped, not to mention under-leveled in comparison to fellow players (I began with a level 5 character and never made it to level 40 due to survival mode's removal), I still was able to thoroughly enjoyed my time.
---
And how is that? How could that possibly be? After all, I surely couldn't have been able to run in, guns blazing, while jumping around like Rambo on mars and actually score any kills, could I? At least not without being on an even playing field with my opponents, right? That is, not without having the best guns. Not without having god-tier armor. Right?
---
Well, you'd be correct in thinking I couldn't do that.Which is why, perhaps, I didn't do that. The real question is, why anyone be so stupid to think they could do that? Perhaps furthermore, how would anyone find something something so easy enjoyable? Well, I've already written in this regard, haven't I?
---
You see, one the one hand you have the people who live for the herculean struggle of taking on a juggernaut with nothing but the few weapons they've salvaged--who revel in the thrill and anxiety of not knowing what giant lies in wait to crush them around the corner as they crawl stealthily face down in the mud, hoping to catch any would-be nemesis unawares and topple them with superior strategy and skill--or, perhaps, to simply survive. 
---
While on the other hand, you have your typical, weak, halo-fan-type herd animal who merely wants to run around and get some easy kills with his "skills" (by which he means something like reflexes and aim and the ability to jump around, and by which he also means to exclude skill in strategically positioning oneself or selecting an appropriate weapon or perks), just so that he can feel a little bit better about how pathetic he is in real life.
---
And while we may be equally sorry for one another and others like ourselves, I suspect my sympathy for you, and those like you, and your common condition is more justified, considering low I.Q. tends to predict a lower rate of success in all areas of life, but...let's not dwell on that.
---
Oh, and by the way, since you obviously don't know, so called "auto-aim" (by which I'm sure you means VATS) can be countered with cryo weapons. I'd say you're welcome, but you obviously aren't bright enough to put that knowledge to any real use.
---
I mean you already can unlock the doors, so unless shooting the doors down never made you wanted, I'm not sure what the difference is. Besides, as I said before, there's nothing in my locked second floor that isn't already available to you on the first floor. Heck, my first floor porch is nicer than the one on the second floor (and yes I did lock the door on the second floor porch for any marsupials who want to see where my family sleeps like the Peeping Toms they are). No shade against marsupials in general. I had that mutation for a bit, myself. Still, my family would like some privacy while we sleep, thanks.
---
So we'll create a ton of teams and all go in and take her out.  Then we'll handle the fallout together.  The whole building will die because of her l.
---
Loathe her!!
---
Pompy killed a Yao guai and saved a child all by himself, likely while gently berating the bear for still being a tadpole. He could probably eat a Mr Gutsy for a light snack. Good luck.
---
Unfortunately not :( and the reason is what you stated. Your console cant keep up with speed demon alone so if it stacked with all the other shit it would just blue screen probably lol
---
&gt;Another thing I’d love to see added is interior walls. The Atom Shop wallpapers are great— easily one of my favorite CAMP customization items in game. However, because we can’t apply them to both sides of a wall, I’m stuck with a few areas inside my camp where there’s wallpaper on one side of a room but not the other. Double-sided interior wall pieces (or just enabling wallpaper for use on both sides of the current pieces) would make things look a lot cleaner and more even. 
---
Sweet baby camp budget, would I love to see this implemented! There's a way someone posted on this subreddit not long after wallpapers came out that you can use to double up your walls so you get the effect of wallpapers on both sides, but those extra walls eat up so much budget in my camp and my house isn't even all that large to begin with.
---
Scariest thing is spawning into an area doing the environmental data quest and getting the Mothman sound effect and then him trying to wipe you off the face of the earth as soon as you get control of your toon.
---
Most blue screens I get are at the train stations, either trying to sell, or changing my perks. Things just don't load up fast enough, so I have to sit for a minute and wait for the game to catch up.
---
Yeah haha it takes a while after fast traveling for the game to catch up
---
Now that’s a pose!
---
Depends. I had someone begging me a couple days ago to team up with them to launch a nuke because they'd died four times already to all the robots. Ignoring the fact I was a lower level than them even, I would have helped them out, but I don't yet have the clearances myself to get into the launch rooms, so I couldn't help them.
---
I had dead Scorchbeasts drop from the sky regularly when hunting them for the community event. One of them spawned in my CAMP, got stuck in the wall and then hung from the side of my house like one of them mounted heads.
---
I dunno maybe get a good internet? Didn't run into back to back disconnects after that duping glitch got patched. Who knows? Maybe there's new dupes out there that involve server crashing
---
That’s the west key. I’m talking about the east key.
---
Red will fetch you like max caps or insane trades, pinks less than that, and yeah brown and green I’ve seen sell anywhere from like 1.5 to 4K — have never seen a yellow, blue, pink, forest in vending machines so can’t comment on how much those go for.
---
If it is, best of luck to any low levels who want a workshop or two of their very own. 
---
On a related note, I got to watch a super high level person fight a pretty fresh out of the vault, low level kid for their workshop in a low level area while the kid was nearly crying into their microphone because they'd worked so hard to get that workshop in the first place. Now I definitely don't agree with children playing M rated games to begin with (speaking as someone currently stuck having to babysit a random strangers kid on Fallout so at least someone out there is teaching the kid some gaming etiquette), but who the heck hurt you as a child that you now feel the need to make other children cry over a workshop in a video game?!
---
The mire is honestly my favorite region in 76 the feel is totally different in there, though I wish it was creepier and more like point lookout
---
Which choice did ya find it at? Or entirely somewhere else?
---
Optional quest markers for killed enemies. At least up to a certain number, like the last twenty enemies, each successive one replaces the first, if you get my meaning.
---
The amount of loot I lost to the high grass and trenches in the Bog could fill a stash box on its own...
---
Depends on the specific legendary effect but most the time the legendary stuff is way better. Pop some pills or unyielding armor on to boost your intelligence or pay someone on the market to mod it for you
---
The questing and exploration parts of the game are really best done solo anyway—so however high level other people are really doesn’t matter. The other players on the map don’t really impact you aside from the fact that some will randomly show up and give you stuff. 
---
By the time you’ve completed all of that and are really ready to regularly team up with people, get into any PvP stuff etc., you’ll be leveled up too. 50 is max level, beyond that is just for tweaking your build. So you’re not really much lower than anyone else for very long. 
---
For all the things Bethesda got wrong with this game, one thing they did manage to do well was create a shared world that you could play in as you see fit. For the most part, other players can be as big or as small a part of your experience as you like. 
---
Just avoid workshops, those are the PvP hotspots and you won’t be able to compete there until you’ve got your build down. Assuming you’d even want to—most players don’t.
---
They have Preston’s outfit in the atom shop already. I don’t see how Kellogg’s would be a lore issue.
---
Juicehead makes both a valid and invalid points with his argument on fo4 skins being in 76 while they are kinda pricey the DLCs are free unless we wanna pay for DLCs we better be happy with that 8 dollar jacket
---
No, you don't get the flux from the body, it's an event reward.
---
restarted 20 times in a half an hour. damn.
---
amazing thread my man
---
FIOS is considered good? Just wondering if anybody else has been having the same problem.
---
High perception, high luck, high agility. From Stealth, my hunter can cause close to 1500 damage with an instigating which says 129 on the Pipboy. 
---
However, it seems the crossbow suffers when distance Is big and you hit armoured enemies. Great damage loss. 
---
And you need Vats.
---
Personally I'd keep the Instigating one. It's imo the most useful effect for a sniper rifle, since it'll one-shot most enemies you'll come across, except maybe the Sheepsquatch and Scorchbeasts. Or gulpers. 
---
Of course the anti-armor one would be better for fighting the Queen, but not so much for the everyday killing.
---
I haven't seen it yet, and I've only got fleeting glimpses of the mothman as well. My main has over 60 levels, you're just rolling good on rng I guess.
---
That is the Grafton monster. In the wild I have seen level 10 and level 30 ones. The one that spawns for Queen of the Hunt is level 40 and we got a level 80 one for primal cuts.
---
Even make it so you can scrap ammo you don't need.
---
She wants you to draw her like one of your french girls
---
I sent you a friend request, you will probably have to logout and back in to accept it, I will be on for just a short while.
---
“Up to a certain amount of each type” so like if you have 500 wood it’s weightless but that 501st one will have weight that will contribute to the stash
---
Sincerely appreciate it! She's in shock. Had no idea what was happening right next to her.
---
Yeah, sure mate. Maybe it's time to pay for a better internet provider.
---
Bring back survival mode or something. 
---
Would also be nice if these people got stuck on servers solely with other people their own level so they're forced to pick on people their own size, but these people don't like being reminded that they were once level one as well, so the moment you do that to them, they'll scream about how you're ruining the game for them, all while they completely ignore how much they're ruining the game for others who just barely left the vault and are already being slaughtered by people for whom killing low levels is no challenge whatsoever. 
---
I mean maybe it's just me, but doesn't going around in an area where you're one shotting everything in sight get boring pretty quickly? I tend not to fast travel to locations any more unless I have a team mate there I can fast travel to for free, so when I'm walking through an area with enemies I can one shot, I tend to just keep walking. Wouldn't you get a whole lot more fun out of doing PVP with someone who will actually present a challenge to you? 
---
And to the people who say they shoot low levels because they're playing as raiders, if you're genuinely doing this stuff to be a raider, you'll also fight people your own level (and higher). Otherwise you're shooting low levels so you can be a jerk to people you don't have to worry about seeing tomorrow morning.
---
 It is a pleasure to make someone happy.
---
I hunt super mutants for their weapons then scrap them with the scrapper perk card to get a lot of steel. West-tec, Huntersville, Summerville, and Horizon's Rest are some good places to find super mutants.
---
Same here I'm really excited about wastelanders and i really hope they start info dumping soon.      I've kept playing since beta and i really like the game alot.  I log on atleast once a day for several hours.    There has been a couple times i've been really upset with either how they communicated or "didn't" or how everything seemed to be 2 steps forward and 3 steps back.    or the other myriad of other things that have happened but i honestly just have gotten mad out of love for the game and i do really enjoy it though.      I really hope they hit wastelanders out of the park because i know how great this game is!  Can! and will be.
---
Seriously wish they'd bring back Survival, both because griefers have gone through the roof in Adventure mode now that Survival is gone and also because I never got to do Survival mode myself. I wanted to do the story in Adventure mode and then move to Survival and now that Survival is gone, I won't get to do that.

Fallout 76 for PS4 is £20 , fallout 4 is £14, these are for the discs on amazon.
---
My first character has been around since day 1 as good as she is it's time for her to retire and settle down, started a new character yesterday gonna try to spend my peek points more wisely.
---
Looks like challenge! Beth - can you make it official?
---
Except for endgame enemies, you will probably be fine.  You can easily carry golf bags worth of weapons, use it when it is appropriate if you enjoy it.
---
Unfortunately I can't change the title at this point, only the content below the title, or I would fix the word mistake. Guess I can add an edit to the other part of the post to fix the title that way. 
---
That being said, it would be nice if we could toggle VATS so we aren't inadvertently killing creatures that have no intention of killing us. Then people who want to kill foxes can keep the feature toggled off and people like myself who don't want to kill foxes can have the feature toggled on. When Meat Week rolls around and I need squirrel bits for the cookout, I'll temporarily toggle off the feature.
---
Super simple and everyone's happy. 
---
On the other hand, I've been attacked by multiple scorchbeasts the game has marked as not hostile so I can't hit them in VATS, so I wouldn't be surprised that, if they implemented a feature to save the foxes, it'd bug out regularly and people who don't want to kill foxes in VATS would still end up killing them in VATS while the feature is turned on.
---
I was able to handle it with 2H melee around level 36. I had a huge swarm of them and took them into the dumb lobby and waited for them to come through the door - chokepoint.
---
You’ve never played a Fallout game, yet this one is boring and glitchy. Two thumbs up.

Or like what if the damage remained about the same but targeting a limb would guarantee a crippled crock pot. Like the enemy is guaranteed to cripple a limb, allowing for you or teammates to strategize offense and defense accordingly

I use a vampires exploding gatling as my main weapon. Deals great damage, heals me at the same time and is very ammo efficient. Named it “Ol’ Reliable”.

The reason why I bring up bullying at all isn't to dismiss your frustrations towards cheaters. We all get that. Nor is it to demean you as a person. Absolutely not my goal.
---
It's just in description of what you're proposing in your post, plain and simple.
---
Look up the definition yourself if you don't agree with me. When you do (if at all) you'll see that bullying isn't "a bullshit term that parents made up because they gave their kids everything they wanted and didn't teach them to stand up for themselves". It's a very old term. Not surprising because the notion of bullying is hardly a new thing.
---
Nor is it even limited to kids. Adults get bullied. Adults can get bullied by children. It's just a misuse of ones power to be mean and demean someone.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;You're telling me that we shouldn't "pick on the poor little people that are cheating" because it would be bullying them?
---
Yes. That's precisely what I'm suggesting. 
---
What good will come of the misuse of the social power of the sub to demean and belittle cheaters? What is your end game?
---
Is it to stop them from cheating? If that is truly your goal, then I told you what the more effective remedy is - keep on Bethesda (in a fair and polite way of course) to actual put more effort into dealing with the issue, since Bethesda are the actual ones with the power to remove people's accounts.
---
Or is your goal more to take your frustrations out on the cheaters and make yourself feel better by belittling them and shaming them publically?
---
In your own words, "They are the ones that should be shamed and to use your term, bullied".
---
You're the bully here bud. I'm not saying this to demean or belittle you. Just look at your own words. "Grow up and get thicker skin". Really dude?
---
I just feel sorry for you that you're the kind of person that feels that bullying is ok, irrespective of the circumstances. Like because they cheated that it justifies your attempt to bully them in turn.
---
Try to be a better person AND do the more effective. Get Bethesda to do their job to stop the cheaters. Yeah, they can never deal with all the cheaters. However, it's the more effective than naming and shaming cheaters on a sub that they may never see.
---
&gt;You might even make friend to make that leveling faster.
---
Bonus points for them if they're willing to share perk cards like "Inspirational."
---
at this point even Bethesda will agree pve is the focus of the game, not pvp. the vast majority of people play adventure exclusively with a hint of NW. survival was so barren you'd go there for a better vault 94 raid, that's how bad it is.
---
I know you ragechronicles types like to namecall people "carebears" to try and get a reaction out of them but at the end of the day you're just a second-class citizen, there's more money to be made from campers who buy junk off the atom store.
---
Fallout 76 provides a terrible competitive experience anyhow, I don't know what got you all so upset in the first place. most engagements are over within a couple seconds. not to mention survival servers were inherently broken.
---
be glad you still got workshops.
---
Giggidy.
---
You mean the green boxes? Just put ammo in the displays. Depending on the ammo (and maybe amount? Idk) it shows a box I think
---
How...Just..How?!
---
Nawh there is like a junk or misc item called like “.308 casing”
---
Whenever she tells me I eat roadkill, I make it a point to sell her the grossest foods in my inventory.
---
This, and also make the perk cards for reducing weight effect your stash.
---
Oh ok I didn't know. But I'm sure I had one of those green metal cases in a display when I added ammo. But I forgot which type and how much I put there.
---
Guaranteed every time? I told her it's her one and she's gotta be careful with it.
---
But then what happens when you take off the perk card and your stash is over the limit?
---
I could see that working if they renamed the clothes. Like yeah we know them as their outfits but who knows if someone else wore it first or came up with it on their own
---
I thought it was possible to kill people in this mode with poison or fire damage?

Do you know where ?

Nope. It doesn't

I already seen +1000 2-3 months ago on PS, i was shocked!

Other than my bloodied guy that uses nerd rage, I'm not sure of anything else to use for intelligence other than demo expert. Gunsmith maybe... can't even justify putting int over 5 so I usually use demo on my other chars. Any advice is welcome though

Are you melee or ranged and are you using vats?
---
Can other players grief and kill him?
---
Thats funny / like the archer badge I think u had to kill 50 enemies with crossbow/. I ran out of bolts I was at new gad with low level scorched and I ended up using the gun-but attack and it counted lol
---
That's just plain crazy!
---
&gt;there's more money to be made from campers who buy junk off the atom store.
---
Can't exactly say that Bethesda viewing us as walking wallets is much better than the poor attempt at insulting people who like to be nice by calling them "carebear normies." For the first, I'm more than happy to not spend any more money in the Atom Shop. For the second, calling me a nice, normal person isn't exactly my definition of an insult, much less a clever one.
---
PVP would probably be a whole lot better if people shot others their own level, but I have yet to ever see that happen in Adventure mode. It's always some high level player going to a low level area workshop and shanking some low level player in the back before they even have the notification that the workshop is being contested. Much challenge. Such difficult. Very almost didn't survive initiating combat with another person.
---
Poseidon has 3 or more, I would assume all the power plants do

Someone said they needed the rug glitch for the fusion generator but I can place it fine in my bungalow along with the PA workstation.
---
Just wish the bugs were consistent at least lol
---
I don't know. I think opposums, including real life ones, are kind of those ones that are so ugly that they cross over the line into cute territory. My heart hurts every time I ever see a real one dead in the middle of the road. Poor thing was just living its life, eating pests, and got hit by a car it probably didn't see coming.
---
And, yes, RIP Grahms BBQ. I made sure to take a picture of him near the end of the week, stirring some food in one of his cooking pots, so that now he shows up on my loading screen on occasion.
---
Mostly melee and ranged independently at the current time, as my two nice junkie weapons are a knife and heavy weapon. My build is easily rotated around, I can run melee, shotgun, heavy, and rifle well. VATS is used plenty, but not specced beyond concentrated fire 3, have other cards in luck, but only 3 points available for use after mutation cards. Also stealth when I'm not using a high fire rate weapon.
---
Five Minutes into "Screech and Kill" and she gives you that look.
---
I'd say buy it, with all the discounts for this game and what content there is, it's worth 30/40 dollars 
---
Plus in a month we get wastelanders which promises even more so getting it now to learn the map, get gear etc would be best option

How do u even?

If you use a lot of melee I suggest staying away from stuff that reduces strength.

Good to know, and great link, thanks a bunch!

Honestly that’s the main reason I don’t play NW much. The lobby/matchmaking system is so slow compared to the fast paced nature of the match. Even if I make it to the final five, I feel like it was over so fast and then I have to wait to queue up again.
---
Do you know if this can be fixed by storing and replacing? If so, I may have to do that with my camp to see how much budget all my tiled floors can free up.
---
Never seen a flatwoods monster before... And im at lvl 110 :p
---
I think that depends a whole lot on your build. I have healing factor and am definitely thankful for the class freak perk since my rad resist perk card seems to be doing squat. But then I also have grounded and since I don't use energy weapons, the negative effect of the mutation doesn't actually effect me at all.
---
Play Rust
---
The game needs real npcs and faction based content
---
I want to be a glowing one so badly.
---
Played a fallout multiplayer mod before and my back story was a glowing one desert ranger that could control ghoul armies lol
---
This could be fun, but I wonder how they'd show certain mutations like the ones I have. Are we going to have a lightning rod growing out of my head because I'm grounded and a stimpak permanently attached to my arm because I have healing factor? 
---
Also, if they're going to do this, maybe put it in the character creation menu so we have the option of if we want the mutation to show or not. Then, if we want it to show, we open the character creation menu and select which active mutations we want visible. 
---
For immersion purposes, have it so those who aren't showing their mutations have the mutation work on the original level and those who have the mutation showing are more mutated/farther along in the mutation process and therefore the mutation works stronger for them. If I have to sacrifice the original look of my character (which I personally wouldn't do, but still), there should be some payoff at least.
---
Then survival for you will always be a mystery unsolved lol. I never got to try it either tho.
---
&gt;I think that depends a whole lot on your build.
---
It's a disproportionately high amount of buffs for a very small point investment. That's why almost everyone is a mutant in this game.
---
&gt; the negative effect of the mutation doesn't actually effect me at all.
---
With Class Freak, the negative effects are miniscule anyway. Hence the "big pros, few cons."
---
Unfortunately, but it looks like I'm not alone, so maybe enough of us missing out can get Bethesda to bring it back. I've seen a couple people saying it might come back after Wastelanders is released. That would be nice, especially if having Wastelanders released can free up more time for the team to focus on making Survival a good mode.
---
I don't know the whole lore behind the flatwoods monster but from what I do know it's another form of alien species that came to the earth at some point. Would be cool if he had a new form of the alien blaster or some form of rifle. Correct me if I'm wrong on the lore it was from an Oxhorn video a while ago.
---
Bring everyone together for Wastelanders then separate the casual from the harcore again. Makes sense.
---
There has been several  xp glitches. Those guys probably sat and disarmed a trap for half a day
---
You talk to them?
---
I was the same way i was like i am not getting any of them mutations because i wanted to be pure.      then i got the marsupial one on accident.      now i am up to 5 mutations.
---
One of my team mates called her that by mistake and it's just kind of stuck and we all call her that now 😅
---
I mean I got rid of my marsupial mutation because I didn't like the intelligence debuff (and am also way too used to climbing Skyrim mountains), but like I said, depending on your build, the class freak perk card is very much worth the three perk points it takes up. Almost everyone is a mutant in this game, but very few have every mutation applied to their build and I've seen quite a few recommendations for the class freak perk for people who do play mutation builds.
---
Nah I just a screen shot of them.
---
&gt;I mean I got rid of my marsupial mutation because I didn't like the intelligence debuff 
---
Repair perks fix that. So does SBQ. I've got hundreds of repair kits just sitting there.
---
&gt;the class freak perk card is very much worth the three perk points it takes up.
---
That's what I said. Five points (two in starched genes, three in class freak) = disproportionately huge benefit.
---
Sure, you can *choose* not to. You can also choose to use a Stalker's Minigun.
---
&gt;I've seen quite a few recommendations for the class freak perk for people who do play mutation builds. 
---
It's worth it with most builds. That's my point.
---
Its like GTA online where you login and every person on your phone starts calling you for some bullshit

At this point, I’m not sure which I’ve heard more, the Grafton mayor when I log in, or posts on this sub about the Grafton mayor.

Haha! That makes me so happy! I'm putting a code on my secret room just in case and only going to let my friends in to screw with them. I'm new at games and this glitch and death trap I've discovered has made my day. My buds are serious gamers and don't know about this yet and it's going to seriously fuck up their day. No more being called noob. Super Noob from here on.
---
Well Preston outfit ressembled some of the cowboy outfits in Nuka World, which are pre-war, and the Minutemen General outfit was an independance war outfit, so those can fit into the world. Only Maxson's coat is weird
---
Well if you think about it, not a lot of lore was broken, only a few things. Also because they broke it one or two times doesnt mean they should break it more
---
This would have made grahms cook out pretty much impossible
---
I replied before I saw your edit. 
---
That being said, not having unlimited perk points means you have to be careful where you put your perk points, even with card swapping. While there are many other places I could use those three points to help my build a lot, the class freak perk card makes the three points it takes up worth the investment. If the negative effects of mutations weren't that bad, I could very easily put those three points to use elsewhere and just learn to deal with the negative effects of the mutation, but since my rad resist card doesn't seem to do anything anyway, I really cannot afford to have the full effect of the chems debuff that my healing factor mutation gives. 
---
Even with class freak, I'm having to use a perk card that reduces the amount of weight that chems take up because otherwise I'll be overencumbered with the additional amount of chems I have to carry to counteract the chem debuff, so even with class freak, I'm still being held back in certain areas because of my mutation. I enabled traveling pharmacy and now have to be careful about other stuff I carry in my stash so that those things don't overencumber me. I'm making quite a few sacrifices for my mutations that wouldn't be worth the sacrifice at all if the perks of the mutations were weaker or the debuffs even stronger. 
---
And as I said before, the mutations can't all be all that wonderful compared to their negative effects or there'd be a whole lot more people playing with all of the mutations in their build. There's plenty of mutations I skip out on because the perk is super handy but the debuff isn't worth it. It very much depends on the build. Make mutations too negative and then you'll have no one wanting to use them in their build.

I did say it should be a feature that can be toggled in settings for this exact reason. Mentioned Meat Week even, exactly because I used VATS on squirrels in that event on more than one occasion. Make it a feature you can toggle and then people who don't want to kill non-aggressive creatures but still want to use VATS on squirrels during Meat Week can turn the feature on when Meat Week isn't happening and then turn it off when Meat Week is happening.
---
They can barely keep servers stable... you really think they’ll be able to know what’s on the loot table if legit days ago they broke the purveyors loot table with the random pick and didn’t know the fix so they changed it to 25% off?
---
The cryolator being available is a bit of a shitshow.
---
The problem with the change to Brahmin is that if anything hostile is near them we can't VATS on to the hostile creature. This has been a problem in Free Range since that change. I wouldn't want this problem to expand because more creatures are treated like Brahmin.
---
Erbody out here assuming its gender an shit 🔫🤠

What does fo76edit do? Can you find weapons drops etc?

I love it too. Been in since beta, never uninstalled. But if they dont add a metric shit ton of cosmetics, camp items, and new weapons in wastelanders. I might have to chill. Ill play the story real quick.

---
My camp budget was at 15% used until the last update, now it’s at 80% and I haven’t built anything, it’s frustrating
---
&gt;Repair perks fix that. So does SBQ. I've got hundreds of repair kits just sitting there.
---
I don't have unlimited perk points, even with the ability to swap, so I can't just have every perk enabled that people say I should have. Mutations can also be acquired at any level, whereas not every level can handle SBQ. 
---
&gt;That's what I said. Five points (two in starched genes, three in class freak) = disproportionately huge benefit.
---
&gt;Sure, you can choose not to. You can also choose to use a Stalker's Minigun.
---
Again, don't have unlimited perk points, even with card swapping. Sacrifices have to be made somewhere.
---
&gt;It's worth it with most builds. That's my point.
---
I'm confused. Do you want mutations to have debuffs so strong that using class freak still doesn't help or are the debuffs in mutations strong enough that people have to find class freak a worthwhile investment to dedicate three points to that they could use in so many other ways than in the luck slot in general/on class freak specifically? Because it seemed to me like you said mutations have super pathetic debuffs, yet if they have such weak debuffs, why do people feel the need to use class freak then when they could be doing so many other things with those three perk points?
---
I was building a camp at Lake Eloise and had one spawn when I was fighting a Scorchbeast. I had never seen a Scorchbeast glow bright pink before, and then I heard the bastard teleport behind me.
---
&gt;Because it seemed to me like you said mutations have super pathetic debuffs, yet if they have such weak debuffs, why do people feel the need to use class freak then when they could be doing so many other things with those three perk points?

You can't read.

I play purely solo exploration. It is a very big map.  Most quests and challenges are lame imho.  Exception is mistress of mystery.  So turn on pacifist and server hop if you run into griefers and have a good time.
---
It seems like any suggestion to Bethesda for things to improve is a complete waste of time because they're apparently incapable of implementing an improvement without busting something else in the process, typically busting it so hard that the improvement addition was one step forward for Bethesda and five steps back instead of, at most, one step forward and one step back. 
---
Makes me wonder why any of us bother to suggest things to Bethesda. 
---
Makes me wonder why I even bother playing the game at this point. 
---
Definitely doesn't make me wonder why I stopped spending money in the Atom Shop.
---
My eyes!
---
If it's done correctly, a single line item in a list with item.qty data as a value.  The problem that would lend to instability is a generic increase in stash space lets you store more items not capable of being stored like that. Costumes, Items with CND (only stack when CND is exactly the same), Legendaries add another set of data to track.  Stash tracking + CAMP tracking + Personal Inventory + World object tracking + container respawn timer tracking, tracking all that mean tons of variables the server needs to load and adjust once a player connects.  It's why the last two stash increases were done one at a time and only in increments of 200 each.  Its why they had to set a sliding scale limit to personal inventory as well.  Used to be that you could carry unlimited amounts with minimal slowdown.  Now if you exceed a certain percentage over your current max carry weight, you cannot move at all.  The more stuff you have to track per player the greater the server load and more instability you introduce.  It's why any more stash or camp budget increases are unlikely to happen, or be minor if they do.  Stuff like player affect in world loot (placed or containered) can't be helped but player specific inventories can.
---
Lowering Junk weight wouldn't affect it much, however they most likely still wouldn't as limiting stored junk has an effect on the player loot cycle that keeps people playing.  To hunt legendaries, plans etc, you need gear, you need junk to build stuff from plans and maintain that gear.  Storing more junk means having to go out less times in the endgame after you've seen nearly everything.

Good code would make it so there is a single row that says you have 500 steel. 
---
Bad code would be having 500 rows that says "steel".
---
Both are possible.. as to what way it is implemented in fo76’s engine ? Who knows ! At this time it is not obvious to me that Bethesda has made the best design choices all the way ...
---
Thanks! I'll see what I can do!!
---
Grafton Steel has a lot, and run through Fort Defiance, making sure you grab EVERYTHING from every room. I walked out with over 500 peices of steel and plastic
---
I want to farm it quickly though
---
For shear variety i'd get fallout new vegas

It takes all the files and displays them for you to sift through. I have a basic understand of Python from a couple of modules on my maths degree and it seems to be following the same kind of logic as code.
---
Take the remains, and never deposit them. Then he shuts up forever.
---
Like you've got listings, then drop down into "Books" and you have plans for raider sturdy armour. Then that is referenced by raider armour loot lists, which is referenced by savage divide loot lists. So I can infer from that roughly (knowing that apparently they drop from there according to reddit posts) that the plans are a drop from events in the savage divide.
---
That's still a lot of f***ing hassle though, and in the same time it took me to do that I've talked to family AND done some strength exercises in my dorm room.
---
That's why I want to have a list to search.
---
No Male bat's can resist that legs lol
---
Or this is the internet where things can be easily misunderstood and I asked for some clarification because something clearly was misunderstood.
---
I'm not anything but a beginner to code. I study maths so there's something of a logical mindset but it's still not a proper understanding.
---
Are you saying that they've managed to code the game so that there are no easily extractable/editable loot lists with chances?
---
If having loot lists is difficult, why can other games do it? Or is this just a "if it's too complicated we can get away with it" kind of mentality like in the Big Short?
---
Also it should be able to be toggled off. Because seeing Marsupial, Speed Demon, Healing Factor, and Talons on my sweet poodle skirt wearing mini me would be horrific.
---
Lvl 92. Hanging out big time for Wastelanders. Super fucking pumped in fact aye.
---
AA with Stabilized doesnt stack too well, you gain around 36-38% damage bonus overall, which is not much. BFFR .50cal is a way to go. For higher health builds JFFR is good choice.
---
No
---
Ah, ok. Well let me know if you change your mind.
---
SBQ doesn't receive any explosive damage from a .50cal. A fire rate version is more effective on the queen. Explosive is good for the adds.
---
People seem to have a lot of weight issues with this game, but you're not supposed to horde 800 of every material.  It's very unlikely you're using every single material type, or even most of them.  If you're not using laser weapons then you're not using fiber optics or gold at all so those 400 stacks of those are useless for you.
---
If you want to keep some around just in case a CAMP item requires them, then just keep like 50 of each material and only go over for the few materials you regularly use.
---
They could show grounded by giving the character thick rubbery skin or maybe a visible layer of mucus that will protect the individual from energy damage. With plague walker the individual could have some rashes or visible signs of a disease that doesn't largely affect the player. With carnivore the individual could have sharper incisors and a lack of lips to grant the ability to open their jaws wider for better food intake, while with herbivore the individual could have broad flat teeth and strong jaws for grinding vegetation. although keep in mind these are just suggestions
---
I am stumped on regeneration though, but the rest could probably be solved by basing the mutations on the appearance of animals that have the genetics that allow it to function the same way the mutants do. 
---
I agree with your other point about how appearance affects the strength of the mutations.
---
It was fun in old school alien vs. Predator way before Cod
---
Still haven’t been able to find it for the achievement...

I am 100% for this as long as loot glows
---
I used to have my camp just south of the Mothman museum. He would spawn there all the time when I was low level, but I've not seen him for a very long time now. I would take a pot shot at him and he'd teleport away. I also had my camp on the savage divide, just outside Whitesprings, and saw the Mothman there a few times, also at low level, he did the same thing, I'd take 1 shot and in a puff he'd vanish. I'm level 191, and I've never killed either one of them!
---
No their system is just shit. They really could make raw materials weightless. They would just have to change that these things don't count aus items, but just are displayed as a number. Make them as some kind of currency
---
Isn't that just direct messaging?

It prints a piece of paper for you to pickup and read in game.

Im assuming you are talking about the actual helmet and not the wetsuit mask which has helmet in the name? The helmet has never been availible through regular gameplay so it is doubtful that someone got a hold of one on either console. But if they did and you see one in a player vendor you can scrap it for 100% chance to learn the plans and bethesda has said they don't care.
---
I just want to confirm nothing has changed and its still a 100% plan learn rate, not too expensive to craft.
---
Not for me, last night got a blocking +1 Str Vampire golf club
---
I think that's not the problem of the game but a problem caused by some people (very asshole people) that just blows up the server. Because as I said on the post I only disconnect one time since November of 2018.
---
All the things you say like turning around fast, using workbenchs, traveling to other players camp's or having too many items didn't make my game crash, and I play on ps4 that has a worst hardware than a PC, the only thing I noticed is lag and that problem has a solution, open some ports on your router.
---
I hope that you can find a solution to your problem.
---
When you see that kind of stuff happening, just relog; you'll likely come back on a different server and the attackers will be gone. You may have to repair/replace a few items damaged prior to your relog, but it will have been contained.
---
Ah ok, thanks man.
---
Wait till wastelanders, that's going to be the one to watch and see if it's worth committing to and if the game has a long term future.
---
I like your idea for grounded with the thick rubbery skin. Definitely hadn't thought of that but it makes total sense and definitely isn't goofy like having a lightning rod come out of your head. 
---
Maybe for healing, they could give a bit of a yellow glow as if you're so healthy, you're a walking sunshine factory. Might mess with sneaking, though, since enemies pick up on Pipboy light so it's perfectly reasonable that they'd pick up on you radiating sunshine. 
---
No lips would definitely make me glad I haven't got the carnivore mutation. I tend to base RPG characters off of me for at least the first playthrough and I already don't have much of a mouth in real life. 😂
---
I know there's people out there who put a lot of effort into how their character looks, myself included, so if we're going to have visible mutations, making them optional would be appreciated by a lot of people and making it so that visible mutations also increase the effectiveness of the mutation would make sacrificing the characters looks worth it in the end. Plus, lore wise, it's not like super mutants were fully human one day and then looked the way they do now the very next day. Same for ghouls and scorched.

I nearly never go, so I didn't even realize where I was walking past until after he already started talking and I was so wishing I could load to a previous save and ask my teammates to take a different route than we were. Someone else mentioned that you can pick up the body and then just never bury it and that will shut him up for good. I'm going to be trying that the next time I'm on. Actually I'm first going to try talking to the curator and then not picking up the body, just in case it has some weight to it. If that doesn't work, I'll pick up the body, and hopefully it doesn't weigh anything or weighs very little.

Rug glitch is fine, but beware of "Needs support" bug
---
But i need mt extra agility eheh
---
I play on ps4 and I had the same problem, and I posted in a Bethesda forum, and a dev told me to open certain ports in my router, maybe you should do that too it worked for me
---
The _sole_ purpose of the single stair was to allow those without the "Frog Legs" perk card, to access the next tier above them. It's merely a better-than-nothing "consolation prize", for when you don't have the perk.
---
I walked out of vault 76, went to the first location that I saw on my radar and got gang banged by 3 level 9 ticks. I was level 2 and didnt have a gun at the time. 
---
I killed a level 22 ghoul who was hanging out with a bunch of level 3 ghouls during my last play session. I was level 6 at the time. 
---
It seems like huge dudes are just randomly hidden with small guys. The only oddity I've really noticed is that the abnormally high level guys never seem to be any tougher than their low level buddies.
---
We need more regular free weeks.
---
Medic's used to be really good before overdrive got nerfed.
---
It is based on your number of direct hits, meaning shotguns get far more healing out of it than other weapons, which only get one proc of it's relatively minor healing effect, which I believe is the same as vampire's 2hp/sec for 5 seconds.
---
You really need to have a build and/or weapon that can land a lot of crits quickly to get a really noticeable effect out of it.
---
Lol Then keep the feature toggled off.
---
Okay that makes more sense. Bethesda changed Charleston to a high level area with the last patch. I'm not sure if it's a bug or not but it should be limited to just that area. The rest of the forest should.be fine.
---
You completely miss the point.  You're not supposed to spend money on atoms because they're overpriced, not because working for them makes you feel better about it.  The prices in the atom shop are ridiculous and the business practices despicable.  You shouldn't be earning your atoms in game because it's more gratifying, you should be doing so because the alternative is spending 3 dollars for a silly hat.
---
It works well for me as I keep four on me as I cycle through depending on what I need it for.  So it's not useless just depends on your needs.
---
No, the helmet has never been available for consoles. And wouldn't be "available" for PC's either if it wasn't for people using exploits/hacks to gain access to dev room inside the game and take it from there.
---
It is often less contested, and has both a safe and a terminal, which are gaurenteed and can set you up really nicely, also there is a nuke briefcase spawn on the roof and good routs to get to other nearby areas. 
---
I personally don't spawn there directly, but I do put myself in a position to go there early if nobody else spawns in the immediate area.
---
Do you know the definition of negligence? This is absurd.
---
5-10 per hit I think
---
Yes, you are correct. I learned this by my third alt.
---
Or just don’t buy the silly hat as it has zero effect on gameplay? Do you get mad when you walk in a store and see an ugly pair of shoes for 5x the price of what you think shoes are worth? Of course not. You just don’t buy them and move on.
---
Poo poo
---
The flatwoods monster should drop new mods for the alien blaster that makes it viable. Making fighting the flatwoods monster super rewarding. It also gives us a lore friendly way of obtaining cool alien blaster mods.
---
Edit: typo
---
That actually sounds pretty cool. Making you be more worried about coming across a big enemy due to surprise factor and constantly having to look over your shoulder. Would definitely make things more interesting
---
Yes
---
Aw hell naw, i'm lvl 235 I am not about to go throught all that trouble again.
---
I dunno man, no blinds does kinda feel like you’re in a fishbowl. But then I am also irrationally bothered by my real-life neighbours having no blinds in their kitchen.
---
Did you report a ticket to Bethesda?
---
I believe the OP was referring the smaller quantity daily challenges that occasionally pop up.
---
For the normal challenges with such high quantity  just equip the needed weapon and clear mobs in the forest.
---
Fuck a duck. All these hours and I never knew that. Thanks mister.
---
Still boggles my brain that they didn’t do this. First thing I thought when I heard about survival mode was ‘awesome. Start from level 1 again and ditch legendary weapons and armor.’ It’s like they were terrified of doing too much to distance it from adventure mode.
---
Not all of it, .308 and .45 sell slow because of how easy they are to find
---
How about giving him a combat AI first. In all of my encounters he just stood there and and let himself be beat yo death. Immersion first!
---
Oh god I read that as feltching first time
---
Yeah, I’m always conflicted on workaround guides. On one hand they’re mostly quite helpful, but on the other hand I worry that it’ll somehow get back to the devs and they’ll take it as a problem solved. See the settlement system for example, which has a good selection of workaround guides by now when what it really needs is a nuts and bolts overhaul.
---
I'd say about 80-90% of the things in the shop are overpriced.  Does buying the silly hat have any effect on gameplay?  Well it has an effect on the game, that's for sure.  The microtransactions are a part of the game.  Things like the scavenger protectron have an actual use and aren't just cosmetic and should be a part of the base game but because the atom shop exists there is an opportunity to get 5 bucks out of every player that wants one and if they don't have it then they're at a disadvantage to the players that do.  And don't even get me started on the repair kits because they knew repairing broken gear sucked balls so they decided to monetize it.  There are avatars that are 50 atoms, the equivalent to 50 cents.  That's a fine price.  But some are 150 atoms, a dollar fifty.  For a virtual picture that no one is going to pay much attention to.  Some of the stuff in the atom shop I'd like to buy but when so much of it is so overpriced I'm not going to spend a dime even when it comes to something that is priced well.
---
Nicely done my dude, very nice!! Keep up the good work. I too am helping with the power armour. At the moment i am helping my lady teammate get the excavator PA and power armour bench plans (mining miracles quest), I mistakenly goofed up on a couple things but made up for it with giving her the extra components she needs. We must continue to make the wasteland our bitch!!!
---
Thank you for the input on that!
---
I wish we could get clarification on why this is the case. Seems like an odd oversight that’s easily fixable.
---
Sounds like a plan my dude!!! I tried to add you on but it said it could not find you. You can add me if you like 
---
Gt: Andrew1416
---
Ooh, join the game and snatch the shovel that's right next to the grave to sell at my vendor for 100 caps?  Not a bad idea.
---
You sound triggered. QQ.
---
The game honestly does not get enough credit. So many people bashed it up before it was even released. I havent played every game in the series, I actually started with 3 which I actually became obsessed with. From there I played NV and then went nuts when 4 came out. I too am getting a bit greedy with the content in the game... Damnit Bethesda "I WAAAANT MORRRRRREEEE" (picture the little mermaid singing, lmao)
---
Add “Shovels For Sale” in glorious neon right above your vendor.  Too bad you can’t sell the body in the vendor.  That would be something.
---
That's the wrong helmet. OP means [this helmet ](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/4/43/Fo4fh-nate-marine-armor.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170901163756)
---
Invest it in making some shielded underlinings, if you're a flux farmer, prime one of your weapons and make a tonne of ammo
---
I never really use flux so whatever I get I stick it in the vending machine for around 60 caps
---
Make ultracite fusion cores, too, they're awesome
---
The common flux I sell for around 80 to 120. The rarer flux I sell for between 100 and 200 each.
---
I don't really farm it these days as I don't use ultracite ammo or craft anything that requires it unless I need to craft serums again. But there usually easy to obtain these days.
---
Lol. A hat does not have an effect on gameplay. You just don’t open the shop. You gain nothing and lose nothing by not buying stuff from the shop. Your play session will be exactly the same. 
---
And repairing gear is super easy... honestly using repair kits is useless. I can’t imagine anyone spending real money to repair gear. That’s absurd. 
---
 junk is everywhere. If you need a collection to find 10 pieces of junk an hour and think that is more than a gimmick you’re crazy lol. It’s essentially cosmetic. It was 500 atoms and he’s a fun guy to have around. Took 2 days to get that many atoms. Worth it lol. I don’t even empty the bin it collects into.
---
*locks and loads Legendary instigated Handmade and takes a deep breathe*
---
Ahhh ya smell that beautiful irradiated air, feels good to be here!!!
---
It's always in demand, stable flux and component for making it. Most common flux, fluoroscent/yellowcake/crimson, goes for about 100 caps per. Violet and cobalt usually go for a bit more, 125-150c per.
---
It's pretty much the only reason I don't play it, takes too long going from game to game.
---
Haha no prob
---
DMV has one building that’s a high level area. The other building is low level.
---
That's the tough part. I only have 2 pieces of 35 damage resist unyielding armor. There are 2 kinds. 35 resist the higher your health or 35 resist the lower your health. Which ones are yours? If they are lower health then unless your running a low health build specifically they aren't helping much.
---
Those are bosses...kill them and the horde stops
---
With an option to become feral.
---
The area he is talking about his a high level area, this isn’t accurate for the situation.
---
All good things come to end sadly, sounds like you had a good run with her. All the best in her retirement and all the best with the newest upcoming member. I thought about building a new character but am having too much fun with my first one, but we shall see
---
Use consumables VERY S...L..O...W..L..Y? My game freezes when I open my pipboy or fav wheel and immediately use something. Been giving  it a few seconds between each item and it's helping.. sometimes. Still freezes sometimes. PA strangler heart sets can freeze EVERYONE standing near the player with it on. Do people still not know this? That's the reward set for raids... Beth needs to fix it ASAP as more and more people are able to make that damned set.
---
The Collections has some issues and will show values incorrectly at times but this is only a visual bug thankfully so they are still usable and should show correctly if you log out and back in. The devs are aware of this.
---
Yeah I've stopped taking it. I took a break from the game. Before, no one bothered that workshop or cared. When I came back I didn't realize the pvp'ers had discovered it 😄
---
LMAO. I do believe Wastelanders is bringing out a shit ton of new stuff included some new mutated enemies. I still remember my first sheepsquatch encounter, did it solo in the ash heap near the fire department. Hairy bastard was sleeping, I usually VATS every few mins to see if anything is around and just happen to NOT do it this time.... I think I felt a couple turtle heads poke out my rear when he popped up from his slumber
---
I'm sorry I've upset you.
---
While I get your point I’m not sure it will matter to many players who can one shot the said enemies, having a kill everything gun kinda makes you over confident
---
So what did they change on your computer?
---
At the very least, if it does not already work that way, VATS should prioritize targets so that if there is anything aggressive in the player's field of view that could be targeted, then it should pick that first over anything non-agressive. It is unlikely to be helpful when VATS locks onto a random squirrel or opossum instead of the bear running towards you to attack.
---
Fucking right dude!!! Oh it is going to be glorious to see raiders again.... I swear besides super mutants, I love taking on raiders just because of the loot alone, at least from experience in Fallout 3 and 4
---
With Wastelanders I feel ya, I am hoping for the same thing myself.
---
A lot can happen in 175 years. Maybe ALL of the possibilities you listed here happened, and more.
---
It is called wikipedia.
---
It literally sounds like a problem on your end.
---
I can definitely say that's not the way it works currently. I can have multiple ghouls coming at me in my direct field of view with one much closer than the rest and still end up with VATS choosing the one farthest away to aim at first. Super irritating.
---
I can't find any info about the drop chances of items on any of the wikis I've been on. If you know for certain where this info is I'd really appreciate a link. :)
---
That's good to know. I only need 4 more stable yellow flux for my decontamination arch. I've only seen flux on 1 vendor and they wanted 2000 caps per yellow and I passed. I'll keep looking!
---
They removed survival mode?
---
Well at least ir will make the game prettier
---
Honestly I would unironically like that.
---
Cricket cricket
---
All the people going raider is what's going to happen :p
---
You could play with a second character because all the enemys would spawn on your lvl and your friend could have big problems with that, and you could one-hit all the enemys on his lvl so just wait or create a second character!
---
I have a relative small collection of games (in total I think I have around 10 or 12), this is the one game that has me hooked. I get on as often as I can. Being a married man with 2 young children doesn't afford me to be on more than a few hours at a time but when I am on.... I loose myself in the Appalachian Wasteland and I love it!!!
---
Yes, they did 😢
---
Yup. Can't find it in my tab since this Tuesday so I guess it's gone forever :(
---
“Draw me like one of your French ghouls”
---
Implying NW is a fair and balance pvp area. LOOOOL
---
I had 2 scorchbeast attack my camp when I logged in the other day. I'm no where near a fissure site, it was strange! And I had a 3* 68 super mutant attack my camp. I know I've been dying a lot more frequently and can't figure out why. I was just chalking it up to being a bad player 😄
---
Thanks for the reply. I think I'll just wait or try to stay within a 5 level range of my friend.
---
I think of it this way: it’s perfectly acceptable to discover &amp; share these little workarounds with as many people possible, if only because it reminds us how nonsensical these workarounds can be. When there’s community awareness, people tend to be more vocal about demanding fixes.
---
This one obviously won’t get any special attention from the devs, nor do I expect a fix any time soon. But I try to think positive.
---
Damn thats where i played :/ i never found too many toxic people.
---
Are you able to launch the game directly from exe. Without using the launcher?
---
Glad we are not neighbors. No blinds there either, lol.
---
I sell all flux except violet for the standard 100 caps and it sells within a couple hours. I could probably get 150 for the cobalt but I don’t really care. I use the violet for 5mm ultracite ammo.
---
Yet Poe's law exists?
---
I would of rather had a hub area and the rest be invite only.
---
&gt; And repairing gear is super easy
---
Depends what gear you're using.  Some shit breaks faster than others, some shit requires more materials to repair than others.  I haven't played heavy guns in a few months so I don't know how much it's changed since Wild Appalachia but repairing was a bitch.  Playing a rifle character now with a handmade feels like a walk in the park comparatively.  It seems like the recent changes have made things better but it still feels like laser rifles break too quickly.  Haven't tried heavy energy guns since the changes but those were almost unusable.  I haven't played enough in the last few months to really know how things have changed but not every weapon is balanced the same.  Some weapons have fine durability, others don't.  It's not so much of a problem of using the materials to repair them, it's how often you need to do it and needing to stop what you're doing to find a weapon bench.  When I used to play heavy guns, I'd constantly have it in the back of my mind that I was going to need to stop my fun and repair my guns and go around to all my workshops to get materials to craft ammo and that really hampered my enjoyment.  By them offering repair kits, it gives the player the option to relieve that worry and actually enjoy themselves albeit at a price.
---
And yes, junk is everywhere.  But it doesn't change the fact that you can buy an auto junk collector for 5 bucks and are at a disadvantage to other players that have it if you don't.  You can argue that the junk he collects is minuscule all you want but it's still a gameplay advantage to have that you can buy.
---
Except that the little laughy face and lmao indicate that it is sarcasm as much as an s/ 
---
Besides, always having to directly call out your sarcasm almost always completly ruins the joke
---
(Assuming OPs story is accurate and doesn’t leave out key info):  Regardless of what they did to fix, OPs point is that Bethesda support was unable to help. Seems like a recurring theme that can’t be denied.  That doesn’t diminish the good support they have provided many of us.
---
I'm level 97 and my girlfriend just started playing and I still have fun helping her through the story. With my help she doesn't have too much problem navigating higher level enemies. When you're online alone you could work on events and farming gear and materials for the two of you and do story missions when they get on. A 10 level difference isn't too big a deal in my opinion.
---
If u on xbox i would like to buy some violet from u?flux sells really good and also the masses and especially high r fluids.
---
If it's just their kitchen you are a lucky duck 
---
Trust me
---
Use a weapon that's the same level as they are or remove your damage increasing cards and you'll do the same damage as them in low level areas
---
It is. Compared to base game XD.
---
Everyone has the same options pretty much.
---
Should have been a solo story then unlock online at the end.
---
Regular mode used to be so nice.  Now all the leet bois who would have gotten their angst out in Survival are just shooting at people trying to start fights.  Just go fight over the workshops.
---
Morgantown can be outstanding. You get glowies all over, including inside VTU, and robots around mama dolce’s and lots of Scorched, especially if you go to the airport and trigger the “collision course” event.
---
Oh and there’s more. Tons of Cobalt flux between the train yard and the field towards Mama Dolce’s.
---
It’s a hidden gem, my team nukes it frequently.
---
Why do they ruin it
---
I do love doing quests &amp; completing events with my friends but I still hope in the future we can get a offline option in case of someday they take down the servers.
---
Private servers were said a couple months ago to come "sooner than you would expect". Hopefully that means before the end of the year. The bad news is that there is a fair chance they will be paid, at least based on how it is implemented in other online games, and that it was already confirmed in 2018 that private servers will be hosted as a service, rather than by the players.
---
Please define what you mean by “any of us”.  
---
I agree that others can ruin player experiences, but it’s flawed to think ones viewpoint stands for the entire community without evidence.  I have been following this sub since release, and there are plenty of peeps that have indicated they love the multiplayer.
---
There's a Vault Tec alarm clock 
---
Not worth much but I think it's the only one in the game. At least the only one I've ever seen.
---
What console are you on? I might have an explode combat shotgun
---
4 hp/ hit. 
---
lasts for 2 seconds iirc?
---
it is stackable (using a 10mm smg as an example, bullet 1 will heal 4/s, landing another hit will heal 8/s on the next tic, it adds up until stacks expire eventually giving you a cap)
---
Craft serums and sell for 150 each, uses 1 flux. Super duper obviously so there's chance of double results.
---
Much better than selling the flux on it's own for 100 or less as others have suggested.
---
Grounded sells pretty well.
---
Thanks, for the insight. I might just do that.
---
Everyone has the same options in adventure also.
---
True
---
Could be nice. New loot/ammo could be spawned through scorchbeast event. Like a SB that attack a BoS/enclave vertibird and make it rain loot for both responders and scorched.
---
Responders can launch a few Responders Bots after certain time and scorched could use support from a SB that use its green mist attack to infect people (convert them to scorched after x minutes or lower max hp by 25% while infected). Makes me think of Red Orchestra, one player is chosen as the general and he can launch smoke/mortar strikes.
---
Since the responder in the airport never had the Free State sound device that weaken SB, it could be a fair fight. Even if, the responders in the airport never survived the attack in adventure mode. Maybe a BoS/FS vs Scorched is more lore friendly since both camps already fought and won/loose fights against scorched and SB.
---
BoS could use an unique player in PA with infinite core as a general to launch vertibird support, and scorched could use an unique player in heavy raider armor able to "request" mist drop/sonic beam. At the end, a boss fight could happen : Legendary SB AI vs BoS survivor or Legendary vertibird AI with explosive rounds vs scorched survivors. Both bosses with different stats than their Adventure mode version (vertibirds are to easy and SB maybe a bit to hard, both legendary because we need them to regen their health before the final fight).
---
This game mode could use the perks loadout planned for 2020 as a "class system". The "general" on each team is randomly choosed.
---
I'd love join a lobby with 15/25 BoS members in an intact Venture camp with different BoS outfits from their class, or 15/25 scorched in a base near a fissure site with responders/military/nurse/raiders outfit from their class O_O
---
Rewards could be generated the same way they are in NW, based on survival time, cooperation/kill efficiency, AI killed (more points because AI are bosses). Unlocks could be BoS/civilian/military pre scorched themed cosmetics/CAMP builds/player icons. Mode XP could be use to upgrade one classe perks loadout. With some matchmaking buckets based on levels (because if there is a maxed "commando" build in their team, you must be able to have a maxed counterpart in your team, unlike NW where we're all mixed.)
---
You have to use the crit yourself by hitting the proper button while in VATS. 
---
Crits don't have anything to do with the hit location.
---
I'd like to see frequent  hoards of monsters like sheep squatch and desthclaw and snallygaster etc  not an event... They could just show up at your camp... Catch you while you're sleeping or idle
---
Just also adding that if this subreddit is a real indication, the removal of survival has contributed to the situation OP describes.
---
I live in Canada so fallout 4 is 40$ I think and 76 is 54$,
---
So basically my V/E mini is op for healing since it shoots so damn fast and the explosive is aoe hitting more?
---
Could I hear some examples?
---
yup, the explosive counts as a second hit for extra proc's.  one of my raid teams has one and that person has basically godmode as long as he can afford to feed the thing.
---
Maybe make a seperate perk card set for just the stash and camp. Because displays and vendors in camp take up stash weight. You could reduce junk weight, reduce vendor weight, reduce chem weight, reduce display weight, increase base stash weight, increase build budget. Then people could choose what they want to focus on.
---
Then say you were using a vendor reduce card but removing it would put you over weight then you couldn't remove it until you brought vendor weight down enough to remove it.
---
Yet, you bought a multiplayer Fallout. That was advertised, as a mutiplayer Fallout. And was sold, as a multiplayer Fallout.
---
Wut
---
Nuclear winter has nothing to do with survival.  A lot of people played survival and were not very interested in pvp but they played it for the tension you get when you are walking around or doing quests and you don't know if someone is watching you. People who never played survival don't know what is like to play in a wasteland because that feeling doesn't exist on adventure.
---
10 000
---
Same.
---
I would like to support this idea, but there is already enough annoyance because of finding locations already cleared by other players. Without scrap weight, there would be nothing to limit hoarders who server hop many times a day to loot all the good locations for resource farming.
---
Honestly scorch queen fights. Or west tec if you don’t like playing with others.
---
I joined a player “faction” on Xbox (wasteland republic) and they do like 9 scorch fights minimum a day. They always do all three silos- I have way to many I just log on to script
---
I wanted a multi player fallout and I love fallout 76
---
You haven’t upset me. I’m just wondering if you actually think this is negligence? Lol
---
I use a vampire gat- with my bullet shield perk I feel like a good as long as I don’t stop shooting haha
---
I had this issue a few months ago when my internet went down.  Spouse didn’t pay bill, lol.  Called and paid, and magically I was in business 15 minutes later.
---
If you have to restart your PC it sounds like a problem with your computer. Just shutting the game down and restarting it should reset everything about the game, if you need to restart your computer to fix a problem, then the problem is most likely with the computer itself.
---
I play on PC myself, 990 hours in, and I never had disconnects causing that kind of problem.
---
You can’t just go up and talk to someone at that level. Who do you think you are? The pope? The queen? 
---
Wow.
---
/s
---
Did you become pregnant just looking at him?
---
Workbenches are everywhere and your camp is portable so it can be anywhere you want it to be. That’s the whole point of the camp system lol. If you don’t use camp appropriately you may find it frustrating... but that’s on you.  Not to mention the improved repair kits thy throw at you anytime you complete the queen lol
---
Lol you are not at a disadvantage to people who have a collection for 500 atoms (not $5. I did not spend money on mine, nor did most people. 500 atoms is super easy to get in game). It caps at 10 pieces of junk lol. Nobody actually thinks they are at a disadvantage for not having it. Nobody is getting it to get an advantage. Do you fee like you are at a disadvantage?
---
People take down the queen so fast she is the most reliable source for a chance of a of 3\* right now it feels like, Arktos works, but has to come into rotation, AWOL when it pops is nice too. These are for chance of 3\* items. Whitesprings and West-Tec still works for general legendary drops.
---
I'm ps4, sorry.
---
It's shit, i just want to be able to explore the vault on my own with being punched 150 times. Then when I'm ready to play, i can walk through a door that adds me to the bottlenose queue.
---
Actually the same thing happened to me few months ago.. It was also in adventure mode.
---
 I claimed a workshop at Sunshine Meadows industrial farm when I was level 20ish back then (i usually don't use workshops to farm resources , just for the daily challenge -&gt; 10 atoms :P ). about 2 to 3 minutes later a 240+ levels invisible dude sneaked into my workshop and one shotted me when I was managing my inventory. I tried to respawn at somewhere eles and still get killed by him multiple times all before I even fully load in, lost hundreds of caps because of this. That is not PVP at all....I mean if his true purpose is to just enjoy a real fight (PVP), he should go fight another 200+ levels instead of bullying low levels.
---
 I believe there's a lots of ppl are still using the same method to farm caps... so be careful while you're claiming/owning a workshop.
---
No prob goodluck!
---
I love that you love the game, I wish the bests things for you and your family.
---
Well done!
---
I am not sure that is a good example... since that sort of player generated lists exists for this game too. A quick search here would have found you threads with pages of info on different items drop chance.
---
That's just a bug, get it all the time. Try buying one again and it should be okay
---
Well, if you think the sample is too small anyway I will not spend my time digging up the links, that kinda seem meaningless.
---
Yes, yes it does. Thanks for clarifying that. Have a good day.
---
Yep. Xbox, over 18 and UK based.
---
Yeah, if you're claiming workshops for dailies, never stick around after you have it. Learned that lesson real quick.
---
Cool- here is our discord link come introduce yourself and read the rules (super simple)

2k?
---
Bloodied isn't the meta for pvp sir. Please catch up to date
---
 I keep pacifist off untill SBQ fights. Someone hits me I reply with my unstoppable monster, insta kill, and move on. Outside of workshops PvP has no real consequences, so how other players ruin the game is beyond me. For every jerk I've ran into, I've ran into at least 10 helpful people who generally enjoy this game 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Trading not selling and 2k? I'm not a idiot.

Tbh I feel like the rule should be removed. The memes are really a nice breather in between the "Bethesda pls" posts.

I wish there was an option to just be in your room without being in a game queue, to look at perks and challenges and stuff. Bioshock 2 had an [apartment](https://bioshock.fandom.com/wiki/Multiplayer_Apartment) you could visit in between games and I've always quite liked it as a design.
---
That's literally the only reason I don't play it. So tedious just for a match.
---
What does drop chance have to do with anything? If something has a 1/5 drop chance it doesn't mean it will drop after 5 kills.
---
Gah! No further details needed. I shall simply count my blessings.
---
There is no answer to this question, because we **don't know** how the engine handles things on the server side. Since there are no private servers and no official Creation Kit out yet we don't know if things are handled differently compared to item storage in Fallout 4.
---
We also don't know what the exact problem is that causes Bethesda to limit the stash space to those numbers. It could be to prevent people to power grind and cause inflation by selling thousands of end game items. It could be that the engine can't handle so much different items on one server. Imagine the worst case when a player puts a stash full of different food. The food spoils and can't be stacked in the worst case. Because of the low weight a lot of food can be put into the stash, which could cause a high server load for nearly nothing...
---
We also don't know if items in the stash are "despawned" and replaced by an entry in a list. If so, they engine would not need to handle other things related to objects stored in the stash like texture, mesh, scripts attached, etc. If items are just stored items with all unneeded attributes attached, this would cause additional workload. Although, "despawning" items would be much more complicated to achieve (needs more processing power), it would not cost so much storage/memory. There is always a trade off between (computational) speed and (memory) storage.
---
**TL;DR: We can't/don't know!**
---
Hahahaha
---
You're running a bit now arn't you?
---
Let's just say that any architects out there should probably reconsider any bathroom window choice larger than say 2 feet tall max
---
I could see the sub Reddit being flooded with nothing but one picture posts if they did though, which would be just as annoying scrolling through.
---
Adult, but pc :(
---
Great idea 👍
---
Great idea, really.
---
No, I don't think I will.
---
Tbh I'm pretty sure it's worth over max caps
---
Thanks for the info man. My build is a full [Combat Medic](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4c1f36f&amp;d=ci2cf2ck0ct1cr0ev2cq0i12lr2lk2l71li2co0l12p00pg2po0ph2pp0pi2sb2s00ei0a04a30&amp;w=ic2pa0p80p90i30ia0i50&amp;m=3bif67&amp;nw=&amp;n=Combat%20Medic) and really relies on VATS crits and auto rifles. I hope they possibly buff it though.
---
don't say it
---
U done it allready?orherwise i can help u sometime tomorrow,no caps needed:)
---
The way I understand it, the T-60 was intended for mass production, so it was done on the cheap compared to the T-51b.
---
Or at least just make sure you have your junk stored.
---
I don't mind PVP.  I really don't. I don't like overly one sided PVP.
---
I mean for months and months, I was a sniper build.  I could hold my own against most people.  Hide in the bushes, get my sneak attack and take back my workshop for some back and forth.  But at the same time I could headshot some people and they'd take 0. ZERO damage.  turns out, legendaries were the cause.
---
So for several months from release on, it was possible to be invincible in PVP if you got the right drops.  Legendaries are great for PVE, but really don't have a place in fun PVP.
---
Its okay dude well both find a new home.
---
It increases the range and damage as well.
---
Thanks.
---
You're weird.
---
But I do have a good pokerface.
---
Thank.
---
I get 3 caps all day selling it in my vendor.
---
Not the first time I've heard that
---
Probably a nocturnal pipe pistol with bash damage.
---
Psn: Lightbound771
---
I’m level 35ish
---
Ark is pretty good when it comes to punishing you
---
Ya, it only buffs the explosive part of the damage. Funny how they could accurately separate that but struggle with so many other parts of the game.
---
Only tip I have, log in and interact with something, my go-to is picking up water. If I tap the button twice quickly and get 2 waters added just as quickly, good server. Other times you get to wait 2 to 15sec for the game to notice you picked up water.  When it is slow server is usually old, therefore not a good choice. Really wish there was any way to see how many people on a server.
---
Log out of launcher and then force close launcher through task manager. Then relaunch and log in. Usually doing that once or twice will work.
---
We we keep nuking the crap out of it so...
---
Banzai!
---
Good point but I need the resources for quests and workshops gives me the correct materials that I need fast.
---
Having other players is cool though. 
---
And nothing beats the 'chaching' sound when you make a vendor sale :)
---
Dolphin and whale?!
---
What?
---
Just kill and kill and loot, you'll get enough stuff lol
---
Yea but I’m not that motivated enough to grind for materials
---
I think there is also a chance for plan spawns in the BOS area upstairs.
---
Focus on scavenging rather than repairing or upgrading gear.  Until Lv. 45 or 50, depending on the weapon, you'll replace it down the line anyway.
---
When you reach Lv. 5, enable Pacifist Mode.
---
Avoid taking Workshops as that puts you in PvP (even with Pacifist).  However, if you want to quickly acquire some key plans for CAMP building, stash your junk, take a Workshop, collect your reward, and then logout.
---
It's not just Japanese. I don't take workshops anymore, they aren't worth it. But I have 4 Japanese friends, I know one kinda knows English, not sure about the others. But all 4 are awesome.
---
Nuclear Winter is a completely different thing than base game pvp. Some people prefer base game pvp like myself. I don't see how people trying to pvp bothers you this much, if someone shoots you, just walk away, not hard.
---
I see what you are saying but diamond city in the commonwealth was founded in 2130 and it's 2287 when we stumble in looking for our son. So if they can do it in the commonwealth, Appalachia should be easier. There's gotta be something more at play.
---
Same I have one as well but he doesn’t understand a word of English so I have to translate what I want to say to him.
---
If you log out after you complete a section it should force it to save. 
---
...I know it’s a pain.
---
You really can't "mind your own business" at a Workshop.  Especially not now.
---
Rarely are they the best source of materials anyway.  It's better to search the wiki for the material to find locations that have it, or ask here.
---
Yeah you can prime and unprime the .50 now without problem, this was fixed after patch 6 if i remember correctly. Also with the new ultracite ammo formula, its worth to use primed weapon all the time.
---
Then get rekt lol
---
Have you tried Strangler yet?
---
Yea I know but I just want my extractors to do the work for me while I watch Netflix.
---
If you want a good time, go into settings, game and turn of pacifist so you don't get murdered.
---
Emotes are good enough for me.
---
Lol thanks, but I tried fighting back at the player but he just one shoted me with his handmade rifle
---
You lose control and just get to watch yourself wander
---
*sighs unzips*
---
One of my alt's camp is in the toxic valley so between hemlock holes, Grafton day event and Charleston train yard I see him pretty regularly.
---
Your progress and items are saved in their servers not your local data. You shouldn’t lose anything from uninstalling but time.

The title of this post makes me feel uncomfortable. Even with the disclaimer. The title will be seen by itself first.

Or maybe change some of the thousands of non working printers around the wasteland to faxes. Then we could message people in Charleston from Morgantown. Or send a fax to an area where a friend is raiding to distract some scorched or a wendigo.
---
Nudes? Or, you know, pay it forward yadda yadda. People help because they want to, not because they’ll get something out of it.
---
Have you found the mole miner vendor?
---
You can find a mole miner vendor at the Berkeley Springs station and if you trade with her you can exchange your scrip for a random piece of legendary gear
---
Yes, ofc?!
---
Word.
---
You use the scrip to buy legendary items from
---
Him
---
Oh, sorry!

Not the Scrips, i was referring to the Modules!

Sry!

Nice see you there!

Use to make vault 94 armor
---
What does that mean?
---
beta is not an acronym but B. E. T. A  is. It stood for "break it early test application " Bethesda even went out of its way to clarify that it was something different during its time just a friendly fyi. But again I'm not here to argue semantics. 
---
Do you love or even simply like this game?  Then maybe help me encourage Bethesda to set up some sort of pts before wastelanders. I can't be the only one who sees how badly this will go for 76 if wastelanders drops a buggy mess.
---
And cellular fax machines, too.... Legendary ones can have 50% better service and 15% cheaper long distance faxing
---
I'm still finding stuff to do in the run up to Wastelanders. Just hit level 101 last night moving my Camp to a more central location. First time I had to deal with a lot of Scorchbeasts spawning so I moved, then I kept getting diseases from dogs and radroaches, then I finally settled in between a power pylon. 
---
I still have locations on the map I haven't found yet, and the dailies I run are always in different areas anyway. There's something about 76 that just draws me back in every other day. Despite some issues I have with the game, I'll always come back. Appalachia is the best world map Bethesda have designed in my opinion. It's so varied from region to region.
---
At the armor workbench?
---
And thank you so much! 
---
+karma
---
Nope. Not on Xbox, anyway.
---
Over the course of the beta and the full release on Xbox. I have made a lot of freinds from the U.S. to the UK. I started with my freinds from school till they lost interest. Then I met my best freind at a lemonade stand ner the overseers camp and my other freind looking for weapons. This group of freinds ended when my freind was hit by a car last year and was paralyzed and has been in the hospital ever sense and the other lost interest after he left. Present day, I met my freinds at whitesprings golf course grinding for there levels. They were amazed by my jet pack and then asked me to help them, we have leveled up and had many adventures and more ro come.
---
Yup! Gotta get the plans first from standard/expert raids
---
Here you go, Mapalachia has you covered. It's scripted dump right from the game files. Not gonna get any more complete.

Oh, okay!

Thanks!
---
No shit totally this.  In the last week I’ve had dbags kiting three SBs into my base among other things.
---
I have a cool place on the right side of the map and offer reasonable to low prices.  
---
I’m resting to get buff and some shit is shooting me in the face and now everyone I see is crouch walking like a dog rubbing their asses on the ground with butt worms.
---
Too bad the Nukes didn’t take all of you with it.
---
So annoying
---
Someone nuked Whitesprings this morning on PS4. Been waiting weeks for that! With Green Thumb I got enough to make 2 stable flux then got disconnected from the server ☹
---
The legendary Module is use to craft PA or scout armor with the steel you get from the vault raids at 94 it’s used so you have to ability to get a legendary armor I hope I explained that well
---
Morgantown airport, top of the world, the rusty pick and the barn where One Violent Night happens all have stages.
---
Send nudes
---
Ant dont forget to drop the mainframe cores after a silo run.bulk all and sell all above 50 besides some scrap u use alot.scrip the heavy 1* gear first.
---
Always.
---
With survival closed pvpers just do that. Had one guy take my fusion core plants and expected dme to fight him I just wished him out. He killed me once because he started a claim while I was defending the workshop from mobs from the defend event.
---
Not very often. They have done it a couple times the last recent one I can remember was when they did the first meat week. There could have been one afterwards I just can't remember for the life of me. They will most likely do one when Wastelanders is release as a big promotion
---
Proper really do that to people
---
I think it’s going to be a positive change, but it’s definitely overhyped. I fear that it’s so overhyped that it can’t possibly live up to the expectations people have for it. Time will tell.
---
This is Phantom Menace levels of hype for this update.  We shall see, but I don’t believe you are wrong.
---
Don’t pass up office fans. Screws are always in short supply
---
Hype is what this entire game has been about from the beginning; reality soon sets in though, so be patient, it will come.
---
Here comes the self righteous ....... I craft and vend I keep around 100 of each component save screws and I’m always max stash.
---
It’s all the weapons and armor in vending that eats it up and yeah yeah put weightless on armor and all that drivel.
---
I'm in the same region and unfortunately in the last week my level 10 was exploded unprovoked by a level 200 (despite having passive mode on too) and just today my friend had his base completely leveled by someone wearing full assassin gear. It is still a rare occurrence but the last time I encountered this sort of stuff was months ago so twice in a week is a significant increase. Fingers crossed your luck holds though
---
Raider power armor is slightly worse than T-45 at the same level according to the table [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_%28Fallout_76%29%23Comparison).
---
A few events have been messed up in the past week. I’ve stopped trying a few until the next patch.
---
Do to really have trouble finding workbenches? They are everywhere.
---
I buy things in atom shop I think are worth it and don’t on things I don’t want. What’s your point? I am sitting on 3000 atoms I’ve got in the game, they aren’t hard to get lol. If someone wants to spend 700 atoms on a fridge, cool. Good for them. Same with 1200 atoms for a PA skin. I wouldn’t, because I don’t see the point but people can do what they want lol.
---
I still dont get why we need human npc, it dosent change a thing if its a terminal or a human giving you a quest
---
I love most of the ideas you pitched. 
---
First: ideally the loot is just like NW in boxes and scatted. With SB dropping more long term things. 
---
Second: I would love to see two new types of SB. The SB Fighter, a more faster flyer than the standard. And the SB Prince. A more stronger and melee type of SB. 
---
Third: I love the Responders bots. Tbh I’d rather see them spawn at random rather than have players control their spawning. 
---
Fourth: the general idea is not good. Imo no one is going to enjoy a high and mighty player above them. Someone will love the idea to BE the general. But overall not for this mode. No everyone is Boots on the Ground back to back. 
---
Fifth: no perks. NW has a mixed assessment of perks and I’d rather avoid the idea of perks. Just let it be you and some rando trying to hold back the Scorched. 
---
Here’s a rough layout:
---
Players spawn in and are given 15-30 secs to place turrets, and barricades and group up or set up their squads. 
---
A SB lands and does it’s screech and infects the starting scorched team.  They are armed with melee and throwing weapons. The Responders are armed with 10mm pistol. (Two weapons that are randomly selected each new battle would be cool). 
---
Crates are spawned in random locations, cargo bots drop more powerful gear and bots roll out. 
---
All scorched and Responders have really low health so that a single or couple of hits kill them. Armour only protects players from that number of hits the armour shows. 
---
After a couple of rounds a SB will land and fight or fly around. Killing them will offer the Responders a very high tier amount of gear. 
---
Once a set amount of round have passed the game ends when the Responders are dead or the scorched can’t kill the last Responders. Although the Responders still die. 
---
PA is still available but defends you from a lot of hits and comes pre loaded with a mini gun. And can’t be dropped. Once the armour piece break off the frame breaks as well.
---
Send kill-a-wendigo-in-a-nuke-zone-with-a-cane-while-wearing-only-a-tophat nudes
---
Those will get you 10 atoms too
---
Might want to go for heavies or shotguns since these two weapon types also require strength. You don't want to invest on both strength and perception as your special points are limited and you will want to invest on other stats.
---
I recommend heavies. Gatling or 50 cal. Efficient and powerful. Shotguns are not that good atm and you have to be fairly up close to your target to do full damage, which totally makes no sense as you can just whack them with yo hammer for better damage
---
Don't wanna spoil anything but MODUS has already gone rogue
---
Sometimes but not all the times.
---
I occasionally encounter would-be enemies marked as friendly. Especially at bot stops, actually. I always assumed it was a glitch. Most of the time they still act with hostility toward everyone else (e.g. the robots at the bot stop). It just makes it a pain to find them and kill them since vats won’t target friendlies.
---
Days ago I was searching for this confirmation. - Thanks!
---
wew
---
Between T-51, ultracite, and X-01, each type has different advantages, there is not supposed to be a single "best" one. T-51 is good for DR and ER, X-01 for ER and RR, and ultracite for DR without having too low ER and RR. In practice, the differences between these resistances do not necessarily matter that much, for example, the 454 DR of T-51 compared to the 398 of X-01 is equivalent to slightly less than 5% reduction in the damage taken.
---
They removed that mod to make room for the npc's they will be adding just be patient everything can't be down now takes time.
---
It will change with wastelanders... just like it changed for wild Appalachia and for nuclear winter...
---
I’ve encountered that one too. He was marked as an enemy, but wasn’t hostile. He fled when I approached him.
---
Yeah I tried that a couple times, and resetting the thing I use to connect my Ethernet desktop to the modem, but it didn’t work. Everything else works fine when 76 goes crazy like this so I’ll probably just take a break from the game when it happens and let it resolve itself.
---
It’s just frustrating when I’m just getting into something or if I’ve just done a silo run but get kicked before I can fight the queen.
---
Player Vending and Meat Week
---
I can tell you if you’re on Xbox the average age is 13.
---
I got to see the glimpse of the mothman at about level 100, and it scared the shit out of me. Also, only seen the flatwoods monster once, saddly.
---
I rock a 2handed melee build,but my build isn’t “fine tuned” like most,&amp; like the above poster stated,leaves my perks kinda spread a bit thin...
---
But I rock a Grognak Axe,&amp; A fixer...&amp; I get by just fine.
---
I literally only use The fixer for taggin &amp; Sorchbeast Wing  clippin,everything else gets smashed over the head.
---
I’m at work now,but I’ll post my actual build later on when I’m home.
---
I have two that I use and I’m not a fully specced heavy. TSE and Zealots explosive.  I run a mostly rifle build because I don’t feel like changing up my perks. 
---
With a + power attack grognak or super sledge backup you should be good.
---
Speak for yourself! I level alts, I don't want to sit at the kids table while everyone else is having fun. You'd be surprised what a low level is capable of.
---
I’ve gotten this where the mobs are god mode like you take them all down to nothing and they keep re-healing.
---
I love the idea. I think it should be implemented. For example, I was on the same server for approximately 6 hours yesterday, and every time I would head up to the prime site there was nukaflora every where, and yet no body launched a nuke with in that 6 hours.
---
 This is  slightly off topic, I would love to see miscellaneous nuke launches from the enclave on random areas of the map, without some one having to run the silos. Even start a random SBQ event as well. That way you are getting constant sources of nukaflora and random events on a regular basis. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best.
---
They said they were taking it down on oct1, I'm guessing it's to stabilize the servers more and to get ready for the public test server. They said they are going to look into feedback later this month
---
You are missing the carnival mutation so I guess you are not yet there.
---
Ive got a bug with the "not stop" events. Most of the time the enemies are friendly and have white health bars and don't attach me at all.
---
You could also consider FO4. It’s a solid game with a lot to do. If you’re a hoarder or someone who likes getting super wealthy in game, that’s easier to do in FO4.
---
its using low-res textures to get all the models in the game, and then updating them to higher-res ones once it knows what to prioritize.
---
Scorched earth and chill?
---
its good tbh, the sound of it etc.
---
My experience with survival once was going on Xbox clubs, saw a guy was selling some legacy's and all so I joined, said he was at white springs. I fast travel to the station, look around and see no one. He plops down off the roof when I enter the station and kills me. I spawn back in, thinking it was a sick joke, instantly killed again. So, I hope they bring it back so those toxic people stay there. But, in the meantime, all those weapons are considered legacy for now(the ones for the challenges every week)
---
Do the same for lower levels when you are high level. That will keep the community brilliant into the future.
---
It will either help you forget or get you out of this!
---
That makes two of us. Should have taken your word for it...
---
I think you're being too negative about Wild Appalachia and Nuclear Winter, but people really do tend to overhype everything, and *never* learn their lesson. 
---
I don't really expect the story to blow my socks off or have more impactful choices than the single-player games. But I do think it will have a substantial amount of content, between the new main quest, human NPCs repopulating existing locations, and the new equipment/monsters they showed at Quakecon.
---
You act like we came out of character creation wearing PVP gear. Everyone was a noob at one time dude. 
---
Plus anyone who was arrogant enough to think gear alone would save you got dropped real quick in survival mode. Just running up waving your weapons around, no strategy and not a care in the world for positioning. Thinking it's just gear is seriously underestimating your opponents.
---
Gear helps, but you can drop a better geared player if you've got good strategy and outsmart them.
---
I'm still yet to actually do the full quest for encripted. I've only joined other players.
---
Player vending is what i used most out of everything on your list.
---
You'll be able to pay for more stash space soon.
---
Wave to your fellow vault dwellers out in the wasteland,.
---
If you are in an area with other people fighting monsters and see a Legendary creature, use the come here emote to let everyone tag it so we all can loot it. 
---
Don't get too attached to your gear or character build early on. Try out different weapons and perk card combos. Once you hit level 50 that is when should specialize in a weapon type or play style.
---
I'd love an answer here LOL.  I'm a level 53, I was doing the daily quest with the EOD robot in the NE part of the map (forgot the name).
---
Some random player just ran up to me and dropped a 2-star legendary right arm, and ran off.  Didn't say anything, no wheel emoji. Nothing.  
---
Dude, at least let me drop you a few purified waters or glowing meat steaks LOL.
---
I remember being fresh out of the vault as a single-level player and all the kindness I was shown. I now go out of my way to always look for low level folks near the vault and drop some goodies and ask if they need help.  Pay it forward and all.
---
Like wearing nothin’ at all!
---
Yikes! Once again, so glad it wasn't me, and feeling bad for the people who it did effect. 😶
---
The only way
---
I kill the prize bot every time I see him. The first time I came across him I thought “oh it won’t be great but maybe some caps or something kinda cool”. Pre war money. Thanks for the junk here’s a bullet to the head. Now every time I get my prize then blow his circuit board all over the wall and take my steel. I laugh every time.
---
I agree with taking a workshop as early as possible, even if only to acquire the purified water pump.
---
I took a break to play two other games and 76 was fun to come back to. If you can, load up some characters with stuff to vendor. That way you can come back for short times to get your caps reserves up.
---
but ultricite spawns there? either way i like this idea.

Maybe you do this maybe not, but check your ammo. I hoard everything in case it worth something. Always around 800 in my stash. The other day I took out all my 40mm, missles  and nukes and just killed everything with them. I still hoard everything and haven’t passed 650 in days. Ammo takes up a ton of space.
---
Aaaaand this is why ROI on serum recipes and selling serums is negative.
---
I think you need to adjust your tin foil hat dude.
---
It should one shot everything
---
Nah, stability has improved since survival mode was removed
---
It also has no bearings on the games' mechanics or his "problem".
---
There is a random encounter where you run into a bunch of dead super mutants and one wounded one. The wounded one will talk to you and not attack, just kinda wander around. If you search the others, they all have sheepsquatch quills. So the only survivor of a sheepsquatch encounter. I usually run into it around the Overseer's Camp
---
No love for biv?
---
I dont feel this way at all.. sounds like you should explore more of the map
---
Maybe a thick mist or something? It’s already too dark at night
---
This should be a thing!
---
I'm seriously impressed at your ability to make yourself feel superior to everyone else! If only that translated to PvP skills in survival mode, you probably would've done alright for yourself.
---
There's quite a bit of potential in the world with music. The stages would be perfect places for them to add community events for karaoke. But then there's great places too ie the top of the top of the world for radio station workshops. Of course we'd need all of the random music to be unlocked to do that properly.
---
Mega lol
---
Rubberband your controller until the server is empty, once you are alone, you win.
---
This is one area where I think they missed the mark. There are a bunch of different monsters in the game, they’re just very limited in where they spawn. 
---
One would think that a region where all humans are dead, petrified, or living as scorched, and where Super Mutants came from one small town would be full of wild creatures—but no. We somehow have a bajillion scorched and Super Mutants and like 8 Yao Guais. 
---
As a whole, the enemy spawns need more variety and more randomness. At this point I can predict where everything is going to be and that’s just not very interesting.
---
Those electrically charged and unstoppable isotope mutations are bad, get rid of those 2 mutations and any defensive mutations. Players without those 2 mutations can mele other players with those 2 mutations to open pvp.
---
Literally Pacifism.
---
I don't know why people complain when that's a real feature that has existed successfully for over a year. 
---
When I'm looking for PvP, I give you a whack and if you have Pacifism on I am on my way because you clearly don't want to mess with it. 
---
I don't understand the brainlets that hate PvP yet refuse to throw Pacifism on out of some sense of a... damaged ego, or something.
---
If you don't like PvP. Put Pacifism on. It is literally that simple.
---
Yupz. I gave away low level legendary that i buy in bulk in players vendors to low level... i'm already happy with my current weapons. Still seeking my armour sets... cant find a decent metal chest armour w/+1 strength n 2 others legendary effects
---
Are you reloading when using the gun?
---
I quit for a while and just started playing again uts enjoyable again to me they added new stuff and npcs are coming next update i believe
---
For me there is no need to really. I play utterly solo but sometimes a situation occurs that someone is in desperate need for help. It’s a no brainer. You just help and go on. It’s satisfying as it is. I understand your feeling though.
---
What I’ve used the most: 
---
Player vending and the Purveyor
---
What I’ve liked the most: 
---
Lying Lowe/Encryptid, Arktos
---
What could’ve been great but fell flat: 
---
The Burrows, Vault 94
---
I'm confused. My understanding was that they got rid if camp damage from other players. A while ago. Did they bring it back?
---
its always been worth playing
---
At least for me, whenever I load up the game or switch servers my character has to reload. Regardless if I had a new clip or not. You get all partial cores when you relaod prematurely. Whenever you back out of a server put all your fusion cores in your stash. Except the one you are using. So you keep reloading the same used one everytime you load back in. Then grab all the cores back out of your stash. There is a lot of bugs for the heavy gunner, since the game was relaease, that they haven't fixed yet.
---
A darker Mire? 
---
My CAMP is in the mire, any darker and it would just be pitch black!
---
Don't forget the Nuka-Shine quests, Pioneer Scouts, and Fasnacht.
---
Player vending is probably the best non-quest related content they've added to the game, I love traveling to other players' camps even if they don't have anything I'm interested in. For quest driven content, I do love the Pioneer Scout challenges and the little side-quests they added with Encryptid are underrated. All of the events they've released have been way more interesting than the base game events, too. Wish there was a repeating event inside the Burrows, though; people were salty that it wasn't as challenging as a proper raid, but it's still one of the cooler locations in the game.
---
Only the vault 94 Style and you get the plans by completing vault raids on expert or standard and it’s only crafted with the vault 94 steel
---
Never thought of hitting robco that is definitely going on the list to try thank you
---
Even with pacifist on?
---
Not gonna fight you but I'll argue with you about new Vegas. NV was more story and severely lacked in exploration, the main component of a Bethesda game. Which doesn't surprise me since it's not made by them.
---
I'd appreciate that if I ever get a good one man. How did you learn how to craft it?
---
Hell yeah a we bare bears sex party
---
Over hyped? Maybe. 
---
Though I'm not sure why you bring up the previous content drops. Those are all small batch content bits. 
---
Wastelanders is supposed to be a sizable piece of DLC. New main quest line. NPCs, more faction involvement. 
---
This is fairly common for online services. They drop smaller batches of new content inbetween releases of their flagship DLCs so to speak. 
---
Also, would you rather have free new cosmetics? And pay for DLC?
---
Go see how much it is to get caught up on Destiny 2. Then let me know.
---
I feel like an idiot right now. I went into a morgantown nuke once and found it boring because there was very little outside. I had no idea the nuke effects enemy’s inside buildings

Enjoy
---
I saw this reddit and give a try, by buying. My friends were warning me about thats waste of money etc. but later on, when i stream the game, building of camp, that market thingie and vendors, that made them quite impressed, 3 of my friends are going to buy this game in few days. Its one of best coop/solo games i ever seen
---
Yeah, I run power user so I've got 1000 rounds a core and it will randomly eject a core. It's screwed me over more than once when in a big fire fight and it ejects a core. I'm not sure if it's a bug with power user or maybe that I carry 2-3 Gatling lasers at any given time. Two ultracite and one standard. Though the The primer receiver ultracite Gatling laser behaves the same way, I know have about 6 partial cores.
---
Definitely will enjoy
---
Join the club
---
I'm under the belief that the whole thing is a simulation anyways, so I don't care if they break the lore, which has been done enough to really matter
---
I am  sure it will fix somethings and break others, it is the way of the Bethesda.
---
Shooting cats is a feature.
---
Only Nuclear Winter has a good chance of being a simulation, otherwise, how could the computer know about the Brotherhood of Steel ? And if it is a vault-tec simulation then why does the simulation keeps showing the Enclave and VaultTec as the baddies ?
---
Also, which exact parts of the lore are so broken that it is impossible to feel the world's atmosphere ?
---
50 limb is still one of 6 second options so it's going to drop. Ranged has 7 so it's even more likely to drop on melee. It is not the only thing that can drop, you just got scrip fodder.
---
Hmmm. Does carnivore stack with cannibal?
---
Damn, I also miss the old times of hunting wanted players hiding in their camp.
---
Nothing brings me joy in this game more than blasting their door an unloading my entire magazine on some poor bastard.
---
You could be bugging it switching between lasers. The only time it randomly ejects cores is when you already have partial cores. When I have partial cores and relaod it will say I have a little over 600 shots. I don't have any ammo perks. It'll drop down to 400 then just relaod. It's because the game is reading more than one core at a time. If you check your inventory it will show several cores in use at one time. But you still relaod when one runs out lol. Itll take a fresh core and a low one, reload them together then relaod mid clip when the low one runs out creating another partially used core. Its obnoxious.
---
No... Did you hear fo4 dj? I'll take the grafton mayor over that nightmare again.
---
I have a TSE combat shotgun, and it Is not as good as my instigating pump action shotgun. They break súper fast and regenerarse enemies health.
---
The daily what’s new comment
---
Level 51, got to the crafting power armor stage of the quest, but cannot craft the armor, or build a power armor station due to not having the plans. I know this post is 5 months old, but seems that people have had this problem often.
---
So as someone who has been struggling to play since Survival went down, I don’t understand why you’re upset OP. 
---
Not all of us who played Survival were/are toxic. We just prefer our Fallout to have more danger in it. 
---
I’ve been on several servers in the past few days where I’ve taken 3-4 workshops on each server that were already owned. I can see that the player who took them is still connected and in close proximity, and they have not contested it one time. 
---
I’m queued for Hunter/Hunted the entire time, I’m taking workshops, what I else should I be doing for PvP? Why is it “toxic” for me to shoot at somebody one time to see if they’ll shoot back?
---
Thanks for the input. I've got another alt that's heavy, so I want to do something dif here. Totally agree that makes more sense, but my altohalism keeps me trying new things. I'm REALLY hoping shotguns get fixed soon, though, so that's a real option again.
---
Now you have to carry 8 screws whenever you engage in pvp
---
uwu whats this.
---
Lol, did you litterally not read?
---
"This is Three Dog" !!
---
Awesome, I'll look forward to seeing your build. I now have 2 toons w/ Fixer plans so hoping to land a decent legendary Fixer soon!
---
Before or after he became Captain Cool Dude?
---
_But are you a legendary 3* Wendigo?_
---
Yup. Rule of thumb is wait for the haze to fade, but if the server is laggy sometimes that's not even enough.
---
Don't make me call the pun police
---
I totally agree. I can't comprehend why everyone thinks human NPCs are so important
---
PS4
---
There is a trade sub. Price check there.
---
I think 76 is best for exploration imo since I have been exploring more than I have than previous iterations.  It might be coz of the Americana/countryside feel and based off of an actual state idk.  Doesnt have the best story, character interactions and leveledng up system, and combat seems a step down from f04 (which I think has the best) imo tho.  I wish it was more host server/peer to peer coop with offline option but ive grown on the mmo aspect, more so coz of vendors, coz if this was just like a offline with connect to friends or small group o randos idk if ill even use vendors outsude of rp coz I can just hand the items to them.   idk honestly if I can definitvely say you should, idk how far youve gone as well.  Ive stoped playing, not coz I dont like it anymore, but coz ive been playing it alot alot, and there are new games that came out that I've been waiting for and there are now more I want coming soon.  Ill def pla again at mext major update.  I skipped the raids even tho I was excited for them, but I could solo them, one of the reasons is coz im a nood meleer.  I also just wanna play casually so I dont mind teaming up for the general missions outside.
---
Can confirm this, it has more stats than a t51b and way more than a XO1. Getting the ultracite shocks is the biggest pain.
---
Draw me like one of your French bats jack.
---
Wish i was. Forest, ash heap, and toxic area take up a massive chunk of the map. Would love some good fights there again.
---
I'd love to but I can't do the raid, I don't have a mic or anything.
---
Find another low level player and fight for our entertainment.
---
Thanks
---
I'm pretty sure the t51 has better dr, but the poison of strangler is op
---
100% it was going to be released as a future quest or atom shop item and got yoinked.
---
Player: "Ooh, I'm getting a fax."
---
Two minutes later:
---
Fax: "You just lost the game."
---
There is a fair chance the update will not be quite bug free, I only hope for a decent (expansion sized) amount of new content.
---
Dang that's all really good stuff I didn't consider!
---
Without NPCs anything you do doesn’t feel like it impacts the story at all. All the quests are pretty much “find out how this group of people died” at the moment. It’s not a bad concept, but you know the outcome in the beginning already.
---
Idk, but i'm pretty sure they do different things
---
As long as it filters messages and racial slurs it sounds like a fun idea.
---
I could've sworn the first sentence wasn't there when I posted this comment. My bad
---
I'm just ready for new content and quests, honestly. That's it lol
---
There are NPCs just not human ones.
---
And I really like the way it works. Its like a murder mystery, you already know someone is dead but the fun of the quest is finding out how it happened. Listening to the tapes and hearing the story develop.
---
That's what I thought at first lol
---
That would be awesome, but it would bring the game to it's knees and explode the servers.
---
I guess, but not everybody is like you. A lot of them try too hard to get you in PvP
---
good question, and nah. people eating and aid item eating are totally separate things. but having both DEFINITELY helps things!
---
I would say it depends on how much you did. I was in a similar situation about 2 weeks ago, but only level 30. I stuck with the character because I hadn’t really done much of the main quest and really never left outside the Flatwoods, Morgantown, Grafton area. I feel it was the right choice (lv 51 now). Easier to get into taking down higher level enemies quicker than refarming for xp with a new character.
---
If people confirmed it its 10 dot dmg per pellet or bullet meaning, it can freeze PCs or consoles with all the particles.
---
I have electrically charged, and have been attacked by other players which sets off the mutation. I also have pacifist on. 
---
So far, I have not been pulled into a PVP event because of it.
---
There’s Rose and that’s it. Where would we go from here? How can the game progress if we kill the SBQ and there’s no more threat on her part? The murder mystery is a cool idea for a quest line or two, but if that’s the only thing the game has to offer people will get bored of it in no time.
---
I do not think it is really comparable type of update to those that have already been released, if the interviews are to be believed, Wastelanders will have been worked on for a year when it launches, and an E3 trailer and November release are usually reserved for major new content. The previous updates seem to have been more about keeping the game alive until then with small content drops.
---
Personally I'm somewhat worried the wastelanders will function just as quest giving static npcs (where as on the off chance they are mobile they will have very restrictive pathfinding.) This is also the first Fallout game since 4 where we have had another silent protagonist and while I am hopeful that there will be options of engaging in conversation, it will not be of much interest to me if the choices in dialogue are robotic, simple questions and then answers (Elder Scrolls Online.)
---
Love that ol drunk
---
Sorry guys, but I guess Bethesda wants to make things difficult for everyone.
---
I enjoy pvp but hate nuclear winter, and survival was taken away so now my only option is to wait for workshops to be taken.
---
I did turn off the mission and still got him talking to me about the body, that or rose telling me she likes and  will gut me AFTER I completed her quest line.
---
Not really. It’s NW striped down. The servers could easily handle that.
---
ive done the most vault 94 and the purveyor by far of all the post launch content.  (i enjoy the vault, purveyor is just a bonus since i get so much to scrip)
---
a close second two options are scouts (backpack utility) and the sheepsquatch/find the truth questlines (they were interesting, i just wish there were more)
---
Wow looks like a good time to whip out my bone hammer if you know what im sayin *wink*
---
I'm kind of afraid of how they're going to do it. Everyone hearing something different from an NPC put me off a bit. 
---
Still hyped as hell because it's the most content put in at once since release
---
I found the best solution to Juicehead is just unsubscribe.
---
The storyline answers those questions.
---
&gt;!The people from the vault come out, they discover the giant bats, they set off the nukes and turn the area into a radioactive wasteland that during Fallout 3 is a no go land.!&lt;
---
I use Spotify while I'm playing...
---
Good take. I've actually gotten two 3* keepers at AWOL
---
Haven't been there in a long time. I'll have to try it.
---
If you’re on Xbox, it would be a pleasure to assist you in taking her out. 
---
If The Whitesprings decide to take her side, it’ll be their problem, not ours.
---
&gt; Personally I'm somewhat worried the wastelanders will function just as quest giving static npcs (where as on the off chance they are mobile they will have very restrictive pathfinding.)
---
To be fair, it is not that different in the single player games either for much of the time. And it is indeed likely that NPCs will not be mobile in the shared world, it was already confirmed that companions cannot follow the player around. But I can still imagine them having an active role in instanced locations that do not have to be shared with random players, for example the quest giver tells you to meet them in dungeon X, and when you arrive, they are already there and the quest can play out similarly to a single player/coop game. At least in theory, we will see how it is actually implemented in the game.
---
Having worked on systems that handle credit card transactions, there are a lot of things that can go wrong that aren't the user's fault. The biggest issue I've seen is address verification.
---
I'm oversimplifying it and it may not have been OP's issue but to prevent certain types of fraud, a credit card processor like Digital River will verify the address entered against a database of known addresses. These databases aren't always up to date or sometimes they even have incorrect information.
---
This will easily cause an error in the transaction and seeing how awful these online transaction systems are, the error may not even make it to the client resulting in OP's experience.
---
One annoying example I've seen and dealt with over and over is addresses in a condo/apartment. The user enters their billing address with apartment number but the system verifies against only the street address. User has to enter a billing address without the apartment number to get past the verification step.
---
It's all interesting from a software engineering point of view, but ultimately credit card transaction systems are surprisingly fragile and it's a miracle it all works as well as it does.
---
Back in the day, the first mod I would install would be “darker nights” and then “aggressive fights” 
---
Darker nights would make it horrifyingly hard to travel before dawn and aggressive fights would make running from opponents that much more challenging, and the creatures could see you coming from further away
---
Pipe weapons are actually decent and use common ammo, don't feel like you *have* to move away from them until you hit 50 or find something better naturally. Break down any you find to learn plans for better parts.
---
I'll message you. Should be on in about an hour.
---
Soot flower, bloodleaf, boiled water, wood, and the Green Thumb perk.  Healing salves saved my butt when I was getting up to level 50.
---
its one of the public events, so unfortunately its now all in rng if you will even see it or not at each public event reset
---
And people can continue ignoring and blocking them. The worst they can do is shoot your Brahmin. If you don't shoot back, it is literally impossible for them to PvP with you.
---

I'd buy that for a $1

I killed the scorchbeast queen today and didn’t get any experience or loot anybody else experiencing this?

Pay it forward, as others have said.

Oh shit I haven’t even played the burrows yet
---
I enjoy the banter at times
---
Dont drink before you play.
---
They have a little questionnaire on their forums regarding the events and rewards.  They want feedback.  Go check it out :3
---
If you're in pacifist mode, they have so little recourse. People are going to behave in manners we don't agree with. This is a given. Control yourself, manage your expectations, and you control the outcome.
---
I really like this dynamic compared to Fallout 4. Which power armor to use is now a choice, and it could actually be advantageous to mix parts, where in 4 it was just a linear upgrade path.
---
Typing failure. I was stating that if they take my plans away I quit lol. They must stay with us. And should be account wise too. But eh just dont make it any worse than it is

Almost impossible. Best way would be to be part of a network like discord or something and wait till someone finds it.
---
Dame that means im 2/3 a wendigo
---
Friend us, keep showing up, and offer to help out on stuff like end-game or high end quests. Nobody can succeed alone. Form groups and help out.
---
I can’t say for West Virginia, but I was definitely more keen to visit Boston after Fallout 4, granted its already got so much history and tourist draw as it is. When I went I saw several people in Fallout shirts.
---
Also, remember that in one of his missions you help him place a signal for her to call riders or whatever you call them, people with their same interests, possibly that will attract the riders of the new dlc.
---
Carnivore prevents you from getting diseases from Cannibal. It does not prevent you from getting rads, nor does it provide increased healing benefit (only Cannibal perks affect that.) Carnivore + Cannibal + Leadbelly means you only truly have to worry about the water vector for disease.
---
I guess I’d like to see a higher level creature ceiling.  Allow enemies higher levels example allow mole miners to 68 and let super mutants go to the 90s.  I hated the nerfing of the areas, it really made the areas I ran useless. I even though I had a 27th level running the top of the world and after the nerf it became useless and I tried running Harpers ferry but that was lame as well as not enough traffic means the creatures don’t often respawn.  Which was why I enjoyed top of the world.  It was silly they put Roses quest so soon in the leveling but it made all of us aware how different the areas were.  It’s as bad as the mistress of mysteries portion running to whitesprings when your below or just into your 20s.  I am glad they didn’t nerf that area.  Anyway maybe do like other games and make the areas level instanced instead of marking the majority of the map useless to anyone over 50 with decent gear and a thought out perk load out.  The first time through yeah the world is tough but after that it gets easier and now I can’t even enjoy it without being way over my head.  I just play my shotgunner when I want to be challenged and frustrated,lol.  End rant.
---
Nice find! Would be great to see that some of the characters from the holotapes survived!
---
Thanks hopefully someone i play with sees it on
---
Oh yeah that'd make perfect sense. It's definitely implied we're not with her yet, one her lines says something along the lines of 'I don't have anything for you right now, so why don't you get out there until I do'.
---
pretty saturated market your jumping into isnt it?
---
Nuclear Winter, arktos pharma, player vendors, encryptid/free range, meat week.
---
I've done burrows a few times but I'm not sure if I can handle it alone so I haven't gone.  It's one of my favorite places though.
---
If I had to pick just one fave, I'd say vendors because it's more than earning us caps and getting us items.  I've met a lot more people and have seen communities build because of this.  You see more cool bases and draw in players to see yours so you can trap and eat them!
---
There's plenty of variety, the issue is that the map is overwhelmed with Super Mutants, Scorched, Robots, and Ghouls, could probably say Mirelurks too. The really interesting enemies are rare, to the point that you have to go looking if you want to encounter some of them.
---
Wasnt really the question but i feel like as long as i dont measure it by views but rather enjoyment, you cant lose much on it
---
Thats the most sultry face I've seen on a scorchbeast
---
You can make your own adhesive by growing tatos, mutfruit and corn at you camp. You need purified water as well. Adhesive is needed for many things and you run out often on low levels. 
---
Scrap every single weapon you find. This will give you materials, but more importantly you learn weapon mods. Weapon mods are very important. 
---
Interact with other players. Be nice to them.
---
Fallout has been responsible for increased tourism to many locations after each game comes out.  Many of the locations in-game have seen an increase in tourism.  Some places near Las Vegas; Sloan, Goodsprings, Primm have actually adapted by adding Fallout paraphernalia around the locations gamers are familiar with.
---
There was a thread here several months ago that discussed the impact on West Virginia and I think someone was talking about some places noticing an increase in visitors.
---
Definitely man, there's some great characters in there and it'd be great fan service. I'd like to see Moreno from the BoS return too as his body isn't found anywhere, he could be one of the Scorchbeast Guano Piles but that's boring haha. Have him return with a BoS splinter group in a similar vein to the Circle of Steel.
---
Nothing more creepy than looting a creepy house and you hear a Wendigo snorting/breathing then they all over you like a squirrel
---
You need all the codes from each silo you can run 1 or 2 nukes for the mats and 1 or 2 for flora. This is a good idea because it would definitely save time. I was hoping they would add glowing ones to more places like every city and major land marks. Lol its really only worth farming white springs for mats and legendary weapons.
---
THE SOUTH WILL RISE
---
IRC, there are 70+ different critters in this game, plus variants of each type.  Also 4 that are passive (don’t attack).
---
Yeah. I mean all games with survival elements like to give you unlimited inventory options.
---
Maybe try some sketch comedy instead? Like Halo's "Red vs Blue". 🤷‍♂️
---
Hmm i would do random stuff gladly if i had someone to do it with, im not very funny just by myself :D
---
So you're just bad at inventory management?
---
You know you're part of the other players right?
---
I was a melee/sniper until I ran across the irate L65 SB.  Sniping weapons were rather ineffective - plus very slow to take down the strategic cargobot
---
Still melee as primary, but now generally use either a gatling or AA LMG for things that fly. (Stabilized3 as my only heavy perk)
---
For lower level events ala Fashnacht, combat rifle, SMG, or 45 Thompson for tagging.
---
My advise is go to you tube search and learn were everything spawns and I recommend only the first and third mission take it from me I almost have all the plans myself.
---
They did -  check out the images below from the Concept Artist:    [https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/018/875/440/large/chris-ortega-player-mutations-chris.jpg?1561056945](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/018/875/440/large/chris-ortega-player-mutations-chris.jpg?1561056945)
---
While this would be nice I feel the game should have other priorities in terms of improvements.
---
I'll fight. New Vegas's story is overrated. There's no tension to the narrative, nothing in the plot happens without the Courier initiating it. The game explains everything to you instead of showing you or leaving things to context, as if they're afraid you won't "get it", so it's bogged down by excessive exposition dumps. And for all the hype about choices and consequences, hardly anything you do actually changes the game other than the ending slideshow.
---
Survival Mode had a ton of hardest monsters in the game. I really wish they didn't take it away :(
---
Dude I was talking to you in that last thread about this guy! Hoping this is a real thing, I'll check when I get home!
---
There's plenty of random things that happen that you could play off of. Insult bot, robber bot, floating camps, recieving nocturnal wood armor, bugs in general, etc. I believe in you! 👍
---
I think part of it is that this feels like the last great hope for this game long-term. I mean, if Wastelanders is a waste of time, if it isn’t the big iterative change to the game that the game needs, if it doesn’t bring with it QOL changes (or brings with it just more problems), I can’t imagine this game surviving that. Much as I enjoy the game, it feels like it’s in critical condition IRT playerbase. If Wastelandsrs falls flat, it just might kill the game outright. In that mindset, expectations are gonna be huge.
---
In a way though this increases stash space. All the available weight you gain will now be filled with more items. I feel it will have a negative affect on server stability.
---
Thanks, ill post it once my first vids go live :D
---
Say thanks if you are mic’ed, otherwise a wave, thumbs up/heart emote.  
---
Then pay it forward.
---
This is why I do leader of the pack all the time. 3 low level legendary items that make perfect gift for those just emerging from the vault. 
---
My first step out of the vault during beta was met with a player dropping PA exoskeleton a 10mm pistol and 100ammo.  Because of this I go out of my way to help and protect lower level players.
---
What I'm saying is: there ***should be*** a reason to visit them. There ***should be*** some actual reward for being in a dangerous area. The nuked flora around a fissure site would be sparse. Just like finding other plants ingame. You would get way more nuked flora from dropping a nuke. 
---
Dragons in Skyrim have a real reward to killing them. What do you get from killing Scorchbeasts? Food? Ultracite? Dragon Souls are way more useful than anything a Scorchbeast can currently drop.
---
Play, try for yourself. Costs you nothing. Try out new stuff. If you're gear-focused, Junkies builds work well for full health builds, Bloodied is a common go-to, Sneaky Tesla Bois are a bit OP. Ultimately, it's an open world game, and you have to decide if it's the right playground/theme park for you to make your own fun in.
---
That's because they improved server stability. Has nothing to do with survival servers.
---
I’m pretty sure the update is planned to be released around late October or early - mid November
---
Thank you for sharing!
---
IS it worth it to wait?Cause i dont remember any of my build or anything i did on my lv 43. also on pc this guys voice keeps moving all arround hes right in front of me but sometimes i hear him far left, far right etc...
---
Scroll through this sub for a while, going back several months, and maybe do vids on most asked questions that need explaining?
---
And funny glitches are usually entertaining.
---
Hundreds? The Penn, flatwoods motel, charlstron fire dept (anything with a gym). Thousands? Lucky hole mine with excavator armour.
---
Some people can have complex thoughts filled with nuance. You are not one of those people.

I'll gladly be your critic. I promise any criticism will be constructive. 😋
---
&gt;combat seems a step down from f04
---
This 100%.  and the main reason I quit playing F76.  Combat in F76 ain't no kinda fun and forces you into a power armor build (and I hate power armor) or else you spend your life grinding mats for armor repair.
---
I'm sorry I'm on PC. Glad to see people volunteering they're service.

I'm seconding that you shouldn't be ashamed about purchasing atoms. Frankly, I always purchase the bundles because it's the best value and it's a way to continually support the game. I appreciate that the game isn't free to play because it causes there to be a ton of micro-transactions and I also appreciate not needing pay monthly and not getting anything out of it immediately. I play games for immediate gratification, I think most of us do. I don't mind waiting for big updates but if I'm paying monthly it's nice to get something monthly too even if it's small.
---
Yesterday was the first Saturday that I didn't see 3 to 6 nukes dropped on the Prime site or Whitesprings.  I was really hoping to craft up some more ammo for my primed weapons.  I guess I have to finally launch a nuke of my own.
---
&gt;I am stumped on regeneration though
---
Simple: If you have the Healing Factor mutation, your character grows massive mutton chops and a Wolverine hairdo. *Snikt!*
---
Out of curiosity, how do you measure that?
---
I've never recieved loot from joining in. I just assumed I didnt contribute enough to the group Haha.
---
Haha I wish I could upvote this more than once!
---
Think of the lives that would be spared if we just had a “Thank you” emote...
---
Haha over in r/falloutlore ? Yeah it's proper intriguing, and Beth does read the forums...
---
&gt;Not gonna fight you but I'll argue with you about new Vegas.
---
Not to mention it has not aged well and (IMO) combat is awful, animations are awful and character design really shows it's age.
---
I never played it when it first came out so I went in withOUT the rose tinted glasses and found it severely lacking on all fronts.
---
This is also my opinion of F03.  I'm sure in their day they were the best, but they crumble by today's standards.
---
Well i dunno about that but the November 14th in West Virginia is now officialy the "Reclaimation Day" in real life.
---
The biggest problem I have with being melee and electrically charged is in a high level mob (think WS golf glubhouse)
---
 You take damage from each critter the charge hits.
---
Subjectively, the higher level the critter, the harder the charge hits you.  
---
.Being grounded seems to offset it a bit, but sill have to keep an eye on your health.
---
Healing Factor for once the fight is over...
---
Has not caused PvP for other layers being close when it activates.
---
There is Fallout 76 merch in the Mothman museum now.  And there were people in costume at the festival.
---
Would appreciate that :D NightinGery#8190 on discord
---
Not to mention, the new darling of the Fallout series, NV, may have been the biggest launch of all FO games. 
---
People seem to gloss over that when complaining about 76 and talking up NV. 
---
A simple Google search of New Vegas Launch reviews is a fun trip down but ridden memory lane.
---
If you’re British any time is tea time!
---
Unless you run a giant teapot then it’s only when you feel like it...
---
No thanks. Splitting communities is a terrible idea.
---
Me too its like they are all the happy to add bugs that hurt you but will patch bugs like campfires and stacking foundations ASAP. Really hope they don't remove the rug glitch as its a core of many Fallout 4 players.
---
Ok. I do enjoy base game pvp.  However legendaries should be removed to make it more than just who can gank the other person the best.
---
And scrap it all
---
Yes, there is no CAMP damage **unless you are actively engaged in combat with the CAMP owner**. Then his turrets can attack you, and you can attack his CAMP objects. Some dude came out of his CAMP a couple days ago cursing me and my teammate over open chat looking for a fight and shooting at us. He didn't realize the two low-levels he was trying to goad into combat were two fresh lvl 60-ish alt accounts that had some of the best weapons and armor in the game. By the time the guy gave up and logged out, we had literally reduced his CAMP to foundations. His fusion generator, decon arch, vending machines, extractors, turrets, workbenches... everything laid to waste. 
---
So first lesson: NEVER attempt to PVP near your house. Second lesson: If you ever DO get into PVP near your house, just log out immediately.
---
I guess Beth saw all the "but atoms are free" posts in the Pay2Win discussions.
---
Thank you for this hard work. That'll help a lot.
---
how about reintroduce slap damage and base destruction? then you'll have something to be a afraid of
---
Yes cause the burrows was huge. Also slated as huge update.
---
Don't get me wrong I love the burrows but everyone will over hype it just so we can get weeks of "Bethesdas new update underwhelming" videos and posts.
---
And you took time out of your life that you'll never get back.  Replying to it. Whose the loser now?! XD lol.
---
Ok. Just remove the legendary buffs from PVP combat then.  Same tension.
---
Sure. Just remove the legendary buffs from pvp.  Bring nuclear winter like PVP to base game.
---
XD lol
---
Isn't that just an error though? Darion Jones is the name of one of the bodies at the Seneca Rocks Visitor Center too.
---
I thought combat knife had the fastest besides handy saws or rippers? Obligatory not a melee build though
---
see the fact you think that players were impervious to attack just shows how clueless you are about the ingame mechanics. People in assassin sentinal armour could be killed with staggering weapons critical strikes and radiation weapons. They seemed to be impervious to you because you are clueless and don't bother learning anything about the game. Like I said dont bother making suggestions. Everthing had counters in this game but its bethesda listening the majority of the player base who are as clueless as you that has thrown everything out of whack and is how survival was ruined
---
I think the governor's declaration was just for 2018, cuz that was the day the game released, but i wouldnt be surprised if fallout fans who live in WV make it a yearly thing. Get them blue and yellow balloons out, folks!
---
Personally I feel that legendary effects should stay to have more diverse pvp gameplay other than no legendary effects and a gun is just a gun.
---
Sounds like a problem with your ISP
---
Ice bear must be friggin buff!
---
I remember seeing a post on this subb showing off the paper signed off by the governor of west virginia.
---
I tried but I cant send a link to articles or pictures there
---
So as it turns out it was Nov14 and not Oct23 that became reclamation day in West Virginia. I will correct that in my first comment.
---
I agree with pickle, I mostly run melee nude. raids are the only things right now that seems to require pa .  The combat seems to be improving but it was def more responsive in f04.  lv100 myself.
---
Club Fuzzy (my camp) has an amazing DJ on Saturday nights.
---
If you want to do both outside of Bloodied, this is what I would try. [Build.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fd34588&amp;d=s42ss2sm2se2pd2pk2c72sn2pl2lu2lt2l71a00an2p00a30i44pp2eu0em1aj2&amp;w=a72s12p60eh2s00pa0p80e10s70i30sb0p90ar0ao0pr0id1ic4ee2a80sa1e81e40l90lb0ag2c40s50pm0p40p10p30e60eb0el0l00lr0i90i10ia0c51c10cl0p70pj0i82ii0ij2i61if2ik0i50iq2ie2ih2ir2at1a51ah0au2lm2l60lf0lj0pg1po1ph1pq1pe2pi1ib4&amp;m=8cefh4293&amp;nw=&amp;n=SmashySnipey) You'll have to manage your inventory better and carry less with you (relying on your stash more,)  but you'll be able to deal passable damage at range and still wreck face up close. Radicool boosts your STR and therefore melee damage, and with Cola Nut, a single nuka grape can make everything wrong with you right again except your hunger meter. Junkies build could work here, or Instigating weapons. For semi-auto sniping, it's hard to go wrong with a Lever Action. For full-auto, Handmade or Fixer rules the roost. I'd recommend "True" and real scopes for the Lever as you aren't a Crit-fisher, and stabilized mods for full-auto. \*\*EDIT: Action Boy isn't super helpful with Lone Wanderer, but if you like it, steal from Ninja and Covert Ops.
---
Not the first time iv seen a comment like yours. Is there something up with console that people cant launch nukes or is it just a preference thing on your end? Im on pc so i cant really help in game but id be more then happy to give you a few pointers to help get you through a silo.
---
Yea you need better internet
---
I know the type of player I’ve been PvPing since Quake 3.
---
They are in every game nothing you can do about it.....maybe find them a dad or make them clean their room dunno.
---
I had sniper, sneak attack, armor piercing, 3.5x damage.  THAT SHOULD DO SOMETHING.  Bethesda agreed. BTW
---
How about instead of insulting me, like a toxic person would, maybe have a discussion.
---
Be real, the current pvp "meta" is duped strangler armor and a duped BE gatling plasma. it is undoubtedly the most overpowered combo in the game and it completely kills all the fun.
---
Yea its really annoying, really loved camp building and spent 6 hours making current one just to see since I didn't finish it all I'm locked out of adding stuff and may need to make my camp over again. Personally wouldn't be as much of an issue if this game didn't remove all the positive camp exploits like stacking fountains and rug glitching water purifiers into bases.
---
Sorry I didn't get a notice that you replied. I am on Xbox. How much do you think you want?
---
Me and my gf went to point pleasant and Berkeley  springs, and we are going back to WV to go to the pumpkin house festival at the end of the month. We are in NC so its like a 4-5 hour drive. Not too bad.
---
True, guess ill just redo a char then
---
It's because it looks the most like something mr. T would wear.
---
Or have alternate PVP effects.
---
Right now they have capped PVP damage at 110.  Making fire rate the most important.  It was a band aid.
---
Just remove legendary effects.
---
How are they ruining your game? 90% of the time is not running into other players.
---
I'm literally stating a fact, that you don't understand game mechanics. If can't handle that don't have a discussion with me. Did I not just state the truth?
---
Removing legendary effects is also a band aid. Just balance out the legendary effects instead of full on removing them.
---
Legit happened to me yesterday. Im only level 50ish
---
Dude steamrolled through two of my workshops (farmin aluminum and acid) and then decided to stalk me to my third just for shiggles. Lost about 500 caps (all of it) in 5 minutes. C'est la wasteland
---
Wild Appalachia was a dope series of updates. So i think you need to look at the sum of the parts. Just saying all these people who think world will be filled with human npc are going to be real dissapointed.
---
It will be the start and a place they can continue to add to.
---
I'm sure it happens, but it's never happened to me.
---
More like shatter your eardrums, give you a headache, and induce a fucking seizure
---
Just another day at the B-b-b-bot stahp. Don't let your friends scratch the paint!
---
You came down to this musty old cellar for me?
---
I can recommend thewidgeonTV he does amazing work on this field
---
That doorway has been there for a while, possibly since the beginning. Not completely sure how long it's been there, but it's definitely months at least.
---
They might have retextured it or something though. Something feels different about it at least.
---
I get this a bit on PC
---
So toxic :P
---
Duping hasn't been active since strangler was a thing, surely? And the inability to trade/drop strangler would also make the duping tricks impossible, wouldn't they? Or am I just hideously out of date?
---
Had one attack my camp before out of no where. Came back to all of my walls busted in. It was dead tho...so something took it out. Or someone
---
Have you met Chloe?
---
I love you man/woman! I worked but just wanted to add some addition info, you need to set it to what it was originally so if you place it down as Foundation - Vault - Tec Modern Linoleum then you need to set it to that. Learned that after I set it all to default it didn't fix it but used foundation with the design to make sure its facing same direction so gave it a shot and it worked I have my space back! Appreciate the help!
---
melee is fairly op..
---
I would put 3pts each into the gun perk your going to use and 1pt each into the melee perk cards for your weapon type
---
[similar to this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7c455bc&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72lr2l11pp1pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1s50si0sj0l71ao0an0ar0p00cu0&amp;w=p80p90c52i30ia0ij2i42iq2at1lm2pa0&amp;m=8c&amp;nw=&amp;n=)
---
A good Samaritan
---
Yeah. I’m a low level (27) - guess I just think it’d give me an opportunity to be able to go through quests with similar leveled people. 
---
Do appreciate the help from you higher levels though :)
---
It’s in the flair.
---
Sell, people need junk 24/7. Also craft into bulk and sell to vendors.
---
Yes sorry, that's what I meant by default, what you orginally placed it as, I should have been more clear. So glad you got it to work! It's really annoying and doesn't happen all the time. Haven't really figured out all the details.
---
Oh wow, I didn't even know, ty
---
Maybe my prices are too high, idk. I’m selling steel for 1 cap per scrap. I may have to discontinue my sale of fusion cores and just drop them. Too heavy
---
bulk it and sell it.. then hoard less..
---
you dont really need to have more than a hundred or so of any junk.. excepting a couple of things that get used often in crafting/repairing
---
most things youre fine to have 50-75 of max.. something like screws or lead a bit more is handy
---
I feel the same way. People put such great hopes for NPCs, I've seen a ton of comments in the vein of it will change everything, there will be meaningful choices and their consequences. I personally don't see how all these could be realized in the game. It doesn't mean that it's impossible to design and implement, but let's remember who is promising. Know what I'm saying? 16 times the detail and all that.
---
Hey me too! Wendigo buddies
---
Hell no. Need for cores out weights junk by a mile. I sell all my junk for 1 or 2 caps mainly and IF I sold cores I'd suggest 1c per %.
---
Oh thank you. Are caps easy to come by?
---
Hint: stock up on leadership bobbles for the XP events. Them, along with well rested, cranberry products, berry mentats and the team XP perk can turn you into a levelling machine.
---
If you're feeling super brave, the very best sources of respawnable XP in the game are the whitesprings sentry bots.
---
This is definitely going to sound irrational, but what if I need it?
---
Thank you for the kind words! I would love to see your version of a DitW guide, always cool to see an alternate perspective!
---
dude, duping is back in force since meat week, not only are people  spreading around BE gatling plasmas and stranglers, the old mine duping glitch is back too and that one is crashing servers nonstop.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxCDXZGTZXo
---
yes, they are
---
This. And you can buy the plans to make your own later in the game.
---
Also I’d ditch Solar Powered for ninja or something else that is beneficial all the time.
---
I promise you it's everywhere so it's easily to farm. I have to actively fight to get rid of those materials
---
That would increase damage, I'm loath to move more into perception, I keep wishing for another 10 points, I'd love 60 :)
---
I'd need 6 points to max commando and I realise I should take them from strength, I'm really compromising by being melee and rifle, need to decide I guess.
---
Cheers!
---
Lol I'd buy all of them at that price
---
Not that I've noticed but it's possible.
---
Weapons without legendary effects is like vegan bacon. And you said yourself it would make pve less fun, can't imagine how it would somehow make PVP more fun. And not a diss to NW but you have a mode where you can play without legendaries and it fits in well in that format. 
---
I agree with the other guy, knowing the game mechanics is key. Even if only had vanilla gear I could kill some one with good gear who is ignorant to the PVP mechanics easily. Done it loads of times leveling alts without good gear.
---
I have this happen with SBs everyday. Wish you could tame one!
---
Plastic super hard to come buy for bulking? That is not true.
---
thats interesting i'd never considered that.
---
  id like to point out tho that getting attacked in a workshop pretty much demands all attention on anothr player's schedule (whichis annoying in and of itself), but also makes any future play at that workshop/server much less likely.  ppl dont just tend to carry on in my experience.
---
there's also a tremendous gulf of difference between having a fair fight and ambushing.  these erstwhile raiders just like bushwhacking people, and then get all suprised pikachu when ppl don't like being bushwhack fodder
---
Ah well at least that answers that. Yeah I thought there was something off with tge area, but haven't been there in months as I only did her questline once with my first character. As much as I like Rose her quests were gutter-level quality.
---
I usually run with Nerd Rage @ 3 in intelligence this explosive issue has only cropped up since this medic's handmade explosive dropped, I'll probably sell it and move on.
---
And I agree, this *demolition expert* just seems a waste and I love my nerd alter ego raging away :D
---
Its pretty random.  You arent guaranteed to get any specific weapon or armor.  So plan for that randomness.
---
I like it too.  The tough thing is it still makes it so nobody wants any other armor type.  By the time you can use PA, you've already passed any value of using raider, and maybe even T45.
---
I'd love to see the T45 and Raider armor being used by more low level chars.  But the level limits make it not happen, and by the time somebody can get a good level set, they want to get the T51 at level 50.  Everything else is just not worth it.
---
It is a little bit like this already, and probably too late to change, but it'd be cool if each suit has its own strong point, and not by a negligible amount--I'd love it if there was a compelling reason to use a Raider set at level 100. So (by example, just picking these off the cuff), Excavator has the most carry capacity, T51 is the best vs Kinetic, X01 is the best vs Energy, Ultracite is the best vs Radiation, and T60 is the best generalist, but not best at any one thing.  Hmm, would have to think about what T-45 and Raider are best at (Raider is maybe melee?).  If there were good reasons to have each set, you'd see them used more.  As it is now, you can still make a "better/medium/best" ranking and T51 wins.
---
You might not be my definition of leet bois then fren.
---
You are entitled to that opinion.
---
I think it's more about Bethesda releasing spaghetti code that they later corrected as it was not functioning as intended.
---
It's also impossible to scale legendaries meant for bullet sponge enemies when human players are so small and squishy by comparison.  All legendaries were put in with PVE in mind.  Aside from assassin's.
---
🤣
---
Same.  Then I try to repair everything I can before they get home.
---
I know that but I'm looking to buy some instead of go to each specific places to get one thing of what I need
---
are people not aware hunter/hunted is a thing?  its like trying to make a [slow clap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhnXWJmKbU4) happen...
---
how about launching a nuke yourself?
---
I haven't played raids. But I'd like to try sometime. I have a lv 100 unarmed character. 3* suppressor perk with a base model bear arm. I'm relatively tanky and do good damage. 
---
Add me: Fat_Boys_Brunch 
---
I'll play with you sometime.
---
10 levels isn't really that much of a difference, and once you are both past 50, it really doesn’t matter at all.
---
The bigger difference is whether or not you have completed certain (specific) missions and he has not.
---
And that only matters if you have a specific goal in mind for your play session related to one of those missions.
---
At that point, you sometimes have to decide if you want to delay whatever your goal for the play session to run with him, or go solo and accomplish your goal.
---
&gt; And my time is valuable
---
Hence why you're on reddit just posting away instead of doing something productive. Yeah, sure.
---
If you watch his video you’ll see how calling someone names also relates to microtransactions!
---
Couldn’t the Pip-Boy light help you see without burning your eyes, or do you already have it on and you just need even more brightness.
---
Because in the beginning, you could still be coaxed into battle.  Have you played since launch?
---
That's not a gankfest though... 
---
The toxic ones are the ones that only PVP for easy kills.
---
Doesn’t it disappear after a certain number?  It’s like how many licks for a tootsie pop, the world may never know!
---
Me and my wife can two man novice so experience isn’t necessary, we are trying to cut time down
---
Sent
---
Unless you're approaching the 1000 scrip limit. Between meat week drops and the dailies now giving scrip I have more scrip / unscripable legendaries than I know what to do with!
---
typo.  Never went in for long.  I logged in enough to see it was just a gank fest of leet bois camping spawn points.  Not my thing.
---
i took a similar one :) https://twitter.com/SheckyLump/status/1171767742451658757?s=20
---
Overhyped or not, it needs to add a quest which feels like a fallout 3 or 4 game. If it doesnt, most end game players will leave sooner or later. And if this works, they need to add quests like that every year to keep it alive. Playing events is simply boring, its more like work and not like having an adventure in the wasteland.
---
I sell mutation serums on Xbox for 235 a piece. Wait until you get scorched genes and then just buy the ones you need, take them, and apply starch genes to lock them in.  Then remember to never take it off.
---
Oh, and stock up on rad away and radx diluted, not regular.
---
That's a good clear difference between PVP and being Toxic.
---
Killing someone to ruin or hurt their experience is toxic.
---
Anything you would recommend before I try to go in?
---
How about this:  not standard rifles, not pistols, not melee.
---
Shotguns.....ehhhhhh
---
I think it’s heavy or auto rifles, period.
---
Pistols DO rock if you’re perked out and get a sweet one.  I ran pistols until I got my rifle cards, and they aren’t horrible, but I get a sweet pistol maybe 1:10 of the time.
---
i edited in some minor variations/tips we use to my original comment now that i got through the whole thing, most of it is personal preference of the party running the raid.
---
the amount of info you put in here is more staggering than those damn glowing one tackles.  this should definitely be a thread thrown on the side bar.
---
exactly.  says a lot about the particular PvPer....
---
Have ~20 stimpacks and that’s about it
---
From my experience, I’ve only done it a few times
---
Honestly, it depends what you're expecting. 
---
A fair amount has been fixed, but new bugs continue to surface (as they would with any game like this, to be fair) and fundamental issues remain with systems like weapon balance. The camp system is in desperate need of an overhaul, but all it's seen is 90% of new camp items being released through the atom store. Player vending is a nice mechanic, but everyone's race to be the friendliest vendor in Appalachia means that, bar the top tier of legendary weapons, nothing is worth much anymore. 
---
The new content is fun, but also thin and a huge grind in places. There are no new quests of substance, with much  revolving around doing the same dailies over and over for a low chance at new items/plans/armor etc. Vault 'raids' were a disappointment, managing to hit the holy triumvirate of tedious gameplay, lacklustre loot, and technical glitches. 
---
A lot is riding on Wastelanders, which sounds like it'll be the first expansion of any substance, so you should probably at least wait until that's released. Scheduled for November, but I'd take that as a penciled in date rather than anything definitive.
---
What’s the going rate for tokens these days
---
You might need that steel depending on your build. If you use a .50 cal or an automatic rifle at all lots of steel is a must. But dont hoard it turn it into bullets. Then with bandoleer perk keep the ammo on you. I lose 2-300 pounds every time i make ammo. Dont use guns? Make 5.56 and sell it for a cap a piece. People will buy thousands of rounds at a time.
---
10 hours of content would be expansion sized, though. Anyway, we will find out in a couple of months. For something in development for a year, it should at least be possible in theory to be a decent amount of content, given that all DLCs and expansions for Fallout 4 were released within 10 months, and Wastelanders could rely on existing (currently mostly empty/underused) locations and assets to a fair extent. And to be honest, if it turned out to be something like 5 fetch quest givers, that could do more harm than good.
---
I can do that. Is it rads heavy in there? That seems to be my biggest problem.
---
Collect cranberries and make some cranberry cobbler (also requires purified water, which isn't hard to stumble upon regularly). I regularly collect cranberries from the Aaronholt Homestead at the top left corner of the map. They're behind the house in the field. Cranberry cobbler gives you 5% bonus XP. Also sleep on a raised bed for an extra ~1.5 hrs of bonus XP. 
---
Also, a lot of people say to kill enemies to level up fast, but I found that completing the main quest gave me the most XP. Of course, killing the enemies along the way helped to, but that's pretty unavoidable lol.
---
Have fun and be friendly to passersby!
---
Oh awesome thank. I didn’t know that. I appreciate the knowledge
---
I don’t want to play stealthy. Do you have any other recommendations?
---
If you are the L34 in blue PA with flags, carrying a bladed ski sword....
---
WS was scary the first few times I ran it....glad to have been able to help you out.
---
Best thanks you can give is when you get into the same position, pay it forward.
---
I share rad sponge
---
Budget Is small for some, big for others and enough for most of us. Every little thing you place needs to be loaded and the game can't take our dreams and make them true. Considering the ammount of mansions and huge buildings and things people do regarding camps, I think we are fine. 
---
Building is just an element, just a part of the game, which Is regulated by multiplayer limitations. If you want twice the budget, there should be less players per server. Whatever the case, that's just how the game works.
---
And my wife shares aqua girl
---
It’s the goddamn wasteland people!  You should be on guard for other players, other enemies, hell other challenges other than wandering around aimlessly or adding the next plushy to your pretty camp collection.
---
Some of us like the unpredictable nature of the game.  Killing, looting, mayhem.   And yes, I don’t mind if I get ganked on occasion.  The random PvP encounters are about the only fun thing left in this game.
---
Perfect.
---
Cannibal doesn’t give diseases. Been using it since beta, never gotten a disease. 
---
Though I wish dark craving was a thing...
---
I personally feel that mr howard feels thats 'part of the game' and that its helps to recreate the overall experience of being in a apocalyptic wasteland. That's the sort of people that you might run into in this world. raiders.
---
Yup! 
---
I forgot those guys!
---
What time you thinking?
---
Toxic players should be reported, and banned indefinitely.  I get the whole balance thing, and the fact we need a place for assholes in game. 
---
But there is no real balance for that with in game. I think it should be as soon as you become wasted, or attack an innocent player, that doesn't engage in a fight. The person griefing should have a huge damage reduction and should not receive any rewards for poor behavior. 
---
There is no reason why there needs to be any  form of harrassment with in game. In addition I think if you are part of a team engaged in such behavior, the whole team will be punished like wise. The higher the warrant  the more you loose, that is including all medical supplies, junk, and caps. 
---
The person can turn his bounty around by preforming  community service with in the game, or by repairing any structures he  has damaged, or pays the person a fine for the damages done to camp. I  would also like to see a squad of high level patrol agents, NPC'S going after these problem players, in order to keep some kind  of law and order with in the wasteland. 
---
If I could just jump into the game my self I would, and all are problems would be solved, the old school way. Lol. 
---
Me too! That was actually the first one I ever saw!
---
Yeah, you don't need that much have any of that. Steele is nice to have for ammo even then I've never used more than five or six hundred at a time. Absolutely no reason to have that much wood, same with the gears and the fiberglass.
---
Plastic is easy to come by as long as you know what you're looking for. If you have the Scrapper perk you can scrap lots of different weapons and they will give up glass and plastic. Also you can hit the Morgantown High School , both the cafeteria and the gym have lots of plastic plates and utensils. Should be able to get 100 - 130 plastic.  Plus a lot of player vendors, including my own, sell bulk plastic around 3 caps a piece. Bulk everything, sort by weight, and sell stuff you don't need.
---
Most of my bulk junk in my vending machines is between 15 and 25 caps each and I do that because I'm usually at the vendor limit and still want to sell it.  
---
Can also stock stuff for the future.  Like acid and cloth take up a good amount of space but craft gunpowder it will take up much less space and you can use the gunpowder for ammo.  
---
Oh, and Emma you don't use just drop it. If you really want you can sell it for one cup each but a lot of times I throw that junk in my fenders for zero caps and let other people take it. I'm not going to use it
---
&gt;Leet dudes don't like nuclear winter because it's a fair fight, that's where I go for my PVP thrills. Ya know, where it's a challenge :D
---
a yes the chalange of going up against someone that has a stealth boy and a tesla because of rng.. atlest in the base game i can farm for tose :D
---
Didn't have flags or a ski sword did have blue pa with a baseball bat came super unprepared for the fuckery that happened lol if that was you thank you man that was the most fun I've had in awhile
---
Yes!
---
Floating, everyone floats here!
---
No, Assassins is a terrible prefix, avoided by experienced players and dupers.
---
Going there today!
---
Nice! Thank you for the tip. I'll have to remember that. Funniest part is the mentats are one the chems that I usually end up selling. I almost never keep them, along with rad-x, med-x, psycho, etc... 
---
I will definately keep it in mind. The team XP perk I have maxed out and use it almost regularly.
---
I was disappointed when I finally went to fight one, kind wish the looked more like demons from metro
---
Awesome! I will see you in the wasteland,  good sir!
---
Haha!!
---
do a full shutdown by holding in the power button till it turns off
---
I mean, I’m already downloading it, not like some important decision, just looking for what I should be expecting
---
Yeah it’s not gonna hurt to at least give an effort to get back into it, I’ll be looking forward to that update
---
Look at his post history, he just spamming this post to multiple different subreddits to get people to view  his video.
---
Terrible prefix.  A mutant’s gun gives you the same 10% damage but also good for PVE.    A scrip tier prefix only desirable to collectors and ignorant players.
---
Probably wont get on tonight but I usually play around midnight on weekdays. I work second shift.
---
That's not the direction they've taken at all. The most loyal fans are the ones who just enjoy the universe. Not getting ganked for LOLs.
---
What country could that be??? 😏😉
---
Yes I’ve done a full hard reset and it did nothing
---
That’s sort of what I was expecting, was hoping for a bit more immersion than I remember it having, but I’ll definitely be giving a chance until the update
---
Internet you get from a satellite?
---
Honestly I've only experienced one guy killing me and that was in a workshop, my biggest issue with pacifism is that if you have it on you cannot defend yourself if you get shot at. I'd rather it protect you from accidentally hurting others but not destroy your defense at all.
---
That being said the guy who killed me was doing it in good fun and honestly I wasn't angry at him but at the game for basically soft locking me out of respawning anywhere.
---
My friends have dubbed me the "bubblegum raider" because my real personality all about pink things and wanting to befriend everyone, help everyone, save everyone.  And I decided to make my character look like a raider and "act" like one with the goal of eating other survivors as my main source of food.
---
My mains base has cages setup for capturing people.  But...hidden in the back is a room filled with bubblegum bears (and now that they've added pink wallpaper, that).  I also wouldn't ever want to negatively impact someone's game so I let them out shortly after locking victims into cages.
---
So they dubbed me the bubblegum raider because it's like a fake persona just trying to survive the wasteland but really wanting to do good.
---
Ohhhh friends!!! 
---
I almost forgot...the wooden blocks and what they spell out! Bethesda's got some sick and twisteds working there...BRAVO! Keep up the good work!
---
I buy and sell between 8-10K caps each 2 hour play session.  Lots of folks pay 100 caps for full cores cause the work to win a power plant and maintain it is not their thing.
---
You don't.  You likely buy other things you are too lazy to produce yourself ..... like legendaries.
---
Nice!
---
If you want to actually discuss the contents of the video, i can certainly participate in said discussion.
---
Again, thank you for your compliments :) I wasn't aware that they had fixed Strangler dropping, so I put in a little addendum that it might be fixed. 
---
Regarding the Power Armor Blocking strategy, this is actually one I was aware of, but we didn't bother using it. For Washout, I don't think it is particularly useful because the area is so small and easy to cover. I think it's definitely worth considering in Meltdown, though. I used mines instead, but they serve the same purpose.
---
I'll let whatever country that is live in their own embarrassment.  Because it's not mine... More polar bears in my country.
---
A lot of things were "rebalanced", stash limit is now 800, camp budget is a little more usable now especially regarding turrets. There is a legendary purveyor now where you trade in scrip for legendary items. There are vault raids now. There are many new quest lines.
---
Oh, and stay out of workshops if you don't want to PvP.
---
Yea but for all those assholes out there there’s always going to be kind people to make up for it. Worse part is I remember one of them stopping by my vending machine beforehand, I offered to lower prices on anything he needed out of it. I always happy to help.
---
Yep, I guess utility perks are a go. Which ones? I won’t spec into weapons.
---
If you use a lot of grenades I can see it having more worth, I just always forget I have them.
---
Hey I found 2 bears chiling out in the middle of nowhere sitting on a couch watching tv...Netflix and chill mode.
---
This is a great idea.  It makes sense, fills a need, and is immersion friendly. 
---
On a side note, is there any place in particular that is good to nuke if your sole intention is farming nuked flora?   (especially violet flux)
---
this wasnt me, but i had to do this before. i was level 16 or so, and went to a camp. suddenly im attacked by a scorch beast so i fix the guys turrets and plug away with my nonlegendary revolver. i was so releived when the high level camp owner showed up lol.
---
Oh I had this once everytime I'd go to a camp I'd hear a goddamn enemy last time before I went back to mine was a Scorchbeast, both me and the owner took it down, afterwards, I helped repairing all his stuff and bought a couple items
---
Oh okay, I remember one of my main gripes initially was the repetitive nature, even for basically a mmo. I like that tho, sounds like there’s some extra spice
---
Me too and I always sell each day at the vendor, pressing alt for me during a fight is just impossibly awkward. I sometimes throw an occasional Molotov at super mutants just for the noises.
---
I’ll try and remember that but will prob learn the hard way
---
I’ve been paying between 70-80 per token
---
Weird I havent seen any toxic players in month figured they all went back to apex and fortnight
---
shit thats sexy
---
Yeah. I NEED to use workshops so I had to evolve and change my build to a PvP build.
---
Man I wish I could stumble across you, or someone like you with cool camps and backstories like this
---
 There was certainly a bit of that sort of thing in survival mode. But there was way more to it than that, you have people who have spent a lot more time in there saying they got a lot more out of it then ganking and spawn camping. I stand by what I said, you've spent so little time in there you just dont know what it was like.
---
Uranium Fever is still good if it pops up as a public event, there can easily be 3 legendary mole miners, assuming the other players do not kill them too quickly. Also, horde events will often spawn a 3* "boss" of the given creature type (searching the 4 different locations can largely be skipped if you already know where a horde of that creature would make sense).
---
What platform are you on?
---
What ever happened to Legendary players?
---
I get overwhelmed by mobs at nuked Whitesprings and can't survive. Last time I nuked it no one showed up. It's easier for me to pick flowers when someone else has decided to nuke and there is 1 or more people killing the mobs.
---
I like to ride it in my undies and watch myself in photomode
---
That....is....awesome
---
First, I was "bullied" all my younger years in school. I know what it is, so don't try to explain it to me. I simply stopped taking shit from people and started standing up for my self after I got out of high school. This isn't a matter of bullying the cheaters, it's a matter of standing up against them and showing them we're tired of their shit. 
---
When I said "bullying is q bullshit term used by parents", what I meant was these days, in this "my child is special and always right world" is that everyone is afraid to stand up and say something for fear of getting berated or belittled. We all live in a time where no one can say anything because there are too many fragile people out there. 
---
Bethesda has shown they won't do anything at this point because they themselves got "bullied" by the cheaters and incorrect media publications when they originally banned players for duping and cheating. We haven't even had a response that the report system actually does anything other than us clicking a couple buttons on screen. 
---
So yes, it's time to take a stand as the players.
---
I did the same with a sheepsquach, was no match myself so i kept repairing his heavy turrets and chipping him with my laser gun
---
Now its three of us
---
I run pacifist mode. That doesn't stop idiots from constantly shooting me eventhough it's obvious that I'm taking zero damage.
---
Attack me... We are going for a stroll all over the map. I'm not going to fast travel. I'm going to use you. I will one shot the beasties and watch as you fend them off yourself or die trying. And guess who gets your loot when you die?
---
Dude I'm on ps4. Same issues I go threw. I could mssg you when my server is nuked or if I find a server with a nuke....MY1SIN. u add me I'll help out!
---
PS4. Still a decent amount of players, I’m assuming?
---
I've heard of people who own a workshop getting domed on the other end of a map, because of PVP from a workshop.  They could have been wrong, but...
---
Goat legs is useful so is born survivor. Also you have chameleon mutation which will require no armor to activate.
---
Gotta admit, not my proudest fap
---
Pay it forward is the best answer.  Don't be a griefer.  Play the game like a normal human being.  Help other players in need.
---
Been playing since beta actually, but I don't know what that has to do with survival mode. Adventure mode never even came close to the tense atmosphere in survival, not by a long shot. And beyond that, people goading noobs into fights early on has nothing to do with legendaries and their effects on PVP.
---
If players actually dropped everything, not just junk?
---
4 or more 3 Star weapons, plus 5 pieces of 3 Star armor...
---
I shudder to think how I'd be labeled
---
Legendary 3 Star Glowing Diseased Albino Wendigo
---
With a crown logo
---
I always repair camps that have been damaged. Give plans and stims to low level players, gibe bobble heads is I see your display case is missing one. Gotta support the community.
---
I'll never understand people that keep junk on their person. Yeah, there's weight reduction perks, but as many times as I've seen this kind of thread it just seems too risky. I have more junk than I'll ever need in my stash. If I need to do bullets I'll do a lead run at Lucky Hole Mine, collect weapons. Shotgun shells are so easy to buy now I almost never even need to make those. I literally sell my plastic now.
---
I just took the chameleon mutation because it has no downsides. Thank you for the recommendations :)
---
I’ve been paying 70-80 per token
---
Delete your ini files, maybe something is screwed up in them. Scan and repair? Make sure your gpu is being used and not some onboard gpu on the motherboard. All I can think of. Good luck
---
My thoughts ... 
---
* Barbarian isn’t super useful. I wouldn’t bother.
---
* I’d drop Egg Head, Bird Bones, Eagle Eyes and Talons - ditch those and you can maybe get rid of class freak
---
* I’d ditch Plague Walker period - it’s great for some stuff, but it can totally mess up some events, raids, etc. You may not want to sneak, but you don’t want to aggro everything all the time w/o being able to turn it off
---
* If you are going to be in a group, think about Herd Mentality at least
---
* Refractor is not super useful. Glow Sight 3 is solid. I spend most of the time on my melee w/ Glow Sight 2 and Green Thumb 
---
* I find lead belly not that great. I do find Sun Kissed gets rid of rads most of the time ... rarely need RadAway .. and Fireproof is a great explosion and Scorchbeast scream nullified
---
* Marathoner is OK
---
* White Knight 1 is somewhat of a waste. You may be too worried about item condition and repair - it isn’t that bad end game. Do what you need to get there, but for me and I suspect many others, White Knight is an end-game swap in card for when you’re repairing only.
---
* Ditto for Lucky Break ... too much focus on gear
---
....
---
Thoughts on the other side. You want AP to sprint and to power attack - so find some points for Action Boy.
---
If you’re going team-centric, consider team medic. Also, Whisky is 6 STR w/ Party Boy ... so I’d do something more like this:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f39b675&amp;d=se2ss2i12i42a42a00l71lt2s40sm0sn0el2er2ce0cu0ck0cm0eh2pe2sg2a72cf2c81&amp;w=&amp;m=c249fe8h36i&amp;nw=s3s1p0i0l4a6&amp;n=Team%20Melee%20(No%20P.A.)
---
Use the other points in STR for either
---
 - More slugger
---
 - Some heavy Guy perks (you will need to shoot things on occasion)
---
It's happened to me on 3 occasions now. Nothing else disconnects so at first I just assumed it was the Ps4 having connection issues.  Switched tvs, turned the network off to the TV, tried just having my ps4 connected, I've tried just about everything except witchcraft, and it's still happening.
---
So, as usual, I will tend to beleive what I see versus neckbeards posting on reddit about lol/connection issues.
---
No hunger no thirst for ten minutes. When my kids are playing they forget about food and drinks.
---
Well, it's hard to pit it in your stash when your stash is mainly full from junk. So I started to make it all into bulk items reducing weight. I ran out of plastic cant fit it all in my stash so it was on me.
---
Go get the plans for the small backpack at Morgantown Airport after you get the basics taken care of.
---
Are you aware of how many people report people for cheating when they aren’t even cheating? You’re just encouraging that behavior. People have been reporting people since day one, way before you thought of it. Besides it’s too late now anyway this game is broken and unbalanced and there may be to way to fix it. If they aren’t going to fix things like the impossible to beat stealthboy/Tesla combo they aren’t interested in figuring out any way to valance things.
---
Everytime they update the game be introduced or reintroduce bugs. I am extremely nervous about the stability of wastelanders. Fallout 76 really needs a win and it completely boggles my mind that they haven't set up player test servers before the launch of this DLC. I know PTS are coming in 2020 but that's too late. If wastelanders flops the game will stagnate yet again and maybe even forever how will they be able to convince their longtime supporters that they really care if the most hyped DLC turns out to be a flop. Bethesda please please please add a pts before the launch of wastelanders you guys cannot afford to mess this up.
---
I'm not saying it's going to be good or bad. 
---
I'm saying it will be sizable compared to the other small batch content. This is how most live services do it(see Destiny) and BGS has said it'll be the biggest DLC to date. An entirely new main quest line alone would make this more robust content wise than any of the previous drops.
---
Shh! The first rule of Wendigo Club!
---
da fuck does cleaver/nades duping have anything to do with pa duping lmao.. are you retaarded mate.?
---
Just... you know, how you tell the story, what?
---
And now I have a mental image that I cannot be unseen...
---
Worst part of being a Wendigo?
---
All the jackasses dressed up like Pennywise chaising me around, trying to earn some Atoms.
---
Worse than those darn kids riding around on the back of a giant hermit crab trying to "solve mysteries" with their mutant hound.
---
the only junk that gets lighter when you bulk it is aluminum and lead as far as i know
---
the other junk you should only bulk if you want to sell it to vendor bots
---
Good idea, I like that very much.
---
"I just got wanted for no reason"
---
What utility perks?
---
I run a dual 2h melee plus gunslinger. 15 agility 15 strength, high luck, some perception, low endurance. It is ultra fun and effective. Totally recommended. You can one-shoot with a good revolver, sneak with a silenced pistol and fight serious fights with a baseball bat, axe or whatever you like.
---
If they increased the difficulty and added the story content I think it would be a sizeable update. I'm not convinced tacking narrative and NPCs onto the existing world will be much good, but I guess if it brings in new players it could be great for the game. 
---
And then Bethesda can continue milking the old playerbase plus the new playerbase with atom shop updates. ;)
---
Yeah you know the purifiers people have at their base I've always grabbed some water out of it and I got wanted for grabbing free water lol
---
I'm not convinced this has been in development for a year. Have they planned it for a year? Sure. But I don't think the Maryland team is very big at this point.
---
Yeah. I think so.
---
"expansion sized" is waaay too nebulous a term. 5-10 hours of content was basically the length of each DLC for Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and plenty of people would call those expansions just the same as something bigger like Shivering Isles.
---
You're not penalized for wanting to craft and vend. 
---
I craft and vend. I make most of my caps selling ammo. And while I agree that there should be things to help offset the weight of your vending machine stuff vs your stash, I think there's better ways than just an out right stash increase. 
---
The stash problem you need to "solve" by buying mules? Is only a problem if you can't manage inventory, or refuse to do so, because you want a game that features light survival mechanics to be something it's not.
---
The game is on a down turn right now. Wastelanders really needs to be something else, so that it brings people back to the game.
---
If it ends up being more of the same, well, I won't have much hope for the game after that.
---
First, they fixed the Tesla issue. So it's obvious you don't know what you're talking about. So I'll just stop here.
---
How many pounds of junk did you donate to someone?
---
Wich paint? I mean did you go to the armor craft bench?
---
If you see a Wendigo run like feck!!!!!!
---
I'm excited but not overly hyped. I would love some quality of life updates along side that. You know.. More stash space, scrappable or sellable ammo.. The usual stuff that gets requested. A few performance tweaks and addressing bugs can't hurt as well.
---
If you’ve got pacifist on I don’t think much can happen to u.  Unless mobs get kited to your camp?
---
I would send this. 8====D—
---
It’s tough being a wendigo sometimes. What they won’t do for atoms. ;-;
---
It has a lot of bugs
---
Add one more for four
---
Camouflage Paint
---
Honestly, try turning up your graphics setting. With them at low settings your making your processor pick up the slack. Turn up your setting a little bit at a time and find the best combination
---
What we’ve learned today:
---
1) you don’t understand what the word optional means. 
---
2) you try and bully people into watching your videos and think that somehow will make you popular. 
---
3) you don’t think people should be allowed to determine how they spend their time.
---
I'm rolling for fixers on my 2 high lv characters and lv1 armor on my 3 mules. Think I have room for another 1k scrip on my characters combined.
---
Ugh. Lucky. Polar Bears are adorable.
---
So the people that have been playing since BETA and enjoy 76 pvp should just fuck right off? That’s a shitty thing to ask for.
---
Doesn't matter. They just killed me while I wasn't even there. I did not engage them, I had pacifist on, and they still kill you. There exists a build (idk what) that you can still cause enough damage even if a player is in Pacifist. They need to do something about the PVP for those of us that want to explore.
---
Buff pacifist so that I cannot be damaged by another player. All pacifist is right now is so that I don't hurt others, not that they can't hurt me.
---
Knowing Bethesda it'll "magically" not come on today.
---
Unless you are building your camp
---
Being near enough to an enemy to loot it would be ideal, missing out on XP for not getting a hit is fair enough but missing legendary items is not fair
---
fooooooooooooodbuild
---
Only  2 things reduce weight when you bulk them, aluminium and lead.  The only reason to bulk the other junk types is so you can sell them. And if you have so much junk you're bulking it, then either use it or dump it. You don't need 800 pounds of junk taking up space. 
---
The only junk I keep more than 50 of is steel, lead, plastic. Otherwise it's just taking up space.
---
They’ve already announced they will be reducing the cool down time by at least 50% but the change won’t be made until early 2020
---
This is more or less what I'm talking about, that and how areas stay "looted" by other players when you have never even been there yourself
---
They've said they'll be roughly doubling the rate of public events in the next patch, and making more improvements in the future.
---
&gt;they could take the game offline unannounced for one hour like (like they used to do fairly regularly) and fix this event problem right now
---
Okay you straight up don't know what you're talking about
---
That’s a pain..... I wonder if it’s mutation related?
---
Possibly. They all had chameleon and marsupial for sure.
---
Noted, thanks
---
Lol they surely have not, been here since BETA, I know much more than you about this game than you do trust me. Al they did to tesla rifles was nerf them in nuclear winter, they did nothing to them in adventure or survival for that matter. Go pick a fight with someone that uses one, you’ll see.
---
ahahaha salty foodbuild
---
I will disagree. Expansion has a particular connotation and it usually involves at least 20-30 hours of gameplay, often much more. MMOs create expansions.
---
DLC is appropriate for smaller updates like Old World Blues and Far Harbour, often for single player games.
---
You can argue semantics as you like, but there has been precedence and I follow that precedence. The day Fallout 76 gets an 'expansion' is the day they charge money for the update and it actually expands on endgame and base game in notable ways for months to come rather than a week.
---
Wonder if they had one which gives damage to nearby people
---
Didn't they get rid of slap damage? The build I think you're talking about let PvPers kill people even with the reduced damage from passive mode on (slap damage), but that was taken out several patches ago. 
---
If you have unstable isotope, then players can definitely PvP with you.
---
nope they are still in game, they are now just a super rare drop from enclave events instead of being in the shops.
---
Battle bot happens pretty constantly for me. Are you going to the area it happens at?
---
If you have pacifist mode on they can only touch you if A) you are at a workshop you own and they try to claim. PvP is active but you being in pacifist mode means you can't damage back. Or B) you are on a team and not all players in team have pacifist mode on. If a teammate attacks someone you all become hostile to the person being attack. Same situation as above, they attack you then but you can't attack back. Always have pacifist mode on for solo and in teams everyone needs it on. Also just avoid workshops they are magnets for griefing now and the material you gain from they aren't worth it.
---
Yeah, that's common. What I have noticed is with my PA and two Gatling lasers I had on me it showed I had 5 fusion cores equiped. I dropped them all and hope that clears it up.
---
But if I have that mute, and pacifist mode on, theoretically I should be doing NO damage to them
---
Wah Wah tezwa wifles And stealth boys😢😢
---
That's also why I'm saying it should be a feature you can toggle in settings just like Pacifist Mode. Then people who want to hunt fox in VATS can have the feature turned off and people like myself who don't want to hunt fox can turn it on. When Meat Week comes around and we need squirrel bits for the cooking event, people with the feature turned on can temporarily turn it back off again.
---
You mad?
---
I think I’m going to the correct area. But maybe I’m not.
---
No. I was meaning more towards the perk set up. Weapons and stealth boys you can find. Perk sets are a much more up hill grind.
---
yeah it was a doorway but definitely looks different.  maybe Mandela effect
---
&gt;AWOL Armaments, Uranium Fever, or One Violent Night
---
2/3 of those are now public events.  you can read about that in patch 13 notes.  this changed was mentioned in at least two ITV articles prior to the change as well.
---
&gt;Thing is, they could take the game offline unannounced for one hour like (like they used to do fairly regularly) and fix this event problem right now.
---
patch 14 is doubling (if not more) the public event spawn rate (currently 45 min between) they have also never regularly took the game down except for announced patches/maint. on tuesdays
---
Are you going to the railroad by Welch?
---
If you weren't there, how do you know it was players and not mobs?
---
I guess. Still, it gets tiring suggesting something to make the game better only for the addition of that feature to end up making something else in the game worse.
---
I agree with your general sentiment, microtransactions affect all players, regardless of whether or not they buy them. Developers make design choices based on monetization, so it creates an incentive toward inconvenience, waiting and tedious grind in many models. GTA is a good example of that. 
---
Where I disagree with you is the sentiment that the microtransactions in Fallout 76 are somehow comparable to those in GTA. It’s a ludicrous comparison. While a few “Convenience” items have been added to the game, they are far from necessities and are purchased by very few players. You and I may not like seeing so many cosmetic items as microtransactions, but to argue that they aren’t optional in this game harms your credibility. 
---
I also object to your overall tone, which is reflected in many of your comments here. To respond to those who disagree with you with insults and profanity is cheap, and creates the appearance that you are not serious in your arguments. Based on that, it appears to me that you are more interested in generating views based on controversy and rage than creating a legitimate discussion. 
---
This is also evidenced by your unwillingness to discuss your points unless people watch your video. I watched a few minutes of it before turning it off. Sorry, I’m not interesting in hearing some random person berate people into his microphone. Neither I, nor anyone else owe you views. 
---
If you want people to watch your videos, make a quality product. If you want people to discuss them here—a forum in which you are not entitled to exposure—then you should be willing to do so with no prerequisites and certainly shouldn’t respond to others with hostility.
---
At least they’ve attempted to help with it. I’ve disliked perks from the beginning, but it’s second nature to assume people are mad about Tesla’s and Stealth Boys, which rng decides. Perks take away from the battle royale, but more of NW being its own sandbox war
---
Nice selfie Scorched Beast 😉
---
Oh avoid wanted players now too. Griefers use them in teams. One person is wanted but team mates are waiting nearby. As soon as you attack the wanted player, the whole team is hostile to you. And they goes for if a teammate of your being wanted. If they are attacked and your in pacifist mode, you also become hostile to the attacker and can't attack back as they hit you.
---
I'm much more excited for the supposed balance update to perk cards, and/or weapons.
---
If you don't want to PvP then don't take workshops.
---
It's literally an invitation to PvP.
---
I’ve been spawning in at hornwright air purifier site #03 thinking it was somewhere in that general area. Figured that would prob be close enough to trigger it
---
Theoretically yeah but if you have unstable isotope, it bypasses the passive mode setting. It’s a bug. You should look into getting rid of that mutation if you want to permanently avoid PvP.

I live in the UK and have seen pics of the REAL Pumpkin House online and it looks spectacular. The use about 2000 pumpkins (maybe more) to decorate it every year. Amazing. Would love to visit in real life someday.
---
Thank you :3
---
That’s perfect! XD
---
I wouldnt say its balanced at all
---
I’ve already established in my original comment that I am.
---
You lot cried because survival mode because you don’t like being killed. ITS A FUCKING FALLOUT GAME. SET IN THE APOCALYPSE
---
Because all 4 were T-baggaing my dead corpse......
---
Fallout games are set after a fucking apocalypse in a dangerous world full of enemies. Of course the online version should allow us to kill each other as much as we want. Like rust
---
Biv, some of the alcohols you can brew are fucking amazing. It just sucks that Party boy doesn't apply to them.
---
I'd really prefer not to have to start over with my camp yet again, but I might have to. I haven't got much going on at my camp and yet it's at max budget.
---
You really think I’m not aware that survival isn’t in the game anymore? You never mentioned  nuclear winter in your post. Settle down and stop acting like such an angry little incel, nobody like people like that. Try not to get so worked up over a video game, someday you’ll have to face actual problems.
---
None^of^them^are^real^creatures
---
Of course now that I’ve posted this, the event actually spawns on my map for the first time in months 😂😂😂
---
Yeah I'm lvl 140 but only did it the one time for the mission. I could use the team and practice to try it again so add me deffinatly if ya need a little help. I have alot of Chameleon armor and key cards...
---
On*
---
I don't think it is. But spawning at Mount Blair Train yard will put you in the event if it happens
---
Probably. Unfortunately I just spent close to 10k caps buying all the serums I wanted, and to wipe ALL my mutes just to get rid of 1 is irksome. Not saying I can't or won't, just that I shouldn't have to.
---
I have been a loyal and loving player since release, but the state of things in the last 5 days is very toxic.
---
is fun
---
is bad
---
I do think it's lame that players can sort of hide behind the workshop PvP flagging. In survival mode if someone was trying to slip in to attack you could at least have turrets to warn you and since they are already hostile you could at least try to get to them first before they pulled a fast one. 
---
In adventure mode workshops, i think the way PvP flagging works is just mixed signals all around. Maybe this is more aggressive then players are used to, but entering an owned workshop should be considered trespassing, meaning everyone is hostile in these zones. It would give players a bit of warning when they see a red dot instead of white, and turrets would give you some warning that hostiles are around.
---
I get that. Still doesn't mean I want to shoot them in VATS if they never had any intention of attacking me.
---
is more fun than bad
---
TheOriginalGreyDeath knoez de wei
---
They certainly have taken the game offline unannounced, multiple times.
---
&gt; This is also evidenced by your unwillingness to discuss your points unless people watch your video.
---
Wrong. Why should I repeat myself when i've already explained my points, just because you are too lazy to actually consume my OP in the format I have provided?
---
Really? when was the last you saw or even heard of one dropping?
---
For me it was several months ago, And I do those shitty enclave event where ever I see them. Heck I even server hop for them.
---
I know players have purchased accounts to offset stash and yet again you lack simple comprehension and understanding.
---
Have fun with your bullet farm all good.....you’re probably in the majority that whine daily in here wanting more camp space to show off Teddy bears and dumb crap which both lead us to the same problem.....:Bethesda built a poor game when it comes to handling objects.
---
Your ignorance is showing. You should just stop now. As for facing actual problems. I was in the military and injured during a fire fight and now I'm medically disabled. You know nothing of the problems I face on a daily basis.
---
Actually, to the contrary. They have taken the game offline unannounced multiple times.
---
PVPers generally are just as courteous as regular players. Assholes are the ones that take advantage of questionable game mechanics. They come in waves so things should calm down after some time.
---
PvPers are not the issue here, griefers are. There are solid precautions to avoid engaging in PvP with griefers.
---
You could definitely get mutations for cheaper than what you spent if you do enough searching.
---
I wish you luck.
---
So it’s like halfway between mount Blair trainyard and the air purifier site. So i would think either one would work.  But it just triggered for me (must have just needed to talk about it lol l). Of course I only received a drill 😔
---
The other day, 2 players attacked my friend and I to initiate PVP, and we decided to agree.  We went back and forth, killing each other at a relatively even rate, so honestly it was pretty fun!
---
That is until one of the jackasses realized that my camp was nearby and started to shoot it with his explosive mini-gun. I assumed that they already knew my camp was there and just weren’t shooting it out of courtesy.  But no, they just didn’t realize it was mine and when they did, they decided to grief it.  I left the server as soon as I saw him doing that, so the damages were minimal, but still: it’s really frustrating when some light-hearted PVP (or at least what I thought it was at first) fun turns into “I’m going to destroy your shit”.
---
i wanna say it was about a month ago someone posted a similar thread about them.  il see if i can find the screencap.
---
edit: cannot find, mostly people just saying they got a drop
---
Wait, you mean there is a method within adventure mode to find people who actually want to pvp????
---
I don't know if this is intended or not, but my Power Armors does the same every now and then. I never remove or even replace the Fusion Cores from them and yet I have a few ones with varying degrees of charge, and sometimes before I wear a PA, I have to wait for the animation to put the Fusion Core on it even though I didn't removed it on the previous time I used it...
---
really though, make sure you scrap gun types you like. easy way to get parts.
---
Then you shouldn’t get so worked up over such a trivial topic.
---
I get this from time to time. On xbox, if it happens you have to clear out your backup memory for the game which always seems to peak out at 2GB.
---
Yeah, but to say “its little scream haunts me”... that’s kind of an overreaction, isn’t it?
---
He was probably glitched into immortality mode by his buddy with an energy weapon.
---
I agree with you. I wanted public events, but I didn't want rotating public events. The events should stay as common as they were before, but give a public notice that they were happening.   
---
I don't know what Bethesda is doing. I keep running out of shit to do. I can max my caps and scrip in just an hour sometimes. Do they not want us to play the game, or what? If you're on a server with not much happening, you just sort of sit there. You can't farm locations anymore, since if someone else was there first, there's nothing to do. Take a couple high levels on a server and we've pretty much eaten through anything there is to do. I really miss the days when you could FT to WS and everything would repop. At least then you had a reason to try. Now, you FT to WS and it's empty, I've server hopped so many times hoping for a WS, Wes Tek, Harper's Ferry, or ANYWHERE to have mobs and there's already people there, or were there within the last 20 minutes, and it's just meat piles. Yeah, you always end up finding something, but it often takes ages. I'd even be happy if they upped the respawn time, but lowered the exp. At least you'd be killing stuff.  
---
I've explored the map from top to bottom, side to side, so many times that even that is boring now. It's sadly however pretty much the only way to find mobs on a decently populated server.   
---
Last night I was so bored I ended up playing NW and just leaving my character near the fireline since I need to survive it for however many minutes, and watched tv and only paid attention once I heard myself die.
---
If you have the DPS to kill mobs in a short button press, it's definitely worth shooting them while you pass by, so they don't get in the way later.
---
If you're a heavy user, do not bring any guns with spin up to Expert raids. You can get away with it on Novice and Standard, but on expert, the spin up literally just takes to long. It puts a much stricter limit on how many times you can stop and fight. You also cannot heal immediately after you stop firing! The game reads you as still firing until your weapon completely spins down! I've died to the spindown on my Gat Plas countless times during Novice and Standard, cause I couldn't jam stimpacks
---
not regularly as quoted, normally for emergencies. (like major duping)
---
also the patch working as intended is far from an emergency, especially when they already covered the a boost to event spawn rate...
---
I noticed this myself. While a friend an I were about to enter one of the buildings it said "level 15+"
---
[6.32 million as of the last update, which was friday.. next update will be monday](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
-eta- we almost certainly passed 8 million by now
---
We got this! 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
exactly what do you need help with? are you trying to maximize damage or trying to focus on only using certain guns? saying i need help with a non melee build opens up several options.
---
Completely correct.  Like the time I was overloaded, wearing my power armor, walking as far as my AP would let me before having to rest, and the player more than 100 levels higher than me with his Godmode gun comes and 1 shots me from behind.  Totally my fault for playing fo76.
---
I was making a funny, but okay.
---
i think fridays update said 6.3M out of the 8m first goal, we have to be well into goal 2 or 3 by now after 48-72 hours since the last update. il edit the counter in in a sec
---
edit: link to counter 
---
Most regular vendors often reach max caps fairly easily so until they transfer or buy something they will not list items for sale.
---
I see someone had a hard day at the workshop today.. lulz
---
Imo you shooting once to see if they shoot back is not the problem OP is talking about.
---
I don’t know why so many people get upset over this. I don’t pvp and have pacifist on so if I do run into a griefer, I find it more amusing than annoying.  And if for some reason they do actually kill you, you just lose some junk. Stash boxes are available everywhere now there’s players vendors so not really a big deal. Just get into the habit of always stashing junk, because it’s not hard to collect more. They aren’t ruining the game, they’re just playing it different to you.
---
Only time I dont like stealth boys and teslas is in adventure pvp. I like at least balanced fights so it sucks when they die and come back Tesla'd up and stealthboyed.
---
I like rifle and heavy gun the best cuz u can really use both at the same time that's wat my build is right now cuz all the rifle perks r in perception and the heavy gun is in strength
---
Thank God, and that was fast. Thank you, for some reason I didn't catch that on Friday
---
Automatics are pretty likely so i spec groundpounder and commando.  I like lockpick cuz there is usually some marine armor behind a lock.  Lots of ppl spec froglegs for evading.  Its all personal really.
---
Thank you man, I tried looking for it a few days ago and didn't see anything.
---
Thank you man, love this community. We did it in less time than they even gave us lol
---
How do you get new members then?
---
For violet, nuking the queen is best I think - a large amount of ferns around the base of most trees in the cranberry bog.  Harper's Ferry is also good if you'd rather not go to cranberry bog and has the bonus of a good number of ghouls for the other mats
---
Spawning at the trainyard is the way to go. Just server hopped and spawned in at the trainyard and it triggered for me again. Thanks so much!
---
I had the scorchbeast one bookmarked, but I deleted it because that event was over. I just rebookmarked this just in case
---
Entitled much? Some of us like PVP. Use Pacifist Mode, that's what it's there for
---
Great input!
---
This is true.  I keep looking for stuff to buy so that I can open my vending machine and not just have the caps disappear with the merchandise.
---
Hell yeah we do!! I'm wondering if they are gonna change the reward to the old legendary random sale, or just another 25 again
---
i think you may be thinking of the reward/work put in and loot changes for 2020.
---
i haven't seen anything lately but last i saw the cooldown change is still on for patch 14 (next patch)
---
edit: here is the ITV from 2 weeks ago, this is the latest i saw for patch14 having the CD time change.
---

---
nuke mines are ussles in pvp. with dense mod and fire proff you can nulafie explosives.
---
Low level players under 20? get cheaper fast travel. Great way to unlock locations, is to visit player vendors and a location  nearby.
---
Save main quest for higher levels. So rewards are tied to current level.
---
Now I wonder if we are gonna get the 25-50 off sale, or get the random 3 star roll this time. Im hoping they might get generous and give us something really good since the random roll broke.
---
Lock Marie in a room with Rose. Keep the room bare apart from a fridge full of English food &amp; loads of Chems..............televise
---
The city of Grafton is overrun with newly discovered remains and we need your help.
---
Some came back.  I haven't seen as many as I thought I would in the last week but they're there, crouching with the chameleon mutation.
---
No problem
---
Well there welcome to try only thing I hate is stealth boys and tesla rifles while hoping around
---
If ur entering the devide or mire or cramberry bog all thoes areas are high level areas
---
i think were gonna end up with the sale between the two.  there would probably be a bit of anger if we hit the 50% sale mark and they did the box instead. 
---
maybe they will be nice and give us the random box for next/another weekend since it did get messed up. (ideally for us the same time as the sale lol)
---
I don't think they should remove it, that's gonna annoy people who like to play that side of things. A good move would be a revamped survival mode re release. There's plenty of feedback about what PvP players want. Until then, I'd keep pacifist on and avoid workshop boundaries. PvP people shouldnd have to feel like they haven't got anywhere to go in the game they like
---
If they did to building and cooking and hangin out what they did to PvP id be pissed
---
The scout masks got removed from nearly every list they were on, would have to triple check but pretty sure they aren’t dropping in world.
---
What can you get with them?
---
Here you go: https://imgur.com/a/GqdFN8L
---
Definitely looks different now, prior it doesn't look like the body was lootable or anything. I have this all recorded fortunately (from April 2019)
---
But if you eat a person that has a mutation you can get it
---
Account wide would help for hunting plans and remove artificial scarcity from redundant things being used on the same account.
---
I have a 40% swing speed switchblade which is satisfying like nothing else in the game. What is your load out
---
What's the point, everyone is a jack of all trades. Why do I need to buy anything if I can just make it myself?  It's the main reason I hate how this game did character builds.
---
Only if they would drop as loot. That would be a nice take
---
Whit that mutch information... go and ask Google,  bing or any other search engine.
---
I’ve been having major issues (performance wise) since the last few updates, at times getting 5 FPS on a 2080 Ti so you are not alone!  
---
(Before the peanut gallery weighs in, I’m not an idiot and have done all the basics, and done all the advanced things as wel, including registry edits). 
---
**Question for the OP**  
---
Do you have a second GPU in your system in addition to the RX 5700?   
---
Double check in Device Manager under Display Adapters.
---
Yes! This! Wish I could upvote twice!
---
Wait then why attack us on sight maybe we can talk things out so that vault dwellers and wendigos can get along
---
They need to bring back PVP from launch, cause at least then you could lock and defend things. And if all else failed they became wanted.
---
Its a bug, major darion jones is the guy at seneca rocks, as a part of the signal strength quest.
---
I'm hoping it will be an additional 25 on top of the 25 they have going on now. Save up those scrip!👍🏻
---
Lmao dude that’s the best comment ever
---
Now that's what I call, comedy.
---
Oh you get a hundred up votes and i get -100 for the same thing
---
Uh no not true at all
---
I guess its now alot like other outfits that are suppose to have helmets with them. They bring outfits from other fallout games but dont bring the helmets with them. I would wear the marine armor more if the helmet came with it. It doesnt make alot of sense to not complete an outfit
---
Because your goal is to acquire new viewers for your content. To do that you need to have an appealing personality. Projecting yourself as an entitled jerk isn’t the best way to accomplish that. 
---
Also, as I said, I watched your terrible video. I suffered through your unlistenable intro music, I listened to your initial points and then chose to end my suffering once you started yelling at people. I’m not too lazy to watch your video, your video was too bad to hold my attention.
---
it is to stop afk farming.
---
Food builds have such fragile egos. You’re treating this game as if it mattered.
---
I’m almost positive I remember the body being referred to as Madigan at some point, either that being the name of the corpse or getting an objective saying to ‘loot Madigan’ or somesuch. I’d be super pleased if it was retconned and he turned out to be alive somehow, somewhere.
---
This games code is already spaghetti your just wanting to set the world on fire
---
That was fixed a couple patches ago. You only enter PVP mode if you're at the workshop when someone contests it. If you're away you just get a notification and have ~1 minute to go fight if you want to keep it, otherwise the other person just takes over control.
---
I do wish there was a way to view/purchase legendaries other players have sold back to the scrip exchange machines. I'm sure folks cash in some nice stuff I'd be happy to play with. 😃
---
.. they are caped at 110 damage. and they do half damage balistic wich can be  nulafied .... the rad resist gets absorbed by pa.. do you play the game?
---
I do miss the suitcases outside of train stations being unofficial "Need one, take one, have one, leave one" containers before player vendors and the purveyor. And the vendor bot inside the crafting store inside WS always had the best stuff that other players had sold, and when they took all his caps just dropped stuff in paper bags inside the store.
---
This one thinks you don’t know how to raider. 
---
But May your roads lead you to warm sands.
---
If you get yourself a combat shotgun, preferably exploding and the Enforcer perk you can shoot the ghoul's legs to either drastically slow them down, or cripple them enough to put them on the floor. Then deal with them at your leisure.
---
I regularly run the Whitesprings on my own that way, once you learn the spawn points it surprisingly easy.
---
If you don't care about microtransactions then you shouldn't care if their regulated?
---
That's out right obnoxious. 
---
Let's look at some examples of things I don't care about, but do care about how they are regulated. 
---
I don't care about liquor, but care quite a bit how my government regulates it. 
---
I don't care that Cannabis is legal now.....but care immensely about how it's regulated. 
---
In fact I don't care much about politics at all, as it's rarely about policy,  and mostly about what scandal who is part of, on top of a heaping pile of rhetoric..... I do however,  care immensely about a whole plethora of government regulations and how they are handled. 
---
Second. You clearly think highly of yourself and your opinion. You then go on to use clunky phrases like "objectively not optional" and "rebuttal argument" (more than once)
---
If you're going to try to wax intellectual, do a better job of it. "The most common rebuttal I got" ughhhh.
---
I have a few “costume” items like longshoremen and the  hunters long coat And all my armor is 1* - 3* BOS, Marine, Scout and others mostly all upgraded which fils 2 machines. 
---
Problem is people have no idea what I have and might think I have 50+ asylum dresses...lol
---
I hope they have been moving little bits of things from each patch to the Wastelanders update, so it really is big. But I'm wary about it. I'm willing to bet 100 caps that right after the update there will be a huge upvoted thread named 'We wanted NPC's but not like this!' 
---
Honestly I hope they also have some robots companies for the ready given I'm not really interested in some human like NPC at my camp. 
---
I'm looking forward to new weapons, but in the back of my mind I'm afraid they will just be more powerful and the older weapons will become slowly useless.
---
I'm mostly hoping for new legendary effects, new mutations and some new throwing weapons with some perks.
---
That's why I like the vending of Legendaries.  ALL of the equipment I have, I have bought off of others.  The RNG Gods don't smile on me.  Neither in killing legendaries, nor at the Purveyor.  I get decent stuff that can be sold for modest amounts, then I go and buy gear from players who clearly get an abundance of Good Fortune in having those few actually GOOD items drop to them more than once.
---
You used to be able to find some of those things at train stations and at the Whitesprings Commissary.   Now, both of those vending locations are dead as just about everyone scips their extra legendaries, regardless of value it might have to another player.
---
Sure, you say that now.  Last time I did that I ended up with a restraining order.
---
Can be both of them, i need suggestions like i use this, this is very good etc.
---
Well it stops way more than that. It stops the flow. We have a timer in Adventure that is fine, have the same kind of timer in NW.
---
Already did. Asking what you use which one you prefer etc.
---
Your other comments got downvoted out of view so I'm just going to reply directly.
---
I have extensively tested every single one of these claims people are making about how they are getting killed. My testing all brings me back to the same conclusion, people are leaving details out or flat out lying.
---
After reading your claims here, I logged two accounts on, one a high lvl pvp build, the other a low lever grinder.
---
Low level grinder pacifist on:  
---
Quad Explosive Harpoon shoots for 0 damage. I fired 16 shots, just to be sure.
---
Low level grinder pacifist off:  
---
Quad Explosive Harpoon shoots for 0 damage. Again, 16 shots, just to be sure.
---
Low lever grinder pacifist off, returned fire in my general direction, not a direct hit:  
---
My initial 4 shots with the harpoon hit for 0 damage as expected. The low level returned fire, not directly at me just in my general direction. Neither client showed any visible indication of a hit, however we became flagged for PvP. This one was interesting as we were not able to reproduce it on subsequent attempts.
---
Grouped up camp destroying:  
---
I've tried this more times than I can count. It does not work unless you are hostile.
---
The 1 shot claim:  
---
Others have posted about this. I have been on the receiving end of this and also been accused of cheating by others. I can fire 5 shots from a combat rifle and your client will only play audio for one shot and one hit. I hit you 5 times, you only see 1. I am not 1 shotting you.
---
So as usual, I try to approach this with facts. I don't like griefers at all, but I am pro PvP. Whenever these claims are made, my first reaction is I want to see how it happened. So far I haven't been able to reproduce anything at all when my opponent has pacifist mode enabled.
---
Edited for formatting
---
A lot of people build at the gas station
---
That seems to be a good portion of society today. Watch and listen to me on youtube while I demean people from the safety of my room (moms basement). Please give me likes, karma and whatever else is out there. Damn you if you disagree or attempt to counter my point of view.
---
Unfortunately, the more negative something or someone is the quicker it spreads.
---
Karma whoring at its best, but make sure you subscribe!
---
This one seems to be getting by just fine!
---
I think the biggest reason why there's no fear come late game is because you can one shot super muties with a pipe gun.  Oh, and there's no real penalty for dying.  In fact, it's beneficial.  Want some extra damage? Revenant.
---
The core issue is losing caps in pvp.. literally the dumbest thing I'v ever seen in a pvevp game.
---
Man I need people like you guys to come to my camp. I have mine in whitesprings so I get attacked by ghouls and scorchbeasts. But no one tries to help they just run away and leaves the door open.
---
every once in a while there will already be an item in the scrip machine when I go to turn stuff in
---
Yes im a level 329 bloodied commando and I actively melt power armor with a blooded faster fire handmade pa is useless in PvP and the dense armor mod has been bugged on everything other than trapper since march
---
but isn't it a atom shop item?
---
Thats not fair, I think you are too quick to judge...you don't even know how I look like!
---
Good this one is getting tired of killing raiders... oh so very tired
---
Not. You lack basic comprehension. 
---
You see, a stash limit isn't a fucking design flaw. It's a system within the game. A system common in most games with survival elements. It's designed to force players to make decisions. 
---
Christ. I lack comprehension? Maybe go buy the new CoD. And when you can't kill opposing players, you can whine about it being a flaw, and the solution is to buy a second copy and go around killing your alt in a private match......
---
Because you're not complaining about a flaw. Your side stepping a designed feature. 
---
Fucking talk to me about comprehension.
---
They can go hostile by picking into your camp. Also, never claimed 1 shot
---
which launch?
---
for adventure pvp il disagree, hit workshops if you wanna pvp there.  dont force others into a playstyle they dont wanna do. (do not bring back slap)
---
for survival pvp, id do the launch pvp with the aid drops from later (so people dont losethe entire aid section, but the victor still gets goodies)
---
More like shatter your eardrums and give ya a boner 🥵🥵🥵
---
Only if they also add a ride that you can get in the game.
---
Not a waste of time.  Do ing 10-20 a day and racking up xp, repair kits, and flux.
---
Respec is possible after lvl 50.
---
Either pick a perk card or move a perk point
---
Honestly i get the complaints about peoplr running into your bullets intentionally, but i can't agree with your point about workshop. That was an intentional game choice and just because they didnt take the workshop, doesnt mean they're toxic. Youre painting a big target on your back and people who want pvp arent inherently wrong or toxic. I think youre salted about this and being a little to sensitive.
---
So you dont gain extra SPECIAL after 50?
---
by chance have you tested the wanted player vs passive with isotope/charged? i keep seeing mixed answers of its patched / its back.
---
Okay, there's 1 reason 😂
---
I still drop ammo, junk, plans and aid in blue cases.  Seldom legendaries unless I am super weight capped.
---
You need to do more.   Done hundreds and rarely have issues.
---
well atm i am rocking a sneak commando build utilizing a bloodied explosive handmade. got full chameleon armor sneak skill at max and can sneak right up to an enemy and pop em once and kill em in one shot. on a level 90 deathclaw with a crown i can kill em with 3 bullets. got nerd rage and adrenal reaction going at all times  with full commando perks and have my handmade with a tweaked automatic receiver hitting for around 380 combine that with my sneak attack bonus of 2.50x. with all this im rarely seen and can take down the imposter sheepsquatch and regular sheepsquatch pretty fast.
---
I quite enjoyed listening and reading the about the brotherhood.The free states are also kinda cool.I also really enjoyed reading about the mining companies Garrahan and Hornwright.
---
Then you should have made that clearer in your post. 
---
Just search for anything with ''bloodied'' or ''junkie''. Like bloodied rifle build. That's the 2 most common things I read in here.
---
Im level 8 i dont know most of them
---
They also will go wanted and attack people to trigger the aoe mutations and make them hostile to
---
So... Can you get to main screen? If so crank every thing to a minimum. And i mean everything.
---
I got the game to run on integrated graphics card with 4gb system ram.
---
Turned down the resolution to absout lowest and the game was blurry... But smoother then my gaming rig with settings on high lol.
---
Sorry I assumed and that is always wrong :(
---
Your name is kind of on point...
---
West tek and huntersville brotherhood stuff is good to learn a little more about the sb
---
You only get 56 special points altogether.
---
never said you were wrong tho ;o
---
Ok, when you go tobthe armor bench there's no option to apply such paint? I guess you have the armor crafted already. I have the same issue with the clown knife here.
---
Maybe you could just get good at pvp and adapt this is the nuclear wasteland not a preschool spend time getting better at pvp instead of spending hours at your camp
---
I’m just trying to start a flame in your heart

Honestly I think a system combo of Borderlands 3 and Division 2 would work better. So gain Legendary script like you get Eridium and use that to buy Legendary Modules, couple that with Flux so there's a actual reason to farm it and couple them both to build the Legendary gear you want like the Division2. At least then blueprints would serve a purpose. 
---
But this would only work if the nerfed a few of the more out of control Legendary affects. But I think it would    re-invigorate the end game. Legendary creatures give you script I stead of dropping random shit.
---
I think it would be win-win-win; Bethesda fixes end game and no longer has to get grief for RNG being broken and we win by actually getting to build characters we want. 
---
In order to not make it so old Legendaries aren't OP you finally implement the 4th &amp; 5th star and make the old Legendaries Legacy.
---
True enough maybe then, riding Mr Fuzzy gives you a de-buff such as dysentery then it would be pay-to-poo!
---
We really need a scout armor helmet. The Brown Pilots helmet from the atom store looks pretty good, but it changes your face so I have no beard and it triggers me, even though I play almost exclusively first-person.  I did not go to the trouble of building a full forest scout set modded back when it was random to find the mods and you didn't know what part they modded, to not have a quality matching hat.   Damn it Todd!
---
Favorite intro love the pull away reveal of dc
---
So, from a few words you can tell how "worked up" I am? Just because I'm passionate about this subject and I think it's worth bringing the topic to a public forum, I'm automatically "worked up"?
---
Again, your ignorance is showing.
---
you can force pvp if your target has unstable isotope, electrically charged or plague walker. not sure about the last one but I think it also works with the strangler heart PA.
---
people are also spamming pumpkin grenades as the rad damage will kill idle players, apparently.
---
I downvote anyone who uses the phrase “immersion breaking”. You’re sitting on your butt in your house playing a video game talking to a guy named Erectasaurus and his pal Dynamite_Dan20. Get over using this phrase.
---
I had a scorchbeast and a mirelurk queen attack at the same time and there was a guy with just a 10mm smg buying stuff at the time, had a great time up in the rafters picking away at them.
---
Not having obtained one I did not remember it is an Atom shop purchase, then as I put above a de-buf of some sort to quench the pay-to-win outrage.
---
Some childhood communicative disease would be appropriate, measles or whooping cough.
---
There is that delay in scrip machine. Be nice If it was last 10 items turned in. Plenty of people would love this unyealding stuff but I don't want to spend my day on the trad ing sub. Found an AA25 assault rifle in there once. 15 scrips later and it was mine.
---
The Dense armor mod on my Scout Chest works fine, I quit using fireproof since it mitigated enough.
---
So you think you can set prerequisites or minimums on how someone forms an opionion?
---
Slap damage doesn’t exist anymore so this is not possible. You were flagged hostile for some reason.
---
What exactly was wrong with slap damage? And honestly it was WAY less griefy then, than it is now.
---
YouTube has some a few playlists where Appalachia radio has a dj, Spotify has playlists too.
---
considering Bethesda dropped survival and is focusing on pve content, I'm pretty sure they themselves don't care about pvpers.
---
and why should they? survival players make up 1% of the playerbase. at least here on reddit, and this is of the biggest remaining Fo76 communities. there's no money to be made from pvpers.
---
That sounds like some devil tier RNG to have both of those attack at once
---
There are several ticket that have been recieved by bethesda with response about them not woring properly and they have been aknowledge they are inconsistent they are supposed to be 100% not stop working if the sever is lagging
---
Dropping a nuke youself litterally takes 15 minutes though? Why would you waste time server-hopping instead of doing Silo runs where you get 1. Xp. And 2. Get to decide exactly where you throw the nuke?
---
I'm confused.
---
Oh no god don't look it up
---
Yea kinda completely unnecessary to retcon a dead character we never met, you could just have it one of the people who weren't inplyed to be dead
---
If you want I can nuke whitesprings for you and keep all the ghouls busy. Hell, I'll could even let you know if there's a 3* ghoul
---
Either they're too low level, or it's plain old laziness is my guess
---
Is your comp up to snuff?
---
There's a couple build in able buildings. The ash heap has one that's nice. I just spent a shit ton on making a nice on unrelated ground
---
Shes not a queen but she prosnaps like one
---
The difficulty for Bethesda would be that the RNG that drives repeat game play (addictive qualities of gambling) that generates ATOM sales would be lost to them.
---
I know we're not supposed to point this out ... but it is true whether Bethesda publically acknowledges it or not ... the RNG aspect of video gaming drives sales.
---
you used to be able to 1 shot through it with enough damage stacking, and the posion syringer ignored it as well.  if they bring it back then the SH PA will be 1 shotting everyone that walks through it, similar to the syringer damage (3 or 4 shots but would still kill through it).
---
on top of it your just burning mats of players who want nothing to do pvp and forcing people who want nothing to do with it to be involved with it.  i thought it was clear when they separated the modes that adv players (majority) dont want it outside of workshops.
---
Not if the wearer of strangler armor or user of said mutations has pacifist on. It was a bug for a while but it does not work that way today.
---
maybe collision course or fly swatter there are a few others
---
There already is. The issue is that a simple timer can be avoided with a simple macro.
---

---
I'm thinking about making a trip out next year. It'll be interesting to see if/what gets incorporated with the the Wastelanders's expansion.
---
I remember a group of people trying to kill me with melees. They would constantly hit me while I walked overencumbered towards the nearest train station. It was funny to watch.
---
I theorycrafted a [very optimized rifle/melee build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fc35548&amp;d=c72sg2eh2l71lu2a72lt2se2ss2s40sm0sn0pp2pd2pk2pl2a00cu0ic4&amp;w=p10ev0ii0iq2if2ih2i44at1au2lm2&amp;m=cf9&amp;nw=&amp;n=) while back, when I noticed many players tend to want to use both melee and range weapons (there are 3 unused points in strength, and 4 extra points, which can be used for quality-of-life perks of your choice).
---
yeah. i've done this 3x. 
---
each time rose said madigan was in the cage, that the uplink that he left behind was in that locker to complete the last quest.
---
I have seen ONE player wearing an asylum dress.  But Vending machines are full of them.  I don't get why they are so popular to put in vending machines.
---
Play on pacifist mode. Don't take workshops. Don't accept team invites from random people.
---
It's not hard.
---
Ok thanx
---
That's awesome! I lived in LV when FONV came out. It was cool to see all the locations especially the Stratosphere. We moved back to the east coast in late 07' so I didn't get to see the fanfare to follow.
---
I do all of that.
---
What is slap damage and base destruction?
---
There’s an outfit and like hard hats and paddle ball and stuff
---
I was grabbing all my junk to just hit scrap and make sure it was all base form a while ago. Some dude was workshop exploiting (I forgot I even had taken a workshop).
---
I lost 720 pounds of junk that day.
---
Love it
---
Dont even waste your time. The challenge is glitched and wont count those anyhow
---
More likely there will be 100 spam posts with the same "We wanted NPC's, but not like this" title. That is apparently how this sub works.
---
Cool, I recommend you to post your idea maybe Bethesda sees it.
---
Is survival mode still in the game. I don't see the icon any more.
---
Ok thanks
---
Then they better don't touch the mire
---
I destroy power armor so you have to fall back and repair before you try and take revenge. It is tactical, not toxic.
---
I gave it a nice creepy filter for the loading screen too &gt;:)
---
Then have certain effects do more/less in pvp and then have certain effects do more/less in pve
---
I did not actively engage them, so if I was hostile it was not by my doing and i was in pacifist. Griefers will ALWAYS find a way
---
Edit: unknown about if they turned me hostile.
---
I run a couple of different setup depending on what I'm doing.  For stealth commando I usually just run 5 unyielding.  It helps max perception for accuracy and agility for ap and sneak.  If I'm doing more sneak rifle/sniper I will run 4 unyielding and one chameleon piece.  If I'm running with a group and not using stealth I will run the commando cards and guns with 2 unyielding and 3 bostering for extra tankyness.  I will also run this setup if I think I will be going somewhere that I might be taking extra damage.
---
If your getting started with your build, you might also look into the blocker, barbarian, evasive, dodgy, and serendipity perks for extra tankyness.
---
My solution to workshop jumping LULZ players has been to blueprint a billboard calling them a douche in big light up letters and calmly dropping it on every workshop on the map with my team. So far I get one of two responses.
---
1. They leave the server.
---
2. They run around actually capturing the workshops in order to remove the signs.
---
I have no problem with wasting time and caps shaming a sad sack who can’t handle NW and wants to try ganking people for LULZ.  
---
If you can find their base, nuke it flat. Really it’s about finding ways to make their sad LULZ you’re LULZ instead.
---
You act like everyone came out of  character creation at the same time. People who have had more time to gear up have more gear, it is that simple. NW levels the playing field by making everyone start from zero at the same time.
---
Adventure mode is sorta like a racing game where instead of everyone starting at the same time, you can join at any time, and have to compete with people who are already 5000 laps in front of you.
---
I'm kinda hoping it'll expand the map too but I do t think it will
---
Leader of the pack possibly?
---
The difference is simple, i can relate to and come to care about actual other people who inhabit this fictional world and thus want to help them because i know what i do will change things at least for them. 
---
With the current system i have no attachment to literally anything in the game. So we immunized ourselves to the scorch, so what? nothing changes, we helped no one, we don't even get a buff from it so why do it at all? 
---
Why take out the SBQ? it just respawns over and over and nothing changes in the world at all from defeating it. 
---
Now take helping a small community of settlers deal with a problem  they have, like they are falling prey to the scorch and we bring them the vaccine we made, we can see that have an effect on the world even if its as simple as one sick guy being saved and go from lying in bed all day to walking around town and thanking us as we pass him. 
---
Those kinds of little details make all the difference to my immersion level in the game and its world, and they motivate me way more than just killing the same group of ghouls over and over to farm legendary loot.
---
35 to catch up on destiny IIRC. Doesn't make your point invalid, but D2 is F2P now with the latest expansion being the only one you gotta buy.
---
This is just the treetop camp with a nukashine spawn point that already exists in the game?  So what did you do, add a few workbenches?
---
Agreed
---
Use up steel by crafting ammo. Drop most of everything which requires bulking to sell to vendor bots. Sell most of the rest.
---
Most junk can be farmed in large quantities as needed (and some are rarely needed at all), so there's no need to hoard it. See my [Where to Farm: All the Things](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c9njxj/where_to_farm_all_the_things/) guide, and realize how easy most junk is to acquire.
---
I have to say I disagree, over the past few months we've seen less and less people play the "new" content, less and less nukes, and almost nobody does the raids/burrow or Arktos (when it goes now). 
---
If Bethesda actually believed that RNG drives end game then why did they nerf almost all the good places to nuke and screw up Events like they did?!?! 
---
I don't think they know wtf they are doing, cause they just keep shooting themselves in the foot. 
---
My point is, I'd rather do Eridium runs on Proving grounds in Borderlands or resource and blueprints runs in Division 2. Than nuke 2 places for maybe the shot at 2-3 Legendaries that are most likely shit.  I mean I literally don't even bother going to Whitesprings or Queen anymore and there is absolutely NO POINT in gathering flux anymore.
---
I am sure you are aware, but just in case you are not. That is a pretty rare plan.
---
I only sell weapons and ammo. I have 2 vendors for weapons - one labelled weapons (mixed legendary weapons) and one labelled ‘handmade hub’ which is stocked with 18 different types of legendary handmades.
---
2 minutes? Must have the deluxe model
---
I just sold mine for 2500 caps.
---
Don’t see the point of anything that gives me -2 perception just for a ‘look’..
---
But then I wear a miners hat because of the super bright lamp on it :)
---
Because the trading subs are asking insanely high prices for some of them.....
---
Flanders. Lol
---
your not a clown your the entire circus
---
Please check out my test results in this same thread. I tested this TODAY at the request of someone else.
---
I got it from collision course and once from the farm protect the bot event on thw west side the Forest.
---
Caveat to that, you could still have Legendaries drop weapons/armor if you really believe that RNG drives the game. But maybe still offer the chance to build or hell even respec/recalibrate items. 
---
Cause right now endgame is broken and something has to change.
---
You can test all you want, but you will NEVER be able to test every single variable, therefore your results are the results of your test and your test only, not that of an actual encounter.
---
I stayed at the Stratosphere because of FONV, they really need a snowglobe collection though.
---
Don't know why you are getting rated down. The last 'proper'/classic expansion pack a Bethesda game recieved was Shivering Isles and Far Harbor to my memory, and perhaps Dragonborn if you squint. DLC like Dawnguard, Automatron, and so on can be pretty big, and are fine for what they are, but the former content you can spend a massive amount of time in.
---
There is a reason companies have moved away from the term of Expansion Pack. It comes with the baggage of an entire new storyline, large-ish worldspace, new perks/upgrades, gear sets, npc companions, and is basically making a small game atop an existing game. They also tend to improve on the base too. See the receptions and love for Shivering Isles and Far Harbor to this day.
---
I doubt Wastelanders will be that, even if I would love to be wrong in this case. It's a soft 'rebuild' of certain areas, probably an Automatron or perhaps Dawnguard length and complexity story, with some old areas repurposed and populated, and a few new enemies thrown in. That's my prediction at least.
---
there is a " fallout76prefs.ini " file in my documents/my games/fallout76 or something. youll find the resolution there, could try setting it to 1280x720, might help you launch so you can turn stuff down in settings.
---
That's hot.
---
They'd at least still be useful without legendary's being applied in pvp
---
I do the same and then run past the red truck, that’s the spawn point.
---
to be sensitive about this issue, I'd actually need to emotionally care.
---
and I don't.
---
I took a break playing and just came back so hasn't heard about this. He said some guy came up and punched his base to pieces with a power fist. I saw the mess myself. He doesn't pvp either so is there any way the base could have been damaged by a player? I never saw the dude but my friend was freaking out about him destroying it and I assume he was watching him do it. 
---
Edit: I asked. Guy shot at him and used to enemies attacking base he shot back without realising it was a player, initializing pvp. Guy then went to town.
---
Is that what you meant about special points??
---
Yep me too, found adamantium skeleton to be more useful since everyone seems to have limb crippling weapons now.
---
I was doing line in the sand and saw 2 players I thought would help... in area chat the guy was more excited than a 16 year old looking for prom dresses hoping he’d find the red asylum dress...haha!
---
There's hundreds of awesome things that could happen but realistically we should keep our expectations low.  If big things were coming, ti would have been marketed better.  
---
I would like to have new events replace every single old event, seasons have passed, and real faction dependencies.  But really I expect about 4 events, 3 new weapons, slight weapons rebalancing, buffs to some enemy's resistances, and a small storyline with no real consequences for which faction you decide to talk to/do some menial tasks for.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Hank_Madigan
---
They did change it. Hmm. I’m wondering if they changed Rose’s dialogue too - when she mentions Madigan?
---
Wastelanders is bringing in NPCs and a new main quest line. Definite replay value for multiple characters, and we know there will be side quests as well. We'll have a lot more content than we got with Wild Appalachia, I'm going to get hours and hours of new content from Wastelanders when it's released. 
---
I agree we should have measured expectations for it, but I equally wouldn't worry about it being short like Wild Appalachia or bear bones like Nuclear Winter.
---
I just want to point out people complained about the cap loss long before survival was a thing
---
Not that I need a map extension mind. I still haven't fully explored the current one and I've put in 1029 hours so far.
---
You may not want to believe it, but I am attempting to be helpful.
---
If you want any chance of actually getting to the bottom of how these mechanics are working then somebody has to test stuff. Last I checked, griefers aren't on here posting their methods with step by step instructions. As a software developer I am well aware of testing and just how (un)helpful it can be. Having said that, would you rather just do nothing and hope that it stops? Bethesda isn't listening. Bethesda isn't testing. 
---
As I say over and over, I hate griefers, I live to kill them repeatedly. I am pro PvP but in general I don't want PvP with somebody else that doesn't want it. Sometimes I misread a situation and it happens. Sometimes I see somebody do something with a workshop that I think is careless and I go after them. I have some degree of a moral compass that I try to follow.
---
Rummaging around in the offices and labs of factories tend to find interesting, sometimes funny, sometimes sad notes and messages.
---
I would love it if he shows up as the leader of a new faction of resurgent responders made up of the small number of survivors of the original faction who managed to escape the region before being killed. 
---
Now they have heard that us 76 folks have gotten this whole scorch thing under control and are coming back to reclaim their old territory and get back to helping people like they always wanted.
---
Get plenty of agility points.  You'll want covert operative, mister sandman, sneak, gun fun, adrenaline, and escape artist perks.  
---
Being low hp is not necessary at all, it just grants more damage thanks to adrenal reaction and nerd rage.  
---
However, with unyeilding armor, you'll also gain plenty of agility to vats more, perception to vats more accurately, and luck to crit more often.  
---
Most stealth commandos got 15 perception and 15 agility.  The rest is preference.
---
I admit I was skeptical -  but as someone who raids every day ...  this is a good guide
---
Lmao
---
Nice idea but not for pay content please
---
Wasn't me, but I did this a little while back also, but sans Power Armor.  Was CAMP hopping looking for mods when a Scorchbeast descended.  Thankfully the high level owner was there, but I did my best as a high-teens leveled player with my peashooters and emptied all the ammo I had, in between getting irradiated and inhaling RadAways and Stimpacks.
---
Was a hectic battle and I almost died more times than I could remember, but we saved the CAMP, so I felt like it was ammo well spent.  We gave each other a thumbs up and went our separate ways.  Good memory.
---
I so used to have this issue, I hated dropping stuff thinking "but what if I need it??". Things like wood and steel you can easily get more of. Keep plastic as you can use it to bulk stuff as already mentioned. I know it's going to be hard to let go of this stuff.
---
You can get perks to make your aid items lighter but that will only affect your carry weight.
---
I'm trying to have as high health as possible
---
I agree -- but I think with this being a MMO they could take it up a level and allow the community to create their own in-character DJ entries, and they can review &amp; add them to the mix.  I'd love to hear other people DJ'ing in character.
---
I started as 1H melee/sniper, but after the first L65 SB battle, changed from sniper to melee/heavy weapons (sniper and combat rifle do OK for L50 SBs, but have a hard time taking down the 65 and 80 SBs....or strategic cargobots.  Switching to heavies fixed that.  Also fixed difficulties with 3* SSQ and 3* yogis
---
Stabilized 3 and bandolier for the heavies. 
---
Martial artist, glowsight, gladiator are the main perks for the melee weapons.
---
fireproof1 for SB gas attacks.
---
Nerd Rage2 for general principle.
---
Generally play solo, so only 3 in char (lone wanderer2, tenderizer1) and luck (was bloody mess3, now started genes2 and classfreak1)
---
Primary is a vampire switchblade since L65, with the Gutter as secondary.
---
Resolute veteran and AA LMG are main heavies.
---
I’m in PA, so couple points for batteries included and power user.
---
Overencumbered, packrat and actiongirl help there.
---
Not a perfect build, but good enough that I haven’t changed it since about L70 (I’m L142 now)
---
Well I imagine their offspring will be cute maybe??
---
Travis was AWESOME.  I modded him to be the insecure one always, because it was hilarious.
---
People like you will never be happy with pvp. If they use an explosive weapon u say not to use it. If the use a stealth boy u say not to use it. If they use a chamillion piece u say not tp use it. And youll keep going down the list untill we are but naked no armor and using just fists and say ok now is a fair fight. If u want pvp with no legandary armor or wepons then stay in NW 
---
'-'~LOSTBOY
---
Nudes or heart emotes
---
I have flux, lead, acid and balistic fiber in my stash. Thats it. Any junk that I need for modding weapons / armor or repairs to my camp I collect on the fly as I need it.
---
You don't need that stuff, get rid of it.
---
so they fixed it? I never have those three mutations on so I wouldn't know. my strangler set never set anyone off though, so I guess they must have.
---
Might be a case where most people got their basic needs met and are finding less good stuff to spend caps on, so they sell less, which makes it harder for other people to find stuff, and so on...
---
Camo paint is bugged and can’t be applied. Bethesda is aware. Should be fixed in the next patch
---
“Half-assed failed abortion” 😂😂😂 That’s funny!
---
Really??
---
Not to my knowledge. From a lore standpoint, it doesn’t make sense. 
---
And I’ve done that, in PVP with the cannibal execution, nothing.
---
I wish cannibal and carnivore stacked... Be beautiful.
---
Yea my friend ate me instead of heal me and got scaly skin I have scaly skin
---
I had previously read that it was fixed. I attempted to test today and it appears to be fixed. I'm willing to admit there may be other variables required that I did not properly test.
---
Check this out for all of your bloody stealth commando needs (via Captainoob): https://youtu.be/6k_iq2f2UQw
---
Bullshit. I played for six hours on two servers (crashed once) on the day of that naked mothman one and the event didn't pop up once. Not sure what the timer is, but it's way too long.
---
Oh man I am so sad that if you uninstall the game you lose all your photos. I had to reinstall windows and when I came back to fallout every photo was gone.
---
Scrap junk before you put it into your stash box otherwise itll weigh a crap ton. 
---
If you go east of the big green area everything will be level 40+ a lot of the time. 
---
Dont go to the scorched earth event until your a little higher level.
---
Idk maybe there’s a chance but he didn’t have it then ate me and he got it. He also has some points in luck so that might do something
---
So this challenge isn't working for anyone else either? It's like during mothman week and the mothman event would not pop up no matter how long we were on the server.
---
I encountered a pair when I took on a workshop.  The first did the stealth pay-caps-instakill, and the buddy was hanging at the respawn point, he then did the same thing as soon as I spawned back in.  It was pretty lame.
---
They'll also wander into town and eat you. Don't fuck with polar bears.
---
If there were enough players in Survival to actually affect the kind of change people are reporting here, they never would’ve shut it down. It was phenomenally unpopular. 
---
There were only a handful of Survival servers running at any given time. The odds that those handful of players are impacting your game as griefers now are incredibly slim. 
---
The griefers aren’t from Survival. Griefers never left adventure in the first place. They’ve been seal clubbing and exploiting mechanics all along. Correlation does not equal causation. 
---
If people were in Survival exclusively, they were either grinding for the XP bonus or liked PvP but specifically made the effort to play in a mode where it was 100% consensual. Neither of those things fit the profile of a griefer.
---
Tbh, I avoid FFR in automatic weapons.  I suffer lag damage problems where half doesn’t register.  I only do FFR with semi auto.  
---
But your mileage may vary.
---
Two shot does about the same damage to the SBQ as a non legendary, due to each projectile being approximately 65% as strong as the one its would otherwise fire, and therefore gets mitigated more by the SBQs high armor.  
---
Two shot is bad vs tanky targets, and thanks to it generally missing squishy targets with one or more projectiles, it's bad vs them too.  Two shot is bad.  
---
If your damage per hit is lesser than the target's armor rating, anti-armor can be almost as effective as bloodied albeit without the risk of the associated low hp. So AA ffr is good vs the SBQ.  And ffr is about the same dps as explosive.  
---
AA FFR will serve you well and allow you to maintain a safer build while getting respectable dps and never hurtign yourself with explosive splash damage.  
---
It can still be doubled though (compared to high hp), by abusing adrenal reaction and nerd rage buffs.
---
I do believe you are trying to help, and if my comment seemed otherwise, I apologize.
---
I am not angry with the pvp players or even those that killed me. It's the mechanics of a game that is about "Rebuilding America" that allows janky pvp mechanics to exist and remain that frustrate and infuriate me. Survival was a good idea that was poorly done and should be revisited. I had thought many times about joining it.
---
It's when PVP griefers take advantage of a system that is flawed and the developers choose to turn a blind eye.
---
There was a time when I had my workshop contested (1-2 weeks ago, and I am aware that is open pvp) by a group of 4 players, that I gave up and left the workshop boundaries and they were still able to kill me, outside of bounds. I accepted that death and travelled just outside of the area (billings homestead was contested and I travelled to Silva just beside it.) The workshop then was taken by them (no longer contested) and they were still marked as hostile to me (red arrows above their heads). And then they proceeded to kill me again.
---
There are broken situations within this game that are very hard to test, and there are ways that Bethesda can remedy them with a bandage until it can be solved properly.
---
Ie: In cases of workshops, PVP must take place within the bounds of the workshop. If you are outside of it, you are outside of it.
---
With pacifist, make it so that, not only do I not damage other players, but other players can not damage me.
---
Fallout 76 is a game that comes from a single player history to a MMO style RPG. There will be bugs. There will be complaints, but there needs to be progress and adjustments too if they expect this game to last.
---
Let the players kill me, IF I shoot back. If I am idle at my own camp, on pacifist, I should live.
---
Here’s Captainoob’s stealth commando build: https://youtu.be/6k_iq2f2UQw
---
Why would you bring a hammer to a gun fight, though?
---
My camp was attacked by multiple scorchbeasts at the same time. I quit for a while after that. I was only level 26.
---
That happened to me once, I didn’t know what was happening
---
I'll never understand people who get baited into pvp and claim it's "ruining" adventure. 99% of the time it's your own fault.
---
keep pacifist on. don't take workshops. and that's it. not rocket science, you know.
---
someone tells me they finally fixed mutations and the strangler heart PA, so the only oversight currently is rad damage. and maybe explosive weapons, but I don't think there's much that can be done about that.
---
This is a common baiting tactic; bounties pay out better in adventure mode, and PvP was not identical/levelled in Survival and Adventure modes. If you did not pick the location and target of the conflict, assume you are walking into an ambush. If you see a 5 cap bounty wandering the map, do not take the bait.
---
I've been lucky, I've only seen one true griefer in the game so far. Everyone else I've run across has been cool.
---
It's personal, but this is the build I run with 100%.
---
Ground pounder
---
Master Commando
---
Tank killer
---
Tenderizer
---
Frog legs
---
Pharma farma 
---
Bloody mess
---
Honestly, the auto combat rifle is one of the best auto guns in the game, and it comes from blue crates. 500 range, tight bullet spread, and high accuracy. If I find one, it's an end game for me.
---
Auto guns run 60-86 dmg without chems or boosts.
---
I made a NW specific character, and at 118 Overseer, I gained 105 levels in adventure, and 35k+ caps. Run&amp;gun has serious advantages over hiding that most of the stealthers don't ever see.
---
The fabled golden goose!
---
 Bring back survival pre patches where you drop 12 caps yes I liked the double caps but I willllll always attack workshops in adventure mode for the easy loot you signed up for it stay in pacifist if you don’t want to PVP I could beat you with a level 25 benchmade 50 cal in power armor buddy your build sucks deal with it you will never ever beat the PVP build not ever now stay in pacifist you food build
---
Then they get cranky af 🤣
---
This goes both ways!! I'm low-ish level (34) and I was being chased by a scorch beast when three guys that were 150+ came out of nowhere and saved me!  They even dropped me some stimpacks and ammo.
---
I love this community!
---
Play as you like. It is an mmo and there is daily limits on scrip and caps which can be aquired through in game vendors. (Along with the Vault 94 rewards) 
---
However you don't have to get these to play. You can just play periodically and enjoy the game when you can. You won't miss anything by not logging in daily. Feel free to treat this like a single player game.
---
Agreed, to an extent. 
---
Survival become unpopular, as far as I am aware, as Bethesda continued to make changes to it. The more they "fixed" it, the less popular it became was my understanding of its death.
---
It's something to be said when in the past 5 days (since survival left) I have had my camp destroyed by someone shooting it after picking my extractor (did not engage me, but proceeded to use a handmade explosive to decimate my fusion extractor and then my generator) attacked while walking down a road in the mire by a group of 4 players, contested at workshops (that's ok, but there is a higher volume) and killed while idle more than I have in the 6 months prior.
---
It was likely the radiation. Any radiation can give mutations. 
---
Once though a friend with a game gun, died from eating him because too many rads.
---
It plays the way you want it to. Im lvl 150 and haven't launched a nuke.  I spent 40 ish lvls just looking at things and running away in high lvl areas. From the time i was lvl 20 -first meat week i spent all my time in survival avoiding players and occasionaly meeting new friends to fight off the train station campers.
---
Will you be competitive in pvp right away... No.
---
But the game It's self is ez and built to take a leisurely route.
---
I would like to see the default be pacifist, and then both of you have to choose to go into PVP, just like inviting to Trade.  Then after you both accept, it gives you 5 mins to split ways.  When you respawn, you get to choose to continue PVP, or go back to adventure.
---
Then they can get rid of wanted entirely.
---
Then damn that’s one hell of a coincidence
---
I get bloodied and explosive but why not junkie's? it's the best prefix for full health builds with no real drawback.
---
two shot sucks for the reasons the other poster listed, and you won't get much out of anti-armor either. it's better than nothing, but a marginal increase against heavily armored enemies only at best.
---
you want either furious or vampire. furious will net you the most damage and vampire will make you almost invincible.
---
Hey! Any chance you're around in the next few hours?
---
Buy serums from players. They’re usually 400 caps or less per serum.
---
I dunno, I was exploring, ok looting some buildings in a town to the south west and heard some weird snuffling thumps noises and opened a door to be met by a really *really* angry wendigo. Even at a reasonable level that was a close fight in such close quarters!
---
There's usually snallygasters up north in the toxic valley and more monsters than you can shake a stick at north of watoga!
---
That sounds weird. I'm around for the next few hours of you're on lol
---
..do ts ,sz
---
I got stuck at 2 of 3. Seems others have said the same with scorched thing this week.
---
We will see NPCs, new weapons, new side quests, more main quest, new mobs, some changes to existing locations, and more Atom Shop items. It is likely, as with all content, that new bugs will be introduced (consider the instancing bugs around the vault raids, and that NPC areas will rely on instancing.) I'll say this; if you don't like 76 now, it's unlikely that Wastelanders is going to be some sort of "now I'll enjoy this" epiphany for you. This game is ultimately a theme park, and if you can't entertain and/or soothe yourself and your expectations, it's likely that your resentment will return.
---
My camp is located near white springs between riverside mansion and the  fissure site.
---
I never put much work into my camp, as it's a pretty safe place. However during free play week,  new players kept running towards my camp to get away.
---
I ended up building my camp up, and hanging out to save the new players. I got four in an hour once.
---
Only one player stayed to defend my camp with me after luring the scorchbest there. They were reward with better gear and supplies.
---
I do. And I did. I bought around 16 serums, and multiples of them for my other 2 characters (value of around 2-3k per character depending on what I wanted)
---
Oh then I should get online as soon as possible to play it! No I'm on Xbox one  man 😕
---
In that test, did you test for camp destruction by chance?
---
This is a great idea.  Or just strip the legendary effects, so a three-start marine armor piece is just a marine armor piece when vs players.
---
It plays largely like a single player Beth game far as progression and non-linearity.
---
There are daily vendor cap limit, at 1,500 caps. To show how easy it is to reach the daily limit: players can log in, collect purified water from their water purifiers they've built at their camps, and hit the limit. 
---
 You can always make more with player vending at your camp. Total Cap limit is 30k per character, which isn't high. 
---
Scrip is another currency specifically for random legendaries, and also has a daily gain limit and upper limit. 
---
You can buy anything in the game from players. And there's no centralized pricing, so you may find God-tier weapons from cheap to max cap limit. 
---
You're not limited from looting high level loot, from high level mobs, you'll just likely need a high level player to kill the enemy npc.
---
There are virtually no hard boundaries to what you can explore or loot in the game at any level, barring Arktos and Vault 94
---
AA doesnt stack well with stabilized, Bloodied FFR .50cal is the best choice for SBQ, also Junkies FFR very good too. If you want to maximize DPS you have to go with these weapons. Of course if you dont want either of them AA is your best bet, but its far from best dps.
---
Wow that’s a lot of mutations. I’m kind of picky with mine.
---
Only thing I could think that someone would miss out on is the free atomic shop thing every week. But otherwise, yeah, there's no pressure to keep up.
---
My main is a mute whore lol. My alts all have scaly, chameleon, bird bones, marsupial, and healing factor.
---
Then each one has build appropriate mutes too
---
its been a while since i played but dont you still take a tiny bit of damage even when in pacifism mode? i had an asshole shoot a crazy amount of bullets into me and i almost died a while back with pacifism on, has that changed now?
---
This is fine, but the workshops are effectively null and void right now, because PVP'ers look at it as a battle arena.  But there are two uses of a workshop, only one of them is PVP.  And stealth PVP against somebody in a workshop is just pure griefing.
---
That’s cranberry bog life
---
My experience, too. Four of my five armor pieces were bought from player vendors a few weeks ago. Now I think most folks are scripping their legendaries, rather than selling them.
---
Also,you should post your platform...
---
Cause honestly,the community of this game is something like I’ve never experienced before.
---
Almost everyone is willing too help,or team up for mutual benefit,with the exception of a few folks who either RP as raiders,or are just people who enjoy ruinin people’s day.
---
(Although In my experience they are few &amp; far between)
---
But ye,the only reason too get on “daily” would be too just try N not miss out on possible free content.
---
Otherwise,do you.
---
Sometimes I’m social,other times not so much.
---
I check the Reddit daily so as too not miss out on a free atom shop item or something,but otherwise just Rock it when I can.
---
(father of 2,wit a wife who loves her attention paid proper,&amp; rightfully so)
---
My 2 cents,
---
Stay Blessed!!
---
The workshops are broken.  Yeah, it paints a target on your chest, but that doesn't mean the player went to the workshop to get ganked, or even PVP.  Maybe they just want to build and explore the workshop.  But PVP'ers just assume everybody at a workshop wants to PVP, because hey, it's a ~workshop~battle arena.  But it's not.
---
If you get up on the roof of the golf club &amp; drop down on to the green &amp; white striped awning you can stand there at the outside of the window looking in to the second floor. All those ghouls crowd the window and get blasted into meat piles.
---
Didnt say ruining. I dont mind PVP, if I shoot you and you shoot me and you kill me, good job.
---
But if you start shooting me and I do nothing AND have pacifist on, how did I die?
---
Not the screwssss, so hard to get
---
You won't have much luck explaining that to classic fallout pver; afaik there will always be a large chasm between those mindsets. Must be a fear of virtual death translating to a fear of one's failure. Or something similar.  
---
Basically, if you pvp, you don't really care about dying (as it will happen pretty often).
---
Na it’s cos u get rads from cannibal so when he ate u he got rads which means he had a chance for mutation, but if he had lead belly  on then I don’t know what
---
It's broken.  It is not an invitation to PvP, it's an invitation for somebody to challenge and take over the workshop.  HUGE difference, so stop the argument.  If players actually did a real balanced battle for a workshop, it'd be /awesome/, but they don't.
---
There should be a cool-down period from paying caps to go PvP, and actually being in PvP.  During that time (a minute or three), both players are highlighted on each other's screens.  Plus, it shouldn't be allowed during quests in the workshop.
---
Anybody who treats Workshop PvP like a quick way to get thrills by doing an inbalanced sudden attack sneak attack throw down is just a griefer, plain and simple.
---
Essential perks if you don't want to play stealth, but still useful as a stealth build:
---
Dodgy - Ag
---
Serendipity - Lu
---
Nerd Rage - Int
---
Blocker - Str
---
Radicool is a no brainer, once youve used it, if you are keeping your health low with rads.
---
I'd also look at Unyielding (^+3 stats the lower your hp) and the armor that increases your defense at lower hp
---
I apologize for killing off your brothers and sisters.
---
Foodsplaining: telling someone how they should play a game that they paid for, or trying to alter the game to their tastes. Most foodsplaining happens after a large junk drop at a workshop. Also, its beyond easy not to die on this game from pvp. Its baby mode compared to other online games.
---
Mashallah brother
---
That's great, honestly, as long as you don't try to sneak-dome the workshop owners.  Fair combat is great.
---
I would like to see an "invite to PVP" just like invite to trade, and then flip the default to pacifist for everybody, and you have to choose to live dangerously, and even more to PVP,
---
Wendigo on the road below Abbie's bunker severhop and win while watching a show or something
---
PS4?  I kind wish I ran into your Server .....
---
Let's go kill some stuff!
---
Edit, and what ammo are you using? I remember trying to find ammo was hell at that level
---
Hey whats up.. Just looking to team up I know its not the right spot but fallout 76 fans will see it... I run into people that either just dont respond or just dont follow through for those that are willing to help me out on raising my xp im level 46 fam. Im a Scorpio... And I like to slay murklurks and cook by the C.A.M.P.fire call me old-school... As rediculous as i may look as an avatar on 76.. I assure you I am truly that rediculous in battle... Yet here I am... Level 46 with no friends... So please join me in my endless quest to be something I am not in the real world... Im just Kidding... Unless thay makes you want to join me... Im soo lonely.

Zombie_king_211-
---
PC, sorry
---
I could see him being the leader of the Raiders in Wastelanders. You know that guy in the trailer with Maxson's hair.
---
Uhhhh.......what a total moron.
---
You do understand that FO3 and FO4 has unlimited stash right?  You do understand that this game is based off FO4 code right?  You do understand that the reason why they won’t expand it is because the game will crash and run shittier right?  You do understand that the reason everything takes forever to spawn in when you load is because of said bad inefficient code right?  You do understand that many other games support tons of stuff right?  Like Eve-Online which allows you to have loot in every station in every solar system and all players exist in a single shard of the game...
---
So yes you can call a stash cap and camp budget a design flaw.
---
Shouldn’t you be crouching around FO76 like a total tool right now?
---
How do you know they make up only 1%
---
This is what I'm wondering.  I don't want to sell anything cause it won't be there to sell when i want to replace my caps that I want to spend .... that I know I will spend .... but I'd prefer to spend it on something I want, rather than another unnecessary Power Armor mod/plan that I don't really need.
---
+karma thank you so much you just made my day!
---
Pity you're not on PC; I'd love to claim your workshop... for the thrill of fight ;)
---
Just carry a bloodied melee weapon. I would avoid PA, but feel free to slap a suit on in a pinch as long as it has emergency protocols mod. [Here is a commando build for ranged VATs crits.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3d643cf&amp;d=sg2p00pg2ph2pi2pp2eh2eo2c72ir2la2lr2l71lt2lu2lv0ar2an2ao0a00a30a12&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=)
---
I think with junkie you have to keep a good stash of chems/alcohol and suffer debuffs. I have a Vampire 50 FFR cal which I’m always using, but with PA and stimpacks droprate I’m loosing ttk instead so I need a 2nd weapon for dps :)
---
Thanks, very informative
---
How does this have only 27 likes? Best post in a long time.
---
Ive always wondered if the ham radios have any point
---
Can you expand on how AA is loosing its benefit because of  class perks? Is it the same with rifles cause they have penetration perks as well?
---
Dense works better
---
Is it like plasma grenade plan rare?
---
there was a big poll a while ago. you can probably find it yourself and I don't remember the numbers exactly, but the vast majority played adventure exclusively and a considerable number played adventure + NW.
---
few people played NW exclusively and survival came last, by a **huge** margin.
---
I sell em. Have a couple left I think. XB1
---
That's wild. I literally did this quest a couple weeks ago and it was for sure Madigans body.      I'd be super pumped if he came back
---
Yup! I remember White Springs having bags all over the place! Same with Watoga and now nothing... 
---
I use to grab them and give them away to low levels...
---
In the split second that it lasts to jump, how do you manage to go into inventory, and then drop the gun?
---
I only need 2 more. Gt is Titan Atlas1991
---
West tek, take everything then sell to vendor
---
And how much do you sell them for?
---
I measured stabilized, 45% armor penetration equals 24-26% damage increase, with a .50cal. AA another 50% armor penetration, but they dont add up with stabilized to 95%, it get only half the value from stabilized perk. So the actual armor pen tops out around 72.5% which is only about 36-38% damage increase overall. If you on Junkies, you get raw 50% damage bonus from the 5 addiction, and another 24-26% damage from stabilized, and thats way better compared to AA. Dont know about the rifles, im only using heavys.
---
Also FFR is the best choice, for SBQ because the queen ignores most of the explosive damage. I deal the same damage with my BE .50 just 25% slower compared to my B25 .50
---
 Thanks, I'll be sure to try it!
---
Thanks man. I play on xbox but I get what you mean. I got 4 leaf clover maxed out and plan on getting critical savy maxxed out as well.
---
Most is by far Player Vending. Not so much selling but buying. Nuclear Winter would probably be second most played. Did Meat Week mutiple times, The Burrows 2 or 3 times, Encrypted/Free Range quite a few times. Got some good use out of The Purveyor, actually splendid use as I got my favorite weapon from her. Did a fair bit of Pioneer Scouts too.
---
Fasnacht got me into 76, played the beta a few times and was bored and I didn't even touch it release day, was too busy with RDR2. However when Fasnacht came around and I heard about the communtity aspect and rare masks that you won't be able to get again, it triggered the collector in me. So I created a new character and gave the game another try. Love it now.
---
Nuka Shine I didn't do much because I was catching up on all I missed with the vanilla game and new things were still coming out. I did the main Nuka Shine quest and one daily. I actually want to do more soon.
---
Arktos Pharma I tried 3 times and failed all 3, without a team or 3 or 4 it's a real pain to get through, so not a huge fan of this one. Did buy the coat though from a player, again thanks to the Player Vending. Never touched Vault 94 or Survival. Surival simply isn't my thing and I heard Vault 94 has a glitch where you can lose your whole character or all your stuff in your inventory.
---
I believe so. Maybe one level down, but I traded a bunch of serum recipes for mine.  I would put it at the 25k minimum trade value area, which I believe is similar to the plasma grenade.  IMHU
---
Was foodsplaining a typo or am I missing something
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f22bf9&amp;d=s01p02ph2pi2pg2po2ek1c70ic4ir2s12an2ao0a04ar1a80a51a30lk2lt2l71lu0&amp;w=pd2pp2pl2pr2pk2iq2if2au2at1lm2a71&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=Captainoob%27s
---
I found this aswell. Its pretty same i think, can i use melee with these?
---
I saw this earlier lol. Its similar to mansplaining. How haven't you heard this btw? Its everywhere on fallout 76 stuff now. It perfectly sums up someone who does strictly pve trying to alter the game to their tastes.
---
Serums sell for a good amount. Up to 500 with the right charisma and perks.
---
I just pick up all the junk and food I can find, bulk up the junk and cook the food and sell it, it usually gets me to the daily caps pretty quick am Di can do it as Im doing whatever Ive got planned :D
---
They use those for pressure plates for some traps. It’s probably already been triggered by the time you get there though.
---
500. Only 1 left. In my vendor. GT same as username. I’ll be on for about ten minutes
---
Camp is SW of Vault 96
---
So...buy a serum recipe for 18k caps then, yeah?
---
Hey, sorry, I only just saw your last couple of messages. It was lovely to have you visit my new cultist camp! I'm building it for Halloween but am not entirely settled on the location yet so may move it tomorrow! Stop by if ever you need anything.
---
We love guns because a country's ruler thought it could take all its colonies money without giving anything back. We fought for our freedom. Stay away from our guns, boys country, even our own, will ever subjugate us again without our consent.  Yes I'm aware of our political climate. Still ours. This is a gaming forum. Leave you political opinions to yourself. Yes I know of the irony of that statement.
---
Yeah that does sound fun. There’s a lot of great pvp potential for this game.
---
Any luck yet with the old witch costume plan? :-)
---
by the way, I crunched some numbers in the calculator, and an ultracite gatling laser is roughly 10% weaker than a .50 cal. I don't know if it's counting the innate bonus against scorched, though.
---
from there you can extrapolate the legendary versions. with all damage perks, bloody mess 3 and stabilized, and assuming the secondary is 25FFR, TS deals 1% more damage than AA. maxed out, furious deals 20% more damage than TS. vampire deals 30% less damage than TS, like any non-legendary weapon would, but you get immortality. and for comparison, junkie deals 25% more damage than TS. furious may seem like a better options considering the 5% difference but remember you need to get several hits in order to reach the 20% mark.
---
Depends on your level. Very hard to cap out at low level. If higher level, say 40 or 50 plus, hit mutant strongholds like the penitentiary, Grafton Steel, West Tech, the ski lodge far north, Winding Path, General's Steak House, and Huntersville and grab all the guns, especially lasers and assault rifles . Sell to the nearest vendor using Grape Mentats and/or Bargain perk card for getting the highest price. Mole Miners shotguns from running Blackwater mine and Pleasant Valley can get you a lot of guns, too. I can cap out doing just three or four of those in an hour. You'll probably get a decent number legendaries for scrip that way too.
---
Yep I play that way. I don't like VATS in 76 so tend not to use it 95% of the time. It's how I play most games that are first person.
---
Don't forget the carnivore mutation!
---
I agree.  I think most are faced with selling it for caps, or selling it for scrip, and scrip wins.  I try to put legendary stuff in my vendors even if it is also good for scrip, just for that reason. But there are also a lot of total crap legendary drops, that nobody would want.  I'm also limited on space in my stash, so I am deciding if I want to keep one item or another.
---
Actually, it'd be really cool if they let things you have in a vending machine have a lower weight.  Then I'd keep more in my vending machine, rather than sell for scrip.
---
It would be great if there was a way to leave a tag on your player dot on the map that says you are open to trade, even if you are across the map from your home.
---
On the wishlist would be that they open up an API that allowed us to link to our inventory from a website, so people could browse it and then join a server when that player is online.  I'd code something up like that in a heartbeat if it was available.
---
Yep me too
---
You sound like you’re staging an intervention for me. Lol
---
Always. I use vats everyone and a while just to hit tiny fast shit like ticks but I have no vats perks or legendary effects. Everything other than the tiniest most annoying enemies is fpv ads and even they're sometimes just grenaded.
---
Enemy weapons, in large amounts. Times used to be when you could do Uranium Fever easily and sometimes by yourself, and Hoover up all the Mole Miner weapons to sell or scrap for loads of steel. Nowadays there's too many people one-shotting enemies so you can't get a hit in. Other locations will do, somebody mentioned West Tek and it's great for weapons and xp but the enemies are always high level and that might not be ideal for some
---
each one after the last 4 patches, i was really hoping it would work. And it's the same for my buddy who;s used his alt character as well just to test.
---
Same here. Don't know if I'm just lucky or what. I was in Whitespring the other day and some 100+ level guy and his buddy tried to shoot me. It did dick even though I'm level 20. I just stood there and am like "wtf, guy? I'm just trying to rummage here."
---
If enemies are dead already, server hop.
---
If someone keeps shooting you, put passive mode on.
---
95% of players are very kind, and I rarely even run into other players tbh. When I was trying to complete my last main quest I was struggling to down something that was flying around because I'm a melee build, and some dude/lady came and shot it down. I'm not sure if it was because they wanted to steal something or not but it benefited me because what I needed wasnt taken, so whatever lol. 
---
Regardless, just server hop until someone isn't there or the enemy you need respawns...I understand fallout has a specific fanbase but 76 is a mmorpg, and that just cant be changed.
---
I don’t know how it happened I dropped my controller and I somehow was able to jump and drop my gun. It’s hard to explain but I’m so confused and angry about this
---
Yeah that does sound pretty amazing, you describing that gave me an instant flashback to Blood Gulch from Halo.
---
I just crunched some numbers for you. and regarding junkie's, addictions are now permanent. so you only need to get addicted once. and someone compiled a list of "minor" debuffs that aren't as disruptive, like -chr.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/
---
Well and you know... ones that resulted from super mutant mating... is that a thing?
---
Fusion cores
---
Or you can buy serums for cheap on the market.. or you can buy a recipe for 10k on the market... it’s an investment. Next time I won’t make a suggestion and anger the scrubs.
---
&gt; It is not an invitation to PvP,
---
Yes it is.  And the person holding the workshop has the advantage, since they can build defenses.  It's literally a castle-defense game mechanic.
---
&gt;Anybody who treats Workshop PvP like a quick way to get thrills by doing an inbalanced sudden attack sneak attack throw down is just a griefer, plain and simple.
---
There is no griefing in game anymore since slap damage was removed, except perhaps for kiting mobs into player camps.  You're whining about the intended effect of a feature. 
---
And I say that as someone who has been running Pacificst since day one and hates adventure mode pvp.
---
Making prime ammo
---
It’s to make stable flux which is used to craft various mods certain camp items and ultracite ammo
---
There's two deathclaws by either fissure site prime or the fissure site west of it has a dead Deathclaw that drops a hide probably 70% of the time for me.
---
In the original PVP implementation of the game, even if you hadn't agreed to PVP by responding back to the player who shot you, you would still take a heavily-reduced amount of damage from that player. Essentially the difference between being slapped vs. being punched with a Power Fist. 
---
This resulted in people still getting killed without having agreed to PVP, because other players figured out builds or had legendaries that enabled their weapons to deal enough damage to kill the player despite the damage reduction.
---
Bethesda eventually changed it so that outside of an agreed-to PVP situation, players who shot you dealt zero damage at all. 
---
In the original  implementation of CAMPs, players could damage and destroy other players' CAMPs even if they weren't in an agreed-to PVP situation. Bethesda changed that too, so that unless you were flagged as in PVP, players couldn't damage your CAMPs.
---
Persons like BrainCeps want those changes reverted so that, as the game was at launch, even if you don't agree to be in PVP via an established mechanic they can still PVP you with tangible consequences, whether you want to or not.
---
That’s sweet. Perfect for Halloween
---
Probably around Thanksgiving.
---
I used to. Then I got addicted to vats. Will prob go back for the challenge
---
Not sure. I came back and the fighting was over. They just proceeded to jump around and rotate who chameleon t bagged my corpse
---
Most higher level mods will require stable flux of 4diffrent kind, violet,yellow cake, cobalt and crimson. You also need high radiation fluids and hardened mass from killing baddies in the nuke zone 👍🏽
---
Edit since you’ve picked it up already you can see in your chemistry bench under Nuked Flora
---
How do i make this ammo - not at a normal tinker’s i suppose?
---
I'll shoot you an invite tomorrow!
---
It’s at tinkers but you need prime receiver plans from the Scorchbeast queen
---
What are springs usually used for?
---
No. You're still wrong.  
---
Just because previous fallout games had unlimited stashes.... In a single player setting.... Doesn't mean the reason it's limited in 76 is because it's a flaw.
---
"I like to craft and vend".... Your words. 
---
Yet you can't fucking figure out why, on top of the survival lite elements, that having a limited stash in a multiplayer setting is important....
---
Where players trade....
---
And can sell....
---
Do you know what a game economy is? Now ask yourself, how is trading and selling going to be at all viable if everyone can just have a stash of unlimited everything?
---
I love when someone calls me a moron, and doesn't have the basic critical thinking skills. 
---
Not to mention the fact that the vending tied to your stash, helps spread out the ability for players to have business at their camp. Why visit a few different camps? When one guy has 300 weapons. 500 armour. 56000 junk. 56000 ammo. 
---
For fucking real. With unlimited stashes, your play style of craft and vend. Which is also mine, would be obsolete. No one is buying my ammo, nor is it worth selling because the market is flooded and its worthless.
---
well, first max hard bargain perk. next, head to west tek and slaughter super mutants for their guns. sell guns. cap max hit. easy peasy.
---
been doing it since new vegas, always liked the sneaky sniper gameplay it's fun
---
If a non-specific reference is enough to make you defensive.  Perhaps it's a sign to reconsider the stance.  There are more violent countries in the continents of America.
---
No worries. It's looking pretty cool so far! I'm not sure why it didnt award you karma. Did I do something wrong?
---
I will
---
I use VATS when I absolutely need a crit but tend to stick to regular aiming most of the time
---
Yes. However I do suggest teaming up occasionally, it’s a lot of fun and will allow you to do raids which are fun when you feel the need for a new challenge.
---
A such a place to have peaked in life.
---
Thank you! I'm afraid that I have no clue about the karma system - I'm still (relatively) new to the ways of reddit!
---
My gt is Titan Atlas1991
---
Seriously? I can craft these, feel like I’ve been able to forever. Had no idea!
---
&gt; I dropped my controller
---
I'm glad you didn't jump in real life, you could have lost the controller too!
---
Yea. Once you learn the plan. You can craft in your throwing weapons section of the weapons bench.
---
I mean there’s a ton, mistress of mysteries for me has a pretty awesome story/ lore
---
Pharma farma is one of the best low level perks. Available in luck at level 1. Just get it up to the third tier and you'll have plenty of stimpaks and disease cures.
---
Scrap everything, you get plans for crafting mods and a bunch of junk. Start selling weapons once you have enough mods.
---
Do the Uranium Fever event, wait till the end and then loot everything from every meat pile. When you leave kill the rest of the mole miners in the mine and loot everything from them. You will be over encumbered but the Whitesprings Station isn't far away. Kill anything outside and loot them as well. Before you head to the station go to the cooking station and turn all the glowing meat into Glowing Meat Steaks. Head to the vendor and pop some grape mentats if you have them and equip the max Max Hard Bargain perk. Sell all of the shotguns and rifles and mole miners gauntlets you looted and if the vendor has any cash left sell those glowing meat steaks  for 10 caps (w/ 5 charisma and Hard Bargain).
---
Max out hard bargain, make a bunch of MIRV grenades go to vendor take grape mentats, sell MIRV grenades. I've made tons of caps doing this and I sell the excess grape mentats I have in my vendor. This makes me even more caps.
---
Cover shot for Premiere Edition of Scorchbeast Monthly?
---
They need to restructure this whole shit. Make it how it used to be, but with notifications we can toggle on and off, possibly for specific events. Let us start public events whenever we're in the location, with a 30 minute cool down for each and a public notification. The way it is now is atrocious, but one positive thing is that events have good attendance, although Uranium Fever is a clusterfuck
---
I'm actually going to quote myself from another thread rather than type it all out again.
---
&gt;I'm of two minds.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;My  inner over-enthusisatic and every optimistic child says that 90% of the  team could have spent the last year with their nose to the grindstone,  rebuilding the game in such a way that Wastelanders is effectively going  to be a New Vegas scale addition grafted into the world organically,  with a long main quest, multiple deep companions, smaller factions with  long dead favorites represented (Fire Breathers, Order of Mysteries,  Free States,) led by NPCs we never find the corpses of (Abbie for one),  new waves of content already partially made and ready to drip feed over  time, and that all this work is why it's looked like the game has been  updated, fixed, and ran for the last year by the janitorial crew and a  single intern.  
---
&gt;My inner cynic says that Zenimax wasn't happy with just *how bad*  the reception was, and most of the team got distributed to ongoing  projects, and that the game is actually ran by a skeleton crew (also  explaining the issues they seem to have fixing the game and implementing  the simplest of fixes in a timely fashion), and Wastelanders will be a  three hour with fast travel main plot, a handful of existing locations  programmed with new notes having their spawns replaced with human NPC  enemies, and some barebones to passable companions because they know  (from the popularity of companion mods) that this is what their fanbase  get really into. After this the game slowly slides into it's death until  it's just small circles of friends playing on private servers, the rest  of the community having moved onto newer and more well recieved  properties and titles like Cyberpunk.  
---
&gt;We'll know in ~~a month and~~ a bit less than a month.
---
For the record.  I don't believe the guns are really the problem.
---
If you had a proper universal health care system that helped people with mental health issues I'm sure your gun violence would drop.  Sane people don't go on murderous rampages.
---
Same here.
---
Mine's the same, ps4
---
I found a yellow mining lamp that can be displayed but has no picture in the pipboy. It's pretty sweet. Can someone tell me where to find an unscorched oven mit?
---
I've died and killed many jumpy players in my time and it always spawns a bag floating in mid air. Make sure you check the area well.
---
This also happens to mobs sometimes and you need jetpack or marsupial to get above to loot.
---
Yep you guys arent subjugated at all. Tooootally free and everythings fine. Lol
---
I live a few hours away and have hears that Point Pleasant’s Mothman festival is really fun and quirky in a good way. The whole town goes all out for it
---
It goes pretty well with the ragstad outfit and fantastic with the patched suit and a knife. If only chainsaws were viable...
---
A liquid with ions is called an electrolyte.
---
Brondo, the thirst mutilator.
---
Violet flux to make calibrated shocks for power armor.
---
Flux also used in making your own fusion cores, fusion generators, the decontamination arch, and prima ammo.
---
Pretty sure there are other uses as well.
---
Not even on deathclaw island?!
---
Now you need to make your character gaunt and demonic looking and scare new players just before the overseers camp
---
I'd definitely love to go check that out!
---
You assume you think I want unlimited.
---
You cover for Beth’s poor limitation of stash because of economy lol.  If that was the case then vending would have its own stash.
---
This game doesn’t require an economy to stay healthy it’s just something to do.  A game like Eve would die or have to drastically change because the economy is like 90% player built.
---
Despite the many challenges with FO76 it’s a good game I’ve enjoyed it......just want to see a little more stash.
---
Stop being mindless fanbois coming to Beth’s defense it’s border line pathetic.
---
This will get your Jimmies rustled....
---
Bethesda I will pay 5000 atoms for a 200 stash increase.
---
Depends on the weapon and the sights. I like to use the hunting rifle in fpv, the 44 too. The shotgun Is good for tpv, and the automatic rifles go great with Vats. Melee Is third person View always because I cant hit shit otherwise.
---
I personally show people around to share knowledge and give them more options to improve their game. I find satisfaction in helping. I don’t want anything in return.
---
If you share that same knowledge with someone else, that’s even better.
---
I went because the game showed me what cool places there were.  The asylum was one of my favorites.
---
Alternatively if you are lower level, I would recommend hitting up the prison near the Grafton Dam. Lots of super mutants and while they are lower level and carry the less expensive hunting rifles the volume will make up some of the difference. Loot all the prison collars you find too they don't sell for much maybe 1-2 caps but you can find at least 20 of them IIRC. If that doesn't get you close enough server hop and clear it again.
---
Killing a stingwing or a cave cricket or a radrat with a semi rifle with no Vats Is such a challenge, they should give you atoms for it.
---
AA -28% avg (depends on armor) best all around
---
Furious- 45% after 9 hits (best for tanky)
---
Executioners -50% last 40% of health. Haven't tested this much but at a glance its around the same as furious but geard towards less tanky mobs.
---
FFR =25% dps
---
Explosive=32% but need the 5 cards. Good for thing's like vamps.
---
TS is arguably the worst now due to high debuf to accuracy... Two shots so two times the armor resistance on mobs.
---
One case where TS is still epic is on launchers. Auto gernade/missile/fatman all pretty much need TS to be viable.
---
It’s gone for now.
---
Uranium fever Is good for that, mostly because there's a vendor really close.
---
I love the fact that because I can play within the limitations of a game's system, and effectively manage an inventory, I'm a BGS fanboi.
---
The economy isn't necessary for the game to be healthy? Sure. The game would exist without it. 
---
But without an in game economy, vending machines are immediately pointless. 
---
Look at what happened with a sliver of the player base duping huge numbers of high end weapons. Weapon prices crashed. 
---
When you allow players to have excess of everything it will kill any economy the game has, in turn killing the trader playstyle. Making vending machines obsolete. 
---
I'd never sell a single bullet. My most popular item. 
---
You know what gets my jimmies rustled? The fact that the education system can't teach children the basic concept of supply and demand, and the consequences of having one of those things out of balance.
---
I'm seriously peeved they took out survival mode because it was one of the few ways I still enjoyed the game. It was more stable for one, and the feeling you got when another player was around you but you couldn't just look on the map was thrilling. It nailed what I thought 76 was going to be, a test of other players humanity and modern morals. Was the level 236 player a potential ally or another raider coming to steal your junk. NW has done fuck all for me in a fallout sense, and adventure mode is fun but nigh unplayable at peak times and with the recent event updates the only real fun I did have is plagued by overpopulation.
---
Bloodied builds boost all your damage. Melee will be fine, but will never be optimal. You will still see better numbers than you do non-bloodied.
---
Correct.. What he is saying and what I will echo right now .. is we registered enough damage to get the loot off the dead queen. We didn't die at any point in the match nor after when rewards came and no flux was awarded. This has happened to me several times. PC. Note: it's almost always during a super fast run where someone shows up and slaughters her in the first three minutes. Again, we are not dying, we are doing enough damage that we are looting the queen, but no flux is being awarded.
---
I think this is fair.
---
It’s the fact that you’re too dense to see that the only reason why we have limited stash of 800 is because the servers can’t handle it.  lol
---
Oh well have fun making 5mm and .50 cal.
---
You can make fusion cores with a 115% rating if you have one if each at chem bench and right perk cards for higher %
---
Serums need different flux as do prime ammo, armor upgrades and shielded underarmor.
---
What snake oil salesman sold you serums for 10k???? Also as I said in the last foodsplaining post above this one, its beyond easy not to die on this game from pvp. Not trying to sound mean, but it seems like most people who post this stuff have never played an online game with pvp. You are spoiled in this game compared to the brutal worlds of other games. You literally cant take damage with pacifist unless you have a workshop. Workshops would be horrible without someone being able to take it. I'm not letting someone hoard the Salisbury steaks for ten hours.
---
Player: Oh boy, a fax!
---
Fax: Look up.
---
Player: Huh? *Gets obliterated by nuke*
---
All slugger perks, all gunslinger perks, bloody mess... Nothing special. You could go full Stealth with that switchblade, but that would mean using agility points which you need for gunslinger.
---
You mean Fort Defiance ? 😉😂
---
Haven't played 76 personally, but an interesting response I saw on a Fallout sub years ago was that they can be used as breadcrumbs.  Since the vast majority of radios you find are turned off by default, turning them on allows you to mark locations you've explored, assuming they have a radio.
---
This is happening to me frequently. Did the queen die suuuuper fast?
---
Yes. I will have fun crafting ammo. And selling thousands of it.
---
Have fun boiling issues down to one cause that fits your narrative.
---
Plain sack hood looks like a Halloween costume... or you can make it one!
---
In game yeah but irl is the Allegheny Lunatic Asylum
---
A lot of those guys never left adventure mode, survival was too much for them. So we can't really blame the removal of survival for the toxic nature. Everytime I come across people like this I just use the sick emote and let them waste ammo. But when people tell you, "bRo jUsT uSe PaCiFiSt mOdE" it's true, I've never had a bad experience with toxic players simply because Bethesda does in fact have a counter to their sort of behavior, just make sure you always have pacifist mode on if you're just playing for PvE purposes.
---
When this happens, you get 5 minutes to drop another item in order to merge the inaccessible bag with a new one.
---
Where can I get serum plans besides buying it from vendors?
---
Foodsplaining is a new, nonsensical word. Forgive us for not hearing it before. Google barely knows and thinks you meant mansplaining, and the hashtag of it on instagram has a gigantic 12 posts. It also makes no sense. Mansplaining is explaining from the point of view of a man, albeit condescendingly, so foodsplaining is explaining from the point of view of food? In the context you used it, an entitled pve player is...food? Still not making sense there, guy
---
Depends on your level and perk cards really, grape mentats and high charisma helps in a huge way when selling and buying. 
---
Farm locations and enemy for items and sell, sell, sell!
---
Wish I would’ve known this
---
They can make permanent nuked flora, just like in Vault 94.
---
It raises the barrier, so that you have to use a macro instead of just putting a wad of paper in your keyboard to hold the spacebar down.
---
I know, I was just being silly. I didn't know it was available to tour. If you don't mind, what did it cost to visit?
---
I bought a multipurpose axe with extra damage to ghouls, faster swing speed +1 strength for 40 caps. I still have it, even when I found an instigating faster swing one. I love them multipurpose axes...
---
Maybe next you can tell us all how the only single reason WW1 started was the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. That and that alone. There were zero other factors that contributed.
---
We got it after all. Perfected the run we now reach reactor with about 5.50. Reactor is still our time sink but whatever.
---
The story is fragmented and spread all over the map. It is hard to find the story and harder still to digest it in the right order.
---
Your best bet to get the lore immediately is to read the notes/holotapes text data on the 76 wiki.
---
Lol, dude how many words are nonsensical that we use every day? How are you justifying mansplaining and saying foodsplaining is a no go? It's perfect for describing people who build their perks horribly for qol (food perks, thru hiker etc) and then rage when they die in pvp. So yeah sorry, but it works. If this is you then I'm sorry.
---
If you make serums, you have to farm for all of those mats. High radiation fluids, glowing mass, hardened mass, and raw flux.
---
Look up mappalachia, there's a map of magazines, go to those spots and get them... Panapictagraphist helps
---
The Brotherhood of Steel. And this is why.

We’re all wendigos on the inside...
---
Lots of empty houses you can use. Just take the road and find a place you like, and then, see if your camp can be placed. It Is great fun to discover that by yourself. All my characters use preexisting houses or camping sites as their camps. Explore the map: own that shit.
---
you'll also notice that that is 147 years and Diamond City after all that time is still just the stadium. and the rest of Boston is an ongoing war between ghouls, raiders, and super mutants.
---
I'm going down the route of MODUS going Rogue with the access to the nukes, but rather than a Thomas Eckhart approach of trying to nuke china, MODUS wipe the slate clean at home so that the true America can be reborn with vault dwellers, but without realising that no Vault nearby is still closed
---
The spawn points are fixed and maps can be found through google. 
---
However, the exact mag that spawns, if it spawns at all, will be completely random. 
---
If you’re trying to complete a challenge, you must find the mag at the spawn point for it to count.
---
Right
---
Nice man, grats!
---
Faster swing combat knife.
---
IMO using any non-crafting crafting furniture should give you a relevant buff. I don't know about adding more buffs because spending a minute to get the 2 buffs is already a time sink.
---
Mr. Fuzzy Ride ought to grant Well Tuned.
---
Sitting in a chair or a couch ought to grant Well Rested.
---
If your on xbox I'll sell you a set of mutation for 1000 caps
---
Oh and I’m a software developer and the fact this game allowed ppl to dupe items and find a secret room is totally on Bethesda and that was a developer that leaked that I formation.
---
You’re trying to justify limits to control bad code that they allowed lmao.
---
Engage your brain.
---
Giddyup Buttercup!
---
Someone showed up with his "pet" and leveled my base the other day, after my turrets attacked it
---
So you are saying go for stealth commando only?
---
&gt; handle the fallout
---
lol nice one
---
&gt; there was a big poll a while ago.
---
A poll on this sub doesn't represent the total playerbase.
---
If the FEV formula is the same (and it probably is), then all WV Super Mutants are sterile.
---
We did all 4 floors for 30 each person, other options were available for more paranormal, or specified tours
---
And that Is why we can't stop playing this buggy mess.
---
No snake oil sales man, just bought a lot of serums @ 400 caps per
---
Turrets kinda suck imo. Besides the bugginess that they have, their damage output isn't all that great. You'd be better off just killing enemies yourself.
---
I'd say look around man, you can find them pretty often for 250 or 300 caps.
---
Try working on that anger problem.
---
I have been having a hard time on PS4 as I only play around 4 hours a day and dont feel like spending it all hopping from camp to camp and server to server
---
Alas, that doesn’t apply across servers, or with other players around.
---
400 was a lot less than the 1k costs I had been finding
---
Oh dang. Now I’ve gotta do a wendigo playthrough
---
Don't do all of this since your max selling price will cap and they won't all take effect, but here are some different strategies for getting your sale price higher:
---
- Max out hard bargain
---
- Shielded casual underarmor
---
- Unyielding set + 20% health
---
- Grape Mentats
---
- Beer + Party Boy/Girl (only slot for this + Hard Bargain if you're going with a high charisma build for other reasons)
---
Here's what I've usually done to max out my caps:
---
- Build a bunch of water purifiers and sell water
---
- Use Butchers Bounty for excess food to sell
---
- Sell excess chems and junk
---
- Get a Top Hat plan, and scavenge Tyler County Fairgrounds for cloth and the Flatwoods region or Treetops for leather (yep it's boring, but keep in mind picking up all the pizza trays and whatnot helps to respawn more valuable loot very quickly)
---
- Use Super Duper to get more of what you craft
---
I can help you find it cheaper if you'd like one night.
---
I would
---
The cost is beside the point now. I have all the serums I want
---
Thank you though
---
I didn’t even know how to use vats till I started playing the former survival mode on ps4. I had to learn fast because everyone else was using it.
---
But the same mutation that I had tho
---
I collect it to slowly save up to make my decon shower.
---
Cool
---
I think from what you're saying, a fix for mutations would be the answer. Otherwise workshop pvp is the only way to be forced to fight and you can farm more without them. They're also the only pvp oriented place in adventure.
---
I am a bit surprised there isn’t some intern available to update the counter over the weekend.
---
I need to do it too!! If someone see this pls. I'm Akumidina in game.
---
it's just logic. this sub is one of the biggest Fo76 communities left, it's the only reason why I use reddit. and along with the official forums, the vast majority of users, around 90%, has never even played survival. you also have smaller communities like other subs, discord servers, facebook groups, etc., and most of them are also pvers.
---
the players who don't partake in online communities are even more casual and definitely not into pvp. it doesn't help Fallout is a singleplayer series. the bottomline is that, regardless of how big this sub is, it's a decent representation of the total playerbase. and that means less than 10% actually cares for pvp.
---
Bethesda wouldn't have dropped survival servers if I was wrong and people actually cared for it.
---
Go to any and every area that spawns super mutons
---
The note at the bottom confirms the name as an error, as Maj. Darion Jones is found dead at Seneca Rocks Visitor Center
---
Welcome to the club!
---
You need the flair though.
---
Oh. I just checked your post history. You argue game theory like you argue politics.  
---
Like fox news parroting trash. Oh sorry OAN parroting trash. Who actually believes what they are parroting is bias free. 
---
This makes so much more sense now.  There's no point in discussing anything with you. You get your opinions and info soley from sources that you agree with, and you take it as bible.
---
America. The land of I'm right, you're wrong, and opposing ideas are not even worth consideration.
---
Changes every season. It is still Nuclear Winter, will change when Wastelanders arrive.
---
I just did the quest today with a new character, after I returned with the uplink from Abbys bunker, Rosie definitely referred to the body as Madigan, maybe they just forgot to edit that part of her dialogue.
---
I use lulz a lot and was starting to worry ppl didn’t get the reference anymore haha
---
Luck
---
Awesome! Great info. I'd definitely consider hitting it up, too!
---
I just clear out blackwater mine and walk my fat ass right out to the whitesprings station, usually takes me two runs, just another option. Not necessarily most efficient, but it’s pretty easy and convenient
---
Calibrated shocks
---
From the market.
---
The meta allows more gear to be viable now. Junkies and Bloodied are fine as long as you can manage the debuffing required. TSE or TSFF are still viable.
---
Wait for the wastelanders wendigo
---
So unlike the two other comments that are off point, I say your claim is legit. Bethesda adds more and more stuff to use in camp with no increase of budget.  At this rate you'll soon  have to scrap every walls and floors so you can finally fit in the nice furniture sets, robots, decorations and all these fancy add-ons. It is getting ridiculous.
---
Yeah, fallout 4 had what your talking about.. I just dont wanna get back to settlements that need My help All the time
---
Only if there were a free equivalent that gave the same buff.
---
Either that, or rename "Well Tuned" to something like "Good Spirits" and have it granted by instruments, the Fuzzy ride, etc.
---
Can probably say the same about the people that turned it into a oasis of friendliness while it's supposed to be a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
---
Market? Like players vendors or train vendors?
---
Throwing weapons will always honor tagging, unlike ballistics.
---
They only scale with Fire In the Hole, but are extremely cheap and don't suffer from the throwables cooldown.
---
Don't worry, have fun 🤗
---
That is expensive for cores, and the lower they are, they tend toward worthlessness due to always being 3lb no matter what.  I live on cores as a vats pa build, which is very inefficient.  :(. But i would never pay more than 50c for a full core.
---
 if your looking at a bloodied weapon thats not equipped it shows its damage without the bloody effect
---
But what about griefers?
---
I volunteer as tribute.
---
We meet at lunch
---
I am pretty sure this was facetious.
---
If you toon is at a low enough HP, the self-damage will kill you. If players spot you sporting 1%, they're going to try their luck.
---
My friend and I will do more testing just to make sure
---
I once found an harmonica after 300 hours of play. And is not a regular harmonica, the details where just beautiful, I have that harmonica displayed on my camp.
---
This game needs major balancing. 
---
That is all.
---
I also replaced my old 2k monitor to new 4k. Textures looks better, but not much. Hope, Bethesda will release HD pack later
---
On PC Its a struggle to even get to the nukezones and have enemies left alive, if you dont rush in like a madman you're too late for the arty and everything's dead, even a lot of the time everythings already dead before the nuke even hits
---
Also, try to disable TAA in config, it looks blurry now
---
Every Fallout since the first has had villages and NPCs that were helpful. 
---
Only difference in 76 is when you choose to be a dick, it's against actual people and not AI.
---
RAIDERS and why. Because there more like pirates taking all they want and need.
---
pew pew lmao
---
Beth doesn't default to the net-ID, but to the Display-Name, which you can change once ever 3 months on the website.
---
As for your question... I named my toons after the build they are using, or "bank \[1..5\]"
---
Maybe give Huntersville and West Tek a visit. Both came with interesting background imo.
---
Look for it in the atomic shop for 9000 atoms. Coming soon kiddos!
---
As a melee player vats can be a real pain because you can't block when locked on. I wish it worked more like a target lock in other melee focused games like Dark Souls. So most of the time I don't bother, except on ghouls and bugs and for the occasional crit. Those things move too fast to do anything else.
---
Thx dude
---
Edit: I looked it up and I'm having trouble finding a map for those, not on imgur or Reddit threads n'stuff, can you link theap or something like that? Thx
---
I saw nice raider camps incorporated into existing windmils, watch towers, bridges.  
---
I once saw a ownt ingame house, that had no camp addition in term of structure but rather an awsome decoration.  
---
The huge NukaCola ad panel is also oftenly used.  
---
I didnt use a house here or existing ingame buildings, but the road fronting Pleasant Valley station to create a crossroad bar-garage camp. I fully built it with two constraints in mind; it had to be fallout-punk themed and had to naturally fit to given environment.  
---
So here is the nukapunk bar. The pic is old but im not at home today. I'll send you better views tomorow.  
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/images/618
---
And replace the Night Eyes perk with a Night Eyes mutation.
---
With so many night/day perks and effects in the game, you'd think they'd at least add a digital clock on the HUD.
---
I worked around this issue by tweaking my monitor's Gamma and Black settings
---
Oh ok, I just wasn't sure if I was being sent back to the same world or not because it would find worlds immediately
---
I play solo pve only in passive. The only time im around alot of other players is during scorched earth at prime.
---
I could fall asleep to that voice.
---
You can kinda do that already the tall concret barricade with somethibg on top makes it really hard
---
What about the colored asylum hats -- are they worth anything?
---
The mothman festival has had more people from different places due to it, one guy was all the way from Texas!
---
I love when Deathclaws emerge from their underground burrows or ghouls falling from the ceiling. I wish there were a lot more. The biggest disappointment was discovering they always come out of the same hole. Some randomness to this would keep players on their toes.
---
thats the thing tho this guy didnt take it, he just killed me, my paper bag was gone and he was to when i came back.
---
You’re a better man than me. I ran a silo site in 15 minutes to try and avoid the crash only to have it happen while I was punching in the code. Haven’t played since. It seems you get a tad more stability if you server jump as soon as you render up and by tad I mean maybe an hour without a disconnect.

I would love it if Madigan came back with the wastelanders
---
Leave the junk in the trunk, crafting usually takes the junk from your stash .)
---
This has been a tactic since the very beginning of the game. Unsure how this is 'griefer tactics as of late'
---
"GRIEFER" no less... when he actively went out of his way to seek the bounty for atoms as he stated himself. And then he RETURNED after being killed the first time. LOL
---
I would say it kind of morphs around however you want to play it, but Bethesda does do little things every week.  Freebies or sales in the Atomic Shop, special events, etc.
---
BOS ftw. Best gear. Best lore.
---
This has been getting increasingly more popular but here’s a story I got,
---
I love teams, I’m a team person. Someone shoots me an invite hell I’ll join.
---
But the other day I was in someones camp and I had spent 150 caps on bulk copper and I was so happy to finally get copper, but my team mate started picking a fight with someone that was in the camp and my teammate got killed so the ones who killed them killed me.
---
Lost my junk and the owner of the camp disconnected from the server along with the person who killed me and the one who was on the same team as me. I’m assuming they were all in it together and it was very well coordinated however now I refuse to join parties of people I don’t know and it really bugs me.
---
trickle some of that down yo..

I used to be heavily VATS-reliant until I took some time off from 76 to play Overwatch and realized my aim was absolute trash. Now I find myself rarely using it. I was never a fan of Concentrated Fire, whereas in previous Fallout titles I was all about those headshots.
---
Not a huge fan of sights but I'm a shotgunner so I don't need them really. What you're describing is possible but the build you'd need to pull it off (sneak, sniper) without getting constantly destroyed by mobs while you're manually aiming is better with VATS anyway. So I don't know why someone wouldn't just build around that while they're at it.
---
Bro stop crying its PvP some people like it just as you like adventure mode deal with it
---
Honestly following the overseers mission takes you to most notable places on the map and her story, particularly the personal journals gets pretty interesting. I also found the raider, enclave and to a lesser degree brotherhood stories to be pretty interesting.
---
Agreed. I'm honestly surprised they've done so many Raider gear when no one in this whole section wants to raid anything and complains the instant PVP shows up in their general vicinity.  
---
I can't believe they haven't done Responder or BoS stuff yet either. Its about a year into the game.
---
This is just another senseless rant for reasons why PvP shouldn't be in the game. First of all, players enjoy PvP, simply turn on pacifist. 
---
Don't take workshops and complain when someone contests. 
---
No, they shouldn't remove legendary effects during pvp. 
---
Most importantly, don't bring your bull here to rant about what others already bring up multiple occasions. Either enable pacifist or simply play something else. Bethesda listens to players like you. The reason why survival mode is gone is mostly because it's dead. Players don't join onto survival for PvP, they join for farming.
---
They need to make watoga worth going to again. They should have put player vending over there, rather than camps.
---
Might've been a pvp concept that got scrapped or mega delayed
---
Yea except they made it to where you don't have to find it and hit the button like forever ago
---
That's kinda my point, they need to revert this feature.
---
We are not much different, you and I... I'd love to run into you out there in the wasteland some day.
---
yeah but i literally just smelted it, so i hadnt done that yet, i was switching gear before putting the last stuff in, this guy came at the right moment, super unlucky for me :P
---
The main three ways I can think of are the Combat Grinder, the Junker and the Chemist.
---
The Combat Grinder finds a spot that has either Super Mutants or Mole Miners.  They slaughter them until until they have enough weapons to meet the cap limit.
---
The Junker picks up everything.  They sell everything they can’t scrap.  They turn all of their scrap into bulk scrap and then sell that.  They tend to need a lot of plastic.  These are the sort of guys who say things like “cat house” and “... high school” in their Reddit posts.
---
The Chemist gathers components and makes money by making them more valuable.  Serums are the best known, but it is also possible on the Mentats path.  1 Firecap pickup becomes 2 Firecaps with Green Thumb, 2 Firecaps become 4 Mentats with Chemist, 4 Mentats become 8 Berry/Grape/Orange Mentats with Chemist.  There are also other components of course.  Super Duper helps.
---
You can mix and match them of course.
---
Bring the legendarys back
---
I like the scorched, they all work together for a good cause
---
Bro dont lie to me right now! Was this like an event around winter or can anyone get it at anytime? All rng with like the tiniest odds I'm guesn.
---
Cool, thanks! I'd hoped e mean $30 /person.
---
Yeah, once you complete “Mayor for a Day,” it’s a pretty sweet place to visit. It would be cool to place a camp in the elevated train off the staircase at Watoga High School.
---
Yes! This! An ice cold Blackwater Brew for you. 👍
---
Yeah, I can get to the main screen. And I cranked everything but the resolution down to the minimum, manually. I did it before I even attempted to play the game.
---
Didn't know about the Morgantown one, I'll be sure to check it out!
---
I always thought vault 51 andnuclear winter is the end result to fallout 76. Vault 51 ZAX captures all of us and nukes Appalachia for his game
---
To be honest, I'm not sure. It may not be.
---
I'm a level 182, and I was helping out a level 10 they proceeded to thank me by dropping some food. Completely useless for a canned food Horder like myself, but I thought it was sweet 😊
---
That's perfect, the only difference with mine is that I've wrote specific details on exactly where each of those dots are.
---
I already lowered everything to the minimum while keeping stuff reasonable for actual play. (Draw distance, stuff like that.)
---
That's the resolution as well, the problem is getting to the character creation screen itself. in other words, actual gameplay.
---
Yeah probably, they should at least make it so theres a timer until you are both flagged hostile or something. So you cant just sit in chameleon behind someone and kill them as soon as you claim it
---
Did you have raider paint on your handmade? If it has custom skin it won't drop just destroys.
---
Hit detection blur. I get it sometimes.
---
I wanted something with more detail on exactly where I could find the dots on the map. You can see on them that there is a bobblehead, but I wanted to make a list that'd show you exactly where to look.
---
No that’s the reason I don’t get weapon skins
---
I've heard that on a few occasions, Berkeley Springs has embraced the Vault Life. It's the little nuances like that specialty drink that makes it worthwhile!
---
The easiest way I've found is running through the Allegheny Asylum. Pay close attention and try to get into every room to get straight jackets. You'll easily gather 20+ if you know what you're looking for. If you have hard bargain 3 and pop a grape menats, you can sell these for 46 caps (maybe 44 caps, I don't exactly remember) each at vendors. There's also a ton of chems you can grab as well.
---
Fuq out of here
---
Just busy the soldier and it will stop
---
Yeah there's nothing I like more than stopping and defending CAMP. I'm only 55 but I try my hardest. If it's near Fissure or Whitesprings it can be tough but I'd want somebody to do the same for me.
---
Bear stack!
---
Crafting power armor pieces, and weapon mods, among other thing.
---
I'd love a free flag to put up that way we can represent our factions!
---
John Wick.
---
Free States since irl I'm a Libertarian. Lmfao
---
Its because most items in the atom shop are scheduled releases and not spontaneous items specific to the community asking for them.
---
Bethesda was surprised we were all getting along and not shooting each other's faces off, they thought we would all want raider looking  specific gear, bloody combat armor etc...
---
How old is your motherboard? Cuz it sounds like there’s a bottleneck. Experience this issue with any other titles?
---
😯 There's a plan to make adhesive?
---
I'd send "We're watching" to random high levels.
---
That would be cool. Apart from the rampant scirchbeasts...
---
I'm not bothered by what the focus is or is not, as long as there is an open pvp mode available for the minority of us who prefer to play that way. Hardcore modes always appeal to a minority, because the majority of people are lazy and weak and would prefer something easy, but I hardly think we should be left out altogether just because of the fact of our inferior numbers.
---
And I wasn't trying to get a reaction out of you. I just genuinely have nothing but contempt for your weakness--even if only because you insist on oppressing people like me out of jealously, or fear, or whatever reason your ilk has for insisting so frequently that we should be denied a gaming experience which we can enjoy. And as far as the monetary aspect goes, are you implying that fallout 76 isn't generating enough income to host even a single server for those of us who would prefer a more hardcore experience?
---
And that it provides a terrible competitive experience is completely subjective. I happen to very much like the experience if you couldn't tell. The fact that most engagements are over quickly is how it should be in my opinion. The notion that someone would ever realistically run in and engage like Rambo in most situations is just absurd.
---
I hope it makes the game better, but I'm running out if hope. I honestly think it will break everything and won't run well. They haven't fixed so many things, and the last 4 or 5 fixes made so many things worse. 😢
---
Your post didn't rustle my jimmies. It's cool for people to want what they want. I don't think you'll find what you're looking for in 76, at least for now, and I hope you find what you're looking for.
---
We can only hope.
---
Stable Flux is a valuable crafting component:
---
1) All Shielded Underarmors
---
2) PA Calibrated Shocks
---
3) Decontamination shower
---
4) Prime ammo
---
5) PA Targeting HUD
---
(I’m sure there are more... )
---
Thank you very much OP!
---
Not sure might add a bit of fun but depends on how much they add.
---
The clothing can alter body types to an extent. My character looks pretty good in flight suit and bomber jacket but put her in the civil war era dress and she looks ten months pregnant.
---
lol What would you prefer that I call you? Herd animal? Ortega y Gasset referred to your type as the mass man. Does that suit you better?
---
I hope that the human NPCs that are coming back won't be broken on release.
---
Acid is getting harder to come by u know that right?
---
If you already know what I’ve said, can you be more specific in your question?
---
I understood your question to be, “Is there a spot guaranteed to spawn the exact title I want?”
---
The answer to that is “No”
---
There are no npcs yet, next month hopefully. The new vault raid was a disaster. I don't think anything good has been added since the pioneer scouts.
---
Free States. Because of government overreach.
---
I'm saying, pick one of the things you want to do, and focus on that. If you go ranged, carry a melee as backup, because it will still hit hard, even if you don't invest perks, because Bloodied.
---
Not really thinking theyll be broken but more of how many quests are we getting and hiw much of it is going to be daily quests
---
I'm on ps4 and the only time I use VATS is to scout the area out and deal with stingwings.
---
I've got so used to playing like this now that when I recently started playing fo4 again I don't use VATS anymore lol
---
Bruh
---
Most here in this group like Fallout and many from day 1. Not sure why haters are here other than that’s the type of person they are that lives on drama and bashing... most likely in real life as well... 
---
Watch, they can downvote all they want but it’s the truth...
---
I want to know about any companions will be coming. Especially if we can get a Dogmeat type animal companion.
---
.308 is pretty rough to get in large quantities for MG users. You could make a killing.
---
"Defending mansplaining"? What, as a word? It already has an established meaning and there's nothing either of us can do about that. I brought it up because "foodsplaining" is obviously derived from it in its layout
---
I hope your not calling me hater, because I didn't make this post for the sake of trashing the game.
---
Why do you say that?
---
SeVeN
---
I'm omw to watch the joker, this has went way over your head apparently. I'm out, have fun.
---
Don’t: 
---
1. Take workshops
---
2. Random team invites
---
3. Trade with strangers 
---
Do:
---
1. Make frequent stash drops
---
2. Learn to quickly leave world
---
3. Make sure pacifist is turned on (note taking a workshop will get yeah anyways since they are pushing this to do PvP.)
---
I was thinking this too, I like raider stuff, but I didn't expect to see so much at once. Freestates, Raiders, Raiders, Raiders.
---
I've tried to make my character fatter, as she's based off of me, but I have to keep her without a lot of muscle since the neck end up too big for the scarf with the poodle skirt...
---
I imagine the bugs will be quite significant with such a large update.
---
I'm sporting this and the clown outfit until halloween.  Might change it up a week with the ritual mask.
---
Being pushed back to 2020.
---
Since someone posts this question every hour, you might try skimming through the sub for those posts.
---
If I were you, I would get into the game now and dabble a little bit so you aren’t completely lost when wastelanders comes out
---
As for build guides, you can look up guides on YouTube, but reddit is also a good source of info(sometimes). I hope 76 doesn’t kick your ass, good luck.
---
If you don't finish the Buried with Honor quest, you will hear it every time you log on.
---
You're doing Mr. Pebbles proud, son.
---
I'm camped on an acid generator.  I used to capture hemlock holes a lot before that.  It was never an issue that I've noticed.
---
Happened to me once, too. He was deep down in the mine part, whacking away at scorched. Poor Chally was stuck in some rocks. Grahm and I finished off the poor buggers and went our separate ways.
---
Well me and my buddies are ammo dealers for the most part and were always running out of gp when making ammo and then we’ll run out of ammo
---
Edit: acid prices are rising for the most part
---
*sigh* it gets lonely in the wasteland...
---
Meat week had drops from most events with acid as one of the primaries. Primarily primal cuts. 
---
Though acid farming is still easy as ever.
---
I totally didn’t realize they still worked when shut down until today. I was hovering around 29k caps and wanted to stop selling so I scrapped the connection to my generator. 
---
Then later I’m clearing out the General and see someone bought a plan. Hurried to another vendor to buy some ammo just to spend some caps. 
---
They really should be disabled when unpowered.
---
What makes you say that acid is getting harder to come by?
---
Workshop in toxic valley has 3 nodes and my camp sits on an acid node. Not hard to come by just haft to take a workshop and defend it or set it so u can get in and out without being seen. If players are finding it hard to get acid I should start selling it, have like 1k right now. Nah i use it to make bullets and sell them.
---
Hemlock holes and snallygasters. I’m swimming in acid....
---
I got a buddy, (he doesn't grief, just likes pvp) and he exclusively played survival as he didn't like how no one defended the workshops to initiate pvp.
---
Now I doubt he'll even get back on the game since survival is gone. :(
---
In that case could i buy some?
---
idk if ur joking, but yeah.  if you flip over to hunter/hunted on the pipboy radio stations.
---
Not at all! Just the opposite! I see you want the game to do better! That’s what I want but you know there are quite a few that bash and trash on here and downvote if you say anything positive about the game.
---
Unlike sometimes previous, this seems to run often on ps4 with pug success...
---
You'll be fine even if you don't play constantly.
---
Level 50 is pretty much the actual level cap. 50 means you gain access to every high leveled weapon or armor possible because the highest level cap a weapon or armor can be is 50. Levels higher than 50 are just for snuff and only serve to show how much xp a person has gained. Going higher also means you can unlock more perks. Hell, I'm over lvl 100 and i'm still trying to perfect my hybrid melee/sniper build.
---
So, you'll be fine. Going solo is still viable provided you know what areas will maul you if you wander in there alone. A level 50 and a level 100 player are considered by the game to be the same thing but the level 100 will probably have more perks, legendaries, experience, etc. under his belt because he's gotten to that level already.
---
Did you even read before you commented? Or did you simply get triggered because you yourself are one of the griefers?
---
Is a 25 percent faster fire rate hand made with an automatic receiver  about as good as it gets?  Is it necessary to have the commando perks that up the automatic fire damage?
---
This game has been saved from the beginning because of the dedicated community that it has behind it, this game was released in a rock bottom state is only going to get better with time technically, but Bethesda might find a way to mess it up who knows?
---
I’m level 106 and still never seen the Flatwoods monster :,(
---
The Enclave. Same reason why I chose the Institute in Fallout 4, they're the only ones with the means to rebuild the wasteland, meaning resources, technology and scientific advancement. Not to mention great outfit style, colour scheme and MODUS.
---
And if we're talking out of game, they're probably the closest we'll get to the Templars from Assassin's Creed, my favourite fictional faction ever. Of all time.
---
I opened this notification and when I read it I fully expected the Tesla Rifle to be to be here with its sound glitch, or a full lobby of explosive weapons being shot at the queen.
---
You should also be able to dual wield. That is all.
---
Fireproof 3 will let you survive a nuke mine, with blast padding you'll barely be dented by it!
---
Lvl 175 - never.
---
I avoided Nuclear Winter when it came out since I was still invested in the main adventure mode. Still plans and recipes to unlock, atom challenges to complete. I play other similar battle royal games with friends separately. I was also turned off by the RNG with perk cards.
---
However I jumped in when double XP started up for it and have loved it. It’s refreshing not having to worry about hitting your carry weight, stash, or caps limit. I wish the warm up/cool down time was reduced. I also wish you could just free roam the vault without joining a match. 
---
That being said, if they are looking to make Wastelanders successful and save Fallout 76, they need to make the game stable. If this means spacing out content so it all doesn’t launch on day one, that’s fine. I’d rather play a game that doesn’t soft or hard lock me out when I’m performing simple things.
---
Kudos to the guy named “x mywifeyourkids x”. Great name!
---
Yeah, fists work so much better in gun fights!
---
I will! Would prefer to not take the pylons as I'm a bloodied build, but I'll give whoever does tank some of my stimpaks :D
---
Also good point about gunpowder makes sense
---
Level 151 - 3. Just happened to have logged off around Whitesprings only to load in directly into a nuke with no PA. That was twice. Then once down at the SBQ
---
Ok, I was just making sure. I hope Wastelanders will make Fallout 76 the game that it should've been at launch.
---
I'll do tommorow when vendors restock I need a few more caps
---
Multiple toons over 200, never. Not a single time.
---
Because when you load in, you have several seconds immunity, enough time to either ft or hop into PA.
---
1k could get you around 5k. I generally get mine sold for like 5 c each.
---
Only if they replace Rose with someone like RedEye. Man, he was the best.
---
Preach
---
I enjoy playing fallout the way it is, looking forward to wastelanders but as right now enjoy it. I will say right now I ate the purveyor that dirty btch has given me a full set of golf clubs which would be great but I dont play gold...lol
---
My real name, cause I wanted to see if the robot in the Vault would say it. He didn't. 😢
---
Nuke mines and Fatman launchers have been shit since the nerf last year anyway! They are glorified fireworks, only useful in celebration not combat!
---
Yeah. Enough Raider stuff. Let’s see some BOS, Enclave and Responder gear. And I have a Free States flag, but I want a BOS flag.
---
Sit down foodbuilds and shut up.... all your bitching and complaining on here have resulted in this bugthesta listened to you.  They nerf pvp they stop camp destruction they limit caps and make a wasteland a happy happy joy joy place and now what?  Still not happy?  Got everything you ask for and still not happy?
---
You toxic bunch break the game because you dont enjoy one aspect of it and still complain you take workshops and agree to pvp and complain you choose to walk around with hundreds of pounds of junk and still complain.  Why not look at your choices and your game play until then please just sit down and shut up.
---
thats intriguing, especially considering how it used to be to cap.  totally favored the defender by making a small area around the workshop deally the cap zone.  just having another human set foot in the zone to set off the counter-cap might be cool.
---
I loaded up on acid the first meat week, 1000s of it. So that was my main goal for this past meat week. I like to use lucky hole mine for lead ore, but without the acid, the ore is useless. I couldn’t play as much this meat week, but still got over 300 bulk acid from it.
---
Named my beta character "Beta" since I didnt think it would carry over. Started a new character anyways since I thought people would see beta as my name. Ends up just being my gamertag anyways smh
---
I had this happen one night I was on my low level just about to hit level 37. I was burning some caps and fast traveled to a guys camp. I was spending my caps when I heard his turrets go nuts and that lovely flap flap of a scorch beast. Well I had just spent like 4K on stuff when the ceiling fell in. This not being my first rodeo, I donned my trusty level 25 excavator armor all my other 4 characters had used and passed down and this being my pistol commando build pulled out my trusty level 35 vampiric handmade, also a hand me down, popped some deluded rad x and went to work. After many many rounds that dirty bat went down.  I took a snap shot as I always do when I take down my first scorched beasts and went to work repairing this guys camp.  I did what I could then took a chance and invited the camps owner to party so that maybe he’d let me join team and repair the rest.  He got on mic and joined team as he had noticed I had bought a lot and thought maybe I wanted a refund or something. I told him what occurred and asked if he’d join party so I could repair more.  He did and fast traveled back.  I told him not to worry about the junk I had used to repair what I could and he dropped me a clean space suit and helmet he had picked up on his travels.  I always repair camps when I have the supplies especially if it’s caused by my fast traveling to there camp.  It’s the worst to come back to camp and have it basically destroyed.  We aren’t all bad people out here in the wastelands.  Yes I know were this real life I’d not last a minute but since it’s not I can be who I wanna be.  I’ve been grieved by to many and choose to ignore it and play like I wanna.  So you ran into one of the good guys I applaud you sir whoever you are.  Keep up the good works!
---
I run unyielding with as much radiation as possible to max strength and carry capacity. It makes melee really strong but it also makes my hits real low
---
E: immunity? What immunity? I’ve died at load in multiple times
---
Just a thanks. For me at least, I'm bored, and I remember the struggle at the beginning.
---
And please, I don't need radaway. My rads are this high on purpose. But I appreciate the thought
---
Yes, it is. 
---
It's not much of a single player at all. You can run through every questline in the few hours you have to play during the week.. and they're not interesting or rewarding. 
---
After that, you'll be spending all your time 'grinding' legendaries.. trying to get good weapons or armor, but the odds will never be in your favor.
---
The farming &amp; grinding is so authentically horrible, that they added the "Purveyor" to the game who allows you to scrap the awful legendary gear you get from grinding &amp; farming for "scrip". You can trade in the scrip to the Purveyor for a random *,**, or *** legendary item, but the odds of getting anything good or worth it is also horrible. 
---
I've cashed in thousands &amp; thousands of scrip (trying for a decent *** melee weapon) and I've never gotten even one. So, after you grind &amp; grind &amp; grind with very little reward.. you then have to grind &amp; grind &amp; grind more of that very little reward for the very small chance that you'll get a slightly better reward, but you won't. 
---
This game doesn't care about content or gameplay, they just want to be able to show their investors how many players are playing &amp; how many hours those players are playing for.
---
Oh.. and the microtransactions. I'm not going to start on that, it's so horrendous that you'll wish you never knew they existed.
---
WOW really I guess there is a demand, i have never found it hard to get but I'm also not afraid to take workshops, sometimes take the one in toxic valley which is great to defend u get a but of resources from the animes plus super mutants and i take the one at other end of map which has gotten me 3 legendaries to spawn when defending. Thanks for the info going to start selling much appreciated
---
Known automatically
---
West-Tek released FEV-infected creatures like the Snallygaster and Grafton Monster into the wild, I imagine they and the escaped Super Mutants from Huntersville and the West-Tek lab did their share to infect other humans and turn them into mutants.
---
6 large purifiers will make 360 water per hour assuming you keep up on harvesting every 5 minutes. If you have good enough barter skills that's 1800 caps worth. So assuming you aren't perfect with collecting every 5 mins you'll end up with about 1400 caps worth of water.
---
Alternatively you can use the purified water, super duper 3, and chemist to make a crap ton of diluted stims and sell those instead.
---
Also each mutation serum sells for 500 each so if you have those plans you can sell those to vendor bots.
---
In that case you might do pictures?
---
Probably a good 20-30k or a pretty fucking good trade
---
my apologies, i was replying mistakenly to another comment.  after reading your original reply the only thing i can offer is that i often cap most, if not all, workzones hoping someone will try to take them from me, too.  but, y'know, if ppl don't want to do fallout 76 pvp, they won't.
---
There is a perk card in perception that makes them make sound. I only need Tesla Science 1, but it doesn't spawn anywhere I go. 😣
---
My PA is named with an asterisk first so it’s always on top of the menu.
---
I want it too, but seriously it needs A LOT more than just NPCs and a quest.
---
Go to tanagra town and kill all the cave crickets. Server hop and do it again. Or the same at Toxic Larry’s with the snallys.
---
Half a dozen times or so, Usually I try to run out but because of login lag I can’t open the map and see where it’s located and since the pip boy won’t respond fast enough it’s usually the only choice I have other than just exit the game completely.  That’s what I do now as soon as I see the sky turn that orange I log after using my quick dial to pop several rad aways.  So far I haven’t died but if it looks to close health wise I’ve just died and ran back in with power armor.
---
Lol.... "We know what you duped last summer"
---
Would be nice seeing some life come back into the place
---
I use .308, .38, .45, and 10, and you are correct, it is difficult to find ammo, I spend most my time searching for supplies to make ammo.
---
This likely means never imo
---
Thanks that's what I was thinking just wanted to make sure, appreciate it
---
Nah, the load in is faster now. I died loading into Whitesprings a few months ago, and I had no “immunity” time. I could hear the rads accumulating as I loaded in, but the screen was black and I couldn’t move. As soon as the image appeared, I fell to my knees, dead. On the respawn, I had time to run inside, remove the rads and put on PA. 
---
Now, I put on PA before loading into any area likely to be nuked. Also good to be in PA to avoid fall damage at CAMPs in mountains.
---
Its a rando spawn. Pray to Todd and RNGesus.
---
That would be awesome
---
Naa, especially for newer players. Discovering a location for yourself for the first time is a part of the experience.
---
lol, acid isnt hard to come by
---
You get it from scrapping cryolators.
---
Ah don' need no mutation...Ah got dis shit....\*swings machete\*
