Why?
---
---
---
And how should he implement it into the game?
---
XD
---
Terrific fun today! Thank you for organizing this. 
---

---
Had a great group that took her down fairly quickly and then some good violet flux scavenging and taking out lots more scorched beasts. 
---
Since I suspect she's not down for good I'd be up for future excursions. :)
---
No way no way. LMAO
---
Found a tightrope and a viewing station somewhere
---
First of all, bloodied builds is a broad term. Let's talk about low health melee builds instead. 
---
The problem with calling them unbalanced is that the majority of damage boosting isn't from the bloodied legendary effect. It's ALL the different perks and effects from both weapons and armor and mutations working together. Most of which don't necessarily apply to melee in the first place.
---
With TSE weapons it was a clear case of legendary effects that were far more powerful than anything else. Low health melee builds are not so simple.
---
That being said, the way to nerf the low health melee build is to nerf unyielding armor. Considering how badass it makes you and how prolific it is, I expect them to drop it to +2 or even +1 to each stat. 
---
Oh shit sorry I missed a word.  Yeah that’s on a combat knife.  Swings really fast,  I was able to take out most lvl 62 charter at whitesprings with 1 hit and no one handed perks.  
---
He is one of the first robots to start on the path of self awareness.  The BOS discovered this and gave him a purpose, they made Phoenix believe there was more then just walking around keeping the peace.  As payback, Phoenix started to handle the store.  This way he could learn more about humans and work towards becoming fully aware.
---
However, then the Bravos took over.   BOS buggered off and Phoenix fell back onto his programming more; Protect and Serve.  
---
Protect the shop, serve the customers and remove hostiles.   Since BOS weren't around the Watoga robots started to take over and Pheonix (being and outsider now) defended his turf.  
---
He then gained a lust for destroying these mindless automatons, this fuels him and makes him seek out targets beyond the boundaries of the shop.
---
One day, with our help, he will be free!
---
Okay thats better.. honestly, i love running bloodied, its a real challenge not dying, makes it more interesting, yes its easy to kill everything in site, but alot of us have the decency to let other get a shot in atleast, you still get the odd asshole tho
---
You are correct
---
scared shit outta me last night and almost got me killed.. had just fast traveled to golf course and soon as i load hes like in my face and as soon as i hear it shout congratulations i see ghouls jumping up in windows and rushing out to me.. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
that bastard. 
---
I’m not sure. Water is like gold to vendors so it makes it easier to attain and more valuable/time. But yeah you do you.
---
Ha!
---
Correct but even people who played in 2018 on consoles can still claim it on pc ironically 
---
I was actually pretty annoyed when someone did this for me. I get it, you're trying to be kind but I made a new character to try and earn everything from scratch, not for someone to build fusion generators in my base.
---
Yeah, I might just be investing too much into the game at one time and asking for it. Just my play style though.
---
Sorry to hear you lost items. On another note its stuff like this that keeps me playing, nothing like the challenge of playing with or against real people to keep the game fresh and exciting.
---
What is IpresentInterval in your INI set to? Interior spaces can run at a much higher framerate, which would cause this. Happened in fallout 4 as well. If you haven't already, set IpresentInterval to 1 instead of 0. Hope this makes sense, and good luck.
---
funny, but isnt this already the case with nuke silos?
---
Thank u for clarifying what I meant hi, this is what I meant by the  "bloodied" term I used. 
---
I just wish black bloat flies were friendly on spawn from syringer, it would be mad cool. 
---
theres lots of leftover files from fo4. afaik its not currently available
---
While this is well written and has shown that I misunderstood some things YOU said, or rather who they were aimed at. (Also thought you and another poster were the same person due to mobile shenanigans.) I was not trying to say parental anger = parental violence. I am trying to say that catching a glimpse of someone's life does not mean you know the whole story.  It's not black and white. It's shades of grey. I don't agree with threatening violence against your children. I do think that a single incident does not mean that the parent is abusive or anything like that. I am saying the parent in OP's post fucked up. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. It seems that instantly condemning a person based on one action is the norm. Have I lost my shit with my kids? Yes. Have I crossed the line and said something I shouldn't have? Yes. After the fact my child got an apology and an absolute effort to change. All I have been trying to say is just that. People fuck up. One incident doesn't make OP's "parent" todays Parent Hitler. What if you got life imprisionment for a fistfight in school, or for making a risque joke, or for threatening someone out of anger? I'm obviously exaggerating but it's just to make a point.
---
I’ll try and organize something like it again!
---
Yes but most people don’t drop nukes everybody I believe will join in on the dlc. Just a thought I’d like to see other legendary affects get some love. I’m a bloodied build I’d be kicking myself for all the troubleshooters gear I’ve sold to vendors if this were the case. 
---
Not a fan of Pharmacist or Dromedary. I’d drop those. 
---
I’d look instead at Sun Kissed or Solar Powered or whatever removes rads, and think about putting more into Fireproof. I’m not sure I’m seeing the theme here - Radicool plus lots of things to remove rads quickly? If you’re planning on being high on rads and running Bloodied / etc. you want to rethink a couple of perks.
---
I personally try to decide “Power Armor or not” pretty early for each character, and stick with that mostly. I wouldn’t bother w/ Power User if you weren’t planning in being in PA often. One rank is not going to help much if you find out you are in PA all the time and run through them fast, and unlikely to be needed if you only use it for nuke zones.
---
If you plan on using VATS, you absolutely want Concentrated Fire. 
---
You’ll also want Gunsmith and Makeshift Warrior, at least while you’re leveling to mod your gear. I don’t see the other Quality of Life perks (Chemist, Weapon Artisan, White Knight, Super Duper, etc. etc.) so I assume you’ll pick those up and swap in as needed. Same w/ Glow Sight for later bonus damage in nuke zones.
---
Fair enough, lol.
---
I just had a pair, one with a bounty one without. Came up to my workshop as soon as I was done. Bounty guy asked if I could clear his bounty, I asked if he needed a stash. Second guy crouch walked to workshop, claimed and killed me while I was in my menu. Then proceeded to say "get killed bitch". Lmao. Pvp in this game is the biggest joke ever. Know what I lost? 25 caps and a server hop. What did they gain? Satisfaction I guess? Idk. I don't get it. Real life must be hard. 
---
I FOUND THIS ACCIDENTALLY YESTERDAY ABD MADE MY BROTHER FAST TRAVEL TO ME BC I GOT SO EXCITED
---
caps lock is broke
---
Probably Green Thumg, Chemist, Weapon Artisan or Super Duper. 
---
I just want to think you were so excited you wanted to scream it
---
I haven't tried it yet, but wasteland whisperer or animal friend could make this a viable pve build.  Just pacify/tame everything and kill them with a bloatfly barrel syringer.  Then pacify/tame your bloatflies, and place your camp wherever you want an army on demand.
---
Ive been there at least a dozen times and have never got the quest to trigger. Is there a trick?
---
Repair that bad boy to 200%!
---
Said no one ever, amirite bois??????
---
Enclave armor is missing the 'ma' keywords in the ARMO records.
---
You cannot apply mods to it until this is fixed.
---
This is also true for the robot armor upper limbs.
---
Both have been reported and the devs are aware.
---
Enclave armor/weapons are not currently in the legendary tables. 
---
This proves innocents are getting banned. https://youtu.be/zzcvTjXEElc
---
Nice! I'm going to have to figure out how to screen grab (I'm sure it's easy but I've never looked into it) so I can share. I have a completely enclosed house in the river with a hole in the floor for the water purifier. Split between living quarters and crafting area with a front patio right over the small waterfall and a rooftop patio!
---
Thank you, I will try it. 
---
Could be because of the “secret ending” rumored on YouTube? Something about nuking the three nuke sites other than the queen at the same time and then after the one hour nuke cool down nuking the queen to close all the fissures. Maybe they were trying to do that and didn’t want interference. Still shitty behavior on their part. If that was the case they could have given you a heads up. But as someone else posted, they all had to be working together. 
---
Ah dude I wish I was on pc, would for sure be able  to find a solid Group to take her down. Hopefully next time will go smoothly! 
---
Did one today, right at 15 minutes and it was a fairly mixed group. I went in as a solo. Queen damage was pretty consistently and steadily dropping.
---
I brought my fire axes, an endangerol Syringer, a cryolater and a limb damage shot gun. When the queen was up, I made sure to tag her w/ the Syringer. There was at least one other guy w/ a Syringer. I’m sure I wasn’t the only one w/ Tenderizer loaded. I ran out of cryo fuel, so that didn’t help much. Didn’t bother w/ the shotgun as it wasn’t needed ... progress was steady. Somewhere. Near 14 minutes left when she went down. High count I think was around 9-10 of us. This included at least 1 30-ish in Excavator who if he wasn’t doing much was at least trying hard and in the mix. He couldn’t one-shot most of the scrubs, but wasn’t shy about chasing them down with a few axe-strokes to the head. 
---
It could have gone the other way though, I’m sure. 
---
Tell ya what, throw on a bloodied melee. Don't spec out for it. Don't gear up for it. Then go run west tek and lemme know how op it is when your done. Lol. 
---
Not to beat a dead horse bc several other people have already said it. The balance is the effort it takes to make a legitimate bloody build, and the risk that comes with running around with health rad capped at 30%. 
---
Pre nerf tse didn't require a build. Just a gun. You could wreck everything with a tse handmade and not have a single perk card applied for it. It should always be a combo of weapon, armor, and perk build that make you and what you're using op. Not just the weapon alone. 
---
That’s the point of the queen tho. Can’t just show up with 20 people and basic weapons. She is the end game boss
---
I found a hollow log with to Tessa rifles and it just south of vault... 94? The one at the very bottom of the map.
---
I think it’s bra size anyone can hit the vendor cap limit in a day so you need other ways to make money..? 
---
That is weird I would go to any paper bag dropped lol a little goes a long way for me.
---
Got it! Thanks, Fort Defiance can feel like a maze and I never tried hard enough to find that one 
---
100 thousand rounds....
---
The Civil War Top Hat is the best vendor item. With 4 charisma and hard bargain 3, they sell for 32 caps. 6 hats + 2 purified waters sells for exactly 200 caps. This is a very easy way to make your daily caps even if you don't play much.
---
Farming the plans is a pain. The best place for me has been running between 2 spots in the forest. One is just Southwest of the overseers camp near a gravel pit just off the road. You can also sometimes run into Graham here. The other is just northeast of relay tower EM-B1-27 near the gravel pit on the road and smal house with armor bench.
---
Let me know if you need help finding these spots. It's best to run with a few friends. You can each look for the civil war reenactor to spawn on your own server and then join in on each other and all loot the corpse when someone finds it. Good luck!
---
What’s the reasoning for your argument?
---
Will probably be PA builds for their high durability and damage resistance.  Hard to speculate though we don’t know what they will be like so trying to prep a build isn’t feasible. 
---
ok, you got me there I'mma try that
---
No, it’s a civility thing.  The game content isn’t aimed at anyone and is fictional, but shouting curse words at someone is basically a verbal attack or harassment in the real world.
---
Just be civil.  It’s not hard.
---
I agree we have no clue. Could be a vault full of cave crickets for all I know. 
---
I hate those little bastards 
---
*Conveniently cuts the video before getting banned*
---
Okay, guy.
---
That's the only way to do it!
---
It’s not the word itself, it’s being uncivil to other players over a game and shouting at each other in anger.
---
I agree, but haveing a build can do over 1000 damage is in my opinion is slightly overpowered.
---
Do you happen to have the plans? You would use a weapons bench. 
---
You can use the toxic goo to give yourself a portable source of radiation damage, which you can then use to limit what your health goes up to, if you go to the west-Tec facility you can collect it and keep it in you    
---
Supply and demand. I make as much stable flux as I can every time a nuke drops to free up stash space. Shop owners are doing the same and there are A LOT of sellers. 
---
Hopefully she put on enough sunscreen, because an atomic blast might leave a burn
---
I think those higher level enemies are roughly balanced around characters with ideal or close to ideal perk and mutation loadouts using properly modded high tier weapons. What kind of build do you run?
---
I run a VATS crit pistol build and can one shot most enemies that aren't boss-types with a crit to their weak spot using a non-legendary revolver. I build a crit after landing 3 hits. So far the only non-boss enemies that dont go down fast are gulpers. They seem to be able to take more punishment than super mutants and robots.
---
If you get on top of that trap and hit the plunger you can launch yourself like a catapult too!
---
Part of my teddy bear load screen collection. My favorite is one bent over with stitching for an anus and another looking through a magnifying glass at it.
---
If he is on PC, as a mod. My current in-game mod-map shows where all resources are, where all workbenches are, where every vendor is located and what faction they belong to and also shows possible power armor spawns for quick access to Fusion Cores. Also, it is in 8k, so zooming in is not a problem. There are multiple different mod-maps, including Fallout 4 style and military map style.
---
You need to have the plans unlocked. Once you do you can craft them at a weapons workbench under the energy weapons tab or ultracite tab if it’s an ultracite energy weapon. You can get the plans for the laser pistol at the watoga super duper mart.  And Gatling plasma/laser and plasma gun plans from the enclave armory vendor. 
---
thanks for the tip
---
Exactly.  Economics. Makes stuff so much cheaper than trying to buy in game.
---
yeah hiker and tp are amazingly helpful i can carry tons of food and meds, i also use 3 star good with salt, pick up all meat cook it, lasts almost a week see someone in need i can load em up with tons of the non perishables i carry since all my meats last so long, i regularly supply friends or people i run into with 20-30 cans of dog food ive collected. also helps to keep a stock of cranberry relish to pass out to people before we hit nuke zones or mob heavy areas.. free xp for all.
---
my best qol thing since i am pve mainly, is armor bonuses, got three for weapon reductions so means i can haul around a ton of weapons during nuke zones and such, add in some junk/meds weight reduction and very seldom have to worry about vendoring or hitting a bench in the middle of something. sad thing is i cant use power armor most of the time cause as soon as i lose my weight reduction armors my carry weight jumps up to like 7-800 over my 200 ish carry weight lol, but it works for my sneak sniper build dont use pa all that often.
---
As a PC player, i've never run into kids in Fo76. I guess they prefer consoles \^\_\^
---
Personally hoping for a vault full of aliens. 
---
best way to farm whitesprings is to use a bloat fly syringer. 
---
Lmao! 😂😂😂🤣🤣
---
So a lvl one should be able to fight a SBQ? How does that work? You do realize enemies in previous games had levels as well right? They just didn’t show it to you. As you leveled up other enemies got more health, better gear, etc. they would get harder to match your level and gear. This game, because its multiplayer, lets you bump into high level enemies before you’re ready. That’s all. But they always had levels. You just couldn’t see the actual number
---
I run a typical non bloodied melee build. I see what you’re saying about building your perk load out but I wish I could just use whatever I want, especially on enemies significantly lower than me. On higher level enemies, unless you use weapons related to your perks then you feel like you’re doing very little damage
---
Ive learned that the game is not really about the quests, so since level 20 im just wandering around. I had played around 30 hours, im now level 35, 40 hours in and still having fun, the only thing that kills me is that the fps seems to drop substancially after some time playing(from 60 to low 20s). 
---
None of my real life friends play, so I resorted to playing solo. I do like teaming up occasionally, but I prefer solo. All Fallouts I did, very rarely had a companion 
---
F :(
---
Probably a miss programming thing and not lore related but i'll take it.
---
Fully agree.  Yeah, I understand the inclination that "If I am going to be looking at this character for the next XYZ hours, then I want it to be a character that I enjoy looking at.  ;)
---
You can only sell so many components a day to vendors, whereas you can cash in the flux all day everyday with players. 
---
Oh the carhenge with the behemoth in fallout 4 was amazing
---
While 3\* is nice, Stalker's is pretty useless on melee weapons. My advice is to hang onto it until the Legendary Vendor gets implemented and then hopefully get it traded for something good, either for keeping or that you can sell for good caps.
---
I have a few odd pics of my own that I posted in this gallery:

up near the bunkers in the north east of the map, always see 2-3 during a queen nuke.
---
My favorite teddy's is the cooking show in the manor between the toxic Valley and the forest area
---
At least it takes more than equipping a weapon to make it happen. You HAVE to have the right perks and armor if you wanna get those big numbers. I use heavy guns and a bloodied melee. Since armor perks don't apply in power armor, I miss out on the +15 strength you get from unyielding armor. Which makes a massive difference in your melee damage. All I get is the +5 from radicool which requires at least 1/2 your health bar to have rads. 
---
I use a bloodied swing speed pole hook and I can only get it to break 1K with adrenalin, food, and Chem buffs. 
---
Now we’re talking! 
---
Those are great! 
---
Oooh.. I didn't figure that too much. Just figured that's how it would be in real life. I'd help people I'd find. But yeah I can see that now... damn. No one has seemed upset but yeah I can see it being like that
---
That would be fun. Doubt it though most likely robots, ghouls or mutants.  Maybe one vault for each. Each one offering unique rewards and difficulty. 
---
Take your flies on the  Vault 76 door and wait for newbies to come out. (On this outfit).
---
Nah, PC. I've finished the Enclave missions (or got General anyway). So I'll just try grinding Enclave events until I eventually get an Enclave Plasma. Thanks for the offer still. 
---
I love floppotron. Hard nettin champion like 20 weeks in a row
---
Yes it works this way. People hire out to put up lights and signs for people on here sometimes too
---
You had fucking over 100k ammo on you. What exactly is it that you‘ve proven here?
---
Yeah, I hear you. I would have personally preferred the perk cards were more built around character archetype fantasies rather than weapon types.
---
I use pistols (mostly revolvers) because I want a cowboy character, but I'd like to also use stuff like the double barrel shotgun or lever action rifle and still be effective. Just not enough perk points to go around 
---
Tgen you would have ended up with a hour long video.
---
In an indirect way your post just helped me make up my mind to buy one lol. Went to the shop to look at it again, it's on sale and about to leave the shop. Been on the fence about it since you can wear the suit without the helmet now, had to pick one up.
---
One can hope though. 
---
you probably don't even know what i'm talking about. One man can start claiming it and his sweet teammate can immediately oneshot you with crit/melee whenever you want, and you don't even have time to prepare. If you think that's how workshops should work we have nothing to talk about
---
Yeah there’s definitely meta builds out there, especially if you nuke it right and can fight her outside the radiation. It’s still really tough to kill her when 5+ lvl 30’s show up and then even the higher lvls that show up don’t have good dps. 
---
The best way to take her down is definitely have a couple shotty builds and just keep her crippled as long as possible. I’m not trying to diminish your achievements but the people in the lobby definitely play a huge role in how the fight turns out ime.
---
Ive never greifed. Greifing involves chasing  a player to a new server imo. 
---
Pacifists can server hop. The burden is on them to do so.. As they are opting out of a part of the game.
---
I play solo but have met a few in game friends I play with often. Group play is unique as I don’t have to be wit my team. I can go off and do my own thing and when one of us finds something cool we all meet up. Makes for a good time.  
---
It is in the game, but does not spawn anywhere. The only ones out there are ones taken from the Dev room by people who glicthed in there. So, don't buy one if you find one for sale, because they will most likely be deleted in one of the upcoming patches.
---
150000+ just back and forth with only 5040 and both accounts banned.  
---
Love the name! I’ll be on later tonight but I’ll probably miss you if you’re only going to be on for an hour as of that comment. 
---
I found it early-ish in the game on the roof of, MAYBE, a Red Rocket. So probably not too far from Vault 76 if you want to go looking.
---
Yes
---
How did you know they were eating Doritos? Oh that’s right. It was you. 
---
Yeah, it's op af
---
My friends stopped playing way before I did. I kept at it solo until my build was complete, and then I just stopped having fun on my own. I ran out of fun things to do. We might pick it up again when the DLC drops, but I'm unsure.
---
Whent through a couple responder area ealier today, could not find any of their clothes.
---
I play solo almost exclusively. I have met some people that I'll hang around with occasionally, but Ive never really done quests in a group. 
---
Most of the time when I team up, i just come across a new player and show them the ropes, set them up with whatever extra goodies I have then we part ways.
---
Gen 5 consoles now with Smell-o-rama mics.
---
So, if i already scraped them, that's why i can't find any?
---
You can’t just say that and not elaborate on what the hell you actually mean.
---
Could you give me the youtube link? Searched it but only found videos how to get the different costumes and not the plans.
---
I solo about 99% of the time (PS4). I also don't play with a microphone so chat is out. I may join an event now and then with others, or wander into their path for a while. 
---
So to be clear cause I don’t really get what was happening. You had 5k in your inventory, put it in the corps, took it back (without the ammo actually duping or multiplying itself), so you put it in, take it out, rinse and repeat until you transfered a total of 130k (as I said without actually having 130k) and this got the accounts banned?
---
While that would be awesome, probably too much work for something like that.  They have so many other things they need to do, especially now that the roadmap is out.
---
Only time I see him is when I'm close to being over the weight limit so I always end up getting weighed down and usually in the middle of a little fight. Now when I hear that congratulations I just immediately get my sledgehammer out and smash him till he's dust.
---
Yes, i'll prestige my character asap, but i also want to try survival mode without worrying about losing my daily caps from vendors for 3 deaths
---
I would be very interested to see which "innocent" player finds 150k+ of *anything* out there in such a short time.
---
The system is good. Hope it keeps catching exploiters.
---
The drops can shite, but I finally got myself a primed enclave plasma sniper that one shots most enemies since I use Adrenal Reaction, which I would recommend if you’re trying to use plasma weapons as they mostly won’t breach the enemy DR otherwise. 
---
Simple:  The Robots don't hate Phoenix.  The Robots hate you when you haven't completed Mayor for a Day.   Thus, the Robots attack you and Phoenix hates the robots.  They are attacking his customers!  Those bastards!  Phoenix has a laser gun with their name on it for anyone that f\*cks with his customers!  Noone f\*cks with Phoenix's customers!  No one!

I typically play by myself seeing as none of my friends play the game. I'm usually open to teaming up and farming events. I play on Xbox. Anyone can add me if they feel like teaming up. Just shoot me a message. EzSqueezeCheese

Did Bethesda suspend you or was it one of the consoles?
---
Look around the subreddits. I bought the neon plans for 1k earlier today. A huge savings. 
---
sad truth.   
---
PS we need chat.
---
I see them a bunch in the mire. Usually around the heart.
---
yeah, patch seems like it's going to be extensive. Down to play, look me up, same username, just add 664
---
Probably the best easter egg FO's had since "you killed kenny".
---
Watoga, whitesprings, uranium fever and the workshop on the edge of the savage divide and cranberry bog. Only place I've been able to farm a legendary behemoth other than a small lake bed. There is also a lvl 60+ sentry bot that spawns up north of whitesprings train station its the railroad icon after you head north for maybe 1minute and if you cut through the cabin area on the way you can occasionally have a legendary or crowned Yao gui spawn in.
---
On another note you should always let the legendary enemies regain their health and search their bodies directly for a better chance of high tier loot. I recorded game play of letting their health regen and not on fo76 &lt;the sub. And alot of people tried this as well and confirmed it. I think the videos are still on my profile but they are from the previous Tse nerf patch as well.
---
Farming silos only grants you a couple crowned enemies and there is also the farming scorched earth enemies by dropping the nuke just out of range of fissure prime or where its barely touching it. The fissures cause alot of high level enemies to spawn as well as the queen but you can kite her away. That's my best advice. Hope these help. 
---
I don't remember that one :(
---
I’ve heard of people trolling with shit like that too.
---
I haven't farmed whitesprings in awhile but I know before I quit I got 2 Tse and one explosive weapon from uranium fever. They were not lvl 50 but it was a nice way to get the legendary affixes I was looking for. 
---
After level 50, leveling up is almost pointless unless you’re respecing since you can’t get any more points. It doesn’t feel rewarding and I wish that fo76 implemented the same system used in fo4 or even foNV. 
---
I have definetly gotten 3* lvl 50 gear from her but at the same time I have gotten lvl 50 no star garbage guns with max mods. 
---
what's the location on the map?
---
This should have been in from the start
---
It was the one that does more damage with consecutive hits too, but hey, it weighed 30 pounds, the limit was still 600, I was young and needed the money.
---
Thanks for the effort for the video, but that doesn't prove anything actually.   
---
This is how it works in 99% of the games, you get yourself in a very big chunk of valuable items in a short amount of time, game tags you as a cheater and  you are banned. Nothing wrong with it.
---
So pretty
---
Lesson learned, everyone. No more picking up the same massive pile of ammo over and over and over again. 
---
Dude, you have issues;) ... I love it, I love it, I love it! Truly awesome:) 
---
anything goes
---
Fallout 1, Hubtown, there was a deputy named Kenny and if you killed him, a message in the text box would state, "You killed Kenny!  You Bastards!".  It was especially great because South park had first aired only a month or two before game launch.  Ahhh.. the things you could accomplish before graphics became the focal selling point in a game.

Npc's still phase through walls and wreck stuff
---
honestly, i'm not even a little surprised.
---
I found a non firebreather helmet at a raider vendor at sunny top railroad
---
I particularly enjoy how closely he gets to me to give me my prize. Its almost like he's hugging me.
---
Also either chooses moments when I'm sneaking up or in the middle of a battle with super mutants.
---
It has in fact been a while since I last seen him.
---
UO was 25 years ago. everquest was 20 years ago. i think this has been settled for 20 years now. people want their dings.
---
You’re awesome.  
---
I want to build near .... anyone. Would very much love to have a neighbour. It gets lonely most of the time. 
---
The vendors I use:   Watoga Railroad, Phoenix in North Watoga, R&amp;G Railroad, Lewisburg, Watoga Resort, Enclave @ Watoga, and Harper's Ferry.   That's all 7 unique vendors.   You can look at the map and decide where you want to place your camp for the biggest fast travel savings bonus. 
---
Nice..is this how u get access to the Enclave vendor?
---
It's right down the hill from the corpse. A red shack next to a couple of silos. There's a power armor station and assorted chems inside. Likely already opened by someone else before you arrived.
---
Sounds like the Minatour Maze from the Myth of Theseus.
---
Hey! Wanted to let you know that I was able to find a fix for this. I’ll be making a main post on here in a few so more can see. 
---
To begin the “Basic Training” portion of the quest you must be wearing a fatigues and an army helmet. There is an optional objective to search the Barracks for Pvt. Archibald’s Uniform Voucher.
---
When I first completed the quest, I didn’t look for the voucher, and wore the “Military Fatigues” and “Army Helmer”, which I already had. They Master Sergeant  npc accepted those, and I was able to start the training, but encountered the bug I mentioned. 
---
Today, I decided to try looking for the optional objective. Using the voucher gives you “Dirty Army Fatigues” and “Dirty Army Helmet”. 
---
I then completed the quest again wearing these items, and it worked! The quest completed. So the issue may be related to the different types of army fatigues 
---
Thank you for this clear and concise summary
---
No, it has nothing to do with the health of the server. She’s currently bugged and if you lead her too far away from Fissure Prime she becomes invincible, it’s a glitch due to her leash 
---
I killed a number of wendigos before I finally found a hat.  I put the hat on and killed a something something mouth full of adjectives word salad wendigo while wearing the suit and the hat...and it didn't count.  I guess all those adjectives confused the game.   I too, put my suit away, after killing my first wendigo that I got credit for.  Then the quest came back like a boomerang I just can't get rid of no matter how hard I throw it.  Damn it.
---
I only have done one queen but they showed up for me 
---
I have yet to find any since 2018
---
All my alts were at WS asap
---
I played solo for quite a while, completed most of the quests and explored most of the map &amp; lore that way. I really enjoyed it. 
---
Recently I’ve made some friends in game and tend to have teammates most of the time now. It keeps the game fresh after finishing most of the content. 
---
It’s really ridiculous it doesn’t count as stealing 
---
"Search" the body, you can check the item there.
---
After so many hours of playing and exploring 95% of areas, pretty sure its not in the game.
---
i guess i got lucky i found my first and only tse 10mm smg at 100 hours played
---
But are you reciting the 4:8:2000 error? Because your title says otherwise 
---
Get bent 
---
3k? 
---
I recommend some anti biotics,and radaway immediately,
---
But no fight her in the same place every time, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. 
---
When a newbie drops it direct on top of the fissure it still glitches out and her health stops dropping 
---
Also wtf would they add a “leash distance” to her, this wasn’t an issue before the last patch, this is something new related to the changes they made, I don’t know if it was intended or not because they won’t say anything but we’ll get a new patch and a new try. 
---
If you want to blame “leash distance” I’m gonna need at least a single reference outside someone just guessing. 
---
A Pipe Revolver with hardened receiver is still my go to at level 57. 3 levels of Concentrated Fire and high Agility helps a lot.
---
Anyone who claimed to find it is a liar
---
I’m not sure asking for something that has existed in the prior Fallout games is asking for the moon and the stars, especially being that it’s running on the same engine. My guess is it is easier to have a true/false flag on if you’ve discovered a map marker than it is to track every player’s historical whereabouts across servers and thus is just an example of something that would’ve taken too much time to perfect and thus was left out. It’d be nice to see the local map make a comeback in a future release for sure. I too relied heavily on it previously. 
---
But I  fight her in the same place almost every time(v9), and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. 
---
&gt;Pvp in this game is the biggest joke ever.
---
sad truth.
---
I mean that’s not a bug. It literally tells you you have to do this. The big big for this mission is the mission not completing after you did all that. The way to fix it is to just complete the trial run and it will complete even if the markers are still showing up 
---
Oh gee, you mean the rules set by a company don't make the world work they way they want? What's next? Are laws going to stop working? We'll be living in anarchy.
---
I too leave 8 marine tactical helmets behind— Hard Bargain 2 yields 25 caps per helmet or 8 helmets for 200 caps. Of course with super duper one you’re need a third fewer materials for the same output
---
Psn steelerwins. I’ll be on tonight 
---
Why does anything need top be done? What if the kid is playing with full knowledge and encouragement of the parents? What "needs doing" then?
---
Add me rn and I’ll add you when I do get home I got people I already play with so you can just join us 
---
This is probably the closest thing we'll get to proper pets that follow you around in the game. I now need a pet Bloatfly in my life. 
---
Fort defiant straight jacket sell for 40 caps, but 1 plastic, 1 glass, and three rubber is hard to beat
---
Psn... k1d__kha05
---
This is confusing, so I’m just gonna clarify for you. 
---
Mods are basically attachments for guns and armor. The mod you wish to use can either be in your stash or on you, it’s irrelevant. A mod will tell you what it’s for, so for example: “Lever Gun Stinging Receiver.” Select the weapon/armor in the workbench, go to the attachment in the menu and select it for a one time use
---
 This is fallout logic not real world logic.  I suppose a smaller magazine would be slightly easier to handle and therefore slightly faster, but um it makes no sense.
---
No dude, getting the voucher is an optional objective. The actual objectives are “Equip Fatigues” and “Equip Army Helmet”. 
---
You can complete the entire quest with regularly military fatigues and an Army Helmet if you already have one, but it won’t allow the quest to end after you complete every exercise. 
---
And it is a bug. It’s an acknowledged bug on the support page, and I’ve spoken to a community manager here who’s said they’re currently working on a fix and aware of it. 
---
When you relog you lose daily progress and it abandons until the next day
---
Dailies are server-specific and have to be retriggered when you relog.
---
This is why in love Fallout....  What other game can your have a swarm of fly's following you spawned from the "useless" gun 🤣
---
Instructions unclear, dick stuck in ceiling fan 
---
But the mission still tells you to do it. Even tho it’s an optional. It’s not that hard to follow the quest line. The fact that your not doing optional is sad.  Just do what the quest tells you to do and you won’t have problems.  
---
The actual bug in that mission is when you get to the trial run and it doesn’t complete. You just gotta keep running through it and it will auto complete once your finish. I had the same problem. Just read what the mission tells you again and it will work. It’s not that hard to read. 
---
Yea. Any game with auto aim built in as a character mechanic shouldn't have pvp. Lmao. Scan the horizon spamming vats till ya lock on something then pull the trigger. I can't believe people enjoy the pvp. Or think it's takes skill to do. 🤷🏻‍♂️ to each their own I reckon. 
---
Only took a few hops for me. Sticking around a little while incase anyone wants to come loot it. On pc, ign jelat.
---
I saw this in game a day or two ago! It was so awesome!!!
---
Uh… enemy levels were always in Fallout. They just never showed you. 
---
They should add a clan system to the game so that you can build villages 
---
“I’ve been looking for you, got something to deliver; your eyes only. Let’s see here... seems you’ve won the Grand Appalachia sweepstakes. That’s it, gotta go.”
---
Nah, I get that, I’m not trying to claim any personal achievements - I was just along with the ride. It’s just... what’re the odds that every randomly joined a nuke I’ve been at has been successful? And I’m not trying to claim it’s my presence, not at all, I’m just trying to understand the discrepancy from your experience. You’re on PC too I take it? 
---
I mean, I’m sort of a meta build? Bloodied HW build, but I don’t even have BE weapons, just a B Gatling gun. 
---
Guy, I’ve described the full bug to Bethesda support and they’ve confirmed it’s a bug. It’s a bug. 
---
The optional objective is there for people who do not already have army fatigues. That’s why the Master Sergeant accepts the regular fatigues, not just the dirty ones. 
---
The “Equip Fatigue” and “Equip Army Helmet” objectives complete when you put on any fatigues or any army helmet. The Master Sergeant then says the same exact approval dialogue lines as if you completed the optional objective. 
---
You can literally complete every single part of the quest, you receive the dialogue telling you to go to Charleston and get your ID, and the quest doesn’t end. It’s a bug. 
---
Why are you arguing with me that this is not a bug right now? It is. 
---
I've taken to shooting him. Annoying little bastard
---
That's already possible, except for the trust part. Just be on the same team, build at their camp, and get paid...
---
I dunno... I had All Rise at 200% with max perks (slugger, incisor, martial artist) when the SQB was on the ground, and used a two-shot prime gatling gun when the SQB was in the air. The other players had explosive weapons for sure. 
---
Replace their remaining health with radiation. Get a high level, automatic, gamma gun. Irradiate the remaining health away. Add overly generous or an irradiating combat knife.
---
This is amazing and also concerning but I love you for it
---
I feel most people play solo 90% of the time. I finally started 76 this week and made it to level 28 solo, and I’m having a great time. I imagine for killing legendary beasts teams would be necessary.
---
Yup, found that spot a while back. If you get to looking around you can find all kinds of things like this. Out in the mire I found a place where the water texture is missing, you can fall right out the side of the water. There are tons of places along the edges of the maps with floating bushes, rocks, trees, bears ect. lol
---
Nah I’m on XB1 I got triggered from your PC master race comment 😂 but it’s probably true, definitely more casuals on console, which is cool, fallout is to be enjoyed. I just wish the SBQ fight was instanced or something cause with a group of homies we can take her down in half the time but a lot of times people show up and seem to not do much. It’s all good tho I’m looking forward to some more end game content at this point.
---
Literally no one gives a shit and the person who owned the workshop will probably never see this post
---
Yep...it is literally the easiest way to make all the duped weapons no longer significant.  Just raise the weapon level so they aren't desired any longer.
---
Did the v9 safe launch, may be the thing.
---
I’m waiting for the day that poison resist becomes valuable. When they open up the vault and it has a mirelurk queen as an end boss, their value will skyrocket.
---
Could you elaborate?  You are using the goo because you have more control of the rads?  So you can stop as soon as mutation is reached?  
---
That's sad
---
Bravo.
---
I betting you were communicating over the xbox text chat, not through the game. That thing has a whole different set of rules.
---
It would stop duping completely
---
For about an hour
---
I totally get it I’m lvl 200 and even if I win 2 out of 3 fights I’m usually still in the red. I’ve got most of the stuff I want at this point anyways so I see those caps as something to play around with but I understand those who want to buy most of the plans and stuff. 
---
Funny joke. 
---
You: Hey you ever smell mother balls? 
---
Friend: yeah? 
---
You: How do you get they're little legs apart? 
---
I was in a xbox live party so I couldn't communicate to the kid otherwise.
---
I, a professional Minecraft Linguist, have found some errors in your comment and have recrafted it. 
---
 &gt;i was in a xChest live party so i couldn't communicate to the kid otherwise.
---
I'm solo 99% of the time.
---
I have the ultracite gatling laser beta wave tuner crafting ability. Is that what you need? Did you already get it?
---
I'll be honest with you, power armor isn't really good for PVP at present because of the lack of legendary armor pieces. I hope Bethesda introduces them. At that point PA should come back to the competitive fore.
---
If you do this, it will be hard to tell what level enemies are. Enemies had levels in fallout 4, but you could only see them with the awareness perk. Level determined what they could drop, and they scaled based on your level. Additionally, gear in this game drops based on the enemies level, so removing levels would needlessly complicate things.
---
Most people with explosive weapons don’t even have the perks for it. Trust me
---
I've been playing Lone Wanderer style since day one of the beta. The closest I get to "teaming up" with other players is when I do one of my free ammo dumps for a low level player, or if I happen to be traveling through an event area for someone defending their claimed workshop (mostly since lower level players attract things you can cook up in those kind of events) half the time I'm gone before the event doles out the rewards but to me its far more satisfying rolling down a hill seeing some greenhorn doing their level best to beat of half a dozen enemies with a golf club dropping down to kick in the optic camouflage pulling out the trusty .50 cal sniper rifle and popping 4 or 5 heads before moving on like I was never there.
---
The suspension is a bit ridiculous and the fact the kid reported you is hilarious, but I think you’re overlooking the core issue here. 
---
You claimed the workshop, he wanted to contest it, so he attacked you. That’s an in game mechanic, and he’s allowed to grief you if he wants to. 
---
You opted to message him and give him shit for doing something that is fully permitted in game. Next time just keep killing him next time and fuck him over. 
---
The problem wasn’t that he’s a kid, the problem is you gave him shit for doing something just because it inconvenienced you. 
---
Xbox did. But because of the suspension I can not play in teams.
---
Not staying for long but I'll give it a couple more minutes.
---
I got it during a workshop event. 
---
You type the code in at the end of your silo run its the launch code 
---
Now that be awesome!! Goodbye game loneliness!
---
Do you happen to remember which Workshop :o
---
From what he said, console, probably Xbox. They are super fast to suspend anyone who curses or using threatening words. But OP has also been reported before, you dont get insta-popped for 1 message. Either way OP should just mute and move on, ESRB is a suggestion, it only really applies to retail. And most games say the online features are unrated because humans are HUGE piles of shit.
---
LoL
---
Is this on xbox?
---
Gotchu 
---
But hasn’t it been proven that slap damage does 5 points of damage no matter what?
---
Also on Xbox. I play solo.  My play time is limited and choatic so can't sync with known players.  Will occasionally join an event group, or a team on a whim.  But it is rare.   
---
On the roof of Camp McClintock
---
Yeah, I had a similar thing happen before with my workshops and then there is the pvp. I had Grafton Steel and all of the extractors set up. None of them were locked, so anybody can take from them if they want. I wasn't really expecting anyone to try and claim it, but some guy showed up and killed me in one shot with an explosive shotgun (big surprise). Then he took my junk and left the server, so he didn't actually want the workshop. He just wanted to one shot and take someone's shit, because it's fun I guess. Too bad my energy weapons are completely useless and I would have never won anyway.
---
Idk,  while it would be cool, every clock in every Fallout has been froze at the time the bombs fell, it's like a tradition at this point lol  
---
TeHScanman   add me 
---
Okay, now this is EPIC 😎👍
---
I just hit level 50 today and completed I Am Become Death -all solo.   I’ve enjoyed it a lot!
---
Atomic shop sales.
---
I play solo when I want to read terminals, listen to holotapes, or otherwise engulf myself in the environment.  Hard to take in the world sometimes when you are on the move with others.
---
But, when it comes to looting and just general kicking ass, a group can be fun.
---
Pretty much solo all the time.   Kind enjoy going around the game exploring at my own pace and not worrying about when I’ll get to some quests.
---
Yes I got it today, thanks for the effort tho.
---
Update: already found like 5 people to play with, be cool to have a revolving kinda group where we can all chill in a party or something and play. Like the idea of a little community. Could be overdoing it though lmk 
---
Sound like it's just a xbox communications ban.  I have heard that xbox is pretty strict when it comes so sending vulgar or explicit messages to other players. 
---
Not to toot my own horn, but I made a somewhat popular post testing my auto pistol build out and estimated the DPS. [I was doing over 2000 DPS with a 53 damage pistol](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/axffrc/psa_damage_per_second_calculations_how_sneak/). You may like it.
---
It revolves around concentrated fire for headshots, and stacking critical and sneak attack bonuses. Low perception needed, stack as much agility and luck as possible.
---
Platform please? I’m on psn. I can make the BoS chest. But I don’t have enough perk to make the dense.
---
I usually hate the "Bethesda we need" posts, but this one I'm 100% on board with
---
The Whitespring Enclave and the Order of Mysteries were both destroyed in 2086. The former coincided with the rise of the Scorchbeasts, which overwhelmed the Appalachian BoS by August 2095. With the Brotherhood's defenses breached, the Scorchbeasts and their plague spread outward from the Bog, quickly taking out any remaining humans whether Responder, Raider, or Free State.
---
Given their relative distance from the fissures, the Responders were probably the last to fall, alongside a mere handful of Free State holdouts that managed to hole back up in their bunkers after the fall of Harper's Ferry.
---
👍
---
I'm referring to the event at the top right corner.
---
Yeah just came across that the other night  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/ZGXIu8l](https://imgur.com/a/ZGXIu8l)
---
It’s more of a stop to prevent anything from healing you to much, including the healing factor mutation. 
---
So I’d use that to bring down my health to the point where bloodied is kicking butt, but you can then still use rad-away and be back to full health.  It’s not actually different then sitting on a radioactive barrel until you hit the level you want, it’s just portable. 
---
To be fair. Abusive Language is a bannable offense. Anyone could report you for it.
---
An atomic shop sale, like he said. 
---
Stupid question, but how do you make new syringer ammo?
---
What was the event called?
---
My CAMP us just up the hill from there!
---
You are my favorite fallout player of all time. 
---
There's only one type of syringer ammo.  You make it at a tinker's bench.  The barrels give it different effects.  You unlock them by scrapping syringers.
---
mendalbaum, mendalbaum!, MENDALBAUM!!
---
Dont ever swear online. If youre on xbox, refrain from insults. Its like Nazi Germany. You can't say shit anymore, so thats on you mate. 
---
Trust me; ive gotten my comms banned 4 or more times. Lost count. The last one I had was about a year ago. Haven't been comms banned since. I got clever with my insults. Learn to do so as well. 
---
Should have reported him for griefing, kept stealing his caps from pvp, or leave. I know you worked hard to take that area, but if it bothers you so much that someone is being obnoxious, you gotta be the bigger person. Look where swearing on xbox live got ya. 
---
Also, if you can't tell any of your friends that your comms are banned, I can let them know for you if you DM me their gtags. Trust me, I know how frustrating *that shit* is. 
---
Yeah noticed that too. Usually get a flood of mr gutsy after the protectrons and finally the assaultron, but the number changes. It maybe after you wipe a silo, cause noticed it's really calm when you don't have to key in the code again. Who knows!
---
I posted this a while back, and I still would love to see fishing added to the game. We already have fishing rods and fishing outfits in game, so why not, Todd?
---
That should explain it then. While I’m not a fan of how OP handled the situation per se, a suspension is pretty overkill, so hopefully access is regained soon. 
---
Been grinding so much out the past few days and started forgetting it wasnt a single player game after lack of running into other players
---
My point is that the mass quantities of duped weapons would no longer have value.  Mass duping like previously does not exist any longer.
---
You are on the right path of enlightment.
---
HITLER's back
---
I've got over 500 hrs in the game...lvl 276 main...I can't explain how it happened
---
It was called these items are only for a limited time. 
---
I understand what you mean and I agree. But dupers are most likely going to still find more ways. It sucks that the economy has been ruined by them
---
All of them can drop it. I have one if you're on pc, 300g. Someone was looking for that a few days back on this sub.
---
Agreed. I also wish you could use crafting stations while in your PA.
---
I'm sensing a lot of butthurt on this post.
---
Yes. I not really a fallout issue more of an xbox live thing. You can still play all your games you just can't send messages or join a party. From what I remember reading  they usually last 1 to 14 days depending on your number of offenses.
---
Yeah, you guys really don't know what I'm talking about.
---
In the main menu, at the top right corner, there is always an event. They come with a cartoon of some sort and a title in a creative font. Then the description of the event is under it, in plain white font.
---
There's no need to be smartass, dude. Learn how to speak to people.
---
Yeah, Ive been communication banned a couple of times for just even saying something by voice that isnt really provable. My friend get comm banned because he was joining a party and kept getting kicked so they reported him and that caused him to get comm banned for about a week.
---
Nuke vs. C.A.M.P.? Nuke wins every time. 
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure there's no way to trigger it again but not 100%. I've had Camden come up twice for 6 tokens on my main.
---
I was trying to get him to stop all he was doing at that point was harassing us. I'm pretty sure he ran out of caps.
---
Thanks a lot for sharing!
---
This should be upvoted! I tested this out in two locations today and in both scorchbeasts and accompanying scorched mobs were spawned when I mined ultracite. Fantastic catch! Recommend adding to the wiki if you can.
---
You asked a question. We all answered. Not sure how that’s being a smart ass. 
---
Phrasing j/k
---
Fair enuff.  Cheers.
---
Yes Floppotron! I didn't know he did this one! Love it!
---
Go to site alpha, bravo, or charlie
---
That was hilarious 
---
Me and my friend duoed a queen 5 hours ago, purposely on an empty server just because of that..Seems like it's better to scale her only to the DDs instead of risking a nuke and resources on leechers
---
That's awesome. You just made my day! I couldn't stop laughing watching the clip. 
---
What platform are you on? I'm pretty sure I've got an extra. 
---
Fascinating and bizarre.
---
Based on my experience in game, and with unarmed build friends, the person that chooses to play unarmed tends to be a very strange and creative person.  The clown suit and Fastnacht mask is almost a uniform, much like goths dressing in black or juggalos with huge pants.  I have two friends that play unarmed builds, and they both have a variety of the creepiest, strangest outfits the game has to offer.  I was actively getting Fuzzy tokens once a day to give to a friend so she could buy the costume.  She had three alts just so she could get more per day.  
---
My "end game" is a hunt for an instigating/explosive lever-action white whale, and hers was a mascot suit.  Here's a picture of her [camp entrance](https://imgur.com/BH6GUf7).  There's a a lot of really interesting people out in Appalachia.
---
Then again, I'm into [planking](https://imgur.com/QhKyQTK), [chopping it up with sloths](https://imgur.com/4w4FX8r) and bringing [TV characters](https://imgur.com/e9dugLc) to my Fallout experience.
---
The thumbs up you give to the guy that turns around to the locked door HAHAHA
---
No problem! If you’re experiencing the same bug, report back if this fix works for you as well when you get a chance.
---
If you test yourself and check your stats, your mutations will have a "suppressed" in its description as well if you don't have marsupial....but honestly I think everyone should have that mutation, its way too fun.
---
The 2 previous people weren't. You were. "It's called _____" is a sarcastic remark. Clearly, that wasn't the actual title, so you replied with that to be sarcastic.
---
You have peaked
---
I love hunter x. Netero still makes me sad. So elite but couldn't get the job done. Poof reminds me of the internet
---
Mate, in the top right corner, with a little cartoon they have an Atomic Shop Sale.  
---
Seriously man we aren't idiots, we're giving you your answer! 
---
Good job
---
Imagine getting bullied by 10 year olds LUL
---
I’m not necessarily arguing. I’m trying to give a workaround in all honesty. 
---
I am. Same username as here. Add me (I'm sure we'll run into each other)
---
Fucking literally atomic shop sales. Why are you so dense
---
&amp; make the stash hold more.
---
Yeah cause you called them a liar. You’re being dense asf. It was literally atomic shop sales. (You guys don’t know what I’m talking about) was your reply. We can scroll down and see what you said
---
The more i'm reading all these answers the more i'm thinking "who the F do these people think they are... ?!".
---
Seriously, who do you think you are with your "expectations", talking about about "what i wanted" or "i didn't need this" and all this crap. 
---
"I don't have time to play a decent game, my time's too precious to waste it for anything else than a masterpiece, i'm an important person, i'm great, anything below amazing is an insult to me !".
---
 When did the video game community become so pathetically entitled, thinking that devellopers work their ass off for them ?
---
WHO ARE YOU ?! What have you done ? Have you ever made a videogame ? Is it your money and your time that have been thrown into the making of these game for the entertainment of thousands of people ?
---
Cut damage in half? You must be joking? That would make bloodied builds useless as you can still get 500 damage with a TSE and the right perks. 
---
We have 20% health and one very major weakness that allows a good player to one shot us, VATS critical. 
---
We can be killed with Gamma Guns too, go get one.
---
The meta is more balanced than ever honestly.
---
I love this trilogy. Please keep on with your sadistic ways.
---
Keep doing what you're doing. This stuff is great!
---
I remember seeing a dude with one at white springs using a turret base on the golf course destroyed it at least 4 times before he messages me saying to stop playing cheap its an odd world
---
Move your camp. It's cheaper to repair that way.
---
Fair enough, you should’ve went and taken his other worship just to fuck with him then lol. My qualm was mainly just the whole no kids should be playing the game thing. Although, i suppose if he’s calling himself a kid, he’s probably far too young to be playing. 
---
Don't really care about that right now. Two assholes decided that because they hate the game, and I happen to play, that they were going to "punish" me because I "paid money to Todd" making me "evil". Seriously. Their own fucking words. I'm livid.

Use the tracking computer in the command room to find yourself a nuclear keycard - use that to gain access to the nuclear silo of your choice and at the end of that lengthy robot punching slog you'll be faced with a device to scan your keycard, a keypad to enter the launch code and a device to pick your location.

They're just greifers. Every game has them. Don't let them upset you or they win. Just drop server at the first sign of trouble next time

Nice, but too much work for me.

3 questions I one sentence....
---
Yes!!!
---
Unfortunately I fucked up and said a choice word in messages, 24 hour comm ban. That part isn't on them, that's on me. I'll own that. I'm just really tired of people like this, and now I'm just gonna take a break from 76 for awhile. Probably will come back at some point, but I need a break.

You can post a picture. You chose the text one apparently. Limit one photo.

ak56thethird itd be nice to not be solo for once 
---
Pm'd.
---
Not sure if it helps but you can get by that section without fixing the reactor if you have 3* hacking and lockpocking.
---
Once you enter the actual reactor turn right and follow the wall to a 3* locked door. Once through the door go into the second room and hack a terminal to end the reactor lockdown. This will open the exit even if the reactor is not fixed. 
---
I have launced on pc withing the last day and had no issue but I didnt fix the reactor so it may be bugged.
---
Thank you
---
He's right. Enemies should not have levels. Instead when prayers damage an enemy the actual damage should be calculated such that a level 1 player and a level 100 player with no perks or bonuses should do equal damage to the enemy.

I used to exclusively play solo, from BETA day one up to mid January.  I wasn't lonely, per se, but it was getting a little dull occupying your time with only what the game offers after completing the quests.  Namely, events and legendary farming.  
---
I was doing Uranium Fever with a couple strangers.  One was using her mic and started scolding and mildly berating the other person for insta-killing the first three star supervisor boss.  I got on my mic and agreed that we'd team up on him if he did it again (he was high level, so he should know better).  I think he could hear us, because he was a lot more generous the next time.  Afterwards, I asked her when she was getting into and we partied up for a good 3 hours.  Between her and several friends she introduced me to, I almost never play solo anymore.
---
I can respect the desire to be a lone wolf, but teaming up makes for a much more enjoyable time at nuke zones, and the various, sometimes strange shenanigans you get up to when no one has much to do.  Extreme home makeovers on a friend's camp while they're afk, turning a workshop into a sleazy brothel and getting a LOT of fire support when a griefer starts attacking your base.  
---
A lot of events are 1000x more fun when you're partied up with others.  I used to never participate in Horde events, despite a guaranteed 3-star boss.  With a friend or two, you can individually fast travel to the various sites and call out for your buddies to fast travel to you when you find the boss.  I got this [3-star gauntlet](https://imgur.com/GXcKxJ1) the other day from a robobrain horde in Cranberry Bog.
---
I'm pretty antisocial in real life, so I'm actually really surprised at how enjoyable it is to play in a team.
---
I've teamed up a few times, but usually end up by myself. I also play AS myself, lol. My PSN username is the same as my reddit, so if you see me on the PS4 servers, you have some idea of what I look like.
---
Where is that found??

&gt;You can watch a video of it here

It's right in flatwoods near the church

I use Ultracite Armor with Calibrated Shocks on both legs. I did get the plans to drop from a SBQ and you will need some violet flux to craft them, but it's there.
---
This.  Is.  Incredible. 
---
The way the person I was replying to said sounded sarcastic, as if there wasn't a title. That's what made me believe that he wasn't referring to what I meant. There's no need to insult me.
---
Your first comment said “That’s not even a bug.” and was generally hostile af. 
---
I heard so many bad things about the game but got it anyway. Always loved fallout and WV is my home so I had to try it. Surprised myself. I love it. Been playing solo all week. On PS4 if anyone wants to get down. Same name as here.
---
It’s in an abandoned house just a little bit north of Camden Park.

I didn't call them a liar. I called them a smartass for giving me a sarcastic answer for the title, which made me believe that they weren't referring to what I meant.

He shows up at the absolute worst times for me. Not that his prizes are too noteworthy or anything. But I was fighting some mole miners and he had got in the mix. I was dancing with a deathclaw chameleon and poof, there he is again. 😂 The thought that counts, right?

This is the good damn best thing I have ever seen in the wasteland! Country roads coming on was really the icing on the cake. Only thing better would be to hear people screaming into their mics in fear just under the music.

I think his name has significance. It's a mythical creature, reborn from it's firey death. I think Pheonix was a damaged Watoga Protectron that the BoS rebuilt and gave a new purpose: logistics. Once removed from the system the Watoga Protectrons saw it as an enemy and attack.
---
No idea why he can't take damage, but then again, neither do the other traders. 
---
It's a bonus to range and accuracy while actively aiming, not while having sights installed on the gun. I was experimenting with the pistol weapons double dipping into perks for pistols and rifles and noticed that there was no increase to weapon stats for range and accuracy when I had the perk cards chosen, but I did receive the relevant bonuses for damage from the rifleman and gunslinger perks. So, the crack shot and long shot perks only reduce bullet spread and the damage reduction over distance while you are personally aiming the gun. They have 0 bearing on VATS accuracy whatsoever.
---
Moth balls* god damn auto correct 🤣

kk
---
I don't want to ruin any quest for you, but if you're looking to get in the Enclave Bunker you should probably take a good hard look at the abandoned waste dump on the eastern edge of the map. 
---
Actually all are no VATS. "Sighted" is when you are looking down the sights, not when you have sights or a scope installed. Otherwise the description wouldn't need to say "sighted" because every pistol and rifle has at least iron sights.
---
\*is a kid and on pc\*

most kids play on console since its the only real cheap thing that can run 76 and most of them dont have a powerful rig to play the game

You are an artist.

if something is going down in your house i doubt the first thing on your mind is turning off your mic. There is something going down in your house!!
---
It's always nice when guests drop by.
---
Ah! A man of culture, I see!
---
You would be correct good sir. I had to test it to make sure, but VATS accuracy is not influenced by the aforementioned perks.
---
VATS is actually more heavily influenced by range than accuracy for some reason. So, if you want the highest VATS accuracy, increase the range of your guns and dump points into perception (which directly influences accuracy in VATS per point). If you want to be able to fire more shots in VATS, go for low weight and reflex sights, quick mags etc. I'm assuming there's a happy medium where you can be 95% accurate and then put the rest of the modifiers into reduced AP cost.
---
We sure did, but don’t worry I’m thinking of doing it again so more people can participate in a community event!
---
I kept thinking when watching the video, man you're such a dick, but I couldn't stop laughing! Well done sir!

If it happens to me, it probably happens to others...

Same boat. My condolences.

No lol and you can get them for free during g the quest and make them whenever
---
Platform?
---
I usually put a low level lock on the stuff I want, but leave everything else for anyone passing through. Fusion Cores get unlocked when I have enough and I put out the cardboard signs pointing to the free Fusion Cores.  At Poseidon have had 6 cardboard signs, starting at the road, leading back to the free cores. But because it is a PVP area I think some people do not want to take a chance, even though they could be getting free stuff, it could be a trap ;-) Plus they could be joining the event to defend the WS for easy rewards.
---
Yeah the double barrel doesn't have this issue because they already have the barrel lengths and ranges set at reasonable numbers. I have a double ammo double barrel and it works well enough with all the barrel lengths.

The server is loading models and textures, it is supposed to stay blank, but instead out shows the loading.

Usually you have control and you move the character, after few seconds the load end and you're teleported back to starting point.

Happened various times on xbox

No I don’t I’m dumb, thank you!

Thank you very kindly!

I don't have any neighbours thankfully.
---
It does about half the time on PS4. I assume it's a bug, but it'll show everything equipped (PA and normal armor).
---
Wow, those are great!
---
Aside from the Scorched Earth event, you don't really need others around to make it through every quest in the game.
---
As a newer player, I'd like to offer you a bit of key advice for later on in your game.  When doing events that have other players around, it's always courteous to get your hit on a legendary enemy, and allow others to get hits, as well.  That way everyone gets loot from it.  If you smash it by yourself, no one else can gather loot from the body.  Utilizing splash/aoe damage (explosives, tesla coil power armor chest mod, etc) will allow you to loot the body if someone else didn't learn that sharing is caring.  Also, use passive mode (a toggle selection in game options while you're on a server) so you don't unintentionally damage others and become wanted while in an event where things are happening quickly.
---
Whether you like it or not, much of the most desirable end game gear is easiest to acquire in nuke zones, where you're always going to have to share space with other players.  This can be a huge advantage if you make friends and squad up to share perk cards and call out that you have a three-star legendary, so everyone in your team can share.  They just might land your white whale of a weapon, or you theirs.
---
The easiest to know is perception, it increases accuracy in VATS per point. After that is range. The farther your weapons range is the higher your percent to hit in VATS is. Accuracy as a stat, from what I can see, is the likelihood of the projectile to go somewhere outside of the center of the aiming reticle. If you've ever shot a pistol at a distance and had the round miss even though you were aimed directly at your target, this is a perfect example. It will still land somewhere within the bloom displayed, but not dead center. So knowing all of this;
---
A) Perception is invaluable to a vats build as far as accuracy goes. Each point directly increases your VATS accuracy.
---
B) Range is the next best way to increase VATS accuracy. For some reason accuracy suffers a penalty if the target is outside of the range, and incurs a bonus if it is inside the range.
---
C) The actual accuracy stat is the likelihood that your round will fly directly where you are aiming. If you fail this roll, then it will land somewhere off center, but still inside of the aiming reticle displayed when in hipfire mode.
---
So, the stats are slightly confusing, and it took some serious trial and error to figure this bbn out myself. Once you know what is going on though, it makes it easier to influence your performance.
---
Fuck kids. "cussing at a kid" can get you suspended wtf ? If they want to play game were you have to take some shots then they should be able to deal with being merely insulted (especially if they deserve it)
---
Thumbs up on tackling that silo alone.  Not an easy task!
---
wow i had one do that in the exact same spot, except without the dying part 
---
The accuracy stat is actually more for manually aiming than VATS. Range is the biggest influence for VATS accuracy. 
---
I've been playing solo since BETA and I've managed to reach Level 105.  I have to admit, I enjoy the social aspect of encountering other vault dwellers, making an the occasional trade, sharing my camp workbenches, or just helping them take out a foe.

You better check the atom shop. It was on the chopping block

That doesn't mean you can't make modifications to a laser pistol or something else should you come across it. It simply means you can't fabricate one from scratch. Find one and you are set, or find the plans and then you are also set.
---
Wander around the Enclave bunker for a while to get an idea of what all went down.
---
&gt;!The Whitespring Enclave's leader, Secretary of Agriculture (and later self-elected "President") Thomas Eckhart, became hell-bent on continued nuclear strikes on China to ensure the total eradication of communism. To that end, he sent his forces to determine how to use the automated missile facilities in Appalachia, and discovered that the system's functions were limited unless it estimated the region was in DEFCON 1.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Because West Virginia was relatively insulated from the Great War, the system was slowly de-escalating the DEFCON level, so Eckhart ordered his Enclave to devise ways to terrorize the region, unleashing the Liberator drones and Super Mutants as well as running biochemical experiments which eventually resulted in discovering the creation of the Scorchbeasts. Eckhart ordered his teams to study and replicate the creatures, to see if they could be exploited for his own purposes. When parts of the Enclave finally realized their "President" would rather burn the world to ash than to allow even one paragraph of *Das Kapital* survive, they revolted. MODUS was damaged in the uprising and released poison gas in retaliation, killing everyone in the bunker.!&lt;
---
(Learn how to speak to people) (you guys don’t know wha to mean) you didn’t say liar but you implied that we didn’t know what we were talking about when you haven’t played the game and we have
---
No, I do.
---
And this is why I never take Workshops. 😋
---
Yeah because after they told you like 3 times you were still trying to say they were wrong. 
---
Because atomic shop sales always happened, so it was conplately reasonable of me to assume you weren't referring to what I was.
---
There are certain outfits - such as the Responder Fire Breathers equipment - that can't be remade after you scrap it.
---
Same with the TV. What's the point of having a television if there's no signals. I'm starting to think that Bethesda forgot to put the antennas on.
---
Yeah seen it the other day. Not sure take a look.
---
No. It wasn’t. Learn how to read. People answered your question and you said they were wrong. Fucking read your post again
---
There’s an endgame besides sbq? I don’t think so. 
---
It will only show 1 star though need to inspect it to see the other stars 
---
\^this is so true.
---
I have both. On ps4.. 
---
I’ve always felt Fallout was a lone wanderer experience, and I’ve played 76 that way as well.
---
Mechanics aside, it’s the only way the narrative thread works (tho’ I’d say Bethesda buggered up and created one of the laziest intros ever).
---
If you’re role playing, 76 isn’t designed for a group experience IMO. If you had just wandered out of the vault, the first thing you’d do is get a settlement together as a group and share resources. You’d have a division of labor that made sense based on skills and needs. The same people would live in the same village (heck, even Ark had persistence among tribe members).
---
Instead, you’re a lonely guy or gal that sometimes runs into other lonely guys or gals, but who you can’t build or live with. Dumb.
---
Now you could do some things narratively to at least improve it: say that people were susceptible to the Scorched virus, so the Overseer instructed them to be cautious and not congregate with others.
---
Or a town of NPC 76’ers, and your character is a scout or scrounger that has to explore the wasteland for a variety of reasons.
---
But as it stands now you really have to stretch for a group, and it seems that the only group experience is “let’s go after bigger baddies”.
---
nuke zones are loads of fun. that's significantly better than playing alone and basically spending your only play time each week posting on forums to try and get to do some kind of end game.
---
Yeah, Xbox doesn’t factor in circumstances. I got TK’d in Siege some years back because I picked this guy’s main and sent the guy, “fucking really?” Two week suspension (I was a naughty kid in my youth and racked up many comms bans for immature trash talk). You have to be super reserved when messaging because people can just play the feelings card and report you even if they’re being twats about a video game.
---
I wish it was circumstantial but I get why it’s not. Infinitely easier, faster, and cheaper to auto review a message for a blacklisted words and swing the hammer.
---
I just explained this in my other reply.
---
Ur explanation is stupid 
---
They answered my question with something that already usually happens, reasonably leading me to believe that they were confused. Why do you have this strange desire to make it seem like I was calling others stupid or liars?
---
OP is on Xbox. It’s an Xbox TOS deal. Gotta keep it PG family rated universally.
---
Who hurt you?
---
according to the lore when the scorched plague goes far enough you eventually petrify into a brittle statue that just crumbles to the touch, but before that you become a scorched. So what's happening is that those scorched are in the process of becoming "statues" but you awaken them before they turn completely into dust.
---
thats cuz they know they can record and report..so they're baiting you...
---
I've been debating on hiring someone to kit out my HQ with advanced power connectors. Hiding the wires would be so nice.
---
Awesome.   Well done
---
If you’re Xbox I can do it.
---
I've been playing quite a bit the past few days.  I did get disconnected during 1 of the 3 SBQ flights I was in but that is the only disconnect I've had since I started playing again.

I have enjoyed playing this game solo more than I ever have when teamed up with someone (whether I know them or not). I play Bethesda games for the exploration and lore, unlocking all boxes and terminals that I can and trying to suss out all the secrets of any given location.  Whenever I join up with someone I inevitably miss out on all that, either because they want to zoom through, or because I feel guilty for making them wait while I explore and unlock. Heck I feel stressed out when someone is in the same vicinity as me because I don't want them to remove any items that are laying about on surfaces, so I inevitably rush through or leave a location if someone else is there, to avoid any potential of me not seeing it in it's intended state.  If you are a old-time Fallout fan (I've been playing since the first game came out, pre-Bethesda), I would strongly recommend playing this game solo so you can enjoy all the locations and lore by yourself, without being rushed. Only when I've completely explored the entire map do I intend to do any quests that require teamwork like the SBQ.
---
Agreed.  I started using an X-01 suit for nukes with my sniper, and equipped the helmet with VATS matrix and the chest with a Core Assembly.  I'm starting to spec more for swapping in VATS related perks during nukes, and those two mods help tremendously when put together.  Have 70%+ accuracy on the flying queen at all times and an AP pool that regenerates incredibly quickly with a furious/vats crit handmade rifle is a big boost in effectiveness.  The power armor isn't great for stealth, but it's very difficult to remain hidden for long when there's dozens of strong enemies everywhere, and the hazmat suit is useless anyways.  I can stay alive much, much longer with full armor and put out significantly more damage.
---
The hardest part is remembering to put Starched Genes back on after the fight is over!  I wiped half my mutations once, and put all my radaway in my stash so I have to travel back to a stash box to clean up, which is enough of a reminder to put starched genes back on when I equip travel agent.
---
Dude, where do I get that mask?
---
4 had that quest, was it Diamond City Blues? That had a fair few end results that varied on how you went about it, one of the best quests in the game imo. The ending to the MQ was pretty half baked though. 
---
They don't have twice the effect though. It's way more than that because they compound the range reduction on the shorter barrels. If you apply a suppressor to a long barrel you go from 72 range to 42 for a \~42% reduction of range. If you apply a suppressor to a short barrel you go from 36 range to 6 (yes, six) range for an \~85% reduction. You're already losing range by going to a shorter barrel (range reduction is normally 33% long to medium and then 50% long to short) so why are they double nerfing the range by making the range reduction muliply like that? It has zero benefit to weapon balance to have it like this. There is no advantage to using a short barrel over a long barrel other than aesthetics (and maybe a pound of weapon weight which makes very little difference).
---
It's cruel but if used right to get the grifers away this could prove to be a good use to root them all out. 
---
Plus I can see this being a great way for you getting more caps: A charge fee then lure them like fish towards ol' Deathclaw! You'll be ritch :D
---
that was a great drop
---
On Fallout 4, if you took a perk (perception 1 I believe) you could see the enemy level by targeting them with VATS. So even before fo76, we could see the levels.

I *mostly* play it by myself and enjoy the unpredictability that other players bring.
---
I play solo, primarily because I'm one of 2 PC players of all my real-life friends. The other friend plays Anthem. 
---
I did the math, and of all my hours, I've played solo 99.2% of the time. This is not to say I'm not 'community oriented,' as I will quietly assist people in need. I also appreciate the help other players give me. It doesn't mean we have to get all formal about it. It's just a doughnut, I don't need a receipt.
---
The primary reason I don't 'team up' is because FO76 is 'me time.' I manage a group of crazy young people and rattle on all day. They wear me the hell out (I'm old). When I get home I just want to drink my beer and chill. Appalachia is perfect for this.

I and a person that is a psychologist in real life worked with Blizzard pre-activision to have the police do a well check on a college student that was acting suicidal. We kept him talking in a group chat while we worked to get him checked on. He had taken enough pills that he would have died. A few weeks later he logged in and thanked us for helping him. I never saw him again. What is sad is there were people actually encouraging this kid to kill himself.

there are no robots in the vaults :| may or may not have glitched into then in October last year.
---
Hence one reason the character in Tomb Raider was originally male, but was changed to Lara Croft. I tend to play Elder Scrolls games as a female character, but thought the multiplayer and voice aspects of 76 would make that awkward for me.

Yes, it is speculation. Unless some devs are secretly posting on here with fake accounts, then none of us here know what went on during development. But I'm speculating based on my experience as an avid gamer, game journalist, obsessive follower of the industry, and business school grad.   
---
Anyway, Bethesda did say that about micro-transactions, and that's where the game is now, **to their credit**. Though that doesn't mean that they always intended it to be that way. What we have may be the remnants of an old plan that had to be gutted fast.  
---
Perk cards have a number of elements to them that suggest monetization was the initial plan. There's also a BIG reason why they NEEDED to sell Perk Packs.   
---
1) randomness: From a design perspective, randomizing the perk cards doesn't make much sense in the given system. Players have no way to earn packs aside from leveling. With the contents of packs being randomized it increases the chance of a player not gaining an desired perk card that might be critical to a build. A better system for this style of reward/growth would be to give a player access to ALL the cards they can use with their current SPECIAL build. That would put agency in the players' hands and not in an RNG.   
---
However, randomness does make sense if the perk packs were meant to be sold via microtransactions or as rewards in loot boxes. Then a player is encouraged to buy as many packs as needed to get the perk cards they want for a particular build. It wouldn't be to different from a player buying card packs in Hearthstone to build a desired deck.   
---
2) design: Perk packs LOOK very much like collectible card packs. They're presented almost like you cracked open a Magic booster pack or an old trading card pack, right down to the crappy gum included. Every single design element of a game is planned out. The Perk Packs are a new concept and were not based on previous Fallout elements, so their design was meant to look and feel like a collectible card pack. But why do that if players cannot actually COLLECT card packs?   
---
3) Keeping the lights on: Running servers and post-launch developers costs money. Lots of money. And Bethesda didn't plan to put all of the profits from Fallout 76 into a bank account labeled "to keep Fallout 76 running". They had plans for that revenue. Fallout 76 was designed to be a live service style game. That means they have to sell additional products beyond the game itself in order to keep it going. The Atom Store is a good example of this, but it doesn't really compel players to spend money. From a business perspective, it's not a good revenue stream. Live service games make their money by offering you multiple microtransaction options. One way they could have done this would be to implement loot boxes (lunchboxes) and to sell Perk Packs.   
---
Now I'll speculate further here because while the Perk Packs do LOOK a lot like they were designed to be bought for real $$$ and they've found traces of what looks a bit like a loot box system in the code, neither of those things exist in the game AS IT IS NOW (thank god). But why is that? Why would they implement this and pull back? I have 2 theories.
---
1) Bethesda Austin screwed up. Maybe the dev studio Beth Austin planned for this and were implementing it when someone at corporate saw how much players were pushing back against loot boxes, and they made Beth Austin cut the content out in order to prevent PR backlash from the fans. But it was tied into the leveling mechanic so they couldn't kill Perk Packs entirely.   
---
2) Bethesda saw what happened to EA. So, if you haven't been paying attention, EA done shit the bed so HARD that everyone in the industry felt it. StarWars Battlefront 2 was such a shitshow that GOVERNMENTS are stepping in to deal with the gaming industry. [https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-09-17-15-european-gambling-regulators-unite-to-tackle-loot-box-threat](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-09-17-15-european-gambling-regulators-unite-to-tackle-loot-box-threat)  
---
That's bad and every game studio that deals in microtransactions have to be worrying about the future right now.   
---
The whole EA mess hit the fan 1 year before Fallout 76 launched. That's enough time for the folks at Bethesda to see what happened to EA and where Loot Boxes were about to be investigated, and cut them from a game in development but only 1 year out from launch. But that's also a short enough period for them to not have enough time, money, or manpower to completely redesign the leveling perk system to remove all traces entirely. 
---
That’s fair
---
what is the name of the quest where you get that ? Im sure I only got the plans for an ultracite armor from that last Brotherhood of steel quest ... its the one where you search for taggerdy in the glassed mine right ?
---
I’ve complete Mayor for a Day. They don’t attack me. They attack Phoenix. 
---
I came across a group that hated adults. Said that adults ruin games, because they only play with their own kids instead of random children.
---
Not sure. I do know that China bans movies about time travel. Not sure if that applies to games too. But I bet the gov censors it or puts a big Commie notice that says "the sayings about of government style are based on baseless bias and inaccuracies"

You likely unlocked the paint scheme for the combat helmet. That took me for a loop for a very long time before I understood what happened.
---
So to be clear, you like it that people were unhappy about the game, because now you run into more people who suit you're very specific criteria of "acceptable" to play with.

After each patch, I light the quest back up as active and make the long trudge to that waterfall deep within Wendigo Cave.  Every time, Bethesda developers disappoint.  It's just not important enough for them to fix. I'd like to just clear it out from my Pipboy for good and that's all that keeps me coming back for repeats. If they eliminated the entire quest in a future patch, it wouldn't grieve me. It was an amusing thought by whoever came up with the original idea, but it was so poorly implemented.

They are not that useful but I like to collect things.

A full zealot's piece at the queen fight is OP af, but everyone has always hated zealot armor. Pretty sure it'll be as valued as that

Ultimate challenge. Kill the Scorchbeast Queen with BB guns.

:(.  Sadly I’m on PC.

Id say make other builds more viable. Like heavy gunners and snipers should be as relevant as melee.

I made a bunch of new friends just meeting people playing the game.
---
Still fucked up.

Bethesda clearly intended to have raider players, among other factions. I think the implementation of bounties, workshops, factions, and pacifist mode could be greatly improved.  However people often confuse griefing with using intended pvp mechanics.  I mean some creature is already trying to destroy my base everytime I spawn.  The difference is I get caps when I kill a player attacking my base. 
---
It gonna lie. I’m 13 and I play this game but I have more respect and understand swearing in a adult game. Little kids just use their age to their advantage 
---
I see all sorts of things and think what they scrap into. 
---
I could be wrong, but I remember hearing that Rad-x stacks with Rad Shield. You can also add lead lining to your armor. BoS mod *says* it adds rad resist, but the numbers don't show it. There is a perk in END that adds passive rad resist. And there is always a hazmat suit... 
---
Already there! 
---
As much as I hate to admit it, I also feel like I'm just phasing out of interest in gaming in general. 😔... I'm just not excited for it anymore. IDK, I haven't touched my consoles in months. The only game I was excited for lately was Sekiro (I've always been a big FromSoft fan) but even that excited has all but gone. We'll see what happens. 🙃

I'll come in again.

Nice work.
---
Yeah my 8 year old bugs me constantly to play online M rated games because his friends from school do. I told him it's a firm NO till he's 13. I used some mods to remove most of the mature content from Fallout 4 and he's allowed to play that which has mostly kept him quiet about not being allowed to play 76.
---
exactly, no idea why this is being downvoted. it doesn't matter if it's kid or not, if it's reportable behavior it is fair to be reported.
---
They have the limit for a reason, lag, having seperate stashes would make the whole point of stashes useless
---

---
exactly! when it's directed at people it is toxic, child or not.
---
I agree with the original post.  You shouldn't have to figure out what specific picture Bethesda wants.  If you are in the requested area and snap a picture you should get credit.    
---
You’re the reason I kill people, anyone who carries 700 pounds of junk is a goldmine

I feel like that's supposed to be the fraction system they were talking about
---
Yea, I knew better...got lazy

I almost exclusively play alone snce my play times don't usually line up with people i know.  I don't mind it but I do enjoy the occasional friendly meet up.  I'm pretty used to it though in gaming in general.
---
Technically a 4 star is possible with a machete because the sacrificial blade mod, but yeah it's most likely that 4/5 stars will be content for the vault raids I'm guessing 
---
I tried a while back also. You can link images but not post them directly.
---
Unless it has changed recently of course. 
---
Well, not like you can fit it in your stash .. 700 lbs is a lot
---
Oh this was so sweet.  How cool would it be if there was a pre-war bunker that had machines that played a song.

Like I said previously, you can get it from mods. But why only that?

Yep! Wood piles, soup cans, fans, bobby pins, clipboards...I see them all very differently now.

I've usually left them open.

When you go to the store and say,  "I can scrap that. I need that to build _______.  Oooh, plastic."
---
Xbox doesn't care who you say it to or what game it is. If someone doesn't like that fact you said a curse word they can report you and you will get a communication suspension. Even if what you say is not directed to them like you say something in a game is bs they can still report it and you will most likely get a suspension. If someone doesn't like you they will find a way to report you which is why I say don't talk to other people.
---
If ur duping yes if not go for it
---
Thanks for the info. We'll give that a try next time.

I have one. GT is same. Be on shortly.

Powerful to run 76? You could run this on probably a5-6xx series gtx, which even your integrated gpus are capable of performing at these days

OMG. THIS is awesome.

How many and what are you paying?
---
Nah you’re lying man, they won’t and have never banned for party chat

I don't dupe, I spend lots of time hours farming and crafting soups and such, I just heard of people mass crafting and getting banned I wasn't sure what the limit was or if I could for food.. thank you for the reply :)

Sorry bub, but you should keep junk in the trunk....

Chinogrande32 here. Can't have too many friends in Appalachia.

That would prolly make everyone retire power armor and only heavy gunners would use it. Lol. I thought that was the point of armor or power armor. Sacrifice something to gain something. 
---
You sacrifice rad resist, and (depending on armor and perks) a little bit of ballistic and energy resist to gain better mobility and the amazing perks that come with armor. 
---
I sacrifice mobility and the awesome perks that come on armor to have high resists and use my heavy guns. I also have to worry about fusion cores and repairing said power armor. Plus the mods for power armor are somewhat lack luster compared to armor. 
---
Reckon I just don't see where armor needs any sort of buff. It's op as it is. 
---
You can always scrap it
---
They ban people for making hundreds of thousands of items.
---
I wonder this too

Really smart idea!! You win on this one haha but the bathrobe is my signature lulz

Frikkin' hilarious, if a little bit evil.

Damn it! There are more pics! I need to figure out how to create an album.

All you have to do is make a new account and put it in the party with you, sign into on your Gane with your original profile then switch in game to the second one and voila. Or just keep a second controller on signed in to the new name and put your headset on that

If you are still playing fallout 76

Oh I only make a couple hundred so I'm safe😅 Thank you! :)

It's a play on bisabuelos which means great grandparents. No once seems to get that
---
Your fine with as mutch as you can craft, trade. People were only temp banned for having obvious duped stacks of things it would be impossible to achieve ingame like 10k nuka colas, or 400k ultracite ammo. It would be easy to make and buy that mutch regular ammo but unlikely to get that mutch stable flux for ultracite.
---
They focus on duping of weapons and armor more than other items. I had over 1 thousand screws and hundreds of other junk and they didn't touch them. 
---
I should have.

I always wonder this about the Chinese gov censors: Do they know what satire is?

Holy shit that door that opens to nothing 😂😂😂

OP got suspended for breaking the TOS of his online service.  This is OPs fault, not the kids or parents.

All my friends got banned or fed up. So did solo for a bit.
---
The police uniform also counts.  I know of two different spots where you can get this outfit reliably.  Monongah has one in the police station, and there's another in Harper's Ferry.  From the chem station, turn 180 from where you'd walk to trade with Wallace.  There's a smashed up brick building to your left.  Upstairs (watch out for the grenade bouquet trap at the bottom of the stairs) there's two small rooms.  The room on the left has a vault dweller and civilian sitting opposite each other, and the smaller room on the right has a police uniform on the bed.
---
You get banned
---
Oh jeez. Typo corrected 😂
---
Sure, but all of the weapons people are suggesting in this thread I'd rather be their own weapons instead. For reskins I'd rather them be stylized versions of their base weapons.
---
Like the Handmade Rifle could get a Chinese Assault Rifle reskin, since they're both modeled after the same real world gun. Or they could do something hella stylized, like a remodeled Minigun that matches the datamined Black Rider power armor skin. But turning something like the Hunting Rifle into a Mosin Nagant seems off.
---
This might be what Drake_knight is referring to, but if you go to the federal disposal site workshop, there's a billboard across the street to the south. I've seen them spawn there and fight super mutants or scorched.

It was the Camden Park Jumpsuit. It's already gone. OP is presumably referring to the "Clean" version of the red and white striped Amusement Park Worker uniform

What idiot downvoted me? Whats wrong with my reply?

I like the look of it. But it's definitely more of an LMG.

You can be in party chat with a new account without an xbox live membership? I might do this next time, thanks.

This is the one of the best possible advertisements for Fallout 76's social features. What a hilarious triumph. 
---
I would prefer to play on a team but only for perks and stats. They can do their thing and I can do mine. 
---
You can craft the higher level versions, but they require the lower level versions as one of the ingredients. If you've lost them you're out of luck.
---
It does for me
---
What seems off about it? They're both bolt action rifles. The reload animation would be off for the Mosin but I could live with it. What's the difference between that and a handmade rifle/Chinese assault rifle reskin? Love the stylized skins idea also!

I’ve heard of people using the paddle ball this would be a more fun version of that!!!

I have no friends who play so that sucks. It REALLY sucks since I want to play a support build by loading everyone up with chems.

It sucks you got banned, but there are terms of service you agreed to abide by.

Are u on ps4? I have 3 marine and 1 robot for sale 400 each
---
Solo. I have 3 characters, solo pve (my main), solo pvp (currently leveling up) and a social one. The social one I'm only now playing with because I've been able to get friends on again. I originally started out playing with them but life got in the way. Alone I got to play my way, to immerse myself and move cautiously. I've seen so many other players just rush through a game, like there's some award or accolades if they reach the end first or discover secrets before anyone else. My main hasn't even visited a nuke site yet (but it's in a bad way, horribly encumbered and I figure in there I would burn through cores too quickly)
---
I am glad I got to experience the game at my own pace. Now that I have a friend that can play regularly, I can go at their pace, watch their back as they read entries and not hold them back reading mine.

Why are you surprised dude

Yep ps4. No need for marine but robot yes. I buy this one. Psn please. And can you please tell me which vendor sell the robot mod, I need 3 dense robot mod
---
It's just that piece, it's not anything specific to armor type. I have raider pieces with 25 RR listed as an effect that don't acutally increase RR and others that have it listed and do. 
---
Likewise, +1 endurance doesn't actually increase your HP like it should and is broken. 
---
You cheated the game. Piss off
---
Bethesda didn't ban him, xbox did which he signed a terms and service of not doing exactly what OP did
---
Dang so it’s the games fault :/

Psn is ztoned, not on for about 1h   . It was either harpers or one of the watoga vendors
---
Good to know and I appreciate the feedback but the point still stands.
---
I've yet to be in a party. Encounters with other players has been friendly thus far however. Usually ends up being an exchange of emotes and we go on about our day.
---
Oh don't worry about the reasoning. Those mf's have banned someone who's farmed that legitimately too. One of theyr biggest fans so to say, even made a farming guide and all.
---
buggy game has bugs
---
I added you tell me when online thx
---
That's how I farm whitesprings. If you pick everything up off what you kill it keeps the server stable. Empty meat piles disappear that way. The only problem is you can only do it until you're overencumbered by so much, so you just go to artisan's corner, scrap your junk, and drop all the legendaries you don't want so others can take them.
---
I got it from the BOS vendor in watoga
---
Hmm I see. Good to know it’s a feature, not a bug. 
---
PlayStation is the same. Any swear words in messages you can report and they'll get a warning.
---
Was that before they changed the vendor item lists? I check the vendors everyday and never see a Locker that I don't know already
---
I never get to encounter one of your murder houses :(
---
Are you console or PC?
---
I got it after they changed it, try there or watoga, it helps if you already have the grey lockers unlocked so you know if youve found it
---
Oh don't worry about the immersion. It's recieved a massive nerf to XP and Caps since its release so it's more or less impossible to rush it now or even to quicktravel all over the place without farming some supermutants first.
---
If you want tips then it's gotte be:
---
Don't use onehandet melee. Theyr dps is known to be lower but they suck for stealth too and if you want to set yourself a permanent base somewhere, do it somewhere near supermutants. You can fasttravel to your camp for free and have them avaiable for quick caps then.
---
Exactly what I came here to say. On PS4 about half the time it shows my equipped armor underneath. Can’t figure out what triggers it or if it is just a bug.
---
We have a guy in the trade discord who has crafted over 100000 of both 5.56 and shells. He wanted to disprove the "crafting gets you banned" rumor, so has spent all of his time crafting. He's still currently playing
---
Doesn't matter, it's part of the game. There's really no reason to talk to people you are hostile with unless you want to invite shit.
---
I don't think it's guaranteed. I just popped into a world where there's a toy alien on a pillow instead of this mask on a pillow.
---
Yeah it blows when there isnt enough. I jumped in to threedifferent ones today, but one was seversl lower levels and the other was only 3 or 4 people.  5k rounds down the drain!
---
Works on just about anything 🤣🤨
---
They don't ban for crafting, I craft hundreds of thousands in ammo a month with no issue. The people complaining about getting banned for crafting were dupers, they did this to try and trash the game and stir shit cos they got banned. 
---
You don't get banned for crafting huge amounts, your account might get flagged and then they will look into how you attained the large amount, it's pretty simple, if your account shows you sitting at a craft bench for an hour and then having 100k of whatever, it's different to your account showing you crafting 1k of whatever and then doubling every time you log in.
---
Aye man you’re cool trashing a game on its own subreddit. Save some women for the rest of us.
---
Play with friends? what_meme.jpeg
---
Not all of them. One of theyr most infamous banns was someone who's legit farmed his stuff and still got banned because he got over the limit.
---
It should be fine if you're actually living your life though.
---
Glad I don't play on consoles anymore. It's fucking stupid how they would ban people for cursing on a rated M game, let alone a multiplayer game in general. This one's for you OP. Bitch tit cunt shit cock. Piss, piss out my ass.
---
Laughed till I cried! Thank you!!!
---
P.S If interested my username on ps4 is obsessed1993 
---
Yeah I'm on PS4 and it never shows what's equipped underneath which makes selling or scrapping when wearing power armor a real drag.

I'd like to buy some if you have them for sale...

I gave one to my wife on our wedding anniversary.

Yeah, no.

Lol, that guy that made the guide admitted to thousands of ultracite, theres no way you farm that legitimately lol

So what you're saying is you're The Mechanist's arch nemesis?

Any idea where to find a sloth?!

I had one encounter with Mr. Prize-bot where he gave me a fat stack of 100 Pre-War Money(s) while I was fighting a Scorchbeast, making me over encumbered mid fight.
---
note to self if you see this in flatwoods DO NOT ENTER and kill player
---
I mean pretty much yeah. It weeded out the bitchy people, no? Like constant haters, etc. And specific criteria? I don't think mine was specific, it's just that people are a lot more helpful, communicating and acknowledging.
---
He literally did, no duping involved. You sure gotta waste all your free time to get there (he evidently did, it's reflected on his played time) but so he did and he's got banned for that.
---
That's what happens when a dev is eather to incompetent to fix its bugs or to make some actuall analysis before banning people.. most other devs only bann by clear evidence including third party protection for a reason.
---
Ahh didn't notice that, thanks for the correction. I just saw I could craft it and did.
---
Hi there! I’m not from Sony or Bethesda but I can tell you hat CE43878 is a generic game crash error, it happens when too much happens or when the system can’t keep up, it’s normal for Bethesda games and quite a few others.
---
How did you get here?
---
Ahh didn't see that, thanks for the correction. I just saw I could craft it and hit it right away
---
Still some of the best of theyr kind midgame (cause most other 1handet weapons suck in that level range but fact stands none the less). Definitly not 6.000 caps good but good at least 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
At this rate I seriously feel OP deserves an in game mention. A little note to read or a terminal entry about a wasteland madman. They're becoming a mythical beast of their own.

This is hands down the most enjoyable video I've watched in a looong time. Please have this running 24/7 and keep making new videos lol.

This is just down the hill from my camp. :)

Is it just me or half the time when I jump out then back into my power armor does it show both regular and power armor equipped?

I always assumed it was a bug but it happens a lot

What TOS did he break?

Makes perfect sense. Xbox is lame anyway. 😂

Yeah, let's act like people have been like that for no reason at all.

One of my favorite experiences was this guy who mad a thunder dome.

Any form of duping is cheating.  You did the bad thing.  They banned you for the bad thing.

Will team up next I'm on

Some things to note about mod unlocking:
---
1. Most mods are only learnable via scrapping. The chances are all the same, so you can get mods out of order. Some mods are available via plans but even those are unlockable via scrapping, though at a very very very low chance.
---
2. Any mods unlocked for all weight classes of an armor. So if you unlock a mod, it unlocks for the light, sturdy, and heavy variations.
---
3. When scrapping, you can unlock anything in your armor family no matter which piece you're scrapping. EG: you can scrap an arm and learn a leg mod
---
4. For armor families that has helmets (metal and combat), you also unlock paint jobs for that too. EG: you scrap combat armor and it says you learned "brotherhood of steel", it's very likely you learned the BOS paint scheme for the helmet.
---
Conclusion: if you want to learn combat armor mods. Make a bunch of light combat armor arms and go to town. Also don't forget super duper and armorer perks which makes crafting armor cheaper!
---
It was probably just full of spoiled meat and veggies anyway. And maybe a mini nuke.

I got it defending a workshop. Not sure which one.

So  you're talking about pacifying, not taming. For both, you need the animal friend perk, but to tame, you must find a randomly spawned creature. What does that mean? Not a creature tied to spawning at a location, but a creature spawned from a random event on the map. These are much more rare.
---
It also must be alone, not in a group. 
---
Once you find one, you also need to be twice the creature's level to tame it.
---
I've only found two, a snally and a rad toad. The snally died on it's way back to my camp, the rad toad jumped off a cliff to it's death at my camp, so be careful with them. They don't respawn.
---
For the RP question: RP in the sense that there's more costumes, weapon, and perk combinations than any other Fallout game, yes. There also isn't a backstory forced on you. Before you entered the vault, you could have been anything. No bereaved parent, no frustrated child. Not even a courier.

Though there is currently no interaction in the story or with NPCs, so other than playing dress up and what you decide to do with other players, there are no role-playing opportunities. There is the Wastelanders content update that seems promising with "choices and consequences that will impact the wasteland." This implies roleplaying opportunities to, with choices.
---
But I personally play as a cannibal clown with a Croquette mallet at the moment, but I've been a Vault Tec security cop with a shotgun hunting down bounties, a crashed BoS pilot who salvaged his vertibird minigun, and I've even played a greaser junkie with a switchblade and a drug problem. And this is all the same character
---
You don’t need plans you just need the home defense perk card. 
---
Yeah I wish all unique items became craftable but non-transferable when you got them. Even make it hard to craft at higher levels if you want to make that a balance choice. Just so you could free up inventory slots and not get semi-penalized for completing some quests early. (that level 10 somerset special is taunting me)
---
What about roleplay interaction? can I be a shopkeeper or a quest giver? Like wouldnt it be cool if I wanted a specific resource and give a person a quest to get it for me.
---
My problem with your entire argument is that you're speculating on their design process to shit on them as devs because you don't like the way the perk cards are designed. You can make points all you want, it doesn't change the fact your evidence is entirely circumstantial.  
---
"Randomness" Can be found in a ton of other games and mechanics that don't involve real money or loot boxes. Packs being a random assortment of cards doesn't prove they were intended for micro-transactions. RNG isn't always for loot boxes, sometimes its added to give variety to game play.   
---
"Design" They look like loot boxes? SMH they look like card packs, it fits the motif of cards. A simpler explanation is they look the way they do because you get trading cards IRL out of packs, so in that context it just makes sense you would give them out in randomized packs.    
---
If you watched the Noclip documentary, you'd know that they've always planned to use only cosmetics to pay for the game. If you're trying to say they changed their minds at some point, while it is possible, there just isn't any evidence aside from "They look like loot-boxes" to support that they were.   
---
&gt; Yes, it is speculation. 
---
No, its a conspiracy theory, and its just unhealthy.  You're trying to force a narrative of Bethesda wanting to make a main game mechanic be locked behind a pay wall, with the evidence that's circumstantial at best, made up at worst.
---
I've found if you move the camp it saves your old camp, and you can generally fit it back exactly where it was
---
Mute the offender
---
If your strength is past a certain level, power armor stops giving you boosts, IIRC.
---
You can build camps this close to towns now??
---
There's no such thing. Every day is October 23
---
The game could use more trapped locations, imagine thinking you were smart for using Light Footed only to run into a Deathclaw inside a building.
---
There’s nothing stopping you.

I can't tell by "along with appearance" whether you mean that you wish for both of these, or that you wish you could change your name while changing appearance.
---
In case you don't know--
---
Take off your PA if you're wearing it, go to the map, hit Z (on PC, not sure on console) select "Change appearance" and Bob's your uncle.
---
Of course you may already know this, in which case please ignore me.

You mean the one on the roof? That's tied to a main quest.

It was a pleasure meeting you.  Hopefully in the future we can do...business.

Same on PC, the beth.net ID shows up, not character name.

Curious enough, I have three Blades of Bastet, and two max. level All Rises. Found the extras at vendors. PS4, if anyone is interested throw me a line.

Haha! You evil genius you! I especially like the "light vibe" in this. Much like a festival. Murder church and Player oven came with a much darker vibe - Not that it should be any different, they were awesome, but it's refreshing and cool to see you're innovative in a lot of ways.

Thanks for sharing, I, among many, are certainly looking forward to your next ingenuity! &lt;3

*My friends and I
---
There's a video on YouTube that has a great route for getting a bunch of acid with very little killing involved
---
I play with like 20 other people we all hunt legendaries 3 star, how it works is we all follow one player to the server, friended, and it's the weirdest gameplay that is fun, maybe ever in the history of multiplayer. We try to kill each one slowly so it mutates hopefully repeatedly, giving us all higher chance for rarer loot. Our goal is to deal the least damage and basically tank it as gradually as possible. If someone accidentally kills it too fast they are sorry. 
---
So why do we want the better loot? I have no idea, as our endgame is leisurely relaxed sparring with rare spawns. 
---
You neeeed to record their voices too. That will make these vids 100000 times better
---
Why not craftable public containers? People could grab what you want to give away or donate for a service you provide. You could lock your camp and have a little bit of extra space and hope raiders dont knock down a wall  and loot you.
---
Wow, you completely missed the point. Dumbass. 
---
That screwed system doesn't actually account for things you had though. You don't need to get anything in a short time, you could just collect lots of things for a long time, craft it into something usefull to safe space for stuff you use and still get banned.
---
That shit' just a lazy excuse for theyr lack of fixes.

Tips:
---
* Run Fertile Soil every time it pops up. It only takes like 5 minutes, you get a nice assortment of junk/chems, a decent chance of getting a level 5-10 legendary weapon or armor piece, and a couple hundred easy XP.
---
* Run Powering up Poseidon every time you see it. Between killing level 1-6 scorched and completing the event you'll probably earn 1000+ XP in 20-30 minutes. Plus, you'll learn ever single mod for the hunting rifle, 10mm, and pipe weapons from scrapping all the weapons from the scorched.
---
* After you complete the powering up event, capture the workshop. [[Continued...]](https://www.resavr.com/comment/tips-for-levelling-for-12219231)

Grabbing a smoke and then i'll be with you 👍
---
I posted a similar thread a couple months ago. 100% behind this!
---
Ok
---
&gt; Some people keep claiming that this is not a bug but a game mechanic where enemy prefixes like "Scorched" or "Diseased" overwrite the legendary modifier but this is simply not true.
---
I'm not saying that the premise of your post is wrong but some legendary enemies definitely *do* show up as only Diseased when they are legendary.
---
I have definitely seen some non-legendary, non-diseased enemies with regenerating health (mostly the robots fighting ghouls/mutants/scorched in Watoga), so your post is spot on in that regard and my experience makes sense with your research, but if you notice this happening on a Diseased enemy, it *could* be the Diseased display overriding Legendary.
---
Wait, I thought the claim was the game didn't track where you got it from and that he just kept dropping and picking it up? (while ignoring the fact even quests/challenges don't track things like that. I tried)
---
So now it is he gathered 300K ultricite ammo legitly? Though that still makes it his word against bethesda's. blah blah blah believe a corporation over a player. I have no more a reason to believe the player over bethesda or bethesda over the player so why not believe the one that gave actual information? (hint: it wasnt the player)
---
When I've made enough caps - and enough enemies I'll be sure to perform the  Black Sacrament and summon the Death God himself. 
---
I farm it along with springs at Mountain Side Bed and Breakfast. You can get around 12 acid and 14 springs per server hop you just have to kill the 2 Yao Guai that static spawn every time. 
---
Bad bot
---
This is possible but nothing the game really facilitates (vendor machines are on the way though). About the grind question. It's fallout a big part of the endgame and progress in general is grinding at times. Some time more so then others. Really just depends on your weapon and where you go for your materials. For legendary it will always be a grind. 
---
I've played enough to know how to avoid any unneeded grinding. Also have had enough time to do a bit of rp/trading or waste hours away just roaming around etc.. It will take some grinding for armor etc before you can stay a while away from home without having to return to not be overweight anymore. Also yes just roaming around can get you decent loot. Legendary enemies can spawn almost anywhere so no issue with that. 
---
If you are looking for specific player interaction I suggest trying to add people and just join their server (not team persee). There are quite a few groups that move together for queen farming etc. Being on a buddies server also helps with a ton of stuff.
---
&gt; Also the “Find new world” prompt is nice and all, but it literally never works, I just get eventually thrown back to the main menu. 
---
That particular problem never happens for me, but I've never hit that button and been put into a different world, it *always* puts me back into the exact same world.
---
Hemlock holes has 3 acid spots. I have my camp built just south east of there. there is another pool to put an extractor on.
---
I think I know of that. There is like a bus stop outside? From what I googled a few months ago the key doesn’t exist so maybe a future thing?
---
Also you can move the camp, scrap the blueprints and start fresh with mats. 
---
Underrated comment right here!
---
Picking stuff up over and over is just the current loophole that could get ANYONE banned, you could as well fill your inventory over a long time, craft it to safe space and still get banned.
---
Me? I didn't talk to him but he sure talked to several news pages. Shit's been all over the place for a while.
---
This is too good!
---
My Wife and I almost fell victim to this on Friday Night.  We were running our stream of new characters.  You opened the door, and my wife ran in, but I didn't.  The Deathclaw roared before she made it more than 5 steps in and ran back out.  I never made it in LOL.
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/392592089](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/392592089)
---
A few hours in a lobby with the Hemlock Holes workshop and you would have enough acid for awhile
---
&gt; and put flaming o it
---
I read this as "flamingo" and I was wondering what the hell kind of mod a pink bird would be. Now I kinda want to see it.
---
Mothman is a total voyeur. Look at those peepers and tell me you're not being methodically undressed in the mothmind.
---
Looks like Fasnacht, you can get one from Fort Defiance in one of the cells.
---
there is no evidence that dropping and picking it up will get you banned though. it is nothing more that a attempt at an excuse at this point.
---
you can claim as many maybes and what ifs you want, but that is all they are. 
---
Nah, dude. Executioners weapons or a VATS crit build.
---
Something has changed recently though. I've gotten like 4 different prime plans and a T-51b helmet plan from scorchbeasts in the last week give or take some days. 
---
Except for all the video evidence that's all over the place right now.
---
Yep it looks a lot cleaner. I still have to take time and do it all like that. Loose wires everywhere...
---
This literally applies to about 90% of video games these days. Not to be an ass, but get over it. Not really much you can do.
---
But you should appeal that. Mind if I ask, what were you specifically suspended for? 
---
Scrap every weapon and armor for decent upgrades. If your quest line leads you to savage divide before lv 30. Don't be afraid to hold back and level a bit. It gets rough there. You can play 76 solo but I advise not being a hermit all the time. Knowing one or two players on a server (or being able to join their server) has benefits. Use different types of ammo or melee for easier enemies (resource management). Also you can get around just using 3 tier1 damage cardss for weapons. In case you want to try new cards don't fell pressured to upgrade that t1 rifle card to t2 next level.
---
Also just enjoy it's not a race ;p
---
Nvm, I thought Bethesda suspended you. But yeah, that really sucks, not much you can do though.
---
It does say that though
---
Just saw we were the end of that video LOL

Garbage cheater. Stay banned :)
---
You know what is funny about that, is that myth popped up as a result of the Greek Dark Ages. Where they went from an advanced civilization to tribes. So people slowly forgot about things like trade, and couldn't remember why boats were going to certain islands. Thus that myth was born, where they believed people were sent on boats as a sacrifice.
---
Probably butchering the history of it, but that is the gist of what I remember.
---
got a link or 2? I thought there might have been something I missed, but when I google the only thing that comes up are old articles and vids about the ban wave. nothing that could be called evidence.
---
If you use radicool with unyielding healing factor isn't really bad from my experience. But if you are set on removing it, get lucky (radaway diluted) and buy serums. Sucks I know.

Scorchbeasts drops the plan for all dense mods.
---
Real fake doors!
---
Isn't he a BOS robot?
---
I have them. Max level. 
---
Can't really be a questgiver, as there's not much people wouldn't simply trade for. There are "you scratch my back" scenarios like providing mods and such. Lots of people are shopkeepers, either traveling or with a shop they've built. My favorite player camp ever has been a cafe/pawn/house with two stories, a balcony, and a restroom. Densest camp I've ever seen. I run a shop, but I have no base so no physical store. I trade on Reddit and the trade discord
---
Yep that’s the one. I looked all over the place for that damn key 😆 
---
ha that happened to me recently. my first thought was “dude maybe you need to lay off a little”
---
try going into the woods. whaddya mean i can’t gather this log? 🤪
---
The mire area further east. Taking places like dabney will give you a chance at fighting them as a defense round. Alternatively you could go to dabney (or dolly sods but has less chance from my experience) and jsut server hop till they spawn in as a  "Clear workshop from enemies" before capture objective.
---
Dumb.

Scorchbeasts or SBQ? Cause if it's scorchbeasts the RNG god is not with me

same thing happened to me, got a junkies black powder rifle and a mutant slayers wood right leg     
---
:( 
---
Question.... Can I unlock chest mods by scrapping arms? Or does it just go across light, sturdy, heavy?
---
Full luck and agility for starters. It will be hard until you're in the late 40s. Invest in 4 leaf clover, grim reaper sprint, critical savvy, and better criticals from Luck.
---
Try to find a legendary black powder pistol with +50% vats crit damage. Build your crit with a 10mm and then switch for massive crit damage. 
---
Normal scorchbeasts. Chance is low, they also have prime receiver plans. It's how I got all my dense plans.
---
OK thanks a lot
---
Power creep. Every game that lasts years makes sure all your shit is useless every once in awhile by adjusting the "max" level. 
---
Or managing the economy once dupes are fixed for good. 
---
First, you got suspended by Xbox.  Fallout 76 is irrelevant.  They'll suspend you for cursing in any game, including games that are WAAAAAAAY more adult than Fallout 76.
---
Second, ESRB ratings are a suggestion, with information for parents to decide if the kid should play it.  It's up to the parents to allow or forbid a game.  It's not a magic "no kids allowed" sticker.
---
I would rather them focus more on making the game require teamwork. The solo play goes against what I believe the whole premise of the game is (rebuild America). But I also believe they need to make servers more Permanent, and allow camps to stay after log off. So the player is actually given the feeling of rebuilding. 
---
I understand this is a very unliked opinion in the fallout fan base. But this game will never be what I can unless it decides if it wants to be solo with multiplayer elements or if they want to take it full on mmorpg.  I hope it becomes a mmorpg.  
---
Favourite your armour so you know it’s your armour

yeah you can run it but it will be at like 25 fps and most kids i know want 60 fps if not more

TSE... BB gun 🤣
---
Talking about the guy in OP's post, but if the boot fits
---
12 acid is enough for, I believe, 6 pieces of ore. An extractor does 10 in an hour. I think that the balance is out.
---
The difference is that in most other games that implement that system, it takes time and feels rewarding to get that stuff. Also, they usually max the player level too. In fallout, you can xp grind pretty quick and don’t feel the same excitement as those other games. Fallout simply doesn’t have enough content to gradually do that. 
---
sooooo no evidence then? this is the guy we are talking about. 300k ultricite ammo. and when called out on it claimed he dropped and picked it up multiple times and was banned for it. despite the fact that quests and challenges do not track things in this way. so they are effectively claiming that the tracking system for dupers is worse than the tracking system for the challenges....
---
the claim that he was banned for dropping and picking up ammo is nothing more than his claim. there is NOTHING to back it up.
---
Two words.... Strobe lights! I'm sure you're budgeted out but if you could add them it would be obnoxious. Awesome job! 
---
Hemlock Holes is my fave place but the acid doesn't seem to replenish on server hopping and seems to take a day to fully recover. Again, out of whack with ore production. 
---
Thanks, but I repeat, I know where ALL the acid is, including Hemlock Holes which as actually FOUR acid spots. Not even close to enough to keep an ore extractor going.
---
I represent a small group of Vault Dwellers that have had a similar fate with there C.A.M.P we are preparing a class action lawsuit on the grounds of the nuclear weapons are not properly secured it seems almost any Vault Dweller can talk with Modus proceed to shoot down a poorly armored and protected cargo bot retrieve a key card then fight your way through a missile silo to launch a nuke. 
---
I have no idea what even happened bro. I was just standing there in his doorway being burned and then the front of his house exploded and I got a bounty. Like.. how is that my fault in any way?
---
The gamer tag is information.  It tells them exactly where it is happening, and at least one person who lives there.
---
New content starts dropping on Tuesday. 
---
Why would you need to server hop? Capture it and setup the 3 extractors.  Add that to your regular enemy kills for acid and you would have more acid than you could use.  
---
Telling someone to go fuck themselves absolutely does not constitute verbal abuse or assault in "the real world". That would require some form of threat that invokes fear of retaliation.
---
happened once to me a few days ago
---
This game looks like the Sims.

I am so fucking happy I cancelled my pre-order.

Trap house. 
---
Your reaction is priceless
---
My husband said he saw a deathmaze of punji boards for low levelers the other day. It was a camp with a secret lower level of doom and every time a low level would start to fix something on a bench, the jerkoff would scrap the floor and the player would fall into the dungeon. There would be nowhere to run and no escape unless you had an X-01 jet pack. The guy tried to trap my husband too but this was not my husbands first Wasteland Rodeo. People are getting creative now.
---
Heh. Rod Swanson.
---
Maybe you were dead the whole time.
---
It’s just called “Bright Headlamp” or whatever headlamp you want. None of the mods say excavator in the name. You can buy the mods at Camden Park( lower left part of the map with rollercoasters) or the 2 vendor bot in Grafton. 
---
I would've loved to participate in this. This seems like fun for all ages. XD 
---
I would love to know the things they're yelling at you in surprise, LOL
---
Isn’t this how it goes already? As far as I know the amount of damage does not change based on level, but on the level of weapon used, perk card active, and buffs active. 
---
A level 100 using a level 1 board is not going to do much more damage then a level 1 with the same board (taking away the buffs for strength). 
---
The level I believe is more about showing how much of a bullet sponge it will be. 
---
That's why I move my camp around. Acid for a little, ore resources for a little. 
---
Im thinking of taking my shotgun sneak build, taking all my points out of luck and dumping them into str and end, get barbarian, the end damage/energy resist perk, and putting evasive on in place of action boy. Still sneaky, just i dont really use all my critical perk cards anymore since i switched from rifles to shotguns/stealth
---
I usually don't care for "griefing" type trap rooms, but this is an example of it done right. You don't invite them in under the guise of friendship and then pull the rug out from under them. You show them the door and let them decide if they want to take a chance. Of course it seems many of them immediately regretted their decision :P 
---
It is that's why i go to this location it's the fastest way I have found to get acid.
---
Nuka cola Grape for the win!  With rank 2 Cola nut you get 1200 rad resistance with no mutation suppression. 33 caps well spent.  
---
Thanks. Not sure what you meant about the 2 vendor in Grafton?  Is that the train vendor?
---
Tormentor
---
Yup, your spent caps don't get completely returned to vendor inventories. Means you can't buy everything in their stock and still come out with all their caps through bartering. The economy is slowed down super heavily in this game compared to the single-player games - if you want to make the big bucks you'll have to make some good offers on the trading subs.
---
Vendors only restock 25% of the caps they get when you buy something from them.
---
Yeah, I met a little kid on 76 too, I didn't want him to have a bad experience but its kind of hard since the people I play with swear a lot and like getting into fights.
---
The guy who used profanity against other person over a game. easy choice.  
---
Stop playing the victim card when you made a mistake.  
---
Also, It wasn't fallout 76 who banned you, it was your console. why post it here? you really want affirmation you're not to blame for getting banned, when that's just not going to happen.  
---
What's your fucking problem kid?
---
The Mire. 
---
Don't feel bad I'm almost 150 and if I don't know u or havent played with u before u get a bag on the ground, cuz I'm not worried about caps
---
There are no headlamp mods for the Excavator PA.
---
Aw, eat my ass dude. 
---
Well I don’t see why that’s an option in the game. They should probably do something to prevent it. I don’t mind being trapped and killed. I thought it was funny until I got punished for it and lost everything I spent hours getting.
---
I thought it was funny and creative until I was punished for it. I didn’t do anything and I lost everything. 
---
"oh shit sunrise..."
---
That’s the sort of thing that’ll get you banned
---
I did go digging in your history and found one of the youtube links you were talking about. I stand corrected there is evidence. though I would suggest using the youtube link rather than the 900 hour guy since there was no evidence when he made his posts.
---
Do you have reactive plates for x0-1
---
Or something like suck my dick and choke on my wad?
---
Sounds pretty strong. If I get a supressed instigating rifle, that would be awesome. 
---
It only displays the correct stat when it's equipped if it works like bloodied does. 
---
Omg stop youre killing me!
---
So robotivore
---
That sounds way cool. Is that a legendary armour effect? Or a mod?
---
No. Why don't you try being an adult and own your mistakes? The fact you didn't just switch servers, or block them, and instead elected to verbally harass them show me and everyone else that you're just a child who's playing an adults game.  
---
Again, then you went to Reddit to look for validation that you've been wronged, and are the victim. Neither of those things are true, and the sooner you realize that the sooner you'll become an adult. 
---
3500 caps
---
No there’s a responder bot there as well. The building is by the city hall building across the street. Has a responder wooden sign out front.
---
Thanks for the caps bro!
---
Ah yes - it's a great idea but I'm a solo player. I'm not into painting a target on myself. In any case, Hemlock would be the only place that could keep up and that satisfies just one person on a server...
---
This is why we need another crusade. 
---
Or just not let children on the internet.
---
Or a *cough* plauge *cough* would be just fine.
---
What if I say something like "go fuck your mother, Tanner, everybody else has already had their turn with her "?
---
If it's a console then cussing at a player in a message is considered harassment. I bait people into it all the time to get them suspended. It's a great way to get rid of trolls.
---
Not new. 
---
Weve been doing this for months. Thats why we like to PvP at your camp
---
😂😂
---
You know, if you're going for flux you really should make sure you nuke hits the train station, the service entrance and power substation as well as Whitesprings and the golf course. Other people might have different goals in mind with their nukes. Goals like cobalt flux. Your nuke zone experience sucks, but it's a spawn problem. Having it nuked is inconvenient for you, not getting that extra flux is inconvenient for others. 
---
I like your suggestion for a fix as long as it's a choice. Maybe some folks are looking for a nuke zone. 
---
No
---
Yeah, Green Thumb, Chemist, Super Duper, seems “mandatory” for crafting your own foodstuffs/meds and Weapon Artisan for keeping up with weapon repairs. Damn Super Duper seems nice. 
---
\-karma
---
lol, thats awesome!
---
K
---
But if you’re the one baiting and kissing people off, aren’t *you* the troll? Why don’t you do something better with your time, eh?
---
If you did it though XboX or PSN, I'm sure you'd be banned. My point isn't that you cant be obnoxious or vulgar on the internet, my point is when you ignore tos, its no-one's fault but your own when you get banned, and when you get banned for your own actions, you don't deserve sympathy. 
---
Looks like the mod's don't think your post is valid either. Enjoy your week suspension kid.
---
You know China is like the number one enemy of the US in Fallout right? They attempt to invade the US, that’s the campaign of Anchorage and the lore of the Liberators 
---
It's even funnier from those last two players' perspectives, by the way: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/392592089
---
It might be nice as a unique quest reward, but it would be bad for the general loot pool. Imagine killing a 3 star mirelurk queen, and getting a BB gun. In the plus side, it wouldn’t be one of the many useless melee weapons that get dropped on a regular basis.
---
Bob?! Do something! 
---
You can always make another character, earn them again and trade them back to your main account. Hell, if you’re on PS4 I don’t mind being the escrow, no charge 
---
You're not using Fallout to message people, you're using your console's messaging, and telling people to "GTFO" is against TOS.  
---
You made a mistake, deal with it.  You aren't the victim here, you did something wrong and were punished for it.  
---
This post doesn't belong here, its not relevant to fallout 76, its about whatever console you've decided to use.
---
I do it to people who do shitty stuff in game. Griefers, team killers, stuff like that.
---
There are no “daily events” and now you’re adding that your stuff disappeared? This is shady. 
---
I'm pretty sure its based on how many caps you have, not your level.
---
That's another good name.
---
By god, it's beautiful

The dragon might be worth selling, but only if it’s max level. The only things that reliably sell are max level items with 2 or more good modifiers, like anti armor, bloodied, two shot, explosive, quad, sentinels, assassins( for armor), unyielding, and weightless.
---
I find the nuke silo too long when playing solo, too. (haven't finished it yet, my friend are all below level 35 when I am nearly 90...)
---
Alright thanks for the input
---
Great, now we got "rust" level trollers. -_-
---
Screenshot buttons exist. 
---
Most of the time rad resist is pointless, except against ghouls and nuke zones. If good rad resist was available for regular armor, people would be running around with full unyielding armor, destroying everything they came into contact with in a single hit with melee, and taking barely any damage.
---
I only had 1500 when they started attacking me. They were taking 233 caps each time. Same as my lvl. I was only getting 60-70 caps from them. This went on for a few minutes before I decided to leave the server. Pretty sad that I gotta stick my tail between my legs and run from people well over 100 lvls lower than me because of their shitty pvp system. 
---
That is a good shout. I did just kill three scorch beasts, so probably have blight.
---
Thank you!
---
Upvote for being clever 😁
---
Giving yourself a "cap condom" before griefing isn't new; I've defended this game a lot and the whole "cap condom" thing is indefensible stupid design to me.  Though even among the "raiders" attacking a CAMP like this seems to he considered somewhat scummy.
---
You dont get fewer caps in a team, well you personally do, but only because PvP caps are split evenly among your team.  If he had a 5 cap bounty and you had 2 teammates you and one other person get 2 caps and the unlucky third gets a cap. 
---
You can lock the ammo collector so people don’t take it. If they are low level, a level 3 lock will stop their raiding.
---
There literally a ton of fertilizer bags lying around thought, i have much acid just grom deconing things.  
---
Not to mention the fact people can kill you before you’re even fully loaded in
---
You know where you find the x01 power armour blueprints. The mods also come in for sale there. Just go to the middle mobus terminal and thats a store.
---
It can take a lot of server hopping to find the mods you want.
---
Although the Optimized Bracers (Arms): Reduces AP requirement for Power attacks
---
I don't believe this does work cause it still takes 20ap per power attack with our without em
---
I hope this helps
---
Bounties should start at a number of caps equal to your level, then go up from there.
---
Lol... It's perfectly safe to have one, you're one of thousands. Don't overreact. 
---
The amount of caps lost in PvP is equal to your level. He’s 233 he loses 233 every death 
---
Why didn’t you run? I died twice to some guy who was taking barley any damage, and who would kill me nearly instantly with his TSE handmade. If you aren’t making any progress against them, swallow your pride and run.
---
I play solo as well and still take workshops. I have barely had anyone try and take my workshops. In a few hundred hours of playing it's only happened a handful of times. I know sometimes you get in a server with some assholes that will use the system against you but for the most part I get left alone. 
---
Power armor mods for x-01 can only be bought from the enclave vendor. Server hop until you find the mods you want.
---
I mean, if it takes you that long to load in bethesda can't help that. Slap damaged has been confirmed by users to be properly taking a long time to kill, and there is no way to get past that.
---
Happens on occasion. 
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH but I already got them and I have tried server hopping more than 30 times for the mod 
---
My Adrenal Reaction was working again yesterday!!! :) The stats in Effects did not update, but damage increase the lower my health was. Anyone else experienced the same?
---
I second this.  I enjoy jumping on top of buildings and it feels like playing a modded game. Also it helps since i suck at video games and i can jump on top of fences or whatever if i get overwhelmed by non-winged enemies. Also its fun to jump up to places that aren't necessarily meant to be found, then finding stuff (little teddy bear scenes or loot) that the devs put in. 
---
I don't know bit ill have to check it out and I'll let you know if I find it? I like having new stuff to look for
---
I drop loot there sometimes. Recently the mobs in Whitespring have been dropping tons of legendary, but my storage is almost maxed and I have to toss the ones I can't sell or keep.
---
Yeah it’s dumb. They should lose caps equal to normal caps loss upon PvP death, *plus* the caps from being wanted on top of that. Why would being wanted give them a discount on dying in PvP?
---
Sounds like they are considering making slap damage 0 and extending that to the CAMP as well. Making Pacifist a complete opt-out of PvP. Bring it on, I say. PvP is too messed up to force us to take part.
---
I was killing them. It’s just that they were allowed to take so much more from me. That’s my point. They cap you out after lvl but you keep losing more and more caps as your lvls scale. They make it out like a lvl 60 killing a lvl 200+ is some huge endeavor so they deserve to rape you out of money. It makes no sense 
---
Yeah, excactly. That shoudn’t be too hard, and the clock would be useful!
---
&gt; Pretty sad that I gotta stick my tail between my legs and run from people well over 100 lvls lower than me because of their shitty pvp system. 
---
You lost to what you called a "Pack" of griefers. IDK man just sure seems like you're upset you lost a 3v1 fight. maybe next time don't let them drain your caps if you care so much. 
---
I don't believe your mutations triggered pvp unless you have video.
---
I got it from a workshop event as well. I don't think it matters what one. 
---
4-1 actually 
---
You can't spell worth of shit but then you get extraordinary right? The fuck.
---
Obviously a deathclaw of the right level and type, as well as the right kind/level of megasloth. Mirelurk king too.
---
I was walking along the road south of Camden park. Just following the river.
---
so wtf is your issue then? Don't fight people 4v1 if you don't wanna lose your caps. Just leave the server, its not rocket science. You aren't a victim here, sorry.
---
"Do they gone"
---
Good god..
---
You be able to play right now?
---
That link talks about it a good bit. But I don’t remember it talking about 10mm specifically. If the damage goes down compared to hardened receiver I’d definitely say don’t do it though 
---
Mutations do trigger pvp. Since it causes damages. It sucks that’s why I refuse to run that mutation 
---
Yes, killed 3 near the ski left at top of the world.
---
My point is that they cap you out at level 50 and keep scaling the reward for people killing you with your levels as if you’re getting stronger which you are not. It’s not a huge win for a lvl 60 to kill a lvl 200+ therefore they should not be rewarded as if it were. I’m not claiming victim hood. I’m merely pointing out that their current system is flawed.
---
Whenever I make a trade with somebody that might be sketchy, I save a video of the transaction. Just in case, I need an alibi.
---
I mean, isn't this admitting you're a coward?
---
Taxation
---
Oh yes, I know. That sentence, upon reading it again, can be misunderstood. Sorry for that.
---
I'm not dismissing that Diseased overrides the Legendary prefix, I'm saying that the damage bug has nothing to do with this.
---
"A man got to have a code."
---
Good job, but how do you keep the aussies in? Won't people kill your death claw?
---
Aha! Understood. 
---
My friend, I look forward to that day.
---
I gather
---
Same, can confirm, fog crawlers  x3. 
---
Thanks, forgot i actually commented on that one.
---
That's been one of 3 such posts i've seen only today, posts that essencially replicate the original. One on the hot posts with like 1,8k ups or something along those lines..
---
There's even people right now who fear getting banned over crafting food to sell for caps. That banning system is sheet bs if you ask me.
---
Cheers, I’ll check it out
---
Saw a couple north of Dent &amp; Sons, South of the scenic overlook, in an unmarked campground.

I would love that.

I got the free atom clock and turned it sideways on my counter cause it looks like a toaster lol.

Ok, sweet I had no idea. Never seen one in game before and I couldn't find a single post about it.
---
Tame able?
---
But the in game clock appears on your pipboy 
---
Dude I dont even have a fraction of the time spent in game as the OP and my stash is always full, even with the new 800 limit my stash is already around 780, not because of guns alone but because of scrap(though fucking rifles are too damn heavy too.) If our stashes could apply our perks for weight management it wouldnt be so bad and people wouldnt need to make mule characters.  
---
But the fact that the term 'Mule' is a red flag for you, tells me you don't even know what the actual definition of a 'Mule' even is which by definition is literally a beast of burden Aka pack animal aka mobile stash, etc.  
---
I can not even imagine how heavy all of his stuff would be, add in their recent changes that made it even harder to go over a certain over-encumbered weight, he probably would have been making even more storage characters soon.
---
Personally, I have gotten to the point where I only attempt to sell 3*** and some really good 2** weapons and armor (with armor, I pretty much strictly only list the 3*** models). 
---
Unless I want to keep something for personal use, I dump all 1 * weapons and armor in the river behind my camp or in a random container in the wasteland. I also dump or drop all known plans except for a very small handful of “desirable” ones for resale. 
---
But that’s just me. I don’t waste time trying to get 3-4 hundred caps for low level or single * crap. Simply not worth the effort. When I list stuff for sake, I want it to be top end goods that will bring in a minimum of 1k per item, or close to it to make it worth my time. But like I said, that’s just me. 
---
Lol so sad that someone would then for this thread. Just looking for inspiration!
---
Go on
---
Ya I won't launch a nuke without a team to get back in the server with
---
Summer probably
---
I feel your frustration bud. But top notch smashing it out solo man can bet theirs not many people that ran the whole nuking mission solo.
---
I have had in game offers before to make camps for people before. You can team up with them and build from the ground up, but that's about it.
---
Picked it up today in Watoga hoping for silver lockers, sadly they're both named "locker" Which is stupid.  
---
Get to know them. It would suck to befriend another gamer for that purpose, but it'd likely help authorities to know more details. 
---
by point 3, yes, u can learn torso mods from scrapping arms.
---
r/Fallout is that way bud. No-one wants to watch a 2 hour video where someone re-iterates the same talking points that have been said over and over.
---
Post your specs if you'd like to disagree, but I bet you're not running the minimum requirements for the game. Its not Bethesda's fault you wasted money on a game you're not capable of playing. 
---
I enjoy playing alone because I can just play at my own pace and not have to let people tag the enemies, if there are people around I usually wait until they get tagged and kill them but alone is so much better for me, doesn't slow down the gameplay.   
---
I wish they'd add a proximity exp share system, makes helping people level such a chore.
---
For real. Once I started rocking a bloodied build emergency protocols is a no brainer
---
What will you sell it for? I'm interested in buying
---
Rags actually brought up a lot of new stuff that hardly anyone talked about. So strike one amigo.
---
thats odd it lets me drop mine with no problem
---
Well if Bethesda won't make the game fun to play, at least there are people like you to add enjoyment to the game. Well done!
---
I just have my camp on a deposit I run heavy Gunner build and have to make tons of bullets, I usually don't run out of acid and I go to lucky hole mine and get 500 lead ore at a time

---
The thing about pvp is it's a one shot thing if your not one shoting your dead. perks to help are the negate explosive damage and lone Wonder 
---
YES! But that would need to keep it like a rare drop so not everyone would have it! You could just sneak around doing like 4 damage but making the popping explosive sound!! It would be  great!
---
I love how the victims are eager to get in. 
---
Quality stuff.
---
Thank you very, very much. The game runs a lot better!
---
Strike 1? How about you're in the subreddit where people love this game, so we don't really care for the opinions of those who don't. Everyone knows it's a flawed game, it's just the good outweighs the bad.
---
I'm primarily a solo player on PS4. I constantly grab workshops because I like building complex camps for other players to visit. In all my many hours, I've only had a few people attempt to take my workshops so far. None have been overly aggressive about it either vs fun PvPing. 
---
If you try to take every workshop on the map, then yeah, chances are someone will mess with you. But I typically just server hop when my desired workshop is already taken...
---
Ive cleared the prison about 4 or 5 times and never got it to trigger. I even go out of my way to pass by the prison with no luck.

I love your sense of humor. Nice work. I look forward to the next one!

im running a 1080 and she has a 970 which are both above the recommended specs, we play Destiny 2 max graphics with no problems at all, its this garbage engine 76 is running on
---
You sir, are a genius. That was hilarious. 
---
If your on ps4 I’ll pay you to make me one
---
Let’s be honest, this game was rushed out.  This was one of those features that they probably looked at and scrapped because it’d be too much effort.  There really should be maps for interior spaces though.  It is easy to get lost in some places without a map.
---
thx man ill scope it out
---
It is perfectly legit. 
---
Yes, someone stating something that is factually incorrect is "strike one."
---
Nooo actually. This subreddit is tumultuous. There've been times where this subreddit has been filled with fans of this game and then there's been times where this subreddit is filled to the brim of negative responses. If you've been around this subreddit for any length of time, you'd know this.
---
Despite what you apparently think, this subreddit isn't a cesspool of fanboys in a fucking hug-box mate.
---
&gt; Deep Pocketed
---
You lucky bugger.
---
I mean honestly you'd come across some adults who act the same way. Not all kids are gonna be bratty and just harass you. But it is Rated M but that doesn't and shouldn't stop them from playing.   
---
Just bully them without sending them messages until they leave the server and take all of their caps,   
---
best thing to do to people. :)
---
I mean, I'm not ever going to waste two hours of my life on someone "reviewing" the game. Shill for this guy and hate fallout 76 all you want, but that doesn't change the fact a majority of people don't want to watch this garbage.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/az982y/the_way_country_roads_was_meant_to_be_played/ 
---
Same thing was posted 4 hours earlier.
---
I'd buy a castle from someone for sure. 
---
So in your little fantasy world, pointing out serious, objective flaws which makes a game absolute garbage is "shilling." Fucking lol. You're not the sharpest tool in the shed, are you?
---
You can chance it by only using one Diluted radaway at a time, I've found that only 1 out of about 6 cure a mutation.  Or like someone else said you can get starched genes, at the second level of the perk card your mutations are permanent.  Using radaway or rad-x then only removes their effects for the duration of the chem.  But once the effect runs out you will still have the mutation.  
---
Sorry on PC, I still don't think I will be selling them even if they are legit. Instead I'll just give it to anyone that asks and explain the situation to them. I don't really think it would be right to charge for something I got for free. Plus I need to find the guy who gave it to me and let him know that it is legit, I think I scared him also. Sounds like these are just going down a line.
---
lol level the perk card up to 2 and their permanent.  The first one must be what you are talking about because that just reduces the chances that your chem will remove it
---
You don;t lose any rads when you die, the only way is starched genes or taking a chance with diluted radaway
---
I don't know what's more sick, you for building it or me for finding it absolutely hilarious! That is deliciously evil! 
---
This is not true.  Dieing does not remove rads
---
I have so much i have to sell it. Never farmed for it either. You can have all mine if you want 
---
I must have also missed the point, because I didn’t see one 🤔
---
Seriously though, can you explain why you want this?
---
Yeah I do this lol
---
GG
---
Thanks for the laugh, well done. On a side note, YouTube will probably flag the song unfortunately.
---
If it was a mutation your negative aspect would be periodically having to stop to poop out screws.

Are you sure that you’ve taken photos at the right places? The challenge actually specifies the sites you should be at.

---
It is fun to hear your reactions to it haha
---
I've been asked to play this game with my family but I can't justify even buying a copy with the current state of the game.
---
My father and my brother both bought the game at launch for $60 and despite the mainstream critiques about the game, they both say that they love the game 100% and have a great time. I would love to play this game with them but at $60 there is just absolutely no chance I would bite at that price. I'm still holding out for either F2P to launch (I know they said they wouldn't do this but I press X for doubt) OR for them to heavily discount this game like 75% or more. I think this is just the kind of game that at $10 or $15 would absolutely fly off the shelves and bring a huge influx of players! Look at games like Black Desert Online (MMORPG), CS:GO (FPS), Gary's Mod (Sandbox), Terraria (Survival, building), Payday 2 (FPS). All those games can be bought for $10 to $15 and because of it they are massive impulse buys with huge playerbases. 
---
I know this is a bit off-topic but I think this is the kind of game that SHOULD be played with other players, the developers said so themselves. I think they should make this game more accessible to fulfill the 'play with real people' vision this game had. 
---
Welcome back. :D
---
Bethesda already said they’re not making it free-to-play
---
What is flux used for anyway. I've been just making it and selling it because it weighs so much. Just not sure what it's for 
---
Think about this way, the amount that the vendor's account goes up after you buy the item is the profit that they made.  The rest goes back to expenses, like a real business...   (grin)
---
If there is one thing that I would change, it's that the amount that the Vendor has initially should be based on the player level and it should go up by at least $100 every 25 levels.  level:  0 to 24 - $200,  25 to 49 - $300...   
---
That would make more sense as the more advanced plans cost a ton of caps and not everyone is into the grind  process (Queen kills or cap farming) to get there.
---
Please tell me you're on xbox? 
---
What mod?
---
This is amazing. I’m so glad people make the effort to do things like this, although will make me ever suspicious of random people in dressing gowns 🤣
---
No, the one where weapons in general weigh less?
---
Scrap it. There will be more 
---
True and true! I get so much useless junk it’s insane. But yes I think a hard quest would be a good idea! I haven’t got the paddle ball because of the senseless grind but I definitely would do it for a BB gun. Has to be lever action red rider style tho, no Olympic break down pellet gun. 
---
That's your video card man, not your system specs. Ram, HDD, CPU, all matter when it comes to preformance. I'm just guessing, but it seems as though you're not very tec literate when it comes to computers.
---

Your graphics settings are probably wrong. Read this post, adjust your settings. Its annoying when people baby rage about games on PC not running optimal when they haven't taken steps to optimize their graphics settings. PC gaming will always take more effort than console, that's the trade off.
---
Sometimes I think that the level of the enemy and the items that they drop is influenced by how long it's been since they have been attacked.  It could just be confirmation bias but I seem to find more 2\* and 3\* in the wilderness in the Mire when there are a lot of low level players on the server vs high level.
---
No.  Oddly enough you have to do the *Enclave* quest line to get that.
---
&gt;!The end of the BOS quest line does point you at the enclave, but you can start it independently if you're lucky or in the know.!&lt;  
---
Yeah.... but not gonna be as awesome as ppl  hyping for im pretty sure of. And all bugs that are gonna come with it. But can always hope for the best 👍
---
Unbelievable. So I had another nuclear key card. Went back to the silo and did it all again. Had some random players help this time. Got to the final terminal, put my card in, went to put in the code and was shut out. Apparently there is a 2 hour wait period between launches. But it kept my card. Double fuck. Good night for real this time. 
---
You can also find Excavator PA mods at Camden park vendorbot
---
No, I'm saying you're Shilling for this rags guy. You didn't post any discussion on anything he said, just said "I agree with this guy he's right and so am I". You posted an anemic post that had nothing to contribute other than a link to a video you like.  
---
I'm not going to sit here and say fallout 76 is perfect, I also won't waste two and a half hours watching a video criticizing *any* game, not just fallout 76. It's obviously riding the "oh man Fallout 76 is bad" Eco chamber, so therefore a lot of people are going to see through that and find no value in that video.   
---
it sure feels like the only reason your here is you really like the "Fallout 76 is a terrible game" Echo chamber, and were either hoping to have people agree, or just wanted to upset those who don't. Neither really happens, since people who like fallout 76 don't need to waste hours of thier lives exploring the opinons of some guy they don't know about it, and people who hate the game have generally moved on by now.  
---
r/Fallout is the echo chamber you're looking for, since this post contributes nothing other than to fuel a flame-war or jerk each other off for having the "right" opinion.
---
People claim to have found them on scorched
---
So Wallace with his *smooth voice* is a liar.
---
Because pointing to a video which systematically goes over many, serious flaws with 76 is totes shilling for said person who made review. Legit, you're a fucking moron. 
---
Here's a question for the ages. If I posted King Crocoduck's refutations to Eric Hovind in a subreddit about creationism, would you be demented enough to say I'm shilling for King Crocoduck?
---
Thats kids for you. In an ideal world their parents would parent instead of punishing adults for being adult in an adult game. Maybe on the future it will be accepted in society to have a space intended for adults in gaming. 
---
*charges off cliff*
---
Also, a quick look at your comment history makes me even more secure in my belief that you're just here to try and get a response since it looks as though you've never posted here before, or in r/Fallout. Happy this will be the first and last time I'll have to interact with an internet troll like yourself.
---
First silo took me around an hour when I was lvl 30, now I can do it in 10min tops, the longest part is the launch sequence 
---
Takes under 10min in a power armor and a bone stock gatling 
---
Actually, I occasionally drop into this subreddit, so this isn't my first time posting in this subreddit. because unlike you, I actually care about the quality of the games I play and have no qualms about voicing my severe disappointment in shit products.
---
You automatically view any objections to 76 as "trolling" This makes you an inbred simpleton, a fanboy and a complete fool.
---
dude i shouldnt have to run through hoops when i pay full price for a triple A title especially when other games (that look 10 times better i might say) run perfectly fine, also you dont have to be a genius to lay out basic system specs i just figured people cant possibly think i'm buying Fallout 76 to play on a fucking toaster
---
No, having a discussion about a video that you posted, where you give your own input would be constructive. What you've done is post a video then said "Lol 76 bad heres a poorly edited, dragged out video that agrees with me on points i don't care to even bother to talk about because I'm not here for discussion, I'm here to try and get this video infront of others".  
---
Your goal was to get views for this Rags person, or try and illicit a response from people to validate yourself. Either way, its just sad.   
---
25% upvoted seems to say that most people here agree with me.
---
Don't be afraid to take workshops.  When you do take one, first build a stash box.  Go on a supply run between your resource extractors and dump it in your stash box as quick as you can.   As long as you don't have any important junk in you inventory when you die, you don't lose much.
---
Another poster also gave this advice.  If you own a workshop and it's under attack don't go to defend it.  Eventually the "recapture" event will pop up and it will tell you what took your camp.  You can then decide to recapture it or not. 
---
Finally, look at the map before you take the workshop and check for Wanted players.  People playing as a Raider tend to become Wanted.  Also, if there are a lot of low level players (30 or below), then you should be golden.  Most players don't start playing as Raiders until after the quests are complete and they start getting legendary items (i.e. Bloodied or Instigating).
---
Legendary or not, Heavy BOS combat armor is better than every armor in the game in terms of balanced rsistances.
---
Well yes and no,  say you and I are trading, I ask for a trash 10mm then some random gun above your fancy TSE handmade. While your selecting the price of the random gun above your good weapon I take the 10mm. The ENTIRE list shifts up one item and you sell me your TSE for 100 caps. If your not careful you can lose a great item on accident if the person is a scumbag. They need to fix the spacing inside the trade menus when items are removed, like a temporary empty spot holding all the items still till a price is chosen. 
---
I said “looking” not “are”. And Bethesda has said a lot of things and done the exact opposite time and time again. But the point of the post was about gamestop and free guides. Not what Bethesdas marketing plan is.
---
Yea that’s what I need do you know how to get plans also what’s the max lvl also is it modable?
---
That's my bad, when I found your posts for 76, they are all just you bitching about the game. Glad to see this bothers you so much that you have to continually ttry and get people to see things your way.  
---
Also, you have a real tendancy to just go for straight Ad Hominem fallacys in like, 80% of your posts. really strange. 
---
You're too late, Anthem's the new game to shit on. 
---
I feel like this is a right of passage. You haven’t REALLY played FO76 until the server crashes immediately after you launch a nuke. 
---
Whjat do tyou want to talk about then? he complete lack of a story, the lack of interesting NPC's (all of them are fucking robots,), the fact that Bethesda just asset flipped a topnne of shit fropm Fallout 4, the fact that the Scorch Beasts are literally just Skyrim dragons re-skinned, the fact that there's a lot off dead-time in an fps game (which is a cardinal sin), the fact that the AI are the real life version of Simple Jack from Tropic Thunder, the fact that ethesda is fucking lazy when it comes to games and just keeps on tacking on a whole bunch of stuff to a very old engine? At least with Morrowind, they had a legitimate excuse, but nowadays? Hell fucking no. There;'s no ercusefor that sort of laziness and incompetence.
---
You want to claim I'm a troll now, you fucking mong? I mean, I can keep oin going if you want. I can keep on listing the myriad of issues that 76 has. How about the PVP implementation not only being absolutely brain-dead, but not even making sense because of the narrative? I can keep on going all night. It's not like I'll run out of content when it comes to highlighting just how bad 76 is.
---
Man I’ve been one of the very critical people about this game and haven’t played since I think week 3 or 4. After seeing this awesome creation, I am seriously considering installing the game again.
---
You need to learn the difference between an ad-hom and insults. Get with the times, boyo.
---
True, but it's always fun to go back and poke fun at other shit games. Still a bit salty with Anthem. I don't get how Bioware could go from Balduur's Gate to Anthem. 
---
I'm thinking so, I mean if you're willing to go on the PVP server you better be willing to lose some crap. They have to add more risk to it to be really thrilling. Let's just say nobody's going to have their best Three Star Equipment on probably.
---
Still expanding the Syringer healing mods is a great idea, making the groups "healer" Even more effective then just mashing stimpacks to splash heal the group, 
---
gtx 1060, amd fx 8150, 8gb ram, running off hdd
---
Also Grape Nuke cola gives you tons of rad resistance with no suppression. 
---
Update to this: I've started a 2h charakter as of yesterday myself (originally planned to rebuild my 1h char but i've missed out on a lot of modifications trough selective picking to reduce my carry weight) and let me tell ya, it's worlds appart...
---
I'd honstely place regular unarmed close to 1handet melee (since higher damage, less boni and all, maybe even somewhere between them) and while you could add a additional mutation on unarmed, i'm convinced that 2h is the better choice. Be it on a stealth build (no significant multipliers compared to 1h eather way), on a luck focused one  (criticals mid fight, bloody mess) or a combination of both (11/8 is where it's at for me) cause the difference in damage base is just gigantic. And don't even get me started on the legendarys (seen the stats of Grognak's axe yet? Oh boy...)
---
I honestly think they will ..they don't really have any thing to lose.. as Fallout 76 players are pretty much a case study on what works and what doesn't and when they finally fine-tune it it will be a great road map for their next game or games involving multiplayer.
---
Yes, but it's already a great game regardless. I'll be honest I wanted to like this game more than I did till I hit lvl 20. Fron there on it really took off was the old fallout I remembered but better. There are bugs and a few things need fixing but the really huge ones, that should have been fixed before release seem to be sorted out or slowly being addressed. All new games have bugs or need balance in some form, dont let that detour you from a good game.
---
Yet still $60 here in good old Canada lol 
---
A real time day/night cycle is a 24 hour day/night cycle. This would have to be set to SOME time zone, so I'm assuming you're assuming yours is the "right" one. 
---
Also in general your idea is fucking stupid. 
---
Wait till they aren’t selling them, they will eventually go down in price
---
I've always rolled a Tank in every MMO....  Ever...  Lol I tried to make it work here on 76 but there's little point as were all stuck with basically the same DR and little difference in HP after life giver and maxed Endurance,  but what we truly lack is a way to hold aggro. I'd love a legendary weapon that taunts the enemy into attacking me over the rest of the team. 
---
I mean, bethesda has a track record of lying over a lot of shit (especially around this game). But if they don't deliver on this roadmap, even the ardent defenders are going to have a pretty hard time defending it, not that they won't find a way. 
---
That is down in price lol games are $90 here normally 
---
I'm running it on a 3gb 1060 GPU on a laptop, and all my issues are server/internet/bug related. 
---
Ahhh, I see
---
I'm not surprised of being suspended I'm surprised that a child who shouldn't be playing an adult game that has swearing, blood, and gore reported someone they were harassing.
---
This is my favorite TLDR
---
Literally said I cant appeal.
---
It's not going to get fixed the mutation is doing exactly what it says it does, so it's not really bugged. drop the mutations that trigger pvp.
---
Really? I must give it another try, but the silo was longer than "all rise" durability! 
---
&gt; dude i shouldn't have to run through hoops when i pay full price for a triple A title especially when other games (that look 10 times better i might say) run perfectly fine 
---
That's nice that some triple A games can run just with graphics presets that work better, but no, you shouldn't expect that your game isn't going to need some adjustments if its on PC. Its almost impossible for any game dev to properly utilize all the different configurations, so they cast the widest net possible, which often means the end user has to adjust things to work better on their systems.  
---
No, Bethesda's game engine is far from the best one on the market, but it also isn't garbage. That's hyperbole at best. 
---
If you have an Android phone,  there's an app in the Google shop called Fallout 76 Interactive map,  not only is it a great map,  but it allows you to make custom map pins anywhere that only you can see.  Or you could submit them to be added to the already existing pins.  Maybe far more helpful than writing them down and trying to add them to a map later? 
---
simply incredible
---
what system u on? if i may ask
---
honestly the game runs smoothly when it isnt stuttering lol
---
I'll play along, I'll watch the review.
---
&gt;You want to claim I'm a troll now, you fucking mong?
---
I mean, yes. Your original post didn't bring up anything other than you Shilling rags, and now you're bouncing between making short vulgar arguments and *trying* to insult me.   
---
So yea, you're a troll. Most of your comments on Reddit are you just flaming people you disagree with, and your actual points about the game aren't presented in any manner other than you obviously trying very hard to just pile things you don't like together. The criticism you've levied, while some of them are valid and could certainly be discussed further, has been said one thousand times over, and isn't contributing anything other than letting everyone know just how mad this makes you.  
---
You might not run out of straw man arguments for how bad the game is, but its clear most people run out of patience with you long before then. Hope whatever has made you such a bitter angry person goes away, otherwise it sure seems like you're going to be this hostile and angry forever.
---
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey XD. Lol, Make yourself a cuppa beforehand, it's long as.
---
Xbox 1
---
I've been using 391.01 since forever, since I run into horrendous stuttering and frame drops on PUBG with any driver over 4xx.xx. If you have a Pascal card, I don't see any reason why you would update to the lastest drivers, except for maybe freesync support.
---
On Italian Amazon the boxed game for the 3 platforms currently costs 25 euros
---
That's actually a mod they added to the Creation Club for FO4, so not completely out of the realm of possibility. Might even space out the well known xp farms.
---
No use posting about that here. According to this sub you're a bad person automatically, Bethesda is the messiah, Fallout 76 with less players is better overall so they can have their single player fantasy fleshed out more. 
---
And to answer as far as I know, no one, none of the people irl I know who've been banned even have gotten the email detailing what items they have, nor have any received a response to their tickets.
---
Yeah, but on PC you don't need addresses and shit like that. PS4 and Xbox maybe. But I can make a dozen gamertags right now and be completely anonymous.
---
how secluded you want to be?
---
Very
---
Exactly.  I agree.  
---
I'll spend 40 caps to travel across the map to collect a 5 cap bounty. If your pvping for caps your doing it wrong. I get its unfair, that they get more caps if they kill you. The solution is to just kill them, they want to pvp so they will keep coming back, get their caps then.
---
There is a junk extractor south of the golf course right next to the highway. That's the one I use, not only because it feels like a place housing could have been done and has a beautiful view, but also because junk extractors are great. 
---
you on now?
---
I guess that’s mostly my problem. I don’t care for losing caps this late in the game. It’s a moral thing I suppose. 
---
I'm glad it helped! 
---
I grabbed a 20$  EU key from G2A, used a proxy to say I was in the UK to verify the code on my Bethesda account. Worked great for my second account. I'm canadian as well so I know that feel.
---
Uuuuh, I love this! You are cray cray, but dam this is good. And made me giggle.
---
Unfortunately I've never seen them again. And I only recall a part of their gamer tag.
---
I wouldn't waste your money on it, i bought it even though i heard all the bad reviews, and i really wish i hadn't.  It's terrible.  
---
msg me i'll invite you to my game show you my spot GT Tanaas 
---
Thanks! I wasn’t sure if i should buy it.
---
Send me a link please. 
---
Except you've admitted to getting a 5 cap bounty by destroying players camps just to kill them with no risk to yourself. Sorry bud, but since you abuse game systems for gain, you're a griefer.   
---
Just doing pvp doesn't make you a griefer, but finding ways to mitigate your losses that obviously were not intended makes you one.
---
I really really enjoy it. I find it pretty stable and the bugs aren’t common enough to bother me in my experience. Watch a play through of some of it on YouTube maybe, if you need to decide. Also yes weapons do still break. 
---
But they are not 'looking' at going free to play. If you get the basics wrong then what else have you got wrong
---
I flame people who are deserving ofg it. You sdon't like that I take a problerm with pseudo-science for instance? Touygh sahit.
---
Straw-man arguments? Every single point I have broughjt up thus far are serious problems with 76 and by extension, how Bethesda approaches game development., And you want to claim that they're straw-men?
---
\- Bethesda **did** assert flip a lot of shit from fallout 4. This is why some terxtures can be muddy as fuck, yet other textures are a lot sharper in stark comparison.
---
\- The Scorch beasts **are** reskinned dragons from Skyrim (there's code in 76 which refers to the fucking scorchbeasts as dragons
---
\- There is a tonne of dead-time in 76. Scoping issues, constantly having to reload because of stupidly bullet-spongey enemies (oh yeah, and the distribution of enemy levels is flat out retarded - no logic is applied to that, so that's fun)
---
\- The AI are dumb as fuck. They'll just stand there while you unload magazine after magazine into them. Pathing issues are abundant - enemies in 76 are some of the dumbest I have encountered in any video game. Ever. A fucking log in the ground or a knee-high wall is impossible for them to traverse.
---
\- Bethesda **does** in fact copy over a lot of stuff from previous games and they keep on adding shit on to an engine which cannot handle it. You ever wond ered why there have been bugs in 76 which were in fallout 4? Hell, there were bugs in 76 which were present in **fucking MORROWIND! M.O.R.R.O.W.I.N.D.**
---
Tell me you jumped up idiot. Which one of any of that is a straw-man? Go ahead. Make my bloody night. You want to claim I'm nothing more than a troll?  A troll doesn't back up their arguments with factual statements. A just tend to be a bit more cynical these days on account on my being surrounded by complete morons.
---
So,  not sure if anyone else can confirm,  but having high intelligence seems to effect my XP gain,  vs my girlfriends.  Well kill the same enemy no perks or well rested and I get more XP everytime?? 
---
Also,  Sleeping  for the Well rested bonus. Eating Canned meat stew,from the Feed the people event. Cranberry Relish, the recipe is found at White springs shops.  Finding a Leader Bobble head all grant an XP boost,  as well as The Path to Enlightenment event at the light house near the Vault. If you can max out the Inspirational perk card and run with a team mate,  also the XP is shared among the team of they're close enough together. 
---
This is awesome, great work. 
---
Well, holy shit.  I had no idea you had to click on the challenge to see the specifics.  That said this game has been so buggy I've just gotten into the habit of assuming I'm always right and they're always wrong.  My motto is, "Often corrected, but never humbled".  In all seriousness though, thanks Benji for setting my dumb ass straight on this one.
---
I didn’t say I pvp for caps. I pvp because it’s the only endgame content that doesn’t get as repetitive and feel rewardless. The caps is a nice bonus although I don’t really need it. The purpose of this post is so others less equipped to defend themselves don’t fall for this exploit. The guy doing this to me only killed me like once or twice outta 20+ times. I enjoyed it. It’s a moral thing for me 
---
Dont be a grammer facist its best I can buddy as a foreign language.
---
me to. god damit. 
---
i think it might have been me. When i enter PvP i always destroy a fence/wall/potted plant so i won't lose anymore. I also often attack players doing things at their workshop because you can just claim it and attack him a second later and they will have no time to defend.
---
don't blame the player
---
blame the game
---
Thanks, but is there a way to counter that, or is it just a factor if life in fo76?
---
It’s pretty expected wear and tear imo. You fix them at workbenches using a fair quantity of resources. 
---
Insulting people directly instead of dismantling their argument is ad hominem 100%, sorry bud.
---
I appreciate you don't like the game. I do find it odd you'd still look through this forum though if it's that bad just to tell people it's terrible.
---
I paid full price for it when came out and I really enjoy it, sure it's buggy but improvements are being made and I still look forward to playing it.
---
For some of the prices I've seen it selling for I'd say it's with a try! 
---
You are most welcome 👍🏼
---
Now, be aware that some of the challenges actually ARE bugged though...some of the ”survivor story” holotapes and discovered locations won’t mark as complete for me. I’m sure there’ll be a fix eventually!
---
Physical copies are really cheap, I think they over-shipped them.
---
I still follow this subreddit in case anything changes and the game actually gets good.  This person asked for opinions and im sure they appreciate all opinions, not just "yes buy the game"
---
I guess it all comes down to what you prefer. Grognak's Axe is nice but right now it's bugged. It can't be repaired to 200% and it breaks way too fast. 
---
Personally, I prefer Unarmed simply because the weapons are faster than the 2 handed ones. I ran with All-Rise for a couple dozen levels until I found a Bloodied Power Fist. The damage that thing deal when you are low on health is just ridiculous. Of course, Bloodied has it's downsides but death in this game means nothing. :)
---
By far the most Fallout thing I've ever seen a player do. Magnificent. 
---
It happens. I've seen at least two or three times. Actually got some decent drops on one of them though it was nothing I could really use for my general build.
---
Perks help with guns,  but some still break too easy, dlc is free &amp; you'll get more hours out of it than you would a lot of other games.
---
How many games have you purchased &amp; only got say 20 hours out of it - this isn't one of those games. At 20 hours you are still just scratching the surface. I would say this is easily an over a 100 hour game. I purchased 4 copies at launch &amp; don't regret it one bit, not all for me obviously :)
---
I'm level 170 now &amp; yes I've hit a bit of a wall, with not a lot else to achieve, explore, but with dlc hitting soon &amp; more planned for later in the year, I think its the perfect time to buy.
---
So I'd say yes.
---
Is it perfect - no, is it getting better - yes
---
Don’t buy the game full price whatever you do.  Look for a deal where you can get a physical copy for cheap.  The game isn’t worth it at all at full price and it’s honestly barely worth it on sale.  The game has a lot of very serious balance issues that I dont think are getting fixed any time soon.  
---
You did read the pvp warning right??
---
They have been around from the start, drop alot from dogs at sbq and there's one on a corpse at the freak show in a cage. Would be cool if they put in companions though!
---

---
Secluded, lake, regular behemoth spawn, some flat ground, what else could you want? 
---
My flatmate, fiance and I all bought it at midnight on release and played it for a week non-stop. It was a painful myriad of bugs but it was finally a fallout multiplayer and there were so many mechanics we loved.
---
After finishing what we considered the main story, around level 65, the bugs and broken game got too much and we quit.
---
We came back early this week with our eyes wide open. Saw countless patches and ~50gb worth of patches. It seemed it was going to be so much better. It took no more than 15 minutes to realise nothing had been fixed and what broke the game still did. It took no more than 2 hours to become so frustrated to uninstall it from our ps4s and go back to other games.
---
Tldr; you're exactly right and it's such a crying shame. Bethesda are/were my favourite developer but this has tarred my image of them as a company.
---
Funny, but heartbreaking. Classic Fallout I guess 🤷🤣
---
Hahaha! That is hilarious! So glad you clipped it. On my end I could hear the deathclaw growling behind me the whole time, so when your wife ran in and then immediately back out it was so funny to me I had to put it on the end, haha!
---
A-holes putting the blame for their a-holiness on anything but themselves...
---
Can you please elaborate on challenges cause I can not find a tab on pipboy with challenges 
---
This is pretty great and creative. Very challenging to find the right people I bet. 
---
If anyone has marsupial, they can just jump out. Or good sneak/decent gear to negate the threat.
---
Love the fake doors though and seeing people fall for it lol. Job well done on the entertainment!
---
The heavy combat armor plans seem to appear randomly on the traders at harpers ferry and the two in watoga. Max level I think is 50 maybe 45 and combat armor is widely moddable I have dense on my chest peice but I've unlocked lead lineD, deep pocketed, lightweight and lead lined.
---
Alot of people say marine armor is better for ballistic damage but combat armor helps against all damages.
---
We dropped a good bag of legends last night just to the side of the vendors bar. All high level one stars. Could of been our bag. Few anti armors in there. 
---
I hope they don’t change it. I just came up with this quick-rich plan with my buddy and we’re about to carry it out. 
---
Since the entire pvp mode was built around encouraging player-on-player crimes, especially on those who aren’t interested in pvp, why not take advantage of it. I’m at level 300 and have all kinds of explosive, bloodied weapons and sentinel armors (not yet full set), Bethesda made it super easy for those who exploit lower level players with zero punishment. 
---
-
---
1: buy a bobby pin from my buddy for 20k to empty my account
---
2: shoot a piece of wall to put 5 bounty on me
---
3: the fun begins when I slap new players to death, thank you Bethesda. If they fight back they don’t have a chance. They will have to leave to avoid the loss. 
---
4: if i get killed by accident, the bounty hunter receives zero caps since I emptied my account. I can keep going and never worry about losing any cap. Thank you Bethesda. 
---
5: after all the winning I will split the profit with my buddy.
---
6: repeat the process until 25k.
---
7: thank you Bethesda.
---
In Survival mode you will lose some of your aid items as well. There is no confirmation yet on exactly what you will lose, though.
---
we are not done with her quest yet .........no one has cleared this from thier game yet
---
You don’t need to buy it full price, I just got it for £16 on Xbox brand new. Only played a few hours so far but not hit any bugs yet. I’ll looks beautiful but feels empty with no people. Guns degrading was a thing in fallout 3 too it could always be a little annoying but did add to the experience. 
---
I use 419.35 as well, and it does seem to stutter a bit more. Also, at present there is an issue with Windows 10 that affects game performance. Microsoft confirmed it and will release an update soon.
---
Most likely.
---
And Lead Belly is because of cannibalism (because a seperate perk for eating people appearently doesn't mean that you can process them)
---
I've allways been a cannibal in beth games and i sure ain't gonna dropp it for the sake of min/maxing. It at least pays itself off with the reduced stimpacks and food consumption 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Might need to visit a railway station toilet first to loot some toilet paper roll. Or just use prewar cash. Both give cloth.
---
does it run okay on the xbox one?
---
I'm still in shock that when I step back and count what the game has to offer its laughable. There's only one quest in the entire game with a S.P.E.C.I.A.L. check, when you sink those toxic barrels. the endgame "boss" is literally the exact same fight as any other scorchbeast in the game, just with more health. There are "3" nuclear silos except they are completely identical. there are no PVE/PVP server selections available, we are all just stuck together in a world of lore-breaking pvp between mostly unwilling participants because without shooting each other the game would run out of things to shoot in 5 seconds.
---
How is this supposed to work? We aren't all playing in same timezone.
---
Haha that was awesome to watch
---
Anywhere but Whitesprings golf course near the clubhouse. ;)
---
You know what, it’s a shame you don’t have fun playing the game and I hope other current games serve you better. But why don’t you just go on and leave fo76 behind you? There’s no need to tell us that you’re not enjoying it, because nobody here gives a single shit. I’m enjoying it and having fun, that’s all that matters for me. Or you can create a new subreddit just for players like you who don’t want to play the game but won’t stop complaining either. I totally see that the game has many substantial flaws but I do think the game improved a lot since launch. And I dont need 25 internet randoms per day explaining me why I shouldn’t have fun and why I shouldn’t be playing anymore. 
---
I've been playing since release with my camp as the true end game. It's beautiful, fully functional, and thoroughly decorated. Completely to the budget limit without turrets. It could all be yours for the low price of 2,500 caps! Hurry and invest in a *proper* camp for you and yours. Warning: all sales are final. Property built near Whitesprings may be subject to complete nuclear annihilation at a moment's notice.
---
Aren't you the guy with the death church and all that? Great stuff haha!
---
A few days after launch (on xbox) i found a nice crafting area on the back of the church... Then realize it was a player camp. Later that week, i accidentely deployed my camp behind the houses in a tiny space on the bottom of that cliff. Was so surprised. Ever since i wonder why nobody ever build around there.
---
And I can see it getting worse. People using vending machines to get you to enter their traps. 
---
There’s a number of uses, stable flux is needed for some but not all P.a mods, e.g calibrated shocks, you need it to make the shielded lining of under armours, the protective lining I think too, it goes into mutation serums as an ingredient, and you need it to craft a prime receiver for your weapon if you have the plan and then the ultracite ammo that goes with that receiver. When it comes to raw flux that can be used for crafting orbital strike beacons
---
All have my friends have bailed, haha.  If not for the OP TSE combat shotty and TSE AK given to me, I don't think I'd be able to make it.
---
They really should buff the prime versions to make them true end-game weapons, at least make them 30% better than hardened when dealing with scorched/zealots. Right now it’s like why the hassle. After all the hardwork of collecting and making fluxes you get no return at the moment. 
---
do you just not have much going on these days?
---
Its 3 hours from the instant you launch a nuke.  You cant launch another from whichever silo you used and no one on the server can launch one from the silo you used.
---
If you went to either of the other two silos or had one of the randoms in your new server launch it you would have been fine.
---
yawn. who gives a shit. work it out for yourself
---
 
---
wow that sounds fucking dull 
---
nobody cares about the video you made 
---
... I didn't make it
---
Nah. It was fuckin' great.
---
i stopped playing rainbow six siege because of all the fucking children there. sometimes i feel like you should have to prove that you are of age when playing adult games online.
---
I would love to find a level 45/50 legendary two shot explosive 10mm, now that would be awesome. 
---
THIS GUY MAKE ME JUMP AND SHOOT AND TRIGGERED ALOT OF SUPER MUTANTS
---
I would have honestly felt sad to have killed a tamed deathclaw.
---
its easier for parent to pick up a ps4 or xbone for their kids birthday or christmas than to buy a pc and get them through the setup. i know its easy for us but my father for example asked me to do it for him. 
---
Thank you.
---
A used copy would be cheaper so maybe grab one off eBay if your on console in case you try it and don’t like it, having said that there are those of us who love it, bought the copy full price and still sink a lot of hours into it, seems to be one of those love it or hate it things and while it’s had its bugs along the way if you really love it you play around them and find work around’s till they can be fixed. I have absolutely no regrets in buying this game (even at full price) but ultimately you’ll have to decide whether it’s worth a gamble for you at the price you can get it for
---
This is a very rust-esqe thing to do, I applaud
---
How do you prove that you didn't do anything in the time in between that could have gotten you banned?
---
I put on my robe and wizard hat.
---
I ran through Glassed Caverns again as a test. If I don't touch the Ultracite no extra Scorched spawned but when I did it would spawn 6-8 enemies.
---
The other day i decided to go through Whitespring. I entered where the wall is broken, went south to the gate where the road cross it. Then one of thoses spawn. The robot didn't cared so i began running away following the road inside. Two other of thoses spawned !
---
I had a bit of trouble fleeing, they kept following me. I think i had to find a door to the shopping area.
---
Uh, garden gnome for the concrete... wat? O.o
---
I would be down if it had some attributes from Wasteland. Maybe a unique legendary effect that more easily cripples heads or lowers target accuracy. 
---
Fireproof makes you pretty much ignore flame or explosive damage. So, molotovs, flamers, explosions in general and the rapid fire attack from SBs. It's a nice perk to have. :)
---
Its a shame that people think the subreddit where Bethesda community managers hang out is a bad place to post about issues being had with the game. why dont you check my post history and see all I've contributed before you try to shut me down for voicing my point of view on the state of the game? 
---
No, everyone claiming they got banned for crafting too much were lying.
---
I much prefer to play solo, that said I do occasionally team up with random players; no chat, (I find it really distracting) but happy to text chat to clarify objectives and pool resources. I have befriended a couple of like minded players who I team up with more regularly but when in a team we're off doing our own thing; coming to each other's aid every now and again. 
---
Don’t believe every review you see on the Internet, I’ve had tonnes of negative “click bait” vids come up in suggested videos on you tube, if your Dad and brother are playing it and enjoying it they’re the best people to go to for an honest opinion, even without the roadmap there is a lot of fun to be had with this game, the roadmap is just the icing on the cake and there’s no way they won’t deliver on what they have set out as that would cause a massive backlash by its fan base and result in another P.R nightmare
---
Lvl 17 right now. Others say you have to be lvl 20 in order to use it.
---
no i think you pretty much covered it "such as the level of weapon and level of customization already on it."
---
This is hilarious, and of course all in good fun... but there are those classic trolls we all know and hate who do this to people to loot them. Kinda sucks.
---
Here is a post from someone who just experienced something similar to The Oven

[Lured in, trapped, killed, looted. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/azczxb/can_someone_explain_this)
---
Gotta love the guy laughing about it in the comments. 
---
I hope you learned not to give e your shit away and if someone needs something they can pay up
---
PS4 thanks for the offer
---
When I first started to mod oblivion I spent like 3 hours in one sit. Then I went outside and was like: "Wow, this water has such nice graphics.".
---
Are your combat legs repaired all the way? Dmg resist will top off if they are fully repaired. 
---
Had the same feeling as well. Also check your inventory, or go back and check the silos, there is one more holotape you get when you launch a nuke &gt;!Where the overseer scolds you for using them and basically says your doing the same thing that got everyone else killed!&lt;
---
That's what I figured but kept getting attacked by so many creatures that I had to escape. 
---
If someone has a dedicated pvp character I have no chance, but I like to plan in pa
---
Thank you. I am on PS4

When I used to go to Berkeley to pick up the static spawn handmade rifle (long before the plane could be bought) I decided to try picking up all the shotguns and assault rifles off the enemies while I was there that I had already unlocked everything possible on and then making the handmade the 3rd or 4th gun I scrapped in case anyone had programmed the game to just give you a mod in that way (total speculation) anyway it does help although it does not guarantee a mod so grab every pipe pistol or anything else you know all the mods for and scrap 3 or 4 before scrapping the weapon you want to learn mods for, it certainly can’t hurt and you’ll have a ton of crafting materials, as far as the workbench goes I don’t know if it makes a difference or not
---
I remember seeing one on on a lightpole base when I first came out in the Beta, I'll have to take a look.  I was thinking of just camping outside of the vault, waiting for a new dude to come out, and trading him a protective vault suit for for it.
---
Oh. True and that would stink!
---
PS4
---
Bath robe and a top hat, please tell me you've got a monocle and we wear exactly same stuff xD
---
Great store, gave me a great deal on a handmade rifle :) 
---
Bethesda needs to also make sure all existing weapons drop with legendary variants. Ski swords, war drums, death tambos, gatling plasma, and other new items don't seem to drop in legendary (or if they do, man, are they rare). Increasing legendary drops to includes these weapons would up the variety quite a bit.
---
I've run across people that wanted to build or take part in murder church/player oven and they just wanted to kill, loot and tea bag people. I had partied with strangers a couple times that were interested and ended up leaving the party because they were just assholes to people and haven't done it since. It's only a fun experience if you can make it worth their while with a laugh or some loot IMO. At the very least don't take their junk. I spent an afternoon watching "trap base" videos on Youtube to see what else was out there and that was one of the reasons most of them weren't very good, it was just malevolence. Aside from that they lacked style and were just about the killing. I mean, I'm *also* trying to kill people but I like to think I do it at least artistically.
---
I personally love the game but I want to give you a deeper feel for the game. 
---
It depends on what you enjoyed most about 4. Did you play survival? There is more to consider moment to moment in game. Sure being encumbered doesn't break your legs but the limited stash means you have to be smart about what you scavenge. 
---
Staying with the stash limits, you can't be a collector which is a shame because everything in 4 AND the dlc's except for Nuka World armor, are in here AND MORE. And then the 3 star legendaries add even more variety (actually a lot of legendary affects did not make it over)
---
As you know there are limited npc's and none of them are human so if the characters appealed to you, there aren't as many here. 
---
Story wise it's not a standard fallout one. It does what it needs to do, move you from location to location. It needs to leave room for future dlc's to build upon it so it's scope is limited. 
---
If you're a lore junkie, it does break established lore in multiple ways but it has one of it's own for you to find. 
---
But I refute those who say there isn't a lot to do. Almost all locations have repeatable activities to do, many have multiple as well as randomly placed events and some one off side objectives. 
---
Basic enemy spawns are predictable but most enemy types are randomized. Last time you were there, you had ghouls charge you, this time you have supermutants flanking. 
---
But yes there are issues, they haven't halted my enjoyment but I can't guarantee it won't halt yours. 
---
(Ps4, ~500hrs, 4 characters, level 160 combined)
---
Just saw this my bad. I still have it if you want it. 1.25k?
---
&gt; And I dont need 25 internet randoms per day explaining me why I shouldn’t have fun and why I shouldn’t be playing anymore. 
---
Fucking this. I honestly sometimes its people who hate the game so much it bothers that other people like it still. It's just annoying at this point.
---
Glad to see someone gets it and can think about all the other angles that might be involved.... He could be disabled and elderly and with no income, it's easy to preach from the pulpit when you're not in the trenches.
---
It depends how many you have. And 20 to 50 caps a piece
---
This game will never be completely bug free, I don’t believe any game is, or ever will be, every game I have ever played (as far back as the PS1) has always had a bug or bugs, but at the end of the day you either like a game enough to play around the bugs or you don’t. I’m a “glass half full” kind of person so I like to look for the good things and there’s plenty that keeps me interested and coming back for more in spite of any bug frustrations. I’m sorry your not having fun with it.
---
And I do believe, my good sir, that you have achieved what you set out to do. Those were the most artistically creative murders I've seen since Pickman himself, or even since the Milton Parking Garage in FO4! Lol cant wait to see the next one. 
---
I've never seen a 4th, where is it? One in the middle of the zone and two up above the wall are all I know for?
---
Haha, what was your gamertag? I probably video'd it if you went inside but I might also have server hopped away if I was afraid you'd kill my deathclaw :p
---
I have found that if the weapon/armor is modded you have a higher chance of unlocking a mod
---
&gt; I know I'm beating a dead horse  
---
Then stop please. You haven't brought up anything that's helpful for bug reporting, you haven't said anything that hasn't been said at least once a day for three months. Bethesda Knows about all of your issues, and its obviously not enjoyable for people to read about them.
---
Apparently there's a new strategy to make it harder for people to cap farm you. If you plan on holding it for a while, max out the budget with cardboard standees. This will make it expensive for them to try to claim and they may think it's not even worth it
---
I mean IDK if it will be soon, but there's a ton of money to be made for them if they do. How much money are you willing to spend on your character? maybe a little. How much money for the best boi in the whole goddamn world who you would literally kill every other vault dweller to save? I figure its more.
---
Personally, I think prime weapons are kind of a joke at the moment. The resource cost (fluxes) needed to make ultracite ammo is fairly high for the amount of rounds you get. Even with Super Duper and the ammo crafting perk the amount of rounds you get is painfully low. You'll burn through the ammo far too fast for it to be of real benefit, and then your gun will be useless.
---
You're better off just making extra regular ammo, using the 200% weapon repair health perk card, and just laying down more damage in general. 
---
If you're looking for additional damage to Scorched you're better off with a Zealot's version of a weapon at the current time.
---
So are we :) 
---
Stop inviting to teams or monitor it. Don't invite people to teams you don't trust imo. Had that idea since day 1
---
Oh and people are correct that there are perks to reduce weapon wear and tear. Gunsmith replaces gun nut but also each rank increases durability and weapon artisan allows you to craft and repair them up to 200%. 
---
But that leads to the strategic card system. I have gunsmith active all the time but melee counterpart Makeshift Warrior I have 2 cards, level 5 for modding and crafting but a level one active in combat because I don't have enough intelligence points to have both, fully ranked, active at all times. 
---
And that's another thing you'll have to contend with as you can't have all specials maxed and all cards active at once. I like the system, it should lead to people specializing, and it does but since most people try to be a Jack of all trades, nobody really specializes for a group dynamic. 
---
I usally don't but all my friends just don't play anymore so I've been accepting invites and trying to make friends to do vaults and other high end quests with.
---
OP said he played on xbox.  There are rules regarding messaging and he broke them clearly.  This is all on OP.  Assuming the story given is true.  
---
Bad reputation? WTF are you even talking about this is the most loved game on the planet.
---
Try using lfg stuff then like discord or other forum sites (maybe here but idk about Reddit). Because usually trolls don't take the time to put themselves on LFGs and want to go for the easier target and just get invited to group.
---
I play exclusively solo. Mostly because only one other person in my very small group of friends has a PS4 and they don’t have the game. 
---
I'm playing siege at the moment and a player kept trying to kick my team I'm playing with. Kid legit sounds barely 10 if even.
---
Not sure if the scrapping magazine works or not but I read it, then scrapped 3 radium rifles and learned 2 mods.
---
Probably just coincidence.
---
YOU CAN TAME DEATHAWS? THATS IT GETTING ME WALLET
---
YOU CAN TAME DEATHCLAWS? THATS IT GETTING ME WALLET
---
Which "couple farms" have them?
---
That's epic! Why is the deathclaw attacking players when they are not hostile to you?
---
I'd like to see a lever action shotgun
---
I want(no, demand) to see the entirety of the Fallout universe arsenal implemented, everything from Fallout 1,2, and Vegas(Especially with Gun Runners Arsenal).  This is their "biggest game yet", right?  Let's just forget 3 &amp; 4 because c'mon, they were cookie cutter trash, embarrassingly so.  I focus on ballistics because I just never gave a shit about energy weapons.  A lot of these guns have similar stats, but thats part of the fun, and gun lovers would dig it.   
---
Some examples but plenty more I'm sure.

---
\-PKM
---
\-Browning HP  
---
\-1911  
---
\-Barrett 50  
---
\-Ruger MkIII suppressed.
---
Is this related to why I freeze up in Charlestown and the surrounding areas? I tried a few fixes and still nothing works. 
---
True, but being an asshole on the internet to get people who are breaking the rules banned really isn't as long as you're following the ToS yourself
---
Could be possible. After the update I started to get a lot of stuttering in interior cells as well.
---
Anybody else found dead snoopy and woodstock yet?
---
The rating for the game has nothing to do with the external messaging system. You seriously need to watch what you say there, because you are basically handing people you piss off evidence to get you in trouble. Had you said the same exact thing in game voice chat there would be no log, no suspension, and it might even have ended with the little kid being removed from the game by their parent. 
---
If you haven't already noticed the childish emotes and cosmetics, the game developers are catering towards children. I really wish they weren't, but that is an undeniable fact. 
---
No. Where's that? Assuming on a dog house
---
This is such a bad bot in such an unrelated place, what is even going on here?
---
Most kid I know don't know the difference between 30 FPS and 60 FPS, as long as the game isn't jumpy or laggy they don't care...
---
Good point. I should just drink a Nuka Cola and relax.
---
Don’t take an invite while your at your camp, some people will see your dot in the middle of nowhere not near any landmarks and guess your at your camp and send an invite, no good will come of this, only take invites if your at a landmark or at a quest location, trust no-one lol
---
This is so funny, love your work. Keep 'em coming. 
---
Shouldn't be your graphics card, I'm running a 1070 and full screen on a 3440x1280? Monitor with no problems.. If you've reduced game settings and resolution and still having issues I would start looking at your operating system and apps / drivers that might be eating up resources, especially with an older processor and only 8gb ram. Also if it's been a while since you've blown out and reloaded your system that can also cause you not to get the performance you should be, especially if you do a fair amount of software installs/uninstalls since most uninstalls leave leftovers and aren't even close to clean. 
---
It does run worse than comparable games for me, though it's not terrible (i5 6600k and 1070 w/16gb ram here). I think it's maybe just a creaky old engine. I had the same in 2015 when FO4 ran worse than witcher 3 on similar settings.    
---
If your deathclaw attacks a player, does that make you hostile to the player as well?
---
Console VRAM bottleneck
---
Duplicated 
---
I shoot the prize-bot before he reminds me that I owe him thousands upon thousands of dollars.
---
Just delete it. You get the mats for whatever they built. It's possible they could have been trying to help. 
---
What is dead may never die!
---
Their already is dog cosmetics for some reason I have a dog helmet that is in with my other armor and clothing but I can't equip it.
---
Did you try this?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af9qav
---
On the trade discord, we have a guy who only crafts ammo when he plays. He also has a mule account. He's crafted over 100000 rounds of shotgun shells and 5.56. You don't get banned for crafting
---
Yea I've gotten the dog helmet as well, but its hard to tell exactly why its there. I got the feeling its just a leftover from fallout 4 and was left on the loot lists.
---
But some players have been jumping to my camp from wherever I am.
---
Is there an option like passive mode to stop anyone building that I've not found yet or am I just going to email alone forever? Lol 
---
This is the Evilest thing I've ever seen and I LOVE IT! Great job 👍
---
Well I think it's about time they put then to use. Saves me building my camp where a friendly dog spawns so I have a friendly companion in my camp.
---
I'm about 90% sure it gives a damage boost as well. I'm able to two shot head shot super mutants. The first shot does about 40-45% of their health, the second kills them. So it's doing greater than half their health on the second shot.
---
Nope. It functions strangely. It operates on slap damage but doesn't count as an attack by the player and if they attack it the damage isn't counted as an attack against me. If we attack each other it will start doing full damage though.
---
Top notch stuff.
---
rant srry but relevant, unsupervised kids online is one of my pet peeves 
---
its not on fallout 76, its on the attitude towards gaming, the rise in online shopping and advertising,  the kids that play the age rated games are the ones who can get whatever games they want and play without supervision, the games are popularised through adverts and social media, adverts at the start of YouTube videos, social media influencers' promote and play them etc, apart from fortnite when do you ever see a non adult audience directed game in an advert? i don't
---
age rated games are easier to buy when underage, you used to have the person at the counter saying no you cant buy that, you are too old, now you have a drop-down menu that lets you buy age rated games because you were born in 01/01/1901,same goes for making Xbox accounts at the like, kids have the option to make a child account, why do that when you can make an adult account and have no parental guidelines or supervision all you have to do is press the buttons that say you are 18 that requires no proof of age, just simple maths
---
the parents/guardians  are also at fault for not supervision or regulating the child's time on online video games, why look after the child when the games console can? then using the "i don't understand the internet" excuse when it comes to being quizzed about matters arising between their child and people online despite that generation being the generation who grew up as the internet was being developed and implemented worldwide. when i was younger i always had my parents on my shoulder asking what i was doing/who i was talking to until i was responsible enough to know how the internet and people online work, this continues with my younger siblings/relations being questioned about what they do online
---
its not one group at fault, it is a combination of lots of different people
---
Yup. That's what I tried. I still freeze. No change at all. 
---
Maybe build a storage room and fill it with lights or whatever to max out budget.  Scrap the items when you need budget back.
---
From what I remember hearing (I think it was from Oxford) there is no key yet and people who have PA gliched inside say it's basically empty.
---
I have the marine torso plan if your interested for the right price of course
---
This. And bring back the Robot building mechanics from FO4.
---
It hasn't improved a lot except fixing many bugs. The design of the game is still horrible and can only be fixed by major updates that will come in the next couple of months. That's whenwe can say it improved.
---
I want a yippy chihuahua just annoy the fuck out of people.
---
Will pay 2000 atoms for dog punting emote
---
I thought that at first but the real problem is when they just build a wall with lights, I don't even get copper back from it lol
---
I didn't look for paint jobs. Thanks. 
---
Have hundreds of hours on a Pc, only griefed twice (neither were successful.. One underestimated my build and I killed him twice before hopping and the 2nd was a team that couldn't get me to take the bait while selling at the enclave), overall found most people either helpful or at least neutral. I agree that I think there is a lot more griefing on consoles, largely because of having more kids / teens than pc's.. I'm older and in talking to other people on the pc even I'm surprised at the number of people in over 35-40 in the game. 
---
I’d love my anti material rifle back. Gradually introducing previous weapons is a great idea, it would give the game more depth and variety whilst remaining true to lore.
---
Your build plays into it a little as well. 
---
Oh wait. Sorry thought this was a diffrent post I made. Your price and 5
---
Just look into who you link up with. Put out a post or look for another person to play with and build some trust with. 
---
And this is why I can’t always be mad at myself for trusting other people 
---
I say this everyday
---
That’s probably the best way to combat high level buttholes who’ve maxed out their traits! 
---
turn on pacifist mode? you do no damage to other players, so you don’t give them the satisfaction of starting a fight.
---
The valley south of flats woods is pretty good. Open flat land. Closer to Charleston there’s a small pond. A random encounter spot and a vendor. 
---
The mountain north of the whitespring is a good view. No water but your seconds all the things you’d need.  
---
Ohhh.. all that Ultracite, did you grab it all ? lol
---
I think it’s just programming. A lot of gulpers do that especially when they have friends. 
---
Saw you drop it but had to go to bed, how did it turn out ?, think i counted over 12 players, usually dosent end well with that amount, lol
---
It normally drop the mask after you getbtooo far from the school. 
---
You're not wrong but I feel some credit is do for the QOL changes. I think they should have launched with those  changes but I don't think the games base design is that flawed. 
---
Besides the lack of NPCS it plays like a basic fallout game in survival mode. 
---
I'm sorry you aren't having fun with it? How much have you played? 
---
Nope. It was with me. All 5.
---
Man this makes me wish you could name tameables. Fluffy the deathclaw would be great.
---
I noticed that recently. I had hoarded a shit ton of liquor and beer because I'd become an alcoholic but couldn't find addictol (I didn't want the addiction). I finally closed down for the night and when I loaded up the next day, all my booze was useless. Addiction was gone. 
---
Those high level players are likely at 25k or close to it on caps anyway.  They're just bored.  What we really need is more end game content than just running from event to event to try and get new loot.
---
You own the game so you'll give them their game back so you can get a dog companion? 
---
Seems like a fair trade.
---
I'm level 76 and I had some fun with it. The quests, the lore is pretty nice to uncover and puzzle together. It's just the rest of the game like the grinding or the bad endgame that really puts me off. I'm hoping Bethesda fixes a lot of it through their DLCs and adds some new content.
---
I got one of these about a week after release, I still have it since I thought it was funny to keep since there's no dogs companions 
---
Ok normally I don't like your traps as they kill the players. But I love this one. Nice use of a deathclaw. And yeah Hope more features are added to tamed animals.... Hell I would pay caps to go through a true maze with a deathclaw. 
---
Ha that is exactly what i needed. Better than going to the main menu again and again
---
I totally agree . I'm at a point now where I have to grind for a while for my food and ammo and adhesive and shit before I can go to anything substantial. I think an half a year or so it may be a different game. Hoping so anyways
---
Dead meme, you’re acting like a total scum-bro. OP has a good point, I met more assholes on 76 the first month than I have the whole time I’ve been playing this game. There wasn’t much scamming going on, I’ve gotten over 300+ hours from this game, better than most of the “1 &amp; done” titles coming out imo, but to each his own, right? 
---
Don’t know why you act like a messiah on the internet and speak for a community that has fun with a game deemed, “broken”. You’re a douche, plain and simple &lt;3
---
The lack of any sort of end game is what really sticks out to me as someone who has run out of things to do other than bounce around from event to event. 
---
I’ve been playing solo since launch.  I’ve never teamed up or even traded with another player.  If my friends played on PC it’d be a different story, but I’m more than happy with the solo experience.
---
Look for what I call "marsh" icons, they are lakes and ponds with flat lands, trees and bushes and the occassional critters for cooking.

Mein C.A.M.P.F
---
I like how you left the tl;dr empty lol
---
And that's your opinion as well. Nothing wrong with it. 
---
My point is simply that the way Perk Cards were implemented and how the system was designed heavily implies that monitization was a key component here. Which is NOT an insane conspiracy theory as this is a live service game and was always intended to be one. Meaning that it would require a constant flow of revenue beyond launch in order to keep it's servers running and to keep a team employed to patch the game and design "free" dlc/expansions. 
---
Right now, the only revenue stream besides initial sales is the Atom Shop and I can't see that being a big enough and consistent enough source of revenue to help pay to keep the servers running. 
---
Though this does raise a big question. If they are not monetizing gameplay, how are they going to afford to keep the game running beyond the first year? Are enough people paying $20 for a power armor skin to afford it? 
---
When you think you give this game another try after some weeks... you log on, another player logs on directly near you and instantly kills you for your 30 caps you don't even know where you got them from.... this game definitely was a money wasting for me... I don't have any motivation left to play it. I liked F4 a lot better and now maybe I play a little skyrim and fallout shelter again.. I could not even ask people for help in a "chat" this game lacks basic necessary mmo things (like chat, battleground etc.)... just annoying -.-
---
You dont have anything constructive in this post.  You were overencumbered and slow, you died in pvp, and ghouls were killing you.  
---
Try to drop useless heavy items, play pacified, and take rad x and use vats in a ghoul fight.
---
South west of the lighthouse is a red dog house with a skeleton laying on it snoopy style and a birdhouse nearby.
---
Ill post some pictures when i get home for Karma.
---
Let's set aside the fact that the low health melee build can be one shotted just as easily as they can one shot sombody. We'll go through what it takes to get that BIG DAMAGE screenshot. 
---
Two mutations... twisted muscles and adrenal reaction. 
---
Legendary gear... Unyielding armor, full set. Bloodied weapon, modified. 
---
Perks... bloody mess, adrenaline , nerd rage, tenderizer, radicool, sunkissed, gladiator/slugger, probably one or two others I'm forgetting.
---
Consumables.... magazines, bobble heads, whiskey, psychobuff, food, drinks, ect.
---
Which of these makes the low health melee build unbalanced and what do you change that won't affect other builds? Take away the damage bonus from strength? You just wrecked all other melee builds that are not out of balance. 
---
So what do you think the problem is, or the solution?
---
Hmm. I've seen quite a few of those lately.
---
I’m sure insulting him and calling him scum will change his mind and bring him round to your opinion. Bravo.
---
I just want Irradiated effect from FO4 back!
---
I wouldn’t want to play with you if you have this attitude to those who disagree.
---
&gt; but a Bobby pin from my buddy for 20k 
---
Hey it's me!  Your buddy...
---
For some reason I have the need to stalk his entire post history.
---
You didn't lose everything.  You lost some junk and gained some knowledge. 
---
How in the hell would that be a negative?  Pop screws would be a blessing to em in this game.
---
Thanks for the link! 
---
We must had be on same server same shit happen to me yesterday 
---
I am a little scared of dogs but i would love a cat companion 
---
are you being constructive when you drop in with a smug strawman version of my post to give answers for? pacifist doesn't have anything to do with the turret glitch, what a weak stretch lol
---
Same... Unyielding Shrouded wood is great.  Super lightweight and perfect for crafting weapons/armor at 200% CND and for sharing perks like weapon artisan or fix it good.
---
Stop watching Juicehead
---
That's what I was thinking.  Here we have someone claiming to be an adult and yet was bullied by a 10 year old.  Kudos to the 10 year old!  Someone takes your workshop and you don't let up trying to take it back despite the fact that they are higher level than you.
---
Mad to think it's nobut this happened to myself on a new character just now. Still experimenting trying to fix :(
---
Look man.  It's either you want to talk about negatives so Bethesda sees them or you want to complain incessantly.  You clearly prefer the latter and that's fine but dont get all whiny that people dont like your post because useless. 
---
The game is great. It seems most people are upset because its too hard to acquire top tier weapons and armor. Everyone wants to be a meta toon,grinding all day everyday. and i find that, thats what takes the fun out of the game. Just play it, and dont worry about being super OP. Youll get there eventually 
---
Saw a life preserver on a ship this weekend, first thought was “fuck yeah, plastic!”
---
Somewhere out there, there is a entitled parent that's going to say "It's just a game... You should have let my kid have the claim..."
---
Hm .... so glad i play on PC then .... fuck such rules.
---
Nope i Am just using in game mechanics to get rich quick
---
Its in game for some reason
---
If you thought I wasn't making sense you wouldn't be trying so hard to rephrase what I said lmao
---
Bunch of butt-hurt people down-voting you it seems.  Your words are true though!
---
So people pay for a service that they can get suspended from using by using swears ...
---
Wow...
---
I dont think you've fully thought through the limitations that more permanent servers and camps would bring about.  We already have limited stash space...  it's hard enough to rebuild let alone doing so everytime I log in.  Also in a full server how do I invite friends?  We go to another permanent server that's somehow empty?  I think you need them as they are...
---
Hello it's me, Bethesda.
---
/s
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Kid started attacking me whilst I’m stood at the vendor sell stuff, after a minute or two of constantly be hit with a sledgehammer I get annoyed with it and kill them. Then kid runs back, gets killed, runs in, gets killed, runs in, gets killed... this is so frustrating, if you want to play COD, piss off and play COD kid.

Reinstalled Fallout 76 after taking a month off.  Saw someone launch a nuke at fissure site prime.. Figured I'd check it out see what drops from queen.  30 minutes later ammo spent one melee weapon broken and she flying off the edge of the map never to be seen again.  Yeah it just works 💪 great game if you just wanna wander the map with a melee weapon doing these little shit events.  Other then that, total mess.  My explosive combat rifle went from 200 plus DMG to 89 lmao never got lucky with a 2SE weapon but I loved my explosive combat rifle.  So much for that guess you have to go blooded or nothing now in this game.  
---
YES.
---
Yeah do it. Then I can finally go around hunting players dogs
---
I like Piper ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Honestly, I was super critical of the end game and hated it. But player trading has changed that for me entirely. It feels so good to trade for legendary items and run businesses. Sure I wish there was something to do with these legendaries, but right now trading and making builds is super fun to me 
---
You're still missing a simple concept. Incredible. Real time day night cycles as in no accelerated ingame time. Local time means nothing for this to work.  
---
Why go ahead, give me a objective opinion. What's fantastic about a mmo with:
---
Bugs. A lot of them.
---
Infrequent fixes (the plan was "weekly patches" before the sales were over)
---
No Balance (ever seen anyone play daggers or pistols? Might've seen me before i deleted the whole fucking character)
---
No pve content aside from open world grind
---
No pvp content aside from open world ganking
---
And don't you say that you just enjoy circle-jerking with all the other hardcore fanboys cause that's quite well known allready even outside of this reddit.
---
I think now is the best time to jump in. The game performs better at least for me. I don't really get a lot of disconnects anymore.
---
Also they're about to drop a bunch of DLC and the next couple days. And throughout the next of the year.
---
Most of the people complaining about having nothing to do but have been playing since beta. And granted I guess I can understand how it did grow stale. But there is a lot coming up here soon. I vote to buy it.
---
I mean, is it really griefing if it costs them way more resources to build all that stuff than it costs you? 😋
---
But yeah, what it really comes down to is don't team up with players you don't know.
---
Two things! The Dog must be Unkillable!!!
---
No Exceptions!!!
---
Dog skins for different breeds - if I can have a Boston Terrier in the Wasteland my life would be complete:)
---
Ah, that makes a lot of sense.
---
How do you tame a creature
---
God, the cackling on the video was irritating.
---
Dogs should be killable if they can attack other players and creatures uppn death the dog just drops the junk items in it’s inventory and respawns near the player or at camp
---
Do you have enough material?  Someone on the server might of had it for a while and used up all the resources and then got off before you took it.
---
I love Harpers ferry and will never move :)             https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/ai101c/my_unique_camp_build_with_trap_dont_mind_the/
---
Though I have sympathy for your Queen experience I must ask, how did you only use 400 shotgun shells...I go through thousands of .45 and 5.56 when I do a Queen run and I also bring a melee with me just so I don’t put to much strain on my main rifles. 
---
I've gotten addicted only once in 250 hours in the first place, it's not like Junkie's builds need any help to be even more terrible.
---
I just started, and wish I could group more often just to get my do bonus and damage reduction from the Charisma cards.  I sometimes just throw out random invites, but rarely get any takers on PS4.
---
Outstanding! Keep up the good work!
---
I captured a couple of workshops, and people have seemed to ignore it all the time i might just be lucky
---
I don’t want to actually team up at this stage of the game, just share some benefits while we go our own ways.
---
My psn is my username.  I'm level 70. I can show you the wooooooorld.
---
I play with no mic and don't miss it since I play more like SP.  If you could permanently mute all players, then I'd say this game probably would be fine for kids.  Not sure if this is an option or not.
---
Personal experience and 200+ level, NO.  The reason though is not actually an RNG thing alone.  Let’s say you have a full perk card, Gunsmith for example.  You CANNOT rank another card up to full rank.  So the highest you can do is 4/5 on the animated and 5/5 non-animated.  The only way you could would be if you don’t level anything up to max level and only leveled animated to max rank.  I am hoping they add a delete feature or breakdown to the cards.  I’ve had bandolier unable to be ranked because of this and it’s only 2 ranks :(
---
Oh wow! Thanks for the heads up, I’ll send that to the team as well. Glad it’s up and working for you now! :)
---
I'm not a PVPer myself but imo the bounty reward should start from lvl range up to max lvl (50 caps)
---
Example : 
---
Lv 1-10 wanted = 10 caps base reward
---
Lv 11-20 wanted = 20 caps base reward
---
Lv 21-30 wanted = 30 caps base reward
---
Lv 31-40 wanted = 40 caps base reward
---
Lv 41-50+ wanted = 50 caps base reward (this way people who are above lvl 50 can still do PVP without losing a lot of caps because of their level) because I dont think Lv 500+ wants to pvp and risk it for losing 500 caps each time they die.
---
Destroying stuffs in CAMP will add the bounty by 10 caps each.
---
And then if you kill someone, add that bounty with the person's level you just killed capped at lv 50 (if you killed a lv 200+ it still capped at 50). For example you're a lv 37 killing a lv 21, your bounty will be 40 caps + 21 caps = 61 caps wanted bounty. 
---
But this isn't enough because we can ask our friend to kill us to clear our bounty and give back the bounty reward. To prevent this situation there should be an addition 20% to the bounty loss.
---
Example : a max lvl killing another max lvl = 50 caps (your lvl; base reward) + 50 caps (the person you just killed) =100 caps reward to anyone who can kill you and claim the bounty, but you will lose an additional 20% = 120 caps loss if you get killed. This way you still lose caps even if you asked your friend to kill you to claim your bounty and give you back the caps.
---
If you're trying to empty your caps before PVPing, you can still go bankrupt, your caps can go negative.
---
If you don't want to lose the additional 20% bounty loss, there should be a responder or west virginia police department bot for you to pay the bounty.
---
After doing a sbq battle with and without prime recievers on the same gun, it's pretty clear prime recievers work significantly better against her and the scorched enemies. It's the strongest receiver for any gun( brought my bloodied Gatling gun up like 70 damage a shot and that's not including the 30 or 50% damage increase to sb and sbq) it kind of sucks you only get guaranteed prime receivers from sbq(yes they drop randomly from regular sb) but best bet against her is to prime receivers what ever ur strongest weapon is and what ur build is gear toward.
---
Good thing I paid for one. 
---
I agree! But my recommendation it to come at it casually. Don't try to power level or speed run. Take your time and explore the world. This game is not a race, it's not a marathon, it's a long slow walk down a 🎶*COUNTRY ROAD*🎶
---
I managed to get an enameled metal chest piece that has the best damage resistance ive seen, so much so i use it over legendary chest pieces
---
Yeah, I wanted to be a tank too, but you're right. The game has no real dfifference between players, except weapon choice. I'd say melee would be the best way to hold aggro, being close up and all, except that it's too easy to kill things in 1-2 hits with the right weapon, so not much point.
---
Private servers and mods are coming, they said they're targeting the end of 2019 but that was subject to change based on other factors. 
---
As for offline play? They've never indicated plans for this, and in fact said the opposite:
---
https://twitter.com/DCDeacon/status/1034123132284624896
---
You'll be able to play on private servers but they're still controlled/hosted/managed by Bethesda.
---
You and me both! How about plasm infused? Why remove it? Wait a minute, I figured it out, they had too many problems with unlootable goo piles. 😆
---
Shotgun has a much slower fate of fire than a 5.56 guns and .45 ( combat rifle, radium rifle)
---
How does the trading work? I haven't played in over a month or so and just started again. I haven't seen any sort of trading yet. 
---
That's such a shame, it could be doable if you never ranked the perk cards up to their highest level, however that would gimp a lot of your damage. I agree I do hope they add a system in that allows us to downgrade perk cards so we can eventually animate them all. 
---
And yet a lot of people, myself included are still having plenty of fun playing the game and exploring what I personally think is one of the best open worlds I have seen with tons of places to explore. I almost stopped playing after the TSE/TS nerf because I play a rifle build but instead of giving up I just changed my character a little, I was a high enough level that I had plenty of level up pointed that I didn’t use so it was very easy for me to respec certain things and I’ve been actually having more fun since I did that.  
---
Baxter, is that you? Baxter! Bark twice if you’re in Milwaukee.
---
I totally agree I didn’t find the Whitespring until high lev 30 and if you play slow and steady it makes some location just stunning and amazing to “ find” so don’t look at the map just wonder where the game takes you you’ll shocked at what you find 
---
It must be very low.  I've never come across them and I'll killed plenty of Scorchbeasts...
---
Doesn’t a few holotapes curse?
---
I’m not aware of a way to stop them building but this might be something Bethesda looks at if enough people highlight it, especially if the upcoming ability to decorate camps with stash items means you could basically fill someone’s camp with toilet rolls you’ve been collecting and hoarding or the suchlike lol
---
To all of you down voting me for doubting OP. Here's why I do.  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aw9z88/psa_slap_damage_results_of_an_extensive_although/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
I understand that, but 400 still doesn’t seem like much at all. I get the player could have been switching between melee and shotgun or other weapons. All I’m saying is it is very easy to craft 400 or more shotgun shells in no time at all, it’s not really a huge loss in the grand scheme of things. 
---
Fapping.
---
Sounds like the oncle who works for nintendo...
---
On a serious note though, the original dude OP's tried to replicate didn't get insta-banned eather. I hope your pal won't be banned in the future.
---
Dude so what? He didn't even harass you, he literally was just playing the game to get his workshop back
---
He's been doing it since 900 hours guy got his ban, but his isn't Ultracite. I can give you a link if you want?
---
Everything I've read said it doesn't. I was using tank killer for a while with my tesla rifle. I assumed it was working, because the enemies would stagger, but I never saw any noticeably easier kills. So I am assuming I was only getting the secondary effect. Honestly, it's a bullshit effect to be allowed on a weapon if it doesn't work as intended, but many things don't in this game... unfortunately.
---
I run plague walker and this has never happened. Has it happened to you, or are you just assuming it works that way and stating it as fact? https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aw9z88/psa_slap_damage_results_of_an_extensive_although/?utm_source=reddit-android

First usually when I see an invite it's because someone wants to fast traveling to a location. But I have never had anything like this happen. Why not keep your budget maxed all the time this what my friend does? We he had a certain friend who  used to hide cat pictures around his camp. I don't really get what you are saying about leaving room for updates?

Is there any difference in their effects or is it just for aesthetic?

This is the pic he sent me Feb 25th, his second day of crafting shells

It's basically become more stable.
---
Which isn't to say that crashes, disconnects, or odd behavior are impossible, but you see a *lot* less of them now than you did even a month ago.
---
I appreciate you
---
Yep it seems the more mods are in a gun the higher chance you have of getting some. Also when I craft a gun to scrap I usually get a mod.
---
I found this early on and decided to RP my character as carrying on the sickleman legacy. I have a beautiful camp at Whitesprings that I leave open to everyone to use--until I lock the doors on them and [put on my mask.](https://imgur.com/a/FzzQkQK)

Did you kill her man after pick up the last one ?
---
Lots of bug fixes and improved stability.
---
Lol yeah we gave it a shot and we actually were able to take her down. Went through 5,000 50 cal rounds each  haha the server was crap tho and i got kicked for the loot part. Bummer 
---
I know what you mean, it souds pretty funny to us outsiders but ive been killed from people abusing the in game systems befire and its just plain irritating, best bet is to just log a ticket to bethesda becuase if you didnt do anything but got a bounty ect... It sounds like a bug that needs fixing

That's why I said to copy past from fallout 4. Dog-meat and other companions are labeled essential, and i assume it would have to be this way in fallout 76 as well, so yea you might be able to slap damage a dog, but it should never be able to die in any way.
---
Look at it this way. You get some resources when you scrape the stuff they place and it isn't costing you anything when they place it but a little bit of time. I have a friend who regularly writes penis all over my camp  in small letters and its annoying as hell to scrap them 
---
Prime receivers are for scorched earth events only. Not for everyday use. Take your biggest baddest gun that you already use on the queen and make that prime, you won't be disappointed. 
---
Your sure you can drop these it's weird cause it doesn't go into a bad or anything just goes straight in the ground.

Lmao
---
That's some great stuff there.
---
Im dying over here laughing.
---
Sorry if I come off as hostile, I'm just really committed to stomping out rumors and I'm kinda baked and hopped up on coffee
---
Please elaborate a bit more?
---
Even if he was an adult, you still would have broken TOS, so you would still get banned if reported. Not sure how those things are related.
---
No, but i want it to be able to die !
---
Man, I had the buggiest SBQ run last night too.  The warning signs were there from the start.  I got into my Power Armor and got the stretched-out body glitch.  That should be have been a sign.
---
At some point, I realized the Queen just wasn't going to die.  The rate of health depletion over time just wasn't where it needed to be.  And I also had no Action Points.  You know how the game sometimes lags in adding of subtracting from your AP?  Mine was depleted and it simply wasn't coming back.
---
So, I decided to get out of my Power Armor.  And now I was pseudo-overencumbered.  My weight was something like 350/280, and yet I had no overencumbered icon and could still fast travel.  Why?  Because the game returned all the individual parts of my Power Armor, but *not the Power Armor Chassis*.
---
This goes on for several precious minutes until finally, "Power Armor has been recalled to your inventory" pops in from out of nowhere.  Great.  I get back in my PA and do what I can.  Scorched Earth fails, but the SBQ is *still* there attacking everyone.  But eventually, other players start bugging out, so I do too.  I head back to Watoga Station, get out of my Power Armor and... *not this again*.
---
It took *ten minutes* for the Power Armor Chassis to get recalled.  Seriously.
---
My teammate somehow lost most of his ammo in this process.  When he logged in again, he found his Shotgun Shells had magically returned, but the 5.56 ammo didn't.
---
Pretty bad.
---
Same as a Barrett 50, this game definitely needs a high power sniper rifle like that.
---
HaHa!
---
The helmet is not available on PS4 sadly. 
---
I admire the amount of work you put into a good prank.  Bonus points for and to the twitch streamers.
---
It’s a weird thing. I always assume the people I run into ingame are adults. I teamed up with a couple of random players a few months ago and run around with them for around half an hour and had no idea they were children until I heard them chat over the mic. They were lovely and polite though. So yeah I suppose some interactions could be frustrating but then I remember it’s a video game and children probably have more right to be playing it than I do lol 
---
After you pick up her last tape at the big mine there is a key card on the table. You have to pick it up and go Into the locked door at the bottom of the stairs. There is a scorched in there that was her X and she didn't have the heart to kill so you have to then the quest ends.
---
A bit east of the hunting lodge up north is a double resource site that contains junk and lead I can't remember the exact area but if you look up double resources Fallout 76 on Youtube it'll be in one of those videos
---
To the discord? Pass. From what i've seen from this community so far i find it more likely that people spread missinformation for then against beth.
---
I mean the mf duping was beth's responsibility and people accepted those half-justified banns to begin with.. ever heard someone getting banned in a game like WoW for stuff other then third-party hacks? I sure didn't. Had nice occasional talks with GM's though where i showed them how to jump rooftops.
---
Ehh guys I think he was sacastic
---
Can you please describe it in a little more detail please 
---
I do not really understood what I should check in my inventory and I launched a nuke yesterday but no holotape afterwards, so please elaborate a bit more. Thank you in advance for all the help. 
---
No I linked you imgur links to his crafting amounts. Did you look at them?
---
You can get 1000 shots per violet flux with a gatling laser. And a prime gatling laser absolutely melts everything sight. Don't be too hasty in writing off prime recievers.

Just keep killing them. Had a pair of people keep hitting the factory while I had it. They used artillery a few times so when they went to there base to resupply I followed them and artillery strikes there base and brought the fight to them till they left the server. 
---
The helmet got into circulation on pc from the developer room, some people claim to have found it from outside thunder mountain powerplant but I've never encountered any player  with it on PS4 so I find it unlikely.
---
I think the best way to pull that off would be that you would only use the companion when you were so soloing. If everyone on the team that would make them too powerful.
---
Also apparently you never went Under Ironforge, people definitely got banned for that
---
Idk?  No big deal.  Just internet points...
---
Just aesthetics
---
on armor it can be on three star legendary armor drops, weapons, ammo, food, meds, junk are usually the options can find i believe. i dont know what system you are on but on ps4 when your in the inventory screen looking at it ya press down on the right stick and it will show ya all the stats on the item. 
---
usually reads like this:
---
sentinel/assassins/unyielding
---
+ to stat/ +rad resist
---
weapon weight reduced by 20%
---
On xbox live*
---
Microsoft has been pretty serious about this stuff for year now, I'm not sure what OP expected when then did this.
---
Just used this today. Thanks
---
There was literally the whole server there
---
I would probably just go with your level 30.  If anything, the levels come faster at higher levels, which is a little odd for an RPG, but i dont think starting over gives a big benefit.  Just spend a little time in the forest (Northeast) to get your bearings.
---
I play every day. Like you I ran out of things to do in fo4. Fo76 is big and fun to explore. The multiplayer does add another dimension, although I tend to play single player and don't interact with other players. The game really needs some form of chat, few people have mics, so communication is tricky. But overall I like it. Don't worry about bugs, all games have them.
---
You are amazing!!
---
That is the biggest oof in the holy history of oofs.
---
1. Yes, weapons break.  Intelligence perks like Gunsmith (slows rate of decay; enables crafting more complex mods) and Weapon Artisan (allows you to "over-repair" weapons to 200% condition) help a lot.
---
2. It shouldn't be.  There are posts here all the time about sales.  Don't pay full price for it.
---
3. Well, I think it is, but YMMV.
---
I agree and believe the dog should be able to take damage. But instead of dropping junk and respawning at camp I would like it if they just sat disabled for a cool down period or until stimpacked like in fo4.
---
r/entitledparents has a lot of them.
---
Pleeeeeaz! But I think some perminance would really help too. Like some up to date copy of a friends camp always gets loaded every time you log in
---
Those fake doors are perfect. 
---
Sorry reddits spam protection...
---
Def not the first ones who did. They fixed that one pretty early (gave it a shot myself). It was appearently only possible with wall hacks after that.
---
The yellow numbers with the black background are kinds suspicious.
---
All the time! It’s usually dark on my way home from work and there’s a house I pass that has a pile of bricks in the front garden but because it’s dark it looks exactly like a pile of wood and I’m like ‘fuck yeah...oh wait’ 
---
Yup. Love browsing through there every once in a while. 
---
This raises another question...
---
If team “mates” can add things to your camp, can they also edit and remove everything you have? Now THAT would be the ultimate griefing. 
---
Yep, cuss words are used, sex is mentioned, the DLC in a few days is based on alcohol, and have you seen the bloody corpses.   
---
This game is not fit for kids. 
---
The only thing my Bostie would attack is someone's face with kisses
---
No really, I want the option to have my puppy have a white/non-hostile/please don't kill me tag
---
Have you tried playing the song of healing?
---
I love joining the Collision Course event with some low levels. I usually have to pick up a pipe weapon off a corpse so I don’t one shot everything, or I play around with a melee weapon (I’m a rifle build).

The personal matters quest line is done and I killed Evan (scorched)

---
Fallout 76 isn’t a hugely demanding game graphically. I doubt this is an issue, especially considering games like ARK are on console.
---
It’s more likely a limitation of the creation engine.
---
Yeah, I was able to build everything else and had plenty of resources... I until the server crashed and lost it all...

I am extremely bored right now. I have been looking at this game weeks I never played fallout before but this one looks alright. Been thinking about buying it but the negative talk makes me afraid. Is this like a survival game? 
---
I nominate you for greatest FO76 player ever,
---
I killed a scorched dog wearing a dog helmet and a bandana in a queen fight pretty recently.   
---
The only other dog helmet I've seen was on a body in the freakshow as part of that real upbeat-feel-good environmental storytelling.   
---
What if, let's say any player has a robot, and sets his robot parts in a priority order like if you have a robot head that's legendary and good enough, you set it first. Then when you go into a team, 1 robot is formed out of the best parts of every player in the team, based on priority.
---
The thing about a roadmap is there are always detours.
---
Someone here in the subreddit gave me advice that if I like playing the game the way I did I should go back to Fallout 4... taking that advice is one of the better decisions I've made... I started at the very beginning and the graphics, gameplay, writing, is so much better.
---
I'll come back to Fallout 76 but it will take you years before it actually "improves".
---
Better than it was but still needs a lot of fixes/revamps imo. 
---
Biggest thing that needs a solid revamp is enemy scaling. They need to be rescaled to the individual player rather than whoever walks into an area first. A level 20 player should never be facing a level 40 or 50 enemy. 
---
He's gonna make a vid to post to reddit, so I'll link it here
---
Ah  max lvl :) 
---
I just wanted to say I love you. This game needs people like you who get creative and realize the potential with building. The player oven was the first thing I saw of yours and it inspired me to get weird and build some workshops. I ended up with one that was an elaborate trap advertising a basement party, "GET THE FUCK IN HERE LOSER" in neon. Left a bunch of enticing things at the end of a locked hallway, stashes and rat poison in bags that looked like loot. The last door was a dead end when you opened it, adorned with "DIE" in neon lettering and "Have you taken your medication today?" posters everywhere. I would lock them in for a bit and then change into ritual garb and whip out a chainsaw for that spicy reveal when I open the door again. Most fun I've had on the game yet and I don't think I actually killed anyone, it was just fun to see their reaction. 
---
Please keep it up, though I don't know how you could top this one!
---
The answer is quite simple, begin a new character ( you don't need to delete the old one ) and if it doesn't feel good or you just don't enjoy it like before you just switch and that's it. Don't overthink it, because it can also work the other way around. Just do what you want do for fun.
---
Got tired of fallout 4 (2khrs lol) and am now back to Skyrim SE.  I've come to the realisation that these are prob the last games we will ever get like this from bethesda.  It's cool I love the modding community to death and they have so much more passion for the game.  Mods are amazing it's crazy to see what they're doing in Skyrim now..  Crazy lol I'm staying on here to keep track of changes.

It’s on apple too. I just got it

You won't be banned for cooking. Unless you cook so much that you have three mules holding hundreds of thousands of wood and boiled water so you can cook even faster. Unless you are trading hundreds of thousands of deathclaw steaks and molerat chunks for hundreds of thousands of corn soups. Unless you are doing all of these things all day every day and have two accounts so you can cook and trade and trade and cook all at the same time.
---
I can't even play. I just bought the game and it crashes when i try to load my character.......
---
The Plasma Gatling Prime is better than the standard plasma gatling and making ultracite plasma cores doesn't cost a lot. They use yellowcake flux and that stuff is plentiful at The Whitespring when nuked.
---
I have been using the .50 cal prime lately. Pretty good, but the ammo is very expensive to make (40 steel to make 180 bullets, then to make them ultracite another 40 steel and violet flux) 
---
I keep hearing this. Not talking about the bags or any of the merch stuff. What have they ever lied about the actual game itself? I keep seeing that people said Bethesda oversold the game and blatantly lied about what it was going to be, but I watched the press conferences. And it’s exactly what they said it would be. A bit buggy. But other than that exactly what they said
---
I had a furious combat knife but I was still picking off all the scorched with only one hit. He kept getting overwhelmed by low level ghouls and scorched and I let them come after me so he could pick them off easily.
---
Your best bet is to just make a new account and start over.

I tried to build mine in the parking lot of the water park... Kept telling me I couldn't build near existing locations and I had to keep moving further away until it let me.
---
That or like other games do if your looking in that direction it should pop up in a corner to tell you which quest it is
---
It's not actually in the workshop, it's on the western/southern side of the golf course.
---
Heh
---
All these people complaining about your post and talking shit to you leaves a bad taste in my mouth for this subreddit. If they don't have anything constructive to say back then they should just downvote and walk away. People are entitled to their opinions, people shouldn't be shitting on you and gatekeeping conversation...
---
That Twitch clip is great. I tuned in to see players go through the maze, they didn’t go through the maze, I’m disappointed, and then realized FO76 is married to disappointment.
---
They are the giant preying mantis looking guys. I usually see them in the SBQ fight in the last couple minutes of the timer counting down.
---
A question I  would have and I am not sure is to whether it can be used in PA. If that is not a concern if your then disregard. But first use in Nuke zones and radiation area not being able to use would be a big detriment. Like MMG and DCG. Just a thought.  Cheers
---
It's base damage is a fair bit lower than the Deathclaw Gauntlet or Power Fist so I'd honestly just go with one of those and take Iron Fist. 
---
I can understand that...
---
My first playthrough in Fallout 4 is over 200 hours... I never completed the game... when it came out I was in a Minecraft phase so I played it like Minecraft. Didnt like it because all my perks were based around settle ment building.
---
Here are the questions I ask friends when they ask if they should get the game.
---
Did you play Fallout 4? If so, when the main story ended, did you keep playing, building up settlements, finishing side quests, exploring for crafting supplies and interesting weapons?
---
If you answered yes then you will likely love FO76. If no, you probably won't be into it.
---
Just bring them to a vendor and go to sell them. It will tell you how much you'll get before you confirm the purchase.
---
Yesssss please. I've been wanting one from day one. I think even if you get in pvp the dogs can just play with each other till you're done or something. I would love to have my doggo back
---
So then every team of high level players has an over the top amazing robot to kill noobs with?
---
I thought it was 3 and 1/2 cm!?!?!   But I belive it comes out on the 19th if your talking about Helvetia 
---
I've seen legendary death tambos and ski swords, but I'm not sure about the others.  They may not drop as often as other weapons, but I've had a decent amount, used a Vampire's Tambo for a long time, and currently, a Blooded Ski Sword is one of my go-to melee weapons.
---
That’s probably why you won’t see it in game.  
---
I think they are talking about how much are they worth to other players.  Some of the outfits are pretty rare.
---
I love my Meathook, and it does insane dmg due to the fact you can stack the perks. To me, it's worth the cost &amp; fun to use. Can't be used with PA but neither can the DC &amp; PF. Make sure to add in the extra hook! 
---
Aren't they already able to kill noobs?
---
Report kids when you see them then.  If we can get suspended for our behavior around kids then they should be able to be suspended for playing games they are not supposed to be playing.

Try the trading forum. Just list what you have and say you are taking offers, don't let anyone low-ball you too hard. If you're not happy with an offer, then haggle. Most people are pretty cool about trading and selling over there. You can also ask for a price check, but may not get an answer
---
We should all aspire to be as cleverly evil as you. I love it. 
---
No like to other players
---
I’m still of the opinion that they should have dogs and automotrons for followers in the game. If they’re worried about balance issues, have them take up a team member slot, so a squad can never go above four total players/companions, or make it to where only the team leader can have one. 
---
Yh thx 
---
Yeah I went through Vanilla first time, no mods. Then modded it like crazy lol I will say that I upgraded my card for F76 and now I can really Mod F4 and SkyrimSE like crazy now lol so that's a good thing that came out of it too :P I loved Fallout 4 gave it a great review on steam bought it for a friend .... didn't like they jacked up the cost of the Season Pass to $50 and yeah I wish we had more Far Harbor like DLC's and better dialog, but other then that great friggin game. 
---
Alright thanks maybe you could check out when I post there and see if anything is worth something
---
Do you mind sharing a bit about your build? I run VATS crit rifle and I feel like I’m doing something wrong after reading your post.
---
I joined the queen fight Friday night on PS4 and she wasn't taking damage like she normally would. We had her down to her last bit of health when the event failed. We run into that all too often :(
---
By your description, you wouldn't happen to have Last Laugh would you? It reads like you may have dropped a grenade on death and that grenade did damage to the camp giving you a bounty.
---
No. It has gone from level 100 sh#t game to level 96 sh#t game. I mean look how fast has the price dropped and it is been over 90 days since launch and game still doesn't have a text chat. If they can't even fix such a simple thing, then there can be no expectation they can fix even bigger problems like whole missing endgame. SBQ is same garbage as ever, PVP is "broken" and more than ever people are leaving. 
---
psn: Silune  
---
currently have a 222 vats sniper, working on a 51 melee, got another lvl 16ish prolly going pistol build eventually.  
---
play 7pm est to about 3am est everyday.  
---
normally just wander around and kill shit, never have to much structure or road map on what i want to do myself. ya welcome to join me anytime ya want. i dont usually go looking for people just hit play and roll with it but i never turn down a party invite from someone coming to find me, or asking for help to kill or do something.. ill gladly throw lead down range when asked. but looking forward to the new events coming and the opening of some of the vaults. 
---
what DLC?...
---
Most definitely, I always seem to go to a rifleman/sniper build in fallout games. My character is pretty sick at the moment... Only thing to really get me is the scorchqueen, but even levelled players struggle against me, I ain't bragging but I'm lvl 97 and go to town on levels 1000 above me. 
---
No.
---
I’m not surprised Microsoft says the flag system isn’t automated I beg to differ I’ve seen people get suspended over some instances that obviously wasn’t verified to be authentic 
---
Damn props that guy for testing that out!!
---
Make the dog or robot companion take up a team slot. Two people two companions, or three people and one etc. I’m not gonna lie, I’d pay irl money to get/customize a doggo. Too much to ask for a borzoi?

Here you go

There are like 5, 10 that are rare really...
---
Two of those being super rare, 3 maybe. 
---
Tattered field jacket...
---
Travelling leather coat...
---
Longshore man outfit...
---
Hunters coat...
---
Mr Fuzzy outfit or whatever it's called...
---
I had the top 3 and sold the hunters jacket and field jacket for 7500 caps.. Probably could of got more but I like caps. 
---
Yup. Just with a huge focus on pve over pvp content. 
---
Hot take- anytime you have a question about the viability of a weapon head over to one of the market subs, if you see them often and they fetch anywhere over 4K caps or high end trades they are probably pretty good.
---
Ok well thx
---
what is broken? 
---
What’s AA
---
Like as a bloodied min maxer myself I always show up for the Queen to help the groups that are struggeling. I have a bunch of guys sending me invites when they drop the Queen cause they new the damage.
---
What I wish for is better tanking mehanics. So that when people try to tank with PA the monster actually focused them. 
---
Everytime I fight the queen she lands on me, turns on to me all the time. Would be nice with some better aggro holding mechanics. 
---
Btw for anyone struggeling to stay alive as bloodied build at the queen I have one word. Super Stimpacks! pop it right before she hits you. :) 
---
1.21 gigawatts

I let him know he was doing a service for the trade community, and players all. We don't have to be scared to trade or craft, remember the false rumor about trade-stealing? This is the same thing. We don't have to be worried about lies and rumors. As long as we have players willing to test it
---
Only best because of a bug where it benefits from 1h weapons. They will eventually fix this
---
My speculations- 0
---
First, you don't even know that there is going to be Robots.
---
Second, do you see anyone giving a sh#t about Troubleshooters for silos, that are full of robots. No
---
Third,  Troubleshooters weapon is 30% damage boost and its prefix effect. Not hard to beat that.
---
Bugs like this are one of the reasons why I love this game xD 
---
Especially frozen enemies, since they provide you with glorious material for taking pictures. 
---
I can take 50 psychotats and never get addicted once, but if a diseased mole rat even looks in my direction I get sick.
---
Honestly, there were problems, but they keep fixing them...
---
I hit a wall and they fix it, each update fixes a problem I find... It's like shit I wish this would happen and it does... At the moment I don't really or can't be bothered trading but I pick up loads of gear and materials, so them bringing player vending personally fixes a problem I was having...
---
I have no real problems with fallout 76... And any that arise get fixed.
---
There are bumps in the road but the game gets better and better in my point of view. Get in quick, there is a load of stuff coming in the next month's. 
---
Your getting in at a good point, there are bugs, a few glitches but name a top seller that doesn't have them... Well worth it. 
---
It's not really dlc, it's just a content update. Dlc implies that it's one large download, but these updates will be spread out over the next 100 days. Tuesday's update is relatively small, then we have our first holiday event on Friday. After that, I believe April 9th will have the largest update, with new enemies, questlines, and I believe player vending
---
You're a complete baby for screaming griefer when he was just trying to take back his workshop. 
---
As entitled as you may be, he was playing the game as the game was intended. And you cursed him out for doing it. 
---
You deserve your ban baby. 
---
Why would you come here to spread misinformation on a forum for a game that people already look for any opportunity to bash. 
---
Looking to get onto YongYea?
---
Dude you can do that event in what ever outfit you want. Except if your nuker is a idiot and you have to go inside the radiation.
---
the thing is, it's just a communications ban. meaning he can't send messages or be in a party.
---
he can still play with people and talk in in-game chat. 
---
Haha! I dig it.
---
I'm having the same issue. Everything I had favourited before maybe a month ago stays favourited. Anything else unfavourites once I've logged off and back in again.
---
go up to a cop and tell him you're gonna fuck his mom and then nuke his dog.
---
you involuntarily pay for that. 
---
Yeah I've I've accidentally scrapped some favorites weapons quite a few times.
---
I think the OP means adrenal reaction mutation. It works for me...unless it could work better ;)
---
if It launched like this it’s still get reviewed as a poor asset flip with a weak plot, poorly implemented multiplayer and an empty contentless world.
---
Holy fuck this is funny. I hope I run in to you one of these days.
---
I think when players get alcohol addiction, if they get together and discuss it, the addiction is supposed to go away. 
---
the reason there is such a good deal on such a new game should give some hints on how well this game is doing
---
While we're on that topic, please move "hardened mass" to the miscellaneous list. 
---
Also my favorite part
---
Bloodied hands down...
---
I have a bloodied hardened piercing handmade, with explosive damage and 50dr when stood still. Isn't automatic but it's lethal to most things, I don't do power armor, so I need gun power... I have a pump and a lever action with the same effects and I can go against anything and everyone. Seriously. Do go automatic. Damage output from my single shot is over 300+ at its best, lever and shotgun over 500+... Lethal.
---
Nah. 
---
It's just playing smart. 
---
There is a downside. Im giving up "first hit privlege". Gotta count on my team to keep aggro up- otherwise i lose pvp mode on you but you can hit me for full damage. 
---
Works best if i know someone is seeking revenge.
---
Are we seriously not doing that anymore? 
---
This looks completely useless against someone with TSE. I mean it only works against Melee. 
---
I did something similar with stimpacks. Stocked up on those and purified water over a few weeks (had around 1200 stims). I used super duper and chemist and started making diluted stimpacks. A month and a half passes, and my account is still unbanned.
---
Glad another user did the same thing, but amped up. 
---
OMG this is genius! Haha haha 🤣🤣
---
No, it doesnt make me a greifer. Im just playing smart and minimizing my exposure. 
---
Hmm i hope its not the case. I'll try and test it out with my AA flamer and a regular one.
---
Yeah a non combat dog would be cool too 
---
Do all of Watoga, OP. Big mistake not to 
---
Yeah that might work better i like that idea
---
I use it for combat. Nothing can hit you while you're sneaking and unyielding + shrouded makes you super sneaky. It's cheap, easily accessible, and effective early armor on any unyielding build and the wood legs at least never need to be upgraded or replaced. You do probably want a torso that can take dense and arms with mod options eventually. I swap my regular armor with wood to prove a point sometimes and other than missing dense I don't really notice any difference in my play style.
---
I’m level 64 odd and played solo from the start, aside from the odd server disruptions I love this game 
---
I’ve helped a few low level guys and done a shed load of exploration 
---
All in all a great game
---
TIL fert bags give acid, ffs i ignored so many of them
---
I've never really farmed watoga... What does it entail? 
---
Whats in the bag
---
I've got a legendary gatling plasma, they're rare though. 
---
I believe it was only Legendary ENERGY weapons that have had that possibility removed.  
---
Not greifing
---
They are gifting you material
---
It's garbage. It's a online game, where I play alone. WTF!?!?! If I wanted to play alone, I would play singleplayer game, what would mean, they can build game to be more immersive. 
---
F76 endgame is one reason why this game sucks- There are 0 mechanics, 0 teamwork, 0 challenges and humongous loot pool. Only positive thing in F76 endgame is that it can use for example "How to not build online game endgame"
---
Shit maybe they could make the game like… work? Before doing this? 
---
Nope, but I would gladly welcome this addition!! 
---
I've found the combat helmet too, it's a "real" item as you found it fully modelled in the word, not in a paper bag.
---
Anti-armor, combined with commando/ rifleman and Tank-killer perks, makes for a real "Problem Solver."
---
I have spent a lot of time in the Watoga Emergency Ser. building.  The lower level always has two liberator robots.  The upper level has 3 to 4 enemies.  It could be super m., scorched, or ghouls.  The highest level enemy is always on the top level all the way in the back next to the stairs that lead to the roof.  Its a quick building to get through,
---
Im level 160 and have been solo since i started. Team up now and then with a mate but thats purely for goofing around.
---
Nope, those are the walls you got. I like it frankly, my bedroom has a red accent wall. 
---
So hunters long coat and longshoremen outfit are not rare they are just a little annoying to acquire the wandering responder bot sells them all the time. Outfits that are rare come from events and dailies. Also the colored asylum outfits can go for a lot pink,yellow forest and red are the rarest of the asylum uniforms. BOS jumpsuit whitepowder and Whitespring Jumpsuit. Vtu jacket and jeans, western outfit with it with out chaps. Those are what people look for 
---
Fallout 76 has been a fun game all along. The drama has largely been overblown. Yes, there have been serious bugs. Bethesda has been working on them and occasionally fixing one bug caused another bug. 
---
The game now is much more stable than it was was in the early weeks of the game. One of the main reasons for server crashes appears to have been mass duplicating of items by players who took advantage of a glitch. Addressing that issue and banning a lot of the dupers appears to have improved the server issues. 
---
There's also new free content coming out. 
---
I paid full price for the game, before it was launched, and have no regrets. I can't tell you how many hours I have played.  
---
A lot. 
---
I spend all of my time in Watoga while not at West Tek and Whitesprings. I always go to EMS, the Shopping Plaza, and the School. Usually a 3 star there somewhere. Have gotten three 3 stars in Watoga, not counting from the Monster Mash event
---
He doesn’t want to do a bloodied build though lmao. I don’t either, it’s too much 
---
Oh that made me lol
---
correct, non-energy weapons still drop with explosive effect...its just not as powerful as it sounds.
---
look for anti-armor explosive or bloodied explosive...or of course the TSE which still does nice dmg.
---
The ban was a wave though with the update
---
They will, but it we'll be like the events that started in 2019- "In 2019 we are going to have interesting events for you take part every week."...and then they release it-"For each toy in your inventory, you get 5 rad resist". As you can see, until summer we get no significant new content, just old recycled meaningless content that has 0 affect on missing endgame. 
---
Ok so that all checks out. But what doesn't is asking short barrels to be  as effective as long ones. That's just not how shotgun spreads work. And to have the short be as effective as the long would then shift the burden of being useless to the long barrel because why upgrade for nothing? Maybe what they should have done is have a sawed off shotgun.  And a pump shotgun. Two different guns to not run into this issue. 
---
Those things creep me out. Definitely need to be able to place items in CAMP.
---
I do recall - in the early Farmville days - placing a bunch of Halloween cats around the chicken coop to see who would notice. Fun times. LOL 
---
Don't think that's true, believe there were users who said they were banned afterwards. In fact there was a vid earlier of a user "moving items back and forth between characters to show that did it." Do you want a link to that?
---
😂
---
Yes we get new legendary effects in summer, when they add more to endgame. 
---
If that video exists it would disprove both of us
---
Is it too much to have asked you to be a little more descriptive? Titles like this help no one if you can't explain a little bit more.  AA could mean plenty of things, like even anti-aliasing.  What are you talking about?
---
Has happened to me many times. And also electrical charge gives off shit when you get hit by anything. I once ran all the mutations at once other than herbivore cause of carnivore 
---
DLC doesnt imply one large download. 
---
It literally implies (more outright states) that the content is downloaded. That's it. 
---
Is Wild Appalachia coming on a separate disc?
---
No?
---
Than its DLC. 
---
Just a few more days 
---
1) Yes, it’s very frustrating in the early game but as you collect more perks it gets easier. There’s a perk called “Luck of the Draw” that has a chance to repair your weapon for free when used, and the leveled version activated so frequently I don’t have to repair weapons anymore. And people rarely use miniguns/heavy weapons currently because they break so quickly. 
---
2) The game’s reviews were all written in November, when it was still wicked broken. They’re not reflective of the game now, and it’s unlikely they’ll be revisited. I mean really, why is any game $60 at the end of the day? A lot of hard work and resources went into it, that’s why. 
---
3) Yes! Extremely! The bugs can be frustrating but they get better every patch, and the amount of detail put into the game shows the work they put in. I highly recommend getting it, but definitely look around for some deals 
---
Nah, it wouldn't disprove me because this post disproves him. He deleted his post because of the downvotes/callouts but I was able to find it.
---

The guy that commented earlier gave me a 3 star TSE one and he nodded it for me so...

I’ve been there and had no issues. Might just be your system or connection.

Apologies to anybody on area chat at the time.

AA? Anti-Armour? 
---
So you guys dont know? Thanks for participating... heres a trophy for each! That's real brass painted plastic bust with a wood simulated plastic base... if you scrap it, you'll get crabs...
---
I played beta and launch but quit after the first week in frustration and disappointment.
---
However, I came back during the first week in February after getting bored with Battlefield V and it's clearly evident Bethesda stuck by the game and improved it significantly. They have a way to go but I genuinely believe they listen to 'we the consumers'. The roadmap looks amazing; the future is bright. Keep those bug fixes coming, and keep listening to the Fallout faithful.
---
I'd happily exchange some real world coin for atoms to support future development.
---
I hope Bethesda continues this level of commitment to the game, even those who hate the game can't deny the effort they've put forth to improve the product (IMO).
---
DLC is content that while planned during development, wasn't intended to be in the game at release. Content updates are more for when things were planned to be added to the base game or even planned for release but were cut for time constraints. There are datamined files that implies at least the Tomahawk Scouts were planned for release, in fact they are still listed as cut content on some wikis
---
Uh, no. DLC means “downloadable content” and implies it’s a content download from the console’s store separate from the game itself. This is simply a content update. It’s not the same thing
---
I've not played on PC but I'd try unasgigning everything and reassigning it all again
---
Interesting. That could explain why my damage wasn’t registering. 
---
Does it really prove anything? I mean, do we even know if Beth is still banning based on old parameters. Maybe they saw the way the banned is wrong. Do we even know if they are banning in "realtime". Maybe they ban in waves. Has there been any bann wave after last one? 
---
While I'm yet to have any problems at WV lumber place I have encountered that problem in a different location. Whenever I'm farming white springs, I cannot go inside the first two houses to the left of the golf course. My screen immediately freezes and 8 out of 10 times I have to force close the game. Never happens to my buddy though. 
---
Not a ban wave, but this video claims that he was suspended shortly after "moving items between accounts" https://youtu.be/zzcvTjXEElc
---
Its perfectly fine. 
---
https://imgur.com/FPABWb5
---
Yeah they patched it
---
It has not been confirmed. They only said something like:"You might lose more than junk, maybe few aid items. It is not clear at the moment"
---
I don't spam chems or booze, but I use the regularly and I have yet to be come addicted after after 200 lvls of game play. I drink a beer every time I trade and use psycho/ect every time I'm in a tough battle. I think it may be bugged. 
---
Yep, I already turned it off and turned it back on again so to speak. Did some more testing. I put the offending weapons in my stash and it works correctly. But if I have more than two of the same weapon base type (three missile launchers for example) in my inventory then it pulls up the first one alphabetically instead of the one assigned.
---
Don't bother with drops. Just buy the weapons from forums/discord
---
&gt; Nah, it wouldn't disprove me because this post disproves him. He deleted his post because of the downvotes/callouts but I was able to find it. 
---
The sub reddit downvotes anything that doesn't support the bullshit narrative, this video straight up proved innocent people are being banned.  He didn't do an exploit, he picked up ammo
---
the holotape you are referencing is in the OP's list.
---
&gt; 13.  Nuke launch 
---
To be fair, it’s in the ToS, which everyone “reads” when they sign up. What’s really neat is Microsoft essentially owns your entire digital library, so if you get proper banned for whatever reason, kiss all that money goodbye because you’re never getting those digital games back.
---
Lots of interesting details in the ToS, it’s quite the read.
---
Performance has seen a noticeable improvement. Many of the exploits have been fixed and a number of the exploiters banned. 
---
There have been numerous quality of life improvements, such as but not limited to showing you if you already learned recipes, choosing to respec a SPECIAL point upon level up, vendors being far less RNG with their stock, balance changes, doubled Stash storage capacity, etc
---
Some upcomming updates are just around the cornor with some long anticipated changes and additions, like placing junk on display in your CAMP, new quests, new events, new crafting (brewing) and more, hardcore pvp mode. 
---
You can check for yourself, Bethesda has announced their plans for the next ~9months in their roadmap.
---
Just take your time and absorb everything that the map has to offer. No sense trying to power to endgame, which is honestly a bit lacking and right now just comes down to farming high level mobs for Legendary items. 
---
Yeah but I have no idea how that even works. 
---
No, theres no soecific interior walls. 
---
The brick wall set has a plaster interior side, which looks fine, and while there are no plain plaster interior ones, with a little clever room planning you can simply make the brick a feature wall. 
---
Nikos has a mule account, do you want a vid of him moving ammo to that, too?
---
Your comment added nothing constructive. Thank you for wasting everyone's time
---
&gt; Nikos has a mule account, do you want a vid of him moving ammo to that, too?
---
He can do whatever he wants that other video straight up proved they are banning people who are innocent lol.  That was a brand new account, he didn't do any exploits on it 
---
Hey there I'm open to offers starting at 600 caps

Haha

Sorry no I don't but I'll keep an eye out for ya

LOL, nice...

Awfully quick to get banned after picking it up then. Other people are reporting it days after. He also cut his vid out, pretty suspicious. He claims it's because it would have been an hour long then, hs
---
I've been having fun since day one of the beta. I may agree on the flaws, but when all is said and done I'm having fun on the game, and that is what matters to me.
---
And these little bugs like the one in the picture brings endless fun. Perfect photo opportunities and my personal favourite is sending them flying - shoot them while they are stuck like this and there is every chance they get launched into the air. 
---
It's the simple things in life!
---
Nope. The enemies spawn at a level based on the average level of all players in the area. 
---
Yup. I don’t really mind it honestly, the barn set’s interior walls look pretty good imo. If you want something more put together then get the brick set, the windows are perfect and the interior is white 
---
Is there a certain place in Watoga that you found the best results, or do you go building to building until you find the legendary?
---
From your post I'm gonna say that you shouldn't buy it. If FO4 wasn't doing it for you then this game probably isn't for you either. I was very wary of buying it as well because of the bad publicity. I ended up picking it up a few days ago and and I'm actually having a really good time playing it but only because of my buddy that convinced my to buy it plays with me. It's a very different experience with the world feeling so "empty" as a lot of people call it. Having no hilarious NPCs to interact with really killed the whole feel that I go for when I play fallout but I just accepted the game for what it is instead of what I expected the new Fallout to be.
---
Not sure what’s better. The maze or this guys vert &amp; jumping skill.

You're not paying much attention. The kids are playing exactly the way teens and adults are playing. He attributed the style of play to the fact that it was kids, but there's no difference at all. 
---
Oh I see, well then I'm useless for this question!
---
How do you get the asylum uniforms
---
I would like off Mr Bones wild ride
---
You can get all plans now 
---
😂well thanks anyway
---
Events drop the forest and red outfit the rest can be found in fort defiant 
---
&gt; Awfully quick to get banned after picking it up then.
---
Yeah it was
---
&gt; Other people are reporting it days after.
---
Expecting consistency from bethesda?  He says in the video he waits to get the email from bethesda saying he is banned before logging in again
---
&gt; He also cut his vid out, pretty suspicious 
---
Yeah he says in the video he waited until he got an email saying he was banned, did you expect him to record a turned off tv for an hour?
---
Ok thx bro
---
Yes Anti-Armor
---
Don’t forget Watoga civic center, has ghouls and on top floor there’s usually a legendary enemy, also do Generals Steakhouse, spawns up to a couple legendaries if you’re lucky. 
---
What was the mod? Can't read it on the video on my phone. 
---
This game is great on Xbox, I have no major issues and absolutely love it, I’d say with new content dropping on Tuesday and more to come over the year now is a great time to buy 👍
---
If you need plans, there is a random weapon plan/ mod just south of the Ranger station in Cranberry Bog, it’s in a trench with a blue tarp over it. 
---
Was this xbox? I was on a server where it seemed like everyone else was down there. I didn't like the way it was nuked and didn't have much rad away or water to thin it down so just logged off to help free up bandwidth
---
Running on Asus g750 laptop with mid to high settings. Not a single problem with framerates or disconnected or any of that mess 
---
But real talk - where’d  you find the bathrobe?
---
Could you please explain further? I wasn’t aware it was broken.
---
You're an imbecile. 
---
Don't be a dink.
---
I think its not working now and some youtubers says it too i dont see any damage changes wit this legendary effect.
---
Please report your findings! I’m very curious about this.
---
What platform? I'm asking because aside from the loot loading issues, which I have very rarely, I can't say that I have any problems at WS, nuked or not.
---
As for farming for loot and XP, hit West-Tek. Lots of high level muties and a chance for legendaries. In and outside.
---
Whitesprings is the problem area for me, especially during nukes. It’s gotten bad enough that I have to move super slow around it, because I’ve crashed 4 times in a row from WS nukes 
---
I don't care why he fights I just want to able to find the bastard, can we get him a bell or something?
---
SD Plaza with Phoenix, then Watoga EMS, then Watoga HS. Always do Monster Mash, I've gotten two in one run there. 3 stars. I don't bother with 1s. Always do Hordes in the Bog, and always do AWOL Armaments
---
Your post inspired me to share this lovely image of mine:

How do you tame an animal? 
---
Guts Punch. You hopped, but no worries! Wish you could have heard our chat. "Woah, look at this! What is this, a maze? Is that a deathclaw? Awesome!"
---
How could you make such a thoughtful song so horrifying 😂
---
Ah, thanks for the good question. Platform is xbox, added that in the post.
---
I'll have to certainly try West Tek. Thanks.
---
I'm only level 50 but it feels like I'll be saving up the 22,000 caps for the Marsupial recipe until I'm lvl 200.
---
You are a legend and a creative genius.  Best video ever.  Thanks for the laughs.  
---
My camp is currently situated on a cliff side close to top of the world overlooking down into the forest. It’s a small two level wood cabin with an outside patio out back overlooking the cliff. I have a front porch area with a fireplace and a couple rocking chairs. Kitchen and chem station when you first enter the house followed by a little living room area and the back patio. On the second level there is my bedroom and a restroom inside as well as an upper level outdoor balcony overlooking the forest. 
---
That's the one I have my camp on. 
---
This is all we know at the moment. 
---
I wish survival mode questions like these got more upvotes so the devs could see we are asking questions!!!
---
Well according to pre-release info all dlc will be free so really there isn't much of a difference. But to me, DLC implies large additions. I only make the the point that it's not dlc because players will be pretty disappointed by The first content patch if they think it will be a large addition
---
I've told a cop I'd fuck his sister. I already knew him though so the gut punch wasn't as bad as it could've been.
---
And PVP. PVP is still atrocius with melee being far better than any other builds
---
This is something i have wondered too, I always wondered if upgrading my console would improve games.
---
It doesn't and it should. Awareness shows not reduced energy resistance with an anti-armor testa rifle for example. 
---
That video is hilarious. He makes a big deal about showing himself making a character and going straight to trading ammo back and forth. Then, **video break uh oh** and magically he’s banned? 
---
He could have done anything on that account between cuts and we’d never know.
---
I hope there will be roleplay servers as well.
---
Now that you mention I think I actually do have that perk equipped. That would explain it then. 
---
I blame the Sea People 
---
SD Plaza with Phoenix?  Thanks for the info!
---
Yes. It’s useless as proof if he doesn’t. Anything could have happened between the cuts. And the only way we know how much time passed is based upon what he said. 
---
That isn’t proof.
---
&gt;The only thing my Bostie would attack is someone's face with kisses
---
"You have contracted Parasites!"
---
This is beautiful 
---
r and d?  Do you mean RNG?
---
I disagree with players being wary of others territories.
---
The entire point was socialize and reclaim the Appalachian area.
---
That was the point of the game and why the only other people to interact with were players. (Sucks that some people just end up acting like jerks and ruin it for others who want to have fun).
---
That being said, excellent job on this. Nice use of taking and your camp building skills.
---
Wasn't much to do in gtaonline the first while either. But now it's full of stuff to do. Packed to the brim.
---
 It's an online game. The hardcores will have stayed with it. Hopefully more will come back in. I'm hopeful the game will be around a few years with a growing base. The roadmap makes me hopeful
---
 - Will I see other players on the map?
---
 - What drops on death? 
---
 - Caps lost on death?
---
 - Will there even be bounties?
---
 - Can I take my PvP gear with me to survival?
---
I role play as a structural inspector. If I see someone with a “contemporary” camp with no supports I am destroying it. We are trying to rebuild America here people. Floating structures with no bracing is for communists. 
---
Not a clue. I do know theres one that spawns on highway 65. Take a stroll and find out.
---
I don't have problems running anything, I'm still using a launch day X1. If you don't clean it out occasionally it'll overheat more easily and slow down.
---
Any chance you get the heavy metal plans as well?
---
Yes, I lost all of my hundreds of pounds of junk I had been hauling around. I was over everweight  300+/190
---
No clue why you get downvoted, you’re claims are correct and OP shouldn’t have cussed at anyone in the Xbox TOS
---
No. But you can put two walls up. Build doorway on one side, remove the foundation underneath it, should be able to place a wall on the other foundation. Then just put the foundation back and change the doorway into a normal wall. Worked for me anyways. Doorways allow you to remove fundations for some reason.
---
I’ve always oven things away because others have always been very helpful to me. This guy was a rarity. Most people I come across are very generous and helpful. I figured he was just trying to give me something in return.
---
Bankruptcy: An effect that gives a player a debuff of -50% PvP damage for 3 hours. 
---
You get Bankruptcy for dying in PvP and not having enough caps to pay the loss or bounty.
---
How do you know it is crashing the server, seems unlikely but ...
---
How much weight is your character carrying ? I found on one of my characters which carries about 1600 - 1800lbs its laggy, not sure if it is related.
---
Holy cow, thats powerful. So you can get weight of weapons to zero?
---
Yeah also to add, it doesn't complete the quest. It's ongoing, we don't know if she made it out of the mountain b&amp;b. The nuke holotape shows up in silo alpha after a launch, so she maybe alive. It's right before the elevator on the shelf.
---
This is the only game I had this issue with.
---
Not so far, only noticed the event 3 times though, and there's no notification that it's happening so there's no telling how many times I've missed it. It's always been while I was walking from one place to another though.
---
I thought people were being banned for having certain rare items? Regular ammo isn't being looked at, it's got to be Ultracite ammo, that's what the 900 hour guy did. If it's  regular ammo or stimpacks or anything like that Bethesda doesn't care. Probably because why would someone bother to duplicate something if it wasn't rare.
---
Exactly. This guy Go has such a Bethesda hate hard on that he'll accept "proof" that wouldn't hold up anywhere. 
---
If you want to prove something, yes you do indeed need to not stop filming.  
---
Did I also mention I saw Bigfoot yesterday? I saw something dark in the bushes, waited a while, stopped filming cause it had been an hour, then he came right up to me! I turned my camera back on but he was gone, but I filmed some hairs on the ground!
---
That's undeniable proof! 
---
Lol. Sad.
---
I have both X and S consoles and occasionally have cause to play on the S and it’s quite noticeable how much worse it runs. I play maybe 10-20% of my 76 on the S and that’s where I get at least 90% of the crashes 
---
I havent managed to get any to zero and not a math statistics person and dont dig into coding of game in general but my guns weigh about a 1 or 2 each with all my weight red stuff, melee down to like .1.
---
It was pretty much nuked with fissure prime dead centre of the nuke zone, and yes it was Xbox. Could you recall any usernames?
---
I'm barely under capacity in my stash and my character is like 285/330, or something like that. Definitely not overweight.  I should clarify this in my post, thanks!
---
I like the idea. Like apex have a champion kill leader. You enter the server and it shows you his stats as you enter xD
---
I would love to get my hands on those though, I feel like the energy DR workd me markedly better on the heavy version.
---
And I know it's crashing the server because anyone who I'm playing with also gets disconnected at the exact same time. Tested with multiple people.
---
Yeah been searching for them like forever but no luck...
---
So I can still find it on a shotgun if I farm enough?
---
It’s a rolling content season, that’s why it’s not DLC. That’s my entire point. DLC would be like Far Harbor or NukaWorld
---
It can’t be a set spawn gotta be a random, I’m trying my best to find one but they’re rare as it is 
---
When a guy stops a video randomly to prove a ban for something, I immediately assume he stopped recording, duped and tried to force a ban, then recorded again. 
---
This is the internet. Film it all or it's bullshit.
---
Whitesprings camper here :) I love the ambiance, especially having a nice green lawn. I use the barn set and have built a little clubhouse and shop called “The Rough” 
---
I thought the 900 hour guy was banned due to multiple accounts and how he was transferring between accounts. Not sure what methods are in use or worked in the past, but other games I have seen dup bugs using containers which he claimed in his post to use. 
---
Is that in roses line of quests? It's been awhile. If it is, remember it would reset if you didn't complete it all.
---
No new content and they've maybe fixed a quarter of the bugs in the game. Still no endgame. So no. 
---
Is that how the awareness perk works though? I would imagine it just shows you their resistances before any penetration effects are calculated.
---
yes I would like this very much. statistic page like other fallout and elder scrolls games.  I would like to track how many deathclaws / scorchbeasts / queens killed etc. 
---
I haven't even seen the sturdy ones tbh. If I figure it out I'll lyk though.
---
Oooh ok... i really hope i get those plans. Or either bethesda will bring them to the vendors...
---
What's your gamertag? Asking for a friend.
---
Yeah sturdy as well.... ok man thanks!
---
“Structural Inspector” is a strange way to spell “griefer” 
---
Originally there were tons of post saying they were banned for crafting regular ammo/food/trading for nuka colas. This happened right after the initial ban wave. It was all duper lies
---
I build off of existing structures. 
---
I'm currently finishing a build with a shack and truck base, that has become a solid 5 building compound that fits the setting well, and will likely end up at 6 buildings, maybe 7.
---
It's the grafton mayors quest. I can't seem to find the quest in my pipboy and I can't seem to activate it either by listening to the radio.
---
I don’t think so. Base damage is too low to compare to the top unarmed weapons, even with an extra 60% damage. And assuming you max out the damage perk cards, you only have space for one more maxed melee perk. Incisor. Now you can’t use martial artist and aren’t getting the attack speed boost from it.
---
Also, due to Incisor, anti-armor on melee/unarmed is of questionable value. Bloodied might be worth a ton of caps, but if they’re asking for more than 1k for that anti-armor meat hook, wouldn’t bother. Even then I’d rather save that 1k to put towards a real nice DCG or power fist.
---
The player who crafted this ammo also has a mule account he uses to move ammo around
---
Because it’s one of the most resource demanding games. There are few other games that have such a large map
---
I was just kidding around. But I do hate those floating camps. Don’t people have self respect?
---
Porta-potties as well, lol!
---
The problem is there’s nothing to do late game. I’m level 70 something and all I have to do are events, which are extremely tedious.
---
I ran out of resources on my little two structure camp. Maybe I like decorations too much?
---
Sounds like my kind of camp!
---
I'm not sure why some of the plans are so randomn while some of the others are so set bbn in stone. Metal would be one of the basic ones you would think. Although, with the right mods Heavy Leather is almost as good and the energy DR helps a ton with Scorchbeasts.
---
That's not good. Hope they look into it. Maybe disable all your quests and empty the perks out, unequip gun, armor, and see if you can't narrow it down to something.
---
I’d get pissed with all the scorched attacks putting my house there. I legit mourn Bessie every time she dies. 
---
Okay, I’m a floating CAMP kind of person and I’ve got plenty of self respect. I got self respect coming out the wazoo. 
---
So much so, I can say “wazoo” unironically. 
---
Communists make the nukes fly?
---
It’s an affliction I too suffer from that I brought with me from Fallout 4. When I found a Radroach in a top hat sitting on a toilet with a wedding ring in his loot table during the beta it re-ignited the flames once more and now there’s no hope for me, I’m also still in the habit of opening then jumping back in case it’s booby trapped lol
---
Just hop on game chat and cuss the little kids out until they cry and quit. You can say whatever you want to them in-game unless it's violent or hate speech, so go ahead and tell the little fucking shits that their parents don't love them, their dog will run away just to leave, etc.
---
I do agree. Questioning it myself.... hope they will bring it in the game....
---
I've never become addicted when using chems regularly, across 4 characters.
---
You need to spam-use the same chem 4-7 times and you always get an addiction.
---
You get the notification "you have become addicted to X", the SPECIAL debuff and the Junkie's weapon damage boost.
---
Got a regular Pickman here!
---
If you go into your challenges under “combat” they have various ones for different enemies. Most of them are “Kill [enemy] with [weapon type].” Not sure if they ever truly complete, I know they can go as high as 1100. It’s a non-streamlined way of checking your stats for kills 
---
Beautiful 
---
Long shot works in vats, you get a slight increase in hit percentage with each rank. Even more so through a scope. Tried and tested, unless it's pure luck or coincidence my.percentage goes up with the perk, I've added and remove the card whilst using vats on the same target... When it's on my chances are better... 
---
How have you come to find these facts out? If you don't mind me asking...
---
It's just my build seems to be the dogs bollocks and that isn't based on luck, more through trial and error. 
---
Watoga has the handmade plan. I’m level 90 
---
Do you carry a lot of Plans/Recipes and/or Holotapes on your character? I've heard that this can cause issues for some players but you are the first to say that you crash the whole server.
---
“Ok guys it’s totally the same day oops lemme stop my camera from pointing at the window showing night outside, it’s definitely still 2:48pm. And as we see I am banned. Clearly shooting bullet holes to spell out “Bethesda sucks donkey dick” on the side of the Whitesprongs will get you banned!”
---
Always check the vendors stash. Picked up a pump shotgun TSE for 200 caps
---
&gt; Yes. It’s useless as proof if he doesn’t
---
This subreddit is beyond belief.  hailcorporate to the maximum
---
Who cares what other people do man. If you don’t like that camp style, great, but don’t judge others for liking it. We all have different taste and preferences. 
---
How do you build a third story? It never let's me place the stair for a third floor.
---
I just have a seat on the bench. Most seem so thrown off that I’m waiting my turn they get spooked or something and leave. 
---
No can't remember names I just saw a massive amount of ppl all together at that spot right before the event. I could feel the lag and that night my base was wiped when I logged off. It was like really early morning for me 6ish(pst)
---
Hm? I don’t have any scorched attacks ever. In fact the only attacks I ever have are super mutants and only occasionally 
---
Laughs in scorchbeast
---
Not sure how they did it, but you can use stairs to build down off a ledge.
---
ARE YOU SCARED!
---
Junkie's weapons are not really that bad. Not effective as a min maxed bloodied build, but not shiet either.
---
With the right addictions, for a 50% damage boost (the cap is 5) the only heavy debuff is the -4 STR, so it's not the end of the world if you aren't a melee build or an hoarder.
---
Not particularly, no.  I don't keep known plans around for long, but I probably have quite a few hollow tapes on my person just because I've never bothered to clear them out.
---
If you build on a steeper hill or cliff side your build height seems to be elongated letting you build slightly higher. I have 3 levels on my camp as well. I'm on a steep drop off.
---
With that kind of confidence I have no doubt your floating camp will remain stable. God bless 
---
If the allow dogs, I’m renaming my character to John Wick. 
---
Yeah, that's absolutely what I should do.  But, testing things results in crashing servers :/
---
I tested it thoroughly when I was testing the different perks on the pipe weapons to see what stacked and what didn't. Long Shot and Crack Shot provide no passive benfits; you have to be actively ADS. The percentage point or 3 you saw was most likely a small difference in distance from the target, or one of the other 1,000 variables that come into play with VATS accuracy in FO76.
---
......and now I want to have a Vox mutation that turns me into Dr Dolittle and eavesdrop on all the fallout wildlife all the time lol
---
Same.
---
^this^ it seems crazy to me that the test card isn’t a thing on tvs since it’s a massive thing in fallout 
---
Question about blocker.. do you have to be 'blocking' for it to trigger?
---
I wasn’t really personally judging anyone. I just wanted to make a funny on the internets
---
I'm not sure what I expected but this was hilariously bad.
---
Grats you inconvenienced someone while they just stood and stared at you.
---
Just stop man.
---
And to yours as well!
---
Same! I’ve not experienced it myself though 
---
&gt; hailcorporate
---
Did you mean heil? I feel like that makes it punchier and more “teenage edge lord.” Try it you might like it.
---
Far less buggy, far more stable servers, lot of dupers / dupes banned (but they still do exist), better communication from BGS, we have an actual roadmap that looks really exciting, many general improvements.
---
Just some toys 
---
He just wants to cuddle.

Here is one location, there are various locations across the map

*F   u   N   n   I   e   S*
---
Thanks for reporting this, OP. Hopefully when they fix the loop loot bug where the load circle is neverending this get fixed. How did you find this one out, OP? Thought it was kind of a rare occurrence
---
This guy lists a bunch of locations which is cool, I hit #2 https://youtu.be/YRP02uM6hIc
---
Try a fresh character and see if it still happens.
---
You still playing FO76? What part of the game can still be interesting? You can achieve max level in 3-4 days easily and complete all quests in the game about 4-5 days. Is there something I have missed that gives so much more content to play it 3-4 months? Taking selfie pictures with boring costumes or hoarding pointless junk isn't really what I count for content. 
---
Thx bro, appreciate it!
---
Hardened mass doesn't get scrapped now... You have to scrap it manually. 
---
As for dropping a players strength stat... Well that won't do anything, I'd just shoot you. 
---
Sorry dude, but its not intended, and that makes it griefing. If you need that advantage you're going to have a real hard time when people can actually engage you on fair terms.
---
My husband and I have a side by side gaming set up. I have the first Xbox one and his is the newer one. Mine crashes 20 x more than his and this is not an exaggeration.
---
Well my CAMP is technically three story, and I didn't have any problem with it. I have moved my CAMP around as well, so I know it works properly everywhere.
---
I accidentally attacked someone’s pet sloth once :( okay maybe twice I have done this. Second one was near watoga. Sloth was already red towards me so I went all sneaky since it hadn’t noticed me yet, started firing away at the poor cute creature. Eventually I noticed through my scope that there was a camp. I immediately felt bad for attacking the poor sloth. The owner showed up and had to put poor slothy down :( 
---
Seeing the Anthem subs in full melt down really has me appreciating the devs efforts. The 76 launch was an absolute shit show, but for the most part everything has made it better or at least showed effort in the right direction.
---
Seeing another game I wanted launch poorly, then just continue to plummet has not been fun. I’ve logged well over 200 hrs in 76 before I felt the urge to split my time to something else. I swore Anthem was going to be the game that finally did it. Boy was I wrong. 
---
This is exactly what I'm talking about. Emotional investment in our characters and camps are NOTHING compared to what I'm willing to throw down for a doggo.
---
Its a FO4 left over. Hopefully they actually do something with it later and give us pets.
---
will see 
---
I just get behind the vendor so the person selling will see me under the menus. I duck down and go invisible with my chameleon armor and that usually freaks them out enough to exit the menu.
---
 Terrible. As a charter member of the Stabby Stabby club, I had hoped that we, as more enlightened beings, would eschew such trashy behavior. ;)     
---
I seem to recall, back in Far Harbor, that none of the Hermit Crabs were truly random.  It's probably because they are rather large, ungainly enemies that don't "fit" in many spaces (and look silly when they aren't on flat surfaces).  In 76, I've never seen them outside of the highway in the Mire and sporadically during SBQ battles.  Both spaces are relatively flat.
---
I feel like its really bizzare to be that invested in killing other people's virtual dogs. Get a hobby man, one that takes you into contact with other humans.
---
toxic larry's meat and go (mire)- guaranteed spawn of 3x snallygasters, each 5-8 acid. server hop as much as you need to. Though with Beth's new same(ish) server spawn policy it is harder.  
---
(this is a combined  acid, caps, magazine and bobblehead run) Mags and Bobbleheads are random spawns, if at all.  
---
Darling sisters lab (forest) - 1 to 3 Hallucigen Canisters (5 each) , 1x Abraxo cleaner (1 each), 1 bobblehead on top of trailer.  
---
Whitesprings - 0 to 8 fertilizer bags (1 each), 0-15 Abraxo cleaner (1 each), occasional 2 magazines, 2 bobbleheads in Golf house  
---
Silva homestead (forest)  in barn with project beanstalk robot-  6 Chlorine bags (3 each).   
---
 1 to 3 Coolant bottles in large barn with tractors and PA frame. Magazine and bobblehead in farmhouse itself  
---
Kanawha cemetery- 2 bags of fertilizer, small work shed north wall, west of church. Also has 5 cement and 4 empty paint tins.   Area usually spawns 6+ bloatflies , their glands are 2 each. Cap stash in church.  
---
just down road from cemetery, Lewis and sons supplies. 4 fertilizer bags, 3 to 5 bottles of coolant (2 each) , 1 makeshift battery  (2 each), 1 bobblehead and magazine in same shed as PA frame.  
---
Yeah I’m kinda sad I know you can get megasloths and deathclaws I was kinda hoping 
---
&gt;This is only happens on one (lvl 153 or so) character.  My other, low level character (23) plays just fine.
---
I heard if you get them out of order you need to play the last one again.
---
I like to wait till they’re distracted or seem really angry and gunnel visioned, back out of the vendor and pop a stun quick, then open vendor again. They *know* you popped out and back in and it infuriates the impatient jerk soooo much.
---
If you want to subdivide a house into rooms, I suggest using the warehouse building set to create partitions.  It kind of fits the Fallout motif, although it would clash a bit with the plaster side of the brick materials.
---
 Who has room for all this crap? I have about 35lbs of non scrapped junk. I try to pass on legendaries but usually Wallace or Phoenix ends up with em'. ;)
---
Your suggestion helped, I think my power armor was causing the issue.  I unequipped my power armor as soon as I joined and the server didn't crash (editing post to reflect this)
---
Sounds good 
---
I've heard treasure maps can cause problems..  do you have a tonne of those on your character? 
---
Can you be more specific? I scoured the tranches in that area, maybe I’m not “just south” enough :)
---
I'm doing automatic because the medic effect is better with shotguns or automatic guns. I'm gonna give it a shot with my auto handmade 
---
Um, what's broken about it?  Works fine to me.
---
Didn't you just say it was a bad insult? Nice self own, my dude. Go back to your life changing Fallout 76 experience.
---
I actually love that idea, that your dogs just don't attack other vault dwellers because even when we fight, they're way better people than we are. Also the idea of running into someone only to stop and have us both watch our dogs play sounds fucking amazing. 
---
I like to build camps in high places for the views, with tents and canopies on concrete bases. Can be tricky returning to base, so I need to wear PA because you can end up in the middle of a mountain.
---
I'm not angry, I'm just calling out the insane amount of cognitive dissonance around this subreddit.  I was never banned
---
A friend of mine had a bug for this quest the first 3+ weeks of release. It's not the same kind, but i'll tell it anyway in case anyone else has a similar problem. He'd crashed while trying to accept his military certificate and thus, the game registered the quest as complete, but he didn't get the quest reward and didn't have the right documents for the DMV. If anyone else has experienced this particular glitch and has friends who were able to complete Recruitment Blues - get a friend to drop the certificate - they can get another from Camp Mclintock at any time.
---
Please tell me you're on xbox and can I visit
---
I only had location specific problems (looking at you Grafton) when running a targeting HUD on my power armor.

Yep, it's bloody annoying and resets itself every time you join a server.  It happens when you have multiple Legendaries of the same type of weapon, but with different prefixes (i.e. Instigating Super Sledge, Vampire Super Sledge).  I guess, in this instance All Rise is treated as a basic Super Sledge.
---
Bethesda knows about it, but I haven't seen any estimate on when they plan to fix it.
---
I do this too, but it’s from all my years of playing the Fallout franchise. I can’t leave a location unless I feel like I’ve thoroughly searched every nook and cranny, because you never know what you might find. In 76 I’ve found several photo ops in stalls and porta potties lol. 
---
I’ve gotten addicted twice to psycho and both times it never displayed in my pip boy. I’m not sure if addictions get cured or if they just don’t display
---
You do indeed. One of the first things I do on a new character is craft and scrap a bunch of leather left arms to learn all the leather mods. They apply to all variants, sturdy, heavy etc, and you only lose 1 steel per arm of you craft the level 1. The only mods I haven't been able to get through this so far are ultra light and deep pocketed, but it takes about 500 to unlock the rest so maybe I just quit 5 minutes before the miracle lol.
---
Heavy Leather Armor, with the Studded mod and crafted with a high intelligence or the 200% bonus perk, has the physical and energy DR to rival power armor. It's better than Raider and Excavator, minus the no radiation DR. You could go lead lined on all 5 limbs and get 50, but I would rather go with a padded or asbestos chest, stabalized arms (literally completely eliminating the sway while manually aiming with a scope; if it doesn't work when you first apply the mod you have to log out and back in), and muffled or custom fitted legs. You can go with whatever mod combo suits you best though, a lot of the mods take the place of perks so you can put those valuable points somewhere else.
---
Plungers rule 
---
The biggest thing I can say is that I wanted a new game with the "fallout" feeling. Not New Vegas 2 which it seems like a lot of people expected. 
---
Honestly, before the recent updates, I really enjoyed the game. Bethesda has put in a lot of work to make sure the game is great, despite what most people would say. After the updates, I have been getting lost playing this game. Like playing for hours on end without even realizing it. 
---
If you get this game, just bear in mind that there will be hiccups, but that's to be expected with any online game. If you're expecting FO3, FO4 or FONV, you should consider playing those games instead.
---
I envision the game slightly bugging and the angle contorts its head.  
---
**Screeech.** The heavily armed ford exploder came to a stop. "What in the hell are doing Fred!?"

---
I understand that, and I believe it is the first person in the area actually then as other join the area they respawn. You were not talking about the level they spawn at. You were talking about the damage the player does to them. While it may not seem like it, I bet if you took all of the buffs away from a lvl 100 toon they would do the same amount of damage a level one does. Because there is no hard cap on levels, I believe that the actual level does not increase damage, the special point and the perk card you use do. 
---
The responders vendors sell the sturdy and heavy variants of the leather armor.
---
In your appeal, write that you were playing fallout, an m rated game that is rated for swearing and shouldn't be punished for adult behavior in an adult game. 
---
Starting at level 1.
---
What were you expecting lol 
---
replace your cuss with non cuss
---
fish off you massive oblong 
---
Would upgrading your engine make your car go faster or run better?
---
Anywhere there's enemies there's legendaries. The last worthwhile ones I've came from places like harpers ferry and fort defiance. Whitespring seems to be quantity over quality. 
---
Yep.  Most of the time, the loot is pretty lame.
---
Sometimes you'll get plans, mainly Prime Receivers.  Some say even Dense armor plans are possible.  But considering the time and resource sink of Scorchbeasts, the loot is not adequate.
---
Once you hit a certain point SB are nothing to kill. They do drop prime receiver plans though, which is primarily why I farm them.
---
So evil and wonderful. Love it!
---
Same thing has happened to me twice now. the 1st time she went down 20% then no more damage, the second time she quickly went down, she then regenerated, we got her down to 50% again with 20 mins to go and she took no more damage at all , something needs to be done about this
---
That was even better than the last one. You're use of CAMPs for deathtraps is truly a wonder to behold.
---
Having a blast! I love this game....
---
It didn’t cost you anything, you were careless.
---
The level requirements for perks only unlock the ability to acquire said perks. The packs are a random assortment... you can choose to select the master pickpock ability now but you’re never guaranteed to open anything in a pack
---
Right. It doesn't run perfectly, as I've come to expect from Bethesda's games, but I don't get freezing or crashes. It might stutter in high traffic areas, but I have more problems with servers than I do with my hardware.
---
So I have to reach leve 45 to get a chance at getting it?
---
I use 2 accounts when farming. I nuke whitesprings and leave one account on it to hold a few workshops and so I can rejoin, then I just continually rejoin with my main and clear all of WS. The ghoul spawns are exact. You will always get spawns in the exact same places - unless something interferes. Any time there's an ash or goo pile, I've noticed that ghoul will never respawn. It's particularly annoying when using my farming method, since that means the server I'm on is then less than optimal.
---
Thanks for the info!  I haven't tried Harpers Ferry or Fort Defiance yet.
---
I get a lot of crashes during Whitesprings nukes on the PS4, I don’t think it can handle the amount of glowing ones that spawn. 
---
So being swarmed by a dozen oozing glowing Bois while using a melee weapon.... Auto stim wouldn't be handy for that?
---
 I did one yesterday and got food. Its all I expect and you scored a Western Revolver! 
---
 Did 3 65s but one got away, earlier in the same day. ;)
---
I do bloodied automatic and my damge gets up close to that high, with the difference that when I do a crit then every round that hits on that pull is a crit.
---
Which is super nice for PVP with those jokers who think sentinel assassin gear can save you~
---
A silly question, but what does the VTU Baseball Cap even look like?  I can't find any pictures of it, and I'm sure I've never seen one in the wild.
---
WHAT’S IN THE BAG MAN 
---
The SBQ can drop them.
---
Have you experienced the invisible death claw that kills you and you cannot fight it?  That one is fun too. 
---
I believe the Queen can drop them, or it might be a reward for Scorched Earth, not sure which 
---
I get more stutters usually, but usually no crashes. I've had glowing one legions + scorchbeast quartet crash my game before, but that was an isolated incident.
---
I hope you didn't find the named corpse of a dog near cranberry bog...
---

---
No, each level you have to option to select any perk whose level requirement you’ve unlocked. You only get the perk packs every 5 levels but can choose ANY perk your lvl allows for. 
---
So next level you should be able to select master, even though you haven’t gotten it in a pack
---
are you trying to refine lead ore? if so, I’d recommend simply mining lead at Grafton Steel workshop.
---
I’m fairly confident a lead ore / acid location may not exist.
---
Don't quote me on this, but I've heard the SBQ can drop one.  Rarely.
---
That's provided you can even kill her in the first place, which is very hit-and-miss these days.
---
I have not experienced this - I have used my vampire’s Tesla to kill waves at Whitesprings, and every new player in the area causes a complete respawn of them all
---
No you can unlock it with your perk points which you get every time you level up
---
My suggestion would be find an acid one and mine lead from the lucky hole mine using excavator PA you will get hundreds of lead ore plus use super duper when smelting. 
---
There is only one at lake Eloise and it is right by a fissure, so you have to deal with continuous scorchbeast attacks, In order to use both you have to place you camp half down the cliff.
---
Oh I see. I didn't know that's what people were claiming. Thank you.
---
No.  Just looking for a base I can get a lead scrap extractor for ammo and an acid extractor for a variety of ore processing. 
---
I love playing solo, at least for the first 40 levels or so, it felt like a single player game. But this is also due to me not having any friends...
---
Any proof of this. Data from your experience? Links to said youtubers? Anything?
---
Anti-Armor should provide a flat 28.8 percent increase in damage IF you have no other armor penetration stats. If you have said increases (magazine mod, perk cards) the increase is less because all of these effects get multiplied together. For example: Anti-armor(50%) plus 3 stars in the rifle armor pen perk (36%) don't yield a net 86% armor penetration. They net a 68% percent armor pen total.
---
&gt; But I can make a dozen gamertags right now and be completely anonymous.
---
Nope.  Each of those tags will be logged in via an IP address.  Which is assigned to a particular ISP.  Who then assigns it to a particular customer.
---
It's not like the police would just stop at talking to Microsoft or Sony, since you can log in to a console that isn't at your house.
---
Or if you really want to refine all ore types, pick any acid location... for lead specifically I go to lucky hole mine in the bog.  So. Much. Lead. 
---
Grafton drags my FPS down to half the moment I load in there. Not sure if it's those pillars of smoke or the glowing, seems more system based in my instance. 
---
I recall reading the game is better optimized near 76 but not sure if there is any truth to it. Does seem to run very smoothly in the Forest however. 
---

The bloatfly larva syringe? 
---
I’m not home at the moment, but I’m on the the trenches there is a blue tarp over the top, with a stealth boy a skeleton and a yellow tool box. 
---
When I see someone is at the vendor I sit on the bench as well. The most I'll do is flash my light once or twice *just* to let them know I'm there. Most people don't even take that long. 2-3 minutes isn't that bad of a wait time IMO but for a select few I guess it is.
---
This is the wrong sub to ask that question as you'll either get cult-level praise for the game or literally worse than Hitler condemnations to spite the cult-level praises.
---
What has changed:
---
SOME bug fixes, but along the way, a lot more were introduced. You'll still get the occasional disconnects, lighting and animation bugs, and just plain weird stuff and enemy spawns glitching out.
---
There's a also a lot more real-money mtx added in the atom store.
---
The core gameplay has not changed, and there have been no new content added so far.
---
If you enjoy the core gameplay of Fallout 4, but online, you should get this to scratch that itch. If not, give it a pass.
---
Lucky Hole workshop has 3 acid nodes. you’ll be swimming in acid in no time.
---
The truth?
---
It's because in about 5% of them, there is something cool.  Be it loot or an interesting 'scene' with teddy bears, blood, and psycho.
---
My perception is max. What then?
---
I think theres a fine acid mine near the pleasant valley station 
---
Ok I know that spot, with the skeleton in a tire holding a skull. I find random stealth boys and mini nukes but never encountered a plan, thought you might be talking about a different spot. RNG working against me again!
---
I have a three story open air mountainside mansion almost impossible to get to on foot, and cannot be seen from the ground.
---
Just pick the card and press unlock
---
I thought I was clever when I figured that out.
---
Harper's is more reliable to be honest. If you clear the whole town there's at least some 1* lurking around but I've found a few 3* there. Also seems more likely when there's scorched, not mutants there. Fort Defiance I run a lot looking for coloured nurse outfits and legendaries are fairly rare but have always been 3*. All have dropped 3* items too, not 1* or junk like seems to be the case at Whitespring. I forget the name but the nuclear disposal site that's east of blackwater mine sometimes has legendary ghouls outside it too.
---
Wait is that a workshop?
---
My wheel has been frigging reassigned spots, removing others. It's all mangled when it log on &amp; gotta reset it.
---
And I thought having to equip grenades after loading was a bit of a chore... 
---
I played last night for the first time in a month or two (busy life).  And it was glorious to have 800 storage space, which I almost immediately filled up.  Also now I know what plans I do and don't have, I instantly spent all of my caps buying plans.  Then spent the rest of the night grinding for caps.  It was absolutely beautiful.  I want to hop back in again.  
---
Thats a great idea
---
Ps4.When u go straigt to downstairs of golfclub u have to kill invisible ghouls like 2minutes by hitting blind every direction.
---
Where do I go to unlock it?
---
it’s like center of top of the map. there’s the golf building and to the east is the workshop. takes like 10 seconds of sprinting to get there.
---
I don't know much about pvp as I don't partake in it. I will tell you though that the "oh shit" factor goes through the roof when you walk into a place at level 23 and see a level 68 scorched conqueror just chilling and then attacking you.
---
On your pipboy press which ever button opens the perk selection menu then if you have unused perk points theres two option pick a new card or or Speacial respec, pick the new card option and find whatever card youre lookikg for and unlock it
---
I tend to build out my camp and I'm a sparse decorator. 
---
If I want more decorative stuff I'll start eliminating smaller out buildings.
---
I also use zero turrets. Turrets use way too much space. 
---
Yes 
---
What r the stats
---
This is a dumb idea. It's dumb in ESO and it'll be dumb in FO76 if it happens. It takes away the whole point of leveling. Why have levels at all if you're just scaled to everything.
---
&gt; I'm not angry, I'm just calling out the insane amount of cognitive dissonance around this subreddit. **I was never banned**
---
I didn’t say you were. Why would you feel like you need to deny it? Ohhhh. You did get banned. LOL outing yourself for 100, Alex.
---
This is brilliant and your dedication to making these crazy ideas work in this broken shitshow of a game is incredibly admirable. Well done.
---
HEMLOCK HOLES workshop. sorry for the confusion!!
---
Likewise, it doesn't seem to effect West-Tek any.
---
Thanks
---
Its an RPG feature to have the ability to accidentally run into monsters that you're not strong enough to face yet.
---
Gotcha.  Dang I was really excited that there were three acid nodes at luck hole since that’s like a 30 second jaunt from my base!   
---
Regardless, thanks for the advice.  Headed up north I guess. 
---
Nope, pets that can be aggressive are always, unconditionally aggressive.  Even to teammates.
---
I’d buy that for a dollar 
---
I have not. The death claw is always visible for me, behavior is normal (from what I would imagine). Just a lag in the middle of the fight almost every time, although it may be dependent on the server itself and not the death claw battle.
---
I'll buy it for 600 caps
---
&gt; I didn’t say you were. Why would you feel like you need to deny it? Ohhhh. You did get banned. LOL outing yourself for 100, Alex.

What are you talking about?  I can log on right now on PC, you're just proving my point about the mental state of the people in this subreddit defending the game.
---
I have a heavy gunner build also and went to try pvping yesterday, I did a search after I kept getting my ass kicked and heavy gunner looks like it’s the worst PVP build. I think I’m gonna have to start picking some melee cards so I can actually do something to people besides miss 25 shots lol
---
While the CAMP can act as a stash for the owner of it, it won't function as one for guests. Still best to put a stash box out for passers-by. 
---
 Instigating is the bomb for that gun. I have about 128 on mine with a Hardened Receiver. So that's 256 on a full Health hit and 512 on a Sneak Attack on a full Health enemy. ;)
---
I have situations where I am randomly getting hit by something around white springs, specifically the golf course, but it usually will only be a one or two hit situation at max. Then it just resumes as normal, no ghouls around at that point.
---
Was the ammo he did that with untracite? Because Bethesda said that is the only ammo they are watching for. Due to it being considered "rare".
---
There is some basic guidelines when providing proof. 
---
Chopped recordings are suspect by default. You could do anything during that chop.

When you run an experiment you don't decide to leave out 6 hours of data because too little was happening.

That idea is rad as hell.

This is actually very nice. Thanks for sharing.

I built my camp just a little northeast of Watoga, one of those multi platform and stairs jobs, but the primary goal in making it was to be able to jump off the top into a waterhole. Occasional molerat visit is currently my only problem. Come back from a SBQ fight, process my junk, make some flux, jump in the water, play the piano, and have a snooze. 
---
Events AND keeping like two Workshops will get you there even faster I feel. It at least was my route
---
Valid point. Any time I have ever tried to set up an area for people passing through though they have always taken the opportunity to grief me. I used to set up a foyer in my house with a chem bench, cook station and stash box, just so people could scrap and cook and make stims or w/e, but I would come back to broken walls and picked resource collectors. "Your CAMP is under attack"
---
It comes out in a few days, so ***at least*** one 1 MB.

It's a pain in the ass to build there.

I'd say two minutes is too long if you're aware that someone else is waiting.  I mean, ideally, you should have some idea of what you're selling before you get there.  If the problem is that you're wheeling-dealing trying to afford something you just saw, maybe you should keep more Caps on hand.
---
Actually if you check out his email, it flagged regular ammo too. Besides, there were a lot of claims that crafting ammo, cooking food, or farming nuka colas was doing it. Duper lies I call those
---
U can get to level 30 with a new character in a few weeks..if u didn't really like the current build of your main character I would start over
---
&gt; There is some basic guidelines when providing proof.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Chopped recordings are suspect by default.
---
There is literally no way to know how long it will take to get a ban email, could be a few minutes to over a week as someone else pointed out.  If you are recording on your phone it isn't sensible to record past when logging into the game, that is just retarded to even imply.
---
Except for 900 hours guy, this doesn't prove anything unless he has been doing it with untracite ammo. Bethesda has already stated the only ammo they check for is "rare" ammo which they only consider ultracite ammo as rare. 
---
So props for the guy testing, but if he wants to test issues with the 900 hour guys story he needs to do this with ultracite ammo, not common ammo.
---
I was wondering this the other day. Until I came across a Nuka Cola machine in one and started cracking up. Now I won't ever stop opening them!
---
Unfortunate as hell. I've yet to be properly griefed but I've generally kept my base off the beaten path best I have can. I did have it leveled by an orbital strike once though (stupid river area east of Whitesprings is way too popular).
---
Currently I've done as you've mentioned, a workshop foyer then rank 3 locked door to the inner sanctum type setup. But unless people are being very respectful, I don't think the frequent my current place.
---
Just figured I'd toss that stash info out there, discovered it while transferring items between accounts. 
---
In Fallout New Vegas, Knock Knock was hidden this way. Have been opening stalls ever since
---
Hold on I'll grab 900 guy's email to show you they flagged 5mm and 5.56 too
---
Let it go. U will eventually get what u need if u stop searching. (Old Chinese saying)  ;-)
---
You know how AGI affects crafted durability (I think) I wonder if luck affects chance to learn a new mod?
---
Nope they list his amounts but clearly states he was banned for the untracite specifically.
---
It tells you how long in the challenges 😉
---
Wasn't really searching for it, just haven't seen one before so I was wondering if it was rare or not.
---
Right.
---
The game doesn't make this very clear, but prior to Lv. 50, the Perk Card and the SPECIAL point are two *entirely different choices*.  You can take a Perk Card for Strength, but unlock a point in Perception.  You can swap the cards around whenever you want.
---
After Lv. 50, you just get cards.  No SPECIAL points (but you can re-allocate one SPECIAL point each level if you wish).
---
Hmm. I’d try out both. Pretty sure the furious explosive has not only higher damage on the opening sniper shot but furious will ensure follow up shots, if needed, will be even better. 
---
I got curious so I calculated it. They’ll do the same damage against 300 DR, which few enemies have and probably none have higher, and anything lower the furious explosive comes out ahead. This isn’t even taking the Furious into account, or if you have tank killer, which will grant a bigger benefit to the weapon that isn’t already piercing armor.
---
And I didn’t even include if you used Demo Expert, which will add maybe 12% more to your outgoing damage. It won’t be much after calculating vs. DR so I didn’t include it.
---
Not so, his main account got flagged for just having the Ultracite but the second account had the rest of his ammo. Why would he need the other ammo on his main account?
---
He only claimed any of those things prior to Bethesda email because he had no clue what caused his false positive. The email layer states his mules ammo numbers but the ban email specifies only his ultracite ammo as the ammo that caused the ban.
---
"Because you never know what's ~~going to come through~~ behind that door."
---
After the house bugs in Skyrim, mannequins make me so uneasy lmao
---
I would still love to build them, though. Just plop a camp down and throw 30 mannequins up.
---
Having scaling doesn't necessarily negate having a leveling system. And it shouldn't, really. It just narrows the range of what you could expect to go up against to something reasonable.
---
Because let's be honest if you're new to the game or lower level; it gets tiring really quick not being able to complete a low level quest because level 100 player XXTinyDick69_XX walked through the area a few minutes ago leaving you to get constantly ganked by enemies that are 20/30/40+ levels higher than you. That kind of thing is horrible for game balance and really fucking off-putting to lower level players.
---
Might be easier selling it/ finding what you want  on the  fallout 76 market sub or the bazaar sub 
---
Right, it flagged his main account where he kept only some of his Ultracite. His other account had the rest of his ammo. If they hadn't had been looking for it, it wouldn't have been flagged
---
Never found one myself either. I usually did a Whitespring run every night but figured it’s a total waste of time. 
---
Who cares what communists think?
---
So no mods then? Guess there is no hope for this game after all
---
What do you mean? The email clearly states the reason he was banned was the amount of untracite ammo only. The other ammo wasn't mentioned until the second email from Bethesda. So if it was the other ammo thst caused the ban why was it not mentioned in the original ban email?
---
Or at least putting platform
---
Quite happily gambling on the Xbox version before sinking even more cash into getting my PC capable of running it.

No, Tunnel Snakes do.

It's a simulation of post apocalyptic life.  Life doesn't have an endgame.
---
I just threw a random, short wait time out there from off the top of my head. My entire point is that people that immediately go to stab you when you are in the middle of your vendor trade are rude. My stabbing encounters are of people who just spawned in or walked up and want you to move right away. I also want to make it a point that I'm not sitting at vendors for however many minutes. I just go in, sell my witch costumes, and leave.
---
No it didn't he never had that much ammo. Bethesda has a horrible way of counting things. They will count thi gs multiple times. It is easy enough to prove. Go collect wood scrap on a new character then put it in a suitcase and see what the wood count on your achievements says. Then pick the same sood back o and it gets listed multiple times in your achievements. Same issue with ammo
---
I mined Lucky Hole earlier in the week, and walked away with 444 lead ore, FAR more than I could use. I smelted about 300, and got back 1200+ lead scraps.
---
Slow down a bit at vendors and you'll never sell anything you don't want to. If you put Flux in your stash you won't accidently sell it. I also happened to learn this the hard way.

Had some strange things happen at whitesprings today. Golf club was full of robots so reloaded the game and it was full of level 9 ghouls. I’m level 91.
---
Do you have a general idea where this is? Haven’t come across it yet! 
---
It is better but still has a long way to go until is considered playable. At the moment you can probably play it for like 20-30 hours without major problems. After that it becomes frustrating as f*#^
---
Pretty sure you do not need to 'block' with a melee weapon for blocker. Ghouls end up doing more radiation damage than melee damage when I use blocker.
---
I've never played a melee character in a Fallout game until 76. It just seems a tad bit overpowered here and my survivability is way higher than when using guns. 
---
That is the second email, the original email they sent when he was hit in the ban wave only stated ultracite ammo.
---

I got a Medic’s pipe gun recently. Level 20 so kinda useless. Later I got a prime automatic receiver plan for a pipe gun.

Power Armor Plan Missing
---
Kidliquid01 - Xbox One
---
I bought and learned the Power Armor station plan. I built my armor station in my base, but now my "Known" power armor plan is missing and I cannot build another. It's as if I never had it. 
---
What platform?
---
i've only gotten two, myself. Both one-star two-shots, oddly enough. pipe pistol and pipe bolt action.
---
Not really
---
I die a bit more as a melee build but only because I play far more aggressively. Also the game doesn't really punish you for dying.
---
I have been playing a sniper/stealth build as well and have been thinking of starting a new character to try either melee or a melee/pistol build. 
---
It sounds like it would be a lot of fun. The melee/pistol build would be with the the Order of Mystery questline.
---
Why the fuck should I keep playing then
---
Amen. Its terrible design in a game with open world MP.
---
Its totally fine in an SP game where if you start seeing high level enemies it means you need to back off from that area for a little while.
---
Yeah, Instigating is fantastic against most enemies with the high-alpha rifles (gauss, hunting, lever). Line up the headshot and you get another 2x on everything.
---
Anti-armor's better against Scorchbeasts though, as the first shot doesn't do enough damage. Not sure about Furious, as it depends what happens when you miss.
---
Not saying you should...
---
I'm using the Blade of Bastet from that questline and I feel extremely over-powered in the Forest/Savage Divide and Ash Heap.
---
Here's the build I'm following - https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/https-www-falloutbuilds-com-fo76-planner-aw4abweicasbaqea/
---
No good loot tables. No end game. High level enemies are boring bullet sponges. No new content. I'm also passing.
---
Interesting. What kind of armor do you wear? I'm thinking blocker is not very beneficial if you have sentinel pieces already.
---
I am having a shotgun/ unarmed build, but i am also getting a rifle build atm.  Melee makes things easier tbh. But i dont wanna be a fulltime melee player.  I had a heavy  weapons  build at start, but i like to change from time to time.  
---
And then it was linked to a second account that showed 5.56 and 5mm. Why would they mention those amounts if it didn't concern them? You're not making any sense
---
Same here, my usual system is as follows...  
---
Find nice legendary weapon, learn schematics, craft a shitload, and deck it out proper.
---
I always scan the front of the stalls for tension triggers like FO4. Just habit I guess 😂
---
There is a location far south in the savage divide where you can build both a lead and acid extractor. The problem is it is next to a fissure so you have constant scorchbeasts attacks to worry about. It also requires you to move your camp multiple times until you can find the right height to power both extractors. The acid is in a cave at the bottom of a cliff. The lead is on top of the cliff above the acid.
---
I would, instead, recommend taking Hemlock Holes far north for acid while having a camp far south in the ash heap by Hornwright Site 3 for lead and steel.
---
Good grief, this was totally it for me. I'm used to Bethesda being buggy AF, but this was next level.
---
Strange, my first clear was with melee as well, didn't break anything.
---
My instigating gatling gun does 132dmg, which scales really well with the sneak crits. I can usually twoshot the Mr. Gutsy's in the silo, all other mobs are a one shot. 
---
Xbox1, first time I’ve ever encountered it, then it happen twice in 10 minutes.
---
 I have of course 3 Tank Killer but yes. I use it for them as it hits so hard and I can hip shoot the suckers quite well. I will not use VATS. It takes a while nut I do shoot into the wing roots and get em' to land fairly well. Then they die. ;)
---
Right, and INT I think effects how much scrap you get.  You're probably onto something there.
---
You can buy them at the watoga shopping plaza I believe
---
If you can manage to place your camp higher up than ground level, it will increase the max roof height, up to a point. Try placing camp on a ledge, pile of rocks, tree, etc and check the results.
---
Hahaha!
---
Take over workshops, you get atleast 1 plan every time you take over a workshop, you also get 1 plan every time you defend a workshop.
---
Sometimes it takes me a minute just for the vendor inventory to show up.
---
Something like this?  
---
[https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x34fgk9](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x34fgk9)  
---
That doesn't sound remotely right. Why were the boats still going to the islands? Why were they consistently not coming back, or coming back but mysteriously without their passengers? How could the Greeks forget the concept of trading (a key part of their society) but not oversea navigation *to* that island?
---
I spent way more time looking into this than I should have and found no evidence that anything resembling your statement is professionally accepted.
---
I wear weightless for my chameleon mutation. I sit around 200 ballistic resistance. I do not make it a habit to get hit very often, but when I do, blocker and lone wanderer do a great job of keeping me alive against melee enemies.
---
If you are going to be face tanking a million mobs, yeah sentinel is probably your style.
---
A lot of those stats are in the Challenges tab. 
---
I'm considering putting a prime receiver on the one I got. I have an automatic receiver on it, when I spec for stealth commando it passes the West Tek check.
---
I'm addicted to alcohol, and can't seem to get rid of it (because I don't have any addictol left, and neither do my friends).
---
Addictions are working fine for me on PC.
---
Anti-armor is a flat +29% HP damage against anything significant. Furious maxes at about 30% nominal damage (or +43% HP damage) after about six hits.
---
The mechanics of Explosive are less well known and probably bugged. I think it adds another 20% of explosive damage (24% with Demo Expert 1) on top of the normal ballistic damage. This might not benefit from headshot or stealth bonuses. Against humans it seems to ignore armor to some degree and deals heavy limb damage.
---
I feel like bad enemy leveling system design/ bad leveling system design in general can be a huge issue no matter what type of game. 
---
It's just that it becomes even moreso of a very pronounced issue when the game is a multiplayer or an mmo. Because with multiplayers and mmo's you do so often have that really wide range of player levels and skillsets.
---
If you’re doing it for the survival challenge, it’s bugged. It counts everything but the melon 
---
How much of that is Bloodied? If you have any idea
---
Same. I'm not sure what your results are, but I seem to get a prime plan every 6 or 7 SB's.
---
Think it’s the cat and the boat etc. the rubbish ones... you can’t get the “modern art” ones at all.
---
There aren't any concrete walls. There's Metal Walls, Barn Walls, Warehouse Walls, and Brick Walls.
---
Just read this post and went to Harper's Ferry for the first time. And... got the plans on my first try! About 1.9k from the vendor. I am lvl 33 right now. So lucky!
---
For real. You shouldn't even be able to sell the stuff you're actively wearing. And any weapon in the Favorites shouldn't be sellable, either. 
---
I started melee builds recently in Fallout 3 and NV and they are ridiculously OP. Planning to do one in 4, and also am slowly speccing into strength points in 76, chiefly to better use my combat shotgun, but by level 50, I plan to move over to a sneak-critical melee build.
---
No, reread my comment. There will be mods, on the private servers that Bethesda hosts. No offline mode, but mods are still on the table. 
---
Don’t forget wood walls!
---
Wow this was almost two months ago lol.  Anyways if you go to the steakhouse they have a giant garden outside with plenty of melons 
---
Exact same situation.
---
Main is a stealth sniper, go to play style for FO4 as well. Think she's level 127, mostly using a 1* Gauss &amp; 3* Lever Action. Like you said weight is always pretty high, I'm happy with about 100 weight when I go out to do stuff.
---
Enter the one handed melee character. 35 pounds on average. Think level 17 right now. 
---
But the biggest change is sheer damage output. I'm not using anything too fancy atm (Black Diamond) but most enemies are 2-3 hit at this point. With the main I was still having to go for sneak headshots to accomplish that in the same level range. I'll be a bit nervous if I see something 10 or so levels higher until I drop it with nary an issue.
---
Plus the difference in play style revitalized my interest in the game. Ain't too much for me to do on the main at this point but hit 25k caps. 
---
I had 4 in strength and one rank of the one-handed perk, and my Blade of Bastet felt very very weak at around level 20. What am I doing wrong? Do I need full Strength and more perks to make melee that OP in 76?
---
I know but I’m saying that it won’t count as you picking up a melon. The challenge is bugged 
---
You can look at the CAMP machine and it will tell you whose camp it is. 
---
 I put mine away when I discovered daggers. I carry ... about 6 Combat Knives and Cultist's Daggers now. They are real light.
---
 Was fooling around near Top Of The World tweaking the Moleminers in that camp. Killed most of em' with my Lever Action and went down to see if that had anything. Stabbed a couple that were left.
---
 Then a couple of level 30+ guys showed up and set off a horde of them. They were being careful, but for me it was a gift. had the whole horde of pretty high level ones come for me. Stabby stabby and they are all dead in rather short time. They got a few bullets into them and came down to loot and one of my loots lost a couple of caps to them. I thought it was funny but mutteered about killing them for their perfidy. I guess they had their ears on cause they ran. I was just joking. ;)
---
I actually managed to buy one at Watoga train station 🙃🔥
---
Lol that first email doesn't mention what got him flagged at all
---
Do you use power attacks? I pretty much run straight at a crowd of enemies and spam my power attack. I also put my first 10 points into strength.
---
Concrete walls = using concrete foundations and the campfire glitch to place them ontop each other.
---
You are better off getting shotgun or melee cards to swap into. PvP with heavy guns doesn't work so well since it's usually a game of who can one shot the other first. Otherwise heavy guns are only useful in team PvP engagements.
---
You have to plant it yourself at your base and harvest it and it works 
---
I guess lack of strength is my problem. Strength 4 doesn't cut it, I guess.
---
Deathclaws gonna deathclaw 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Yeah exactly.
---
I can make you serums, xbox1
---
A gunslinger / one handed seemed like the most logical build to me; shoot them then stab 'em when they get close. Up to L50 was very efficient and i thought it was good until i started seeing what the Wasteland Wizards do with legendaries.
---
One thing i still don't get - why choose 1 hand vs 2 by the #'s? I guess knife is super fast but there is little difference. Seems like there are fewer legendary drops for 1 hands / pistols, even rifles.
---
Another build that will change things up for you is Gun-fu! My gunslinger these days can headshot an entire crowd of scorched in seconds, but i've read that automatics can do it better. Pistols get lower VATS cost but rifles can do it too. The plasma flamer might be ridiculously good with this.
---
So while the heavy hitters are working on the Queen a Gun-Fu can clear all the surrounding critters, fast.
---
Wait there is such a thing??
---
Damn, you're right. I've already logged off though, hopefully I'll see it again, I think I may move my camp next to it or nearby 
---
Well, originally you were specific with the kind of scaling (player scaling to enemies), and now you back tracked to a generic scaling.   
---
Yeah, it depends on what kind of scaling you're talking about. Scaling enemies to the player doesn't necessarily negate having a leveling system, but scaling the player to enemies absolutely negates a leveling system.  
---
Scaling you to enemies doesn't "just" narrow the range of what you could expect to go up to; it makes the range exact. The player knows exactly that they'll never been in a situation they shouldn't be in. The whole game becomes static.  
---
I'd be on board if you said that the enemy scaling system needs some refinement. This is reasonable, as maybe there are situations where a high player X causes too many high level monsters for low level player Y. Although, just because this happens time to time,  doesn't mean we need to nix the leveling system all together. This just nerfs the game into oblivion. "So-and-so had a tough time so let's just remove the feature all together!"
---
And you need to be able to teach them tricks.  
---
**~~WHY~~****?**
---
As said all plans are available everywhere now. But you also can get handmade plans from the prison quest.
---
Because all you need is a dog. Literally nothing else matters.
---
I need Dogmeat in Appalachia. :(
---
I get them at about that rate as well
---
Thank you for doing this, I don’t know why some people are hell-bent in spreading rumors about the game, but thank you for adding some truth back in 
---
I forgot all about demo expert perk. Right now I have all three rifleman perks maxed out. Tank killer and bloody mess maxed out. So it sounds like the explosive is the weapon to go with over the anti armor. Plus the furious explosive has the 90% weight reduction. 
---
Never saw that. 
---
I will pay real money for a glowing ghoul skin AND a sarcastic robot companion who carries all of my junk. 
---
Real money! 
---
Take my money Bethesda! 
---
IDK trying to find your soulmate? 
---
I would love to get the instigating version. Rng hasn’t been that giving to me though. I’ve gotten a lot of legendary rolling pins and wood armor. 
---
I have some vague ideas about trying to build on, in, and around a broken down bus if I can ever play without getting distracted long enough to look for one on the side of a road with the open side door facing the road.
---
I'll show you a *real* Tunnel Snake.
---
There is a section of the golf course that nothing spawns on and is patrolled by bots and is outside the normal nuke zones, it's basically heaven if you don't mind your base not spawning in alot, it's too I think the south west of whitesprings.
---
 I bought it from Wallace. A max level Instigating Lever Action for maybe 350 caps. Could not believe it, and felt sorry for the guy who obviously did not know what he had.
---
Idk, my bff Jill?
---
Best tip - WhiteSprings Pagoda Fountain heals disease.
---
Always press L3 before cooking / crafting - sorts active choices. Sort armor by weight, food by spoilers everytime you log in.
---
Contractor perk INT = 1/2 cost for repairs.
---
Super Duper perk LUCK is amazingly good for ammo, smelting and nuked flora. 30% of the time double the amount!!! Must have!
---
Scrounger / Pharma Farm - press a button to do an extra search, same as with a few quests to earn the rare anti-biotics.
---
I just got an exp smg a week ago from a legendary robot 
---
How do you know it isnt intended?
---
I engage people contantly. Literally its all I do. All different types of engagements. Fair or unfair. Workshops, your camp, my camp, whitesprings slap dmg.  Wutever. Its fun to fight players. NPC's are weak and boring. Sometimes you gotta attack low levels to get thw "bounty hunter" white knight type to attack you.
---
It really bothers you guys on reddit tho. 
---
Ill change the way i engage when they change the rules. Ill def be playing in survival when it launches. 
---
No mean spiritedness on my end. Im just a guy having fun PvPing on his favorite game engine after work. 
---
Bloody melee 5/5 3 star cavaliers. 
---
My build/gear is complete. I nevwr bothered doing any quests... Its not my thing. Still gotta do the first overseer quest lol. 
---
I did the quests that grant rewards i wanted tho. Just enclave and mayor for a day 
---
Im mic active too. So if someones bitter about their camp being smashed, ill invite them to mine and show them where it is. Ill even stay in a server if someone wants to nuke me. For roleplays sake.
---
I like how uve been following me around on reddit tho. Are you mad that i disagree what constitutes greifing? Do you want my ign? Im on pc if you wanna "teach me a lesson"
---
You can tame animals, there's a thread about it around here somewhere. 
---
Harpers ferry vendor has the plans. It's where I got mine when they made them all available with the one patch. I was lvl 120 at the time
---
Harper's was worth the time for me.   Thanks again for the info!
---
Do you really want a dog in a game where someone else can shoot your dog? Think of all the people who have come home to their pet sloth/deathclaw being killed. 
---
I couldn’t play with dogmeat in Fo4, the first time we went out something shot him, he laid there in the middle of the battlefield crying for help, I ran out stimmed him back, and took him immediately back to sanctuary, and to the doghouse, the wasteland is no place for a dog as great as him! 
---
If they make them invulnerable, they will also have to be completely passive which honestly wouldn’t be that bad, just have them run and disappear as soon as trouble starts and then just shown back up later.  
---
I’ve fantasied about making this before.  Never thought it was possible to tame and KEEP a deathclaw.  You’ve raised the bar.
---
When will people get that 900 hours guy was just a cheat? His numbers were ridiculously suspicious, and many other player with high item counts did not get banned for them. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ax6ll8/bethesda_should_fix_pvp_its_not_fair_to_those_of/
---
Maybe this will help. 
---
Maybe you don’t know the game much.At Lv50 almost everyone can afford crafting a full suit of X-01,plus completing the enclave quest line to reach the terminal containing the X-01 schematic.Asking for 1000 caps by selling the suit is just fraud.
---
Also my comment is like that because I believe most players understand the fact.But I guess some of us are just inexperienced and rude.
---
Fine, but anyone who cuts in front of me in line is getting shot. Any vendor who walks around me to get to someone behind me is getting shot.
---
 And yeah, some of y'all take too long. If you advertise like a shop then run it that way. If just  you're just making private deals then don't advertise 'the store is open'. 
---
The sprint power attack is a 1-hit KO for most enemies I face. With the exception of high level Scorched and Super muties the blade of Bastet is a force to be reckoned with. 
---
I however started with Melee/One shot rifles (lever action is a beast) and want to try other builds. Thinking of trying some heavy Gatling next!
---
Proof that the Dev's planned camp companions since the start, but redditors will still congratulate themselves coming up with the idea. *sigh*
---
Why thank you, that does help.
---
had this happen to me, I finished it and it wasn't in my quest log and I never got the next one, where the warden sends bounty hunters after you
---
Not sure I will ask 
---
Seeing this put a huge smile on my face. XD
---
I was going to make a thread compiling some great FO76 videos. I'm going to add this to it now.
---
still looking?
---
I don't think most players understand that fact. Guy is just tryna sell armor and you're being pretty condescending with a 'heh no'. I'm p sure the only inexperienced and rude person here is you.
---
What would actually have been constructive was if you sent what you sent to me, to him instead first. Instead of responding to someone calling you out.
---
Wow man. Talk about one hell of a deal. I’m gonna have to look that dude up on the market. 
---
Take a radx as soon as they start trashing your base. That will surpress your mutations. So no pvp unless you want it. Doesn't stop the base destruction though. 
---
You don't need the code pieces, just the code. You can find the decrypted code on the nukacrypt website. I'll join if you are still looking for people. gt is newt341.
---
It's better for sure. I still have issues, but I'm on satellite so I get what I get lol.
---
3* Scorched Cricket Piercer in a nuke zone. Can’t see it, by the time you do it’s in your face and one shots you.
---
So I'm guessing it's probably a bug?
---
I've heard the Wendigo cave is good also. The mirelurk Kings are sometimes legendary, and the final Wendigo is always legendary (I think, not confirmed). Could be worth a peek into.
---
I’d really like some other comparable areas to whitesprings if only to spread people out a little more, nowadays there is ALWAYS someone staking out the golf club, even if it looks like it’s empty, someone is there.  
---
I like to jump in, kill everyone for a quick roll at the legendary lottery and then I grab the golf outfits.  But when I pop in, there’s always someone that was just crouching and waiting. It’s even worse when it’s a nuke zone, there’s always a team in there doing their thing, I realized yesterday if I walk up really close I can respawn the mobs for that crew and then let them take care of that while doing the entire rest of the circuit  alone. 
---
that's what I figured
---
 Its worth checking the vendors in Watoga, Harper's Ferry and at The Whitespring and the Bunker. They often have stuff people are getting rid of, and amazingly good stuff shows up sometimes.
---
Oh yeah facking Duncan. A real hero.
---
I’ve gotten on from the SBQ. I see everyone saying it and at least I can confirm because it actually happened to me.
---
You first. Dont waste my time. If you dont know, dont reply. That's you being a "dink". Here, have another trophy. Just as useful.
---
Determined to shoot an orange cat with one and hear Garfield.
---
whether or not you believe it is separate from it existing. it is certainly better than "because I think so" which was all it was originally.
---
Both recipes are fir sale in the medical wing of the whitespring bunker
---
Learned something new today. Havnt tried taming  pets in 76 yet. Good to know.
---
Oh ok thanks!
---
Lower CPU clocks than X as well as a sub-optimal memory arrangement means the OG Xbox is almost always the worst performing console with multi-platform releases.
---
Unfortunately Fallout 76 is no exception.
---
Yep! Yah harvesting in the game only counts when you plants crops in your base and than grab it from there.
---
Awesome thank you 
---
True, but you don't have to buy/find the plans for 'em.
---
Harper's Ferry usually has 3-5 legendaries or none at all. The common wisdom seems to be that any enemy encounter has a chance to spawn a legendary so any place with mob density in higher level areas  can be good.
---
I'm also convinced the frequency of legendary spawns are tied to servers, the amount of times mobs in a given area have respawned due to players, and time. Regarding the last point, I had a few days where 3*s consistently spawned for me at lesser discussed locations like the Atlas Observatory, Dyer Chemical/Crevasse Dam, and the Sugar Grove parking lot although they've since been inconsistent. Most likely just RNG but it sure feels like some locations have higher spawn rates on certain days. 
---
Nukes and/or player density/proximity also seem to play a large factor. Watago always seemed to spawn more legendary protectrons after someone nukes Fissure Prime so I suspect that it's due to players passing through or the nuke affecting nearby areas outside the actual blast area. All this is purely based on my own observation so take it with a grain of salt. Astral alignment may play as much a factor as anything else. 
---
With all that being said, I'm bored to tears with farming Whitesprings so I usually just do big loops through the Savage Divide, Mire, and Cranberry Bog to hit up a bunch of spots. I'll stay on the server once I find one heavy with legendaries and repeat the loop so the cells have enough time to reset since legendaries always respawn in the same spot (excluding random encounters). Hopefully you can make use of some of my *hot insights* and get the wood armor of your dreams. 
---
I'm currently running a small little two room motel to the west of the snake image, near the last of the greens of whitesprings. No turrets, everyone is welcome, the garage is full and ready to use, with two weapon, armor, and PA stations. There's a small med bay in back with the chemistry bench, and out on the porch is two cooking stations. 
---
A small farm, and water open to take. Nothing is locked, and most always never has to be repaired. Thankfully havent had any problem with griefers. On PS4, anytime you see it, don't be scared to stop by, and stock up, going to soon be setting up a storefront with it too, for the player vending arriving later.
---
With how sensitive people are now. You can get someone communication banned on xbox or suspended over literally anything. I told I guy once who got butthurt in pvp duel in dark souls to "git gud" got a week comm ban for it. I even told xbox support it makes no sense and it's just gamer trash talk.
---
They said we support gamer trash talk but this wasnt. It's a joke now.
---
Additionally. Get some melee defence perks.. Otherwise said melee guys will one hit you.
---
Things like dodgy. Blocker. And serendipity. Maybe a card for administering stimpack at a low health level.
---
Also look into sentinel armor if you can.. 
---
Maybe a good idea to submit as a bug. I believe I've had this happen too, lost my X01 chassis one day. It did just as you described. A server not responding twice then a server disconnect. It was right after I recalled my x01 and got in my excavator. Logged back in and x01 chassis was gone. I know it wasn't me as I don't hit any keys when I deploy armor, it's always a mouse click. Makes a bit more sense now, the fusion core at 0 may have caused it.
---
I was under the impression the dupers were crashing it. Good find!
---
If your strenght is down to 2, you can barely crawl around. 
---
The problem is that with the "scrap all" not working right, people (me included) scrap it while manually racing through a huge inventory of junk. Moving it to miscellaneous would make it impossible to accidentally manually scrap it. 
---
This is great. Just great
---
Thats super amazing. I’ll keep an eye out for that. Thanks. :o)
---
I am selling a top tier one on Xbox 
---
And suddenly a massive number of bodies appear in the wasteland.
---
Yeah right now I have a six story skyscraper, with a nice view of Morgantown from the side of a mountain
---
What platform are you on?
---
How much damage?
---
I've just tried again with only my alcohol addiction and it stayed.
---
Now that I think about it, I've got the bug only when I was addicted to Psycho, which I've got when injecting Psychobuff and Psychotats after spamming regular Psychos.
---
I will try to record it when I find the right chems again.
---
Sorry if I've spreaded misinformation, guys...
---
It’s not as sexy as the others, but I got a Quad homemade, and it makes the magazine so large reloading isn’t a thing anymore, I think I have a 80 round clip, and I didn’t even have to go for the high capacity magazine. 
---
Thanks. Didn't know that was a thing. 
---
Kill assaultrons. 
---
This is exactly my current problem. I used to run the "line in the sand" event at lower levels (30's) and got some cool stuff (fat man, gauss rifle, etc.) But now I don't even bother because I don't get anything good.
---
P.S, Western revolvers are cool, just not at the cost of a lvl 80 creature.
---
One or the other or both?
---
For Acid you can do worse than the hills between Arktos Pharmacy and Gauley Mine. My first real home base was there for probably the first 20, 25 levels or so.
---
For lead there's a spot central to the map down at the bottom of the divide range west of the Top of the World and east of the White Powder Ski Lodge. There's also a friendly neighborhood deathclaw who likes to knock on your door to borrow a cup of sugar every now and again, and that's kinda nice.
---
But my favorite spot is just north of Huntersville. It's pretty  central to Whitespring and Watoga and the R&amp;G Raider Trader in the south. Great for minimizing travel expenses when doing vendor runs.
---
But both, together? The only place I know of like that is down south just north of Lake Eloise. Supposedly you can place a camp in between those two nodes and get both but I've never done it plus it's extremely close to a fissure site and frankly it sounds like hell having to fight off a Bravo every time you head home just so you can double dip on resource allocation.  
---
Yeah, that one never completes. My guess is this quest will continue in the future.
---
it's the [yellow flight helmet](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Yellow_flight_helmet_(Fallout_76))
---
I have a day one edition Xbox one and i haven’t had any issues with crashing since the updates started to come out.
---
And ridiculously easy headshots.
---
It's a flight helmet, i found one in a gas station.
---
There's a really nice spot with 2 broken down buses running parallel, with a small gap between em. I've been considering building there. I like the bus build idea.
---
Not when being an asshole to people is the supposed rules they are breaking to begin with? 
---
&gt; It's less killing your local drug dealer and more catching proof they're a drug dealer and reporting them to police with your proof, for example.
---
That would be reporting them and moving on. What you are doing is either vigilante justice or entrapment
---
I feel a follow up video next week may be in order to prove he remains unbanned.
---
Darn... You’ll come across them. Ive gotten a number of drops, two shot, explosive, bloodied, anti-armor etc.
---
166 without any perks for it 
---
Yeah I had to go without most things
---
Though, I think it looks great. I love the cave. And 9/10 times I spawn on top of the cliff.
---
I know the last one says, overseer logging out but not for the last time. Or something along those lines. The one found at the B&amp;B. Just curious is all, tired of seeing it in my to do list. lol 
---
Never encountered one of them. 
---
Yes. I run around in a hazmat suit and if i'm not careful those guys fuck me up
---
As an experiment, fast travel to Harper's Ferry. Curious if your Xbox stays on.
---
Anyone on xbox have the ability to mod the torso?
---
I need it added and am willing to pay
---
Assaultron Blades.When you scrap them, you get one.
---
Be careful though, I'm pretty sure "Scrap All" will break it down into its components.
---
I listened to all holotapes after I finished my nuke launch including all journal entry's and even found a duplicate alpha site holotape log when someone else nuked whitesprings.
---
I want a cat.
---
Red Deads Calling you.
---
I wouldn't recommend eating Plans. Try squirrel on a stick? 
---
Dude...
---
It does man I’ve done it many times for the enclave blast events 
---
Well if it is... how do I get it?
---
Wait. Why are there Western Revolvers in Virginia?
---
I totally agree about being board with Whitesprings.  Thanks for the info!!
---
In found that roach in the house near the Nuka factory! I accidentally knocked the top hat off before I got a picture. Made me sad.
---
If you're talking about the golf club - it's really hard to count them all, but if you get enough ash piles on the ground, you'll see less and less spawns
---
Wow, that makes way more sense that a bug was showing the back-end uuid for the user instead of the “pretty name” version!  I see those users from time to time and I was trying to figure out why someone would name it like that, even if it was a second account or a mule, why such a long as weird name?!?

---
I don’t remember seeing a body, so I think there’s a good possibility that she’s still alive. 
---
Then how would you play the game?
---
I have a nice little structure on the river. Outdoor workshop, 1 small bedroom, a back porch looking over the water and enclosed generators. The only thing is its completely out of the way and it's expensive to fast travel anywhere lol
---
True, but it couldn’t have gotten much worse, could it now?
---
Sure, look for it tomorrow.
---
Strange. It appeared for me just once. Ever. Way back in January after one of the updates.
---
Would be a good way to display clothing or outfits too.
---
I think you and I camp in the the same place 🙂. I’d like to make a pen to keep the brahaim safe. 
---
Lmao 
---
Price?
---
I’ll keep an eye out. Thanks for the info. 
---
This wins Reddit today. Heroic accomplishment!
---
I've tried to keep in-line with the lore, and have settled on a concrete and steel complex with a hint of warehouse materials to bring out that utilitarian/industrial feel. Can't wait to decorate it with the junk I find 😁
---
Stopped by to see if anyone had posted this. I found it at the Lewisburg station. I did the powering up event twice and it wasn't worth 190 caps for me to do it a third time. 
---
Personally, I use the Lever-Action more than the Handmade, so it's my personal choice, but nothing can be "missed" anymore.
---
r/market76 
---
I think so too. The game is still fairly new. So maybe we'll find out later. Who knows?! 
---
Not it shows resistance after. You will notice that piercing magazine weapons affect it.
---
Seems we are in the same neighborhood. I'll stop by if I see ya!
---
 I used to just shoot, explode and kill stuff till I discovered my daggers.
---
 Now I arrange it so I can leap into the middle of a pack and murder them all from inside it. So much quicker and I take very little damage. ;)
---
Wait for the new game modes before starting a new character, IMO.
---
In fallout 4, if you bring Deacon with you &amp; do a top to bottom search at every location you get some very unique dialog about being very through. I loved that. 
---
Also feel it wouls help the game feel more realistic and improve the game economy 
---
4K 
---
&gt; West Tek check
---
Hah, I do this too.
---
How is stealth commando? I keep getting nice items for it and stashing them. Was thinking about starting a character for it.
---
Not guaranteed, but keep checking harpers ferry.
---
When I first read the headline i didn't realize it was on the Fallout sub, and I thought, "Yeah, weirdo, why do you open every bathroom stall door?"
---
You are right, even the hemlock holes that everyone is telling you to go to, it doesn’t produce enough acid to even smelt all the gold and crystal it itself produces. 
---
I’d recommend just taking the location, I take it every day and nobody has ever cared, you, me, and the other guy in this thread are the only ones who care.    I load into a world. If HH is taken I server hop, otherwise build it up and go back to the game, show up every once in a while and get your acid.   Worst case if someone takes it from you they can have it.  
---
Also that area spawns snallygastrs and Grafton monsters, just killing them while waiting for the extractors can often give just as much if not more acid 
---
Agreed, just like the skyrim Mannequins.    Lock them to players like power armour so visitors cant take the armour
---
I mean I can see them hit me and unstable isotope triggers. They trigger it cause the game registers them as an enemy due to their bounty. Idk what else to tell you.
---
this video popped up in my suggested list last night, easily your best one yet. concept and sound track were top notch :)
---
There really isn't a way to reset vendor, is there? 24 hours between checks is pretty brutal. I've been after this stupid mod for weeks.
---
I just started experimenting with it this weekend.. But it's really good! Heavy on bullets though!
---
It wasn't even my base. There was some random camp they located and then they went to whitesprings to troll. 
---
I open every stall and port-a-potty just because I know behind some of them is going to be a teddy bear doing something whacky! 
---
Just “in-track” it in your data section of the pip boy... no more to-do list clogging ;)
---
I think I saw it at Pleasant Peak Raider vendors.
---
Didn't see which sub this was from and got kinda confused for a sec, what posts I have in my feed.
---
Quiet
---
Ya just switch servers, you wont reset the caps though.
---
Anthem actually isn’t continuing to plummet. You can tell by the sub. It will be on the rise one a single issue is fixed. Notice when the game first came out it had a plethora of issues, now the one and only problem is loot. When they fix it (or leave it bugged) then I feel there will be little to complain about. That being said holy shit is there a lot of complaints about loot lol. 
---
Nice! I will give that a look!
---
I did the same lol
---
Mod or plans? Plans I've never seen but the two vendors in Watoga regularly carry chainsaw mods including the Chainsaw Flamer.
---
Could end up being a far harbor type of thing. 
---
I killed 3 at once and got nothing of value lol
---
Hmm. That still works? It always comes up the same for me. I'll certainly try it, though!
---
The answer? Just in case
---
Watoga ALWAYS has Long Bow Bar for me, never anything else. I'd love the plans, but would take either.
---
Yeeaaah the ammo cost makes me worried. But if I can make crit chaining work with it, the potential damage seems so good.
---
 ¯\\\\\_ (ツ) \_/¯ 
---
I would absolutely love a timer with stack count for adrenaline. Would be nice to know when it's about to expire
---
Because you want to sample the toilet water in each.
---
There might be a possibility to have guard dogs patrolling our camps instead of turrets, like the one dlc from FO4. Or even the ability to make Dogmeat wait/guard your camp while your out and about. Dog armor to upgrade the stats or just purely cosmetic. Lotta people would pay for a doggo after all. 
---
And every outhouse and port-a-potty
---
Switch the subtitles on and then even if a car explodes nearby drowning out the tape  you’ll still know what’s being said, that’s what I did cause some of them can be a bit quiet.
---
I have a bloodied hunting rifle lvl 50 I will sell for 2.5k 
---
Is that different than Point Pleasant?
---
Anyone know how long it takes for the Crazy Cat Lady's house to respawn the cat bowls?    And thanks for the suggestion! 
---
Somewhere in Post Apocalyptic Applachia is someone closing all the damn bathroom stalls after some random guy keeps opening them. 
---
I’ve never seen plans for anything involving the chainsaw. I usually find both mods at Watoga. If you’re Xbox I can look around.
---
On headphones they sound great. I second the subtitles idea
---
PS4, but I appreciate it!
---
Dogmeat in previous Fallout Games: "Hey look I found you some bullets!"
---
Dogmeat in FO76: "Hey look I found you 3 scorchbeasts!"
---
Yeah. I always play with my headphones on and it sounds pretty ok to me.
---
Somewhere with planes nearby, would be my reckoning. Airport, crash site..
---
I got plans to craft Prime Recievers for them.
---
For the life of me, i don't know why anyone would waste the resources doing so....
---
I’ve been checking every stall and ham radio since FO3 😭
---
You know for the longest time I wondered why ghouls and scorched fought.
---
I use to play them against each other.
---
After hearing Lucy talk, feeling bad.
---
I wonder if Bethesda could make questline returning them back like they did in FO4?
---
There’s a whole city of them in valley Galleria just trying to live in peace.
---
Reminds me of those leper’s colonies you read about as kids.
---
I do hide them until I'm ready to do them. This has just been bugging me. Everyone says it can not be completed and I'm determined to prove them wrong. 😂😂 but I'm beginning to lose hope. 
---
the fuck is wrong with you
---
Er no it’s the same. Ski resort place, right.
---
Im struggling to remember what game actually had this, where you had companions unless you played multiplayer and then they weren't available.
---
I feel like I see this mod practically all the time (at Watoga I think). I could snag one if I find it. What does it cost?
---
Because somewhere, sometime we’ve all either found or watched someone find some memorable legendary loot in one of those decomposing shit cans and now we can’t even glance at them without wondering “what if” to ourselves. 
---
I have an instigating explosive crit fills faster pipe pistol.  It's pretty sporty.  Wish it was a lever though. 
---
This is because we are playing a modded Fallout 4. I wouldn't get your hopes up at present.
---
Ahh right right. Pleasant Valley Station?
---
Or blowjob scenes
---
Trouser snakes rule  
---
We're the trouser snakes
---
whitespring has a ton of crimson.
---
That's what server hopping is for.  I usually have to since I need to use a plasma thrower to survive clearing out the golf house and have noticed some goo piles stick around indefinitely.
---
Not my intention to disservice you though.
---
It has been so long since I last saw it, I honestly don't recall.
---
I'd say ManyATrueNerd as well.
---
Brick would be your best bet, since the interior walls are plastered/decorated. 
---
I'm always willing to come back to the game, but what have they actually added that wasn't fixing existing problems? genuinely curious
---
i will gladly buy it, when are you available?
---
Dang I only have 800 lol
---
It’s like opening a loot box. Sometimes you find crazy stuff. Once I found an entire Numa cola vending machine packed with Nuka Cola Quantums inside a stall. Sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you get shit, literally.
---
Oh, totally! With a legendary Angler or Gulper, lol.
---
I've had it happen a handful of times on the same level 42 legendary ghoul that can spawn in the parking lot at white springs.
---
That sounds great! I only have 1301 caps so could I give you that and let you pick a few plans I have? I have a lot of prime reciver plans and other stuff like that. 
---
I could trade some guns or something.
---
There's ballistic fiber scrap in the porta potty at camp venture :) I always check
---
If it’s not too crazy, I might just grab it. I prob won’t spend too many caps on a mod for a weapon I don’t use.  But if you have a # of caps you’d be willing to spend, I can see if I find it again
---
With the 800 caps.
---
They also sell the mix recipes. I’ve seen Bufftats there as well.
---
I’ll keep an eye out, I need as many chem recipes as possible
---
2 words... toilet chems
---
I just looked. I must have given it away. Sorry. 
---
Jug is awesome. Also SoldierModeLife has some really good stuff, gamermomover50, Decoysdungeon. Tons.
---
I’m always afraid strollers will blow up, so thanks for that as well Bethesda. 
---
Where?
---
What weapons do you have?
---
I would check both the station and bot Resin up in the resort.
---
Love MATN content. 
---
I forgot about that guy hidden away in there. I will check both!
---
That's roachy, the Finals Pams husband
---
It could be an event on Blennerhassett Island.
---
I still want to open a bathroom stall door or porta-potty and get the jump scares that I got in FO4..
---
The happened to me today! Over 400 caps worth of bulk stolen! Wtf
---
scare crow is a lure device
---
It's Belly of the Beast. You should get what looks like just a power armor chassis. It's actually a complete set.
---
Anyone of them have tip vids or review or is it all just fun. I'm already subbed to some of them but I'm looking for a Utuber for fallout 76 tips and tricks and weapon reviews because I'm new to the fallout series and would like to understand the game a little better
---
I thought they were packed full of nutrients.
---
yeah you thought this was funny to post ? i hope you fucking lose everything you love
---
Hers an upvote for your well thought out and obviously misunderstood reply.
---
Also vodka is automatically consumed if you pick it up
---
I don’t think it’s really meant to be played solo. But I still enjoy playing on my own but luckily I do have friends who play. 
---
It's only OK, in my experience - I personally stopped farming it.
---
There are 3 Mirelurk Kings and it's fairly reliable that one of them will be legendary, but I've noticed that if one of them is then the Wendigo is a crown only. They're too much trouble to kill for the chance, tbh.
---
FOMO
---
To bring you free meat.
---
It's the saddest thing ever but dogs turned against humanity - for good cause; we destroyed the world. I can imagine the vibrations from any generator triggering their aggro. There is even a sound mechanic that draws enemies.
---
Bet you didn't know that or appreciate it.
---
What confuses me is why you pacifist types don't just team up. That's the logical purpose of forums, not whining @ Beth on reddit when they have official forums. No one should pander to quitters who won't make the tiniest of effort to be interesting. Cobra Kai, never die!
---
If you thought about this a bit deeper your argument should've been "why don't they attack all buildings instead of just players," but you got to admit it's effective. Just like perk cards - swapping it takes enough time that it is incentive to role play.
---
RP examples include finding safer places. Even on cliff faces, tree forts, and underwater. Everyone else is RPing and finding creative solutions to reasonable amounts of confrontation but you want Bethesda to do for you what you can do for yourself.
---
More wisdom getting down voted , having class in this day and age is frowned upon 
---
Can i make memes with this pic?
---
Was that you at that truck stop? #metoo
---
Ever since beta I've had a basic platform on foundations with the necessary workbenches, a bed and turrets all around. Nice and simple.
---
Worst part is people played THE SHIT out of it the first month. Game was SHIT on review wise. BUT now that things have been stabilized and fixed no one wants to try it again. I'm sorry but if you expect a game to be perfect on release your kidding yourself. Even games like GOW and RD2 had major bugs  first week/week and a half. But on the other hand It took way to long for them to fix alot of things.
---
I’ve had it happen to me too when doing one solo, you just have to make sure you have a team with you in the server to be able to join back in.
---
Or I could give you a two shot Gatling gun along with the caps and plans
---
Still broken for me sadly. It only activates when my health is below 10%
---
lol just like Rust
---
It is? 
---
How’s that work?
---
Do they try and attack the scarecrow? 
---
Does it spawn in actual new mobs, or is it just a high priority target for local mobs, like a generator or stash box? 
---
If I leave will I return to a pack around my scarecrow? 
---
Ultimate item:
---
TSE BB gun.
---
P.S, isn't the black powder rifle a beefy version of the BB gun?
---
Dump it all in the overseer's cache..  :-)
---
Funniest thing ever, I was headed to camp McClintock for ballistic fiber. Noticed a higher level player there during my approach. As I snuck in, I saw him drop a paper bag near one of the test areas and exit. I went to the bag, found an excellent piece of level 50 legendary armor. Guess it was his mule. I left my level 5 piece of crap leather chest plate in the bag and exited the server. Bet when he came back he was WTF....
---
It will.
---
I blame GoldenEye I do it and aim my gun into them.
---
Do you have a link to where you have read about it?
---
I'm still looking for the guy on the toilet with a bottle of hot sauce 
---
there are no “4 player raids”. Everything is non instanced. You could just not join the teams and walk around together anyway if you want 4 dog party. Seems way too game breaking even if the dog is cosmetic only. 
---
I'm curious on what the link is but don't want to see it as I'm using the jobs Wi-Fi.
---
What is it..?
---
I always check in the hopes of discovering a funny scene like in Fallout 4. 
---
I've never even heard of the next one.  That's mighty interesting
---
Us military throwing a live puppy off a cliff and u can legit hear the puppy cry 
---
Jug, MyUsualMe, Captainoob and Rifle Gaming have very informative videos on game mechanics. Jug focuses on base building, MyUsualMe does testing on some obscure questions, Captainoob has weapon showcases and build demonstrations, Rifle Gaming has nuke target location reviews. A little bit of everything, really.
---
Took a look at it. My only advice is that lifegiver in endurance is not really worth taking and by not taking those 4 ranks of perks it can help you reach your end goal faster. I think endurance in general is pretty useless except for radicool on a melee bloodied build 
---
No I just saw your two posts and frankly, its obnoxious the way you act. You know full well what you're doing is griefing other players, just from the reactions you get. You're not looking for a fair pvp match, you're looking for a match that you get to win on your terms with as little risk to you as possible to try and make others upset. Its cowardice at its best.  
---
The irony is you hate the "stealth meta" but use exploits to lower your risk. at least using stealth is intended, not you using the bounty system so that you can't lose caps.  
---
The reason I'd say your "cap condom" is unintended is because they're literally looking to pacifist to extend to your camp because of what you're doing. 
---
I like to build a tower. My current one is technically 4 stories. Functionally more like 3 with a balcony. 
---
I try to keep things simple and natural playing into the landscape versus against it.
---
I got DC’d two nights ago and I realized,  it was the first time in over a month.
---
Used to be it would happen AT LEAST once a week some times as much as multiple times in the span of a couple of hours.
---
The game has definitely improved stability and with the new content coming this week it should see a nice up tick in player activity too.
---
Just looked into the history of the island, and it was all pretty cool. It would be interesting if they were able to incorporate some of the events that happened there.
---
I'm not back-tracking at all I think we both just have different words for a similar concept. 
---
What I really mean is that first off enemy encounters should be instanced to the individual player. That would remove most of the issues with high level players causing high level spawns in the first place.
---
Then those enemies need to be leveled on a scale that stops at a set maximum number above the player's level. Just for example let's say that number is 15.
---
Under that setup; Player A who is level 25 encounters enemies. Those enemies would now be randomly spawned to be anywhere between level 1 and level 40 at maximum. Player A knows that they'll only encounter that max level 40 enemy at their current level. But with the leveling restrictions on weapon usage they also know that they could still very well be in for a hard fight if that level 40 enemy does spawn; which keeps things interesting without completely nerfing them.
---
*Walking around in my Scorchbeast skin shirt*
---
I’ll have to check but I know I have a Tesla rifle, fat man, automatic radium rifle, maybe more. I’ll be home in a few minutes I’ll check then.
---
Correct answer
---
They've been quieter since the last patch or so.
---
I'm the same way. Gotta find those teddy bears doing weird shit.
---
Press X to make friends.
---
I got the psycho recipe by defending a workshop 
---
I prefer to build off existing structures, but my current build has both lead and iron deposits for shotgun ammo. There is a sweet place between two busses with a working radio that I’m going to next, once I get bored of the mountains and have stockpiled ammo. 
---
Also, joining a team with a Wanted player should result in you also getting a bounty, either equal to your own level or their current bounty, whichever is higher.
---
&gt; A higher intelligence score will give items crafted the little white bar, i.e. over 100% durability. 
---
Also need to say you get more xp for each int point
---
&gt; The only benefit is the items last longer before needing repaired
---
It affects Power armor cores too
---
Honestly? if the deal is £25, maybe £30 max i'd go for it. I love the game, it's fun to explore, some of the quests have a brilliant story to them, encountering actual people in the game can be fun, but the frequency bugs pop up (at least for me) is worrying, usually they are minor and can be fixed with a log out and log in, or can be ignored in general, plus there are issues with the gameplay in general e.g such as spawning in nuke zones upon logging in (instant death unless you log out in power armor) or when you could steal someone elses items via the trade menu (this has been fixed since,but the fact that made it into the game and went unfixed for as long as it did was quite bad)
---
Nice!
---
Always a tower with a sort of church theme. No door so folks can wander in and pray to the Vault Boy in the center with a build-when-needed stair case so people don't prod at me while I'm sniping anything my scope lands on.
---
Not players though.
---
Usually always in the North. Damn Yogibears.
---
I always find some kind of goodies to enjoy in those porta potties! 😍
---
VPN's all day, brother.
---
There is a workaround you can do but its tricky and sometimes you have to move your camp multiple times if you mess up. It involves the single metal stair a floor tile and the beam. The stairwell can lock to the beam and then you can delete the beam floor and other stairs and the stairs just sorta float there. And you can build the house around them. But be careful because sometimes the floor and stairs can become dependant on each other and you can no longer delete them if you mess up placing stuff. 
---
As long as you do the initial part right though its pretty simple to replicate it. I managed a 4 story home. Technically. Although the last story is more like a roof access shack.
---
It's closer to a Sim of how **not** to lunch a game.
---
Ok thanx I'm subbed to rifle already but I will check them out
---
I still disagree. I dont greif. 
---
I use stealth meta too. Secret agent 3x
---
Stealth meta is boring but it's meta. Berry mentats baby. 
---
Here you are throwing mean words around. Thats worse than anything ive done in game. You should be more polite and understand some people have different opinions. 
---
I fight everyone. Why do you assume there are no fair fights? My gang and I are outnumbered sometimes. Sometimes were not. 
---
Ive never greifed. Which imo involves chasing a player into anothet server. 
---
You guys are just too soft and emotional. 
---
Alright thanks!
---
What’s an assaultron blade and where do I find them?
---
Cool. 
---
Ever since I played metal gear 3 I've done this 
---
I’ve killed a few and haven’t found one
---
I mean ideally they'd just fix the bug, but I don't have high hopes of that happening any time soon.
---
Pervert...
---
I open every door as well i also pick up EVERYTHING under the Sun then try to sell to vendors or give away free to other players.
---
I also try no to scrap anything because i noticed that at repair bench, it shows it'll scrap 1 clipboard and 1 handcuff for 2 spring to repair weapon.
---
As others have cited FOIRL (Fallout In Real Life) experiences like seeing a paper bag on the floor and getting excited, I am concerned. 
---
nice try todd
---
As my step douche would say: "securing the permitter" /chloe. Seriously I've been known to hide in them when I take a rest stop IRL, so watch your ass if they ever make those PVP I might be hiding in one waiting to cap your ass :D
---
What's your gamertag?
---
So weird. Watoga is LOCKED for me, but Haper's resets. Thanks for the advice! I haven't seen the Flamer mod yet but I'm gonna give it a hour or so of grinding and see what I come up with!
---
I do this too, in every Fallout game I've ever played!!!!
---
And not even the *good* organs!
---
If they make Pacifist full opt out, then griefers with kill someone, then switch to Pacifist to avoid retribution.
---
&gt; there are no “4 player raids”. Everything is non instanced.  
---
There are 4 player raids in the [roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019). both vaults are planned to be raids of sorts.  Not sure how you missed that. " For our most seasoned players, test your strength in all new high-level group Vault Raids ". Really bothers me you're acting so knowledgeable without even reading the roadmap. 
---
&gt; You could just not join the teams and walk around together anyway if you want 4 dog party. 
---
Except then you would be trading having a dog for being allowed to share perk cards, that when you're trying to synergize can be a huge loss.
---
&gt; Seems way too game breaking even if the dog is cosmetic only. 
---
I don't see how, if it was literally fallout 4 dog-meat, he doesn't do very much damage, can't tank a whole lot and while can't die, doesn't do anything useful when he's downed. Feels like you're trying to be contrarian without really having an argument. 
---
I played for 5 hrs last night and not a single crash! Also met a nice lvl 145 guy who took off my bounty for me and gave me fusion cores and ammo! And just hit 50!!
---
Items like this:  it’s what makes this game absolutely amazing.   I’d love if Bethesda would allow certain things like this on a server for like the month of October.  Something like a Halloween or Theater Bizarre type of thing.  
---
Awesome idea OP 
---
yea I saw the title and reported it, didn't watch it. some people are just monsters.
---
It’s all rng and these guys myself included just farm legendaries and events nothing else 
---
The spot for the random encounter that you mentioned will generate multiple event types including the dead trick or treater who carries the witch costume plans. Plastic + cloth = cheap and easy-to-make costumes to sell to vendors for a good amount of caps. 
---
There are multiple spots where this can happen, for example the highway 65 sign on the map near crevasse dam.  You can do a bunch of sever hops to see the different types of random encounters. 
---
For you shotgunners who are constantly on the lookout for plastic, I find it easier and quicker to just sever-hop at a spot with low-level scorched who carry shotguns. Each one-shot kill with a pistol or melee will yield 6-8 shotgun shells. Morgantown high school and Camden park are good easy spots for this. Bonus is that Morgan town will occasionally actually have some plastic to loot. If I remember correctly ten server hops at Morgantown high school will get me 300 to 400 shells. I usually do this when I am listening to music and having a drink or two at home. 
---
Ever since discovering that the unique axe in FO:NV is behind a stall door I open every one.
---
Cool, thanks
---
Does that even work now if they hit Revenge?
---
Yea, but they just hang out in your camp. I want a doggo that comes with me on my adventures lol.
---
Unless it's been patched in the last patch all community testing has concluded it doesn't boost damage at all. Might be time for some more testing.
---
Just pets in general would be nice. A dog. A mole-rat. A giant rat. A radroach. Like... anything I can talk to in my lonely journey. 
---
Yea. I have to review my build.
---
It looks like u are fighting the 1* legendaries 
---
They will also sometimes drop Ultracite armor plans, so they're worth the 5.56 to me.
---
Are u PS4?
---
Melee weapon. Serrated sword. Random loot.
---
When I need it, I look around the northeast corner of Watoga.  They are scattered around tables and things.  Used to be more reliable, though - I think many fellow dog food eaters know about this and pick it clean.
---
I have a 3* pipe bolt. Nocturnal, explosive and something I don’t remember. I never use it. Forgot I had it until I saw this post. 
---
Would be funny if Bethesda made this an in-game costume. 
---
You can move mannequins around with explosions...just blast one on over to your house! :)
---
Haven’t seen a legendary at West Tek the last couple days. Did they change the appearance rate there? Usually i got atleast 1-2 3* mutants there.
---
In that case, you should probably back out and try again.
---
I've found that when the vendor does this, it's often because it's in the middle of updating/resetting its inventory.
---
One day one day..nice pick up
---
Looks boring. Just regular 3x3x3 box build, nothing amazing.
---
I take it you’re on Xbox?  I have an anti-armor level 50, but I’m PS4
---
I dont play FO76 anymore, but when I did and when I play through FO 4 I always do this too just because of the cool staging Bethesda places in their level design.
---
Yeah I’m Xbox.
---
Or (in FO4) plungers. Just plungers everywhere. 
---
I think it periodically respawns in the overseers chests scattered about. 
---
Ok thank you 
---
So are you interested?
---
Ahhh, I was unaware of that caveat, I just assumed they'd rock around with with you.
---
Naw man I don’t think so sorry
---
Dang ok 
---
Really good video on disproving that crafting normal ammo could result in a wrongful ban. 
---
However, if I may play devil's advocate, doesn't the ban hammer refer to 100,000 "rare" items? I feel like at this point we all know that if someone simply claims to be banned from crafting too much soup or shotgun gun ammo is most likely lying. The video here echoes this as well. However, as much as I know there hasn't been any clarification on what is considered "rare" and I don't think shotgun ammo would under this category either, so while the video does disprove that normal ammo I don't think it rules out that you can get banned from crafting other items too much. 
---
I'm not defending 900 hour guy, but more frustrated not clarifying what's "rare". I do appreciate the work put in this video, because now we can't definitely rule our regular ammo has a bannable offense. 
---
I'm sorry, I love the design of this game.
---
I have 2.5k caps now 
---
I've definitely found it at Watoga since that patch.  I agree that the "Chainsaw Long Bar" does come up a lot (actually Chainsaw mods in general are way too frequent at those vendors - it's a completely useless weapon).
---
I bought it on a whim, not entirely sure if it was for the chainsaw or the Flamer.  Of course, it's the former and a novelty more than anything else.
---
Between Nuke events I farm the Top of the World area for plans and make runs through the Mire.  
---
Most of my 3* have come from a lot of Nuke event farming but some have come from finding 3* enemies in the wild.  
---
I got a 3* one shot explosive 5.56 assault rifle from a 3* gulper near the Mire power plant at around level 110.   I found my 3* TSE hunting rifle from a Nuke event in White Springs at around level 130.  
---
In other words, if you play the game enough, eventually you will find cool stuff.  The alternative is just to cap farm and buy stuff from other players.

I'm an equal opportunity feral ghoul killer. No star, one star, three star, I kill them all. Is there a way to spawn higher star legendary enemies?
---
Lvl 50 wendigos drop more/better loot than SBs. So do behemoths, hermit crabs, and mega sloths. On trip though WS golf club is easier and tons more profitable than fighting a single SB. Heck, I’d rather farm the lvl 10 grafton monsters in Charleston. So either SB needs to be easier or the loot table upped significantly. If it’s supposed to be an apex predator, it needs to drop apex loot.
---
SIRE! I WILL BUILD A LABYRINTH TO HOUSE THE DEATHCLAW!
---
Depends on what the upgrade is I guess?
---
I still have never seen a chainsaw. Never ever ever. 
---
It looks good. For endurance I’d take a perk that has a regen on something. Either health or rads.
---
Wish I had your luck. Over a dozen kills and not a single plan dropped. And I’ve taken down a few of the diseased ones in the bog. 
---
oh me too..I'm just saying the  majority of your legendaries are 1*.. I'm hearing watoga and west tek have a lot..I mainly stay in WS..but had 2 or 3 3* weapons (nothing really phenomenal) but good 3* armor..I haven't tried West tek yet cuz I heard being in a team is recommended 
---
There are ways to make them quite effective, but I do agree they need a complete overhaul and are completely bugged. 
---
I have a unused perk thingy what do I do
---
I have one of the best gaming PCs possible and I still play this on console 😆
---
It's the Yellow Flight Helmet and it is linked to the Atom Shop, but I'm not sure it's ever been publicly available from it.
---
Grognak's Costume was the same way.  It showed up in an Atom Shop image for another item before it was released.  A great deal of Atom Shop content is already done and present in the game, but hasn't been unlocked for purchase.
---
They don't drop as loot and only appear in four locations, and only the level 20 variant. 
---
Where are those locations?
---
Right thank you 
---
But really... don't be an egg... change your icon.
---
I think west tek is quietly the best 3* legendary farm. If I’m really trying to play the lottery I’ll just repeatedly hop there. It’s smaller, and I can clear it much quicker.
---
Yes, very much so. Also, nice to know when I need to rebuff Cancer Bat Stew, Banjo Power, etc.
---
Probably just rng, though I just did a run that had NO legendary what so ever.
---
Nope. I'm playing on PC
---
Last night I had a run at west tek that had several 3* legendary enemies, so I don’t think so, it’s purely chance.
---
Ok otherwise I'd give u mine
---
For every 3\* legendary farmed there is a literal mountain of 1\* legendaries left in the Ice Chest at Whitespring.
---
Lol yea I guess it kind of is! What if the made a lever action bp? That would be sick 
---
Ok, then it’s probably just bad luck. 
---
SoldierModeLife has a good video on the locations. One is a B&amp;B, another a Ranger Station, one is in a really hard to spot location near Top of the World and the other is Clarksburg, I believe. You'll want to see his video on the locations, as well as how to actually make the weapon viable. 
---
wat new game modes
---
Ok thank you
---
What if he bought goods on market76 at fair market price and they were duped. He had no knowledge of this. Should he still be banned?
---
This post got all the downvotes which I completely understand. I'm not at all trying to bash the game, I just hear what everyone else hears and sees in the reviews for this game. I want to give it a shot but I'm scared to drop $60 to 'give it a shot' when there's other games without the same reputation that are safer bets. I completely understand that this sub is going to have a special place in their hearts for fo76 and I hope you guys do enjoy it, I'm not trying to take anything away or give you guys a hard time. I'm sorry if it seems that way. Some insightful comments, thank you for your feedback. I'll keep looking into it or waiting for a sale price. 
---
No problem. He has about a million videos so I figured I'd save you the search:

would it be the one i asked for or is it the one with single goggles attached to the sides you can find at the ranger district office?
---
Borderlands 2 conditioned me with shitter steamer chest.
---
&gt; Here you are throwing mean words around. 
---
No-one here was born yesterday, you know that you're being an obnoxious coward, and pretending to play the victim is just pathetic. They aren't "mean words" they are "factual descriptions" of your behavior.
---
&gt; Ive never greifed. Which imo involves chasing a player into anothet server.  
---
Sorry man, most players consider what you're doing with the "cap condom" is griefing, regardless about how you define it, the popular opinion is what you're doing is considered unintended, and at least in poor taste. You can move the goal posts all you want, but for a majority of players, using bounties to reduce the caps you can lose while breaking someone's shit is considered griefing. 
---
&gt; You guys are just too soft and emotional. I have no intentions of upsetting people. I like to pvp, gank people, shake em down at their camps. Threaten to smash decon showers unless i get 20 stimpaks. Stuff like that. Raiders gonna raid. 
---
Again, this loses all of its weight of "I'm just role playing" when your doing it for the game function that you don't lose caps. Also eat shit with this whole "Im not looking to upset people". What you're doing isn't new, you know exactly the response you're getting, and you're clearly seeking it. Being bait for angry people with the intention to troll them is just as bad as being a flaming troll, just the way you do it makes you come off like a scared child.
---
&gt; I'm just the most challenging enemy you meet in this boring empty wasteland. You guys should be thanking me. 
---
No, you're the most obnoxious, not worth fighting enemy in the wasteland, and that's including the SBQ. I make more caps killing damn near any monster than killing you with your 5 cap bounty for breaking my shit. It's not enjoyable for the people you're "roleplaying" with, because it stops being RP when you use game systems to negate risk in your favor with no RP reason it should. That's why even though I love to do pvp at workshops with people, when someone comes up to my camp and I hear even one thing break, I just combat log immediately. The game clearly isn't intended for you to have such an advantage as the guy breaking my shit, and I'd rather fight literally anyone else than some kid who's got a weird complex they've gotten from exploiting the average players misplaced belief that other actual humans wouldn't be massive dickheads for no reason.  
---
&gt;  The burden is on the pacifist to server hop. They are opting out. Not me. 
---
The problem is, there are a ton of players who don't understand what you're doing or why. They don't understand you're breaking their camp to get that advantage, and they also don't understand the pointlessness of trying to deal with a griefer like you. I might understand if I run into somebody that's as slow, unempathetic, and deranged as you that my best course of action is just to server hop because of how broken bounties are, but not all people have the experience with pathetic sub humans like you in order to learn this.  
---
Frankly, once they release survival, anything goes there. I still think that using your "cap condom" isn't a real strategy, rather an exploit (I checked, its not intend to have the interaction you're using it for), but aside from that do what you want, but in adventure mode, going to random players camps and just destroying the place in order to game the system and avoid losing any progress is always going to be cowardly and pathetic, but will also always garner little to no respect from the community. 
---
Lore reason: it's a pre-war bot.
---
Console? Are you using a disk?
---
Hit up Watoga. Take a stroll through all the buildings and streets. A good day there are anywhere from 5-6 legendary mobs of various *’s
---
If it really is an Atom Shop item, I'll wait until it's available. But the list of atom shop items I found on gamepedia seems to have some items in it, you can find normally in the game. Just like the Nuka World Greyser Outfit. Found it today inside of the Nuka-Cola Bunker
---
Oh ok
---
would be way cooler forusre.
---
I have both..u want the yellow flight helmet..this was in fallout 4 but it looks completely different in this game..actually..I was at that location U just described and I found the other (medical goggles) instead..I was server hopping there and it never came up but I was happy with the goggles..as far as the yellow flight helmet..I got lucky and bought it from a vendor after a player sold one to them..but u can find it (supposedly) at the ranger outpost
---
It appears in several lists of Atom Shop items.  Maybe they'll release it with a later patch or we just need to wait for the next wave of new Atom Shop items...

Oof i've been found out RUN

And when would that be?

It may be true I was careless but it is not true that is had no cost.

 It takes quite a bit of time to get the materials to upgrade the vault suit.
---
You home smells like human, you likely grow crops, and the sound and vibrations of your generators and water purifiers draws them. that’s why animals and scortch attack.   
---
Super mutants are smart enough to know that is a human settlement.  It’s their time, they are superior, so anything that intrudes on their territory must die....  simple as that...
---
Find an area away from spawns or in areas that are inaccessible.   Yes, there are safe areas, you just need to look. For example, build in the middle of a river or swamp (yes, you can place foundations under water), on a cliff, island, etc.  
---
Place a round mat on dirt then place plants around it (the plants will move with the mat) then move the mat indoors or set up a roof top garden. 
---
There are ways to make your camp safe from spawns, put a bit of effort into it and you only have to deal with an occasion repair. 
---
oh, thats fine
---
Then I need to do some more server hopping... Hopefully you're right and I don't have to spend Atoms if the helmet comes to the Atom Shop.   
---
I also found these Medical Goggles there. That's why I never went back there to see if I can find something different. 
---
If you re watch, a second before the scene, the mannequin’s head actually moves slightly. It always creeped me out to the core.

Has there been more than 1 ban wave? I'd think the last excuse he could have is that the ban system isn't continuous. 
---
Since the announcement of the legendary vendor coming up I've been hoarding light legendary weapons in my inventory. Just today I was actually surprised to see how many were three star because I never noticed they had additional legendary features.
---
make sure to check all the legendary drops you get because sometimes at White springs you get so many so fast you don't truly inspect them.
---
I actually just found at The enclave bunker a ghoul slaying TES single shot shotgun. I'm assuming they saw the title and never bothered to look if I had any additional legendary skills and sold it.
---
The teddy bears reading newspapers are my favorite. It's fun to imagine some hardass wanderer taking the time to dress/arrange such a scenario in a shitter before meandering off into the sunset.

I'm 14 year old and I play M rated games cause. Tbh I like action packed games with guns and gore. I Am a LVL 56 in fallout 76 and I never harass people.  Most kids play M rated games due to the content. I play M rated games cause their more action packed. Swearing, Gore, and Blood is common for a action packed game. I like games because of the adventures and dark background.  If you're a lil kid just don't be a squeaker and play good.

That’s hilarious and amazing 🤣🤣🤣

Turning in technical data always gives me a bunch, any event, safes in harpers ferry, flatwoods. Use pharma pharma and you will get a lot quickly.

It's certainly better, but there's still plenty of things that are still broken. The past two days I've put the game down because of game issues like eternal loot circles regardless of server I go to.

I was wandering around Whitesprings and 2 lvl 80 scorchbeasts rolled up on me out of nowhere! Luckily a high level guy helped me down them and got an Ultracite Fusion Core rec out of it!

You get more prime plans if you never read them. And it's something like a 50% chance to get decontamination showers if you never read it. I farm prime plans and decon shower plans on a new character who crafts nothing but ammo. I'm up to something like 60 decon shower plans now

---
Make sure you have some points in Makeshift Warrior. Makes your melee weapons last a lot longer.
---
It's not worth having anyways. 
---
To be fair, you did back track. In your original comment, you state a lower level player should never face a higher level enemy, and now you're making exceptions to that. Regardless, we don't mean the same concepts with different words. Your concept of scaling is a drastically worse idea than what Bethesda has already implemented in the game.
---
If you're calling for instanced enemies to an individual player in the open world, then we have a single player game. We can quickly assume this will never happen in FO76 as it goes against the games intended goal (excluding future instanced dungeons...). 
---
Next what you mention is pretty much a similar system to what we have now, but not nearly as clever as what is already implemented. What you suggested allows players of any level to go anywhere in the world and have encounters who's difficulty is based off of RNG. If this dreadful idea ever made it into a dev meeting then you can pretty much bet that the difficult encounters wouldn't be all that difficult, and you'd end up with players being able to go anywhere. Not to mention it ruins all of the world building in FO76. Some areas are supposed to have a tougher environment, and this is connected to the story.
---
Now, let me explain why the current system, while can be flawed, is a fantastic base idea that can only be improved. Fallout is an RPG, meaning it's a game based stats and finding better equipment for your character. An integral \*\*feature\*\* of RPG's is to have players come across obstacles that they can't handle. This makes the better stats and equipment meaningful when they are obtained. i.e. "Oh hey, I couldn't go to the bog before, but with these new perks and weapons now I can kick some ass!". That's a cool feeling in RPGs, and it puts meaning into the invested time of the player. If the developers were to away all of the leveling boundaries of the game, then players lose the meaning of their invested time. It would be extremely unfortunate if Bethesda took down leveling boundaries because a few objectively bad players were not able to follow the games rules, and repeatedly went to higher level areas they shouldn't be in.
---
As of now a high level player can go to where a lower level player should be at, and the monsters will only scale within reason to that area. This way the monsters scaled aren't too difficult for the lower level player. Granted, it may need some tuning, but this is a great idea. Now if that low level guy goes into a high level area, where an even higher level player is scaling monsters up, then it's the low level guys fault for being in an area he shouldn't be in. 
---
The current system allows the lower level players to have areas to build their character up and invest time to have the ability to fight in the stronger areas. The system you proposed would make getting better stats and equipment irrelevant. All of the content could be done with a small amount of time investment just as easily as it could with a large amount of time investment. Players like being rewarded for their time, especially in RPGs. Leveled areas are integral to FO76, and you'd see much of the player base leave if those went away.
---
Or he was just dropping gear that he didn’t need.  
---
I have level 50 pieces in my stash that are basically backups in case the game eats something.  Every so often I’ll find something better and I just dump old stuff.   
---
Usually I do this at a train station but sometimes I’ll take the new item to a crafting bench to mod it before deciding which to drop.  That could have been the case here as there are crafting stations at the fort. 
---
Remember, what you think of as special could be a weaker item for the other guy, depending on build and what’s in their inventory. 
---
A better analogy here would be buying a new car.
---
If I was a dev for this game and I saw your posts I literally would cry from how proud I am that someone took the systems and made something so out of the box and amazing like this. Legend

 As its not common I will look to my machine, it could use a cleaning. ;)

Same with the porta potties, might be a borderlands thing. Though sometimes you find a teddy bear pushing a skeleton down the hole.
---
It’s not advised per se because if you disconnect you have no way of guaranteeing you will get back on the same server again.

You can only fit so many skeletons in your closet before you have to start shoving them in the stalls.

Been good here. I had a memory issue at the queen a couple weeks ago where it would stall every once in a while. I narrowed it down to the bad stick of ram. I run 2T command rate and loosened some timing, not perfect but it's a hobo fix until I can find ram that won't cost a arm and a leg.

Where is this on PS4? Can’t find it...

Oooooohhhhhhh. You're THAT guy. I get it now. I retired my Xbox one x. Pc makes it look like a Barbie jeep.

I had a Blade of Bastet and one day it was just gone -- no idea what happened to it and I don't think I can make a new one (though my rifle build doesn't really need it anyway I guess).

Where on PS4? Does it show hours played on PS4? Thanks

Argh! I totally forgot that!

It scares the sh out of me sometimes. I turn around and he's right there. Congratulations!

If you did the main quest but never went to the vending machine and received your uniform because you just did belching Betty in power armor , how can I still get that uniform?

Day one Xbox here. The game crashes a few times while playing.
---
Yup that's what got me into it too
---
Yeah so maybe spare us the bad analogies on a thread about consoles. I have a superb PC too but prefer playing the game on PS4 Pro.
---
Do not full time lock pick. Grab Glow Sight in perception. Also consider using Fire Proof in endurance.
---
Say what?
---
I don't know on PS4 but on PC it's in the combat challenge list. I think locks picked might be in World? I'm at work and can't check. 
---
Oh man that made me fear my Xbox was about to die or something. 
---
Why does this have to happen in Harpers Ferry? The only Free States vendor is there, I need my 200 caps god damnit.
---
I didn’t know that! I need to do another play through. I had a hard time ever parting ways with Dogmeat to ever have other traveling companions for any length of time unless I had to. He reminds me so much of my dog who passed away a year ago at the age of 15. They looked, sounded, and acted so much alike.
---
Oooohhhh. You're THAT guy again. I get it. Lmao. I'll be sure to drop every post I see and drop a bad analogy just for you mate 😘😘😘
---
yep, so far that's all they have said other than mention of prizes.
---
Thanks so much. THIS is what I’ve been doing wrong. Just going for pure acid. Thank you so much.

Lock pick is not on full-time it's underneath so I know to take it and will look at fire proof now thank you

I wanted to keep mobile, so I built on [a tower on a single foundation.](https://i.imgur.com/VYTe5Op.png)

I'm really enjoying being so mobile in this game.  My base can fit pretty much anywhere, though I do try to find some water so I can drop some purifiers too.

Yeah thats no chill

"Hey everybody it's me, Roachy! Everyone's favorite tap-dancing roach!"

Why not just make your own and never worry about it again? 
---
First, buy the plans from the Medical Bay in the Whitespring Bunker. They'ne not cheap but not expensive either. About 5-600 caps depending on your bartering skills. Easily no more than a half day's looting.
---
Then acquire Chemist and Super Duper Perks if you don't have them already -- that'll maximize your crafting to an average of 2.3 stimpacks per crafting event. Then all you need to do is acquire steel (literally everywhere) antiseptic (also everywhere in the form of cleaners and solvents -- abraxo is your friend) and blood packs (available wherever chems are found i.e. first aid, mirrors &amp; chem boxes or go tick hunting and make your own). You can also buy blood packs from most vendors for ~40 caps each. Yeah, that's a bit much but remember you're paying 40 caps for 2.3 stimpacks versus ~80 caps for a single stimpack. You get 4-5 blood packs, 4-5 steel and 8-10 antispetic and you're looking at 10-12 stimpacks with barely any effort or expense at all.
---
Looks like a fo4 shelter

Thing is, op's story is misleading. He didn't swear over voice chat in an m rated game. He sent a private message, outside of the game, to another player through xbl which broke xbl's terms of service. The fact that it's a kid has nothing to do with his suspension. It doesn't matter how old the other person is, or what game you are playing, if you send another user a message that includes vulgar, threatening, or harassing language, and they report it, you get suspended.
---
As for finding random, and odd things in this game, does anyone know about the ‘ Port O Potty/Outhouse/Toilet ‘ that has a mysterious button inside? A button that is lit up and you can actually press ? I have tried messing with it but nothing seems to happen? I mean, why is there an accessible button INSIDE an Outhouse/Toilet?? 
---
Just scale to the map. Some areas are more dangerous than others. I don't know why they had to make it hard. When I was doing Rose's quests, I moved my camp to TotW for convenient quick travel.  I was under level 20, I think I had never died to that point. The next time I loaded a Scorchbeast ate me. Then I got killed by legendary wolves. Etc. I went to sleep safe and woke up in a war zone. It was stupid, I used most of my ammo and stims, and by the time it was over, everything I owned ended up broken. It took hours of scavenging just to get to where I could return to playing the game.
---
I’ve no clue, I don’t use Steam haha 
---
So this is advice from someone who has successfully completed the queen multi times. Plasma guns suck for the queen. The best damage happens when she lands and you melee her. Don’t chase her or it messes it up for everyone. Check to see if a nuke has been launched in the server if so change server then launch because double nuke messes up the server and causes extreme lag. To get her to land more often shoot her wings to cripple her. Don’t use grenades unless they are cryo to freeze her on the ground. Have a friend that runs bloodied build for massive melee damage
---
Or maybe a lot of melee PVPers are doing it better than you? From what i can tell if you dont have some god weapon (2SE got nerfed) melee wins the majority of the time. 
---
The biggest concern is the ability to Stimpak spam to cause a damage soak for weapons that deal incremental damage AKA almost all firearms, while melee weapons like the super sledge are an instant one hit kill (in full X-01 power armor, thats ridiculous).
---
IMO the only weapon that should ever 1 hit kill is the Fat Man launching mini nukes since mini nukes are heavy, rare, and canonically provide the most damage of any weapon in universe the player can carry and use. 
---
One possible solution is to nerf melee damage to not be a 1 hit kill, buff most firearms, and create a small cooldown on stimpaks to avoid damage soak spam. 
---
As the game stands right now you need a 1 hit kill weapon to even be able to combat melee, becauss they will tank through everything else using stimpak spam damage soak and kill you in one hit. 
---
This causes most if not all builds (what players spend hours fine tuning and creating) to be useless in PVP out of imbalance. 
---
Under the challenges menu. If you open the map and then push L1 to pull up the menu there’ll be a tab called Challenges. And yes, hours played is under world or social challenges i believe 
---
Its Xbox T H I C C
---
Like others have already mentioned, many of those stats are already being counted in the challenges. However many challenges are not working properly or at all for some people and if you reach the last stage of a challenge it wont continue to count your stats. First it would be nice to see all challenges working properly, but even then a separate statistics tab with way more stats being tracked would be awesome. 
---
If you want survival games play Subnautica, the forest and dying light. If you want a Fallout game, play Fallout 3, New Vegas or even 4. Buy Fallout 76 as a last resort. It still needs so much work. While you can enjoy yourself in it, it lacks way behind the games I mentioned at the moment.
---
Thanks for the tip, that's what I have done since my last comment, and it work perfectly! 
---
Open the map, press L1 bumper, Challenges.
---
If you wear power armor in PvP you’re going to die. Power armor is for defense from enemies, not players. Likewise, stimpacks spam isn’t feasible outside of PA. 
---
Melee wins if you don’t know how to fight it. A shotgun or heavy weapons build easily counters it. 
---
Oh yeah I have the All Rise and I melee’d the shit out of her whenever she landed and her health didn’t change. Or if it did, it was minuscule. 
---
However, the first time I fought her, I was able to melee and cause a piece of damage each time. 
---
Fuck thats amazing! Great drop! 
---
one step further...what about checking behind every "in" door you open? 
---
One of the bathrooms on the out skirts of the white springs resort is full of mine and grenade crates
---
Most of my camps have been just functional.  But I started watching a series on YouTube by gamerMOMover50.  She shows places that have buildings or other structures you can build around.  Now I have fun incorporating stuff already in the world, into my builds.  It's nice having crops already at a site, since they can't be destroyed.
---
Yes XB1, but not using a disk.
---
My understanding is that loot is instanced (each user gets loot as long as they tagged the kill at least once).  
---
Only glowing mass, stable nuked flora, and SB pieces in Nuke zones and legendary items aren’t.   It looks like workshop event loot is also shared after one of the updates. 
---
I didn’t think that caps are shared...,   In any case, caps are so much less than any loot you find.  
---
But yeah, they were stupid to flee.   With pacifist mode there isn’t much that you can do to them. A guy in a Nuke event was constantly hitting me with his mole miner claw and it just tickled.  He was able to one-shot glowing ghouls with it.  
---
I think I got it at 41 or 42. 
---
Then it was probably a bad server

Honestly, if I were in the wasteland, I’d do the same thing

PS4 by thanks for the offer
---
I was so confused and disturbed by this post until I realized it was in r/fo76.
---
Thank you for making my day, op.
---
Yeah that’s what we thought. It was just a bummer!!
---
[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ayeolg/things_that_need_to_be_fixed_before_open_pvp_in/) a post (it was deleted, but the comments are still there) where plenty of experienced PvP players talk about the balance of things in PvP. Most the PvP players seem to think spam heal is a crap tactic that just doesn't work. There's also quite a few comments where I detail all the counters for melee.
---
I’ve found numerous porta-potties and outhouses with poems in them! It’s amazing!
---
Do it with a friend. Since something changed which doesnt allow new people to join servers after a time (or playerbase is now stupidly low?) It won't retrigger the ghoul spawns.
---
If you have a friend, team up and one of you force closes the game, logs back in and it will respawn all the ghouls.
---
Partner and I have been intentionally waiting for the server to empty to take advantage of the lack of competition for ghouls.  So far worked 100% on PS4.
---
I can't imagine they cost much. I feel like Long Bow Bar is only 56 without any cost reduction. Let's judt say 200 over cost to a maximum of 300 a pop.
---
The amount of enemies in the cave is great, it just take awhile to navigate through.  I'm sure there is a easier shortcut, I just haven't found it yet.

I’m now 41

Glad to help, of course haul is variable depending on traffic. That route though nets me most of my daily junk needs. I grab hemlock, kill grafton monster and snaggles on golf course, hit the fourth acid pit, then the one up near crosshair. Then aaronholt farm for bobbleheads and some junk. Then my list above. It carries on beyond that but the rest is caps and bobbleheads. 
---
They are not loot pinatas.  They are area denial enemies who fuck with you as part of the main storyline expressing itself.
---
Now you know, since you seem to be pretending you didn't already.  Maybe you can stop wasting time fighting them and I will stop seeing these dumbass threads?
---
I would assume that backpacks will use the backpack armor slot, and will probably follow armor hiding rules, so outfits with no backpack will display them, but outfits with backpacks won't. Not sure how this would interact with the trapper chestpiece exactly, though I assume it takes up backpack slots as well as chest slots.
---
How much would you want for it?

I've heard if you stick to the left it is quicker (not sure though)

That's why I save this Dog Helmet.

I'm a solo players, sometimes i'll play an event or take out a legendary with a random player. Most players are pretty chill especially when it comes to this approach. One time while clearing out a factory of Super Mutants I shot another player in the face when he surprised me rounding a corner, thankfully he understood once i put my gun away. 
---
If you are into story then Solo or a very very good partner is the way to go. I had an online buddy of mine b-line to a missions marker as we were exploring. I like learning about the lore and the background about what happened. 
---
&gt; You get more prime plans if you never read them.

You'll also never get repeat Prime plans if you *do* read them.

I had tried to make a compound type camp in the bog but the walls kept getting busted down. Do you have the same issue or do you have some kind of solution?

Yea I spend like 10-20 mins killing adds and stuff to check the servers conditions fast travel go inside somewhere check load times if they seem lagged then I always switch servers
---
 I am about to roll out a new one ... and maybe its time. ;)
---
The cave is a new location for me.  I will try going left and see if that's shorter.  Thanks for the info!
---
I mentioned gamerMOMover50 in a different thread.  I like her videos.  I also recommend eNtaK.  He doesn't have a huge amount of FO76 videos, but he has fun with the game, which counts for a lot.
---
There’s a shed outside of big tunnel west (or whatever that tunnel is called) that several spawn at. 
---
Why not build a chest piece and put the mod on that? I've got modded legs and arms and chest pieces that I swap in and out depending on what activity I intend doing. Think I saw a posting over the last few days about serums on PS4.
---
Played for the first time in a month to help out some friends.   Ran into two sets of griefers killing people 200 levels below them.   People seem to be bored with nothing constructive to do.   So now that i helped my friends,  back to Anthem.

&gt; Not even Legendary. 
---
How to fix unrewarding Scorchedbeasts' loot: Give a legendary. Boom, that's it. Even if you get troubleshooter wood chest, you know that it was worth a try because you could have gotten something you like. Still not as efficient as Whitesprings but worth the resources, just imagine, legendary screeching loot with wings all over the map.

 I am going to go try out my knives on a fairly high level PvP guy when he has the time, as I want some experience with people who know what they are doing while being evil. ;)

Stopped using Dogmeat in 4. The injury animation went from sad to annoying quickly.
---
Remove that depressing shit, and I'm all for it.
---
 Yeah its been great. I guess its me, I did get 10 degrees or so by cleaning the cooler, so I'll try after I go visit my daughter.
---
A tiger would be awesome
---
Honestly just get Fallout 4. It's head and shoulders above fo76 in its current state and has some good survival elements. 
---
There’s a couple of mods that allow you to either have dogmeat and another one or as many as you want, that was a must download for me 
---
I would also love an option to “de-rank” perk cards. I accidentally made the silly mistake of leveling Makeshift Warrior up to rank 4 when I only have 3 Intelligence because I was so focused on wanting to craft/mod some of the cooler weapons like the power fist. 😔
---
Get the Man's best friend mod, it's available on both consoles as well I think and it allows you to have dogmeat plus another companion.

For some reason class freak doesn't take the negative down on herd mentality, at least not for me.  Generally I have heard mixed maybe slightly less than positive things.  I use it but 90% of the time I'm in a group.

---
Three times now I've been hiding and he comes up behind me.  Can't hide from the Prize bot.
---
I would pay money for a dog companion as well and i usually never buy microtransactions.

That would make sense, I just hope Bethesda at least takes outfits with backpacks into consideration to avoid graphic clipping.

---
Yeah i would guess it was probably just left over in the loot tables from fallout 4. What i'm hoping for is now that they have the game in a better spot than it was at launch in terms of stability and performance that they are able to start adding some really cool content now. 
---
I know the game had a rocky start but i fail to believe that it can't be turned around into something great, i just hope bethesda has the commitment to do it which so far they have shown that they seem to. If i see that they are seriously committed to support the game long term this might be the only game that i've bought microtransactions in.
---
The way I believe it to work is that they do not have ban "triggers" that activate as soon as you have the items. What they did and will presumably continue to do is run a cleaning script when the servers are down for maintenance to recheck for those large item triggers. They can be mass quantities of ANYTHING. Any type of ammo, aid, or other stuff will be flagged and they are continuing to add more items to ensure a thorough "cleaning". This is why they temporarily suspended these accounts with suspicious amounts until they can effectively wipe all of these mass items off the accounts. This will likely happen this week as I have heard rumblings among Bethesda employees about it being "very soon". I would guess they will be having a look at the account in the video here and take action accordingly. It will likely be a wipe of the ammo but there is no way to know. Hope this provides some useful information here.
---
+ 3 to all special stats is extremely helpful, as you can imagine, so you should naturally roll with strange in numbers. If you add up all the bonuses gained, it really is amazing. Playing solo hurts a bit, but equip lone wanderer and you'll be fine. If you use healing factor, though, it will glitch out. Healing factor breaks lots of stats. 
---
Maybe you can change it to one of the default ones, and then back to your horse toy? The game might think you haven't changed or even checked your default icon after one of the updates. If that's the problem, just change it and then go back to giddyupbutthing. That's usually how annoying tutorials work.
---
I don't even remember what you are talking about but it should stop as soon as you use the feature. If it doesn't, it's a rare 3 stars legendary bug.
---
I bought a 3* assassins handmade from a vendor today, about 500 caps. Not that I’ll use it but I’m collecting legendary handmades, got 5 so far, two of which I use regularly.. otherwise yeah, farming WS and nuke zones, Westtek

I'm actually under the impression that it's raider behavior. Notice how there are raider corpses pretty much everywhere in Appalachia? On top of the architecture designs they have, I think raiders were highly prevalent before the Scorched plague.
---
I can easily envision drugged-out raiders in a bathroom setting up dumb jokes like that.
---
Someone please tag the Bethesda employees. 
---
In reality, yours and mine are equally just as usable. Im just bored lol
---
I see it all the time at watoga.
---
Saw the mod just today at the Watoga train station vendor.   It does exist it's just a matter if rng will bless you or not.
---
Really? I guess I've just been super unlucky. Admittedly, I haven't server hopped to try an find it but I always check Watoga everytime I log on. 
---
It definitely unlocks at 40.  Make sure you have your filters set up right when looking, it’s in Perception. 
---
Norespawns does quality camp build videos.

I gave a gaming pc that is my super xbox because i play this game with my xbox one controller on my big screen at 60fps smooth. ALL OF YOUR XBOX ARE WEAK 30FPS. Sorry for the caps but just gotta lay out the facts that if you are noticing the 30fps stutter go get/build a gaming pc like i did
---
Being an MMO, I assume it's the breadcrumb leading to whatever's next.
---
MMOs just don't usually give you breadcrumbs before the expansion releases.
---
Nah the new xbox 1x still crashes alot. I even have to best internet money can buy. It's the game...not the xbox...not the internet...not the dupers...ITS THE GAME. 
---
I feel like this is the goal with that Nuclear Winter mode being released.
---
I started at launch and never had a problem with enemy levels. Usually no more than 10 higher than myself. Then I took a break and when I saw the roadmap I came back (yay raids!)... but this time I wanted to start over. Mob scaling is a HUGE problem for me now. Mandatory quest areas such as Top of the World were packed with level 70s that absolutely crushed me. It got to the point that I had to start real hopping to try to find a world more suited to me. All the bullshit comments below are elitist and just toxic in general. Just because they dont experience a problem, doesnt mean it's not worth fixing or isnt a problem.
---
What needs to be realized is that this scaling issue is scaring off NEW players. The people you need to build momentum in a successful game.
---
So, like I first said, I suspect that the new game mode will be aimed at high level players and have completely open level scaling... as opposed to limits in certain areas. While the traditional game mode will have some tighter restrictions put in place. Areas should be predictable... that's not to say that areas should scale to your level, but if its level 15 one day, it should be close to that the next... not fucking level 70.
---
Hahahaha, nice!
---
As I said in a previous lost. Just kill the bastard and take the steel/aluminum. Lol
---
Well I have not been blessed at all apparently lol. Thanks, I was starting to give up hope on Watoga but that's reassuring. 
---
Cool, thanks! I can maybe finish RDR2 before I dive back in to FO76.
---
I play on an original Xbox one, and my camp is actually on the bridge right beside the trainyard at Harper's fairy. Never had an issue there
---
If you've never chased someone across the map with a chainsaw then you haven't had the true fallout experience.

Nah, I'm just bringing it down to your level pooh bear. You can go back to your hobby of giving hand jobs to the homeless.
---
I do the same thing! With weapon primed and ready as if that will help save me from an explosion! LOLOL
---
Gonna be honest, wishing for good pvp in fallout in general is where you went wrong. The games gun combat is decent enough for being a bethesda game and for pve, but when i pvp in fo76 it's mostly just for kicks. 
---
This game would need a massive overhaul to it's core gunplay for pvp to be taken even remotely seriously at least by me, although i do appreciate it being there either way.
---
😂😂😂
---
I Do this and also turn off all radios I encounter.
---
What started it for me was finding the sheet music to get Blackhawk in Fallout 3. When you're on the mission to get the Soil Stradivarius violin, the sheet music is in a stall in the vault. It's the only way to get Blackhawk
---
I do this too in every game if im feeling spicy i open the door and fire off a few shots
---
I just dont like dogs and love to see people freak out when the stupid canine slave they love soe much gets mistreated or when other people dont worship those mutts as much as they do. (or even eat them, tbh they are quite tasty)
---
Scaling isn't bad if it's done properly. ESO's is fine if you have a bad bult and you're not great at the game it would probably feel like you're not getting more powerful. I can guarentee you people in eso one shot most of the outdoor mobs they face with a decent build and overall knowledge of how to play the game optimally (animation canceling etc). If i remember correctly i use a mod on fallout 4 that scales the enmies but it never felt like i wasn't getting powerful as time went by.
---
Random spawns attacking your camp is built into the game just like the previous fallout titles. Regardless where you put your camp it will have a spawn that attacks it. I even built a concrete foundation floating fort that is 3 levels above ground and yet i still get mole rats chewing on my decon shower. Kind of annoying but what ever.
---
Glad to see people with more time on their hands doing the things I eventually planned to do when I got around to it.
---
I do have healing factor so I guess that kinda answers it for me then lol. Thank you.
---
Oh I see now, sorry. The formatting on mobile obfuscated Glow Sight for me. The 45% reduction of explosive damage from fireproof should trivialize scorchbeasts.
---
Then just have lower level mosters than you scale up to like 3-4 levels of your level so they aren't a faceroll.
---
I just met a very nasty invisible enemy at Seneca Gang camp. First I had time to loot through the camp. Then I saw DANGER showing up. And out of the air missiles where hitting me. I had my PA on so I made an escape by running like crazy. I was followed. As I stoped to see if I was out of danger I started to get beaten and pushed away. The enemy did no sound and was not detected by VATS. I jumped down a high cliff and by that got away. The invisibles could be Moles or Mutants as they are strong enough to push a PA. This bug is very bad.
---
I personally want to know how many charms my poor character has consumed lol.
---
Ok will definitely be swapping it in thank you 
---
Thank you for the offer, but I'm on PC. 
---
Even so, I'm looking for a reliable manner to transfer loot, without bothering any other player preferably :)
---
This 1000%
---
I just want a 3 shot burst receiver option.  That’d be real nice.
---
I’d also like the sniper weapon, when you mod with the .50 cal receiver, that thing should be lethal (fo:nv).  
---
Everytime I saw a cricket in fallout 4 I'd nope out. Haven't seen them in Appalachia yet, thank god
---
unless its something i'm going to use i dump Legendary Gear. The caps you get isn't' worth the weight
---
Thank you for the offer, but I really don't want to bother other players since it can be pretty time consuming.
---
Unless you want me to return the favor or pay you, then I wouldn't feel so bad about it :)
---
This happened to me the other day. saw a random paper bag just sitting on the side of the road and I nearly stopped to get it...until I realized it was a Burger King bag.
---
The camp creates an area that is globe shaped.   You can create multi story buildings by building both above and below your camp machine.    To put it another way you need to build both above and below the camp machine.   If you can manage to place the camp machine in for example a tree above the ground this would allow you to build multiple stories.   Cliff sides work as well if you want to drape a building off the side by anchoring from the top.   Trickiest part is getting the camp machine to stick.
---
The change will be positive despite the rate of fire loss simply because the higher damage per shot will hit through more armor then they do currently.  I agree that heavy weapons should be better but its difficult to figure out how without making them extremely unbalanced. At least this is my opinion so dont crucify me for it lol
---
In terms of surviveability, you cannot go wrong with Blocker, Fireproof, and Lone Wanderer for a % reduction in damage taken. If you were not bloodied, I may recommend Cola Nut for a fast 600HP heal.
---
You'll need the Dodgy perk in agility and Blocker in strength. 
---
Those two account for a significant amount of tankiness in any build. 
---
30% reduction in dmg taken for the cost of 30 AP per hit on the former, 45% reduction to all melee dmg taken on the latter. And yes they do stack, though I'm unsure on the math. 
---
Poor deathclaws just tickle at this point. 
---
Other than that, run maxed adamantium skeleton in endurance.  I cannot overstress how important it is that you not take limb dmg as a tank. 
---
I don't mind at all. [This is my build.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=66293ff&amp;d=a72a30a00lv2p02l71l12lk2s61c81i12al2lt2ak2ad2c72sb2pe2cm0cu0ao0lr0em1sv0&amp;w=ce0cf2pm2p10ic2i42i61i71i30ia0i50ii0ij2in1ie2iq2im1ik0if2at1au2ag2lm2l92l62l02sg2p72pa0p80p90ev2&amp;n=Lyle%20Shnub%27s%20VATS%20pistol) 
---
I mostly use a western revolver with a calibrated mod. That takes care of most enemies. That said, I just got an instigating .44 two days ago which I now pretty much use against all trash mobs. It one shots most things with a headshot. Also, I carry a 10mm and black powder pistol that I use rapid build crits and pump them out into boss enemies (scorch beasts and mirelurk queens). A black powder pistol headshot crit tends to take off a fifth or fourth of the health bar of high level regular scorchbeasts. Worth noting that Escape Artist can usually net you an easy sneak attack if you time it just right. Not worth using on most trash, but can be worth attempting on boss enemies, especially when you've got a blackpowder crit ready.
---
I actually think non-auto rifle builds perform best with a crit build since The Dragon benefits from your perks. You might be able to one shot a plain scorchbeast if you had an instigating/crit dragon. That is, assuming the damage-per-hit on them isn't capped.
---
15 LCK lets you crit every 4th shot if you're using crit savvy. It used to be every 3rd shot, but that either got nerfed or was bugged. I prefer stacking AGI/AP or Luck because it has better synergy with Grim Reaper's Sprint. All big boss enemies come with adds, so it's useful all the time to rebuild your AP. However if you've got the consumables, cola and coffee can easily substitute, but since you can't yet reliably brew your own cola or coffee I just save them for SBQ. If you're packing lots of AP restoratives, I'd swap out Grim Reaper's Sprint for Four Leaf Clover. Heck, I'd even drop Action Boy/Girl for more +dmg perks if you have the cola/coffee.
---
As for other perks, I tried running a more stealth/sneak attack oriented build, but I found maxing gunslinger to be more reliable damage. Could work better with rifles tbh. All of my STR perks are purely for inventory management. If you're able to manage your stuff better, then by all means drop them. Bloody Mess is often underrated by a lot of folks who don't know that it's multiplicative damage. It's kind of ridiculous and seems almost like a mandatory perk for all builds imo. I only have 3 in INT because you only need at most 3 points in INT for modding pistols. Only pistol mod that takes higher than 3 is a prime receiver which, unless the description is inaccurate, doesn't even buff crits, so it's useless to me. 
---
Let me know if you need to ask anything else - or if you have any input on my own build. 
---
It seems that you are allowed to build four tiles (including roof) up and down. So if you place your camp device on a mountain, you get 4 tiles below camp device and four tiles above. 
---
How do I completed the overseer's quest? It's an active quest but there's nothing on the map/radar. I haven't stumbled on anything for it in ages. 
---
It seems to only happen if you're wearing power armor and then fast travel directly to Harper's Ferry
---
200% a leftover from Fallout 4
---
Given that you can't really retcon the Great War, I doubt Fallout is permitted in China.
---
Especially since the lore now declares China fired first.
---
Yes - that's just rude.
---
I tried that fix (having a friend drop me his certificate) and it didn’t work for me (When I used the method I described in my OP, I actually had two Soldier’s certificates in my inventory). 
---
But I *have* seen this posted and others confirming it can work. This suggested fix is actually what inspired me to keep giving it another shot. 
---
Seems like this quest might be bugged in a few different ways relating to the Soldier’s Certificate. 
---
Same thing kept on happening to us right now, i know it is not my PC a fully specced alienware 17, not my internet connection either fastest connection offered by comcast and i can get online and watch youtube vids with no problems. But i keep on getting disconnected from server and so does my friends that are scattered all over the country all on PC.

Found it! Left out "gamer" SMH
---
I started server hopping right after I found out it can still be found at Watoga and found it on my 2nd try. I'm just going to leave this post up just incase anyone else was wondering if things changed after the last update.
---
Glad to help, and thanks for the update. 
---
Haha, good one. Sometimes bugs with enemies can be very annoying, like when a legendary enemy falls through the ground or just disappears, but these ones are pretty hilarious and provide good material for the photomode. 
---
Sure. Let me know what you made. Kinda curious now. 
---
I got a bloodied grognaks for 500
---
&gt;If you wear power armor in PvP you’re going to die. Power armor is for defense from enemies, not players.
---
Thats stupid. The power armor has better armor rating than regular armor (at least that i have found so far, but i dont have full legendary sets like some players). 
---
&gt;Likewise, stimpacks spam isn’t feasible outside of PA. Melee wins if you don’t know how to fight it. A shotgun or heavy weapons build easily counters it.
---
LOL i am a shotgun build, using an anti armor piercing shotgun with crit damage against a power armored, stim spamming super sledge user. I unloaded 5+ shots into their head and they tanked them all and 1shot me. Thats not me being bad at the game, its the mechanics of the game being absolutely broken in favor of melee through stim spam exploitation. 
---
I already know what you are going to say, that theres something wrong with my build or weapons to where im not able to 1shot others: thats also fucking stupid, as state before (you ignored it, and in the thread you posted admitted that PVP is a 1shot kill fest) no weapon should ever be a 1 shot outside of mini nukes (which if they were to become the only 1 shot should become very rare and unable to be created). 
---
PVP as a one shot killfest is utterly boring with no depth besides speccing a build a certain way. Theres not much actual "tactics" to flipping on VATS or using some legendary weapon. All that means is you were able to troll legendaries for hours to find a nice roll. Nerf everything that is a 1shot kill immediately IMO
---
Wait - are those open doors I see? Is it just as amazing inside?
---
160 I think
---
Haven't killed the queen since my character topped level 100 a few weeks ago. Right now I'm sitting on 15 nuke key cards waiting for the next patch to see if she's doable again. IF she continues to get harder as you level, but weapons stop at level 50, then that would explain why higher levels have problems taking her down. I just don't know how the scaling works.
---
You on Xbox?
---
Yup
---
What’s your username?
---
No, but look them to be spewing rage on here when they get nerfed.    And I see it happening at some point. 
---
They should really add a dormant deathclaw in a handicap stall. That would get a reaction out of me. 
---
I still dont think im doing anything wrong, no one gets banned for the stuff im doing...ive never greifed nor did i break the terms of the game.  Im going to continue to keep playing the game the way i like. I dont have a bit of remorse for people i kill or rob.
---
I think it might come down to: im playing im a competative way, competing for resources, caps, junk etc. Which involves some tricky raider tactics. You guys are not. Its really bethesdas fault for dropping us in the same servers.  Since release they advertised players as raiders and pvp. They said that if you didn't wanna pvp you would have a toolkit to avoid it. You have such a kit. 4 layers... Pacifist, Block player, serverhop and fast travel. Thats a pretty decent toolkit to avoid the things i do to players. You can alt f4 at anytime... Its your fault if i get you..
---
I wish you were able to have an honest conversation without name calling and getting emotional about a silly game.
---
I wonder if i can report you for the insults youre slinging. Lets see...
---
Blade of Bastet is a level 25 weapon. If you were using the base sword at 20, it's not the same.
---
If that's true I want a refund
---
BZZZKLLNGTN I'll be on soon
---
 I’m about to try and launch another nuke but I told my friend to wait cause I’m about to buy an axe.
---
You can also get Weapon Artisan. Put three points into it and you can repair weapons to 200%.
---
I still don't see Bethesda's problem with offline, it's not like it would be hard to implement
---
Lmao.
---
Or you could do the thirty seconds of due dilligence?
---
Nah, buying something you know you don't want and getting a refund is easier on your ego.
---
It says user not found 
---
I can join u and we can meet up in the nuke zone. What's your gamertag? Also please launch the queen I'm in watoga and can't fast travel
---
All I got is a game that I leveled up through once, finished all but the main nuke quest and haven't touched in months.
---
Gigabit FIOS and the 1x really make it a lot more pleasant though. I haven't crashed once yet, when I play on my other Xbox I crash at least 2 or 3 times each time I play.
---
Alright
---
If they are standing perfectly still out of power armor, it is likely sentinel armor. 
---
If you are Han Solo shooting first, you will do little damage until they attack back. This excludes Wanted status though.
---
Last night I took on a party of 4 by slapping their lowest level and waiting for the higher levels to defend. I made a ton of caps off all of them. They would not stop seeking revenge. Anyways, I noticed they were not doing a whole lot of damage to me. I do not run anything crazy in terms of defense. I only have around 200 armor. I suspect they and you had huge fall off from range penalties. My gun, which does about 300 damage with sneak, headshot and criticals per shot, was taking a lot longer to kill at maximum VATS range. Fortunately, my gun is automatic, so I just shot more.
---
If you have any specific details on your PVP situation, we may be able to give a better explanation.
---
It usually does, what's yours I'll be on in 10
---
Manygalaxy52229. My friend says we are gonna do whitesprinfgs so I guess I’ll just fast travel to you. Look me up and join my party
---
Seriously. This shit was announced before release. The game itself released five months ago.
---
You're just adding fuel to an already idiotic fire.
---
Unyielding? Bolstering? Vanguard? Sentinel? Assassin's? Could be a number of things. Could even be a cheater. If you want to make sure they go down, I'd recommend finding a Sniper. I was testing my friends Armour today, he was basically impervious until I used a crit. Were they taking any damage at all?
---
Cool
---
I want those skeletons from Braxson's Quality Medical Supplies.
---
There's even a note that explains how they create them. I wish reading that would have unlocked skeleton models for your camp.
---
The last time we killed her, there were a bunch of guys with .50 cal guns (me included).  Mine was anti- armor, and I have the one-gun army perk maxed out.  This cripples her and she stays on the ground a lot more.  Having her on the ground as much and as long as possible is key. 
---
  
---
I also froze her multiple times with my two shot cryolator. 
---
It's not because of me that we won, so don't misunderstand,  I'm not claiming credit. 
---
I'm guessing all the other guys out there had similar perks/ legendary effects. 
---
Seems the more guys with heavy weapons the better.
---
And we had about ten people. Manpower matters too.  Bottom line: the more guys with heavy weapons, the better. 
---
I'm not saying others don't contribute, but it does seem to me that you want a lot of big ass guns when fighting her.
---
Xbox One 
---
the real question is.. Why are you playing the worst game of all time?
---
Vampire melee with swing speed.  Faster the weapon the better the hp regen. Vampire buzz blade is super fun at WS ghouls. Def perks are bonuses for extra tankiness.
---
Ignore this guy. I only do nukes solo, and the only time I ever crash is when they’re on Whitesprings. So I stopped doing them there, that simple. Sorry you crashed after your first, it sucks, but it’s not a common issue like this guy says. 
---
Pc? Pretty sure I've got em, if so ill sell it cheap. Should be hopping on soon
---
Some of the glitches can definitely be frustrating, but from my experience, the "good" ones have far outweighed the bad. 
---
Assaultrons are common in the silos 
---
Flash forward a month I just started a melee build a week ago, literally at lvl 35 doing 600 damage with a lvl 20 bloodied sledge hammer. Using no chems or bobbleheads. I have no 2h melee perks. You were doing something wrong.
---
I think pvp should be player v player, not player v team. It’d be really unfair to have some lvl 120 inv me to their team and suddenly I have a high bounty bc some weiner couldn’t keep themselves from trolling around. 
---
simple, ghouls had a chance of hiding in stalls in fallout 4, which is why you're compelled to open stall doors, so that way you can find some loot and gain EXP.
---
I'm convinced they've tweaked something. I do a loop of the main places everyday, and the rate has definitely dropped. 
---
Looking on PS4, myself.
---
I’m currently camping in Toxic Valley. I’ve built 3 stories with a roof balcony where I can relax in peace with a cold beer.
---
I have a ground level outdoor crafting alcove, water purifier, campfire and guitar for visitors. I also have a mini farm with Brahmin pen (thankfully the Brahmin immortal because mobs take him out almost every time I’m in Camp!) 
---
If my luck somehow changes I'll let you know!
---
Abraxo = 1 acid
---
Abraxo industrial = 2 acid
---
I *think* it was on the floor by the rocket launcher spawn in Harpers Ferry, where you look over the gate.
---
 Have you used one? The Western Revolver is really the one to get. ;)
---
&gt;Thats stupid. The power armor has better armor rating than regular armor (at least that i have found so far, but i dont have full legendary sets like some players).
---
With just 1 star assassin stuff you negate 40% damage. That's better than the highest resistance PA in the most optimal situation. That's why if you're serious about PvP, you don't wear it. Additionally, PA has a fusion core you can target with concentrated fire.
---
&gt;LOL i am a shotgun build, using an anti armor piercing shotgun with crit damage against a power armored, stim spamming super sledge user
---
That sounds like an easy build to kill. I think you're build is just bad for PvP.
---
&gt;I already know what you are going to say, that theres something wrong with my build or weapons to where im not able to 1shot others
---
Yup. Whatever you build you character to be good at, they're going to be good at that one thing. That's the game and that's kinda how it's tended to work via SPECIAL.
---
&gt;no weapon should ever be a 1 shot outside of mini nukes
---
Not every weapon can 1 shot. It's all about finding what weapons are good against which builds. Not all weapons are viable against all builds.
---
&gt;Theres not much actual "tactics" to flipping on VATS or using some legendary weapon.
---
The counter to VATS is crouching. It kinda is about tactics. You identify the person's build, you see what you can leverage, and you counter their tactics with your own. In some situations, you can't because your build is wholly vulnerable to theirs, and that's the consequence to choosing a build. 
---
Single foundation floaty base. 
---
ALWAYS check ur terlits 
---
It's not you. I believe it's loading an event/quest/spawn.
---
Every time I do my salvage/junk run from summersville,  camp mcclintok, Wade airport. I go south to the charelston capital building to see if muties spawned. As soon as I hit the east/west road I hang =a Grafton monster spawned.
---
If I don't hang nothing spawns. 
---
This is just my observation. Could be something else also.
---
Good luck and happy hunting
---
Instigating is better for trash mobs, and furious is great for SBs and other strong enemies. Keep them both if you can.
---
Semi related, I have an AA super sledge for day to day use, and a furious +power attack sledge that I only use for the Queen. By the 4th or 5th swing I start taking large chunks of her health with each hit. 
---
Not sure on PS4, but most of the PC people just made new account, repurchased the game and started over. they said they will release the account in a future patch, but..... Who knows if/when that will be. 
---
Ok my friend said he will solo it while I do the trade. Your welcome to help us get through the silo if you can.
---
I'm joining your game I'll meet u at whitespring
---
Maybe you shouldnt have duped
---
I can't fast travel but I'll be around defiance when I spawn
---
Make a new Bethesda account and repurchase the game.
---
Grafton Monster does do weird things to my Game now that you mention it. Whitespring gets weird when a GM spawns and Charleston spawns them quite often. I really hope there is a fix though, it doesn't affect everyone
---
yeah I started during the beta and it the mob scaling was never an issue then. Probably because everybody was roughly the same-ish levels. 
---
Then I had to take a long break at the end of November due to irl stuff and health issues. Now finally coming back into it and only being a level 20 something it's a huge issue. 
---
I'm having to server hop like crazy or royally fuck up my sleep schedule by playing super late at night when not many other ppl are on; just in order to be able to do simple quests without constantly getting ganked by level 40+ enemies.
---
Maybe make a new psn and try a new character that way. It should work
---
When I was neck deep in FO4, I had the urge to pick flowers and bushes (to brew chems of course).  Quite annoying.
---
Didn't even know there was a rocket launcher spawn in HF
---
I really hope so.
---
Oh ok, so it‘s just not me. Maybe we both just got bad luck lately.
---
I wish I could even try it out, I am sure that it has improved, but my time while playing it was very painful, mainly because of performance. My PC is better than average, but I think that my CPU is what fucks everything up, making the game stutter all the time.
---
That could be the case. Although I have used the Blade of Bastet later as well but still didn't find it to be that powerful, compared to the damage I do with my Pipe Pistols.
---
Oh then it makes sense then.
---
I nuked Whitesprings 
---
Xbox, sorry
---
This is the way it works, yeah. Take away the gear, mutations, perks and stat increases you acquire and a level 100 won't do any more damage than a level 1. 
---
I'm not bothered if people use my camp. Come and have a drink and a chill and mod your weapons. I might have a different mind set if my stash was at risk though.
---
Hey, I am just sharing my experience with another player and trying to be helpful. It doesn’t hurt to have a team just in case the “notoriously stable” servers crash. I am on PS4 and the servers crash all the time, especially when there is a nuke... so no need to be rude towards me being helpful.
---
I find purified water and beer. Should I *really* be drinking them? lol
---
I’d also like to know this. 
---
I just log out to the main menu and relog on my second account. 95% of the time, I have to take my mule through whitesprings or they don't reload.
---
Must be a proximity based trigger.
---
Averagebaters is really good but hes taken a break from 76 to make red dead content until the DLC drop for 76.
---
Hi, im that random guy...
---
First. I never intended to upset you. I just want your caps and all your stuff.
---
Try crits. They bypass sentinals/cavaliers. 
---
Until i pop a stealthboy.. The you gotta run! Or try berry mentats &amp; stagger me with a shotgun, minigun or melee.
---
With the correct gear, every build has a counter.
---
Youre welcome,
---
Raider.
---
You can find them in the toxic valley, but they are stupid rare. r/market76 is your best bet, but they have been getting more expensive.
---
Yes. Because damage is based on perks and weapon level. Player level does not really mean anything besides the key you need to unlock perks and weapons/armor. And as far as I know enemy level is just and indication of their DR. And most of that could by figured out by their name like FO4. 
---
'I know I cheated the system, made the servers unstable with my million explosive bobbleheads, and it was because Bethesda gave me a bugged game. So yeah, I cheated, but hey, I at least didn't pirate it. So although I got caught and banned for it, I'm still wanting to play it. If only there was a way I could have played the game without using exploits. Oh, you mean I didn't  have to? Pretty please with sprinkles in top? Please, I paid for it, oh come on Bethesda, please?'
---
Is what I heard through that whole request. Bye bye banned Dude.
---
I'm glad that they don't allow other players to access your personal stash. Can you imagine!? 
---
\*snuggles up to Bessie\*
---
Boarderlands trained me of this habit.
---
It would be absolute chaos. But in a bad way.
---
I leave my CAMP open for use with a couple open signs and cardboard signs pointing at the open water purifiers, crafting benches and so on. I've had people leave me brown bags with stuff. I've also had people attack CAMP items to low health for whatever reason.  I think people can have whatever type of CAMP they want.
---
Down the steps, hug the wall to the right, in through the hole in the wall, through the ground floor, out the back, take a right, jump up on the car, in to the train car, use that to ramp up to the first floor, then stairs inside up to the second floor, rocket launcher on the floor by the toilet.
---
That's a heavy metal chest piece. Polished and Alloyed mods are better if you eventually unlock them. In theory you should be able to find legendary heavy metal pieces, but they don't seem to be common.
---
That’s us
---
Yeah, there RN.  Gonna server hop a bit and see what's what 
---
Have you actually gone into the atom shop when it prompts you to change? 
---
Uhhh. Two shot an ghoul slayers are both prefix modifiers, eg can't be on a gun together.
---
there are no ghoul slayers two shot explosives.
---
Thank you. I didn't understand the disliking of my reply. Idgaf about karma, but my conscious is clear and my message was from the heart and from my personal experiences on xbox. Tgought it was just some friendly, however a bit crude, advice. 
---
Which are not going to be in use during situations like these, since 'grandpa' really has no reason to hide his origin.
---
Plus you cause enough havoc via VPN, the VPN provider's logs can be obtained too.
---
On the same boat as you here, but maybe bethesda hasnt done another check/ban wave since this guy crafted 100000 shells in 24 hours
---
&gt;With just 1 star assassin stuff you negate 40% damage. That's better than the highest resistance PA in the most optimal situation. That's why if you're serious about PvP, you don't wear it. Additionally, PA has a fusion core you can target with concentrated fire
---
Already said i dont have full sets of legendary armor like that (mostly due to time). And thats still stupid, Armor is just given to the player whereas PA takes quite a few mats to build, they should at least have PA builds viable to PVP. PVP shouldnt be limited to obscure niche super builds and should never be a 1shot killfest. 
---
&gt;That sounds like an easy build to kill. I think you're build is just bad for PvP.
---
Your*. I dont spend most of my time with PVP since im still leveling up and trying to accumulate good weapons and gear (lvl 71). 
---
&gt;Yup. Whatever you build you character to be good at, they're going to be good at that one thing. That's the game and that's kinda how it's tended to work via SPECIAL.
---
Exactly, you admitted in the other thread that one handed melee is the best for PVP and most people would use whats the best 1shot in a 1shot kill fest. Thats not balanced at all and PVP shouldnt be biased in favor of certain builds over others.
---
&gt;Not every weapon can 1 shot. It's all about finding what weapons are good against which builds. Not all weapons are viable against all builds.
---
No weapons should 1 shot, thats absolutely stupid and broken. 
---
&gt;The counter to VATS is crouching. It kinda is about tactics. You identify the person's build, you see what you can leverage, and you counter their tactics with your own. In some situations, you can't because your build is wholly vulnerable to theirs, and that's the consequence to choosing a build.
---
You ignored the rest of the comment about 1shotting. What you are describing arent tactics, its just experimenting with different builds and throwing shit at the wall until something sticks. 
---
Tactics would be using cover, flanking, setting traps, etc. All of which are pretty much useless in a 1shot killfest. You dont have time to implement anything you would in an actual FPS game or firefight because you are dead before any meaningful engagement occurs, which is stupid. 1 shot killfest makes PVP broken, unenjoyable, and boring. 
---
I played for 6 hours yesterday and saw at least 5 of then at watoga over the session. I bought and used 2 on my 2 gauntlets 
---
Was just thinking this...why the clocks all show the same time in game already is one thing (thank you for pointing that out), but an alarm clock just built, that's different. Why it only reads 1200am, just doesn't make sense. Especially since it's in the Atom shop even though it's free this week, and I know my character can set an alarm clock if he can modify an SMG
---
I usually message players relatively close to my camp to let them know it’s there and invite them to use it if they want too. I have a fort that sits about 1mm above the water that can only be accessed by a walkway from one side, The compound has everything they could possibly need. 
---
Was with my mom a few weeks back at an antique store, there was a display in one corner: old fashioned desk with a typewriter, fan, couple pens and pencils, and a globe and little lockbox on a shelf near by. 
---
My fingers started twitching.
---
Because fallout 3 and new vegas taught us that drug users were in the bathroom with their chems when the bombs dropped.
---
Wow. I am fortunate to not have visited the link but even knowing it makes me feel terrible. Sorry you guys had to see that.
---
I've never seen a legendary pipe weapon - 220 hours game play.
---
I really want one damnit.
---
Bulk as much as you can, saves space and gives you saleable commodities.
---
Had my base at back of white springs I was crafting guy comes in with trade which I only realised was, checking what weopons I had.
---
I was lvl 61 he was 176 unloaded a mini gun on him. And he had to call in two 200 lvl players save his ass lol. But that it in 150hrs on Ps4 
---
I bought it from the vendor in Lewisburg.  It's crap though, that gun has only only the ivory grip mod. 
---
Sweet! What is needed to craft Stims? 
---
95% is 25% ?
---
Effing ham radios, have they *ever* been important? I don’t know but I keep checking anyways 
---
Platform? I've been farming it not nuked because soloing nukes is kinda boring.
---
I'm down if you're on pc.
---
C-137_MrMeeSeeks.
---
How do it change that?
---
I'm a filthy casual and I'm happy to help out. All you have to do is befriend someone on a server. Once you have been accepted, you can quit to menu, change character, and click "social", select your new "friend" and "JOIN". Go collect your newly twinked loot. I tend to get both characters in the same location before I make my swap. 
---
The only risk is if your new friend logs out in the interrim between switching characters.  That's why I usually get two or three to accept that way if one player drops out, I can use the second to get back to the same server. 
---
So far, I've never lost a twinked item. 
---
If you see me on the server:  FineUntilUCameAlong - i'm happy to accept your friend request. 
---
There are more mods
---
As stated in another comment, yes.
---
I guess I'll have to start building and scrapping then. thx
---
Sounds like you want Fallout 5, and not Fallout 76.
---
Colonel Gutsy. I just hate them. Too quick fire rate. Too. Damn. Quick!
---
Ever since I fell for that trick in F03, I've kind of missed seeing it reused. 
---
Use tinker tom station to bulk junk you will need plastic. Get rid of most of your rubber glass ceramic steal ect the crap you find every where sell them at the various vendors scrap all non legendary weapons you won't be using and only pick up ammo up of what you use it takes up loads of space and you cant sell them to vendors. Decide your build now scrap everything you wont need for it even if you change your mind later down the road you will pick them up again. 
---
Server stability has been far better. Crash to desktops have become more common.
---
Could be my old ass rig is dying, though.
---
Yep! Especially when it's in those mandatory quest areas, or in areas that were normal level 20minutes earlier. Being level 20 and coming up against a handful of level 70 Super Mutants isn't fun. I stand NO chance... So many assholish comments about how scaling makes a game good, but teleporting to an area that was fine when you played last, only to get promptly WTF-owned is not good at all.
---
I was mostly solo for 135+ hours but ran into another player and we helped each other with Enclave quests. Joined a team and ran amok a bit, go back to my CAMP to repair and restock where the player finds out Im a girl (I had been in PA for the Enclave events). The other player makes some crack about my gender and then mansplains to me how to play for the rest of that run before I get bored and log off. 
---
A week later we team up again and now he follows me everywhere while wearing a prisoner collar, despite him being team leader. My husband says I now have an online boyfriend and honestly, I dont want to team up with anyone ever again. 
---
Just checking , but until I was like level 25 I didn’t know that you could scrap all junk down to its components which saves literal tons of space , if you haven’t done that then you should.
---
Also cutting back on pretty much useless heavy ammo such as missiles or mini nukes is a good thing to do too unless you plan on using them.
---
&gt;Back to components.
---
It won’t save a ton of space but try getting rid of a bunch of materials like asbestos , leather , fertiliser , wood or steel etc , the first 3 rarely get used so you don’t need much of it and the last 2 are extremely common anyway so you won’t miss it.🐸
---
And find white springs not only do you find great plans there higher level players leave plans mods weapons by the shops for lower levels players and ever crafting station you could need is there. Happy hunting
---
If you DO use ammo, craft it up at tinker bench. Uses up steel and lead. Both of which are heavy items.
---
I keep my resources, crafting stations and one public bed open. The only thing I lock is my personal quarters.
---
If your pc struggles to run fo76 then its not a pc, it’s laptop, coupled with the fact that it’s unoptimized garbage 
---
She’s a good Brahmin. 
---
I allow all my stuff open. Unless there's a server with BS going on then I lock it. 
---
Got griefed once with assasin/sentinel guy. Killed him 2 times while he was moving but he killed me like 8 times. When he was standing still my 1300 dmg per shot bloodied explosive shotgun point blank hit moved his health bar about 10%: that is one hell of an damage distribution. Staggering, crits and gamma guns are the only solution unless you get an assasin/sentinel set of your own and it comes a shooting range
---
It would be nice to see in game time on the clocks.
---
Except it ended up being true. Because he nuked Whitesprings. I’m not trying to be rude but you’re spreading false information, nukes don’t inherently destabilize the server. It just depends where they drop 
---
I'm pretty sure those can only be placed on foundations. I've tried lots of ways to get them on my second floor but I always end up having to use the other metal ones. It wouldn't be so bad if I could snap them to the left or right side instead of the middle. It would also be nice to have some other variations other than metal 
---
1. Missiles, 40mm grenades, mini nukes and thrown explosives are heavy. If you don’t use them, drop them. Same with large amounts of unused ammo. 
---
2. Make sure all junk has been scrapped. 
---
3. Bulking junk does NOT save any significant amount of space, it just uses plastic. However, if you bulk it, you can sell it to vendors. Then you get caps instead of useless scrap. 
---
4. Once your base is built, you really don’t need to keep more than 100-150 of any particular scrap item. I actually cap it at 50 for most things. You’ll find some exceptions depending on your play style, but it’s a good rule to follow. 
---
5. Some scrap items can be sold individually. Basically anything that can’t be bulked. Same 100-150 rule applies. 
---
I mule off to a second account pretty regularly.
---
Camp hemlock holes on my main, mule crap off, once done, i continuously relog whitesprings from my mule to farm it.
---
No issues if you wanna mule while I'm farming. I'm camping the server for acid anyway. Usually on midnight -6am ish PST on my days off.
---
C-137_MrMeeSeeks
---
You mean like a mixed armor set? Half bolstering, half vanguard? 
---
I like the way Borderlands 2 handled this with a special shared locker between characters with a limited stash. Would definitely be handy.
---
Absolutely 
---
Did it come from humanely farmed ash flower fed ghouls?
---
Haha this has happened to me a few times, scorchbeast legendaries are awful! I’ve had better luck with legendary super mutants! Hope they address this in an update 
---
Is he the guy that was buying tons of steel and lead on PC?
---
Does this... mean I've been wasting my time stockpiling steel and that there isn't really a market for it? Ah MAN!
---
I don't find playing very rewarding or fun at the moment. Hope it gets better.
---
R/fo76bazaar
---
As a ranged player, I rarely drop below 75-80% health, so I'm running a full vanguard set and my DR is a little shy of 400. Autostim is great for this type of build
---
I feel like bolstering is a better fit for close quarters combat players: shotgunners/melee. But that's just, like, my opinion, man. 
---
Junk traders always have a buyer
---
I still think the player should be scaled down to the area. 
---
So while randomly wandering around I actually found a lvl 1 non hostile DOG. I chilled with it for like 30 minutes. I do not know if you could tame it, I don’t have the relevant perks. BUT IT WAS A FUCKING NON HOSTILE DOG!!!!!!!!  
---
I keep mine open. I have used plenty of people's CAMPs; they can be resl lifesavers in the middle of nowhere.My CAMP is in the Ash Heap, which is not exactly a great place to be in for low levels anyway, so at least you always get all the workbenches, a stash and some food and water and a bed to crash. All the basic needs of a Vault Dweller.
---
Yeah I assume they are about somewhere but this normal one is the best protective one ive found thus far
---
John... John where are you? Lasaaaaania John. Moooondaaaaays.
---
It's that way in Rust and it's just horrible. Clans make huge fortresses to stash their loot, and clash raid each other all the time. 
---
What are the silos?
---
Where does it say that? Genuine question.
---
Im 99% sure Bethesda have said theres gonna be a leaderboard added when the survival mode drops
---
This sounds super unfun
---
yeah I had a moment like that earlier today at the palace of the winding path. Level 68 scorched conqueror came at me out of nowhere. Needless to say I’m only like level 23 and was straight up gone in like 2 hits. 
---
I found one the other day in black water mine, the BOS combat arms. I guess they’re just a really rare drop now but they do exist. I’m on XB1 btw 
---
Just start selling your junk after you fill it up. Also I transfer junk to my alt characters, did a few times, just started new. 
---
I bulk a lot. 
---
Also sell junk before you scrap it, you can sell more unscrapped vs scrapped junk which is not sellable. Drop items or sell items you have large numbers of .. never sell springs, screws or gears, they high valuable items and you always going to need them. Never give away springs even if you best friend or brother asks.
---
"Whats he doing now?"
---
"Looting a building."
---
"He just picked up a holotape! Move move move!"
---
Worked like a charm 👌
---
You really don't need that much junk (I have to keep reminding myself this too). Keep only what you need to repair current items. Use the tag feature to mark the materials you desperately need. 
---
Camp near a place you can easily raid if you need something.
---
The magic sentinel armor is one of the dumbest inventions in fo76. You take little damage when standing still. I plan to make a jacket under similar name and sell it to street gangs and make police’s job much easier. 
---
I have to agree. Pvp in this a god aweful joke. I just switch servers when I run across shitheads that just insist. 
---
You get more XP for crafting the item? Because they removed the passive XP bonus for intelligence in Fallout 76.
---
Does it give crafted fusion cores the little white bar too? I was unaware and that would be awesome.
---
It'd probably be too much work. That'll require a huge reworking of in game models. They'll probably never want to do it. What they could do, however, was make the Nixie Tube Alarm clock show the time.
---
Good to know!
---
That's rubbish.
---
I
---
I open them to find drugs.
---
No luck so far, but if it does spawn I see where it would be
---
Yes the more the merrier!
---
That is a shame. I like those painting the most!
---
You’re being downvoted because people suck at building, apparently. 
---
Ah cool one of the "This opinion attacks my escapism, can't have that, lets label that clickbait" threads.
---
You run into her chests at marked locations throughout Appalachia. When you discover a location that had a chest it will then mark it on the map. They are scattered everywhere, but I believe if you follow the journal quest it will eventually lead you to them. If not I know most of them are at locations that you will have to visit before launching a nuke on your own, Camp McClintock is to get the paperwork to get a Driver's License from the DMV so that you have a valid government ID, which you need for part of the MODUS quest I believe.
---
If you’re low-health build yes they can blast you to death before you know what had hit you. Terrain and structures are your best friends. What’s really ridiculous is that the game doesn’t let them drop proper weapons when they’re killed. I’ve killed scorched wielding gamma guns and gold-plated miniguns, all I could loot from them were shotguns and sickles. 
---
What lvl are you they have a lvl you unlock them at 
---
Your camp is yours and no-one else has a right to your camp. A lot of twats say they will blow up your camp if locked, but do what you like, its yours. I wish they couldn't enter your camp without your permission like GTA. That been said, I leave all my doors unlocked, my extractors except for my lead one unlocked, I leave all my purifiers unlocked so people can help themselves to free water and free food.
---
I personally think you a noob if you lock your water up as it regenerates, so there is no reason to help the community with some free stuff.
---
Huh? I see plenty of 10mms. Scorched have them a lot
---

I sent you a Friend Invite we can do the mission later tonight.
---
I sent you a friend Invite we can do it later tonight.
---
That's the same way I had set mine up, but still got griefed. Now I lock every door and even the shutters. If you have a bed, chair, or workbench within reach of a shutter, they can activate it to be ported inside of your house.
---
I just had this happen to me with chemist yesterday. Spent forever looking for it knowing exactly where it was and then looked and I had the card already. Not sure if this is a new update but had never noticed it before.
---
Don’t know if you’ve noticed but when robots are killed in a nuked zone, they drop glowing MEAT. So you don’t need new perks to enjoy eating them. 
---
Awesome tips!
---
From what I understand it is pretty much because of that. You went from a unified Greece to an era where it was torn apart by war both on land and on sea. It is where we get all the cool flavor and gossip we got from what we knew eventually as Ancient Greece. City States bred a lot of amazing tales, some of which are believed to originate from truth but there is no way of knowing for sure. 
---
The same could be said for any online game. At the very least they could release a local server. 
---
But they don’t, for various reasons. For one thing, online-only games can’t be pirated if they require any authentication. But mostly, games tuned for online are tuned for online. It would be kinda pointless to play it entirely solo after the main quest is over. 
---
The whole point of my initial comment was to provide a friendly tip to run with a team just in case your server crashes when you run a nuke so you don’t miss out on the fruits of your labor. I have seen the server crash on a nuke at more locations than just Whitesprings, so for you to say I am spreading false information is ignorant.
---
I've had this happen as well. I just figured it was noping out of the fight. 
---
Why do you need a team when your build can handle the glowing beauties alone? 
---
Do you play online games much?
---
Mountainside bed and breakfast has one a table which alluded me for awhile. Check there.
---
Before you do though, check the atom challengers for it as well, I found out I was missing mountainside in there.
---
I know there’s also one that generates at site Charlie after you launch a nuke.
---
I do it for the funny Easter Eggs!! 90% of the time worth finding!
---
i heard since the Nerf energy weapons are no longer explosive but haven't confirmed. 
---
Check out r/fo76bazaar their are always folks looking for trades there
---
Thanks!

Welcome to The Wastes
---
Sometimes you get the greaser jacket and jeans on the floor with the rocket launcher and just once I've seen the helmet.
---
There's a few stimpacks in a sink in a building around the whitesprings locked houses, it's right by the second entrance that leads to the waste disposal site
---
Sounds good.  I’m in CST.
---
around april 9th according to the roadmap.
---
No. A mule is someone who holds or transports goods for someone else ... i know the definition you're referring to ... but since you're just applying your own defunition despite my usage of the words in order to somehow obfuscate my point I'll illuminate you. 
---
The game is set up with certain restrictions to make it a game. Coming up with ways around these eestrictions is not playing the game. Its gaming the game. 
---
For the record i dont have any objection to having multiple charecters. But a charecter who's sole purpose is to hold inventory above and beyond the intended restrictions is circumventing the rules of 'the game'.
---
 And again not the point, muling by my usage of the word refers to someone holding duped items while another player duped said items, keeping those items on that server while the duper glitched off the server had his account rolled back; thereby duplicating the items, then logging back into that server or transporting said duped items from one location to another as duper and dupers mule(your definition here) were too ovencumbered to make the journey themselves.
---
I agree that stash limits are rediculously low, especially for traders, But junk can be acquired at any time ... same as ammo ... so, you have to farm one day, or half a day between your pvp or pve ... that's part of the game and can be fun in itself. 
---
And read between the lines OP's only argument was 'no i didn't' ... he obviously did. he got caught and was banned. Argunig that your way of breaking the rules is ok because you think so isn't an argument its a confession.
---
Too bad there isn't weapons that can move people enough to drop the sentinel buff.
---
It said on the actual picture of the roadmap that it would be April 9th I’m pretty sure 
---
When they pop it spells SOS
---
Baseball cap, Trilby hat, Dirty Tan suit, Greaser Jacket so far.  All at least 4x
---
Explosive energy weapons got patched out of the game a few patches ago. Those that still have them work, but no new ones will drop.
---
Same here. I visited my grandparents recently and they have a old typewriter I saw it and my heart skipped a beat because I love screws.
---
So any other type of ranged weapon can dropped for explosive correct?
---
Hopefully Bethesda fixes things like this. I’m sorry to hear this happening to you :/ 
---
‘Legendaries I’ve molested’ Here sir, take my upvote you absolute squire 😂
---
Unfortunately I’ve only ever had slugger don’t ever remember seeing the others.  Am not a gamer except for fallout so maybe I did something wrong.?
---
I tried rifle build it simply didn’t work well for me. Sniper rifles can’t handle horde situations well, especially when there are other players around. Handmade was awesome for a while but was nerfed too much. Also there’s no perks for reducing rifle weights is there? Therefore I switched to a Strength build which allows me to change from heavy guns to shotguns to melee by swapping a few perk cards. It’s just more versatile and allows me to experiment different weapons for fun. Yes melee can be really powerful if you can get close. On my first try I killed a level 80 SB with only a few swings using my bloodied supersledge. However if it doesn’t land I could only dodge around their sonic blasts and waste stimpaks. 
---
Its actually better to leave them as ores until you need them.
---
1acid (0.1) + 2 ore (0.1 each) makes 5 scrap (0.1each) so its only 60% the weight as base mats.
---
What do you mean fix? Workshops are meant to be PVP 
---
Ah, okay. I hadn't seen that. Thank you.
---
Watoga has them patrolling around the outside of city.
---
To add to this you can get your own blood packs with a super easy tic hunt. Just equip the butcher's bounty perk for almost gaurenteed blood from every tick.
---
Faat travel to the vault and go due south to the moonshiners but there are about 4/5 ticks there, then go farther south to the lumber yard where there are about 6/7 more tics as well as 3 chem boxes.
---
As long as you also also lol it a few steel lying around and take the blood sac which yeilds antiseptic you can get everything needed for crafting on this simple run. If you use the perks mentioned in the post above you can do this in about 5min and get 30/40 stim packs as both the blood packs and stims are affected by super duper and chemist.
---
I don't even bother with doors.  It's workstations, stove, bed, etc. I have one turret guarding my generator and lead processor.  If someone messes it up, it isn't like I can't fix it with 15 minutes of salvaging. So far, no one has ever torn it up. 
---
I figured the Colonel Gutsy should rank up there.
---
You are my spirit animal.
---
Same, started it up yesterday and sat at my camp for like five minutes and realized I had nothing at all to do.
---
Keep the well rest buff by sleeping in a bed. It will give a 5% boost to exp for about 2hrs.
---
That sounds like a phantom pain lol
---
I'm guesing you've tried server hopping and a full reset
---
Workshops are meant to be PVP so keep this in mind. It sucks someone would slap damage you rather then just claiming. But there are assholes out there. 
---
When building only use the mats that are green
---
 Those are stored in the workshop and you won't loose anything if you loose the workshop. Using the contractor perk (I am not sure when. This unlocks ) will make things way cheaper. 
---
I think part of your problem is going for power plants  at to low of a level. Either tram up with higher levels who like PVP or stick to smaller work shops. That should help.
---
Do you play on Xbox ?
---
Those things are my Kryptonite. Holy crap are they more deadly than anything in the game! 
---
Yeah it’s been like this for a few awhile now, been on quite a few servers, how do I do a full reset? 
---
If you have friends or people you trust to facilitate holding items for you; gather or craft leveling gear and reroll. It will be quite fast Especially if you plan out your build and stick to only taking perks you know you will use. 
---
Respeccing is not impossible but i do find it now of a challenge. Im respeccing a build right now. I've found what works best for me is picking up the cards My desired build must have to work ( like building a new "Deck" ). Then once I am finished i reallocate points . Some people save them up but i like to place them as i go so i can work out any kinks as I slowly transition.  I am not ranking up many cards until my points are in place so i can be flexible during this stage but still am effective adventurer. I hope this insight helps, good luck.
---
I would say test it out first. It seems really nice especially if you use vats 
---
I have character that uses vat pistol. I may change it over to vats sniper. Thanks. 
---
Yeah but GTAV came with the single player :P
---
Teaming up with more people usually makes it easier to quickly kill glowies and (from my observations) the more people in an actual team (not just vicinity) the higher-star items will drop.
---
Spent some time shooting Whitespring glowies in a group, not teamed up, and most of us got just 1 \* items each time, and another time, with a similar group of around 10 players divided into 3 teams, we had somewhat better drops. Not confirmed by many games tho, so might be wrong.  
---
I'm looking for a group doing these often and regularly in hopes of better drops.
---
I believe so
---
I just got a two shot from a lvl 1 legendary chicken, and at the same spawn point upon returning i got a two shot furious dragon from a lvl 1 legendary rabbit,  took a trip around the map and went back again and spawned a 3 star lvl 40 legendary glowing radstag that gave me a freaking pencil! I took pics with my phone but i cant seem to find an option to insert pics on this app. 
---
Thanks for your offer, I might join at some point but for now I need a whole team doing nuked glowies.
---
This was weird, I go to do the "One Violent night" event, everythings going fine and I managed to get to about halfway through the bar and then outta nowhere get one shotted by a Level 70 ghoul, I was confused and ran back and now every ghoul that spawned was around that level, it was because a group of Level 70-80s players just joined in and now the ghouls stacked to their level.
---
It’s only so cheap on one site, every other retailer is $45 min and I’m from Australia where games are usually $110. Cdkeys has it for $20
---
I didnt know that pets are agro to everyone but you.  I'm a level 115 and maxed my build out at around lvl 70 and scince then I've just been exploring perks. I have 3 ranks of animal friend. I'm gonna move my camp from the savage divide to the forest near the overseers camp and send the highest level death claw I can find to my camp. Then lure low-mid level players near my base and watch as psycho-tats (thats gonna be his name) rips them a new one.
---
I just meant of the game itself, ya know? Turn it off and back on lol. Other than that idk of any fixes. 
---
Oooooh Sunday evening dunks! Haha i love it! He's right though, there's a counter for everything. I try to be more of a gentleman and give you something for your time if you surrender in voice chat. Try it, a satiated Savage may respect your submission.
---
I randomly came across these guys the other night. Worth checking them out. Cool little set up mini mall they have. 
---
Instigating effect is my favorite. 
---
I have a level 50 Instigating Handmade and with my sneak perks and full rifleman cards I hit for 3.5x AFTER the 2x damage modifier, coupled with armor penetrating clip. Nothing but scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens survive the first shot if I am hidden. 
---
I don't even run sentinel but pvp in this game is some heart pounding excitement... If you were planning on it. If not- you shouldn't be doing it.
---
Haha don’t want to reset if now I’m level 65! Thanks lol
---
I'm reading that as: "need two more for nuked whitesprings."
---
Most of my friends are waiting until april content updates. Ill pm you the discord I'm using to find/host nuke runs for now. Pretty populated (like 5k some subs still)
---
Yeah, if memory serves in New Vegas one of the better unique weapons (Knock-Knock) was found in a bathroom stall.
---
I think the game is more fun to play at the lower level, so now that I "know" the game better, I've been replaying a purpose-built character as my first build is really a jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none approach. 
---
I'm starting to Melee more, seeing the armor repairs at a more frequent rate, but it seems worth it as I can get through more hordes safer. Started a big guns build and want to switch to melee, just a bit afraid to since melee seems a bit overpowered now and we all know updates like to nerf things
---
Semi permanent camp. Got way to tired of not having one while playing.
---
I do more solid buildings but we don't have angled supports for floors.
---
Here is what it currently looks like
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/ayuhmi/updated_cliff_side_condo_with_a_view/ei3fyvw/?context=3
---
antiseptic, blood packs, and steel
---
You need to upload them to imgur (or any image sharing site) and link the URL to post pics on Reddit
---
I do the same thing. 
---
Hilarious 😭
---
I mean, how would you have known it wasn't ALL chems though? You tried a couple different ones right? 😁
---
Only things I lock are water purifiers, and the door to my generator room. I leave everything else free for people to use. I just ask people close the doors when they leave. 
---
I do agree, if someone isn't in a pvp spot then I really don't see the point in trying to fight them. Unless its doing juvenile stuff like running up like trying to psyche you out by running up with weapons out shooting at ground like they are billy badass. Those kids are throwed off but they do advertiseme clearly that any further interaction is a gonna on the low tier Axe body spray scented realm.  They are usually wearing skull masks and sun dresses or some exotic fashion disaster, rare outfit with poorly matched accessories. Jumping up and down .  Gun out looking at the ground. Someone's they throw up a trade window instead of responding in kind to your greeting emote... Bunch of savages
---
I play online games, but my frustration stems from a couple of things here. 
---
This isn’t just some random online game, it’s a fallout game that’s part of a franchise. Being different isn’t bad, and that’s why I make it clear I enjoy the game a lot for what it is. 
---
Fallout has traditionally been a solo experience, and even though that’s changed, Bethesda promised that the game could still be played like a traditional fallout if that’s what you desire. 
---
But that’s essentially not true for the reasons I’ve listed which is very frustrating for many fans of fallout. 
---
I don’t mind interacting with people, in fact it’s fun at certain times. I don’t think anyone likes being killed over and over with 0 chance of survival though. It ruins the gameplay. 
---
It's better but still has a lot of work needed. For example, the scorchbeast queen fight still has ridiculously poor server performance.
---
I hope so
---
Recently built in the Mire in a little swampish area on the river which has several small islands and trees all. All made of wood with upraised foundations out of the water with a brahmin pen and the water purifiers etc which all give a great swamp cabin feel. love it
---
Eventually going to make a concrete garage/bunker with high tech / power armor feel but for now my homely swamp house is perfect.
---
Cheers 
---
Clocks stopped when the bombs fell. You have pipboys or terminals but no one is really on a schedule in this alternate reality. Screw time.
---
Shouldn't take too long for you to drop items, me to pick them up and then you relog, then for me to fast travel to you and drop them again should it? :) 
---
Tell you what, I'm going to start a hashtag for you, #milliondeadgolferghoulsforbannedduperdudetgatwantsbackintofallout76. Should only take oh, 17 years or so.
---
Is the op on Xbox?
---
I ran into a swarm of scorched crickets in the Mire once. I've never run so fast for no reason. 
---
Thats a lotta wind bro.  Animals dont attack structures and tear then down piece at a time.  People dont generally attack non occupied structures.  It doesnt make sense.
---
You don't have to power up the plane to make Fusion cores. The generator recipes are for sale so taking the power plant is really pointless now. Unless you want exp. After securing it i would wait a bit before taking the camp.
---
This is exactly why a lot of people were not excited about taking Fallout online. Yes, Bethesda tried to calm people by saying things like that, but it’s not possible to play it entirely like a traditional Fallout. 
---
It sucks. Mostly I avoid other people for this reasons. My experience is generally better for it. 
---
Gauss Rifles only exist in the 35, 40, and 45 range. So the damage step up is actually pretty minimal. The benefits tied to that gun are probably better than the base damage increase you would find with the level 45 weapon. (I THINK it only 15 pts BASE damage difference, but can't prove it atm) 
---
With the right perks it should hit very very hard. 
---
Okay I do have it. I’m online right now. OGREGEV
---
There are usually 3 bags in the Watoga shopping vendors store on the shelves against the far wall as you enter near the counter end of the store.
---
We keep improving on the design - glad you liked it!
---
I found a regular one at Appalachian Antiques, all sorts of random headgear periodically actually.
---
I think you'd have better luck by making a new post. This one is old news by this point. Plus, i don't have knowledge on computers.
---
I'm not missing jack. You're describing a 24 hour time clock. This would, by necessity, line up with SOMEONE's real time. 
---
Which means for the vast majority of the world, the game would either always be daytime, or always be nighttime.
---
Your idea is fucking _garbage_ dude. 
---
If they would offer some gameplay reward for defending it would be nice, or a challenge reward.  Animals attacking will never make sense to me .  Ill buy the humanoid or ai types, but I think its more likely they would try to kill you and take the camp.
---
I'm excited to try it out then! Thanks for the reply.
---
&gt;And thats still stupid, Armor is just given to the player whereas PA takes quite a few mats to build
---
You can find PA in the world. There's like 3 suits or so in Watoga alone. 
---
&gt;they should at least have PA builds viable to PVP
---
They are as support builds, but every build has a vulnerability. The problem with PA is it has multiple vulnerabilities.
---
&gt;I dont spend most of my time with PVP since im still leveling up and trying to accumulate good weapons and gear (lvl 71).
---
You could have a viable build for PvP by 70, but you'd have to deliberately choose to spec into that. The recurring theme here is going to be that build choices have consequences.
---
&gt;you admitted in the other thread that one handed melee is the best for PVP and most people would use whats the best 1shot in a 1shot kill fest.
---
I didn't. Here's some points:
---
&gt; **FROM ME:** It's damn essential to have 1 melee person on a team, but it's not like running more than one increases how versatile the team is.
---
&gt; **FROM giant_key:** Melee is not that big of a threat.
---
&gt; **FROM Robinson:** Melee, not overly powerful when up against an AA Handmade.
---
These are all from PvP focused players. Anyone who thinks melee is OP for PvP just hasn't dedicated enough time to figuring out PvP mechanics.
---
&gt;No weapons should 1 shot, thats absolutely stupid and broken.
---
If that weapon is the perfect counter for the build, it probably should. That's what PvP revolves around. You learn your enemies' weaknesses and you attack them. 
---
&gt;You ignored the rest of the comment about 1shotting
---
You mean that I stated it is a 1 shot fest? It is with team PvP. You're all trying to hunt what your build counters and avoid what builds counter you.
---
&gt;Tactics would be using cover, flanking, setting traps, etc. All of which are pretty much useless in a 1shot killfest. 
---
That's still present. You lure VATS crit riflemen indoors where they're at a disadvantage. I'm confused how someone with so little experience and time play PvP has all to solutions to PvP's perceived imbalance. Because, as you said yourself:
---
No offense friend, but this is kinda what I do. I think I understand the mechanics better than you and could identify the pitfalls better than you can.
---
How'd you take down the cargo bot! i shot it 15 times with a missile launcher and it barely lost 1/10th of its health 
---
Yes indeed! We feed them ash flower-infused toxic water and add a pinch of nuked rhododendron, locally grown at the Whitespring!
---
And like I said, I understand that much, but did you read my complaints? 
---
I understand that pvp is in this game and I can’t change it. As a matter of fact there are moments I enjoy it. 
---
But when those moments happen, they aren’t fun or enjoyable at all. High level players walk in, and there is no pvp, they take what they want and the owner has absolutely 0 chance of winning. It is so frustrating to see a high level walk up to you, shoot you a few times, and what the hell do you do? 
---
I’ll get out my best weapons, and even if I’ve got my 2 black powder rifles loaded and my 50. Cal machine gun ready, a level 100 won’t even go down 1/3 of their health before I’m slaughtered in my power armor. That shit isn’t pvp, and it’s not fun. 
---
Well I do have my pride and joy, my furious explosive 0.45mm submachine gun I save especially for her face. I’ll give it a whirl, assuming violet flux isnt the main ingredient of course. Though I did consider modding a bloodied pump action just for her
---
You think that's bad, ever since Fallout 3 I can't see a baby carriage without thinking it's going to explode.
---
Excellent, I will definitely do that next time I play. Thank you!
---
How the hell does people build such huge camps? I barely have enough "space" for a 2x4. 
---
How long are you guys gonna be on and vending for? I get off work in about 2 hours. 
---
First, lies from the company MATTER, connected to the game or not. If a company routinely does shit that shows their word is not good, that word isn't magically Ok for a given fucking subject. 
---
That "bag stuff" wasn't just a lie, it was a literal _fucking crime_. They knowingly and without notice defrauded customers of a part of the value of their purchase. This isn't just a lie, this is an illegal act. 
---
That aside?
---
They said they were going to have a pre-launch beta. Then they had a few trial server tests, and the product launched in what would (if you're kind) be considered a early beta state. Call this a lie of omission, or an outright lie, depending on your view on what a "beta" is. They didn't do what they promised. That's a fucking fact.  That, also, makes any future announcements questionable. 
---
I'm pretty sure the one where dogmeat and another companion can be used is called 'everyone' s best friend' and it's on pc and xbox one, little secret if you go to that operational vault (forgot the name) the guard has a new line of dialogue so there were plans for that being possible withput mods
---
You just create a new user account if your on ps4 just takes another email I think. You should be able to start the game over while you wait for the temp ban to be lifted.
---
Good question! I'm not sure exactly, but definitely a few hours at least (usually we go for 4 or 5).
---
Am at 68 now it took me a while to figure out how the whole perk thing worked and how I wanted to build so didn’t max out my slugger till  late 50s
---
Awesome. I’ll try my best to get home quick so I can come give you guys a visit!
---
There are 
---
Literally anything with stagger effect 
---
I rarely have any issues playing it on any of my three Xbox consoles. I have one each from from 2015, 2016, and 2019.
---
How have you linked a very vague post to yourself , it’s just clearly not you.
---
Yes, the quest is bugged. You can't complete it. All those holotapes will remain permanently in your inventory and marked as quest items.
---
I like to open all of them and yell “WHO POOPIN IN HERE!?”
---
Yeah I kinda gave up on combating that issue. Think you can clip through windows with Power Armor as well (and I have a hard time imaging they'll ever fix that). 
---
At least one can save the materials by just moving camp, but it sure does feel like getting punished for getting griefed. 
---
I've also stuck with wood walls for the most part just cause they don't stand out as much from a distance, I'm very unlikely to use lights, anything that will bring attention to it. Shame as I've got tons of CAMP plans unlocked. 
---
No it's not much fun but this is the wasteland after all right? Make friends with hi lvls that like to pvp.
---
I hid from everyone at low lvl. Didn't take the big workshops. It's just sorta fact of life there is no reason they would fix this just to make the game easier. 
---
Expecting everyone around you to want to use a mic for communication is pretty nutty in my mind, but I'm a PC player, and I'm used to forms of communication that are accessible to non-english native speakers, people with disabilities, and women who don't want to be sexually harassed. 
---
And "bitchy people" This game has a _lot_ of negative criticism, and it deserves that and _more_.  I'm well north of 300 hours in this game, and while it's gotten better, it's still not even close to being in a condition that any sane game company would feel pride at publishing a full price title at. 
---
I don’t know if this is something but I was also able to get an extra slugger to my already maxed out slugger.  Is this normal?
---
This is another reason I tend towards games on PC.
---
Most kids are on consoles
---
Are you serious! That sucks! I’ve seen on YouTube people completing it, I must’ve gotten the bug! Thanks so much! Cheers 
---
I've had a very different experience, as I play, the concentration of griefer scumbags gets higher and higher...I've been murdered by some sociopathic sack of shit more often in the last few weeks than in the rest of my playtime.

Best fallout workshop / camp builder WW.
---
I donno, I just return after release and it seems like it's still a lag bug full mess.
---
I have a i7-8700 processor, 1080 Ti graphics card, with 32 GB of ram. This game runs like trash, what happened?
---
hey sorry i havent read this xD . i still have it . Do u want ?
---
They even had creator club content of other dog breeds. Also it would make solo play more fun. Bethesda please give me a dog. I’m so alone, Bethesda.
---
I second MATN and norespawns
---
No way there is 50 bags. That would yield 350 concrete scrap. If this was the case it is no longer. Most sites have 3-5 bags. BTW each bag is worth 7 concrete for building purposes.
---
Killed a high level scorchbeast myself yesterday and it dropped literally NOTHING 
---
I've never heard of anyone actually completing it. Can you share a link to a video where someone completes it and the quest goes away and the holotapes are no longer marked as quest items?
---
They didn't remove it. You can check it by yourself, and yes, white bars for fusion cores is a thing
---
He had to be trolling, because it's literally every weapon.
---
I do it and jump back bc if fo3 PTSD booby trapped shitters
---
In fallout 3 there was a ton of good loot in the bathroom stalls. My favorite is that good old grenade trap.
---
So, not directly what you're asking for, but seriously consider getting a bloodied riffle. Even without the bloodied str bonus from armor, you can get some fucking crazy damage with nerd rage, adrenal reaction, and a good bloodied riffle. Especially with sneak damage figured in. 
---
I run a bloody melee build. It's a lot of fun, I do fucking crazy damage, 1 hitting a lot of mobs. But if i'm going against anything with more HP, I sit back, and use sneak damage and a bloodied handmade to do pretty insane damage. 
---
Invest in the perk that reduces chem weight and keep them all on your person, this applies to stimpacks and rad stuff. Same with food. Its plentiful enough you dont need to store food and water. Explosives weigh a lot, mini nukes, missles and grenades all weigh too much too keep in box. Everything in your stash does not benefit from your perk cards. The weight shown is not the space they take up in stash. Make sure all the junk in your stash is broken down. Bulked aluminum and lead weigh less than unbulked. Invest in bandolier when you can and carry most ammo on you.

Random queen drops is the only way to get them 
---
oh, awesome
---
That is a known bug and has been reported to Bethesda many times. Maybe file yet another support ticket with them. After enough tickets, maybe they will finally fix it. /u/Aten_Ra has been diligently capturing all of these bugs and reporting them too.
---
Yeah, both the legs (leather and combat) are repaired with fix it good
---
I went from lagging with graphics in medium to perfectly fine in ultra, really happy with the updates to the game.
---
I mean.. -gestures at the entire game- there are medic containers and medicine cabinets everywhere. A non-nuked whitesprings run can net you quite a few, alone. 
---
I mostly one-shot everything because of this.
---
I had some dudes come up to my workshop the other day (lakeside cabins), one had a bounty and one didn't. Bounty guy asked if I could clear his bounty. Other guy had crouch walked to the workshop so I didn't even know he was there. I told the guy I would clear his bounty lemme drop a stash box for ya, as I was in my menu, his buddy claimed my workshop and killed me then proceeded to say "get killed bitch". You're life must be really hard if that's how you're playing a video game. Singling out a guy alone at a work shop. Distracting him, then shooting him in the back, then calling him a bitch is the biggest crock of shit. Can't wait till they open pvp servers and this miscreants can go compare digital dicks somewhere else. Or hey, maybe they can go play an actual pvp game that requires skill and doesn't have extremely cheeseable mechanics. Oh wait. They're prolly trash which is why they playing fallout picking fights with people that really would rather just give them meds or junk or whatever they need. 
---
Are you using turrets?
---
Listen to the man. I junked mine and took me almost a month to recreate it. 
---
Also had to go to the glass caverns 2 more times to get enough ultracite ore to make it (5 ore + 5 acid= 2 ultracite) 
---
He's probably set up properly for PvP. If you die three times in a PvP engagement and can't figure out what you need to do to inflict damage, it's best to understand you're ill prepared for it and you just need to switch to pacifist. 
---
That said, it sounds like assassin+sentinel armor which is easy to break through, but you need to know the counter. Every PvP build has an achilles heel. His was probably using a critical hit or a staggering perk.
---
Long live Dogmeat
---
Hey no I’m on ps4. I appreciate your response. 
---
Basically it’s just frustrating. 
---
I fully accept that this isn’t a normal fallout game, and so realistically I can’t play it like one. 
---
The thing that gets me is that you can take one level 65 scorchbeast at level 25-30 and win, but a level 65 player is a god that can’t be beat. I don’t often team up because I enjoy the traditional fallout experience, and I suppose that’s on me. 
---
However I’m able to defeat nearly any other enemy in the game. At level 30 I’ve been in every zone in the game, and I’ve always managed to kill my attacker regardless of how high level they were. Sure I’ll die every once in awhile, but I’ve never met a foe who couldn’t be beat in any fallout game for that matter(barring essential npc)
---
So it’s so damn frustrating to me that an enemy exists that just roams around the map, and take a whatever they want from me whenever they feel like it, and this is the only enemy in the game that I have no defense against. 
---
I understand your point that maybe this is happening because I’m a low level trying to hold the plant, but on the other hand, since these 2 power plants are the only reliable source of fusion cores, it feels very much like an artificial barrier forcibly keeping me from advancing in the game the way that I want to advance. 
---
And advancing the way that you the player wants to advance has always been a staple, if not the stable of fallout. 
---
Also never got Mayor's Clothes or hat? Wasn't that supposed to be a reward?
---
I think this is like that bug that used to inform you that now you're level 5 you're open for PvP. Some people were still getting that pop up at level 90. 
---
I’m level 88 and have never got anything special from them, RNG I guess. 
---
I just change mine to something else and change it back to what I wanted. Usually it goes away
---
I never said I had as much ammo as Bethesda stated. Did you even read my thread? I very much stated HOW I traded the ammo is the reason I got banned.
---
You’re a hero of the Wasteland OP, thank you for these nuggets of wisdom 
---
Talk about salt in the wound. 
---
The numbers are suspicious because we only have TOTAL AMMO COUNT from Bethesda, not an actual ammo count. I got banned for the way I traded my ammo to my mules. Not once have they ever showed my actual account.
---
I have a lvl 40 intagating ss dcg if your interested 
---
So....technically an Eastern Revolver?
---
Pvp in this game is an effed up mess of shitty mechanics. Some of which should never be in a pvp game. I'm looking at you mr spin a circle spamming vats till you find a target. Plus, you can literally get on Reddit here or eBay if you prefer to be that guy and buy all the op shit you need to be a badass. Nothing about pvp is balanced. Nothing about it is skill based. It's just what you bought on Reddit or eBay. 
---
Got it
---
I found the capapults
---
Nope.
---
PA arm mods benefit unarmed melee only and because you cannot equip unarmed weapons in PA having to rely on the frame's fists instead they suck as much if not more as they did m in FO4.
---
I'm honestly amused by how fucking insular and protective you lot can be. "the bad youtubers" I follow a lot of these "bad" youtubers you idiots drone on about...and yeah, some do NOTHING but negative commentary, that's a given. But a lot of the people that get dragged by this subreddit post more positive content than not. 
---
This is not a perfect game. The devs make a shitload of mistakes. Pretty much every patch has come with more bugs, it's had a LOT of controversy. 
---
Bring on the downvotes, but ya'll need to grow the fuck up. 
---
They SHOULD be loot pinatas. 
---
It's a GAME, not a simulator.
---
Risk/reward imbalance makes the GAME less enjoyable. Even if I got a crap legendary, I would be totally mollified. 
---
He has around 30 or so parts of F76, right? Even though he was very critical of it, especially near the end of his series, he gave the game a fair try and continued with it until he ran out of content
---
Most of your recent threads got deleted, sorry. Could you detail what you think got your account flagged here? Nikos is eager to try it. We're gonna take up a cap collection in case he gets suspended, he has less than 500 caps after this endeavor so hopefully it will ease the lost time haha
---
+Karma
---
I've got this 3* Vampire's I'd part with for 500  caps obo if anyone is interested: http://imgur.com/a/MNvnQqe
---
There is a soup of some kind in the bathroom of one of the train depots. When I grab it, I always try to sell it as I just can't bring myself to eat it. 
---
You don’t have to pick a perk that matches the skill point you are leveling up before you get to 50.  Pick your SPECIAL to level up, then on the next screen at the bottom it shows you the buttons to change the filter.  On PS4 it’s L1 and R1 to cycle through, not sure what the equivalent is on PC or XB1
---
1. It shouldn't matter what you have on under as mine just unequips when in PA,no bugs or glitches with it either(?), ive had runs where im bare ass naked to save on weight. Sometimes i just like being out of PA to not scare low lvls but id assume if you stock FC theres no point to leave it so id say its personal preference lol
---
2. Im actually just starting that quest but am melee and hvy weapon since both are under strength perks.
---
3. I use excavator PA for runs and scaving bc of the +100carry weight (+200 if you log out while in it and come back, bc a good bug or have calibrated shocks mod) and ultracite PA for everything else. But i also have like 6 frames of stuff and low level for my buddy
---
4. I dont have any X-01 :/
---
5. Im the same boat as you idk if there is besides legendary variants. I keep 4 SS on me at a time.
---
Hope this helps answer, im no expert so someone else might be able to help better!
---
Come to me now. Somebody just dropped a bag of plans In whitespring 
---
I've done both, secluded fortress and communal.
---
Now, my camp doesn't have walls nor doors. I cram 4 benches (no PA), a bed, stash box and camp fire on 3 foundations. I have a water pump nearby. I may put down a turret or two. The turrets are to protect the camp, not farm XP nor interfere with other players' game experience. I do not hide it and try to keep it fairly close to a key location. In the future, I may add walls to protect the benches, etc. I will not add doors. What is the point?
---
I pay a few caps to relocate it, as I explore the map. 
---
You can't stop someone intent on damaging it. Hopefully other players view it as a useful resource and won't damage it. 
---
I'm iffy on auto-buff mods in multi-player games. But a visual timer on your HUD would be nice. 
---
Hahah I do the same thing! 
---
You are so right, the Wendigos are great loot pinatas. 
---
I guess that gives me an idea on what I should focus on with player vending. 
---
I found a dude with a broken pelvis and toilet... in the toilet debris is a mininuke or lead scrap.... as you can probably guess I nearly died laughing.
---
I’ve gotten two so far from level 80 SB and the rest from queenie 
---
Cool, im here
---
Worked for Elvis.
---
You pick the perk card when you level up.  There is no trick to it.  
---
There is a Picklock, Expert Picklock, and Master Picklock.  
---
You must have all of them equipped to pick level 3 locks, but any 2 or any 1 will open level 2 and level 1 locks respectively.  
---
I don't have an issue with crits like you speak of. My crits hit if it's 1% at sniper range with a shotgun. 
---
I pay 1k for that xd
---
That video is 1:15 long. I looked around and couldn't find any part where he picks up the last holotape in the Overseer's mission and completes it. Do you have a position in the video where you can see it completed and all the holotapes get unmarked as quest items?
---
People STILL send me hate messages for playing fallout 76. I got another one just this morning. 
---
Negative, any word on this being corrected on an update? 
---
&gt;You can find PA in the world. There's like 3 suits or so in Watoga alone.
---
You know thats not what i meant. That PA is weak and usually incomplete as opposed to a full set of X-01
---
&gt;The problem with PA is it has multiple vulnerabilities.
---
Thus making it redundant for PVP which IMO shouldnt be the case. 
---
&gt;You could have a viable build for PvP by 70, but you'd have to deliberately choose to spec into that. The recurring theme here is going to be that build choices have consequences.
---
That doesnt sound fun at all when literally 99% of the content is PVE. its obvious not much thought or work at all was put into making or designing PVP. 
---
&gt;These are all from PvP focused players. Anyone who thinks melee is OP for PvP just hasn't dedicated enough time to figuring out PvP mechanics.
---
You cherrypicked a few points that support your opinion, there are also PVP players in the same thread claiming the opposite. 
---
&gt;If that weapon is the perfect counter for the build, it probably should. That's what PvP revolves around. You learn your enemies' weaknesses and you attack them.
---
Wrong, and ive already explained why 1 shot killfest devolves into broken, boring, tacticless gameplay. See last post again. No weapons should 1shot ever. 
---
&gt;You mean that I stated it is a 1 shot fest? It is with team PvP. You're all trying to hunt what your build counters and avoid what builds counter you.
---
It shouldnt be, not all the PVP is team focused either. See above post again why 1 shotting is just stupid game design. 
---
&gt;That's still present. You lure VATS crit riflemen indoors where they're at a disadvantage. I'm confused how someone with so little experience and time play PvP has all to solutions to PvP's perceived imbalance. Because, as you said yourself:
---
Thats not real tactics, thats just trading his one shot for your one shot by camping and hoping he runs into your preferred area of combat. Camping indoors sounds like
---
amazing PVP gameplay! /s
---
&gt;No offense friend, but this is kinda what I do. I think I understand the mechanics better than you and could identify the pitfalls better than you can.
---
I said i didnt key words: most of my time on PVP. That doesnt mean i dont understand it and your experience doesnt invalidate my opinion or views. In fact most of the player base doesnt even bother with PVP since its such broken trash. You as a PVP player are actually a very small minority, and judging by the daily posts here the vast majority agrees with me that PVP as it is now is broken and stupid. 
---
Game just crashed, sorry
---
That quite a price for just the jet pack the usual rate is like 2k
---
Killed her the other night in about 3 minutes. Had 5 people (lv 125-300)and everyone knew what they were doing. 
---
Someone else said it but I'll reiterate:
---
Heavy weapons to bring her down. Cripple her and let melee handle adds. With Gatling guns, you should be in the 200-350 damage per shot range with PA armor piercing and overdrive to preserve crits. This kinda loadout barely hurts her but brings her down to the ground. Everyone should be on the ground so she will land.
---
Cryolators to keep her down. Heavy weapons should concentrate on adds at this point. Your weapons are great but do jack compared to melee.
---
Melee will kill her while she is on the ground. Im pretty well setup and do 2500-3000 damage per hit with 75% armor piercing. These days I can still chunk her health but it's alot less than a patch ago. Don't think that switching to your all rise and swinging away for 400 damage a swing is doing jack compared to a fully geared melee. 
---
It’s not about the game being easier tho, it’s about it being possible to play like a normal fallout game. I appreciate what Bethesda’s gone through to try to make it possible to play solo in an online game, but this aspect ruins that possibility. 
---
I don’t like the online aspect myself, and so I don’t usually play with other people. 
---
I don’t want the game easier. I want it possible to play without having friends. There’s no reason that I should be able to kill a level 65 scorchbeast at level 25, yet I’m one shotted by another player at level 65. 
---
Bethesda promised that although online, fans of fallout could still play it like a normal fallout game, but aspects like the power disparity in players make that impossible. 
---
All I want is to be able to use the only reliable source of fusion cores in the game, without having to change what makes the game fun for me and many other traditional fallout fans. 
---
Pvp is fine and dandy, but the way it’s designed right now makes it completely impossible for someone to play this game and pretend it’s like the rest of them. 
---
Already a long ass comment, but it doesn’t make that after playing for 50 hours I should still have to give up everything I need just because someone else wants it. You need fusion cores for power armor, you need power armor to take on high level enemies successfully, and you need to fight high level enemies because that’s how you advance the story. Therefore, in order to avoid hours and hours of wasted time grinding in the game, you need fusion cores which can only be reliably got from the power plants. 
---
High level players that can take what they want place an unnecessary barrier in the game. 
---
Gee. Thanks. Thanks a lot. 
---
Every time I see a skeleton on the toilet I go "Oh, sorry sir" and close the door 
---
The white bars is nifty, and you are correct, the XP bonus was kept, it's just much lower and... weird. It depends on the creature type and level and intelligence qcore as to what the bonus is. Like you would need an intelligence of 19 to get a 50% bonus on a level 12 mirelurk. I'll correct it, thanks.
---
Dump into a static object (find a isolated dumpster), take note of names in the server, logout/login and hit your recent list.  Risky but no friends required.  
---
Thank you very much!
---
I’m at artisans corner - the main vendor in whitespring 
---
I found this helmet next to the lvl 3 safe (on the destroyed building right next to the vendor) just yesterday, so it can spawn there as well.
---
oh.. was searching for you in the bunker because thats where it said you were
---
I paid 5 k for mines 
---
Yeah it’s weird. 
---
Combat or the Marine Combat?
---
I wasn’t excited for it either, but I held out hope. A single player mode would have been such a welcome inclusion, and it’s really all I want. Hell give me a private server and I’ll be happy. 
---
The power disparity amongst players just gets to be so frustrating at times. I can get over everything else about the game, but being slaughtered with no chance of winning is where I draw the line. 
---
I also try to avoid people, but often high level players choose not to avoid me if you catch my drift. 
---
Wildly overpriced 
---
Combat
---
I’m such an idiot. Thanks
---
Nice 
---
I live right a tiny bit north of there and my set up is made with a circle of tents but is pretty much the same concept. 
---
What's your PS name?
---
I'm sure we are out of spawn block range and maybe we can make a little area for a calmer refuge 
---
The total ammo count would be the actual ammo count though.
---
That’s really good to know? How exactly to fusion core generators work? Can you place them down in your camp now to produce fusion cores?
---
The power plants were the only way I knew of, if you have more information on locations of the plan and where it can be placed I’d greatly appreciate it
---
Thanks Miss Rivers
---
I think it answers a lot of negative comments on the fallout 76 narrative. But hey .  There you go . You're a bot. Not.
---
The regular combat can spawn in a few places, including the Morgantown tents and shelves, or the Whitesprings lockers in the Golf Club.  
---
Looking for the Marine helmet (not Tactical)
---
i paid for 6500 caps back then .
---
Take any you want
---
I have the same problem most of the time
---
That crit meter effect is useless as the gauss has basically nigh 0% accuracy CONSISTENTLY in vats.  But those first two effects are a huge game changer, if you don't want to keep it I'll literally buy it off of you lol
---
Free
---
I just pick a junk node way off the beaten path. So far the one surrounded by deathclaws has been pretty much unscathed. That and the first floor is literally just a staircase, the house itself is on the second floor lol.
---
Really need to know if plague walker and suppressor work together!
---
Yeah I paid $2500K for a jet pack and calibrated shocks, maybe I got lucky. I noticed people that play on PC have outrageous prices for everything, I also paid $1k for all my serum recipes, have at least 10-15, they all priced over $6K. In fact brought 5 serum recipes for 900c each this week on XB1.
---
You, Sir, are a psychopath. I love it!
---
thanks fam, been looking for that for a while
---
I have an S in the living room and an original One in my office and they both have the same amount of issues. 
---
I mean reduced performance is to be expected out of an older console. And the original one is slower as far as load times and such go. But that’s not unusual. Actually to be expected. 
---
Nah.  Most people pay little attention to the free cards.  
---
If I were to play all over again I would only select the first card for the perks trains that I needed and then wait for the next set of free cards before spending points to level up the card trains.  I ended up with dups early on because I wasn’t paying attention. 
---
My original banned one clearly states why/how I think I got banned. Also I had no idea my posts where being deleted. What the fuck.
---
I got banned for the method I traded ammo to my mules. I would place ammo into containers or drop it for my mule to pick up, instead of trading. As the trade menu is tedious for moving lots of different items and I would move like 10 different ammo types. Almost all my spare flux was used for ammo, as ammo weighs less than flux.
---
I did this over the course of a MONTH moving the amount of ammo Bethesda state. On my current account I probably have similar ammo counts to my main. And I started this account 3 weeks ago today. https://imgur.com/a/zywzb3o
---
Next point, if you are duping items, why ammo? If/when I get my account back I plan on posting every screenshot I can. I actively avoided trading with all players because I was CONVINCED every single piece of armor/weapons was duped. And it likely is. Almost all Assassin and Cav/Sent gear was duped. This gear is incredibly rare. I've played for well over 1000 hours and had 1 Ass/Cav drop and only 1 Unyielding/Sent drop. I've never seen an explosive handmade drop. 
---
This is why I might seem aggressively defensive. Because I am disgusted that I'm STILL suspended for literally just enjoying the game. On top of that I STILL get sent negative/offensive messages for just playing 76.
---
Especially when a player can obtain a full set with duping proceeds. What are the odds of finding a full set of these legendaries since game launch?
---
And then the bloodied weapons and mutations to complete the build?
---
The duping was only the first step. The duping resulted in the XP and caps to buy the weapon/armor mods and mutation serums.
---
Deleting the duped items means jack shit unless the ill-gotten benefits are also deleted. The PvP playing field is not level 
---
I’ve been playing solo most of the time, from my experience it doesn’t have anything to do with teams. It’s completely RNG. 
---
The regular Combat can spawn in a variety of places includes the tents and shelves at Morgantown, Sutton, and Harpers.
---
We're talking about the Marine Combat helmet that goes with the Marine Armor set.  It's a helmet/gasmask combo
---
I have a melee ski sword that does about 100 points of damage with each hit.  And my strength is maxed out.
---
thank you so much my guy. i'm rocking this shit all day now
---
It's right on The Snake 
---
Best place in the whole game to camp (as long as you dont want a resource node) 
---
Lol you never heard of Anthem I guess
---
Completely agreed. At level 300 I found 3 pieces, and one of them was sold to a robot vendor since I always use PA. For PVP they need to learn from call of duty and battlefield. Their current approach is completely fantasy garbage yet they let you farm for materials to fix your guns as if they put emphasis on realism. 
---
They didn't know what they were doing.  I'm glad you killed them. 
---
Yeah, walk like you just popped your pants and don't want to smear it 100%
---
You’re welcome
---
Why is only one build "set up properly for PvP"?
---
They shot first. I had to put them down
---
Same, but I had the opposite reaction. I saw the headline and thought, “That must be in the Fallout sub.” 😂
---
Good. 
---
Sounds more like their mic settings are too low or they are not using a headset mic.  Each system has a setting to set the mic level.  This needs to be adjusted as different mics have different sensitivity. 
---
The people you hear clearly are using headset mics. 
---
I think 5k caps is standart reasonable price for X-01 jetpack . They're usualy  easy to sold for 6k-8k caps + . 
---
I'm sorry, you seem to be selling fireworls in the shape of missiles and mini nukes.  They make a pretty bang but a powerfist could hit harder.
---
In all seriousness though I wish you good luck in selling them.
---
Sounds cool, I’ll pop in for sure :)
---
Haha ugh, thanks. Want them for nothing? 
---
Switch servers and try again, I find their servers are sorely low quality.
---
