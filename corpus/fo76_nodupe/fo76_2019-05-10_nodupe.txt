I am almost finished with athlete just need exam and need to start archer which will be easy and need to do swimmer
---
---
---
Nice, thank you!
---
Yes. And then you need to finish 8 possum challenges to get top tier mods for the backpack :(
---
Scrap a few
---
Really? I never paid much attention to how much I could craft. Makes sense, though, considering how difficult it is to build.
---
Oh shit
---
Put 1 bullet for 500
---
Well... thanks for letting me know lol
---
Alas, it is as you have feared. You must slay a vengeful mothman.
---
I agree, but I also wouldn’t have minded it in the form of a quest for the reason of not having to go to Challenges &gt; World &gt; And then scrolling a fair bit down
---
I was able to get credit for it with Murgle last night. Are you getting the little black box with the targets name in the upper right corner when lining up the camera shot? That's what you need to see to get credit, not the name/health bar at the center top.
---
Same issue for me.....I just logged out...Shut down the program and waited 5 minutes.
---

---
When I logged back in they were there again.
---
And they are ridiculously tedious. Probably won’t even have one by the end of the weekend lol
---
Once killed a scorched that was labled as a legendary feral ghoul.
---
I already used crossbows, got the plan from some vendor for cheap
---
Pioneer Scouts quest line. Starts at a train station or get the free poster from the shop.
---
Lol
---
My favorite gutsys were the ones that were never aggressive. Shoot at 'em all day and they won't talk or open fire.
---
the camp owner has to be there for you to inspect anything they are selling
---
The player has to be at camp
---
Was just trying to pay...thx man
---
I think it is the only way, but it might count if you have someone trade it to you.
---
there is more PWM laying around in the world than caps
---
Bobby pins even better :)
---
If you mean a ton of servers disconnects then yes
---
I shot up 10 to 12 psycho and chased it with some whiskey, and now I'm addicted to all thinks alcoholic and adrenaline inducing.
---
Excuse my ignorance but, what is a scrip?
---
They do I exist I’ve seen them just they haven’t been available until now at least I assume 45, 51 and 60 is available since X-01 is now available.
---
and pray it drops...
---
I had plans to become the waste lands first post apocalyptic millionaire. Then the bans started for excess items and I chickened out
---
It’s cute that you think you’ll have a 20% good stuff rate
---
I’ve always been able to.
---
Do you have ti be a possum then?
---
Ah, that too. Good luck gamer.
---
I think the trading does count, since it has for the rest of the challenges, but there’s no way I’m searching for a random fucking Mothman 😞
---
Ty
---
No.... tried it
---
Oh my gosh. I forgot about that.
---
I support this idea
---
Thanks but that kinda bums😂
---
I'm just picturing a player on the server saving up responder plans then executing the vendor.
---
I'm down to be Spider-Man!

Thank you

Pretty sure 0 is in there... Which defaults to 10 based on order, and assuming a standard keyboard try the 2 keys right after that zero
---
Yes. Sugar snaps, firecap and blood leaf with boiled water.
---
These were for the exhibit only. Your results may vary.
---
I’ve fought the queen probably over 100 times and the best weapon I’ve gotten from her was a 2* anti armor exploding black powder pistol. Nothing to show for the effort except the most common ultracite mods and a butt load of flux. I’ll take grind for guaranteed rewards over shit RNG chances any day
---
It’s a cold, hard post apocalyptic world.
---
Player Vending feels like a wild west casino LOL
---
I found a guying pitching Quantums for 20 and Cherry for 5, which is a steal to me with how much i use them for healing and crafting.
---
I got a metric fuck ton of Radaway at 10c each, and after diluting it with Chemist/SuperDuper, that covers my daily vendor trash for 2-3 days easy. If SD doesn't screw me, it's even a net gain.
---
100% cores and Violet Flux for 55c each.
---
Faschnacht Masks for 100c or less.
---
Power armor limb plans for 800ish. It was one i knew already but I can certainly find someone to trade me 1-to-1 for one i'm missing
---
These are my personal highlights, I've also found a ton that was overpriced in my eyes.
---
I honestly lost track of time serving hopping to bargain hunt different shops. Bargain Hunting like this is definitely going to be an amazing time killer for weeks to come.
---
Thanks. I'm on xbox1, any for sale?
---
Why bother with the door at all then?
---
Yes, you only need to have the VPN on when activating the key in the launcher.
---
I made an mistake on the title. It is supposed to say I am lonely and need a friend
---
Recipe that is.
---
+karma thanks
---
I get how you feel, bud. Thats why i take ridiculous amounts of drugs and alcohol.
---
Also you're not allowed to use an item of 3 scrip value to collect the last remaining 1-2 scrip so you'll need to carefully sell your items so that the last remaining scrip is a multiple of 3.
---
+karma
---
Yep. A regular batch of 308 is 21 I think. UC 308 produces 86 iirc with the only change in cost being 1 fluorescent flux and one piece of UC. 5.56 produces double. Shotgun shells do too. 
---
Priming an LMG is about the only way to afford feeding them, and you get a hefty damage boost too.
---
at the Scrip Scrapper thingy you sell the items to
---
The same reason a team would model, animate and integrate a weapon that only spawns at level 20 and only does 30 damage max.   
---
A whole bunch of woof.
---
Third, moved to a vote for "canvas bagged".
---
Hella messed up when moving.  Would be easier if everything just got scrapped.
---
I think u/eckserah data mined it?
---
I’m Xbox need help? I do lol
---
Yeah. I have a hundred on PC. Sorry man. It’s super easy to make. Just google it and equip green thumb.
---
Now I just need to kill a wolf with a knife...where r the wolves when u need em!
---
Is this a limited time event kinda thing or permanent update? Maybe I suck at google foo but I can’t find the answer sorry
---
u/yabvone write a whole guide for it, he can probably link it better than I can
---
This is cool, but why didn't you separate the answers into tabs?  
---
it's a shame to waste all the potential a spreadsheet could bring to a cheat sheet like this.
---
:(
---
You need the receiver plan. Ya get it from scorched queens and other places i believe.
---
Historically it is a form of limited currency paid by companies that was only redeemable at the company store.
---
In FO76, it is the new currency for legendary items obtained from the new Legendary Vending Machines found at train stations.
---
I'd test that but I already have the badge.  I suspect it does though.  Worked with the crossbow (and is great for breaking the crossbow faster so you can repair it).
---
It's a nerf
---
My boy... noooooo.
---
Why instead? I love gang vs gang PvP encounters. Current survival is much better suited for it than hardcore would be. We should unite and express the needs for both those gamemodes, instead of trying to make it everything at once.
---
You are correct!
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm27me/psa_you_have_a_max_cap_of_1000_scrip_per_character/
---
I myself use wood armor and I would really like it if they fixed it so I could have 2 and 3 star wood armor.
---
Seriously, hey would try do this. Makes the game horrible. I got back on after Months and my buzzblade on does 20 damage down from 180. :(
---
This is what survival needs to be imo, I think it would be received positively by the community if current survival was replaced by this more hardcore survival mode no need for another server type entirely I don't think.
---
If the owner is nearby you can inspect the item to see all the effects to verify it is accurately named.
---
If only they can add that to instruments too, the default camera angle does not let you see much of your surrondings
---
Thank you for serving, Airman!  It's good to see the game hasn't stolen your focus!

Building in-game is a good way to zone out and blow off steam if you have the time to sacrifice to it.  Here's a tip if you haven't found it yourself yet:  When you get new building sets, like barn or brick or metal, you can replace panels in-place by hitting the square (on PS4)  or X (on Xbox) button when you're building, then hit triangle or Y to 'replace' the walls, doorways, floors, etc.  It doesn't work on every piece out there, but it works on basic building blocks.  It'll help you upgrade things later.
---
Also, there's not a damn thing wrong with building/expanding a little at a time.
---
I doubt you'll get the undocumented rad resist that PA etc. gives because those exclude base armor bonuses. Giving that with a backpack would skew nuke zones away from specialty armors.
---
Permanent update, so there's no rush. :)
---
It would be easier if you just click on my name and scroll down to Yab’s Junky guide
---
Wait, really? Ya cant? Fuck.
---
And some people are able to do swimmer but some are having glitches with the Swimming Exam at Spruce Lake
---
[removed]
---
I stock addictol.
---
Agreed, I had a shed for my fusion generator that had *no* door, and got radrats/mole rats inside it somehow. I had to deconstruct it to kill them.
---
Why the hell is everyone calling them scripts? I hope it’s auto correct.
---
I usually farm the borrows and get goood stuff since update 9 not even a legendary 3* anymore
---
Yes you can, if you have an Atom Store Paint on them, as clearly, just like with Vendors, you can't sell them with the paint on...
---
I think this makes the most sense actually, thanks.
---
I got credit for the event
---
The LMG uses .308 you might have that prime reciever learned
---
I found a friend
---
Ignore the OP, he/she is 100% inaccurate
---
That stinks and before the purveyor is on line.  I also heard, once the purveyor is here, it costs 100 scripts for a legendary weapon,  "so I've been told."  I'm assuming that's 10 legendary weapons and you can feed the script machine once more! 
---
"Just my humble opinion "
---
Yep, a bug that has been with us long. Doesn't happen all the timt but doesn't seem to go away.
---
I'm not sure if that's a fixed spawn, by I have been killed so many times in that neck of the woods. Usually by scorchbeasts. It just seems like a dangerous stretch of highway.
---
No it's not, because your lifetime max appears to be 1000.
---
Thank you!
---
This is like the only place I've found brahmins that you actually can get milk from.
---
I would hate that and almost everybody I know would hate that. Doesn't mean your need is invalid. But ours ain't too. What will never happen: they will not get rid of baseline element of current design which is legendary items. What could actually happen if we united our voice for that purpose is a separate hardcore gamemode. It would be better for everybody, because right now I'm happy PvP that does not grief anybody, and mostly looks for killers to make hunters the prey. Get rid of survival, me and my bunch will move to hardcore, because we refuse to PvP in world of slap damage, but instead of lone wandered hardcore experience you'll have gangs purposedly killing everybody on sight because loot. If you don't want that place to be a clusterfuck, keep the main branch of the in-game economy away from it.
---
aae and be?
---
Exact same thing happened to me yesterday. So pissed. I just wanted to revive someone!
---
Yeah I've tried everything like that. Spent a lot of hours building so I know how that goes
---
You definitely need to tame every cat you can find for your C.A.M.P.
---
I meant the mods, they are not in the vending machine
---
That’s great but as soon as you’re far enough away for the camp to despawn and go back the lights are back on. I did it a few days ago with a stronghold looking camp (clomb a nearby tree and jet packed onto roof, dropped down and hit piano through second floor window) and was disappointed that the lights were back on when I passed by again. Ridic. I demand that lights are displayed consistently to all players.
---
You have to
---
1.) Revive a Player
---
2.) Complete the Dolly Sods Insect Quest
---
3.) Do 3 of the Tadpole World Challenges
---
4.) Do the Kiddie Corner Waste Pickup Mission
---
&gt; not everyone will always remember to check their map
---
...Don't you have to go to the map to choose the logout command?
---
the people who make those kinda posts will make them regardless...
---
I rolled my first TSE last night at Uranium Fever. It was a max level railway rifle. Thanks, game. Oh well, it was worth some good scrip. 
---
I am liking what I'm reading about the Purveyor so far. As a casual player, though, I'm not too hopeful of getting something amazing from it. And even if I do, my build is 100% centered on the weapon I use currently, so it'd have to be a pretty incredible legendary for me to trade mine in.
---
Well, it told me to go fuck myself and didn't give me credit. :(
---
Your "feelings" aren't necessarily legitimate criticism. 
---
It's not picking. Your build doesn't require junk? So you had to scrounge a few additional bits? 
---
That's the exception. Most players have junk on hand. 
---
Complaints about things that effect an insignificant portion of the player base or are only applicable in one instance out of 87384746 instances are not legitimate criticisms.
---
This is unrelated, but do you know if the laser rifle (non legacies) are viable in pvp?   I only see people rocking the legacy energy weapons (outside the tesla) and those just melt me. Empath with teammates and a near full set of assassins/cavs full sprint or at a dead stop (before and after this last update.)
---
hunter is pretty easy, hardest part is killing a yao guai with a syringer but you can whittle it down to a sliver with any gun and then finish it off with the syringer.  I knocked the whole thing out in maybe 20-30 minutes.
---
Not for Possum Photography. One of each.
---
Me too, just need a wing.
---
I tried it, bashing it to death counts for the challenge
---
I assassinated alot of mothmen and nothing dropped but a pile of droppings...
---
I mean, you coulve sold that for 5-10k, thaga the value of a tse rail rifle most likely to the right person
---
No thanks.
---
Awesome i get home from work around 1030pm est how much u thinking
---
Wishful thinking
---
I'm curious: does them existing as challenges mean completions count account-wide?
---
This topic was about the weekly/daily photo challenge
---
Its because those articles are written by people who just read reddit posts from the day before for their articles. Saw a few rage posts concerned about the tax before vending came out and turned it into "news"
---
Plagarism?
---
Well, you both right at the same time. Yes, maybe I paid too much "caps" for it, thanks for letting me know. But, I am not that hardcore player to check every discord or subreddit for cheap items or price checks. Since it's not real money, it's caps and I can easily collect caps by selling things to vendors.
---
I am simply trying to play and enjoy this game. If I make this like a part of my life is not sound like fun.
---
wait, they nerfed berserker? barely useable above nocturnal? 
---
who is making these balancing decisions?
---
What do you mean?
---
ps4 sorry
---
Good to know.
---
Oh thank god
---
Its obviously per player level.
---
You have been able to place PA pieces in the vending machines? [XB1]
---
You’re mutations shouldn’t matter...I’ve had several folks say they’re haven’t trouble, try my system and if it doesn’t work let me know
---
Yeah, and to further complicate things your pets do a circle around the CAMP device, so it can't be somewhere your tamed creatures can get stuck in a floor or something. So I spawn in the pond in front of my house so my pet doesn't get stuck in the floor. And when people travel in they land pretty close to my Deathclaw, which has probably made a few people poop themselves...
---
Look for someone at the pond doing the swim challenge, they will understand.
---
The pieces did not show up for me when I sought to sell them in the vending machines.
---
Will do
---
Make Buzzblade (chainsaw, drill) great again!!!!! This update ruined my favorite weapon and build!!
---
On PC, yes, remove your atom store paint, and make sure they are not broken
---
spuce knob?
---
The whole idea is that it keeps players spending more caps then they are earning. That way a majority of the player base dont always have maxed out caps. It also prevents day trading. With the 10% cap tax I cant buy something for 200 caps and sell it for 210 and make a profit. I have to increase the price by more than 10% to make any kind of profit.
---
So any of those pieces with the AS paint on them I can’t sell?  That seems kind of lame...
---
That wasn't even remotely what I was getting at. I was simply saying if the people buying the mtx are paying for the updates. Then the updates aren't free for the people not buying the mtx, the people buying the mtx are PAYING THE FEE FOR US.
---
It's painfully obvious that Bethesda doesn't and won't work for free, nor should they. 
---
Except when they pull some canvas bag BS... No excuses for that level of nonsense.
---
or whatever its called
---
Focus on exploration, don't go after quests, do them as you stumble nearby. Enjoy the ride, keep your eyes open, and remember each case when you found abundance of some resource in small zone - sooner or later you'll need that for each of them. Im 800 hours into game and after not needing crystal for last 798 hours, now I do and I'm clueless about it. By 90 hours I finished the game and was starting to get bored. Focused on exploration, PvP against willing opponents, and those lovely little tweaks here and there. Endless fun since.
---
Would completion on Character A also give you credit on Character B and reduce grind time like other account-wide challenges
---
Because some people are just shit at video games I guess

Dlc usually refers to a paid expansion of the game, or at least that's how it's typically used. This is just a content update.
---
Ok, so I’m only 50% wrong, but 100% happier!
---
Thank you a lot for the info!
---
Personally I have no idea, as I only have one account
---
Yeah, wouldnt want to give these "journalists" more views that justify those paychecks.
---
Other players exists. Like those with &gt; level 50 char and not doing 150 scrip daily.
---
Grafton steel is a good one. Lots of super mutants to tag and let the turrets finish off to save ammo.
---
I have the event card fabricated but they are expensive. I don’t think the lower level dudes and dudettes care to spend the money on the recall. 
---
Maybe they will realize what’s up and start dropping them from the SNQ or something.
---
You can't even drop those without breaking them. Otherwise everyone would just get everything in the shop for free. It's always been that way. Not sure why you would try to sell something you can't even trade or drop.
---
With respect, don't be an idiot, you can't sell,'trade or drop something with an AtomStore paint or skin, this is covered in the ToS notes and talked about here and other places, he'll if you try and drop an item with an AtomStore paint on it you get a pop up warning saying the item will be destroyed if you do.  
---
  
---
How is any of that unclear?  
---
Take the 120 seconds it requires to remove the paint from all 6 pieces, make sure they are not broken and enjoy selling them.
---
*muffled grunting*
---
No, your. 100% wrong and 100% happier ;)
---
Wow, it must deal at least 150 damage every 10 seconds! But seriously if you have a build that makes a crossbow work well I'm prouf of you.
---
My friends and I have definitely built more extensively than that, 1 of each thing.. lol. I've got friends that have more than one of each thing and probably 20 "things" from the atom store- 0 issues. Literally, these are places we've hung out for hours and hours with no issue.
---
Again, it sounds like something is wrong with your PC, or maybe PC in general. PS4 I've had zero issues for a long time, especially performance wise.
---
Well I disagree. I think most people that worry about "griefing" are the ones who already think survival mode is a waste of time and I don't think that legendaries are a core part of the fallout experience. I guess it's impossible to know without solid data but I would love to play the survival mode you described whether it's a new mode or a reworking of the current.
---
You can have up to 5 characters per account. I currently have 3 and doing this 3 times would kill me.
---
It's also mutated so why not.
---
Are you able to sell them? I saw a few posts where the 10% tax on 1 cap results in a zero return.
---
I had a few hundred 5mm sell but I don't know if I got any caps myself.
---
Help, i can't seem to be able to open this on my phone. Wtf.
---
Lol,.. that be funny too...
---
My thoughts were a vendor that doesn’t give a shit about you cause why would she... she got all the piles of legendary that she selling.
---
Be great if the vendor just insults you at every turn in a comedic sense of course haha
---
this makes me a sad panda.
---
Oh.. meant to say character, but yeah I agree.
---
New update sucks, rip my buzzblade :(
---
Can’t say I’ve ever had to drop any of those items before and deal with the issue.  Removing the paint isn’t an issue at all.  Just wasn’t aware that was the issue.
---
Now I am and am ready to start putting some pieces in the machines!
---
I did as well.
---
Oh, they do? 
---
There's no point in grinding legendaries below 50. Unless they're god rolls, they become useless as you level up and gain access to new gear, smartass.
---
I have about 5 of them. I wish I could put them in my vendors, but apparently I can't.
---
That bear at the graveyard is super easy to kill by cheesing the AI. It can't get you if you're in the building and a few feet away from the door, however, it will run away if you're completely unreachable. So I usually snipe it from the porch, hit it a bunch of times as it runs across the parking, then duck into the building. Then wait until it's halfway across the parking lot and rinse and repeat.  
---
Just be sure to kill the dogs that are out front in the cemetary first, so they don't bite you in the ass.
---
At least they are consistent.
---
You're not alone. I'm gonna advocate to get it fixed. My build shan't go to waste
---
Backpacker is pretty simple
---
God I need that plan. Next purchase. 😉
---
Ah yes, the 'bug fix'. Yeah, that sucks we're all effectively weaker now.
---
Bleeding Kate’s by the Riverside Manor has stingwings
---
I like to think that the well themed vendor camps are apart of a small 1% of all the players.  I spent the first 2 days seeing other camps expecting brilliant, experienced camp builds, but all I come across is mostly snap and place boxes with tons of water purifiers lol.
---
I'd show you my camp, but sadly I'm on xbox.
---
Good luck and enjoy the caps
---
there goes my Buzzblade char build. I need it fixed
---
I headed over to the teapot - rumor has it that all the necessary bugs come out for the quest but even if it isn’t running there should be at least three of the bugs in the area. Otherwise just fast travel to the big circles and look for them there...
---
Note: if someone is in the circle then wait until they leave. When you enter the necessary bug should spawn, but if the other person kills it, you can’t get the part you need without server hopping.
---
Lol dude.
---
Did it 2 days ago with some people on ps4. I see it fire probably about once a week. I think it's an event best done with a group. Maybe even post about it on here and see if others want to join because then at least you have some insuramce from server disconnects and what not.
---
Is there a trick to keep them from flying away as soon as they take damage? I killed one twice since beta, one time it actually did stick around and fight, one time it glitched(?) on terrain and couldn't seem to move at all. Every other time they always fly away - Flatwoods Monster is the same way for me.
---
No. Inventory happens on server.
---
 I've had several times players leave when Im using their vending machine. The menu stay but you can see the camp under you dissapear. And after that you can still browse, but you can't buy anything.
---
Yes selling is fine
---
I haven't had anyone buy any less than 10 of anything and the tax is on the total price
---
That's true ... i liked the bathesda promise of better queen rewards but it never panned out ... they should've made it progressive, some kind of counter applied to your character that increases your rewards. ..
---
Then walk.
---
You’re
---
:-)
---
Better than when you can’t see or connect with them at all but you take loads of damage!
---
Found a bug in CAMP building. Placed a wall on a foundation, then decided I wanted to change it to a different piece (solid wall vs windowed wall or doorway, etc), so I stored the piece and went to place the different piece. The error comes up: "Unable to place: Nothing is selected." If you completely exit CAMP build mode and re-enter, you can then place the item successfully.
---
It’s always been hit or miss for me.
---
Are you willing to be my friend
---
You are not alone, my Buzzblade, my favorite is 100% useless now.
---
They drop from any stingwings, but it's a percentage chance. You just got unlucky with the ones you found. On the bright side, I think the barbs are the only insect parts that DON'T get automatically scrapped
---
Your day is important! I am glad hehe.
---
Touché
---
The thought of someone auto scrapping their fortune just gave me a chuckle.
---
🤔..... moaning would prob be too far out of place... ya prob best stick to grunting lol
---
Just tried, still can't move the camera in bed.
---
&gt; Let's do math:
---
&gt; let's say you're happy with any type of legendary item and buy the pick 99 times, you pay 6435 scrips.
---
&gt; Would you buy 33 of every item you would need to give 8580 scripts:
---
Do math properly, why those arbitrary and weird numbers? :/ Set the scrip amount once and calculate how many items we could have for that cost using different choices.
---
​
---
I just did it again on a different server. Still no credit for me. I'm boned.
---
I'm sorry for your troubles but if that's a legit static spawn point you're a legend for finding it.
---
Good to see fellow gourmet grannies wandering the wasteland!
---
Green Thumb and Butcher's Bounty are obvious; Good With Salt and Thru Hiker as well, I would say. Super Duper comes in really late in the levels, but it definitely completes the productivity. Quack Surgeon is a pretty fun quirk to have as well. I also have points in chemistry perks to multitask in medicine.
---
For combat you could consider a flamer build with Friendly Fire so you can cook your friends on the go! Charisma tree in general has a lot of neat options for a support character.

Sadly the "specialize in cooking" promise from the NoClip documentary is still undelivered. Here is hoping more people make some noise about that; I would love some point-hungry chef perks to make specializing in cooking an actual utility branch that the minmaxing DPS crowd cannot utilize without sacrificing SPECIAL points. Endurance tree, perhaps?
---
Like everyone else said, you can get them from the campfire tales event (very rare).  Another way that I found out is the daily pioneer quests give you one each, so everyday you essentially get two free badges.
---
Oh well thank you then! Been looking to get back in the game and this will be a lovely post to save in that case
---
I have two keys left and have been afraid to use them due to this issue after I get kicked after my first purchase. Might just sell them
---
You can’t even get prime plans to sell for some extra shekel after you learn them all lol wtf. I just do it for the caps these days. I’m a melee build so it’s not like I’m wasting mats every time I go down there.
---
Thank you man I’m going to check that out!
---
I agree. My inventory is much easier to manage because of the perk cards, but once it hits the stash it's game over.
---
Market prices are not based on items actual combat effectiveness. The TSE shortcut is still commonly considered the evil thing that breaks the game, despite the fact that Two-shot without actual 100% boost is not compensated with its accuracy penalty, and despite the fact explosives took -40% from one buff source and twice that from the other. There are certain directions from which items are considered most valuable, but simultanously there are often more useful items available for fraction of prices. I myself obtained full cavalier set in January and ceased using it in favour of "cheap random bullshit" I completed for 20k. There are items out there which do exactly what they were programmed to do, but the description is not precise, and there are niche consequences of how they work that can create beautiful synergies if played right. A vague example is that bloodied prefix is not the only one that synergizes amazingly with unyielding armor. How sneak exactly works, and what "in combat" exactly means are two more hints at some great items that are severely underpriced.
---
It just got Nerfed. You're missing out biggg time. I  with perks I had mine up to 180 dam
---
Yes slugger
---
Hell, now i just do it for the flux and the fun of killing the bitch.
---
I've spoken with some of the community managers, it was first thought to be unintentional but it turned out to be something they forgot to add to the patch notes.  
---
    
---
   
---
For what it's worth I outlined that those weapons were completely unused / unviable / meme worthy until the 200% repair bonus was found, and if they intended to keep the Nerf they need a x3 DMG buff (at least).  
---
We will see what comes of it
---
But that first time though, that first time ...
---
10 missile turrets, it seems I have less spawns so maybe they get scared lol
---
You on right now? I need someone also.
---
yes, but they don't drop barbs
---
It's not nerfed, there is a glitch causing +1 DR to all worn items, including the players naked body.  
---
Bethesda is aware and is looking at a fix
---
Yes they do. They always have. I got mine from Kate’s.
---
Scrap all junk......noooooooo
---
Yes, the only way is killing a random vengeful mothman. 
---
Most of these badge challenges are designed to be done over time rather than go and do each part and it all gets done relatively quickly. Which is fine, saves us finishing all the new content too fast. 
---
There are a few badges that are easier to complete that dont rely on luck and/or just naturally getting them over the course of gameplay. I did athletics, archery and swimming, all of these are simple enough to do and dont require relying on finding something randomly.
---
I'll just work on the others as i go.
---
If you're feeling lazy, check the SB scat in and around Watoga. Many barbs and glands!
---
You can also do it with railway spikes, which is probably easier because they are larger.
---
And it takes much less time to fire that many shots from a railway rifle
---
Oof yeah I thought so toward the end there. Still, I cant believe 1 DR lowers the damage by that much.
---
Thanks, I'm just really heated.
---
Hi, that is exactly what is not happening. when I enter the circle, no enemies spawn at all, no matter how many times i travel there.
---
It's been a little better for me actually, but mostly in quantity and not so much in quality.
---
I will probably be back on later. I’ll add you. Feel that way a lot!
---
Having even 1DR changes the damage profile, and the breaks between each DMG buff is tight.   
---
Hopefully this will be addressed soon.
---
Same. I think the terminals simply list repeatable quests, and only biv and the scout ones are classed as repeatable so far.
---
alright, but I took out 3 at that location, and not one of them dropped a barb. Other people I saw asking this question a while back, also complained that they couldn't get those stingwings to drop barbs. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
---
Yep^^
---
There is no chat feature in the game yet! But welcome to the wasteland!
---
You really shouldn't believe what the click-bait Youtuber's push...
---
We have a second and third on the floor. All in favor say aye-or-some-equivalent:
---
Aye!
---
I haven't seen it 'active' for donkeys (PC).
---
I have a couple of cards, I may 'burn' them this weekend :)
---
I already have all the rewards but... let's say without too much 'spoiling' that the devs might have been aware of the fact that taking the pylons is not a popular activity among the player base :P
---
Shit man, I'm sorry that happened. That really sucks.
---
One you hit endgame it's pretty much Trade Simulator now
---
It’s okay- you could also try to do the new event at Camp Adams - Campfire Tales - I have seen stingwings spawn during this event as well.
---
Got mine through pvp, downed a guy, revived, let him down me so he could get it, he killed me... I was kinda sad but idk what I was expecting
---
I saw a dead deathclaw that identified as a merchant in the mire by the chemical treatment plant
---
I guess I'm just late then, but still interesting. I wonder if there is anything to be found on top of things. I'll have to do some exploring
---
No chat yet, it's something they've not given us a concrete answer on.
---
That...doesn't really answer anything I asked, lol.
---
They are random. I tend to find them in containers (usually safes for me) and occasionally mob drops.
---
yes no more cross map sniping or back door buggery while you're fighting the queen. 
---
I still got sniped at the workshop today though lol. never even saw him just running to my fusion cores and I died then server hopped.
---
Thanks man!
---
folks are busy with their own shops, backpack grind
---
last time i saw one popped up was 3 days ago..
---
Thank you very much.
---
I don’t even know how I ran out of room. I have basically nothing in my camp, but have run out of space.
---
No sweat! 😊
---
We need the damage back to the base weapon.
---
lol
---
Either way.  Thanks for the info!
---
Real workshop pvp is fine. That's part of the fun. As long as the cross map stuff is gone I'm happy
---
Welcome to Appalachia! We hope enjoy your stay! Do mind the bats though. They've gotten a bit big over the years.
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
I'll try to keep an eye out for it, but without being able to server jump, I don't think I'll have much luck :(
---
Well since I have you here what do you think about temporary endurance not increasing max HP? It seems odd that END would be excluded from Unyielding Sets if it doesn't provide an HP buff.
---
Turn a bag of holding inside out
---
You must be new.
---
Mine started out there, but suddenly switched on after a few hours.
---
same here..
---
and also happen when you trade with robot vendors
---
Sad times
---
Wanna get my backpack already so I can return to stalking the rest of the top 3 lol
---
You can also find some near black bear lodge in the toxic valley as well.
---
But what about the XP!?
---
How cheap did you get the game if you dont mind telling?
---
same. I don't really get salty. I still run at a profit over all. 1rst death in days maybe a week or more.
---
As far as I'm aware they only exist mounted on a plaque.
---
Any review older than 2, maybe even one month is outdated
---
Guilds don’t really exist, but finding friends is a good idea
---
Because I can only sell 2 per day to the vendors. Once they're wiped out I hook up my fellow dwellers with serums for 250-350.
---
Im just repeating what i have seen on here
---
Ebay traders were restocking with new dupe way that hopefully got fixed todays server patch.
---
The way was so complicated I doubt even hardcore players bothered with it.
---
sigh ffs google this question I'm not answering this one more damn time.
---
Maybe your camp and vending machine should persist for like... 60 seconds after you log out? So if a player is using it, they get a notification along the lines of, “the hosting player has logged out, you have 60 sec.”. Then 30, 20, 10 and poof. 
---
Also, camp health gets locked so people can’t wreck your stuff after you’re gone
---
Try bleeding Kate’s grindhouse, near riverside manor
---
How about starting out? Is it still infested with bugs and op  exploiters?
---
Its am incredible game that will provide dozens to hundreds of hours of enjoyment. For me thats easily worth $60.
---
Depends - I got it on release day for the $60 price tag, and have close to 600 hours in it, so for me the price is pretty justified - I've gotten a lot of fun out of it, but also a lot of frustration with bugs/glitches/etc.
---
The real thing is - what about "the drama" turned you off?
---
You sound nice, pleasant, and great around parties :D
---
Fuck the xp, I know my limits, the 3 creatures I have encountered so far I would flee on sight from are scorch beasts, mirelurk kings and sheepsquatchs. If there are others around I will fight, if I am by myself...
---
I worry about griefing, I often am (were? Havent had time to play since last patch) summoned to defend people workshops and camps, and I love survival. The fact you don't appreciate what's great in it doesn't mean there are no people out there who do. Calling survival mode waste of time is ridiculous, because even if you are all for lone PvE experience survival is the place to go. I go there moslty for PvP and pretty much ignore PvE and yet I got more good drops there since survival release than in my 500 hours prior to its release spent grinding. Calling it waste of time, put lightly, is uneducated. I'd love that hardcore mode to be implemented because I value the needs of other people. I don't myself think legendaries are core part of Fallout experience, but this game already revolves around them and if you don't want dupers, real money trading, and all that nasty shit influence your hardcore experience, then you shouldn't separate PvP, the major factor in how game economy is driven, from legendary items, which are rare, expensive and hence prone to be targeted by the evils I mentioned. The thing with low-cost casual survival means that these shitty aspects of how online games work are not wreaking a total havoc since the costs of being exposed to them ain't terrible. If hardcore is to be free of this bullshit, temptation must lie elsewhere, and how adventure and survival interplay with each other is IMO better suited to handle it and not become instant clusterfuck, than hardcore survival would be if it was the main/only PvP experience.
---
My apologies, I assumed you were trolling, 90% of posts of this nature are the crazy anti-Bethesda or Anti-Anything but FO3/FONV/FO4 people.  
---
I took a second and checked out your profile and you don't look like the under bridge type.  
---
IMHO the game was worth it Day 1.  
---
I'm a 20+ year MMO vet, and have seen FAR FAR worse launches.  
---
**We're there problems?**
---
Tons, in fact check my post history, I'm an archiver of the problems, but it's still a fun game.    
---
**Did Bethesda screw up several times in a row and mis communicate with us?**  
---
Oh yes, in spades, but the game is still pretty cool.   
---
**Are their griefers, as found in every MMO (and most forums)?**  
---
Yup, but surprisingly Bethesda is working hard to find ways to give the trolls food that doesn't include the PvE'ers, and is doing pretty well.   
---
**Are their NPC's?**  
---
Well, not ones you interact with, mostly, but it's got a pretty deep Story, quality voice acting, and an amazing number of unmarked locations, the game doesn't spoon feed as much to you, allowing the players to explore and discover..
---
In short, if you can afford the $60, I'd try it, but you can likely find a discounted copy somewhere, if you are seriously concerned about getting your money's worth.  
---
And FFS ignore 99.5% of the YouTuber's, the majority have spun half truths or completely lied and gotten away with it..
---
I find a location to kill Super Mutants, Mole Miners, or Scorched, take all their guns and scrap with the Scrapper perk. You can easily get a ton of steel this way!
---
what did the brahmin ever do to you!!? she was probably like "hi there Im brenda I'm a brahmin its nice to mee" DED
---
I want to be able to walk around and strum my guitar while serenading my customers. “Uraaaanium fever has gone and got me down”!
---
If the game was as broken as people claimed it to be, I wanted to avoid putting 60 bucks into it.
---
You’re missing my point.....if my camp is on the right side of the map and I logout say at vault 76 then you might not see your camp. Yes you have to logout using the map, I’m not stupid
---
Any idea how often you can do the event?
---
Nah, he had it comin
---
Dude how often do you actually need to pick a lock? You're wasting some serious potential by keeping them equipped lol
---
&gt;socialist capitalism
---
Lolwut
---
I’ve just been selling stuff at whatever the suggested value has been. It’s stuff I want to get rid of. 
---
I wish it would let you inspect weapons though. A guy next to me had an instigating black powder rifle that I really wanted but it was a two star and I couldn’t tell what the second star was.
---
Thank you! I was hoping to hear that.
---
O
---
Just killing and looting all the super mutants at Grafton Steel Mill is better than the workshop itself.
---
I tried that one 2 hours ago, 3 stingwing spawned, no barbs :( everytime I go back, there is just some piles of meat, they never respawn.
---
I’ve found the best way to get steel when I’m low is to just run through areas with high populations of scorched or super mutants. Kill them grab any weapons they drop and scrap em all with the scrapper perk on and you’ll get a ton of steel!
---
In some cases it previously did, but they ran into an issue that if you had a temp END buff, which went away, and your total HP's dropped below X threshold you'd instantly die, because of how the math was handled.  
---
(Aka to have 5 HP's, but have 20 Temp HP's from END buffs, when the Temp buff expires you have -15 HP's and die instantly). 
---
Small price to pay to not die due to a buff wearing off ;)
---
I haven't been there yet, I'll check it out, thanks!
---
How much did you charge per? I have way too much and I'm lost on the price.
---
Eh, I can't be the only one.
---
You convinced him, lmao
---
He gone.
---
Ohhhhh yea I can completely understand that :/ . I love fallout mostly for the music and the apocalypse feel and when I heard how much drama surrounded it, I was scared off and after looking at amazon, ps4 store...and coming here to see people just having average conversations, I was hoping "just maybe" things have cooled down.
---
Thank you too :D . Youtubers do definitely have a way with words for sure...
---
Where is campfire tales located?
---
Now if only I could get a good LMG...
---
Ah man that really sucks, really like your style with the piano break in! I have been afraid that this may be the case so been targeting occupied places mostly. Turning out all the lights and having them find you in their bed behind locked doors is just as funny, especially if they start shooing you haha
---
DONT FORGET TO PUT SUPER DUPER PERK ON! Makes learning the mods much easier because you can scrap more !
---
She didn't warn me
---
Bloodied will do 400 and will hit where you were aiming, AA will do ~250 but effectively some more, and while damage is very important, how reliable is your weapon and how well you can control it is just as important.
---
The dragon deals even more damage. But its much less reliable. Its great when you find yourself hidden overencumbered and nearby an enemy sentinel player against which, without ability to run, you have no chance, and you are not even specced into high damage weapons but you can do it with that one perfect shot when the guy is moving, but any other time I'll take gauss, even if I'd have to spec into it to make it useful, once useful, it would be reliable for various different situations, not for those exotic ones.
---
A brahmin lincoln
---
That's damage resist, not added damage.
---
I tried using a keypad switch, for when youre in survival, for example. It didnt work, power never went into the vending machine, I turned the switch on and off multiple times and nothing. Didnt try to hard tho, it must work. On a side note, the thing doesnt let you pick your own pin, so it gives you a randome one everytime you place it
---
Try the quick hands perk in luck
---
Thank you Apexigod for all you've done and continue to do for us.
---
I live in a constant state of missile barrages into the same 3-4 super mutants that spawn. Same story everyday. I log in 60 seconds the first gang of mutated goobers takes rockets to the face. The next fast travel home? Yet again the sounds of a yellow dumb-dumb ‘my armmmm’ during the drowning sounds of rocket launching.
---
So are you saying you can continue to feed legendaries into the machine even after you hit your limit? I'm a filthy casual so i don't see myself ever even getting to that limit but that would be a pretty shitty thing to do.
---
I would be glad to but I’m on PC
---
I had to lock the living room, bed room, and bathroom. Because people kept leaving the doors open.   
---
Come back to my camp once to find a bag of goodies as some idiot lock picked them and left them open. Thanks for the screws idiot.
---
That's kinda annoying me too. Like Whitespring(s).
---
Toilet paper for 10k here. Maybe one day....
---
Honestly I cant wait for this vendor because if people get 3 star weapons they dont want I am hoping they sell them at their stores. Another man's trash is another man's treasure. I really want a 3 star bolt action pipe rifle because my build is based around it.
---
Ad1. Thanks to you kind OP for finally finding a practical use for alien blaster. Do 100% -&gt; 1X% via normal stuff, 1X% -&gt; with alien blaster, and finish it up easily with Syringer.
---
Not the ass hole
---
Westek and uranium fever (event) are good places
---
THANK YOU!
---
The course isn't at camp McClintock. Its camp venture, sunnytop ski lanes and gorge bridge.
---
I have a Deathclaw and Ants spawn at my camp each time
---
Yeah that does sound like a familiar problem I've had in their previous games. 
---
Now I just wish the temp Endurance buffs felt useful. 
---
Thanks homie.
---
Those are my favorite people 9/10 they don’t ever attack
---
Where have you gotten the mothman spawn? I’ve been server hopping to try in the bog but I just can’t fine it. ;(
---
Another mans trash is another mans treasure. I wish I had a log of what people have bought off me. Some of it was understandable but some was just wtf.
---
Most "Fallout Fans" enjoy it, especially if they came from FO4.  
---
You can play solo(mostly) or you can group, you can spend weeks just exploring, days building bases, etc etc, or just run around murdering everything, it has a distinct and separate PVP mode that you can go in and out of at will (separate world), so basically something for everyone
---
And have had the option of Calibrated Shocks long before there were backpacks!
---
&gt; what is a scrip
---
It was "popular" in mining companies, they'd pay their employees in scrip, which could only be used at the company store. In which the company set the prices of the products sold. So essentially it was your employer paying you, and then making more profit when you spent your paychecks. 
---
Paying employees in scrip was made illegal under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.
---
grr not all your fault exactly , but you are one in a long line of you tube programmed A  hats asking the same dumb question instead thinking independently or actually searching for info. I was rude but its not all me part of it is you and your ilk. you tubers are being more positive now and like programmed little gerbils peeps are popping up out of the woodwork. over and over and over "duuuur youtuber X,sez dat the 76 is bettur naow whut do you gais think!!"
---
Deep down everyone wants fallout to be a great game, although I don’t play it as much as other games, I always keep in touch with the twitter and other socials.
---
Yeah a new duping glitch popped yesterday but I believe in today’s hot fix it was patched
---
Pretty normal and super annoying. You have to reset your main router .. I believe it saves some stupid information, once you have done that you should be able to connect to anything.
---
Try using the restart option. It worked for me when I had the same issue
---
Treasure maps are a hot seller also I’ve noticed. I could give two shits about them but they sell fast
---
The sentiment that survival mode is a waste of time comes from the many people who think it has no place in FO76 and takes development resources away from the "actual" game. I totally disagree but I've heard it over and over again on this sub.
---
Yes
---
Free range and AWOL Armament events consistently spawn max level 3* legendary enemies. Also check out the watoga civic center, and Braxon quality medical supplies. Civic center spawns a 3* scorched about 40% of the time. Medical supplies spawns 3* legendary super mutants and sheepsquatches!
---
Circle those 4 things and then server hop, to kill roughly 8-10 3* legendary enemies an hour.
---
If you google it (i dont have the link atm) someone put together a full map of all mineral deposits in the game
---
You're welcome :)
---
Ah, I play a adrenal reaction+unyielding stealth sniper build so I do massive dps without taking any damage, that or basically instant death lol. Scorchedbeasts and the like are all that pose any challenge anymore for me. I had my camp right in the middle of two scorchedbeast nest spawns. I would be killing them every 5 minutes and would occasionally get a swarm of 3-5. Fun times, but with vending it wasn't as good since it loads in and had no turrets.
---
I believe almost anything hidden away can be accessed with just marsupial. There are some really high places like the top of the world or some of the towers in watoga, but there isn't anything special when you cheese your way up there
---
Agree 100%
---
More world challenges.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/
---
I think they should make the vendor items not count against the stash weight.
---
And now we shall forever call her, mistakenly, Mama Murphy
---
Check allkeyshop.com it have a nice search algorithm!
---
I appreciate his amazingness and I did go through it but the silver wasn’t in the first five places I went, it was iron or copper ore.  I really don’t want to go on a wild goose chase and would rather know for sure where some are 😬
---
It was 35 usd a wallmart so i went down and it was actually 29.99 i saw a lot of uk keys for around 15 but NA was always higher on the key sites. Idk why but 30 bucks was about what i expected and a relief after the launcher said 60!
---
sweet I'll update my op thanks!
---
its per trigger pull it your rocking the heavies the gatlins kinda suck for it.
---
How much you selling them for ? Are they maybe worth keeping if people are buying them ?
---
LOL
---
That's rude. I like it
---
Thanks for clarifying that, misinterpreted that a little.
---
Im level 45 at the moment also playing sniper. Still fairly new to the game to be honest.
---
He spawned somewhere close to Solomon's lake, on a cliffs edge. I managed to get lucky and another spawned at scenic overlook and he had the wing I needed. 
---
Now just gotta wait for the path to enlightenment even and actually beat it.
---
70-100 it seems like. They are snatched up.
---
People who dont play online games don't understand game economics. They can think what they will. This is an industry standard. One which I might add protects the customers assets too.
---
Thanks.  I'll check that next time I pick up a LMG.
---
That didn’t work... guess I have to submit a support ticket. Super frustrating after putting hundred of hours into that character. Thanks though!
---
At this point, I almost believe that someone has programmed a bot to post this same question five times a day, but with a different username and slightly different wording.
---
oh man this is brilliant. i’ve been wanting to place my camp near a lead deposit so bad. 
---
bless 🙏
---
Well there should be a couple of the workshops that produce it so at the very least those ones shouldnt have been changed
---
This is intentional so a low lv player doesn’t enter a place that a quest is at and find lv 70 super mutants instantly killing them while they are on like their main quest. When you fast travel to a place it would spawn the leveled enemies and make everyone there deal with them. This will not happen. You will want to carry a junk weapon you can break and throw away for these is what I do.
---
yeah it’s a big. the weapon is supposed to be given out only when the challenge is done in survival mode
---
here are a few screenshots. Trapper armor with the hunters long coat or the halloween costume.
---
https://imgur.com/a/LaMpwzc
---
I saw a game that identify itself as a blue screen. Still fun to play
---
It's a bug. I didn't even know about it until I claimed a workshop.
---
I'm at around 300 hours, and I had no idea.
---
Thanks!
---
Sorry dude, just logged in and I see its gone. Someone must have bought it last night. Wish there was a way to track purchases...
---
the workshop by the county fair north of point pleasant had 3 spots you can mine.
---
 an i ask where your games deathclaw spawned? i’ve been trying to find one of my own but they’re all unable to be sent anywhere 😞
---
That was fair, though you should have freed her - poor brahmin was locked down there and forced to be his sex slave.
---
I mined them, but when they extract it’s scrap.  This is the thing I’m trying to figure out, why are all the other deposits ore and those ones are scrap?  Shouldn’t it be ore?
---
&gt; I haven't seen it 'active' for donkeys 
---
So mule characters can't play it?
---
But why cant they have how dead island or ESO does it?  Where it doesmt matter who's there the enemy is leveled only to you.
---
A level 5 would see the enemy as a level 10 while the level 50+ would see the same enemy as a level 50+
---
That's what I'm trying to get at.  I know how this games levels enemies now but why couldn't have this mechanic that other games have shown for online play?
---
I've been milking everyone's Brahmin.
---
Players can’t destroy other player’s camps unless in pvp now. So stop trying scum
---
Kool. Should be up tonight. I'll add you
---
Shading like that is next level game engine destine and would require redesigning the entire fallout game engine as it is basically the same fallout 4 engine with a little bit slapped on it.
---
Time to scale some buildings
---
*That's pretty good.*
---
I mean you can see my body there where they killed me not two minutes ago; but ok I'm scum for wanting to try and take my workshop back in survival.
---
For some reason I get two mirelurk queens that spawn in on mine.  Those bitches eat up junk when I have to repair my walls and extractor.  Stupid acid goes everywhere
---
Finally got the backpack...I can confirm the base one does NOT ruin a weightless chameleon build. Yay!
---
Yup, I posted this as well. Ty for making more poeple aware
---
He forgot that there are those 7 pieces \* 5 sets \* 2.5ish for heavy sturdy light variations. Those are each their own type of armor. so there are yeah probably around 100
---
I played it today on xbox so apparently it's still going on there
---
Wait, so if you build more shops it increases your number of sale items?
---
PS4. Can we just unequip aqua girl/man if you have it (like me) and just drown for one another?
---
Oh man, an interactive checklist AND it has that adorable bear? Man I love your stuff!
---
Am I not picking up his to play this game? I have never had more than 2500 caps. You can only get 1400 a day from vendors. How do people have so many caps? I can't even use player vending because every weapon/armor is 1000-25000 caps. Guess I'll never get Tse? I can't grind that much lol.
---
My level 2 character with 1 canned dog food, 1 boiled water &amp; a machete wouldn't make it thete

This is worst case scenario imo. I was hoping there would be defined items like the survival rewards that you could choose to buy or not eyes wide open. No server hopping and no wasting scrip on junk you dont want/need. Re-rolling a star or adding a star to your existing gear would have been my second choice. A grind but a good line of sight to getting the thing you want, which seems fair. This just seems like a frustrating waste of time. At least farming legendary monsters is core to the game experience. This is just a lotto machine with strict limits on how much you can gamble.

You do me I do you

BE laser rifle
---
 Welcome to Appalachia!
---
My question is, where did you find a cat?  It's the only thing I cannot find.
---
Yeah water came out when she hit the activation button I've yet to find that plan
---
No i wont tell you who had it :)
---
i dont think existing players can get a key without buying abnother...
---
I'll send her a message if she's still in my list
---
I've been there about 4 times, no cats.
---
welcome to the game!! the quest “death from above” automatically starts once a user launches a nuke, check your map for a large red circle for where it’ll land! lots of strong enemies spawn as well as nuked flora, which give you flux. it’s stuff you won’t have to worry about for a little while, though. 
---
it’s weird that stims weren’t automatically hotkeyed for you though, they were for me (d pad right, i’m on xb1).
---
i hope you continue to enjoy it ^ ^
---
Yep....THis is what I did.
---
The Treetops and Bleeding kates are the places I goto, if the stingwings are not up, server hop once you are there which should populate that area once you load back in. As for the rest of the items, the new event at Camp Adams will supply you with everything I think save maybe bloatfly.
---
Im on xbox and need to revive an ally
---
I'd love one for "I can't hear a thing anyone else is saying" because I've never been able to....  
---
Soooo... if you're talking to someone and they don't respond, it's not that they are necessarily being rude. I know I've walked away when more than a few people were trying to talk to me-- it's frustrating. Sorry folks.
---
Yes. I do.
---
I gave up on this one for now as a means to access the backpack. It didn't even occur to me that it isn't a 100% drop rate. Finding the Mothman and getting the Lighthouse event to start were my reasons!
---
I went with Archer, Mammologist and Hunter in the end. It wasn't a good time to find out the extent of the new Shotgun TSE nerf when that level 70+ glowing bear was repeatedly murdering me. My advice: soften it up first... Maybe swap to shotgun perks and use a modded shotgun? I assumed it would be a walk in the park. The syringer related challenge also sucked.
---
I'm down. Keeler 614. I'm on now
---
I cannot server jump, as the game will "forget" the daily mission and act like I already done it. Thanks though.
---
I amend this statement. There is a headset in the house. Still would like to know the answer to the question though.
---
this is what i’ve been thinking too. she even looks like a babushka. i love it!
---
Thanks, I'll peak
---
How does Nukashine kill people? They can always fast travel back to the safety of 76!
---
If you take too much damage at once, you’ll die outright
---
Yep. I don't even understand why this post got so many upvotes. 
---
It's like people don't know how to play the game or just upvote blindly.
---
I don't think it would work out well, mainly because of how each person's camp moves with them when they leave the server
---
&gt;I'm not sure 3 star is worth it given the first 2 effects are really the "bread and butter" that make the item good or not.
---
If you got just great 1 stars they aren't. When all of your guns are already good 2 stars you want 3 stars for the extra kick.
---
but in your own way thank you for helping me understand; was also getting annoyed how people would set up trap shops to trap people under foundations and kill them with rocket turrets
---
Pretty standard experience for me as well. Stability was going up for a while but the last few patches have been making the game more and more unstable for me.
---
I’ve had two and got both just behind the southern lookout tower near fort Defiance
---
I upvoted this one and downvoted the other so they’ll be in order. Haha
---
I had to start over, too. Sometimes that’s all you can do - especially with all the people hunting for the same thing.
---
But the quest itself didn’t disappear for me... just had to recollect all the parts. meanwhile there are  the other challenges you can do.
---
i have my camp just south of silo alpha (where Fluffy, the mutated yao guai from the Missing Hikers quest is) and i’ve seen SO MANY MOTHMEN there. literally i’ve had three spawn at once.
---
That’s makes so much sense, does it kill you if you die to Rads?
---
I'm not sure how PVP works since I don't dabble in it, but as another user said, unless you're in active PVP with someone, you cannot harm their camps anymore.  My guess is that once you die, you're not flagged for pvp anymore until you two initiate combat again.
---
awesome, thank you 😎
---
I was able to complete this on PC yesterday, no problem. One thing, make sure you dont do a "scrap all" as it will destroy your barb!
---
Can’t find you? Invite me GT: Twas A Ploy
---
Cool, I’m gonna go there and see what I find. Thanks
---
no prob. good luck!
---
I'm...not a youtuber, or maybe I "kind of am" since I do kind of enjoy streaming horror games once in awhile, lol. I also did do my research, but unfortunately quite a bit of stuff talk bad about it.
---
yeah figured that through the snark, but now at least I know why I was being baited at the workshops -then-they would go to capture. Too used to playing ark n such I guess; fire first if someone gets too close or he will screw you over lol
---
You can technically milk any male with nipples
---
I assure you I am no bot, but it does sound like there's been A LOT of trolls pop up here with the amount of downvotes and aggressive first impressions people are giving, lol.
---
Got it, thanks everyone
---
i just spent the caps and TFd to all the spawn spots on 1 server until I found him...
---
Yeah. I rage quit on the new quest because every single bloatfly location I could find was being chain-server hopped by people. I'd travel around, looking for bloatflies, and they were all gone. Next server, all cleared out.   
---
And then the game crashed and the quest disappeared completely.
---
Nice, time to offload mine. Someone said you can find some rare plans, but I will never go find them ...
---
Yes, instant kill for Rad death, no chance to revive
---
since last patch I have seen an uptick in server kicks as well.
---
or her.. as the case may be...
---
I use deathclaw+ ribeye+whiskey all the time , bufftats on top sometimes
---
Yeah, sorry about the accusation, the video wouldn’t load and I assumed you were a greifer, no hard feelings?
---
Holy shit.   So now we can use windows instead of doors and animals can’t walk in !
---
Sent. Sorry I didn't mean to put a space between my name and numbers.
---
In an average week i'll usually get in about 10-15 hours of playtime.  In that week I *might* get disconnected 2 or 3 times.  It usually doesn't bug me too much though unless it's while i'm in the middle of an event.
---
Yo I need one. PSN is also the same as it is here “Arizona_Ranger-7”
---
Wait I have one of those lol
---
Do you have Bethesda explicitly stating that somewhere?
---
The damage is actually double too. If you have one check the stat screen. They updated it. I theorized this was the case for a while so nice to see it’s actually true. 
---
Another fun fact: MIRV’s do the same damage at any level. I bought a level 25 two shot fat man and before patch 9 it was the same as a level 45 daisy cutter. 
---
Now it shows double to reflect two shot
---
I wonder if an orbital strike beacon would work for someone in this situation, where  a trap killed you, does that qualify?
---
Go into photo mode
---
Great base location that, specially if you use concrete foundations to protect the precious!
---
I bought all the Atomic Shop Camp items and i have no more budget, how can i buy others if i cannot put them in my Camp?
---
...what.
---
I’m having the same issue. I just text back and forth with someone from Bethesda. I’ve tried everything from restarting the game to rebooting my modem and hardwiring my console. No such luck. The response from Bethesda was "we will continue gathering such information and will alert the appropriate parties to have this resolved as soon as possible, should there be an overt issue."
---
Then perish
---
I got it on my first try. The swimming, that was another story. Kept failing on the last buoy.
---
Damn, is there any good way to do this?
---
76 caps just because
---
I did encryptid once on a survival server; it was all fun and games till the event finished and the guy on the roof of the shack opened fire. No corpse-looting there! But a good time none the less.
---
Train isn’t too bad either (railroad)?
---
Atomic fan is some work but quite doable
---
I really cannot fathom why they thought "lets add player vending...and not increase stash space/create custom stash space for it...and not increase the cap limit" was a SMART decision.
---
So. Basically we probably lost our characters...
---
Would you still offer your assistance? Can’t find anyone for today’s foto challenge
---
I’ve completed most of the tadpole and possum badges so far only ones that are bugged is Medic: Use stimpack diffuser (does not exist) Herpetology: Craft a frog habitat (crafted one, captured a frog and built it in the camp object still nothing) Chemist: Shoot a wolf with syringer (shot dozens of wolves with a syringer today) Leatherworker: Scrap death claw hide (nothing drops death claw hides, not even death claws) Musician: Play a bass, a snar, at watoga hs, nukashine and rusty pick (nothing works for those bits of the challenge)
---
I can confirm that in all the other challenges for Possum and tadpole can be completed, I’ve done all of them and just now wrapping up on metalworker and code breaker then I’ll be done with the ones that can be completed.
---
How do you do this lmao
---
Horribly designed event. I'm not sure why _anyone_ dumps caps into it, the rewards are pretty much always trash.
---
~~Cant~~ Won't spend more on the atom store If I can't place them!
---
use frag grenade
---
dont use explosive weapons or plasma grenade
---
Should have pushed the brahmin into the spike pit.
---
That’s why I’m for camping plots that are near each other.  If your space would be taken, it autofills to the next available plot
---
I had that happen last night. Server hopping fixed it.
---
Its fine man, just was getting a little fustrated lol.
---
That "bug" was the only thing that made V-fast weapons viable in this game. Buzzblade, chainsaw, ripper? All trash now.
---
For what it’s worth, you’ve made it further than I have. Tried taking the archery exam 3 times (the quiz questions change?! COME ON!) 
---
Said fuck this and haven’t picked any of that questline back up yet. 🤷‍♀️
---
Sorry it took so long... headed to Charlie.
---
GT explodypants
---
Absolutely!
---
This has been talked about and it's not a thing they can just flip a switch on and allow communal building. It's too hard on the game and the performance suffers with just a few camps being close together. Would be cool, but impossible for the game right now. :(
---
Make sure in the top right of your camera it says “Opossum” easiest to do if it’s dead and not moving
---
This new vendor will give you 10 three star legendary’s per week.
---
I have not
---
First try so i dunno what ur talkin about
---
I'm in New Zealand, and we have 3 servers roughly. 
---
When you server hop, if they are not on those 3, then you my friend are screwed for the day.
---
it is the worst idea ever.
---
Learn something new everday
---
I'm planning on doing that or just spending 65 for a completely random 3 star. I don't really need anything specific, so I'll just farm cheap ones to sell, and if it's a shit roll I'll sell it back for 40 or 50 scrip.
---
Dude how tf did you revive yourself
---
No idea? Wtf lol. I've never had that happen before
---
Cool! Does it matter which one I add right now? I’ll add you both lol. Which one are you?
---
Right, how hard would it be for them to make the choice, no stuff which requires server hopping?
---
It is madness.
---
So weird
---
I'm Papertattoo and we are both on currently
---
Welcome! Dont be afraid to talk to people. Verbal communication really brings the game alive
---
That’s tuff
---
Yes my team and I killed her while fighting off griefers the entire time who did nothing but attack us and not even shoot at the queen. Tough fight honestly when jack offs have nothing better to do or gain. Ended up getting a T-51 and a T-45 jetpack plan from the same SBQ drop.
---
No.
---
not really.. its kind of what I signed up for...
---
Happened to me today. I had one of my first customers and had just cleaned my base up for business. Sat down to play for them and couldn’t pan to see them...
---
Been there. Miss the days of fear of enemies lol. Back when I couldn't stealth sprint through the legs of max lvl enemies and tickle their balls without being noticed, and my weapons didn't do crap to big enemies. The lever action/gauss rifle are the best snipers, then the handmade rifle for everything else
---
That was literally so hard lmao I’ve never seen that bug before
---
not a worry! - I'm PC - good luck out there
---
I forgot I just got new armor that would stimpack me when I go down. My bad.
---
It's at Camp Adams, west of the giant tea pot. It only happens at night, so keep that in mind.
---
Good thing I got a bloodied Buzz Blade, it doesn't OKO Ghouls anymore, but 3 ticks is still enough!
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
'Look out! It's coming towards me!'
---
*SQUISH*
---
Thud
---
This is such a great idea. Moving is a nightmare if you want to keep your camp build.
---
I'm gonna add you, thanks a ton if you're still there.
---
My PSN is Alluminati1FTW, for reference.
---
People complaining for the sake of complaining, nothing more.
---
"Oh no, I'm only getting 9 caps for the stuff I'm selling for 10 caps. Whatever will I do about that 1 cap?"  
---
^(Yes, I'm aware this is a larger deal when selling for thousands of caps, but seriously? Every game I've played with a market has a tax system. Even Warframe has the credits cap per trade.)
---
I would if I was on Ps4
---
Gee I don't know. Seems a bit excessive 😂
---
In layman‘s terms yet 100% because you are selling more than you competitors on the server
---
Yeah should have figured that out which one you are lol. Nice! I’ll join you a bit and whenever you’re ready I would appreciate that picture;)
---
Even manual aiming is causing a high chance of missing flying enemies that my power fist clips through!
---
Exactly. When I was younger and played Minecraft, always shut the doors, and as bad as I hate to admit that I still kinda sorta play Fortnite, I just always shut the door. It's like you said, it's just habit. Lol
---
Hopefully not. I’m currently reinstalling the game...
---
If it’s only a 1000 cap that must mean the stuff he’s gonna sell won’t be that expensive so that’s good :)
---
Never seen T45, T51, T60 army green paint, just bought the X01 paint along with all the other plans for it. I pride myself with buying and acquiring every plan in the game
---
Thats some good shit man. I also looked at the prices and recycle rates and thought they don't fully make sense, not every option is worth ever selection.
---
They might, they should, change the prices, as right now the cheapest of that one invalidates the others as good options.
---
In particular, I was thinking Im well set on guns(rifles), so Im going to want armor only. I would only separately want good weightless launchers and launchers aren't a  separate option.
---
And Im going to choose the "random", when I want armor. ? Why? Because that's what most other are going to select too, with those prices. Most others hunt melee and guns anyway, and either way they get them cheaper, so they choose random. 
---
And if I get an armor, 65 is practically 60, no real difference. If anyone ELSE got an armor while they wanted melee or gun...well most like I got melee or gun, and wanted an armor....1+1=2.
---
So since Im not looking for some exterminators poisoner aqua boy combo no one ever would keep and try to trade for, my chances of getting the armor is better if I get a good melee or gun instead, as I just trade it with someone who got that good armor.
---
That 65 scrip random 3 star would only make sense if directly choosing armor would be a lot cheaper than that. But if they keep that, anyone wanting armor and realising how this overall goes, would choose random. Even the recycle rates enforce the random. If you choose armor, somewhere between 97%-99.7% you got something you didn't want and is also worth very little to trade. So you have to recycle it for scrip anyway. But then you only get 24 instead of 40. So on average, the random gives you much more recycle rate and that further enforces it being better option, when you want armor.
---
Those numbers as is are really skewed.
---
2 star weapon are good options for players who don't have good two stars of their liking already, that is good point. But a lot of very active players are hunting for best 3 stars.
---
I need to too dude, GT is MarleyTeam are you on?
---
Uh-oh, 1 steel i razorgrain, this guy's a bankrupt now
---
could just be survivor bias. 
---
I haven't been on this sub in a long time, and haven't played this in a couple months at least. Last time I logged in I was sitting there contemplating what to drop and realized I wasn't having fun spending as much time fighting with myself over what to leave behind as I was running around killing things. 
---
A lot of people really don't enjoy the weight cap when so many game mechanics revolve around having a scrap supply, it feels very unsatisfying.
---
I still hold out hope this game can turn itself around, and will check in from time to time. I'm glad you guys still playing are having fun, but you might not always hear from all the people who just decided to ghost instead of complain.
---
There have been a few people on here looking for this information today!
---
I gave up on the questline.
---
So much of it requires a camera, and if you can't get one, it is over before it begins.
---
I really like this idea, but then you run into the issue where on PC you can just swap out your photo mode/camera pictures with whatever you want so long as you name them appropriately.
---
Yed
---
Lmk if that works. Did you try deleting the saved game files? I guess it only deletes the settings not character data. I just tried it but it didn’t work.
---
for me at 800 plus hours it has been worth it. its a lot less buggy and more stable now but it can get frustrating. kind of like answering this ridiculous question ....AGAIN.
---
😂
---
I think people flooded the market with them so quickly their prices dropped, and couple that with the medium difficulty of finding the materials the prices just aren’t great anymore
---
I recently started a mule and looked around a bit myself. Maybe it's just me but the shops haven't done much to alleviate replay burnout. It's nice to occasionally come across a cheap level 10 legendary or something like that but not much impact. 
---
Plus right now most folks are grinding legendaries for caps. It's hit and miss just depending on your server.
---
I'm wondering if the military paint is just a rare spawn on Phoenix or if they're a drop from BoS events or the technical data quest. I did get the dense trapper plan from Phoenix today so he might potentially have some more rare plans military paints being amongst them.
---
You still be open tomorrow
---
This is still happening? That  sux man
---
Some of us dirty hoarders will still hold some back to refill that bank on day 2.. ;)
---
LOL yeah. that happened to  a group I was in once. she just dipped. We just kinda stood there with our guns...confused.
---
Way too abundant to be valuable I think.
---
I guess the people who do that got offended based on the downvotes
---
Yup! I'll be on tomorrow :) currently closed as I moved and am setting up my new camp!
---
Reading the ESM, Lifesaving either doesn't stack at all or doesn't stack very well. At best, the pieces share a cooldown so if you die more than once in 60 seconds, none of them will do anything. At worst, they share a cooldown so after the first failed roll, the other pieces are ignored.
---
It'll be 75% revive chance if they stack and 50% if they don't, so you could work it out with enough deaths.
---
Great be on tomorrow
---
Me too. Anyone that comes to my store gets an ear-full of tuba...that's my jam, yo'.
---
Yup. That’s what I was trying to say- death claw and ribeye stack, since they buff different categories. Whiskey and rad-ant should work the same way, but I think you can only have one alcohol buff at once. Chems are a different category and I’m pretty sure also only can have 1 at a time for most (rad-x, rad-away, and stims are each their own class of chem, so those can be active at the same time as others).
---
Why? I won’t get to play until tomorrow so I’m curious to know.
---
It just gives more of the crap you usually get when scrapping. It was a thing back in FO4 tho.
---
I thought that perk gave more resources when you scrapped not enhance smell.
---
/u/eckserah needs their own flag as one that people should always pay attention to. Kinda like E.F. Hutton
---
Agreed!!!!....tons on xp and loot and meat
---
I did use them but They didn’t work. Maybe I shouldn’t have had demolition expert equipped
---
Really more a reflection of how awesome some other people’s are.
---
I think it’s stupid that anyone tries to seek them above the max caps limit
---
I haven't seen anyone claim that for a while. Screws from Scrapper was a Fallout 4 thing. In 76 you just get more of the primary material, typically steel or plastic.
---
And if my "guests" can't handle the claw, my turrets will!
---
Is that a good thing? XD
---
It happens I guess, only a few stims and around 1000 rounds of 5mm went to waste. So, not too bad.
---
The usual price is 2.5k-3k although it varies person to person
---
I think they went overboard on the cost of the cards (they cost because Beth is struggling to get more cap sinks in the game) vs the actual rewards. Cap cost is too high vs potential rewards. Drop the cost or raise the rewards is the solution.
---
A few old people like me will get the reference. ;)
---
"When E.F. Hutton talks, people listen"
---
THEWRAITH1990 add me bro
---
maybe that..
---
take off bloody mess / demo expert
---
don't stand too deep in the water (if you're doing that challenge)
---
best of luck!
---
Are you playing with robots??? Near vertical line of players with a top right angle. Nice.
---
lol good to hear a lot less "hate" people here and just folks incredibly frustrated about answering this question, lol. Today is my legit first day on this forum (that I can remember) and I wanted to see before purchasing it...I think it's safe to say I'm willing to give this thing a shot :P
---
Youtube helped me a lot....try there
---
Pioneer scout camp. Then earn 3 badges. Start in the building to the left of quest giver for exams. Then go into challenges&gt;world&gt;scroll down to tadpole only need to complete 3. And then revive another player
---
I’ve heard Musician is bugged.
---
I’ve done Railroad, Roboticist, and Backpacker without much trouble.
---
Just upset that the other guy could revive em but I never got to revive him
---
Will do. Deleting the files didn’t work for me. I’ll check back in the morning. It’s going to take forever to reinstall.
---
I knew that already.
---
Many people really put effort in though. Often more fun checking out their camps than looking through their sales.
---
I saw a ghoul skating the other day, freaked me TF out.
---
Been hopping for hours on and off.
---
Agreed. I made a roadside rest stop, come take a decon shower, get you some of these fresh foods and make avail of my many workbenches, instruments, and beds.
---
Oh wow
---
I've been having lagging with my stash, the vending machines, and robot vendors since patch 9. The cursor stops moving and commands are ignored for a second or two, or else I get a stuttering effect. 
---
Another odd, possibly related thing: if I try to add anything in the apparel tab to my vending machine, it won't let me. I see the price slider for a fraction of a second, then it disappears and my cursor goes back to the top of the list. Then it won't let me scroll at all anymore. I have to exit vending and go back in to scroll. Other tabs are okay, it's just apparel.
---
Try the light house for the camera. Climb up to the top and check for a body out on the walkway. I got lucky and found it first go. All the other locations mentioned (like VT University) are heavily trafficked so you have to be lucky to find anything. If it's not there, server hop.
---
A stash box for just junk would help to with the room.
---
It's my legion of bots, we were standing in a firing line with muskets. Aka the most effective battle tactic.
---
A mighty two rounds per minute, and we hit nothing.
---
Make it a trash can lol
---
On xbox it's left trigger + left shoulder button
---
Very true. Viable to useless
---
The name gotta pop up on top riggt of screen on the wave bit, get on top and take a picture
---
If they were duped, they would stack!
---
You humans and your greed.
---
She could be, when she was younger and going more heavily drugs.
---
Yeah I kit got it to work. The names weren’t popping up. Thank you though
---
Not gunna lie - there are lots of bugs/issues with it, ALTHOUGH a lot of the more major ones (ie: duping) have been fixed.
---
If you are easily tilted by the odd lighting bug, stuttering performance (even with a 1070 and above recommended hardware), and the moderately frequent crash (either client or server), it probably isn't the game for you.  To be sure there's other small frustrating bugs that crop up pretty frequently, but most fix themselves in one way or another eventually.
---
That said, 60 bucks would be a stretch, despite that's what I paid for it on launch day (and am coming up on 600 hours into it).  For me, the pricetag has been worthit, but you can almost guaranteed find a deal on it online somewhere - no reason to spend more on it than you need to.
---
Wherever I go, the bear must follow! ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
---
The economy kinda became nuts when God rolled weapons went onto the market, if you stumble across one you yourself can get 25k caps on one deal, but otherwise yeah it's hard to get into the market
---
I should have clarified in my original post, I didn't quit because I couldn't use an exploit, I quit because I like many others felt bored and frustrated with the inventory system among other things. I'm not an idiot, of course I knew it would be patched, I thought they would reduce item weight or increase base inventory. Thanks for commenting!
---
I'm buying and reselling. Like if someone sold it for 200, I sell it for 250. Profit.
---
I offer 100 pre-war monies for any Bloodied Explosive weapons you have.
---
I wouldn’t say a “guild or “clan” but I think they have an LFG on discord if not I guess just Roam around?
---
What do you know I was pretty damn close xD
---
When you easily can, you should check vending machines. A lot players have no use for mid level weapons because when you are level 60 and above they just stop being effective enough, yet they might have some few that are little bit too good to immediately recycle.
---
BP rifle and a shotgun is the move
---
Locked safes seem to be where I find them most often, but they can be in any container or on any mob.
---
The perkloadoutmananger.ini that was in place for when the in-game editing wasn’t working still works as a fallback. As a bonus it still pulls the names from there. Outside of using that I don’t think you can. 
---
I know it works because I just edited it and it updated it in game :)
---
Did you try it while contesting the workshop?
---
I just chill out in 76, and go play something else if I want a challenge.
---
Challenge-based content doesn't make a lot of sense when the balance is broken. I guess Bethesda figured that.
---
God damn it.
---
They don't, fixed prices.
---
*heavy stomping in the distance*
---
She’s Virginia’s problem now...
---
They seem to have added some new spawn positions for some locations too as my camp now gets attacked from different angles in comparison to the attacks I got for the last 6 months
---
90 rad resist and 40 carry weight
---
Have you done the 3 tadpole challenges? That’s the (once you’ve completed 3) 4/4 for the actual quest completion,
---
exactly. I feel like most of the people who indulge in all the negative press the game gets don't actually play it. That goes for other games in similar situations as well
---
Yes. The extra steel is a big help for staying ahead on ammo crafting.
---
its not hard if you have strength and agility at least 5 and a few mutations. It is a very long quest but not hard.
---
Yeah and even when so, you may need to try several times for it to actually show them. I heard about it, saw the player in his camp, couldn't examine the 3 star vanguar I was intrested of. Tried opening the vending machine over and over, until it finally showed them.(the third perk was some useless thing making it practcally 1 star)
---
I like this idea, very cool suggestions
---
There's a peaked two-story building in the scout camp that'll do a moderate amount of damage if you jump off it. The water revive challenge is trickier, especially if you lack a low-damage explosive weapon to shoot at your feet.
---
This is why I carry a silenced 10mm pistol and some ammo when I feel like going on acid run at the lighthouse event or to do something else that doesn’t take much effort. If it’s too easy then find a gun that creates a challenge!
---
Pretty sure milking the Brahmins has a cool-down so if you are not able to that means someone else just recently milked them.
---
&gt;Did you try it while contesting the workshop
---
Na I was trying to get close by slowly destroying the turrets, couldn't...so rushed and hid behind a corner to where the turrets couldn't get me.
---
Yep, you always see on the map directly who is a serious trader.
---
They will have so many different things they have to have several vending machines.
---
Yep. Xbox LFG is filled with BE 3 Star weapons and the like. Its like they just came pouring out of the woodwork.
---
I see what you mean, and juicehead said there was. It was patched earlier today in the server maintenence i believe.
---
Mmhmm, very suspicious
---
You're in my spot, squatter!
---
😖
---
Ya they stole something from wizards of West for elder Scrolls it's on YouTube check it out 🙂
---
I wonder
---
I was thinking about headed to amazon for it...Looks like it's 30 there
---
Done all the time. We just use mules. I have 60k or so in caps.
---
What the fuck did I just watch
---
Tadpole vending machine
---
There might be a few people who still have it on PC. It was one thing looted from the dev room by hackers. I saw a guy at a nuke zone with it back in December or January or so.
---
Thanks. I don't feel like such a dumb-ass now :)
---
No thanks, I'd like to see the game I am playing.
---
Bloodied builds make every weapon work!
---
And it's **243** damage, lol
---
True. They have some pretty neat camps. Honestly tho the camps I stumble across look like they’ve endured several nuclear winters.
---
If they gave us a separate stash space, people would load up their wares at 25,000 caps each to just use it as mule space, however, I do agree a bump in storage would have been nice. Round it to 1000 lbs and everyone would have been happy.  Also the cap limit makes me crazy, if I get near 20K I go into spend mode so that someone doesn't show up and push me over the cap limit.
---
1000 lbs is 454.0 kg
---
I bought a bunch of bulk springs and fiberglass for 10caps each.  Felt like I won the lottery.  Need to find someone selling adhesive now!
---
You guys still doing it? RunicF0X
---
Shhhh. Don't tell them.
---
I hope the banhammer hits harder than the last time.
---
I thought backpacks still worked in PA?
---
If it's real, I'm somewhat doubting it's existence. But it s possible
---
Yeah it definitely has gone nuts. Is what it is though. Maybe I'll get a crazy drop one day!
---
I was wondering that too. I have 3 characters I actively play, but I’ve only been on one since the patch. Dreading do it all again for another character (probably won’t even bother on the 3rd, he’s in PA all the time. I was super disappointed to learn that was changed.)
---
Camps are bugged right now.  But going out of build and back in generally helps me with that particular issue.
---
I'm wondering what kind of uptick in users we'll see once it sells on Steam..or has mostly everyone who would've bought it on Steam already playing now via Beth.
---
I'm in a similar situation. I want to use the system to vendor sell ammo but the current system is flawed. We need to be able to bulk ammo in units of say 100 or the default craft amount. This would allow for finer pricing. I don't want to spend 1c per round but if someone posted 100 rounds for 25 caps...I might consider it.
---
They do! They drop legendary items! Legendary items turn in to scrip!
---
Oh you want both? So basically you want them to increase the legendary drop rate?
---
For a melee build you should prioritize getting the first rank of each damage bonus perk as soon as its available. Also, Martial Artist to reduce weight and increase swing speed, and Incisor to cut through armor. These are all in strength. 
---
If you're mainly solo, Lone Wanderer is almost a must. It takes 2 points to unlock it, and 4 points to max it out, but the 20% damage reduction and 20% faster AP regen is clutch. One you hit level 50+ you can tweak your build if you don't think you need those bonuses, but for now I would make it a priority.
---
Get Green Thumb in perception for double plant harvesting. I know it's not melee specific, but you're going to take a lot of damage face tanking mobs, and things like carrot soup are cheap and easy ways to heal.
---
Beyond that, you can use the build planner on nukesdragons.com to see what perks are available &amp; create your dream build, and the site will suggest which perks to take at each level.
---
I have a rare pic of a 3* mutant battling a 3* goul in the borrows.. only ever seen super mutants down there once
---
Some spawns are fairly fixed. For example there's only few places the super behemonth can be.
---
I got a firefly and a bloatfly one.
---
On the way. Also if im late i have key cards and we can go again if you have time
---
I don’t think the other guys got what you’re talking about. I have the same frustration as you. Zooming in doesn’t allow you to “register” something for a challenge picture; you physically have to be close to it for it to register. And I agree, it’s dumb.
---
I feel the same way about tse, so I wouldn't hold your breath
---
Doubt it. I've been holding in to some legacy stuff for a while and am selling now, same for my friends.
---
Very good point but then you have to run in to scorchbeast and some people aren't too good at Kling them or are low levels.
---
Lol, I wouldn't be so sure, there's been a massive influx like  I saw an inventory with about 10 of them
---
Yeah Im not at those levels yet. Should look at the lever action rifles, using a kitted out .50 hunting rifle with recon scope, silencer the whole 9 yards. I think its listed damage is 119.
---
Radroach with an Assaultron laser beam. 
---
Gotta love it.
---
You’ve seen them but they haven’t been available until now? Then where have you seen them? Explain yourself
---
Yep correct. Your prime .308 thus have to be for LMG.
---
I don't understand how the swimming was hard? I was over encumbered when I swam It with the swimsuit lol
---
I still need to do it if you’re interested. My username is Icepantz.
---
Who's the asshole that got 2k for it lolol
---
If you swing out too wide on the last buoy it fails you. It's weird.
---
Let's cry about something that was fixed forever ago guys!
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/SXOp4rk
---
Or maybe it stands for "murmur"? 
---
just a bit...incomplete
---
How about no.  Some people’s gameplay revolves around camp placement spawn.      Not to mention it’s an untamed wilderness and a “wild Appalachia”.
---
Maybe the lower the wave count for groups like scorched. But the frequency is vital.
---
I also need help so Ill help if you help
---
cptarcher01
---
You're late to the party. New duping method seriously started about a week ago. It was fixed today but the damage is done.
---
Jesus, switch to decaf before you explode.
---
I got it last night and debated feeding it to the legendary wood chipper, but I decided to put it up for sale and see what happened. It sold almost immediately for 500 caps, so I probably could have gone higher, but I didn't think there was demand for what is basically a Suppressor's gatling gun.
---
I wish I could find some. Everyone I run into is just selling garbage and wasting my caps to travel to them.
---
OMG Mama Murmgh.
---
I wonder if she's all chemmed out??
---
The game is not about loot for me. it is about living in post nuclear future retro america. 
---
I am level 220, I need nothing, there's no possible upgrade for me in the game. you would think "wow that sounds boring what do you do?" 
---
I log in and live in post nuclear future retro america. next three levels I am gonna spend on the charisma cards needed for a pet to add to my camp. not because I need it .I just think it would be neat to do. then I'm gonna see what I can do with hacking robots. also I have gotten really good at rebuilding powerplants and I'm trying to start a player group called the west virginia power company. but I have to pull myself away from 76 in order to finish setting everything up. also I am considering moving ...again. back to monongah.. again. I left there last time because no fresh water. so I feel like I'm probably wasting time. since I cant find a permanent home I'm thinking of making my base fully mobile.again. I don't just want the standard one foundation  floating base. I want it to look cool as well as function. it will probably chew through my reserves but I have nothing to spend my junk on anyway. I have something like a land based version of  [https://www.google.com/search?q=css+virginia+merrimack&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF\_enUS769US769&amp;oq=css+virginia&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.5878j0j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=css+virginia+merrimack&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS769US769&amp;oq=css+virginia&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.5878j0j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) with rocket turrets and artillary. one foundation footprint. the if i get sick of a place i can just move easily.
---
I heard they patched 2 but another one formed
---
Life saver, man, thanks so much. That was a trip.
---
It took me about 6 tries, but I learned from McLintock to wait for the start.
---
They buffed the .50 cal receiver damage
---
Nah I saw it on a guy, but he a quickly backed out. I wish I had one too
---
We need a new sub..
---
/r/Fallout76Shopaholics
---
I’ll join your server, the bitch must die!
---
I put a switch on mine behind a locked prison door so I can switch it off when I switch over to PVP.
---
Any time I do Uranium Fever there are over 9000 mole miners with a bench to break down 30 meters away.
---
Shit I just bought healing factor for 700 today...
---
&gt; I hate that a normal door can be opened by a fucking dog...
---
You don't own a dog irl do you?
---
Sorry. Just finished. Make sure you two are teammates. Then one jump off a cliff. The other revive. Then switch.
---
I'll help you out tomorrow. I have to do the same thing. Psn: ladygame13
---
I scrapped my entire camp cause the whole grass within the buildable area disappeared and it looked weird. It got saved to a blueprint but when I scrapped the blueprint it was broken into individual parts so I could rebuild it, piece by piece, quite quickly :)
---
what? You could one shot people and enemys totally different.
---
They removed explosive from energy weapons during the TSE nerf patch a while back, so that's a legacy weapon that you can't get anymore. Depending on the 3rd star you could easily get 15k or more for it.
---
Happy to help out, good luck in the wasteland ;)
---
It seemed for me (level 52 I think now) levels 1 to 50 were hard as fuck, enemies everywhere level 60 or higher, shit was a struggle i died alot and lost tonnes of good loot. Now after level 50 my regular farming grounds are all one shot kill level 1s and 10s. Ive began my journey west but still haven't hit the bog.
---
Yeah.. I’m all for that, the 1:5 odd matches with the fact I’ve been waiting five months for my damn canvas bag
---
Sounds like a plan, I’ll join on you
---
Not all of them give ore. You use scrap, not ore so you actually WANT scrap. The racetrack is the best place to farm it. Low level enemies and 3 spots to mine.
---
I was at max caps Tuesday morning, before the update. 
---
Now, I'm between 10 and 14K depending on the sales. But now, I have all the mods, plans, and resources I never had before. Lots of value in my junk and aid. Jet Packs, Serums, Matching Sets of Armour. One interesting thing I've noticed and didnt expect is people are buying the lvl 50 Fixer. I keep making them.
---
Some dude that was fast on the market. I had been hunting for it for 5 hours, and just wanted it over with :)
---
Noice. I'll take that 50% more damage, even if VATS never works...
---
That's ok, I ran into a  ghoul that identified as a sentry bot...I heard Sentry bot sounds from the ghoul  and when I killed it, the ghoul exploded. He was chilling with an Assaultron and Mr. Gutsy
---
I've heard people say they got a mounted mole rat head from the bug daily, if that's true I think most of the small animals can be unlocked from that. Is there a data mined reward list around?
---
Level 50 the fixer is awesome
---
This isn’t a trade or sale, it’s a question to the community about functionality
---
Do you have regular stimpaks? Cuz diluted and super don’t work for revive
---
Amazing...
---
If it is it may be a glitch, the list I posted is datamined from the files and it's just the bugs.
---
Easily 15 stable per run at Whitesprings these days. Prime's thin on enemies unless you fight the queen inside the zone, but you can pick up the ultracite ore to make more scorched spawn. More like 5 stable there unless you bring spare mass &amp; fluids.
---
Smart moves. I  went with AAH.  Know any locations to find crossbows? Because I’m out of materials ATM, and accidentally made mine with extra durability.
---
Well if I could do any of it I would be happy.... Still glitched out and cant do the new content.
---
Do you know if it was just for the HR or did the 50 cal MG get buffed too? I haven't looked and can't get to my system at the moment, and I'm just curious.
---
Can either of you help me
---
my other thought considering my new base is to go as small as possible and see how efficent I can make it.
---
Which part's glitching on your end?
---
Wow. Just looked at the side by side comparison. This more poorly done then the time I plagarized Chance's Folly and changed the words around to turn it in for a highschool Mythology project lmao.
---
Never really tried. Farmed some occasinally, specially when it was posssible to just stand next to WS golf club and do it over and over.
---
Do something you like doing in the game. Or if F76 doesn't provide it, find one that does. 
---
Fallout has always(well so far) been single player pure PvE experience. Last years November didn't all of a sudden turn it upside down.
---
That sucks. Can i get a look at that? Was hoping there were more plans than I have so far.
---
I enjoyed the tse high damage like you enjoyed v fast weapons with high damage. I would be fine with bring back tse damage and vfast damage but only in over mode. In pvp mode keep it needed
---
what's over mode
---
I believe it was just the receiver for the Hunting rifle for this patch
---
Hey! 
---
After going into bios and turning off the turbo technology, I no longer get the stutter!!! So it worked for me.
---
That’s great and all. But when I scrap all why am I still scrapping bulk?!?
---
Why am I still scrapping bulk during scrap all!!?
---
Psn mynamiznik
---
I guess but the Bowie knife is the weakest of the knives so that’s a waste it should’ve been for the combat knife &amp; the mounted heads is old dlc plans put into the new stuff so meh. I want new &amp; new only, not old mounted head plans from 2 content updates ago :-/
---
I cant get the frog habit stuff as the quest started started part way when it popped up for me a few weeks ago..
---
Now cant get the quest for clean up amd bugs to pop up
---
Just fire up XEdit, then go back in the referenced list. D01C_StingsAndThings_LLS_Quest_Reward_Taxidermy is the level list you want, and it only has those 6
---
son of fluffy 
---
keeps spawning at mine
---
It’s for the Metal challenge badge.  I don’t want scrap you need to smelt ore for it.  It’s all good I figured it out.  Thanks!
---
Doing the possum challenges and completing the two new dailies and new event.
---
2 hours so far, one possum coin....siiiigh
---
U too
---
I believe it cost 2 Tadpole Badges at one of the machines
---
That ain’t a fiddle. 
---
[This is a fiddle!](https://twitter.com/idmachina/status/1126674219209768960?s=21)
---
Did you already do the Cleanup and Bug quest once? If so you're all good at least for the main thing, it only requires it once. Go talk with the counselors to see if they're ready for you again though, the dailies don't autofire in your log.
---
As for the habitat, yeah it's bugged. That route can't be completed until they fix it.
---
Wait, does this reward coins for a backpack too, or only mods?
---
I'm on PS4. Is there a screengrab online somewhere?
---
Event?
---
I've sold a bunch of bobbleheads for 100c each. I sell magazines for 15-100 depending on how useful they are, and treasure maps for 15-30 depending on the region.
---
A wise desision. 
---
You can make entirely different kind of build you would stuggle to make with your first. While levelling it slower you now know many shorcuts.
---
For the purveyor/scrip Im glad I have level 57 alt so I can dump 300 scrip a day.
---
Searching works fine so why complicate things :p
---
Go to Camp Adams at night above the Nuka Cola Plant.
---
Campfire Tales at Camp Adams. Triggers at night.
---
They give you barn walls and stuff iirc. When I used the plan it unlocked several things to use but I had to get off for maint this morning lol. There is also a brick set that I wanna get.
---
I can't say I do, but one of the faction vendors sells the plan! I'd check at Whitesprings, I'm sure it's there somewhere!
---
Even at a high level, you will die a bunch of times during Encryptid. You sounded like you were doing pretty well, I don't think you should have left. I bet high level players were fast traveling in to help you and you left!
---
He was in a bind
---
because he was way behind
---
[and that damn bus is taking forever ](https://twitter.com/idmachina/status/1126674721662275584?s=21)
---
Ha- yes, I just "fell" 4 stories when someone was disconnected or logged out, then I fast traveled to another camp that was gone when I got there.  
---
Of course, other times I've spawned stuck in walls, inside foundations, in a locked part of the camp (no exit without lockpicking).... and then my favorite-- I spawned stuck in someone's foundation while 3 scorchbeast attacked me... or maybe it was the camp. I couldn't attack back without damaging the camp-- finally managed to pull out my power armor and enter it to get unstuck. Almost died three times in that little episode.  
---
Quite a few little glitches, but I'm loving player vending overall.
---
Adventure mode sorry autocorrect messes up allot
---
I absentmindedly jump on most buildings with marsupial but some I ignore because of their size. No longer shall that be the case
---
Totally agree. Add it in Adventure
---
I clearly didn't absorb what you wrote... Apologies, no. I couldn't tell you, sadly!
---
You don't know what they have until you get there, so walking is unreasonable unless they're nearby. OP makes a solid point.
---
Nice work, lads.
---
Lol.... I scrap or sell ALL my legendary weapons.   Just have not found any worth a hoot.
---
Mystery pick should be a random starred pickaxe
---
I cant do the clean up or bug quest I have the tadpole quest to go to them but the repeatable quest you actually do doesnt pop up.
---
As for the frog I never talked to the scout master so I dont even have plans to make a frog jar or habits.
---
Yep, happens to everyone.
---
I want an oops emote
---
Me: accidentally hits someone from Tesla rifle
---
Me: WAIT COME BACK IM NOT TRYING TO KILL YOU
---
Me: :(
---
From the picture in "in the vault", you'll get a random 3* ranged or melee weapon for 100 scrip turned in. So with a 1K limit, you could get 10 3* weapons out... I'd hope at least one would be a solid usable one!
---
I use them because they don't cause screen shake like missile turrets.
---
I've been running into a small group of people running what iassumed was mostly tse legacies.  One of the guys was melting us at crazy range 100+ ft. We checked on an adventure server.  Is there some sort of effect explosives has that extends the range and delays the damage drop off?  I tried scaling a bloodied laser rifle to that degree and it just doesn't work.
---
Nope. This was apparently a mistake according to the patch notes.
---
A mistake that makes no sense when backpacks provide functionality not just carry weight. I'm looking at you fridge backpack.
---
You can also shoot them into eachother to make a bridge. I need to do some testing but I got at least three to stack before getting distracted
---
On your server, good luck in there. My cryolator is ready to freeze the Queen to the ground for us
---
Ok I have knockes out the mammal hunter archery athletic swimming and it seems I can now do the camp fire stories event.  This apparently has a 50%  chance to give merit badges. Hoping I can use those to get the back pack.
---
What are the scout challenges? I can’t find them
---
Buyers remorse will do that
---
Don't throw woof into this, it deserves better.
---
Thanks y’all! I’m in site alpha with a bunch of people helping me, should be launching it soon
---
You go into your player map, go to the menu on the left. It’s under challenges. When you get there, scroll down to world. It’s inside that massive list.
---
Oh, I didn’t think to literally check challenges lmao
---
Dude. Nothing happened...
---
Right? I was waiting for events to pop up lol
---
Heck make ass/ sent back to what it used to be to. Let people have fun in adventure mode the way they want and if people want to pvp let Bethesda nerf their damage all they want. Make it so you lose a lot of aid and caps when you die to make them happy.
---
When can we expect the broken badges to be fixed? Musician doesnt tally when playing instruments or when playing at the Nukashine,
---
Lab Coat did not register after putting it on or acquiring it, frog habitat doesnt checkmark &amp; I’ve made at least 12 of them, Sugar Bombs dont even show up in ingredients list even though I have 17 boxes to craft sweet rolls &amp; s’mores, and those are  just the few I’ve found &amp; put Bethesda Support onto via Twitter.
---
Also, and this has been reported RIGHT AFTER LAUNCH, Discovery for Grafton, Mire, &amp; Cranberry Bog do NOT complete because Grafton Dam, Valley Galleria, &amp; Cranberry Glade do not give credit even after making several new characters and discovering/rediscovering.
---
Y’all can hire me to test content before release, I think I’ve already done a better job finding broken content &amp; bugs than the whole of Bethesda combined in my over 1000 hours gameplay.
---
2 skins when you get it and one from atom shop
---
Or if you could just go into the settings and make a change to last for the next 2 minutes only.
---
Category is called "COLLECTIONS"
---
Even if someone has nothing I really want, I still buy something. Especially if they're just standing there looking at my character lol.
---
Both times I fast traveled there a Yao Guai was patrolling the entrance

Return Of The Dupe
---
a tip I have learned in spending (quite a lot of time) building different camps is that floors and roofs consume a huge amount of cumulative budget. I've got it down where I can build camps that look relatively big with multiple buildings and have everything I need and  lots of decorations.
---
No just skins from what I hear
---
Shameless plug for /r/TVChernobyl
---
Just kill it
---
This is what I do too. Just idle in photo mode and you can see everything
---
It was 2 different ones
---
PPV? Also, what platform?
---
I heard that!!!
---
Funner*
---
Take radiation damage till a sliver of health remains
---
Then take a big fall
---
Spruce knob has a big enough cliff at it, just above the hidden cave
---
Easy to get revive in water and revive at the same time
---
Just send me a friend request when ready and I'll be there when I can.
---
Funner is not a word.
---
Damn
---
Ya, it didn't for me.  Must be another one of those bugs that's so common in this game.
---
What?  Now I'm gonna go check.  If you're trolling me, *well played*, and you truly deserve to win the Playa Hater's Ball, SilkyJohnson.
---
Ok tomorrow I’ll hit u up tomorrow then !!!!
---
Potentially Same issue on Xbox lets me log into my side characters but not my main character with everything on it
---
I want the accordion junk item to be playable anywhere
---
Yeah, all the 'take a picture of' objectives were busted on my end. Luckily I found a workaround, but it pissed me off to no end for a while.
---
I think lock picking should be tied to your perception stat, not equipped cards. That way you need to either invest in it to open harder and harder locks, or have a buddy around to do it. Same for Int/hacking imo
---
I highly doubt the level will be random.
---
It IS fucking unreal. Being taxed is unreal. In real life. In this game. Anywhere. Jesus. That's why the insult "cuck" has become so prominent, as it's a once-removed cousin from "tax me, daddy, I need you to take from me." You're a fucking idiot if you are pleased about being coerced to do something. And people that argue it's to even out the economy are fucking stupid. Everything is just 10% lower. Still the same lack of parity. Christ, people are ACTUALLY defending theft against themselves. In real life there are at least some arguments for it. In this game there isn't. The game studio does not run off of in-game caps. It makes zero difference. I swear I'm dreaming.
---
I got invited by someone last week who popped the quest 5x on different servers. We only beat it twice, got crap loot, and people still refused to take pylons or work together to beat it. He gave up after putting so many caps into it and I cant say I blame him. 
---
I think for a n event that spawns so many 4obots in addition to a pretty difficult "boss" and requires coordination with random people, the cost isnt worth the reward.
---
There's 2 machines that I see at the camp, one takes tadpole and the other possum. The tokens are listed under world in challenges. The 4th tadpole complete gave me 4 tokens.
---
if i meet someone that needs a serum that i can make i ask them only for flux in return, they usually have a lot and nothing to do with it so i end up with a lot of flux.
---
The deathclaw skin rug? definitely exists. Deathclaw hide exists, is either of these what you're talking about?
---
Yeah, those were from hackers getting into the dev room. Check the date on the uploads- that was in January. 
---
The flames armor made it in game for like a day (flash sale on atom shop). The other armors have never been legitimately available.
---
Don't listen to that tool bag. 90% of the shit he's complaining about is either false info or not as bad as he says.
---
50 cal bullets do more damage now on hunting rifles
---
Needs melee build to smack unappreciative youngsters with a cane
---
Can also get stingwings at the free range events, and the new event at camp Adam's. 
---
Flatwoods has a few radroaches too.
---
I have one I use solely for playing darts with.
---
Excuse me, you forgot about the Long Pew.
---
Yes I know they were dev room items I just assume they’re available in some way since X-01 is available and I’m wondering if anyone has gotten them yet.
---
Right now, nuke zones are exclusive to either hazmat suits (leaving you defenseless) or power armor. So effectively it's just something for PA users, which is kinda weird considering how many perks are in the game for non-PA users. Why wall off endgame content to only one style of play?
---
Thank you! Pity it's just 90, but glad I have the numbers now.
---
I've sold them for 25-50 caps each, but I had waaay too many and wanted them off of my hands.
---
Went into Tuesday with 25,000 caps.  
---
Logged out today with under 3000.  
---
Great update but man, my wallet is \*feeling\* it. Gotta get back into teh daily salesgrind but my statsh is overfilled with unsellable Things now. Ack!
---
I haven’t gotten to that point but I would assume you can’t sell it could try tho
---
yeah generally my opinion would in fact make sense to me.  thanks for clearing that up. 
---
+karma for that awesome comment.
---
I can only load into my side characters my main character with everything on it disconnects instantly
---
i typed the same thing in.  The articles i see are close to a year old.  Thought someone who frequently kept up with the game could help me out.   Is the type of question I wouldnt mind answering.
---
Yup just today I ran into a legendary glowing ghoul in the middle of nowhere which was really weird, I killed it and went to look it and the thing exploded like a nuke. Was pretty annoying because the body was nowhere to be found.
---
Are you wearing armor with weight reducing perks
---
I assumed not either. I figured that it was probably like those medical and ammo vending machines.
---
I left with about a minute on the clock left. No one was around me.
---
I just lost like 60 some gears 30 some ultracite tons of circuitry. 😠.......Got attacked by 3 Yao Guai with  a broke shotgun encumbered dehydrated. And not in power armor.  Died.  Respawned killed all 3 with my 10mm Storm* ... Collected there meat for some stew then got dropped from server before being able to collect my bag of junk😠😠😠😠😠
---
Charleston herald headquarters. Go to the top, jump off from the suspension bridge into the water below and have a team mate waiting in the water to revive you. Super easy there.
---
Same thing here. I texted with tech support and nothing they suggested worked. Hopefully our main characters are able to load in tomorrow...
---
I might be, but it’s still weird I’m going from 306 to 366 right? Or is my math totally off?
---
Yes I figured that out. Thank you very much.
---
I'd love a bunch more emotes for situations.  Laughing, pointing, maybe even one for bugged haha
---
Damn @work again....goodluck!
---
Lol I use the throwing knives for darts
---
And most of what im seeing says "maybe".  So information that is months old and says "maybe" might not be the most accurate information available.
---
Jump from the suspension bridge at Charleston herald hq. The person needs to be in the water also for it to count.
---
I just had one do that for the first time. I’m at... a playtime number that I don’t even want to repeat. But yeah. It happens.
---
I have done three SBQ events.  The first one half the people were jsut sitting back doing nothing, some were trading with each other.  Complete waste.  The second we got her down to just below half and she did exactly this.  The third, just a hour ago, finally completed it.  Got a sweet 3\* Death Tambo which I will trade in for scripts as soon as I can....
---
He was spam scrapping and (at around the 18s mark like he said) the window for "are you sure you want to scrap this favorited item?" popped up for a split second.
---
Looking at it even closer, you can also see that there's 0 favorited items showing in the list of weapons he was scrapping, meaning that this is indeed some sort of UI bug.
---
Thank you, I've seen some for 20 and 100 a stack of bulk
---
Are you saying you have seen robot armor plans on vendors since the patch? They’ve never been on any vendor previously; just a rare world drop/quest reward.
---
this is a great idea actually cuz they weight nothing and  have 1 cap value so we could just sell it to the bots whenever we need
---
Don't recall ever seeing something called a "stimpack diffuser" in any workbench from as far back as beta personally.
---
This happened when I pacified the queen
---
Awesome
---
I'm fairly certain most gamers have mics. Most people don't like to talk or even play with each other... What a time.
---
Not bad, especially since they buffed .50 rounds for hunting rifles. My lever action does about 275 per shot and shoots about 50% faster than hunting rifles. Plus it's 3x legendary for armor pierce and explosive. With 3.5x sneak attack at night with perks plus about 85% armor piercing it's pretty hard on enemies lol
---
Many of these location specific pictures are working if you get right up on it and take the picture.  The camera has to register the location by displaying it's name in the top right corner of the screen when viewing through the camera.    
---
Walk out onto the bridge itself and then try pointing the camera directly at the road or somewhere up underneath it while you're right up next to it.
---
This isn't new. It's been happening for a decent while and there's nothing you can do to fix it. 
---
You lost out on the items, welcome to the club
---
I have reached max and then went broke from buying either vendor plans or stuff from players multiple times since the update. It's quite impressive, honestly
---
responded in post
---
Im case you dont have marsupial or you just wanna get that high lmao
---
Happy climbing!
---
Jeez.
---
Torrents and purifiers, likely.
---
9/10.
---
For real I made 25k+ caps for the first time because I’ve been saving up all the legendaries and serums, I guess I’m gonna start my backup characters lol
---
Haha wow I’m gunna try it right now !
---
This has been requested for more than six months now. It's prolly good to have differernt people asking for it so the devs see it. But it's been on the radar a very, very long time.
---
What would be nice is for Beth to provide any feedback now that it's been over six months. If they're not going to address it, at least promise not to ban us for using addons that do it instead.
---
This game isn't "close to a year old". Most of those posts are from last year and, here's the kicker... They're _valid_ because you're asking questions for _old ass shit_. 
---
We left beta MONTHS ago. Of course the answers to that question will be old. 
---
googling fallout 76 survival can get you _survival mode fucking youtube content_.
---
That’s fair.
---
It's there. And thanks for the idea, I'm gonna start selling those in my vending machine now!
---
There are some leak videos where this event name was linked to Arktos Pharma
---
No exploiters really but def bugs
---
Did you even watch the video?
---
That's why I specifically said when it happened.
---
People have been complaining about disappearing items for a while now, but I'm just trying to help determine a cause, for the community and the devs sake.
---
well in whitespring you get 3 x 3 star legendary drops without a nuke, that's 120 LS from 1 run (assuming someone didn't clear them). You then go to the vendor and for 1 week of work you get 10 random drops, that you will probably sell. After unyielding and a good meele explosive is all you need, a instigating explosive would be better, I've been farming for months and I got A LOT of crap a few instigating weapons and 0 explosives. I got my first explosive out of a vending machine 2 days ago....so here is the thing, if you have a random drop legendary why make it a store. To make things worse assuming you get 3 stars and sell them for 40 you will pay 100 and get 40 back, but the currency itself is caped at 1k. so if starting on 0 you get 150 then buy one weapon, then the next day you sell it for 40, farm adn get 2 weapons, then the third day back to one...it's a really terible system considering the effort, let us pick one of the 3 at least Jeasus, talk about boring, I rather just keep farming whitespring (nerfed as it is). Since it's random the chances to get something better get really slim. If you can't pick explosive and hope for instigating, there is 0 chance to get either with random drops, and you need a shotgun, not a pistol or any other weapon. I didn't even get an explosive pistol yet, the chances of randomize loot need to be somewhat helpfull. What's the point of geting a random ranged weapon with 3 stats. if it's not shotgun it sucks, if it's not explosive-instigating or double shot, it sucks, if it's level is not 45-50 it sucks, sll these things have similar chances to winning the lotery. Considering how much time I spent farming never to get an explosive shotgun of anykind I don't see the point of a random vendor. Bethesda you need to consider letting us build the weapon/armor at least in part and have 2 random rolls rather then coin toss weapn, stats, lvl, it's just pointless otherwise, I have half the chances in whitespring and I'm not limited to 1-2 trys per day there, past lvl 100 there si really nothing else- we own all the PA - or can get with ease, at least 1 unyielding set, that we rarely wear for the queen, a good fireaxe that we make doand all we lack is that 1 OP ranged shotgun. Some ppl make it work with a two shot dragon, but overall why have a leg store if you can't influence it's stats, how am I supposed to get a build...
---
Thank you.
---
You in Texas?
---
Shot mine (Lvl 16 stunted) with a crossbow twice knocked it to about 20% then I punched it until it was at about 2% then fired my blank syringes at it
---
I’ve been pricing that stuff at about half of face value. It’s less than they’d pay at a vendor and more than I’d get, so everybody wins.
---
Hm.  Not sure about the holotape, but I'm pretty sure that kidsecure ID is for a quest at Wavy Willards.
---
Yup. This game is a buggy shitshow. 
---
-watches downvotes roll in, as I wait for the six minute and counting fast travel to finish-
---
I'm waiting for the ones from somebody going for a 3* melee weapon hoping for something great for their 2 handed melee character and ending up with a godly set of legendary abilities, but they're on some joke of a 1 handed weapon like a switch blade.
---
The survival mode is currently in beta.   I was simply replying to your directions to Google a certain phrase.
---
I'd prefer a text chat.
---
I hate the sound of mine own voice and would loathe to subject anyone to it.
---
Same....and most of the scout challengers need pictures......ughh
---
Happened to me with my vintage nukashine label. Gone from my inventory and just laying in the ground. No option to take or steal. Took a picture of it instead.
---
No joke, this, the crossbow, and the single action revolvers are pretty insulting in terms of mods available.
---
Me too.
---
Yeah it is I know that I just dont get why it's on the floor and why I cant pick any of it up or why it even says steal and not take
---
So many questions lol
---
I have my AAE Handmade, BE Lever, Uny/Cav and Ass/Sent sets on the account I can’t access. I was in the middle of transferring stuff to my new account when this happened. If I can no longer get on that character I’m probably quitting, I would have wasted hundreds of hours. Hoping things are fixed for all of us tomorrow.
---
God this is so annoying at one violent night.
---
Johnson’s shack down south of Lucky Hole.
---
I rarely see them in PVP, and I do not know all of their stats, but it seems they have superior fire rate verses the automatic rifles. They lack anti-armor, but if the AP costs are around the same, you could just run a critical build and land some unblockable pure damage.
---
I have an extra character slot, I may have to check energy rifles out.
---
Iv lost some interesting items this way too.
---
My city actually has a really great classic hip hop station and it's about all I can listen to.
---
You can definitely see them, and most people seem to treat them as no kill zones, which is kind of awesome.
---
Odd so I assume its stuff from our inventories but I'm pretty sure I didnt have a tech data.... or the holotape....
---
I think a lot of these picture ones are broken atm. 
---
Did all the waterpark ones earlier and all 3 didn't count
---
I found Ansel at Tyler County Fairgrounds. He is on the east side of the fair grounds sitting in one of the chairs behind a green metal building. I checked philipi, wallets, and a couple others but he finally turned up here. I listened to his tape and it started the quest Bucket List. Hope this helps someone..
---
I want more space
---
Thx under looking up worked
---
Y'all launch yet
---
+1. It gets to 1 on the countdown, freezes for 10 seconds and get the Disconnected From Server. Texted with support and nothing they suggested worked.
---
That's still fucking stupid. It's already enough having to deal with lvl 300 decked out melee builds that live in their moms basement now this shit?
---
Johnson's acre? On my way to check it out now.
---
The lawns of the WS is where I got mine. But didn’t have film.
---
Too much HGTV?
---
All the time it's a really Sketchy quests that needs to be worked on.
---
one nice thing about the player stores, people are posting garbage legendaries for cheap, but i have been converting caps to scrip at roughly 4 to 1 by buying them...doesnt seem like a bad exchange rate.
---
no clue..... but ya i was thinking it would be ore
---
Where at?
---
I hope getting a duped weapon from a vendor shop doesn't get me banned.
---
How did the event go? Ir sounds like an interesting  concept
---
Wavy Willard on the server I'm on currently.
---
I don’t use the Gatling gun (yet), but it would be quite the sight (lols) to see a player putting the Gatling gun up to their face to aim down the sights....just sayin. I mean, mounted Gatling gun, sure thing. Slap a sight on and stand behind it. But hip firing one in power armor....which mutation gives you a second pair of eyes in you hips again...?
---
Space is always good [http://e.lvme.me/sjdj7fl.jpg](http://e.lvme.me/sjdj7fl.jpg)
---
I do t thi K it did In the past
---
and you indicated that by typing in those exact words you were able to obtain the answer to my question...which I think may be incorrect
---
I'd rather go the other way. Give me a giant brightly colored wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube man and a bat signal sized spot light to light it up at night.
---
if no guarantees are given - in terms of lvl, at least 1 choice in stat AND a weapon type, you will get a LOT of 10 mm. It's pointless to even have it considering the cap, whey sell random drops to buy random drops. What I would like to see is for 1000 you get to pick your weapon - pistol shotgun rifel, and all 3 stats on it, or at least 2 stats, then for 500 you get to have 2 stats and pick one then for 100 you get to pick just the weapon. A double shot pipe even if explosive and instigating would make those stats pointless.....
---
I use power armor so I’m not interested in backspace at all. I’ll use all my extra time not grinding badges to stock up my vending machines :)
---
Your armor is probably providing some carry weight either with pockets or increasing your strength (unyielding). Both of those benefits go away when you put in power armor. You just get your base strength carry weight plus any perks like radicool and the extra 100 from excavator. You get another 50 per calibrated shock.
---
I’ll check it out. Thank you!
---
On the survival there's a bunch of people using legacy explosives weapons. I just can't figure out how to get non legacy energy weapons be as effective as a aae handmade, or a BE handmade.
---
&gt;akdauel1, sorry for late response, teacher took my phone
---
Dude, pay attention in school.
---
I stuck a wing in my vending machine. Noone buys it. xD
---
Is the rifle for trade?
---
didn't work. those are mongrels not wolves
---
I just bought a TSE dragon from someone for 9999.
---
They were when i went there earlier. My friend suggested it to me.
---
The wendigo cave has a few silver veins in it. At least two or three that I can remember, right in the first big open area you come to where you start seeing mirelurks.
---
I mean. I have like 900 caps and still haven't hit level 50 how the FUCSKT do you have that much
---
Is it wrong that I really want to wander the wasteland in a set of shiny gold power armor now?
---
Man, looking at the chances you get something worthwhile is kinda depressing. Its smart to make the turn in for scrip basically daily, though there is a limit to how much you can have.  I am not too worried about 3 star drops, a good combination of 2 is just fine with me so I will probably go with 2 star rolls. Ill also wait a day to see how others fell how the rolls went. I think, with those numbers, the mystery pick is a little better if aiming for the 3's.
---
I located the box in question and have a pic
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/1EXvHee
---
It bears the Vault Tec logo and says Vault Tec on the other side. I wonder if the holotape leads anywhere.
---
I didnt aim down sights. I find it easier to use the crosshair rather than the iron sights
---
Absolutely nothing but a tinfoil hat
---
People flooded the market. Before you had to be sociable to trade, now you just have to set up a machine and visit other camps, no human interaction needed. Honestly, I’ve been buying up every cheap serum I find and reselling it at 1000c. It’s not a good cap to time ratio selling at 500c or less, especially if you’re putting in the work to make stable flux.
---
Make us able to inspect things in someone's vending machine without them having to be in the build area. Kinda defeats the purpose.
---
How many did you start with?
---
Out of context...
---
I mean, you’re coming to a subreddit dedicated to the game where people are still actively playing it and enjoying their time. 
---
Not to sound supercilious, but yeah.
---
The amount of content they’ve released and active bug fixes, even for a solo player is enough to keep you occupied and give you enough choices do to what you want. Now with player vendors, you get some hotspots of player activity that are generally friendly and inviting as well, besides places like white springs and nuke zones.
---
i had 30 serums in my backlog, was selling 2-4 per day to vendors. ran out quickly when players could buy them
---
Kill him quick. My main was a few shots, but my bloodied alt is one. Make sure you do all the damage while close, he goes into this funny dying animation. That's when you loot him. Take too long and you get goo.
---
Hell, Steam takes on average takes 30% of any game sale, and yet everybody just smiles and goes "Steam deserves the cut," and makes arguments why Steam needs 30% of the dev's take. Meanwhile, a game takes 10% of a non-existent currency and people lose their shit.
---
Hey don't knock Troubleshooters, having a good one on hand/stashed for Silos and Encryptid Events is totally worthwhile 👍
---
I might have to swing back by it if I server hop. going to try WS next. I had never been to that spot before though. was a fun fight with all the super mutants and gulpers.
---
You can add me. PSN is fakenunchucks. I'm Aussie so not sure if our play times will be in sync though.
---
Damage resistance for some PVP fun
---
&gt;How is buying a 500-1000 caps weapon for 5000 caps a nice find with bad legendary effects like that?
---
In what fucking fantasy land is an explosive +dr dragon a 100 cap weapon? I just bought a 2 star TSE dragon for 10k, and would have happily paid 10k for this. Caps are stupid easy to get, guns like this are rare as fuck.
---
That brahmin didn't do anything to you.
---
Can't say I'm glad to not be alone in this. Fur Straightening.
---
I already run Good With Salt, so unless the refrigeration unit is almost as good I think I'll stick with either Lead Lined or Armor Plating. The extra space mod actually reduces armor rating, so I'll take a hard pass on that one. I'm good enough at managing my inventory without it.
---
It's 2019. Do your keyboards not have commas yet?
---
I just need to get one. Just got into pc gaming again last year. At least on pc it would be a great for communication, consoles suck for text chat.
---
All about earning the badges look at your world challenges
---
chat doesnt work for me at all.. never has..
---
gimmie 75 characters and id be stoked...
---
&gt;I wish it would let you inspect weapons though. A guy next to me had an instigating black powder rifle that I really wanted but it was a two star and I couldn’t tell what the second star was.
---
There's a bug that only keys you inspect items if the camp owner is nearby. I'm sure they'll fix it eventually, but in the meantime I've had good luck sending people a message to come home if I find something potentially interesting.
---
We already have a mutation that boosts reload speed and we definitely don't need another mutation that boosts melee damage, as it is high as it can be atm
---
What platform are you on?
---
I CAN BE WHATEVER I WANT TO BE. I AM A MR. GUTSY
---
"I just started going beep beep beep."
---
Ahhh....the sound of 10 rocket turrets going of at once...sounds like victory
---
Unless that Deathclaw is into it...
---
Forreal. It wasn't like that in the beta I'm fairly certain.
---
The only way this would work is if they choose a location on the map to make a bazzar with defined plots you can build in so if the plot is full on that server you can just move go the next open spot and drop your camp.
---
I ran into the sheepsquatch 5 hours ago. Legendary toxic, I fought him for 5 minutes while hiding and sniping. Eventually he figured out I was hiding behind a tree then a scorch beast came. Luckily, some guy in power armor showed up and bailed me out. I kept him trying to engage me while  it chased me around a tree and the other guy shot at it. Took almost 20 minutes and a couple of hundred rounds of ammo.
---
Anyone else notice that the Dev interacting with her in the screenshot has a Legendary Bone Hammer and Legendary Scout Armor? Good to know that Bethesda could have totally out them in the loot tables (and *have* for their in-house version) but didn't bother letting us get them. Where my Legendary Chainsaws at Beth!? 🤣
---
That's been going on patch before last for me i think.
---
Dark wood is better. less glare
---
Im not sure it can work and if it did then we would all be fighting over prime real estate.  then complaining that they have to server hop 20 times before they get their plot.  I don't see it
---
You still in there?
---
To clarify about the server hoping, I do that before I pick up the daily as the items are already existing items used for quest. They should fix that quest issue.
---
Palace of the Winding Path. Upon spawning there you want to take a left through the entrance after passing the bus. Along the cliffs there's a target practice area with a a crossbow sitting on a table.
---
no it's gonna be complete RNG
---
&gt;Ppl would for sure murder each other cause you would be dropping all that stable flux you just got
---
Raw flux is in aid, so you only drop a little. Also, when the event starts people focus on the queen rather than gathering food, so you wouldn't get much anyway.
---
If you fast travel to huntersville, turn around and a little further down the road on the left hand side (heading away from huntersville) is a brotherhood of steel grave site, there's usually wolves that spawn there.
---
"Someone ought to, not me though." My dude, feelings aint facts. If I've said something incorrect or incomprehensible please engage in a dialogue. If you disagree with my sentiments, best to attack my sentiments not the person (as I've given you no ammunition to do so). Cheers.
---
I really don't like this.
---
I'm ok with a scrip cap. I'm ok with a daily scrip acquisition cap. But have both just really sucks. 
---
Thanks dupers.
---
Extra armour
---
PC and ps4
---
Code is 32560743
---
For a quite while every single time I FTd anywhere there was a Technical Data wherever I landed. It really sucked when I was working on my camp, because I wasn't able to build anything where it was.
---
Are they drowning or getting hit by something big like a behemoth or w/e? Because some deaths are auto-kills with no "bleedout" time, so you can't revive.
---
Instead, try having them stand in shallow water like a river or small pond, and commit suicide by shooting the ground with an explosive weapon. Odds are the dmg will put them in bleedout instead of auto-dying, and then you'll be able to revive them.
---
Don't forget the 10% tax. 2500 of that 25,000 is gone no matter what.
---
Nope. 3 wins. No plans, nor badges yet.
---
I would buy the fuck out of a 3star sneak wood armor
---
It happened before. It's markers for player spawn points which got visible
---
My Hardened raiders chest piece is definitely now showing over my Engineer’s uniform. It’s unfortunate.
---
I have a plan for an Ivory grip priced at 17676, mostly a joke/meme thing as to how often it can be found, lol.
---
PvP is deactivated if you're in an event area. One it ends its game on, but no one is trying to kill each other during the fight.
---
I've got the high capacity mod already. Totally worth the extra 60 carry weight and the loss of 60 energy and rad resist imo.
---
Firefly, Bloodbug, Stingwing so far.
---
How many of the quests you have to do to get the backpack?
---
I just got my picture done at Free Range.
---
going to try this now.
---
Ya, Tanaas is right, it's gonna be a full on Slot Machine 🤦
---
Keep in mind though that everyone else will spawn where you originally placed your camp module. That's where you want your entrance to be.
---
What's the problem??
---
on PC I can do Recon Sensors for other PA helmets. If you need one and are on PC look me up. IGN: jchamlin
---
Keyboards work fine on XBO for text. Not much of a difference.
---
I've now done this event 5 times and don't have a single badge, I guess I'm not getting any mods because this is just ridiculous.
---
Praise Atom! You speak the truth!
---
Dang. I'm on Xbox.
---
Still in there! Defending the red robot guys. I’m guessing I’ll be launching soon? Lol
---
Holy fuck. Survival is a PVP mode. People will sit outside your base.
---
I'm not sure what your complaint is. If you're worried about getting ganked at your camp in survival you can turn off the machines and disappear. If you want to sell shit safely you can load into adventure.
---
What's the problem?
---
Got them! Thanks so much
---
Like you mentioned, it's not your standard fallout experience. 
---
But, if you go in open-minded and see the livelihood that the most recent patch has brought to the game, it can be a really fun and creative experience. 
---
Take the time to deck out your camp in a spot you enjoy, and the game starts to feel pretty comfy. 
---
Also, if you're on PS4, i'd gladly help get you back up to speed.
---
What has changed:
---
So many bug fixes and QoL updates
---
Player vending is sweet
---
Multiple questlines, dealing with a new faction, new cryptid
---
May 16th, new vendor that lets you trade your unwanted legendaries for new ones, not a 1to1 trade, but a pretty fair exchange rate
---
Moddable backpacks that add carry weight + different effects 
---
Etc.
---
The gameplay core is still the same, but it's been greatly improved on since launch.
---
What do you mean turn them off? How? It's still a pain in the ass to do.
---
It reduces rad resist *and* energy? Didn't know about the rad drop, thanks for the tip 👍
---
It's always something with Bethesda. Like the legendary vender not selling mods or specific weapons. Instead its left up to chance.
---
You triggered a suicide bot lmao
---
Fuck ya I love survival ch ival jus for that I dont I tend on chillin at my camp too often and if someone is patient enough to wait for me to come back then I guess I deserve it lol.
---
Update: Haven’t gotten a badge since the hotfix today after doing the event 10 times.
---
Thank you, and thanks for the items in the bag.
---
Also...
---
(not sure if we can give karma for this, but I'll try.)
---
Its all good. I've spend far too many hours trying to find this fella. Figured others shouldn't have to suffer the same
---
I don’t think it works anymore, Bethesda had Deathclaws incorrectly labeled as animals so they could be tamed but in the patch notes I vaguely remembering seeing they were relabeled
---
That's my favorite!
---
If that's the case, I'd be more than happy to shell out 25k caps for another Action Hero, double my minimum 10k .50 cal rounds, and just MELT what even stands before me. Prime them both and lvl 80 scotch beast wouldn't last 100 rounds. 
---
One more red blood cell and my dick will explode off my body in excitement. I know what I'll be thinking about before bed tonight! 😏
---
No problem. I guess it would depend on what you're going for with your character, but on mine at least, it's not really that big a deal. Since I'm all about sniping and killing in as few hits as possible while trying to avoid being hit at all. :P
---
Dumbest question you could ask really. Why not read some and make you own opinion
---
Infront of overseers camp there is a bridge. Jump on the bridge run and jump to the edge of the river where u can still see the floor very clear but there's still water. Right there is the perfect spot
---
I think a lot of people are just selling their crap ( not everyone ).
---
I saw a couple of 3 star armor items but could not inspect so didn't go any further.
---
Ahhh that would make sense. Thanks for that
---
Well, I bought one for 2000 caps a week ago from a random player. 2* tse handmade 45 lvl. Couldn’t believe my luck.
---
slip187o.  friend me.
---
Put a switch on the wall, connect the vending machine to a switch, and then connect the switch to the rest of your power system. When the machine is powered you show up on the map, flip the switch and you disappear.
---
Oh ya I'm probably gonna go for capacity anyways 🤣 but I really like knowing exactly what I'm getting into when I've had to grind a ton to get it
---
The whole "I identify as (random object)" has never been a funny joke, change my mind
---
Huh? I use a power pylon?
---
yea i remember seeing them removing the ability to pacify them with animal friend but now they can be pacified with wasteland whisperer
---
Seen a ton of ungrabble items on the ground like that over the months. Old glitch, don't worry about it bud.
---
Launched it!! Whoop! Let’s kill this bitch
---
Damn. And I needed some fresh salt, too.
---
Super helpful if you're trying to surprise people too.
---
Whenever someone used to visit my camp, I'd start playing a banjo against a wall, surrounded by bone chimes. They'd come in, make sure not to touch any chimes, and stay out of what would normally be my line of sight... Just as they got comfortable, I'd hit them with a Pennywise "Hiya Georgie!"
---
Oh very cool, I wasn’t aware of wasteland whisperer
---
What were you selling them for?
---
That's close to what I'm doing. Valuable stuff like springs and adhesive that have a list price of 80+ get listed for 50 caps, everything else goes for half of list price.
---
There's no way to sell anything to the vendors as far as I'm aware. The only current way to earn badges is through the world challenges, doing the repeatable quests, and the nighttime event at camp adams.
---
The only one I regret having is Speed Demon. The faster run speed is nice, but it feels like I can't go more than 10 seconds without needing to eat or drink.
---
No, just a grownup with a limited time. See, an average gamer is very slowly getting older. Meaning we just cannot tolerate the kind of shit we would have shrugged off in the '90s or even '00s. It's 2019. Basing a game this heavily on RNG is just not a good idea. And it's been proven, repeatedly, not to be a good idea. Not one game was ruined by bringing RNG under control. In fact, it was the exact opposite. Elder Scrolls Online made a study on this, literally. They started really small, and then basically gave the players almost complete control. And the game didn't collapse, nobody died, there wasn't a mass exodus.
---
Why do people keep asking this? It's like some bot putting it up all the time ( no offense to OP ).
---
I was fine at 400, y'all filthy hoarders need to"lighten up" 🤣🤣🤣
---
And 90 reduced weight
---
I just don't understand why a bloodied shotgun would be better than a bloodied explosive shotgun.
---
My bad. I haven't had an xbox for a minute
---
I do play the game, but when I'm not playing it I want to make a profit.
---
Did you get the mod?
---
I did. Thanks for the offer though.
---
I've been doing this currently. I'm usually idle in my camp bedroom spinning around on the bed.
---
I heard this has been fucked up forever. Same thing happened to me. Lvl2 doesn’t work at all and 3 is sketchy at best. Lvl 1 is the only one that seems to work the right way.
---
Just become a junkie
---
well im no expert but I'd love to help, if you want add me on xbox: renawana
---
No, there's a "switch" in the power connector tab that looks like a little green box with a light switch on it. I think you need the "advanced power connector" plans to unlock them, but that's only 200 caps or so from the Enclave production vendor.
---
Hook your machine up to the switch and connect the switch to the "grid" and your good to go.
---
it’s wayyyyyy at the end of the charisma perks. works like animal friend for the creatures that aren’t humanoid but aren’t flagged as animals
---
deathclaws, snallygasters, the like
---
Its works for me, but it happens so rarely that I've been thinking about dropping it for another perk once I get around to deciding which one.
---
I'll try there. Maybe it'll work.
---
There's no disadvantages that I know of, so it just really depends on what you'd prefer to have. Extra carry weight or better damage resistance. The standard lvl 50 pack already gives you a shit ton of extra carry weight though.  I'm at almost 400 lbs. My armor is super tough too (also almost 400 DR) so I'm in sorta the same predicament.  Lol. Decisions, decisions...
---
Had this issue earlier, but I use pistols. 95% hit chance and I went through let 10+ rounds with no hits.
---
i honestly just bought them. it’s a cap grind for sure but with the hard bargain perk and 3 industrial water purifiers, it was short work
---
free states vendor sells em
---
theres a mod that adds in text chat
---
Stick the fridge on it then :p
---
Bruh i spend 1300 caps on a single beer one time cuz can
---
I'd like to learn the plan. I'll add you and look for you. IGN: jchamlin
---
Most likely what I'm going with
---
Any good ways to grind caps?, I used to sell mothman egg omelettes but I heard that was nerfed
---
Odd flex but ok
---
It was not worth it. Immediate regret.
---
I was stunned when I saw the new airport. So cool. God I was stoked. 
---
But ya. Poor bot was dead for me too. Think he’s just that way now.
---
Definitely will lol
---
Honestly,  I just want a damn Mr. Fuzzy skin! Lol
---
Nah sounds worth imo
---
This is ultimate RP, nothing can top it.
---
In the last 3 days I've gone from 18k to 3k to 13k and now back to 3k because I just bought a TSE dragon. This update is fucking awesome.
---
PSA: I'll buy every nuke card I find if it's priced at 200 or less.
---
I think after reading the weekly blog from this week Bethesda plans to rework some current content and add more content in the next couple of weeks that will add to this list
---
Are you talking about the woodland camo skins that you can get in the Atomic Shop? Once you buy it there, it is usable on all models I believe. I say this because I had a full set of T-45 with woodland camo but just upgraded to T-51b and there was already an option for me to paint my new T-51b with the woodland camo pattern.
---
YES! I can't tell you how many times I come home to my door is wide open..
---
That sounds awesome
---
Just got the set at the whitespring train station, had 1200 caps and said fuck it
---
Pretty sure the guy pissed in the bottle then ripped me off.
---
oh i tried to imply that in my comment but i guess i didn’t. my bad
---
i sold purified water! industrial sized water purifiers can hold a max of 5 waters each, and with the hard bargain perk, your sell prices for items are better. brought the water up to like 10 caps per, if i remember right. 
---
also i raided medical places (hospitals, clinics, test labs, etc) for chems and sold those too cause i don’t use em. my favorite places to hit were the clinic in harpers ferry, morgantown airport, and arktos pharma
---
good luck!
---
That is true but you can't always get the events flatwoods is a good answer for the radroaches
---
No I’m talking about the military paint that’s just all army green. It was made available for X-01 with patch 9 so I’m assuming it’s available for all the others except ultracite, excavator and raider. But I don’t know where to get it but I don’t think anyone knows yet.
---
Just  feel it out. I saw someone sold salt for 25k earlier lol
---
Can confirm, my Mr. Fuzzy is my fave outfit to wear
---
Always a concern when scrapping armor though that I’ll break it :/
---
10/10 would spend many atoms for that
---
Even with 3 items, and even being able to choose a weapon type, the odds are still beyond insane.
---
I'm shooting from the hip here, and it's almost midnight, so don't kill me if I fudge it. And numbers aren't exact. But suppose I want a gun, ANY gun, and a 3-star, with specific setup, your odds are around 1 in 1,500. Considering you may be capped at 150 scrips a day, that's 1.5 items every day, so ~1,000 days? That is for ONE item slot (weapon). Do the same for all slots. And while you'll have other legendary sources, and you may be able to recycle crap that Purveyor will inevitably give you, it will still be a crazy number.
---
Ty for your service
---
Sounds good thanks man
---
I need the same achievement I'll help you if you help me
---
Was just going to make a post about this
---
Really good idea thanks!
---
As a long time AC player and fan, this makes me so incredibly happy and made my freakin week
---
100%
---
i was more so wondering if there was a way we could link our game with steam like other games do
---
I’m on next week so I’ll see you then
---
i honestly dont know why its coming to steam
---
Damn even better
---
Groovy I’m down for it, want this thing over with lol.
---
What’s your GT?
---
the backpack is 120 weight, but -60 energy and radiation resistance
---
They're pretty nice. I'd still play without it, and it won't keep one from going to the SBQ with their crafting set activated lulz
---
What in the world did you do to your post?
---
Np, now to earn those 3 badges back again :)
---
Dayum, lol. Guess I'm not doing terrible then. I put up a bunch of junk at (mostly) their vending/sell prices.
---
Sometimes I put them to try and target low level characters (though add a few mods too) but lower the price by a bit.
---
Good luck out there!
---
No. Bc I’m doing it now and haven’t completed the tadpole badges yet
---
Mmm....yes....I want that gauntlet.
---
What level are you? 1200 caps really isn't that much. I just sell everything, enemy weapons, junk, if a train station is nearby, being encumbered isn't a big deal and with the shared pool it's really easy to make a bunch of caps.
---
Likewise! I’m grinding the campfire event. Hopefully they drop pretty quick.
---
How do you know when a sale is made? Does it tell you with a message?
---
I always go a little way under its recommended price. Cause im just happy being able to get rid of it
---
Lvl 57 but am a hoarder and afraid to let go of anything “Incase I need it later”
---
I got 4 yesterday doin the event!
---
Please tell me about all the free communist governments that exist.
---
Drowning is instant death
---
Cool. I think I want to get the lead lined mod and armor plate mods, so I’m going to need a few.
---
If you're talking about the Impostor Sheepsqatch I still strike it often.
---
I think it's good - though over very quick. I think the Free Range event ( the other Sheepsquatch ) is lame as hell.
---
Reminds me of the Helvetia one that we all did a million times.
---
Some of y'all have been one shotting things for the life of the game and it shows. 
---
If you can kill everything but legendaries in at most 3-4 hits, you're OP in my book.
---
of course!! go get you some fancy house plans 😎
---
Try the player vendors, I think I saw a brick building set at a low price once at one of them but not too sure.
---
I haven’t picked any up yet but I think I’m going for the armor first since I don’t need the weight that bad. I really just want more skins. I need all the skins
---
First NPC. I hope she has a introduction like boaderlands does lol
---
Been trying that but everything is either over priced or they have plans I already have
---
You still need help? I need to do those too
---
Say, that's an interesting vase.
---
Not sure what Jetpack catapult is and I haven’t managed to drop shit on someone’s bed ^^yet
---
Rest of the list is covered, lol
---
Guess you add “gain all scout badges” that’s ass... lol
---
Nope. I'm just glad people aren't breaking everything for scrip. It may be a 1* but I replaced my assassins gauss for a 2 shot. 
---
I'm sure nobody wanted my troubleshooter pickaxe but my nocturnal wood left arm is going for 25 caps.
---
Yeah I get that too. I don’t know I guess I’m just jaded about it lol. I try to put low level legendaries in mine when I happen upon one. But yes good point thank you.
---
You can easily sell stuff to vendors and make 1400 caps per day. That’s not counting doing any missions or player vending machines. You should be making 1400 caps per day minimum even if you can only play for an hour.
---
I have gotten 2 perfectly preserved pie in fallout 76. I try a lot lol
---
It's sounds similar with the "doncha knows", but I'm not sure it's the same person. Either way, I love the personality they've built into all the new bots.
---
yes it's always iffy if its gonna work or not
---
Yo wtf dood it’s 2019 we can identify as whatever we want just like me I identify as a toaster
---
Can I  get in on this? I need the same thing and snugly be online soon.
---
Yea I’ll buy that Taco Bell maaaaay have ran out..
---
Collect a l l the hats
---
Sure just send me your GT won’t be on for long tho
---
Well damn, hopefully you find what you're looking for. What platform are you on?
---
You and me both. Aaaand I sank about 150 caps hopping around the map looking for some serums in vain.
---
I play on Xbox, and the community is so far unexpectedly not toxic
---
I really kind of like the look of the possum pack. The tadpole is almost the same, just a little lighter color.
---
Here’s me with the possum:
---
https://i.imgur.com/tC0EjRC.jpg
---
https://i.imgur.com/IXIoCde.jpg
---
I know a spot where they spawn out in the open.  Was the first item I sold through my vending machine. 50 caps.
---
Someone left my door open and a super mutant walked in and destroyed nearly my whole house while I was running errands
---
I'll tell you this: I'm over level 200, you really don't need any of your scrap above 50, except steel, acid, adhesive,screws, springs. It is really easy to farm supplies when low. I keep everything around 25.
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
Yea there a bit annoying but we love them (mainly because get that sweet ultracite plans from there queen)
---
Buff the cross bow to
---
Ah, if you'd been on the PS I could have hit you up if I ran into some of those plans myself.
---
Thanks for thinking about it tho!
---
I fell in that same pit tonight. Luckily I can out heal his floor spikes.
---
Hell yes. 
---
I'd even go as far as to say even a way to respec SPECIAL.
---
Thanks this helps a lot!
---
Think of how Eso does it. Refunds all your points and keeps your skills at the level they were at. We need that on this game.
---
Maybe learn all plans and recipes, although finding a comprehensive updated list could be an issue.
---
Should I also keep Ultracite too?
---
so what doesnt makes sense? all youve done is argue my points, but you have yet to provide an alternative to what im saying.  if you think im wrong, great, explain why instead of acting like an angsty condescending teen.
---
Thats no fun lol. You could of sold it for more probably
---
I have a full set of Troubleshooter's gear, and me and a bud solo this event pretty regularly. He takes two conduits, I take one, and I tank the Sheepsquatch. Long story short, you don't have to die as a high level if you do it properly. That said, you will get absolutely melted and use 50+ Stimpaks if you try it at a low level.
---
Great. Just did wrapons art on them and it's set to 3. Bloodied mess and adrenaline don't do shit into them. I'm getting 3/10 on flaming duel bar
---
Do you mean the Emclave bunker?
---
Kill both
---
Now I just visit these posts to see which side of the bipolar bed Reddit got out of this time.
---
No, I mean the golf club house at whitesprings, the main building that people like to farm. Where people would place turret camps
---
not a cap grind at all. 
---
1. go to billings homestead left side of map near the nuka cola factory - pick the corn then all the razor grain thats 500 ish caps right there. (with green thumb perk) 
---
2. go to all the railroad stations hunt the nearest mobs sell the weapons and armor. also you dont need more than 100 of any junk.  inventory junk with a price tag can be sold directly to the vendor without bulking (gold silver radioctive mat etc.) 
---
3. the brick plans can be bought at harpers ferry. ALSO if you're strong enough to hunt there selling mob weapons and armor there can get you a lot of caps as well. 
---
hitting the daily sell cap is easy once you know your way around and you have some decent combat ability. 
---
oh and food. I sell all food thats not corn soup. corn soup is easy to cook gives ap regen and hydrates and feeds you. all other foods i sell at the vendor. 
---
stimpacks. diluted stimpacks are nice at lower levels. with chemist perk and the recipe for stim packs you can get tick blood just south of the vault 76 at the moonshiner shack. and then down at the lumber yard. the blood sacks and blood are used to make stim packs, with a water purifier you can make stims dilute them and sell for big profits for very little risk. 
---
make things to sell with excess junk. you dont need 1500 wood and 200 steel. make hatchets. get xp. sell em, get caps. 
---
IF you are still leveling and are under level 50 dont worry about keeping a lot of junk keep only enough to repair your weapon since all the armor will be replaced in 5 levels. sell it sell it all.
---
No current fix for "Nothing is Selected" except exiting the build menu and opening it back up. Fortunately, if you don't change where you're looking the item you were trying to place will usually be exactly where you had it when the menu closed. Still super annoying though.
---
The day the vending machine came out, I was at like 17000 caps. I bought so much stuff that I'm down to like 6,000. And it goes up and down because people buy that stuff for my machine, then I turn around and go buy more stuff.
---
Gotcha, I’ve seen some people call the Bunker the Enclaves “Clubhouse”
---
billings homestead will net 500 - other than that I just hit up mobs and sell the weps and armors. takes about 30 minutes to cap out when I start my play session.
---
I have a bunch of junk, I’m on PS4, add me: CaptainModrah
---
Reassuring to know I'm not the only one, I'll give it a day and try again after work tomorrow. Just really wanted to get my hands on some X01 power armor to use my new nuka paint on it lol
---
The grey'd out? I dunno. Did it on my phone.
---
I sort of like it because all the mobs spawning at people's camps gave me about a dozen legendary items so far. One of them was even a 3 star bloodrage mirelurk at the pond in WS.
---
Reason for this is it doesn’t know it’s there until it logs you into it
---
And we walked to Morgantown Elementary for plastic uphill both ways...
---
Looollllll, i did that too
---
Ahh I forgot about the roads.
---
I could use that mole rat's exterminator's gatling laser. R/fallout's roaches are creeping out the wood work. Bad pun not intended.
---
So, what's north? Immediately, Grafton Dam and Steel.  Then the scout camp before the northernmost points on the map.
---
Its yellow and blue on xbox fwiw.
---
Same
---
Yeah it happened to me and my friend too
---
I've been leaving it in front of vender machines with ridiculously high prices.
---
I’m just sad I don’t have that beautiful weapon of death
---
I 1 shot every super mutant out there with my instigating crossbow. And I didn't even choose my prime instigating crossbow
---
You keep deleting your comments before I can respond but here's a response to you asking for an alternative reason, instead of "being an angsty teen"
---
Because Bethesda has never, nor ever claimed they have and were ever going to, add weapon mods to the atomic shop. 
---
Your example of weapon skins being in the atomic shop doesn't apply in any way, as you can't even find weapon skins within the game world as far as I know. However mods, you can find in the world and serve an entirely different purpose. 
---
To say there are no mods now for it being an indicator that it would be an atomic shop item as well makes no sense, I assume if Bethesda can add entirely new weapons to the game, they could add a mod menu for an already existing weapon.
---
Sure, what the hell. PSN: Lightningmk1 
---
Meet my a deathclaw island and I’ll let it gore me. And yes it does count for the kindness
---
You need it to repair Ultracite-based items or restock Ultracite ammo for weapons using Prime receivers. keep it at 50, sell the rest.
---
Awesome thanks adding now
---
Same here. I dont think I've even been selling my legendaries for more than 500 or something? (Based on other's Legendary prices)
---
If it’s still open once work finishes in NZ I’ll try and drop by
---
Get flung on the flingy trap thing and turn on jetpack, physics engine, being Bethesda, promptly melts and blasts you to the Stratosphere
---
I have a second vending machine for selling outfits
---
you already own it and you might as well try. read the patchnotes to see what all has changed. judging by your core complaints I don't think you will like it but maybe on the second attempt something will spark your interest. I am at 800 hours and love it. but fallout is an odd universe with odd fans.
---
No... not this time, with 1000 I will finally not use it all... I swear!
---
Sure sounds like the same person who did Rose to me
---
LOL same then I end up chatting.
---
Who took more chems she or you in a fight that is a bit hard?
---
Whitespring shops, lots of hangers for some quick scrap.
---
That and the harmonica too. =)

Check this out

Oh making Fixers! That's a good idea! I've been stocking stuff I can make too, like apparels and camera film and they've been moving pretty well, but I hadn't even thought of making Fixers! I should try Sheepsquatch Clubs too.
---
Thinking about maybe moving my Camp right next to the Pioneer Scout Camp and selling Crossbows too 🤔
---
Tried making spare cameras to sell cheap for people who couldn't find the Tourist, but after repairing and adding lenses to 7 spare cameras I discovered they're non-transferable and I'd just wasted a big pile of materials 🤦
---
Join on my world, I’m at the island now
---
Okay then! Thanks for letting us know.
---
This right here  
---
I am fine with all other perks, but these two are frustratingly annoying
---
You’re the hero this wasteland needs
---
But numbers are fun! Do you know what is funnier then 24? 25!!!!!
---
I saw a screenshot someone took earlier of a vendor that was a bunch of the same Legendary weapons.
---
Yeah. I have no good legendarys. Probally will exchange them lol
---
Well he says go north to Vault 76. I'm pretty sure now thinking about it it's in the Flatwoods area. It has a town, river, and a fork, directly north is Vault 76, and it's a short hike from morgantown, just as he describes
---
Anyone else wonder why the 10mm SMG has wires sticking out of it? And do you guys think the design is better in 3 or 76?
---
Either of you about to help me with it?
---
Nothing like getting the brakes beaten off your ass to help the community. Ever Upwards
---
Misread that as Mama Murphy's Meth Pick, if only there was a legendary with that name that gave you a slight damage bonus when under the influence of chems.
---
For me it's the opposite. I got a mod today and haven't got one in a very long time
---
I hear you...but I'm afraid somewhere down that Pioneer storyline will be something I need or want. So better to travel that road a bit now.
---
Lol I’ll just sell u the plan for cheap
---
It's her grand mum
---
Because now everybody is visiting everyone else's Camps, and OP just realized a lotta people built much nicer Camps than they did 🤣
---
The Vending Machines have changed the game Rickey, it's a whole new world now that Camps can be marked on the map and fast travelled too. Appalachia feels a lot less lonely now.
---
I’ve been cleaning it up and stock piling so I can make mini nukes on their bases😂 #QuitScamming
---
I would also recommend killing a lot of super mutant it gives good xp
---
Exact same situation here, lol. I was a bit disappointed.
---
Thanks. I could see myself doing that too.
---
Yep, I hadn't seen it until I posted.
---
It doesn't provide bonuses in Power Armor.
---
r/assassinscreed
---
It's 10% of an in game currency, why don't you go wave your anarcho capitilist flag in the woods if you're so against the concept of tax.
---
It's fuck all and acts as a another way of chipping away at player caps. Given people are creating alts to horde up to 75k or more caps across thier accounts it sounds like it's needed. 
---
Utter wierdo.
---
Did you ever find it though? Also it's been buffed, so I'm currently trying to find it.
---
Then half the player base would be banned during the first batch of duping...
---
Are you the guy that stole all my crops????
---
Some people do how they do
---
If only information like that was written down somewhere after releasing a patch. You could call it “notes about the most recent patch we just released”. There might be a shorter way to say it. Idk 😐
---
That's basically what happened. Spam scrappining weapons, specifically, from the weapons category, and the outfits are bye bye. I hate that this happened to you, but I'm glad there are others so that Bethesda doesn't ignore it and assume I'm just an idiot. I would very much love my outfits back.
---
I rolepay as myself and I think I do a pretty good job of being al 'round unlikable
---
Looks like back to Flatwoods we go.
---
I was curious if they’d changed the intelligence modifier perhaps, mine is at 5...u?
---
Yes, i thought that was clear. A small amount of scrip and that way i can progress my scrip and still participate in trading  my new legendaries.
---
do you even read any of the stuff they put on the start screen or you just hit start
---
No, I'll be keeping it at least for now. I'm on PS4, so you might not be able to get it anyway.
---
What? That doesnt happen in regular mode...
---
Amazing!
---
Definitely, maybe in the little icon that shows the vault boy taps a microphone and your character gestures towards their mouth?
---
The best I can do is a possum at the motel that I look for lead at is now labeled as a mole rat.
---
And how are you hostile. You are all skipping a step. Since the last patch this isnt even possible as far as I'm aware.
---
That brick set is *pricey*, at least to me as a level 23.
---
Yeah I’m actually interest in the stash upgrade. Even if it doesn’t work in PA if all o have to do is get out and there is a stash box on my back that would be nice idk how that upgrade works yet I haven’t seen any one get it yet
---
You cant even do it in none survival. I dont think these people still play the game or read the patch notes... if that were true anyone could tp for 20caps to your base and destroy you. Damn trolls.
---
Repeatable dailies give badges?
---
That should be self explanatory.
---
Mine is alot higher not sure exactly. Maybe that has something to do with it
---
Playing since B.E.T.A. and had no idea! Thanks!!
---
glad i'm not alone
---
I was at a CAMP and there was a radrat that got inside and was destroying things. I know somebody just ignored it because I walked past them.
---
Got a little blood on the floor but I mean the guy opened his house to me I couldn't let a radrat destroy everything....
---
PC user here, quest is broken for me as well.
---
What a cheapskate
---
Randomly in the Forrest region.
---
Only for those that have the mod aswell unfortunately
---
This is not a realistic expectation. Have accepted over 40 players so far and not 1 negative thing has happened. Not 1
---
You sure about that🤔
---
I feel like alot has changed this patch. Things feel very different
---
There is a skeleton with a basket full of them at the base of the monorail elevator
---
This. Also for the people who still lock their doors as if they got anything worth hiding lol.
---
same 20 hour reset, yup.
---
Lol dont think so. Have invited over 40 people to my base and not a single bad thing has happened. Not 1.
---
Just turned my build into a vats commando, and my non-legendary 10-Sub can do work. But getting mobbed by everything in a 200m radius for firing it is... annoying. So yes please, suppressor and sights. 
---
45 SMG and several other guns could use some love too. Mainly just in scaling up their damage so that I don't have to default to my handmade rifle all the time. Upped energy weapons (higher than that original buff) would be really nice too. Any weapon that can't benefit from sneak perks needs to be buffed. 
---
Just so we're clear, we're all aware of the small buffs energy weapons have already gotten since launch. I'm not asking for them to be OP, just on par with handmades with sneak buffs. Hell, what about a "stealth laser" that shoots infrared and benefits from sneak perks?  (Real life laser weapons, used to disable IED's and missiles, are infrared)
---
Accomplice positions near the target, you team the target and shoot your accomplice
---
I just wish criticals worked the same way on the railway rifle in this game like they do in Fallout 4.
---
I got a mic for 76 and never used one before. I'd rather have a text option.
---
Around the donut place above overseers camp
---
Just west of the teapot there's a few that spawn
---
Well there must be more than one camo paint scheme then. I haven't seen an OD green scheme you can acquire out in the game. Only the version I'm seeing on other reddit posts, which is the woodland camo that you buy in the Atomic Shop.
---
Now I'll pay more attention to the stuff i carry....
---
ooooo look at all those office fans over there....
---
Would be a drag if they changed something like this and didn’t tell us, I’m very close to unlocking all the armor mods and don’t want to blow points to respec
---
I can play next week, can we take her down when I’m on?
---
PSN: CaptainModrah
---
Which are you missing
---
The trick they do is to have a friend with them that they’re not teamed up with. They attack each other and become hostile to one another. Then one adds you to their team but they both travel to your CAMP. 
---
Because you’re now teamed up with someone who is in active PvP, so are you, making your CAMP vulnerable. 
---
CAMPs aren’t non-destructible, they’re only protected if you’re not in active PvP with the attacker. 
---
It’s somewhat complicated and it’s really the very definition of griefing—but they’re definitely doing it. Your intentions with this seem pure, but it’s unfortunately the reality at the moment.
---
Add me I’m free next week
---
If you go to the MODUS production terminal he sells all the plans for X-01 mods and has the X-01 Military Paint plan for about 250c. Check it out and you’ll see what I mean.
---
You doing this next week? 
---
My PSN is CaptainModrah
---
Buttressed Raider Legs, a Few enameled Mods on robot and metal, maybe 10 or so of the lesser secondary mods scattered among non CB and Leather
---
So the sheepquach poison attacks doesn’t dot you to death?
---
This question isn’t an answer to yours, but was this quest adde in the pioneer scouts update, because I’ve never gotten it before it
---
It didn't exist back then, no idea if it doesn't now as I haven't touched the game in the last 4 months or so.
---
There's a really cool place in the Mire to the far right. You may have seen it but could make a great shop. I personally don't use it because I love being near Whitespring
---
Yea that worked I should have known, hard reset literally fixes every problem lol
---
Yes!
---
I could have sworn they said it would work in power armour as well
---
just SW of Gorge Junk yard there are about 8-9 spawn points near the 64 on the map on both sides of the highway. you’ll see a little “loop” area made from the river and the highway... that area in there and across the highway. lots of Starlight berries as well!
---
You should post this on a trading sub reddit
---
Yep, and their Brahmin too ;)
---
I think so, because I got it for the first time yesterday. Then I didn't do it because I was doing other stuff. Today I got it again and figured I'd see what it was about.
---
No mic but I know the deal.   Where you want to do it?
---
Didn’t even know about that, thanks dweller69
---
Thanks this helps, the only one I got right was herpetology since I took a class on them.
---
I have to try this!
---
The bloatfly one has good damage.
---
Why you gotta be such a dick about it?
---
Please do this.   I have a mic,  but I play with my wife and want to be able to speak freely without having to worry about talking in area, or switching to area to communicate or any of the tens of other reasons that practically every other online game has text chat.
---
Throw your unwanted legenderies in it .
---
No I’m being serious I had no idea. And you didn’t like dweller69?
---
They have a cool down of once per hour, and that cooldown is universal so if someone else milks it you can't.  
---
Best way to get that badge place one in your camp, and do not put a trading vendor there.
---
I'm a grown man. I'm still waiting for that baby-mothman backpack \^\_\^
---
They seem kind of buggy. I went to my camp, built a fertilizer pen, milked, destroyed, rebuilt, rinse repeated until done.
---
So much time wasted do to that, yeah. the tears must be felt.
---
I don’t know if a good list for Armor mods so I’m basing my guesses assuming all the mods for Leather and CB are available on the other armor types (obviously the toughness mods are different names buttressed/BOS/Studded/Polished etc)
---
"oh hi Mark"
---
I had thought that too, but I don't really remember Rose's voice too well
---
They need to run that double XP weekend again, if they did that every two weeks it would be pretty sweet :)
---
It's good to play as another build. My main is (explosive) shotgun/melee, and those shotguns got nerfed in the last patch (the explosive effect, which for some reason was still at 100%, is now 20%). I got my sniper build to level 50 by the time it ended.
---
Lmao first of all Communism is a political theory. It doesnt matter what any countries have done before. Communism is simply the abolition of private property, social classes, money, and the state. Paying each labourer according to the actual labor they produce rather than the capital they own. Thats it. Thats communism. The way in which its achieved is seperate. That doesnt affect what Communism is.
---
Fascism, on the other hand, is a form of radical, right wing, authoritarian, ultranationalism, giving all power to the state and the dictatorship running it. Fascism supports Imperialism, a mixed economy, and social classes. 
---
Fascism: State&gt;Citizen
---
Communism:State&lt;Citizen
---
They are literally polar opposites. Like you do know Fascism is a Far-Right ideology, and Communism is Far-Left right? Like this isnt a debate. Its widely agreed upon that they are opposites.
---
Good old buttressed...cost me about 40k in mats crafting and scrapping marine armor
---
Just turn on her radio station for a minute.  It's definitely the same voice.
---
The chance of getting milk was lowered a patch or two ago, also there is a bug if you recently milked a brahmin then fast travel away and back, the prompt shows even if it is too soon to milk again
---
Ayyyye 9.5 comes out on my bday!
---
Thanks! Good to Know. Crimson sounds like a winner
---
Yes,I do. I have a image of it, just I can't share it here.
---
If that’s the case and it was just released , maybe that’s why it doesn’t work
---
It's definitely not the same person who did Moira though
---
I must be lucky b/c I have all the top toughness modifications except buttressed Raider Legs...the only one I had to craft and scrap to get was Trapper torso buttress...I crafted a ton of CB but that was to learn the BOS helm lol
---
They did previously but changed their stance during the patch.
---
Following. I'm at work but now I'm excited.
---
It's urinalism, just as an FYI.  😎
---
See above, griefers.
---
This is an extreme that is happening but probably 1 in 10000. Its not even worth talking about. Worst case i simply have to jump servers or move my base 2 inches for a free repair
---
Yeah very rare and almost never happens. 1 in 10000
---
Damm thats lucky . I have 1056h played and i scrap every piece of scrappable armor i see and still 0 of the "best" mods . Fuck rng
---
Entirely possible. Was just hoping someone else that's done it would lemme know if I'm just dumb lol
---
Got sidetracked and haven't made it home yet. If you're ski on in 20 I'll hit you up, if not I appreciate the offer 👍
---
You need the tickets to use the train station there opening next week. Alll Aboardddddd *choo choo*
---
It's not, it's been around for a while.
---
Walk around point pleasant, lots in the woods just outside town
---
Sorry except for marine then ofc
---
We've been purved...
---
There's a power plant you have to turn on at vault tec. Somewhere down in the actual vault is a switch you have to flip.
---
r/isovilkku
---
Also u can kick them the second they get there.
---
Side note: what do we think the odds are that the ATLAS weather control project is gonna factor into the story of Nuclear Winter?
---
😉🤙🏻
---
Answering again for visibility - this quest has been around for a while. He needs to power up the centrifuge by going into the vault and flipping a switch.
---
Since the patch 9 i researched prices and was charging 10k for some of my 2 star and 3 star exploding bullets weapons and 5k for 2 star and 3 star bos heavy armor. I dont even have a mule haha wtf was i thinking. Heaps visits but nobody bought anything. I lowered my prices way down and sold almost all of my weapons today. Players are smart to wait and look around for reasonably priced vendors. I took pics of robot vendors prices and sell bulk for the same price. Today i am no longer over encumbered and i can finally begin to enjoy nopa build.[my current vendor prices](https://i.imgur.com/FAM0rIV.jpg)

Add me (I’m off line now) but have all the serums 300c ea

Ign: Robrx2
---
A gold blade knife would weigh more, not less. Gold is heavy
---
I try to do the same it's nice to help and makes game fun for noobies
---
my nocturnal Gatling does great damage, but yeah, pretty useless 50% of the time. Be nice to have a night event that makes use of nocturnal weapons.
---
If I spawn in someones camp and it's a bad spawn I click the social menu find their name and message them about it and if they are at there camp I will show them where I spawned so they can fix it.
---
It's like triangle or Y on console at the menu but the scrip prices aren't in game menu it's on the actual link to the inside the vault article
---
This game is what you make of it.
---
After the server not responding message the team communication disconnects from all team members, need to log out &amp; relog back in, 5 times in an hour.
---
It is becoming very frustrating to the point of unplayable- please fix it, this is since the new patch.
---
Dollysodds Daily awarded stingwing mounted recipe.
---
Actually where my camp is and I couldn't think of how to explain to this guy where it I'd but yes many there and then to overseers theres tons of bloodleaf
---
LERGENDERY SCRAP CIP AT 1000.
---
Ye thats the only one i got for now
---
Where are they spawning now?!?!
---
If you mean the menu where you pick from resume/atomic shop/challenges, it’s not triangle or any other button. Sucks I can’t find it anywhere
---
The pioneer scout daily event where u gotta find bug parts rewarded me with one.my guess is doing it over will give a different one
---
Maybe make a new Diamond City with just markets and houses everywhere like something out of Rust.
---
Plot twist, brahmin built the death pit
---
Pretty sure it's bugged and should be fixed soon, but yeah right now it sucks.
---
Daily quest at dolly sods.
---
You can name your power armor?
---
Did you get anything other than the stingwing
---
can you imagine if it was implemented by using a holotap text
---
I assume it’s based on your level, for example a level 10 player isn’t gonna get a level 50 legendary but a level 100 would get a level 45-50 legendary every time
---
I hit the same wall yesterday. There is a power up terminal inside the simulation vault, but without any option to power up anything. I'm not sure, but it could be a bug.
---
If I can find a stable (Xbone) server, I will lol.
---
Honestly I cant remember.
---
Also worth note, the crossbow has INSANE vats range, I went ghoul hunting in morgantown as part of the Pioneer chain, and I had some great ranges on the thing.
---
Add this to your list:
---
- TSE is no longer the best weapons
---
- Find Bloodied Explosive legit
---
I think there’s a few in the Vault Tec Agricultural Center
---
Communism is when you give things away. 
---
The more stuff you give away, the communistier it is.
---
Personally I prefer the chat. I got a mic specifically for this game because as a console user, it's a real pain trying to type a message. Direct talk is easier, simpler,quicker and with less misunderstanding for me.
---
Bigtime.
---
My shop has a row of instruments and my customers play them while they look around, I built it over a stream on a ledge above a small ravine. There is a walkway going up across the ravine to it and a natural path down on the other side. It's no refined department store but is called "Welcome" lol as I like to have people stop by.
---
Yes!! That’s why I didn’t use that serum I sold it off. I watched multiple YouTube videos &amp; they basically said you needed the canned dog food perk because it’s so easy to find &amp; it’ll help you because you’ll constantly starving. Idk about everyone else but even without speed demon I feel like I’m already starving or parched 75% of the time lol so I definitely knew I didn’t want it
---
Ah, darn. Thanks for the reply, now I can ignore another broken daily.
---
You have to land the final blow on her to get credit
---
No at the main menu not in game pause
---
I feel like this wont be a thing until private servers come out and people can remove build limits themselves. Id imagine it could have a negative effect on server stability on the live servers
---
Stimpack super wont count I found out . Gotta be a regular stimpack to prompt revive option .
---
You were too low level and didn’t bother to read the material about the event, so you went in woefully underpowered and blind. Not the game’s fault.
---
They're useful if you want to build another character (not that most people want to do I admit). But for all the times I got decent weapons or armor at a lower level because of other players in the area, I just kept a few back to start another build eg. a level 1 bloodied hunting rifle from an eyebot in Whitesprings
---
 https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/
---
Go there &amp; look at the Inside the Vault blog post. It’ll show you the scrip price list
---
I love this so much.
---
I 100% am betting her name is Mama, but filtered through that mask garbles it.
---
Doesn’t work half of the time though. Super glitchy quest for me at least. Wouldn’t let me power on the centrifuge no matter what. I assume the rewards are crap so no point
---
I'm going to remove all the doors I have. Yup. I'm that guy. Maybe I just prefer a true "open door" policy?
---
Or I'm just lazy.
---
And it's a video game...
---
It really does
---
Take a glance below at the comments below mine, lol
---
Since the new patch I’ve been blown away twice
---
Considering they'd had to push back quite a few things, I wonder if they were worried about over-promising and under-delivering in the context of the "76 is garbage" onslaught, and that's why it took a few months for the roadmap to finally hit, after they got the worse of the bugs sorted.
---
This interaction is hilarious😂
---
Here's what I did for a while to grind caps:
---
* Get the following perks: Butcher's Bounty III, Chemist, Super Duper III, Hard Bargain III  
---
* Make sure you know how to craft Blood Packs, Stimpaks, and Diluted Stimpaks.  
---
* Kill Ticks. Start at Vault 76, go south to the moonshiner's shack, then continue south to the lumber mill, server hop, rinse repeat. Make sure you have Butcher's Bounty equipped and search every tick. Collect as many blood sacs and tick blood as you can carry.  
---
* Craft a metric fuckton of stimpaks. You'll need blood packs which you'll craft from blood sacs and tick blood, plus antiseptic you get from blood sacs.  If you have a good stockpile of purified water, Chemist lets you turn one stimpak into four diluted stimpaks, and Super Duper bumps that number up. You may run low on antiseptic; farm sentry bots, they are easy kills and drop antiseptic.  
---
* Now sell those diluted stimpaks. User Hard Bargain and maybe some grape mentats to boost your sale price. You can easily max out the vendor pool for very little effort this way, so if you're frugal you can get 1400 per day. It's slow and steady, but it's good money.  
---
* Orrrr... farm legendaries all day and sell your loot on the proper subreddit. Your choice.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Imagine the struggle for a strength 1 character only using the ordinance card for weight reduction. Nah its not a struggle actually, its called role playing.
---
I have won 3 from this event so far, all bugs.
---
LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE
---
Like hell, I'm going to make my shop a spectacle! I want people to walk in and say, "Well, shit, I don't need this furious minigun, but at least it was a cool fuggin store!"
---
What stops them from just trading and settting item price very high? What about mules that hold there caps pretty sure this wouldn’t be an issue
---
Oooh I've gotten two mounted tick plans from this one so far so this might be where we get the mounted bug plans at the very least. ♡ Exciting.
---
Yes. I'm not 100% sure that they're guaranteed, some people have been saying it's like a 25% chance to get badges from them. But so far I've gotten one from each.
---
I haven't gotten one from the event though, but it is possible.
---
50% of the new posts here are people who don’t read or know how to use google.
---
I’ve gotten rad roach, bloatfly, and tick too.
---
Yeah, a little popup notification happens like when you receive loot from a quest (the little left side popup, not the big screen covering stuff). But once it's gone, it's gone.
---
So only bugs? No one found other non bug heads?
---
It does work with the hazmat suit, which is nice for nuke zones.
---
They did cover this in the announcement, sadly some fucking asshole decided to nerf this before it even launched.
---
I just hit max and that was with buying a bunch of junk from vendors all day
---
“You load 16 tons
---
And what do you get?

Another day older

And deeper in debt.

Agreed I need to know!
---
Same here. Plus every time I get disconnected my machine is empty have to restock and put price back on everything.  4 times now
---
Why yes, yes it does
---
Going to see if my friend is on. He wanted it
---
Thanks much!!!!
---
Three tadpole badges will get you the backpack. After that you can get possum badges to use to buy mods at the vending machine at the pioneer camp
---
over repairing doesn't work anymore. I mean, you can over repair to have your armor last longer, but it won't get any bonus DR.
---
also DR and end/HP mean a whole lot of nothing in Fo76. people complain about "getting oneshot all the time in pvp by op weapons" when, in truth, it's partially because everyone is a wet noddle.
---
Once you become a possum I think you need 8 merit badges to buy the backpack. Then if you want one from the atomic shop you have to buy the skin to go over the possum backpack.
---
I don't know, and I am not 100% sure on that one. Just that a few people have posted screenshots of them on the maps.
---
I've never seen it or had it happen to a friend. I'm sure it has happened, and does happen, but so do stabbings at playgrounds. Doesn't mean its common or worth worrying about when i walk my dog at the park.
---
Interesting. Please update if found!
---
Not at all speaking from experience, but the FBI fielded 10mm MP5s and seemed to love them but there was not a big enough demand for them elsewhere so production was discontinued. Also didn't help that they required more range time to master and ammo was harder to find. .45 ACP was already more common and the whole concept was pretty much dropped in time for the UMP to come knocking.
---
For Garrahan, there is a small little display stand that says 'Pioneer Scouts Sign In', it's on the 1st floor in the conference room (or a break room? hard to remember). Same as the one on the 5th floor of Hornwright.
---
You get it for complete if the initial quest. Do the 2 new daily scout related events, revive a player, and earn the 3 badges you mentioned.
---
Its happened a few times to me aswell. She ended up coming back around... At full health with 2:30 minutes left.
---
Trolls of reddit are not even .01% of game population. In 40 invites havent even had a tile moved.
---
I get what your saying. But literally last week I was a tank and this week I’m getting killed by a single glowing one , at half health, in pa....
---
All I get are those damn Mr. Gutsy robots and they chew through my health and tank bullets like hell.
---
No you get a backpack when you first become possum by getting 3 Tadpole badges. Then when you become
---
Possum you can earn possum badges, earning possum badges gets you mods for the backpack and 8 patches gets you a refrigeration/cooler mod
---
I found a level 16 one and stabbed it to almost death with a low level combat knife to finish with the syringer
---
Probably on pc? Mods are cheaters imo, no matter how benign they claim the mod is
---
Once you become a possum with three Tadpole badges you get a backpack with 30 carry weight. Then you can earn possum badges after that to buy mods
---
Every time I've moved where I thought my building would fit, it wouldn't. 
---
So I don't bother any more.  I look at as an opportunity to try a new architecture.
---
Upvote for dope name 👍
---
I've done all of these lmao
---
You seem fun. We should hang out.
---
If youre on ps4 I can gift you one. Ive got about 6 now that the deluxes spawn in world containers. Not sure if it will start the quest or you need the note.
---
I honestly don't know whats left to learn, that might be your problem as well. It's rare that I get one, but I still scrap every bit of armor I find.  Every 100 or so I get a new shit mod that I don't care about.
---
I get what your saying. But literally last week I was a tank and this week I’m getting killed by a single glowing one , at half health, in pa.... maybe it’s not the damage resistance, because the DR is “the same” numbers I had over a week ago, maybe they buffed enemies then.... point is... something is different... and I don’t think it was the over repairing“bonus DR” that aloud me to take hits from several ghouls ... and now not be able to fend off one
---
Aye.
---
How long should the crossbow take to break? I’ve shot about 40 bolts and still hasn’t went down in durability. I don’t have the gunsmith perk activated, or any perk that increases the durability.
---
I thought everything was spoiling. Doh.
---
dam campfire event doesn't give me  any badge at all.
---
Im funner than you'd think.
---
Really? I get it every time I go to the Watoga train station for the day. And I've spent a LOT of time in Watoga, never gotten it before.
---
I just drop nukes on people's houses.
---
So I have to find a random power plant in the vault? Sheesh, even if there isn't a quest marker they could at least say "power on the plant" or something. Thanks!
---
I haven't seen any relevant changes in the ESM. Which PA and paint job are you using?
---
Paint job matters because the damage &amp; rad reduction of PA is attached to the paint. Everything I've checked is the same, but one might be missing.
---
It would have to be the right sort of implementation. I stopped using the text chat mod because it was used more like an in-game discord than character to character chat. Got way to spammy with irrelevant chatter.
---
If only information like that was written down somewhere before releasing the patch... I mean, were that info conflicting in any way, it might cause all sorts of confusion.
---
A visual definition of yeeting.
---
Which system?
---
If PC, mods?
---
If yes, update your custom.ini
---
Happened to me 2 patches back, adding the new ba2 files to the custom.ini list fixed it.
---
There is definitely some wankiness with hits registering regardless. But absolutely zero hit is off.
---
 Lvl 50 Excavator , bone raider.
---
get chemist perk and the chemist scrounger perk and run around hospitals and hotels searching doctors bags, med kits, and medicine cabinets. 1300 caps is peanuts.
---
Wait.... you can WHAT!?!?      Explain. Can I use this to get the high cases in breach and clear.
---
Haha, thank you kindly
---
Appears the latest patch is the partial cause of the floating section problem.  Just added the finishing touches to the Chapel build – https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bkuhk0/pleasant_valley_chapel_camp_2x2x1_34_compact_build/ which already included half brickworks and a slanting roof (3rd May) when the serious bug occurred! Unfortunately when adding a slanting brickwork or slanting roof to a half brick wall or full size selection (next to the staircase) it keeps say the section is floating and won’t connect! This BUG is driving me Mad. I’ve tried every conceivable way, even stripping the whole build back to it’s original design and basic foundations to no avail. Re-booting, moving C.A.M.P. doesn't work.
---
One question does Bethesda have different versions of their software when patching or adding content to Fallout 76? As every occasion one bug or glitch is fixed another old error re-appears.
---
Until this patch, it never used to show up unless you read terminals at Fort Defiance, IIRC.
---
Thank you. Still kickin ass 5 months later.
---
I've been having that since I bought the game a week after launch. Long arms (rifles, shotguns) will miss at close range, too, even when they shouldn't.
---
I go by ammo first as it takes awhile for an average player to acumulate it, then I look for plans, mods etc. If they have quute a few high level people there and alot of stuff I'll bite but thats been my method and its worked so far for me.
---
This isn't new at all. I got this mission the first time I went to fort defiance like maybe 4 months ago?
---
Nice backlash, blind fanboys.
---
Ty btw for replying... even if that’s not the issue, very interesting information to know that dr &amp; rads are tied to paint jobs
---
No one is getting banned for mods unless they're like god mode or something.
---
Just lurk the market subs and other trading communities until you get a sense of what people are buying and selling things for.
---
Yea I thought you could use mods on pc? Maybe I’m wrong I’m on console.
---
I'm not getting it there, I'm getting it in Watoga.
---
not saying that you're wrong, something definitely feels off, although I can't pinpoint exactly what so it might be just my imagination, but because of how DR works in Fo76, those few extra points might actually be it.
---
DR isn't linear and is completely worthless at lower levels. you might as well be naked. then it begins to work once you hit a certain threshold, and everything from then on makes a massive difference. even 10 points.
---
Damn you really using internet explorer
---
All aboard the COLE TRAIN BABY!! WOOOOO!
---
Is this ?
---
[Marine Armor Helmet](https://imgur.com/gallery/1b12ZQR) 
---
So Xbox or PS4?
---
Eh. Could have at least let us pick weapon model. I'm a shotgunner - I don't need to end up with rifles and shit. I was hoping to use this to roll double-barrels for my sidearm.
---
Okay? So what's your point? 
---
 Isn't this the one where you have to get socrchbeat DNA?
---
This is where all our taxes is going.
---
Unless your an assassin in real life, I rest my case.
---
For me its more of an equation between how many caps I've got &amp; how much bank space I hope to get back.
---
I dunno I listed some okay 3* at 500 and one dude bought em all. They were too good to scrip imo, so hopefully that wasn't what happened (bet you it was). But I was way too close to 25k to try &amp; charge too much more.
---
Well I know I need buttressed on Raider and enameled on Metal and robot...def not getting those 🤪
---
If you've only got a few mods remaining for an armor type then the chances are extremely low. IIRC it's either 0.75% or 0.85% per remaining mod.
---
Im curious what animals / monsters / enemies we are going to run into when this comes about as well as weather effects. Wonder if all the scenery is going to change or if we are getting seasonal effects and weather?
---
Yeah, but you can still find some gems.  Like a nuclear key card for 50 caps.  😉
---
how is increasing breast size cheating?
---
I’d kill for a full list of every mid for every armor type...does brawling come on Robot Arms?  IDK...etc etc
---
Most of my friends run full bloodied builds so there use to dieing lol it’s been quite a while since I’ve had to worry about it, and at first I chalked it up to my being careless but it definitely has been more challenging, and honestly I wouldn’t even be mad if they made a change to balance... Just would like to know so I can respec and better prepare.
---
Makes the noise but no dmg? Its like that sometimes.

Any explosive weapon is a rare drop. I had just 3 by level 120, but I had a dozen two shots. Most of my drops came from nuke zones at Whitesprings, where most are just 1 star weapons or armor. I found other areas like Watoga and West Tek give better results. Less drops in total but more 2 or 3 star legendaries. Best one yet is a B/E 10mm pistol.

A whole bunch of the musician challenges for Possum aren’t working for me :(
---
Thanks, but I maintain that if that's a step, it should be at least in the description in the quest.
---
Will add you in a couple minutes
---
I have 3 tadpole badges, but I don't have the backpack plan. Maybe it's because I haven't revived anyone? The Demonstrate Pioneer Scout Values quest is listed as 3/4.
---
For me it’s the lever action, handmades, and energy weapons.   I find so few of them in the wild, excluding the laser rifle, that I only have learned a few mods for them by scrapping. 
---
I finally gave up and bought the handmade plan from a vendor just so that I could build them to scrap to learn the mods.  
---
As far as the raider armor is concerned, I have been trolling the Top of the World area for the last few months picking up every plan and scrapping every piece of raider armor I could find.  I have most of the mods now, excluding Raider Power Armor, which is at the bottom of my list next to Crossbows...
---
Lately my focus has been on finding plans for T-60 and T-51b Power Armor.  I only know how to make one piece of each, and I only found those by doing the treasure maps.  
---
Yes, I can buy the plans at the Enclave vendor.  But I’ve been saving my caps to buy serum recipes to sell serums.
---
Ok.  No mic but chillin at my camp
---
Yes you also have to finish that quest. If it still says revive an ally then that’s the last part. My advice is to server hop til you find a sheepsquatch event because people drop like flies during that
---
Alright
---
Haven't collected enough toilet paper yet.  Plan on it though.  🤣🤣🤣
---
Thank you. My camp now regularly gets destroyed and more so than it used to than before. I’m worse off then when player griefing was a thing.
---
Even at 53 and maxed charisma perk (forgot it's name) it's still like 1200 :(
---
Platform?
---
Just craft a new one
---
When you start running out of things to do it’s fun to help other people level. That was before vendor machines, though. All I’m doing these days is shop. Not sure that’d do you any good unless you get XP for carrying bags. Probably not...
---
I rarely seem to learn armor mods in particular despite scrapping by many many pieces. 
---
BUT...I’ve bought so many cheap mod plans via player vending machines I’m a happy man
---
I did, it's cheap and easy, it's still annoying that suddenly I have a different backpack on
---
You can continue to get the tadpole badges too right?
---
I was lucky and got both done in one revive.
---
Aw hell
---
Nice! I'll have to try something similar. Thank you!
---
Or reskinning anything that only you'll see?
---
I'm pretty sure they did move on people using reshade at one point, but as far as I know one can use that micheviously? I've avoided it myself, though it's one of the first recommendations I see. Changing how posters look (that's one strange mod, you know the one) or a piece of clothing? Advantageous obviously... 
---
Frankly most of these are generally holes that BGS should've filled already. People consistently ask for perk card loadouts, mums the word (either direction a statement from BGS would be nice). I don't see how it honestly provides any scrupulous benefits, time to switch is fast but still slow enough you'd likely die in PVP trying to hotswap.
---
I had the same problem and bought it hoping I could get out of doing that awful grindy quest. Just another subversion on Bethesda's part. Oh well, it's still a better skin for that post-apocalyptic aesthetic anyway so that's something at least.
---
Good ol paint brushes
---
Guess I’m just used to it. But yeah that’s pretty annoying. I’ll definitely check when I get back on
---
I'm just thinking if they've changed where you get it, and it's in Watoga now, maybe it's bugged out? I dunno. I've never gotten it in Watoga before, have you? I'm willing to be wrong, but stuff doesn't seem right with it.
---
Yep. Spoiled meat protesting crazy prices :D
---
Yeah, to add to the troubles I've got enemies spawning right inside my fence line (that enemies usually have to destroy to get in).
---
I would have thought that at least spawns inside the camp boundary would be suppressed, but how ai in bethesda games just decide to teleport sometimes maybe they are spawning outside.
---
I had to go to fort defiance and get the letter that used to start the quest before it would let me power up the centrifuge.
---
I’m so upset that PC players can mod their game to fix things like this &amp; customize their UI &amp; shit but us console players just have to deal with it until BSG decides they want to fix it. Sad state of a game man.
---
I saw my friend get it in watoga today. Maybe you picked up a holotape or read a letter relating to it.
---
Hi, long time pooper, first time caller. As a mildly mutated, fully psychotic wastelander that has shit in many a bed, toilet, and pool table... I'm happy to see so many brave new souls embrace the poopocalypse. With a little teamwork, I see no reason why we can't poop in every bed across the wasteland! Our destiny awaits!
---
then take some giant steps while whistling my favorite things...
---
Yup, you can use the badges to purchase things from the tadpole vending machine
---
Well the event Distant thunder is a great way to pick up the base PA Plans like helm arms etc...and a crashing assload of motion assist servo Plans 🤮
---
Xbox
---
You don’t need to wait for that event. Just go to it’s location and when you get to the main steps or around there it should activate.
---
This is Fucking SICK AS FUCK I LOVE YHIS GAME
---
 Cool, just joined
---
Someone made a cage inside their camp for when people came to their vending machines. So I used my orbital strike beacon right in the heart of his base :-)
---
Well I’m one of those gotta learn everything types...only 28 plans that I don’t know...maybe 15-20 scrap to learn armor mods...short list but I’m soooooo close
---
I did spend close to max caps yesterday buying 3* stuff but it was all junk 3*. So probably wasn’t yours. If it was cheap I bought it. Especially if it was light weight. Wasn’t anything I would sell on here but definitely worth the scrip trade in. I had too many caps anyway
---
I disagree entirely but i guess this is really subjective.
---
I have made 500 caps off of toilet paper, gotta keep those people leaving bags of fertilizer on people's beds well supplied.
---
It's actually the hidden PA-specific damage and rad percentage reduction that's tied to the paint job, not the DR and ER. 42% for damage (7% per piece), 90% for rads (15% per piece).
---
Can't see anything special about Bone Raider though. Should work as usual, although the over-repair nerf will hurt it a bit more than the other PAs.
---
Is this mod worth getting? I think the railway vendor near Top of the World.
---
PS4 :)
---
Actually in mythology silver is harmful to both! Something to do with its religious associations
---
It's a scrap unlock with a high probability. Scrap a few 50cals and you should get it.
---
As a human wearing in my skin 'Nihil Verum, Omnia Licita' this excited me so FUCKING much.
---
Just opening the map every now and then and checking it out. I really should mind my own business!!
---
Nope. It pops for me upon getting to Watoga for the first time in a day. It did it yesterday, and it did it today.
---
Wasn't a video released last night/yesterday of a new duping method?
---
It was explained to me, and then clicked as to why the servers were so unstable yesterday.
---
I believe the unscheduled maintenance was to patch this. 
---
Dupers: stop fucking with our servers! I'm not even gonna bitch about what it does to in game economy or people having weapons they shouldn't. But FFS can you not crash the servers every time?
---
I have a mic but I won't use it in this game.  Too many mouth breathers eating into their microphone, arguing with a family member or some other shit.  I really don't care, turning the player chat off was the best thing I have done in the game or any similar game.
---
Recently I started to recreate the bar from Cheers and make my guy look like Ted Danson. The chin slider doesn't protrude far enough.
---
I always have a mic next to me ready, if you can't talk to someone on a game that you don't even know. How are you ever going to talk to people out in the real world?
---
I have crippling anxiety and find it so much easier talking to people online than real life.
---
We had the SBQ go to Wotoga. One minute filling her full of lead, next she took off and went to the far side of the Wotoga train station, we followed, killed all the robots we thought were agroing her, but she would not move from her position in the sky. She looked like she was stuck up there in the one position, until we waved her down with bullets. Looted and went back to original fight area to find a second SBQ corpse and then another one just outside the Wotoga train station. Killed one SBQ, three corpses.
---
Killed a level 80 SB in the nuke area, but did not loot, went back to Wotoga train station and as I walked outside the station door a SB body fell in front of me and it had loot. Looks like the SB corpse had followed me to give me the loot?
---
Fuck knows bro maybe they changes the start location since people weren't doing it?
---
Yea I wasted a bunch on a mirelurk Queen twice my level I kept panicking cuz she hurt
---
Leader of the...oh, never mind.
---
i just started out, i’m level 12 currently. my experience with every single 50+ player i’ve met has been a paper bag full of goodies 
---
on behalf of the newbies, thank you (all)
---
(just realised plans had to be read in the pip-boy which makes alot of the dropped items even more awesome )
---
this game is kinda really fun
---
From what I've noticed, items in the vendor box tend to sell for cheaper than the market subs. I'd recommend looking at those and adjusting by 20-40%
---
Who waaaaants to dieeee in the behemoth lakee? :D
---
Man I need to start saving. Gotta cut back to only the essentials and find a way to start making caps.
---
I'm usually between 10-20 for a bulk stack. I sell gears, springs, and adhesive in bulk.
---
I sell ballistic for about 7 per, but no one has bit on that yet. Seems like a deal and I'm not letting it go for less. 
---
Screws are like 3 per.
---
Got 1 for 3k. The inflation is entirely artificial.
---
I earnestly hope they stop wasting dev time on PVP content at all. We all have different things we enjoy, and other things we personally think are wastes of time. 
---
Loot is the central preoccupation of...every single RPG I've ever played.
---
That sounds like the BOTW fairy ring pool. 
---
If you go under the water there you’ll find skeleton in the classic Link dash pose surrounded by three sets of rocks in a loose triforce outline.[Triforce pond photo](https://twitter.com/idmachina/status/1126726461681881093?s=21) 
---
They got me hard when the game first came out. I saw the fairy circle and thought, “this is just like Zelda! I should jump down and something special will happen.”
---
Only to be one quickly reminded that isn’t a Zelda game and that fall damage is 100% a thing.
---
I've gotten two in the last week!
---
My first one ever was in a nuke zone, player saw it happen and tried to kill me before it was available to be taken.
---
I've never killed someone out of pure rage like I did this player. 😂😂
---
Besides the notification that pops up it'll make a caps noise as you make de money
---
I should have realized it was mod related. Thanks!
---
One in stash. Other in vending machine for 7.5k 😂😂
---
X don't invalidate Y.
---
Welcome to the champions club
---
I have to scroll left to right to read through your post, and it's contained in a box so you can only see a portion of it, requiring you to scroll. Maybe it doesn't look that way on mobile.
---
do a run down the main highway in the mire. the last four runs I've done have resulted in two mothmen, two sheepsquatches, hearing a third sheepsquatch.. I'd say it's pretty good odds. I start at the pumpkin house and run it to the edge of the cranberry bog.
---
Well your armor doesn’t work when your in PA so I figured the backpack wouldn’t either. I can carry 450lbs without PA but when I put on the PA I can only carry 300+. All your armor is removed when in PA
---
Mines at 7.5k I don't actually expect anyone to buy, I just thought it'd be funny to put a ridiculous price on it.
---
I think it would be helpful to lower level players. 
---
Knowing what they are aiming at like you can with the robot vendors. Having an aim for any grinding is always helpful imo. 
---
And the ability to sell stuff whilst not logged in would be useful for people who don't get a lot of game time each week.
---
Not a bad idea! People don’t think things through lol!
---
No.  No they didn't, just the dickheads ran around with unlimited carry weight exploits fucking the server up.
---
Optimist.
---
Thanks man. Appreciate it. :)
---
last time i did the path to enlightenment event, the super mutants were glitched and just stood there on spawning. easiest i've ever seen that event.
---
I got this quest a couple of days ago when I went to Watoga. Ended up getting the scorch beast dna when I was doing a SBQ event. One of the normal SBs were killed and when I went to loot it it had a harvest dna option.
---
But had the same problem as you ( OP ) when went to Vault tec uni to complete the quest.
---
You have to go to Fort Defiance to trigger the password for the terminal to power things up at VT uni.
---
Then you can complete the quest. I got a level 40 telsa which was below my pay grade.
---
Too bad it didn’t destroy anything
---
I like it!
---
This.  Bethesda knows it too.
---
To be honest, I'm still kind of amazed we have a full camp building system in an online game at all. Was amazed with it on fallout 4.....never dreamed I'd actually be able to build a camp in an online fallout though.
---
So I'm already more than happy with it just as it is.
---
Spam x or whatever your activate key is.  Sometimes you'll milk em, sometimes they'll kick their leg and run off.  Got all 10 this way in 3 server hops of Flatwoods.
---
I accidentally had weapon artisan enabled when I repaired mine the first time, as I didn't see the (3x) and thought I only needed to repair it once. Since I was using my legendary crossbow I thought I might as well repair it to 200%. Poor choice. Those fuckers are durable anyway.
---
Should be raider or harpers ferry or watoga vendors.
---
Conversely I'm having a lot harder time with fences.
---
Where before they were quite fiddly with sloping terrain, now I constantly fight with - Intersects with an existing object, or Needs support, or The selected item is floating.
---
Increases the damage.
---
Thanks.  Will save us from a thousand Youtube videos.
---
This is the answer.
---
I just did it but I had to log and then it unlocked.
---
No problem champ.
---
I got a pretty good stand alone mic. 
---
Well I already met a lvl 105 dude who I first thought he attacked me but then dropped me 5 stimpacks and 10 purified water. I was surprised.
---
Drill and syringer are not in this loot pool. Each armor set has 3 weight variants as well except urban, forest, and wood which only have the one. You end up with a higher chance of getting an armor than anything else.
---
FUCK THE BAG
---
Amen!
---
I don't care if this is the right thread for this. Just ran into another player while browsing their wares and we both did the ??? over the Punch Bowl in their camp then shot the shit out of it together. No rhyme no reason. We just shot the punch bowl and went our separate ways. 
---
I swear to god this game is a Vault Tec simulator. Put a bunch of people in a place and see how they act. Lots of assholes. Lots of people running around doing normal stuff. LOTS of people just being weird. I love it.
---
Also the urban and forest enclave armor are in this loot pool for the vendor as is wood
---
Drill and syringer are not in this loot pool. Not the same pool as the legendary enemies
---
You can scrap the stored plan and the materials will break down into the stored section.
---
But, don't leave to much in stored. It tends to lose things after time.
---
So you haven’t used once since they “removed damage on player bases in adventure” I see. Don’t comment until you try it buddy
---
Thanks
---
Don’t rush the leveling. Relish this time. This game is 100% best before you hit the soft cap and still have to fear everything. Enjoy!
---
You still launching? I’ve been on a bench at Watoga station for 15 min😂
---
Those are in the loot pool for the legendary vendor. Both enclave armors are and those pools don't have syringer or drill
---
Doesn't stack, what the hell?! Wow I'm glad I checked before waisting any badges on that refrigerated piece of garbage... Extra carry weight it will be for me.
---
A guy posted a comment saying he spoken to one of the managers and they are looking into it. 😋
---
Power armor is not in the loot pool. I don't think alien blaster is either but I'll have to double check
---
You're not getting text chat because this is a console game - that doesn't mean I'm say 'hur-dur, its a game for peasant', it means that it was designed for console hardware and I/O.  Which means 99.999999999999999999999999% of the players on console don't even have a keypad, let alone a keyboard.  
---
Consoles don't have keyboards.  Bethesda has made it clear that there will not be a separate version for the PC.
---
There’s 7 down in the basement of Vault Tec Agricultural and 1 upstairs in another room. If you leave there and follow the river up to Slocum’s Joes there is 3 on a log near the bus outside and 1 behind the back of Slocum’s up the hill.
---
In case I didn't already say this. The drill and syringer are not part of this loot pool. This is an entirely seperate mechanism from how legendary enemy drops are
---
Good idea with the receiver thanks!
---
Now if we could just get a nukashine paint for it 😊
---
[Multi-boxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-boxing) with Black Powder Rifles at Scorched Earth Event. Now that's dedication.
---
yeah, there's a list, but there's also a lot of mods you _only get mods for_ or only buy plans for, etc. At least as I understand it.
---
Private servers are likely to never come out.
---
Live servers have made gigantic strides in what they allow and can handle.  Moving it closer together won't affect servers at all, it'll get choppy for consoles and lower end PC's, though.  Probably why the building spaces are as far as they currently are.
---
If it's out I'm gonna nut
---
Mine got deleted when the Ever Upwards update came out. I was really upset but I know BSG ain’t gonna do shit so I just had to suck it up. Had a lot of early photos with my little brother, our first Mothman sighting, tons of memories. Just sucks man. Idk how this happens with no word or anything from Bethesda. Not even a sorry lol
---
Yep
---
The game is six months old.  Nobody is a veteran player.
---
I've been there for months. So there. :P
---
This may explain the "white" color textures over the terrain sometimes?
---
You’re damn right we did. And we never had no flabbergasting backpack to help us either.
---
anything for the horsemen armors?
---
Oh i wish we could have different ammo for it. Like a flare one that tags shit for real.
---
Cool, just making sure you didn’t disconnect or something
---
The quest is slightly bugged as it now pops up whether you've done it before or not. You're supposed to start it first time at Fort Defiance by reading Scribe Grant's terminal which would lead to get the password, power up the VTU terminal etc.
---
I’m on my way
---
So that's why my stores keep running out of it...
---
The only issue I had building is that you still get the "object cant be placed in water" if you're close to a waterfall/rapids and I couldn't place a regular size floor in one spot on my third floor and had to use 4 quarter sized boards. The regular sized board gave me the intersect error for some reason. Think it had something to do with the stairs below it. The boards don't match, but it's better than having a giant hole in the floor.
---
That will come as christmass present patch :D
---
S C R I P
---
This; It's a quest that starts from fort D, or at least that's where you unlock it.
---
Until recently, you had to visit each vendor to get your cap limit for the day.  It was a pain. So I developed a strategy to get as many plans as I could though regular game play instead of spending caps.   
---
I got mine from simply doing Power Plant events each day, taking over the local workshop, and doing the first defend event and the recapturing it later, once I was sure that it was overrun vs taken by another player. 
---
I found that taking over the workshops at power plants and the various events around it netted me several CAMP type plans a day.   Furniture, lighting, and building plans.   Do that for a couple of weeks and you’ll find that you’ll have a decent enough collection to build an interesting CAMP.  
---
You’ll get similar rewards from other workshops, I just found the Power Plant workshops to be the most consistent.  
---
That being said, I did end up buying a few “I really want that” plans that never seemed to drop for me.
---
Interesting for me it show all correctly.
---
Server hopping this location was the easiest for me to kill 10 radrats.  TY!
---
PSN: CaptainModrah 
---
I’ll help you out when I’m on
---
Figured someone would help us all out.
---
ew. website that wants me to turn off my adblocker.  fuck that
---
Also, you can find ticks or bloodbugs at Point Pleasant.  Either one of those will spawn there, but not both.
---
I have a 3 star nocturnal automatic gamma gun. It was my first three-star anything. It's super fun for recharging ghouls while other players try to kill them at whitesprings.
---
I’d love to help (which will help me clear the challenges simultaneously of course hahaha)
---
Add me up!
---
I’m lvl 15 and my vendor is filled with weapons and armor that vary from lvl 30-50
---
It's now telling me I cant drop it, I'm sorry
---
Check title again. It is rng so sometimes you get two from two events, sometimes zero from six events.
---
The first time I got it was off a quest chain from For D. It eventually sends you near the prime rift. After that, it seems to trigger in Watoga, as it's the closest place to the prime rift. 
---
It's not new at all. Maybe it just triggers more accurately/often/in a wider zone now.
---
That’s okay
---
And back to the doors again. The stall-door for my shower is not automated!
---
Exactly. It's not YOU damaging the base, so much as it's the orbital strike platform. 
---
I have a veritable shit-ton of orbital strike beacons. They're so much fun.
---
Do it at your camp, kill the brahmin and then store the producer. You should be able to place it again and a new brahmin will spawn that can be milked immediately.
---
And your in game business isn’t worth the risk to me or many others over you spending your own 1 &gt; 40 caps fast traveling
---
*shrugs*
---
I need help with this too
---
I’ll help you out as well
---
Add me
---
Done now but may need you for the revive while in water challenge
---
Its a paragraph in mobile. All on screen.
---
Reddit doesn't like me.
---
Sigh
---
Learned about that too late...
---
Then I forgot about it.
---
And remebered about it too late.
---
Yeah it sounds like it went squirelly for you for some reason. For my there was always a quest blip leading me right to the objects with which to interact. 
---
Some of the other replies indicate that you may need to have a password or somesuch from Fort D to do parts of it? I dunno, I've never done it in the order that you are trying.
---
Get the mutations you want and then NEVER remove the starched genes perk.
---
Had problems to spell things like this from memory since vanila world of warcraft. 
---
My brain is full of item/area names, thats why i forgot thing in real life!
---
No. Just died a few times. Lol
---
Lol my luck is 6 I have good with salt and I switch other perks like crazy I have all my special stats where I want them
---
You get the caps directly to your inventory and a notification in the top left
---
Looks like all four of them are in there. They probably do this by copy-pasting one of the other paints, so an omission isn't very likely.
---
fuuuuuuuuuuuu^^uuuuuuuuuuuuu^^^uuuuuuuck yes.
---
I got my first 3* two shot drop today. Lvl 10 hunting rifle lol.
---
Stings and Things can award the following randomly: Tick, Radroach, Stingwing, Bloodbug, Bloatfly, Firefly.
---
Mods only
---
Something is definitly fucky with the tax rounding. Someone bought 47 Stimpaks from me for 7 caps ea. Taxed, that's 6.3 caps each which would round down to 6 caps. So I should have gotten 282 caps, but instead I only got around 140 caps.
---
Pray RNG gods to provide you better looot.
---
He means 25caps. The zeros are stupid and unnecessary.
---
I found the same thing just trying to do the archery one. And so many involve the camera, I couldn’t care less about a damn camera in Fallout or taking pictures.
---
You sure you didn’t scrap or destroy the level 50 you crafted and equipped the free one that is level 20?
---
Only Paladin Danse is allowed to dance.
---
Haha that's a great idea :)
---
It is reward from that quest. (I was adding this to the list of which trophies people got)
---
Oh, good advice.
---
Guy doesn't even have Free States flair -- what a loser.
---
BF told me he did a lot of event hopping because the cost to teleport would always be made back from event completion. That and selling just about everything. So I'm trying that. Not doing too amazing tho lol.
---
I think all the TSEs are just folks returning to the game since January.   I haven’t seen a huge volume of BEs.  If duping occurred again it was small-scale.
---
&gt; That's why the insult "cuck" has become so prominent
---
No, that's because right wing nut jobs are usually racists with weird sexual hang ups.  (This is actually confirmed by scientific research).
---
My camp is on a medium-sized, highly radioactive lake. My camp module is right on the edge of the water. My spawn point is the other frigging side of the lake, well outside the bounds of my camp.
---
Craft a fresh level 50 for +60 carry weight. The free one is only level 20
---
Refrigeration, need to keep my beer cold.
---
I just spent the last hour thinking it was bugged or something because I couldn’t get some of them to count.
---
Can you sell them to people?
---
This is exactly it. Check all the dates for that information; a lot of it was early on in FO76 or even before it was released; people assumed it would be like FO4.
---
It's not. You don't get screws.
---
Farming adhesive through veggies next to a purified water source is super accessible now that player vending is a thing.
---
Read the release notes. It specifically states it doesn’t work in PA and when it was first said it would, that info was shared in error. Backpacks were not intended to work in PA and were released to not work in PA.
---
Sadly disagree don't increase the build budget. At present the servers are insufferably slow, with the added pressure of vendor machines, and additional C.A.M.P. content impacting on the games performance. Unfortunately the engine canna take it (voice of Scotty). Yes building a C.A.M.P. is an integral part of the game, unless there is radical improvement in the engine it might advisable to amend your build. Unfortunately I've faced the same quandary and limitation but realise that sacrifices must be made to ensure the viability and overall performance of the game.
---
Yup, you're an asshole.
---
Never ever ever remove starched genes.
---
I have 7 mutations (and can make 4). I walked through a decon shower with starched genes level 3 equipped and was okay.
---
Im greedy and I want more haha
---
New perks? This would be a original idea! Reminds me of the tax guy from Witcher 3!
---
I liked using the pharma pharma perk early in the game and selling stimpacks and other chems to vendors. Save your caps and farm materials yourself. It is way easier to make caps now that all vendors share a pool of caps. Find a good area for your level to level/farm that is near a trainstation vendor and scrap/sell all you can.
---
Same here, I got raped by the yahoo guay like 10 times
---
I actually have max level Pharma Farma, and i'm still struggling with meds. All I ever get from Med Boxes are shitty chems and water. As for materials, I don't even know where to start honestly.
---
Hi, just added you
---
Im now waiting for other mods like lead or insulated to be shown.
---
New patch has disconnects happening again. The game is exactly the same game, content wise since the very beginning, with two new events and one medium sized interior cell with enemies. 
---
New patch has introduced long lists that require check marks beside them. They added these so when players say “there’s nothing to do” people on reddit will say “did you complete all the challenges?”, as if taking pictures and jumping through silly hoops like reviving an ally once is an adequate substitute for actual content. 
---
Still, the base game underneath all the bugs and stupid story and noncontent updates is still fun- to me. If you can ignore the complete lack of imagination the game displays beyond shooting and looting its worth picking up.
---
Yes, but where is Tower.River.Fork lol.
---
&gt; One interesting thing I've noticed and didnt expect is people are buying the lvl 50 Fixer. I keep making them.
---
I bought one because I hardly ever see Encryptid being run.
---
Maybe you should add a level 20 one?  Could be useful for low levels who don't dare do the quest yet.
---
Those shitty chems and water sell to vendors for a nice little profit.
---
Lame. It happened to me a couple of months ago. Now I screen shot them just in case. Especially now that there are so many photo centric challenges. We can’t add them back into the game, but at least we can keep and look at them if we want.
---
Assuming that the armor is still relevant (which it will be in this case), AA is worth about +29% damage after the DR calc, or the equivalent of +20% pip-boy damage. So Bloodied is better when you're below \~75% hp.
---
I’m on PS4.  Would love to join the company as an architect.    I really enjoy the building aspect.   If you want, you can drop by my CAMP just to see my style...   
---
I’m more into the quality customized high end CAMP that works with the natural features of the chosen location and to fits the clients tastes rather than you’re basic CAMP.
---
If nothing else, it would be cool to team up with a bunch of builders on a job site.   If nothing else, I’m sure that we could share a few techniques and share blueprints.
---
... I'm shy m8. I already stay shut in from the rest of the world I'm not trying to be social with internet randoms
---
I just played from 730 pm to 230 am, doing the camp fire quest, finally got 3 possum badges, used it to buy possum scout backpack plan, to find out that you can't craft the backpack until you complete the world challenges first...I am gonna kill myself

---
Saying exactly what? 
---
Do you think gaming companies go about checking and listing mods for their games? Even Wargaming took nearly a decade to get around to make "a list" of approved mods for WoT.
---
Do you have any idea how much mods there are for F76? All you need is a third party unapproved browser, and go check it out from Nexus. Mods range from tiny sound change mods with few downloads, to most popular inventory mod with 32k unique downloads.
---
Do you dare to use Bethesda forums with third party browsers? Here I assume Zenimax hasn't provided their own browser for anyone, neither a list of approved third party browsers :)
---
Have you logged a ticket about the issue on the bethesda support site?
---
The only people here are fans and a few customer reps.
---
you are needing tech support, not a we will pass it on.
---
I think I'll focus on small goals first: make it to level 25 so I can get my first full set of power armor. Figure out a build befitting a ~~mad~~ *agitated* scientist like myself. Do more events indeed! Learn more recipes since I'm my family's main crafter.
---
I'm sure we'll both make it in the end!
---
I’ll keep my eyes open for the event.
---
I run bloodied with adrenal, nerd, bloody mess, and 8 of the heavy damage cards
---
Lol yeah I get that, but a lvl 195 coming to help lvl 34 me clear a couple lvl 50 enemies just because they were in a place I wanted to check out is a bro move for sure.
---
It's possible OP is from Europe, where commas and periods are interchangeable in numbers.
---
Each time you switch starched genes out you risk forgetting to put it back. I’ve played 400 hours and never needed good with salt.
---
It's not just bugs it's any flying enemy same thing happens with eyebots/bombs and even landed scorchbeasts.
---
Sorry I was talkimg about in the UK. Within a mont of launch there were crazy deals with the game being reduced by 50-60%. So pre owned it must be cheeper now!
---
Just move your other features slightly higher.
---
Did you get his gamer tag I would like to meet him and do the jump as well
---
PC has no photo limit rip
---
The signs for the courses are pretty obvious lol. The start and end are clearly marked haha
---
I believe in you! I'm 53 and my build is kinda.. weird. I should have paid attention months ago. Thank goodness for the respec update.
---
Could be, 720 hours in game, CAMP close to Watoga, spent countless days down here, never started getting this quest here before the update Tuesday.
---
No just the wendigo and all the others everyone knows about
---
I settled for bashing it against things till it barely dipped below...
---
Now for possum badge grinds -_-
---
Assuming that you'd be running all of those with either weapon, it doesn't change the numbers. &lt;75% hp, bloodied is better. &gt;80% hp, AA is better.
---
Well I did a little testing with a laser gun and was getting 26 AP per shot. Presumably an automatic laser would cost 13 AP per shot. That is pretty cheap. I would maybe try a sneak attack critical hit build. Those make anything powerful. I got by just fine with a 10mm pistol for a very long time.
---
I got a friend coming back to the game. I may create a new character with laser weapons in mind.
---
You should ask, i would tell you that it is skin. I am sorry for your bad feelings.
---
No, you are wrong. There is no point grinding legendaries. If that's what you do, it will just sooner or later leave you empty and dissatisfied. I see threads by these grinders all the time.
---
But why you mention below level 50? I think you didn't get what I suggested, by mentionin other players.
---
He was always dead before.
---
Another one for you.
---
Melee VATS is not 'working' on flying nuisances (bloodbugs, stingwings etc) or enemies that require 'VATS jump'.
---
Easy to reproduce:
---
\- Equip melee weapon, target bloodbug, watch it spit on your face while your chance to hit remains at 0%.
---
\- Walk up to bubble turret, target, stare, stare... staaaaare...
---
Users are reporting high miss rate with ranged weapon against flying bugs in VATS too. Personally I haven't experienced this, my 'sidearm' on my melee character is a shotgun - she used to be my boomstick but after patch 9 we call her Tickler - so I just aim in the general direction of the bugs rather than using VATS.
---
This is one of the many threads that have cropped up on the subject in the last couple of days; unfortunately none of them have gained any 'traction' that I can see:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmpoyk/melee\_bug\_with\_flying\_bugs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmpoyk/melee_bug_with_flying_bugs/)
---
It is an unfortunate coincidence that this bug has cropped up when the latest questline keeps throwing precisely these kind of... pests at us.
---
Or is it? (tinfoil time!) :P
---
Above the main white springs bunker entrance and around that area!
---
she (valseek) is one of the people who can help me ...tech support is just gonna give me the run around thinking I don't know how to start the quest right.
---
Yep. I was getting super mad and ended up getting the parts three times before I realized that it was my screw up causing the issue lol.
---
That's amazing
---
i would more think '25% increased reload and swing speed' and '+20 carry weight' but something like '-25% accuracy with guns' or 'stagger more'
---
I thought it was just me.
---
only if it's only Exterminator.
---
Thank you :) im gonna be selling my AA at my shop so it can have a new home.
---
Its psychological thing, not practical. You feel complete when all your useless stuff can help
---
Never have they stated we would get to choose what we got out of the Pervayer.
---
No. Backpacks are destroyed if you try to drop it. Haven’t tried putting one in the vending machine yet tho
---
Pretty sure this was a joke but someone try to sell dirty water for 25k lol
---
See I tried that and it didn't seem like it was doing any damage. I'll give it another go next time I play.
---
Can't trade them. Trust me I tried to send them...
---
oooooooooooh BRENDA!!
---
I’d say high. The observatory is a place that just screamed future content when I first explored it
---
If you are on PS4 I’ll buy it for u at whitesprings station.
---
If you have a couple of them and you don't explicitly know it's high value, I'd either sell it dirt cheap or not at all.
---
Personally, not at all. I'd rather feed bulk junk and aid stuff
---
Yes. I mean I did it forever ago during the BOS quest, I think? Whenever I was doing Fort Defiance the first time. But I've never had it pop in Watoga before, and it seems like a bug or something. Probably like 600 in game hours ago, it's all kinda fuzzy back then lol.
---
yes they may have unintentionally done it but they said a "reroll" of our items  specifically
---
Would’ve been funnier if he’d hustled out of the water and built a floor over it before you landed.
---
Alright add me up and I’ll be happy to help with anything
---
In the ash heap the event breach and clear gives lots of ores
---
i would say near a common farming spot
---
I just went to the encryptid event and waited for someone to be downed in the pond in the middle of the fight. Reviving them got me both the swimming challenge and basic revive task.
---
you have to use the new pro sanp camera
---
It doesn't have to break just be worn. Also if you are making one make sure you make the lowest tier so it's durability is less.
---
5 events and nada. I got s'mores I guess. I'm a possum scout so it's not even that.
---
I hope the purveyor is kinder.
---
I just love the fact you actually have a chance of retrieving the bolts from your kill.  The more you know!
---
Ok let me rephrase that because my blunt message lost context.
---
Who wants to recycle over ten 3 star legendares to create low level legendaries with their low level alt.
---
I'm betting nobody wants to. Do you think someone wants to?
---
Ah I see. Well thank you anyway!
---
I have three industrial water purifiers at my camp. I let them run and then sell the water to vendors.
---
There's probably faster methods, but this is reliable and low effort.
---
A reddit poster said yesterday that they had seen an intelligence bobblehead priced at 25k, it was the only item in the machine and the message on the vending machine spelled out something like “if you buy this you need it” 😂😂😂
---
Yeah that problem has been there since the Beta.
---
And make sure the name of the attraction appears in the camera screen top right hand corner
---
Thanks for the info. 🙂
---
That's the one. 
---
Plus, you know, do a clear of west tek and sell the rifles. That's a good run too...600+ caps with decent charisma and hard bargain perk.
---
1. green thumb is a must have then go to billings farm there is a corn crop and just down the road a huge crop of razorgrain you can get 500 or so caps by selling that, 
---
2. sell weaps and armor dont scrap them 
---
3. sell all non used meds / food
---
dun
---
Biv is an interactive NPC. As a matter of fact all the dead people are NPCs, the dead members of the BoS, the Overseer, the members of the free states that left behind missions for us. These are all non player characters.
---
The creature does not have to be alive. The pictures count even if it’s a pic of the corpse. As long as the viewfinder registers the creature’s name.
---
Unfortunately someone keeps shooting them.
---
That is true as well
---
This is brought up every twenty minutes it should have been in patch notes but I heard its bugged rn. You can only inspect if the owner of the camp is present, otherwise take your risk. Btw what platform are you on?
---
I’ve heard you can if the player/vendor is nearby, you cannot if they’re far away... hope they fix this.
---
Only YOU can re-poop America.
---
The Brahmin was obviously in on it.
---
great idea, love it
---
finally legendary bone club and scout armor
---
If I'm on, I'll drop by for sure.
---
I've seen some people selling some junk legendaries for 25k caps. Completely forgetting anyone who fast travels to their cap isn't ever even going to have 25k caps.
---
It doesn’t necessarily mean Nuclear Winter is entirely based on battle-royale. Vault 51 may be one of the vaults opening in the future, and it may not be part of Nuclear Winter.
---
Okay, but my point is, having worked in tech support, knowing someone who can help is good. Having a paper trail that is linked to your account and has the information in it that other teams can also read is better. (especially with dates and times that get updated every time someone does any action, even just reading the ticket.)
---
Also asking someone else to do all the work for you is often less effective than starting the standard procedure and then getting someone to escalate and run with it. Valseek could be on holiday or sick, and by having the official ticket and ticket number others may be able to help sooner.
---
Not only that, your account name isn't listed here in this thread. Im not asking for it or anything, but it looks like you are expecting her to read through your post history to find details to be able to even log the job in the first place, let alone begin the investigation.
---
Every error I have seen logged here on Reddit, has had the bethesda employee ask what the ticket number is so they can follow up on what is happening.
---
Next time I get it at least I'll know what's going on, even if half the people in this thread think I'm an idiot for not knowing it was the same quest as the F. Defiance one xD
---
So much this!!!
---
Yes! I just restarted and it’s extremely enjoyable! Far more enjoyable than my first time. You know what to do, you can build your character from the start better, and you just know how to handle the game. They’ve also added in a significant amount of quests and stuff to the game, and much more to come.
---
Yea. I just spent a decent amount of time writing this up so I hope it helps people
---
No, but it was stated the we would be able to customize our gear. Not buy random stuff.
---
I'd love a text chat on the pip boy.
---
Any indication on how they are 'weighted'?
---
I mean if she is clearly biased towards 'finding' nocturnal rolling pins and hunter's wood armour in her 'stash'.
---
Considering they have a perk about night vision when sneaking the darkness level is pitiful.
---
To be honest, I can't tell the difference between night and day in game without looking directly up. The means I never know when the night quest is happening. and had been thinking my solar powered radiation recovery was buggy, hadn't occurred to me that it was actually night till i did the story by the camp fire and realized it was actually night.
---
Fab idea....
---
We were going to play Russian Roulette with my punchbowl.
---
Was gonna fill it full.of mixed drinks with one Nukashine. Then everyone was gonna have a drink and we wait and see lol....
---
Buying and selling with players works pretty well if you're good at it
---
yea I get you and I may do this but i have delt with their tech support before and it sucks so bad ...but If it's what I have to do to get my game working right then I guess I have no choice
---
Ive been looking for a resource spot. Mainly oil, junk or lead that I can camp at. Ive seen a bunch of merchants near whitesprings, the overseers camp and on the border of cranberry near site bravo. I've been looking for a resource/camp/ plan farm camp since I moved. South of the top of the world trainstaion is great. Theres concrete and quite a few mods and plans spawning in the area as well as raider pa, oh and two vendors. I thi k i may move back actually.
---
Text chat on console games is doable.  I've played certain games on console that offered text chat despite being incredibly inconvenient to actually utilize with a controller.   Though, you could plug in a USB keyboard to speed up things.  Perhaps the same could apply to modern consoles.
---
Either way, to some degree, the PC version is already different and has certain functions that are exclusive to it.  So, if text chat was an exclusive thing for PC, it probably wouldn't be that much of a unique feature.
---
I'm not sure how true it is, but I remember reading one of the speculated reasons that we might not have text chat yet is because if Bethesda did add it, they'd have to add text-to-chat functionality because of some new laws to provide disabled gamers better access.
---
Same.
---
Instigating crossbows are amazing, especially when you're feeling ammo starved.
---
I named mine, "Retired Adventurer," from the glaringly obvious Skyrim quote. 
---
~arrow to the knee~
---
Honestly we failed badly. But I’m keen to try again when you’re ready? We should try get an army going before launching the nuke however
---
Same here, I can have a bug right in front of my nose and it's anyone's guess if I can hit it, you might as well forget vats targeting because it won't even let you attack 75-80% of the time, even at point blank range.
---
Is it just me or do they also fly at different heights now too?
---
Nice
---
Thought they disabled punch bowls for now, did they not?
---
This
---
How much ultracite 308 is made when you craft it? Im looking for prime lmg reicever and would like know so i can get more or less flux for it
---
Nope it's all an even chance as far as i can tell so far.
---
Also id like to know if certain legendaries and weapons have an equal chance as others.
---
Awesome! Just stepped out of the vault for the first time since last year. Wish me luck
---
Not an option on PC, unfortunately.
---
[This](https://imgur.com/a/g0eq7Ox) one or there is even more new now?
---
yeah that one
---
I tried different angles and as far as I understood the photo must contain the poster with the name of attraction.
---
Might be when "winter" arrives, but the Granny's Tea recipe is just the thing for summer scout camp
---
They do, just like in the bucket list quest. But challenge is not completing
---
I've been following any and all info regarding the Legendary vendor, and I've not once heard of them saying we would get to pick what we want.
---
we still don't use point or commas if it's unnecessary (like this case)
---
Here is a list of all weapons armor droppable from the legendary vendor! 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmv494/datamined_list_of_all_weapons_and_armor/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
It does definitely encourage you to buy more if you don't have to walk back
---
I do that several times a day.
---
Still waiting on that legendary "Todd's" prefix
---
So does anyone know if the drops will be your level or max level? I would assume whatever your current level is but haven't seen for sure
---
I understand people not wanting text but there has to be understanding for people that dont want to be forced to use headphones and a mic, too. I don't understand the attitude against people not wanting to use a mic. there are valid reasons.
---
some people may have health issues and the like that prevent them from hearing fully or at all ... and big shocker...they don't *want* the noise of getting on mic. they may or may not have social anxiety but 100% have a valid reason to NOT get on mic and they don't need to be shamed about it either. noise can be overwhelming for some especially after dealing with it and people all day and this is their chance to relax. or maybe every other time they got on voice in almost any other game they got harassed for being female.
---
there should be an option to actually communicate if we do choose to not mic up. and please something beyond the emotes.
---
But that's how economy works, if it doesn't sell then the vendor can reduce the price.
---
If people are daft enough to pay those prices then...
---
Caveat emptor
---
Any container placed in a camp is a stash box. They might have not used a standard one.
---
I like this as it is pretty hard to keep track
---
They have to think of stability. I'd rather have a more stable game than one that crashes and freezes all the time because people want a manor house full of clutter.
---
I understand the appeal, when I used to play morrowind I spent hours collecting things and decorating my home with the objects. For now you'll just have to downsize until they come up with a solution. I'd advise less turrets if you need to free up some budget space.
---
😊
---
Yes I've noticed that too, thought I was imagining it!  And in greater numbers too.  Used to be groups of 3 creatures, now groups of 5.
---
Yup, happens to me all the time. Never been able to figure out why.
---
And that is how I make my caps lol....
---
Selling serums to the poor souls who do that or accidentally Rad X. Bless em!
---
[deleted]
---
I know PS4 keeps copies in the game data file ...not sure about PC or Xbox
---
Definitely belongs in the mire though..
---
Ohh I had no idea. See im too new to be making these posts lol. I didn't know the games cloud storage for our inventory worked like that. Thought it was strictly the stash box.  
---
I'm not saying its not doable.  I'm saying they didn't do it because its built for consoles.
---
As for 'pc-specific functions' - which ones?  I'm not aware of any.
---
&gt;. . . they'd have to add text-to-chat functionality because of some new laws or something to provide disabled gamers better access.
---
If that were the case then every game with text chat would be offering text-to-voice translation.  They don't.  Because its not a law.
---
Tried this, still nor working. Switched to hunter badge for now.
---
I'm having the same problem. I pulled my garden / brahmin fences up to shift them a bit and now I can't replace them, even to their original position, on a relatively flat patch of ground. Nope, item is floating. Nope, item needs support. Rinse, repeat.   
---
The foundation fix is great though.
---
That's interesting, cause I've seen stashes in every camp I've ever been in...
---
Cap stashes - just remember where they are. Try to get the perk card for it asap.
---
You need to get the camera off the dead tourist to start that quest.
---
Are you using the camera from the tourist? I was an idiot and ran around in photo mode for about twenty minutes before I realized it wasn't what I was supposed to be using lol.
---
A reroll does not mean we get to have a say in what we get. If you thought it did then the dissapointment you are feeling is entirely due to your inability to manage your expectations.
---
Only scrap crap items &amp; then if you get something good then it's a win
---
If you get crap back, I think everyone would be a little pissed, but keep scrapping away, at least no one will complain about stash size
---
My daughter asks me to stand at the edge of nuke zones so she can watch the explosions lol. Awesome pic!
---
I wish we could do all the melee moves like the leg sweep ect
---
F
---
Ah okay so I’m not the only one. 
---
Go go crippled gang!
---
i have a few for sale, xbox1 and it has a discount on it. 
---
you can also find them on the wild and good luck hunting!!!!!1
---
I'm just glad I got a clip of it for future reference.
---
There's different chat settings, such as /p for party chat or /l for local. You can entirely disable the global or trade chats or any, all using /help to find such commands.
---
I too found out late. Is the limit of 30 object for player or for machine?
---
you can find unstable flux in nuke zones but you still need to craft them to stable flux before they are usefull
---
I've literally never heard any of this since day one, thank god. What a mess that launch in beta was. Turned area voice chat back on 3 or so months after launch and everything is swell.
---
Splendid news. Thanks!
---
Yep; sold 148 scrips worth. Twice so far.
---
Patch 9's wording indicates there is a per-item based chance for generic legendary drops:
---
&gt; **Loot:** The legendary drop rates for the Gatling Gun and Cryolater have been adjusted to better match all other weapons. 
---
We've been suspecting the non-uniform drop chances and also suspecting some preferentiality based on items picked up recently, items held in inventory or stash and/or server seed, because different people with different weapon preferences were reportedly getting biased drops.
---
This is only a guess, but if Beth is reusing the same loot drop selection mechanism, we should see preferential drops over a course of 100-200 items obtained from the Purveyor.
---
If the chances are independent and uniform, getting a 1\* Handmade would be 1:50 or 1250 Scrip. That's 417 Wood Left Leg turned in over 9 days, 48 WLL/day. If you farm Whitesprings 8 hours a day, you'll get 50 items on average. A 1\* Handmade this way is 1:200 uniform and 1:100 preferential -&gt; 4 days/2 days of farming. Now a 2:1:1 split and 1\* drops, you can get 50/2 \* 3 + 50/2 \* 5 = 75 + 125 = 200 Scrip worth of loot a day. 3 days looting and 4 days for letting Scrip restock.
---
https://za.ign.com/m/fallout-5-ps4/130932/news/fallout-76-update-aims-to-solve-a-big-endgame-problem Howard explained that the new Legendary Vendor will offer a system where players can cash in their unwanted legendaries in exchange for tokens, which can then be used to "somewhat customize and roll for the legendary that you want." 
---
I was confused at first, then I read the context.. giggled
---
I found one for 20 caps in someone's vending machine. It goes well with my sequin dress.
---
My idea was. Everyone gets naked, you get a 10mm pistol and 50 rounds. Don’t look at the map, try to find your way back to camp........
---
ULPT: place a decontamination shower always on at the entrance of your CAMP and then sell serums
---
Yes - they no longer shoot back
---
ok so ironically enough, you \*are\* able to text chat to your console friends, using the console chats themselves. However, on PC there is no possible way to communicate with a friend if they are offline, not in your party or not directly within area chat range. Unless you have the text chat mod or a forum details to message them.
---
I have friends that I haven't played with for months and there's no way to know if they have abandoned or I am just unlucky with being on at the same time.
---
I could use help with the same thing. If you’re on I’ll join you shortly. GT is Tapewyrm0
---
Haven't they already increased it twice. People keep asking for more stash size and budget for building. I remember something called inventory management. 😂
---
The hardest way is to craft them from materials in a nuke zone, but the safest. 
---
The fastest way is to join the event: Scorched Earth. When you successfully help to kill the Queen you get some as a reward. 
---
Finally, too can just buy them from player vendors for 100-250 per material.
---
i have the same on pc, sometimes even when standing still for a bit
---
With player vending, you may find folks selling them at their camps. Just look for folks selling junk.
---
Yeah, 
---
, = Decimal Seperator
---
. = the other one for me (thousands seperator?)
---
So to me he means 25 000 Caps
---
That and they spawn in a pack from time to time....
---
no a reroll meant i should get to reroll one of the slots kinda like how diablo 3 does it
---
It's worth a try... Are you in the wrong channel, and do you have push to talk enabled. Have you rebound that key?
---
Next time it happens check the ground around you and see if you stepped on a punji board or bear trap, they are scattered all over Appalachia.
---
Yeah i had to get pretty close to it.
---
having worked for large companies, any tech support call that doesn't come through regular channels and doesn't have a ticket number is untracked, and untracked work is lowest priority, as working on it takes time away from official duties that managers keep watch over.
---
systems like bethesda has setup has employees working with contractual obligations of must work on x number of tickets a day, or to resolve within x amount of time.
---
I have seen an issue like yours go on for literally over 9 months before the client actually logged an official ticket, at which point it was covered under a service level agreement and had to be fixed within 10 business days. (and it was)
---
But yes, I have had to use the support system before... and sucks so bad is an understatement. but your issue would be deeper than client side, so hopefully it gets escalated to someone who knows the insides of the system that isn't working.
---
The only thing worse than a terrible support system is not being in the ticket system at all, which is like being in purgatory, never knowing if anything is happening, or if it will ever happen.
---
Be a squeaky wheel where people who it affects can hear it.
---
While I like the thought of you just getting someone to help, companies that rely on multiple departments working together with different goals, teams, budgets and schedules, need to have some way of being held accountable.
---
I liked the old days of customer happiness being priority. But this is a day and age of statistics and charts.
---
Good luck, and I hope you get help. I'm not trying to badger you but, as I mentioned above, I did see someone in a similar situation to you and they wouldn't fill in a form that only they could legally fill out, and without the magic reference number and the clock of doom counting down, everything else had priority.
---
I know. I've used them &amp; that still was the impression after.
---
I'm not against text chat in game if that wasn't clear. Just saying implementation matters &amp; I'd rather not have something similar to the mod.
---
I just tell them to do thumbs up for yes and down for no. It's simple enough
---
Howard explained that the new Legendary Vendor will offer a system where players can cash in their unwanted legendaries in exchange for tokens, which can then be used to "somewhat customize and roll for the legendary that you want." The higher the star rating on a scrapped legendary, the higher the chance that the vendor will supply the loot a player hopes for.
---
Again if you thought this ment we would get to pick, then you still only have yourself to blame. Even on the off chance they intended for us to pick what we want then are you surprised that they went back on their word.
---
ty i couldnt find the link for this
---
Or if they think larger bases will put too much of a strain on he servers, let us build multiple bases.
---
It might just be a bit further down on their to-do-list. IMO i think we've gotten some pretty great patches lately.
---
Ya? Any confirmation on that, or somewhere I can see the full list? I really wanna check for what is new and unattainable in the normal pools
---
I have a Toad Eye listed at 15,000
---
Using the barging perk card will easily decrease that if u can get a 2 or 3 star version
---
I bought those plans for like 950 caps I think with the 2 star bargin perk card
---
I just converted my alien blaster to use fusion cells, and made it automatic. It's now a super weak laserbullet hose.
---
Yeah I agree, if it currently takes up 3 points as it is, we should be able to slot something else in its place and if we have 3 PER then can unlock lvl 3 locks, same with intelligence and hacking. There are so many dumb and useless perks in the game, kind of like there are a few mutations that shouldn't be in the game but they do it anyways. You should be utilizing perk cards to better the game and playstyles, not control how many rads you take when you eat un-cooked meat or drink un-purified water. Which, granted when you start out you can't build water purifiers right away, but the less rads from food and drink shouldn't be there.
---
Just out of curiosity, what do you think the word "customize" for means.
---
where is the "customize" in the way it is now genius?
---
Overwatch pc has text chat
---
Here you go!
---
Oh please, several games support a text chat on console, and it works just fine, and for a very lounge like game like Fallout 76, it works even better. Warframe has several chat channels on console, and the trade channel is updated about every second with a new message, so people are clearly able to type plenty fast enough (granted there is prediction based typing for ps4, so typing the same thing is even quicker). It should be easy enough to have a world chat, friends chat, custom chat, and then a team chat. Fortnite Save the World (not referring to the BR one that's infinitely more popular), has several chat channels, and people type just fine on console. Sure it's not as fast as a keyboard by a longshot, but it's not at all so slow that you would feel rather not bother using it. Spamming the hell out of the d-pad and x isn't difficult or super time consuming by any means. Like "Does anyone have a bloodied handmade for sale?" can take about 30 seconds to type, and I'm probably a bit faster than most people with a controller. For a very relaxed game like Fallout 76, taking a tiny bit of time to type doesn't impact anything negatively, but for a game like Overwatch though (which doesn't have text chat on console, or at least when I played), the much faster paced nature of that game would be very negatively impacted by a text chat on consoles.
---
yea I don't think the other guy gets it but yes i took it as a reroll myself from the word "customize" lol
---
So you cant even pass the note for someone? Thats a bummer. Do you happen to know anything about the random spawn vendor bot at Charleston or the place north of 76? Im curious if you server hop and get them again if they'll display other things or if its just a daily pool. Ive got cookoo clocks if ya want em lol.
---
It was meant to be fixed in last patch as a glitch was preventing it from being repeatable but it obviously hasn't been fixed properly. I had it start yesterday on a char that's not finished the BOS line so had no access to the pssword.
---
It's not exactly laziness after you don't bother doing it after 200+ times anymore...
---
I know what the word customize means, I also understand that there is no way a looter shooter Esq game is just gonna give you what you want that easily.
---
Yeah, and you can do the same with PC - its just that consoles are restricted to a single text app and everyone has it.  The PC community is divided.
---
But FO76 IS A CONSOLE GAME - with all that that means.  Including the assumption that every platform has a built in text app that everyone on that platform is using so they won't devote resources to making one only for the PC.  
---
Couple that with their vision of everyone just talking to each other 'to make the world seem alive' (hence the lack of PTT at release) and you see why they didn't make it and have no intention of doing so.
---
Same on Xbox too mate, usually get it when I first load in and then each subsequent visit to a new area or map cell. Some days it's worse than others
---
diablo 3 does this just fine and is what i expected this to be from they way they worded it
---
&gt;Oh please, several games support a text chat on console, and it works just fine,
---
WTF?  When did I say that text chat on consoles was impossible?
---
Is it me being dumb or this thing is only valid is you don't care what item you get?
---
If i want a very specific weapon, it makes more sense to me to buy the 100scrip one...
---
Why didn't border control shot her down? Does she have pass?
---
Good for Overwatch.  Now, tell Bethesda that because its not relevant to the point I made.
---
*BETHESDA DID NOT SEE THE NEED TO REMAKE THE WHEEL SINCE CONSOLES ALREADY HAVE BUILT IN TEXT CHAT AND THEY WON'T MAKE A SPECIAL VERSION OF THE GAME FOR PC.*
---
You mean east?
---
Yeah I definitely will when I get on, I am in desperate need of new gear.
---
I got the explosive one if anyone wants to buy it off me
---
give me mods for spears and crossbows too pls. Just more mods for weapons in general.
---
Also I've had it happen where it will show the player icon below my camp, so I don't realize there is another player there until I go to select my camp for fast travel and I click a dudes name instead 😂
---
Awesome. Thank you so much for this! Keep up the great work. I just realized how many melee weapons and armor pieces there are haha.
---
Can I help as well
---
What easily. I never asked to be able to make a God roll items at will. But to only have the choice between a melee weapon, a ranged weapon or a piece of armor is not customizing anything. It's still 100% random how is that customized?
---
Customize:
---
transitive verb
---
: to build, fit, or alter according to individual specifications. 
---
Seen em at Watoga and harpers ferry not as often anymore since last week but worth a try
---
I was home whole day for two days. First i did 3 possum challenge. Second i got 12 possum badges from grinding that event all day.
---
I know, I'm tired of having to constantly swap out my card for my sales, then fast travel, then hacking, then picking, then crafting.
---
I came here looking for an answer to this question too. Thank you all who've answered.  What confused me is that several of the other quests send you to far flung locations around the map hunt up north for bug parts, go to camp venture for a fitness test and there are several locations scattered around the map that have target practice areas so I thought that it may have been like the other quests
---
I’m on same server
---
Not the mods, the base armor plans themselves?
---
So apparently Instigating Tesla Shotgun does NOT count as a shotgun for killing a Yao Guai for the Hunter Badge
---
Just by trading in and picking something it’s already a custom pick if you ask me buddy
---
My bet is, the rest of the world is in nuclear winter. ATLAS has been keeping things relatively nice for the past few years. But something breaks, and West Virginia soon slips into the rest of the man-made ice age.
---
My hope, is that this drives the scorch beasts under ground, but invites new types of enemies.
---
Don't forget that some players are deaf.
---
50cal got a slight buff a few patches ago, there was a minor HW overhaul.
---
Look all I can say is if you thought you can have your way in a looter shooter Esq game then that's your fault.
---
Thats cool and all but what is the big woop?
---
It's a glitch in the Matrix.
---
Looking at you gt chickenmobileNZ you want to go swim
---
Thanks man . Ill let y know too if found a way to fix this
---
Who let Kevin Costner buy Fallout?
---
Well done!  Your work is appreciated!
---
UPDATE: I didn't have plans for antibiotics so I went garage sale hunting and found a player vendor who had it
---
Yeah but they're not scattered all over porches at whitespring, which is where I usually am when it's happening.
---
Or when you foot slog it to a CAMP, only for it to de-rez in the last 100 meters.
---
3 Times last night. FFS
---
Yes. I keep 20, 30, and 40 in stock as well as 50. I think I've only sold one lower level, but that lvl 50 goes quick.
---
Shoot crossbow bolt into wall.
---
Stand on bolt.
---
Holotype second is west from the radio tower next to flat woods.  
---
In same box as first one.
---
First holotape is lines 1-10 from your leak
---
Second is lines 11-17.
---
So next thing will be north of second holotape.
---
\+karma
---
Legendary shovel???? Oh my god another drill?
---
ther was a way before pach all you needed is 8 steal 6 aluminium  per kill and you get 400 xp per kill , ammunition factory killing and repering Viterbirds (hellicopters)  that was fastest way cinda VIP  befouse you hawe to pay to lvl :) but now is all fixed so no point :) all this was wery mach kept quiet :)
---
I order a supply drop and take a photo of that one. I think you can do it with the collision course event as well but haven’t tested it.
---
Difference is that shovel has legendary attach points while the drill does not! Meaning we will get a shovel with real legendary stats
---
Feel ya. 
---
Today is one of those days... ha
---
I add the hardened receiver and a swift magazine to the Fixer. And the disease cure sells quick also. For the disease cure, the default value is 0, so I only charge a few caps but they buy it then I run up and down the creek collecting bloodleaf, snap tail reed and firecaps to make more.
---
😂😂 I love it!
---
Thank you so much we used a grenade on us :-)
---
#DeadGame
---
I have just been putting it down to my character being an alcoholic and permanently drunk.
---
Harpoon gun too, even easier if you use the flechette mod.
---
Yet people don't see that selling something so cheap that another player can buy it from you, sell it to the in game vendor for twice the price, bring 90% of the caps BACK in to the game as a bad thing.....
---
Happens on pc as well. I monitor my cpu usage whilst playing the game. When the game stutters, the cpu goes to 100% for a few seconds, all cores and ram, massive spike. Don't know why.
---
fallout games are grind games with quest to do, its up to you to make it something else. but whatever you do, you will always have to grind. 
---
this type off games are for longevity game play not your normal f076 game.
---
One is at whitespring station
---
... You do realize we only have legendary scripping machines for now? And they are in same locations as on xbox?
---
Would be kinda funny if we found out someone has been lurking around us all the time, placing traps and blowing paper balls out of a straw to stagger us haha
---
I occasionally enjoy perching on the balcony railings on the front of the main Whitesprings building... like to think of my Blackbird X-01 as a giant, bored mechanical crow of death.
---
I see now.
---
Makes totally sense
---
How can i order a supply drop?
---
&gt;My guess is that you get a 3* random item
---
Why do you think this?
---
What if sometimes you get a 1 or 2 star item?
---
I don't even have an adblocker and some websites still tell me that.
---
There is a skill 1 on 3rd floor of Fort defiance  and a skill 2 on 4th floor.
---
"But ima raider's roleplay. I don't spell stuff good, I just hackslash stuff. I don't shower or read good".
---
Did something like this with a friend. Went to his camp, we drank Nukashine and went blind through our apparel and wore whatever we came up with. Wherever we spawned we picked a halfway point between us and walked there with no armour. It was fun. We took photos.

Hmm interesting...
---
Good information!
---
They are located at every station. How long do you wait around? Most of the time it takes a while for game to actually load them.
---
Facing out from the overseers camp, there is a covered bridge. Cross the bridge then turn left and follow the edge of the water, you will encounter a flat area near a large tree (about 30 feet from bridge). This is a critter spawn site. It will spawn Beavers, Squirrels, Radstags, Cats, Chickens, and Foxes.  
---
I had my camp there for a little while and every time I logged in, something needed exterminating.
---
look around the camp im 10000000000% sure you will find a stash, and not just  one chances are you are going to see few stash boxes. I know for a fact I got like 8 or more all around my camp.
---
Awesome! Thank you!
---
Yup, I've had it happen a few times. I just RP that mu character is super climsy and keeps tripping on things.
---
This is dumb. So dumb. Gaming journalism is by and large a joke, save for a few exceptions. WoW has used this in the auction house for what, 15 years now?
---
But it’s a problem because Bethesda did it. Ugh.
---
Ironically I was rebuilding my camp and someone spawned underneath in the farm with the doors locked.
---
They had to do the 'help me' emoji for me to let them out
---
That’s one optimistic way to look at it ha ha.
---
Keep up drinking! 😆🍻
---
Bought a key from cdkeys with only $11 . I paid full price for the game back in October but i needed a second account to deposit my caps and do the challenges/quests .
---
You need more upvotes bro!
---
How they do their RNG'ed calculation, nobody but the devs know for sure. As you say, for 2 and 3 star weapons or armor, there are so many combinations, and yet we see a disproportionate amount of better rolls than hopeless ones. There are loot tables for all legendary drops (or so we are lead to believe). There seems to be a bias towards weapons or armor with certain effects (eg. unyielding on armor) and this may be due to factors such as the server, area on the map, enemy type etc. If there is no bias then how is it possible to get more than 1 3-star assassin/cavalier or unyielding/sentinel armor piece even once in 150 3-star drops. I had 3 pieces in total so far, but less than 150 3-star drops (I know because I've kept most of them on my spare characters). What I'm saying is that there should be more of an even spread (distribution) throughout the different effects and in general I don't see that.
---
What set of rules the Purveyor will use for each of the several categories of weapons and armor is unknown as there is no specific map area, enemy type, just the server and your level.
---
Good bot
---
Yessir
---
I did the camp tales 8 times and no badge for it. Really unlucky there :(
---
yes and nope. i travelled where xbox players found machines and they werent there. no need to snappy
---
ive been around for more than 5 minutes on any station...yet havent found any of the machines :(
---
Wait what plus str on a gun????
---
One time I got the two mixed up at a party and the host was NOT excited about it.
---
Destroy it then take the picture
---
I'm on PC and have used the machine at whitespring station. It's otside against the wall of the building on the rail platform.
---
I make 5000 a day in 3-4 hours
---
It doesnt work. I did it and it convert into the box
---
i think you can only complete it once and only get one weapon, you would be best waiting till level 50 to complete it. you might be able to buy level 50 one from a players camp if you don't level up in time
---
Sadly cant come to visit as on PS4 but take an upvote since your pictures have given me an idea.
---
I've been really struggling with trying to build my camp Tibb's N' Chips as I've been building a two story building, with the farm below and the shop and benches above.
---
Every keeps spawning inside the farm below :( So looking at your build, I think I will move in your direction with two different buildings to stop this happening :)
---
I got a pioneer scout paint plan for a knife "forget which type" at the other daily with the rad waste cleanup.
---
I've used the one at Sutton alot.
---
Ah sorry, the camera can be really dodgy at times. Needed a picture of a rabbit to complete this weeks weekly challenge and I had to pin it in a corner and practically stand on top of it until it finally registered.
---
Sometimes it's like the server didn't realize you placed something, and you might have to relog?
---
That really is so American
---
 “Yeah, we have knives, but it’s missing something... can we shoot it?”
---
“Make it happen.”
---
Apparently the CMs have acknoweldged this on another thread so looks like it is a glitch.
---
Thank you! I'm just tired of all the damn flapping and shrieking those cancer bats make. I'm also sick of them rolling two SB's deep, doing wasteland drive-by's and leveling my freaking camp. They literally fly up, destroy my camp, then fly away. Whoever invented them.... uuuugh you need to make it up to us with a better boss tier enemy.
---
I Had to build under a bridge down by the river just to escape them... even then they might still find me!
---
the collision course event at morgan town airport is easiest as the cargobot lands for a few seconds right in front you
---
“No, wait.  Still not a knife.”
---
just been there.....theres is none :/
---
My question is how to NOT have more than 2500? Just by completing events/quests i get a lot of caps and also from killing supermutants.
---
If you're on PC my dude just hit H to heal! 😊
---
Always hoping for a instigating hunting rifle to start with.
---
I'm a simple man lol
---
Ok, thanks
---
I'm actually a bit confused about this one? Do they need to be like completely underwater or something like ankle deep?
---
Oh cool, thank you very much for getting this informations to us kind sir!
---
I had a friggen legendary mole rat do that, nearly killed me, first from the explosion and then from laughter.
---
Well the white textures in toxic valley is from a factory i think that blew and the toxic chemicals that came down from the result of the explosion. 
---
I did see those textures you mention after thinking about it now, so yeah maybe? Would be cool though if they were adding something like that.
---
theres no machine aswell just been there......i see where the machine should spawn but it just doesnt
---
I don't play on PC but perhaps you have a mod that is causing the issue? I know people on PC having no problem at all.
---
This happened to me. She had a slither of health left and decided to fly away past the map border. She came back 2 mins before the end of event with full health.
---
looks like this is a PC bug......no matter what station the machine is not spawning. do i need to meet certain requierements or smth? im really gettin pissed now...been collectin legendaries for days :(
---
If you have one of those “us government supply acquisition” holotapes just plug that in to the terminal at any radio tower. 👍🏼
---
Maybe it’s just an actual (albeit extra-psychotic) Mr. Gutsy wearing a flayed Mole Miner as a suit.
---
There is maybe its not loaded in yet
---
I think in water but not submerged, not sure though.
---
You see Bethesda! This is exactly why we need C.A.M.P spawn points, to stop people spawning behind my locked doors and shitting on my bed!
---
Also, as long as it's not a meat pile, DEAD things count.
---
Should be fun, but I do wish they would add in a legendary alien blaster.
---
Interesting concept, I honestly didn't even consider that. I previously dismissed the defense rating as a remnant from when they were given the code to Fallout 4 and told here...make this work online. I generally use the least about of turrets possible due to my overbearing need to decorate but if it saves poor Bessie from dying for the 50th time...
---
I lock my doors because I don't want people shitting on my bed.
---
Do you mean rotating a structure so it is outside of the boundaries, or moving the CAMP object to change your boundaries?
---
From my experience, you can only change the boundaries by physically moving and placing the CAMP at a new location (even if it is only a couple feet away). And unless it is something you're about to place as a blueprint, you can't rotate an entire structure (and I haven't had a blueprinted structure that I could place yet, but maybe the new foundation change fixed this?) I've had to take every bit of wall and foundation and furniture etc. of mine and store it to move a structure back a couple meters when some of my later additions like stairs couldn't be placed due to the boundaries of the CAMP build area.
---
I am joining you in search!
---
Nice one lol
---
But then wouldn't we understand anything they want to tell us because of the gibberish?
---
Are you on PC or consoles
---
Just wait until you have ghouls that explode on death.
---
Has been happening to me since launch, but maybe it's a glitch caused by bird bones or goat legs, like a delayed stagger or something. 
---
At first I thought it was someone sniping me, and I'd spam vats like mad trying to find the culprit lol.
---
to craft 1 stable flux you would need 10 unstable flux (all the same type of flux, green thumb helps with this) 1 high radiation fuilds, 1 hardened mass and 1 glowing mass and then use the chemistry station's nuke florna section to craft it (if you have super duper equipped you have a chance at getting an extra one), all unstable flux has a condition bar so will turn into inert flux after a few minutes (good with salt seems to slow it down)
---
Hold please. I can just buy a pack without doing all the quests everyone's complaining about? I was not looking forward to several hours of menial tasks. Do you have any details about carry weight? Or is it just cosmetic?
---
I don't want to role play as a person who can carry slightly more stuff.
---
So none of the legendary PA pieces everyone thought were coming then,huh?
---
No you can't. You need to get the first backpack in game to craft the Atom Shop ones.
---
Not looking to change the boundaries. Let's say you move camps and set down your blueprinted structure but you didn't get it quite right. There's no way to select the whole structure again and rotate it or move it?
---
You cant craft/equip the atom store before you unlock thw quest backpack
---
Yes. 
---
So just pretend that you hit your toe on a stone. What a pain.
---
You cant craft/equip the atom store before you unlock the quest backpack
---
You can't. You need the in game backpack to craft the Atom Shop ones.
---
Surely they'll scale.
---
Surely...
---
It was announced that there is one at every train station.  If there is none it's because you have a bug.  try updating or reinstalling the game to fix it.
---
xbone. is the marine armor helmet not spawning on PC?
---
Maybe you just have a shitty internet connection or computer.
---
I do have a mic.  It's just nice to sit in silence sometimes if I don't have enough to say to warrant breaking that silence.  Text chat is a blessing.
---
No you can't but at level 50 crafting it gives you +60 carry weight
---
But my other character that hasn't done the quest can't craft it even though it shows up at the work bench
---
Fine. I had a good 2 minutes of happiness there.
---
ye i will do that now :)
---
&gt; gimmie 75 characters and id be stoked...
---
Make it 76
---
I've got one it's right inside. Had to move my vending outside since it seemed people were having trouble with my coded door, even though the code is right next to it. (don't want my door left open). But just explore the camp. 100% sure that all camps will have a stash. No clue why you wouldn't build one
---
i got a high-end rig and a more than good connection so thats definitely not the problem.
---
I believe it was on pc first I'm on xbox that why I was asking
---
Are the weapons levelled? Is it better to wait to 50 to get or can they scale up like mysteries weapons?
---
A friend and I went to New Gad, I stood in the water and let the Super Mutants almost kill me and then my friend revived me.
---
I have an issue on pc where no matter what  type or where I play the instruments they aren’t being counted... rip
---
This is pretty good, its be nice if they could implement even a fraction of this.
---
One thing to mention though, A Roboto *is* A NPC
---
Also the opposite direction on top of the hill works often
---
Nope. The post that found files with the name like "sell_pa" under curve tables is for future proofing in case they do add them
---
Now I get it. Now I get that crippling disappointment.
---
i just have the ratmonkeys ez sorting and icon taggin...havent foudn any reports that this might cause vending machines to disappear
---
Either order a supply drop or do collision course at Morgantown airport. They should hover long enough for you to take the photo.
---
There's an increased capacity mod that gives 120 carry weight.
---
Question: Have you been using addons and if so, did you update your ini file for patch 9 file names?  
---
I would do a scan and repair under game options just in case. It seems odd that your issue is so isolated and consistent yet vast majority of players have experienced no issues with seeing the machines.
---
It's happened forever. Dont really know why, but I always just put it down to me stubbing my toes on the uneven ground!
---
To be fair I think nuclear winter would only last about 2 years after that most of the planet would recover pretty quickly. And considering this is 25 years after the bombs, it's seems reasonable that it would look the way it does.
---
Yeah I've only just completed phase one of the grind ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
---
By now all my toes must be broken
---
I've server hopped at Lady Janet's north of 76 to get the Hunter's Long Coat.  Each time I hopped and got the vendor bot, he had different clothes - I wasn't looking for weapons/armour/plans so I didn't notice if they changed or not.  Took quite a while, and I'm not sure if it's a daily pool or not sorry.
---
I never said it didn't, but to say this works (typos included) is akin to strapping a megaphone to your dog and calling it an alarm. Sure it'll get the job done but there is always a more elegant solution.

I just believe that if someone took the time to make a tool, they should take the extra hour to polish it. For example, if the creator made a separate tab for each quiz they could have saved over 250 lines of headers for the quizzes, and 750 line breaks (drastically shortening the vertical space each quiz takes up). thats 1,000 lines right there. Not to mention the filter options that could have been implemented in each tab so "Ctrl+F" wouldn't be needed; therein reducing search times to mere seconds rather than wondering why you can't find the question because the typo removed the spaces in line 1366, making  "Sauerkraut, pickles, beer, and yogurt" look like  "Sauerkrautpicklesbeerand yogurt" and almost impossible to find.  
---
but it's nice to know it works for you :)
---
Thank you so much! Don't know how I missed it!
---
I found this in another post:
---
There is a Select Entire Structure button, it will not select the entire camp, but it will select a building and everything that is connected to that building which makes blueprinting and entire build much quicker.
---
I haven't seen this before but I'll take a look for it later and let you know if it's not a thing.
---
Yes. I got it after the update. It was out front if white springs.
---
Only reason I went and got it was the tadpole challenges require it.
---
It's been 3 days now...
---
Oh well I submitted a ticket, will wait and see.
---
Damn, have an IE one if you were on XB1
---
It's just the typical binary thinking and stubborn mentality of online crowds. A game is labeled as GotY or trash at launch and it stays so. When a game attempts to change this state, the news get a little bit "extra" to keep the narrative about the game the same. Just a week (or two) ago one of the gaming websites (the big ones, like  Kotaku) published an article about Fo76 still having the passionate fanbase that loves the game and wants to keep it alive. Did it get attention? Did it appear on r/Games? Nope. Instead some wannabe online historian gets attention to his video where he yet again repeats the "fails" of Fo76. Now Bethesda releases the best patch (and best recieved patch) and noone outside r/Fo76 seems to give a shit. Well, some people give a shit - they got scared that the game can redeem itself and their  invested hate gets wasted. The narrative must apparently go on, so they latched onto the 10% as some big controversy. 
---
*Nononono. Don't pay attention to the "good" patch. Look here, they introduced 10% fee on ingame trading. Bethesda is worse then EA, amirite?*
---
\- Most of them currently
---
Wish I could help. But I recommend joining in on queen and imposter sheepsquach events. As someone always seems to go down in them.
---
Are there any sources on how long IRL nuclear winter would last? Assuming a full M.A.D. exchange? I know there are some nuclear winter deniers these days as well... (yup, probably the same people that deny climate change)
---
horrible timing on your part lmao.
---
Just team up with someone and then blow yourself up with a grenade they then will stimpack you got sorted with 2 other players if you stuck on now xb1 chickenmobileNZ
---
&gt;  it means that it was designed for console hardware and I/O. Which means 99.999999999999999999999999% of the players on console don't even have a keypad, let alone a keyboard.
---
Not explicitly, but you basically stated it was because of the absence of a keyboard that it would never happen, when in fact, a keyboard isn't explicitly necessary on consoles. No way in hell is every single person using a keyboard on console text chat. Ps4 even has it's own messaging system on its menu. A keyboard isn't remotely required to make it work well. The I/O isn't the issue, it's just wether or not they want to bother implementing one for Fallout 76. It's literally just text chat, but definitely a bit slower. Again, I/O has nothing to do with it.
---
I just hate that even if you take out all the adds the sbs still just fly around and look at you, refusing to land.
---
Why the Need for strength on a gun?
---
You clearly have no idea how the Creation Engine's animations work. There's a reason all expressions and movements look so stiff in the game.
---
As far as we can see we find a little commentary on the top left of the screen when we log in that says something about seasons, so it could be a very possible thing the change of seasons and enemies.  
---
IT would be great you just hype me so much, i hate(love) you :P
---
Yeah thats why im looking for it too.
---
And did you server hop for it or did you find by luck?
---
13k players have downloaded that mod. It's quite a large group of people to sink along with. Of course it might not have 13k current users.
---
I'm meeting the Level 80 Noxious legendary sheepsquatch all the time at the Investigator's cabin...
---
It's always while i'm crawling with 800+ pounds of crap from west tek to whitesprings. I had no idea that killing the damn thing solo is so impressive
---
do yourself a favor and do it in water so you get two things done at once.
---
But is it? They said the over repair bonus was a bug, so that means that the weapons were supposed to be useles? So they fixed a bug but now the fix is a glitch?
---
You can do it in the hut at the pioneer scout camp next to scout leader jaggy
---
I found two in containers
---
You can sometimes find the broken camera now in toolboxes since the latest patch. I have 4 now.
---
Well, I got in late, I didn't see anything super fancy. Nice to find cheap plans. The game has like a million of different plans and I got only half.
---
Ooh thanks dude
---
Making it basically the new Rolling Pin 🤣
---
Only after youve wound the first one
---
Or Chainsaw
---
The market subs only reflect prices of the wealthy traders in those subs. Most people youll meet in game will expect lower prices as theyre not actively trading and dont have the capital.
---
Moving inventory fast is usually better than getting top dollar sales. There is a middleground but every sale is profit, and theres a really low 25k cap ceiling.
---
That I did not know. Good to know.
---
Ah yes. I can't wait to kill with an instigating faster swing-speed +1st Shovel. :)
---
I mean the first camera, you cant find broken cameras until you have the first one
---
Okay....this is a real challenge .... 
---
As I never was good at chemistry,I will give it a try....🤣
---
If that doesn't work I'll will try some vending machines .....
---
If that doesn't work I will have to put up a internet  connection at my camp and post a advertisement on Redit.😂😂...
---
Thx for the info and ..... Have a nice day ....
---
I love seeing how people circumvented the building mechanics to get something just as they imagined.
---
you know you are right, no need to come back and keep checking. bye felicia
---
Xb1.
---
You have loot pool for purveyor store?
---
Didn’t know that’d
---
I just walloped the bear on the nose with my all rise and finished it off with a shotgun.
---
If you hit him multiple times a day it might be randomed and to a client cache, I'm not sure though, ive found him twice in a day and he just had clock plans. Everytime I find the lemonade vendor he resets too if I spawn back to him/server hop.
---
I completed this challenge in adventure mood and got this gun. It was weird but I'm not complaining. Lol
---
The lists and windows are badly implemented. Different UI elements aren't connected together. It's crazy how it can be similarly bad doing the exactly same things, on both console and PC.
---
For the camera one the pics don’t register either
---
Kind offer but PS4 thx
---
If you knew how many nuclear eplosions actualy happened on earth, you will know, earth is fucking hard to destroy :D
---
The budget itself is fine for me since they changed the way the turrets work.
---
Personally I think this might be better off being changed for various letter signs. I have seen a large amount of shops (mine included) with the name in Neon above the door.
---
Those letters take a ridiculous amount of space when your already low on budget :/
---
Fasnacht Old Man Effigy plan for 5000 caps.
---
Yeah I don't get to play FO76 until the kids are asleep, I don't really want to be chatting to randoms at that time.
---
I dont turn on my mic unless theres a legendary or cool vendor near by. Then ill spam follow me and jump like a jack ass before I plug in and shoot random spawn vendor/graham
---
I can’t wait for 3* rolling pins and * safecracking leather armor
---
You think locking your doors makes you safe... lol cute
---
Where is the event?
---
A better direction might be to lower weights of items that you are selling once they are in the vendor as opposed to the stash limit?
---
1000 I think will come, but might be the final update in time.
---
Get yourself the regular .44 with Quad, it reloads the whole 24 rounds in one quick go 👍
---
To be honest I think it would depend on how many nuclear weapons are detonated, but it wouldn't take a while lot to destroy civilization as we know it.  I could w wrong with the two years thing actually it might take longer for the dust ejected into the upper atmosphere to settle, 5 years maybe I can't really see it being longer than that and then the planet would start to warm up again. I'm pretty sure after 25 years most of the planet would be well on the way to recovery, just a lot more radioactive than it once was. 
---
When I'm near a computer I'll have a look and try to see if I can find something. 😊
---
Are you actually searching the boxes? You have to manually press the search key (for me on PS4 it's triangle, idk what others have) to get the card to proc. I'm a day one player and it took me more levels than I care to admit to realize this...
---
I've come across six toons in the last hour and a half level 2 - 6 and selling literally tons of plans they couldn't have gotten that early, not to mention the loads of level 45+ armor and weapons they had.
---
I mean not to troll but for a (possible) once a year item that doesn’t seem unreasonable.  Luckily I got it already
---
Advice #2 is good up till like level 40. By then you should be more efficient at farming without resorting to selling weapons, and you can learn mods by scrapping them.
---
I have extra cameras crafted hoping u can place them in vending machine
---
Anyone else here basically abandoned hacking terminals or picking half the locks because they just don't wanna swap perks any more?
---
Paint me like one of your French girls.
---
Then you shall face the wrath of my guardian Brahmin!
---
Not at all, this was just an information post, not a complaint
---
Extra arms hmm....so people that actively contribute during events can carry more while those that stand around can scratch their asses while eating a sandwich and drinking a beer simultaneously...sign me up!
---
Thanks! I’ll join you shortly. GT Tapewyrm0
---
I need this too, add me IGN JaceIronbeard
---
Jup got the same issue. Everything that can fly got a 0% hit chance
---
Oh cool! I had no idea! Thanks for letting us know. Now I have more more hope to get that armored bagpack :D
---
Yea, true that! And them invis assultrons bruh 🤙
---
How is this still a thing.....
---
All the time since the beta it’s always been like that mate and I’m over lvl 200.
---
So you can CONFIRM that there is recon sensors for t-60 ?! 
---
I would but im on ps4 😥
---
Okay, you can hold down E to initiate a blueprint on an object that is in your point of aim. Then Z selects everything attached to it after that, or you can select each piece manually with C. I noticed they're all listed on the HUD in build mode so it may be different depending on your bindings or platform.
---
Really? I've been playing since the stress test and I never noticed it being this bad. My other character is in the 100's.
---
I love doing this too :)
---
Yeah I scraped all twice before I figured it out then cried s little tear
---
I've been grabbing the necessary bug parts (other than the one spoil-able item natch) and stocking them in my shop at like a cap or two. Because I know all too well how annoying it is to scrap all out of habit while on that particular quest...
---
Yes, same for me, got 2x lvl 200+ and 1x 60+ and it happens from time to time on all em chars, perhaps a bug since whitespring is a popular farming spot so the RNG pool might flicker from time to time, but thats only a guess and my own assumtion and not facts 😄
---
I list most plans at 50-90 caps, except for armor and PA plans.  
---
I’m still getting a feel on serums I started at 1k and sold a few but I’ve seen a lot of people selling them at 400-500 caps so I’ve since lowered my prices.  
---
Weapons and armor... idk.  Most good stuff I’ve seen go 1-3k depending on the affix.   The lower end stuff... 800 or less.   
---
I’m surprised by how little people are selling magazines and bobbles (50-100 caps) for but happy to buy them up!
---
Adding things to your vendor for sale takes budget space. I’ve been slowly taking apart my base to add things for sale, it’s honestly just fucking stupid. The drugs these devs must be on man.
---
And you shall face... my poop that I left in your bed ;)
---
That would cause more strain
---
Thank, I'm nowhere near 1000 scrip, but if for some reason I get close I know it's time to stop 😎
---
Nooooooooooo! 😲
---
Nope, I’ve been playing since the stress test
---
What the...? how is this even logical? They take budget space AND budget? FFS
---
Idk.  Makes ya think though.  I think it’s more location based. I had a spot in the mire and I rarely ever got attacked.   I moved near Solomon’s to help my vendor traffic and as soon I popped out my bad 3 scorch beasts swarmed me within seconds of wiring up my turrets... never got attacked in the more where I was at
---
It can be in middle of nowhere in fortest for all that we know. And data they datamined filed 2 holotapes.. We don't know if we are looking for next box or something else in there.
---
I'd honestly love this so much.
---
ye i reinstalled the game, it works now :)
---
Oof hope they either know this already or see this post.
---
Up to 1500 caps? 
---
I have anti armor railway 
---
If h want
---
Dang. Im ps4. You can try messaging them on price in game. Ive only had one peep come to their base and sell to me. It was a rifle that i was a little short on but traded the gun for caps and a plan for extra. How are you finding trade prices on xb?
---
I agree, or maybe just a custom emote we could make that says a short sentence. Definitely we need a no mic emote
---
Mine would be Combat, Shopping, Silos, and Crafting. And since I run Picklock and Hacker during Silos that'd be handy for any locks/terminals I find elsewhere too.
---
requires syrup and razorgrain flour. You have to eat 3 for possum bage
---
This is standard fair. To my understanding, most people farm those ghouls for legendary quantity and WestTek for quality (level &amp; 3 star). I'm partial to Burrows myself because there is junk, plenty of legendary ghouls and everyone seems to be anti-burrows, more for me I suppose. That said WestTek has more purpose overall than just legendary farming. One trip will net about 75 plastic and 500 steel with the scrapper perk and there's plenty of other junk as well.
---
Someone actually told me it was at white springs and I spend a good half an hour looking around for it.
---
Ahhh. I see.
---
Well thx for posting this and putting the effort into it.
---
sombody must have heard me.what did I find last night - the 50 cal reciever plans from both wotoga vendors.
---
now what are the chances of that. unless they have included the plans in the buff ?????????
---
I'd love this. 1 cap per is not worth it at all. Unless of course you're selling something expensive to craft. Like ultracite ammo.
---
Use a lvl 5 10mm. The melee vats was broken last patch
---
*cough* money laundering *cough*
---
Yeah man. Before the maintenance yesterday it used to not give it back when you took something out of the vendor, but that seems fixed, so I guess budget space being used is intended. I’m slowly breaking up random walls and my instruments etc.
---
Wait, I have to manually search them instead of using quick looting? What the hell?
---
On my first play session while I was adjusting things in params, one of the first thing I did was to mute others mics. I don't want to voice chat with strangers, I wouldn't talk with them in a real street, I don't see why I would in a wasteland.
---
so i need to rebuild my camp to return reserved budget space?
---
Oh okay
---
now that two shot has been nerfed, all the legendary prefixes (the 1st bonus) are situational and personal choice; goul slayers, bloodied, mutants, etc.
---
The secondarys are more obvious with exploding and faster fire rate usually prefered  for ranged and swing speed for melee
---
the tertiary bonus, again, is personal choice. My fav is 90% less weight.
---
AAE or BE gattling + dmg resist while aiming + bulletshield card, imortal while in PA and the dmg goes insane 🤙
---
i could imagine that on automatic melee weapons it was intentional but never ment to work on non automatic melee weapons and when they fixed the bug for the non automatic weapons they accidently destroyed it for the automatics
---
just an assumption though
---
Nuked borrows
---
Loot all guns and armour n sell em
---
Keep a reduced weight Railway for just such occasions 🤣
---
I’m pretty sure there’s something wrong with like half of the badges at this point.
---
No it’s fine now, you just need spare space to put things in the vendors. You’ll get the space back as they sell, it’s just before the maintenance you didn’t, but that’s fixed.
---
Oh it's been talked elsewhere. It might had been fixed already with the server update.
---
There was another gem from patch 9. Players who had huge amount of anything(or everything), who were over the absolute maxium weight limit, could only drop stuff so that it got destroyed. They could not drop stuff without it being destroyed, sell it to bots or trade it to players.
---
Here comes vendoring! Yep, they could go and vendor their stuff away. Maybe not everyone of them were hoarding 100k cloth and leather scrap, maybe some of them have various large stacks of legendaries from duping.
---
Just a friendly reminding. Nearly every active player who have played long, has duped stuff. 99% of duped stuff was never removed. Bethesda only had a highly spesific list of particular dupes they scanned from everyone, and removed all but one a piece of each type, from each account.(or char, no idea) Check the old update from fallout.com if you bother to dig it, as so much people mistook that was dupes were removed, and kept saying it over and over. Bethesda never said they removed dupes. Highly spesific targetted dupes. . Also considering how long ago that highly spesific list of legendaries got purged, it might it was composed more or mainly of TSE variants. When TSE was what it was, I think there was not a major reason to go and dupe something inferior like BE. I mean some probably duped some, but in anywhere equal scale.
---
So all sorts of non-spesific dupes, like, I don't know, furious explosive gathling plasma with agility, anyone could have 10k of them and no problem.  Probably most versions of AA E handmades. Except players having large stacks of them, couldn't do anything with them, because the items were locked and could only be chosen to be destroyed, until the char was below max limit.(which is what, 1k above carry weight. Or 1500 over it, or something in that range, doesn't matter) But vendoring got some of that stuff out of their virtual prison
---
Not sure if that vendoring was fixed, as could it be fixed with only server changes? Sooo, these old legacy weapons moving around might have been duped many many months ago, just old stock that got libereted. Even here someone mentioned about it. And much more on trading forums.
---
Looks more like F*cked up than fixed
---
for all answers check this:  [https://guides4gamers.com/fallout-76/quest/the-order-of-the-tadpole/](https://guides4gamers.com/fallout-76/quest/the-order-of-the-tadpole/)
---
Good to hear that! Now start grinding those useless legendary items. I showed up on patch day with 1400lb inventory, and was disappointed that there is a limit per day...so I'm stuck watching my movement speed slowly coming back with each day, too lazy to mule the stuff back.
---
Can anybody say stealth nerf
---
Just a really weird system, why not just have higher damage without repairing..
---
That's a bug. Just rejoin or find a new server.
---
Started happening a few months ago. I’ve been playing since the start and it didn’t happen back then, even though some people say it did. I played a lot and hung around whitesprings quite a bit.
---
Yessss you and me both been saving 2 regular ones 😂
---
Definitely wiring a speaker up to my pressure plate garage door! Great tip!
---
I use vats melee and mine will target but never swing so I have to use it to lock on then cut it off and swing it sucks
---
I honestly think this happens because of server lag the game thinks you are one place but you are in another then jerks you
---
I,m uk and play late night. I'm not sure whether the french/german/ dutch etc are on our servers or, I, on theirs, but trying to get a grip on some of these names..........
---
cheers
---
Pretty sure either the new event camp fire tales awards them or the dailies reward them because I have 2 and I haven’t done any of the challenges for possum
---
We've had the Plague, War and this Black one. There's the white one left.
---
I had an idea of an auction house; each player brings whatever they want to sell, places it into a machine and sets a reserve price. Other players bid on the item (somehow... terminal, pip boy?) and the winner claims the item from the machine.
---
Absolutely! The weapon &amp; armor counter in that display are the biggest draws, because people are hunting for legendaries.
---
Text chat with baloons overhead will solve the problem
---
Bloodied swing speed + 1 str melee is god tier now
---
Just use the regular flip switch, and put it behind a locked door. Much fewer complications haha
---
I thought maybe my AP was too low but then it would not show up at all.
---
So yeah - I mean you need vats for smaller enemies - some of those bugs can really mess you up quickly.
---
You can get + 30 damage to ghouls on gamma gun so why not
---
Yes. Torrents take up much space! As do turrets.
---
I think that the crops is quite a drain too. Otherwise I have no explanation for my small bar being out of building budget without any turrets and only one landbased purifier.
---
Walk. 🙃
---
Yea, if you build to big, you can't decorate for shit. See too many people make these 4x3 3 story buildings in their camps, yet you can see they try to decorate anyway. which can kinda work for what you might be doing, but it still doesn't work to well when you can't fill the space. I also like the appeal of slight cramped builds (for example, you can save a ton of space by facing the skinnier power armor station towards a wall. You won't be able to see much of the armor at all when crafting or working on it, but you can interact with everything just fine).
---
I don’t need proof. It’s a bug. Random ghouls and scorched or whatever will explode like sentry bots or legendary robots. It’s been around for a couple of patches and Bethesda still hasn’t fixed it.
---
Then we really do need the interior walls as those double walls to make them inner on both sides do take up too much of my precious budget.
---
Get wrecked. 🙃
---
did you ever figure out a solution to this? I didn't realize this was going to be an issue as I hadn't moved my camp in ages and then wasn't playing for a while. Decided to move my camp and now its a locked blueprint, takes 52% of my build budget and I can't get into it (my friend made me a few items to help me out way back)
---
Your welcome done the dead
---
But, but, but...
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afvhi-wQl7A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afvhi-wQl7A)
---
Had that a few times!
---
i know i know i really hate that too i love the buzzblade and ripper astheticwise not to mention the chainsaw so i really dont get why they are made essentially useless even with the repair"bug" they where not groundbraking 
---
im no programmer or anything but i think with weaponbalance there is a mayor problem that could be solved very easily within a hotfix
---
plasma works now but lasers still suck 
---
by now when i see they buff something im almost convinced to say it wont be enough
---
when they announced buffing lasers i was so glad and looking forward to it just to find out the buff was nothing but a joke
---
if you dont have an explosive laser or a complete build around a specific legendary they are still useless
---
as far as i can tell bethesda pretty much nerfs things down tu uslessnes while buffing way too uneffective i mean do they test things at all?
---
but in all faireness it seems to get a bit better lately
---
I've noticed no matter what the color is when u pick up a hard hat, it always turns to that same grayish color...
---
Because you cant . It only comes on melee weapons and armor
---
Hrmmm maybe I should post it on their Forum with the videos then
---
You could probably still get a few thousand for the lot, but nowhere near what they used to be
---
If anything should be, it’s mister fuzzy tokens. They’re limited to what, 3 a day? So no non-exploiting inflation is possible. Theyre already traded for caps too.
---
Yeah it could be. 
---
Hope they see it as I think it may be super easy to fix. But I’m no engineer so what do I know. 
---
For now I’ll go be on the “toe-stub-theory” ha
---
Camp Adams, by NW of Poseidon power plant
---
Nice, good to know!
---
hoy. stop disrespecting the [shovel. Do](https://shovel.do) you have any idea, just how long it took me to find a feckin shovel. TWICE cos i scrapped first one.
---
This “toe-stub-theory” is getting a trend
---
It's not a lifetime max... it's the max you can have at any one time.... you spend 100, you can get another 100 if within daily cap...
---
I have not yet. Saving caps to buy the fat man plan.  I also only know of one location they spawn at and that is in the green goo vats at west tek. I scrapped 3 so far and haven’t gotten the mod yet.
---
Bloodied 40% faster swing 90% weight reduction Bone Club is the new caveman meta!
---
But what about legendary Sheepsquatch Staffs (and Chainsaws while you're at it, come on!)?
---
I have an Intelligence bobblehead selling for 25k. I have a sign on the vending machine that says "if you buy this, you need it badly".
---
So far nobody has bought it.
---
Honestly I almost wish they'd just tweak a bunch of the aid item weights lower. Really wanna stock my shop with food and drinks and chems, but it's so hard to fit it all in the stash. YES an increase would do the job too, but it's also just annoying that every single beer is an entire lb. Wish they'd cut beverage, stimpak (maybe most aid really), and grenade weights basically in half. There's definitely some way too heavy Ammos out there too though (lookin at you plasma cartridges, harpoons, railway spikes, cannonballs, heck even flares).
---
Back from a hiatus from this game. Glad to see people are still bitching about the same shit they were bitching about 6 months ago.
---
Chainsaws was the 1st thing I looked for... she wont be selling those.
---
Prostitution
---
I usually run from the gorge workshop down to Gauley mine, slocums Joe, and then a little further south to an unmarked house that has a random encounter spawn, and then across the road towards the overseers camp. I usually find around 40 firecaps along the route (with green thumb on). You might have to look carefully, and i jump around a lot because marsupial gives you a nice aerial view, and the orange pops out of the grass a little better from above.
---
Oh no...
---
That happened... wtf
---
It should link.  Games on Ubisoft, you can buy through Ubisoft launcher and then will link to steam.  Bethesda should make this clear though
---
r/madlads
---
I like the idea! I am also hoping we get Robot Crafting as per Automatron. One of my fave things to do in FO4 was making Robot settlers.
---
They want a place where they can advertise and have sales indefinitely. They will probably sell atoms through steam as well. Five years from now when Bethesda doesn’t have a fallout license and not much exposure to the masses through advertisements. They will need steam for that so they can keep getting checks in the mail.
---
I bought a mic specifically for the game. Still haven't spoken to anyone though.
---
There is no point gathering the flux 'plants' unless you have everything else ready to go ie glowing mass.hardened mass and high radiation fluids.
---
!0 plants for one of each of the above.
---
Whenever I do a SBQ event I always look for enemies killed in the nuke zone for those items then decide how many plants I need. I think you have no more than an hour to craft it at a chemistry bench before some of them expire ( probably less ).
---
Yes! Add that post-hence, my brain is at 5:30am rate right now ir else it would have mentioned that and i think the nuka cola mixers from NW?
---
Maybe dont put this on a sub that Bethesda actually looks at...
---
At what point do we get de powah? And de women after that?
---
Ok that's pretty cool.
---
the recipe vendor sells it at the whitesprings sometimes
---
From what I remember, some things related to text chat existed already in the files according to a modder that added proximity chat as a mod.  If it's true, then it was definitely a consideration, but they just didn't follow through for other reasons which I don't think were solely because the game is multiplatform.  I think it's a bit of a stretch to assume we don't get this or that because we share the game with consoles, that has never really been an issue before, I'm skeptical to imagine it is now.
---
Graphic settings. That's all really.
---
My understanding of it is limited, but it's called CVAA and it apparently now extends to video games after an initial exception expired several months ago.  That's all I can really say for certain of it now, whether that's really the reason why 76 doesn't have text-chat yet is unclear.  Only Bethesda really knows the answer to that.

Scorched beast queen.
---
Serum recipes are available in the enclave bunker - science wing
---
5k+
---
I don't think I have ever got a serum recipe from the SBQ.
---
In about 30 events. Unlucky I suppose.
---
So when you go into a bar and say give me beer instead of give me a soda you would consider that a customized order?
---
Ok cool because I’ve been trying to sell mine and I got offered 5k
---
Yes. If you store a vending machine then anything in it is no longer for sale.
---
Man you just gotta make de money first, then comes de money. And once you got de money? Well then you get de women.
---
Ya absolutely! Being a Heavy Gunner means you're carrying your whole arsenal at all times, because it's like impossible to fit more than a few in the stash. O honestly think a lotta aid items need weight adjustment too though, especially now that they can be dropped in Survival and seriously need to be stashed before exploring.
---
K, thanks, last dozen times I’ve been there he’s had nothing unknown to me :(
---
Not anymore. Only way now is from other players or enclave bunker. Serum recipe were removed from loot pool a few patches ago.
---
Enclave bunker science lab vendor. They sell for 18800 give or take caps depending on perks and charisma. The serum themselves for 3200 give or take
---
Yep, this..
---
Thankyou
---
SBQ no longer drops recipes. They were removed from loot pool a few patches ago
---
When the time comes, go out to a random secluded area and find a container. Hide a few items there to free up some stash room. Get your loot from the purveyor, throw em in your stash, then go grab hidden items and stick them in the machine. I know... pain in the ass, but just wanted to throw the idea out there for you. That or have a friend hold on to some stuff or help you move items over to a mule.
---
520 detonations over 74 years. All but two in un-populated areas, 8 under water.
---
In a Mutually Assured Destruction scenario... we're talking about firing *several thousand*, all going off within a few hours, all over populated areas. (Populated areas tend to burn a little easier than deserts and oceans do). 
---
Just a couple of nukes though. 3 tops. 😜
---
But seriously, think about 3 nukes going off *in just your city*. What most people don't realize is, its not 1 nuke per city, and like a couple more for Washington and Moscow. *It's like several nukes targeted at each city, military base, industrial center, ports, and highways in the middle of nowhere for good measure*. Literally anything that could be used to resist the USSR was/is a valid target. Major universities were targets. The phrase "glassed" doesn't even begin to describe it. Fallout 4's "Glowing Sea" might be a good analogue. For the entire country. Just no death claws (probably). 
---
If the general public knew how absolutely fucked they would be in a real, full-scale nuclear war... there would have been a riot on Reagan's front lawn to stop it!
---
Consider this: Mega volcanoes have caused mini-ice ages. The number of things exploding and burning at once would be many times more ash-producing than that.
---
I sold a 3-star in my vending machine for 18k
---
Lame
---
Damn that much jeez
---
Oh when you said wondering around I figured you meant the woods and shit.
---
Legendary ultracite Gatling laser? Yes.
---
I AM at work, but I don't need to open this because...Burt Reynolds.
---
Why is this so vivid in my mind?
---
Yeah I left poop at a players front door who had his vending machines behind level 3 locks, I mean come on
---
yeah i rarely find things i don't have on him anymore but i'm server hopping him to help a friend find a recipe &amp; that's one of the ones i just happened to read to her
---
Ok thanks I’ll keep trying, it’s the only possum cook challenge one I don’t have :(
---
EPIC!
---
That is so cool, never knew about that easter egg!
---
Also, it feels so good to be nearly invincible to fall damage with goat legs, bird bones and marsupial
---
Oh, thanks for correcting me then.
---
I'd rather pay 33% more and get a 3 star ranged. I already have my armor and rarely melee anyway.
---
Makes regular repair kits less useless, I guess.
---
add a switch to the front of the machine, and then you can turn it off
---
i’ve seen a super mutant’s head for 25k caps. seems like a bargain not gonna lie.
---
I had similar issue, but i closed up shop and locked my doors. Problem solved. At least until bethesda can get their act together.
---
Flashbacks of oblivion
---
Yea this is what i was told guess i got to save up then.
---
Whoops. Lol
---
Yea, crops are another biggie. Maxed my budget fast when I had to add in razorgrain and corn.
---
Another whining thread on this? The cwndor isn't even in the game yet, stop crying already. By all appearances we will be able to pick our main effect and the weapon itself, let's face it, you stand a good chance of getting a very good roll. Since you're so disappointed feel free to not use the vendor and continue complaining about all your wood armor drops.
---
You get them on Reddit
---
Go over to the moth-man museum. South West on the map. Literally says *Mothman* on the map. Just south east of the mothman museum is a swarm of cargo bots, all circling over and area just outside the explorable map. Hop on top of that bridge down there and snap a couple of shots.
---
Then pay your respects to the Mothman.
---
My guess is, this is their holding oattern area, and when someone calls for one ising a US Government Supply Requisition at a radio tower, a bot flies away from it.
---
yeah that's why she's looking for fox jerky, it's been a bitch of a search
---
Good to know
---
&gt;Even if your vending machine has no power people can still buy from it. 
---
Is he right or are you correct, time will tell??
---
I've been spared, but I both have publicly available toilets and clearly marked "Employees only" signs on the way to my bed to make sure that wouldn't happen.
---
For the mammal one the animals can be dead. I killed everything except the cats which registered without dying and don't run away like assholes.
---
The Brahmin milking was really frustrating. I ended up doing the cows in flatwoods and served hopping if it was unclear if it worked.
---
legendary pipe revolver? yes please
---
Vending machines don't require power to function. The only thing power does is make your camp visible on map.
---
I crawled out of white springs carrying way over my stash and weight limit in crap legendary. Took 4 days to sell all the crap.
---
All I want is snowy west virginia
---
Yes the nights are much to bright, I tend to use my Nvidia overlays to make shadows darker and effectively make it dark, after all, what is the point in nightvision scopes and a torch if you can see everything all of the time.
---
I found one at the stores in Whitesprings 2 weeks ago,  scrapped it and learned the plan.
---
Good luck! If I come across it I’ll let you know/pick up a copy (PC)
---
Saw some camps today that were so close they *had* to have done it intentionally. Still not touching or anything, but definitely at the closest possible distance. Really wonder if they had any more friends who just weren't online that also had camps in their little cluster like that, and what it'd look like if half a dozen or more people Camped as close as possible somewhere open and flat.
---
Yea mate for as long as I been playing the ghouls even if there non legendary drop legendary items at times idk why but it’s always been like that especially at whitesprings!
---
I just looked up the normal spawns and just jumped to each spawn till I found it. Didn't have to jump servers but it will cost caps. I think each server has one location.
---
Where you on pc
---
Added on the 9.0 patch
---
When you scroll through that list you suddenly realise just how unlikely it is to get the 1 item you want....
---
VATS is cancer, should be removed
---
Keep an eye out on reddit. Sometimes players will sell anywhere between 2500 to 10k caps per recipe. 
---
Some of the subreddits to check out.
---
r/market76 and r/fo76bazaar
---
Do you know where to find it in the world?
---
thank you, you too! we're on PS4, but it would be nice to at least get confirmation that he DOES sell it haha
---
IV seen some silly things priced high, last night I found a lower level camp with some 1-2* stuff all for dirt cheap, but there was stuff like random hats and average outfits for 3k+ lol. I restocked on bs legendaries from a couple of those.
---
You mean every 3 hours
---
Everyone's CAMP: *Massive mansions with beautiful decor*
---
My CAMP: https://i.imgur.com/BRvedSZ.png
---
And there we have it, close the shop and lock the doors then kill the customers... problem solved.
---
Can you encase it in a walled off room?
---
Dont forget prison collars.
---
Yeah thats exactly what i mean!
---
Being handed the note doesn't kick off the quest.
---
sadly you can not.
---
Go get some "IOU Toilet Paper" notes to use!
---
Remove stuff from sale?
---
Can u drop for a friend?
---
interesting, Fat mans. Has someone ever gotten a Legendary Fat man besides the one from the quest? Because i have never seen one before.
---
This one was only level 50. I'll be looking for that 80 now!
---
Nope, dropping the camera junks it.
---
You need the tourist, it is the only way.
---
Yep boy scouts repetible quest, if i am not wrong the one you have to collect a lot of insect parts :D
---
tip - wait until its all almost over to get the flux. the plants are still mutated for a good while. harder to find hardened mass etc but again,can still be obtained.
---
but if all the other players have left the field, then the insanity backs of and no -one can moan that you havn't attack the queen. Your hardened mass goes in your junk,so if you die.......
---
We weren't aware it spawned outside of the event and I haven't seen anywhere it's posted.
---
No, unfortunately on Xbox. The helmet makes you look like snake eyes from  GI Joe. Has 1 dmg resistance but cannot mod it
---
Of course you do. Everything is relative.
---
This. I mean hit a mutie or deathclaw isn't an issue but  stingwings or even worse the tiny fireflys are just annoying without vats
---
Ouch :(
---
Third time is the charm though :)
---
Thats even more wack
---
Ok, thanks :D
---
Yes, but the only course around that area is the ropes course (same with the camp Venture one (haven't don't that one yet))  so I thought they meant that one, similar to how the one at Camp McClintock worked.
---
I've played since beta and the state of the game was horrible at launch. It has very much improved since then with ongoing updates and content.
---
Oh ok I'm talking about the marine combat helm
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Marine_armor_(Fallout_76)
---
The shop itself needs a better interface. I love that they added it, do *not* mistake me haha, but having to manage seperate inventories for every machine I build is a bit sloppy. Not to mention every time I set a price from an item that is already in the stash instead of in my player inventory it starts bugging out and scrolling/skipping around.
---
When and what platform?
---
Sold a shovel in my player shop for 100 caps the other day. I hate finding those things and I guess others do too.
---
I'll give you 7k rn
---
Damn I sold it for 5 already
---
Well on the bright side none of the other fallouts had text chat so you should feel right at home ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-76-legendary-vendor-is-arriving-a-week-early-heres-your-first-look-at-her-inventory/ This has the information  on the vendors inventory. You will not get to pick anything other than number of stars and melee, ranged or armor.
---
Are you talking about this helmet that looks like a bug  https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Marine_tactical_helmet_(Fallout_76) 
---
Or this helmet 
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Marine_tactical_helmet_(Fallout_76)
---
The actual marine helmet
---
Or 40, if it's a Ripper lol
---
buy the headset. you dont need to talk, but the audio is top notch AND directional. You can hear WHERE that noise came from.
---
Yep, open med box, or med cab/mirrors, grab the chems then push search and more chems pop up. Get the chemist perk and dilute chems into 4 diluted stims possibly 8 with super duper. Then sell
---
AAAAAAAA YOURE A SAINT
---
I heard something about legendary power armor. Does it mention that?
---
Why are even subbed then
---
I love my Anti Armor + 40% Swing speed together with the martial arts perk. It's also got the Fairbairn Sykes Atom Shop skin. I kill a single tough enemy a bit slower than the guys with the big hammers that one-shot a lot of higher enemies, but I have more fun and when attacked by four lvl 20 molerats... I kill them all qiucker than they kill one of them.
---
There's serrated blade or something like that as a mod by the way. I think I have two. One that gives bleed and one that gives a little more damage.
---
Yeah the feeling of someone breathing into your neck like a creep. Absolutely unique game experience!
---
I accept just got it as a reward for doing that mirelurk quest near the Scout camp today
---
I dont know, what if i have a glitched or hacked account and just give everyone thousands and thousands of caps
---
I was sort of thinking by the time I got around to checking out the player vending (after acquiring the first backpack) that most people would have sold their best things. I was pleasantly mistaken.
---
Found a one star Bloodied Lever Action at the first shop I visited. Snapped that up, it does more damage than my Prime Executioner Explosive variant... Bummer. Second camp I visited had a one star Bloodied Hunting Rifle. Doesn't compare to the lever action in DPS, of course, but I bought it for variety and the odd challenge.
---
Also bought the Shielded BoS plans. I've clocked nearly 700 hours but I've yet to progress the BoS plot.
---
I loose more mutation because of stupidity, like equipping superduper and forgetting it's equipped instead of starched
---
Yeah the game had a pretty bad launch tbh, but it's vastly better now. If you're into just wandering the world 76 has undoubtedly the best and biggest Bethesda map. Tons of little details and huge locations.
---
https://i.imgur.com/bo9vBGv.jpg
---
Cool thanks!
---
It is and it isn't.
---
I've got the plan to build it because a random stranger have me one and I scraped it.
---
But pretty sure originally it was a Dev room only item that has spread right out and is the only helmet that has damage resistance
---
The actual marine helmet.
---
Um, ok, don't use it. Problem solved!👍😂
---
np
---
it'd be nice. I just plain hate voice chat so I disabled it.
---
I had to google the spawns, and there not a certain,that they'll be their. 100 caps for shovel, might have paid that. Wouldn't have been worth it (let the body rot ), but I can't just let it go.
---
tent next to the sam site in cranberry bog, sticking out a corpse, if anyone looking.found 5 others but can't remember where. or theres one now permenantly in my stash.
---
Yeah. I killed a little over 30 queens since the BETA and me and my best friend never seen any mutation recipe .Dupers probably got it from dev room long ago otherwise i can't explain
---
Or just scrap the machine or store it in your camp?
---
Didn’t work. There’s no doubt this is a Bethesda issue. Hopefully we’re not the only ones and others speak up so they do something to fix it. Otherwise I’m all done with the game. Lost way too much stuff and time if I have to start over.
---
Ok cool. Guess I will just have extras
---
Thanks man I'll update my post about mama Murphy's pick and use this as reference!
---
yeah i just use shotgun now as secondary gun to cripple enemies.
---
i was a full shotgun build now i am switching to heavy guns
---
yes i'm on PC no I can't give it to you at least not for 10 hours I'm working
---
Ah, you are correct, I misunderstood the article and picture yesterday. Same applies though, it's still better than what we have, and we don't even know what she's going to drop yet, so there's no way to be disappointed yet. If she comes out and constantly drops only 3* wood armor or zealots junk then yeah, but not until then.
---
Yeah.....a TSE handmade goes for 15-25k......sorry you got some bad advice.
---
Mostly between 12-15k.
---
Thx for the tip....
---
Best thing to do just hang around the scout camp and chances are you'll run into someone just starting the quest.
---
Really good compared to Reddit marketplace. Soo good I lowered my prices on all my guns/armor
---
I just bought one from a vending machine for 12k lol I was pretty close to the cap for caps so had to get rid of a chunk of it quick.
---
Hey man, everyone has to start with a dirt hut.
---
Yup, but I still like it.
---
What kind of moron would pay 25k for this
---
well , there are of course, a few draw backs, yes, ..............you can disable the chat though.
---
&gt;it runs at less than 10 FPS
---
Although still more than your IQ.
---
I thought everyone knew by now. I posted 2 days ago and there were a lot of people that had problems with the new challenges
---
This... Milking the cows was a nightmare. I tried Flatwoods, no luck. I assume Brahmin milking isn't instanced. I could see the prompt to milk, but it didn't work. Hopped servers at least five times with no success. 
---
Managed to get the milk from the three cows east of the Top of the World station (in the river) by server hopping, though.
---
A stealth nerf or a stealth fix, not sure which unless Bethesda talks about it.
---
What surprises me the most is not many people seem to care about it.
---
I suggest you to make a 2x1 room with powered gate and place your vendors inside. So when you switched it off, your door will close and nobody will reach them. Also if you want to prevent any abuse about it, use keypad switcher.
---
Also you can check mine, I'm pc player.
---
You can either buy them at Vendors or just randomly find them.
---
I found 4 last night at the Valley Gallaria
---
I have. One star Quad capacity.
---
Well is it 2* or 3*? The assassins prefix alone isn't worth anything
---
Hold up, though. Urban scout armor, but not forest?
---
Cool story bro 👍🏻
---
This was thing in past. I was one of first people who had recipe for chameleon mutation. I was super unlucky and had multiple eggheads and all that stupid useles mutations. But i killed SBQ more than 100times.
---
Ive got a 1* bloodied fatman 
---
And a 3* two shot, 90% reduced Weight, +40% bash damage fatman :)
---
Waaaaaahhhhh. When I first started gaming it was on a 48k Sinclair Spectrum. Now that sucked!
---
Some people have theirs locked inside, along with all their workbenches. Hate it when people lock their Camps, it's not like we can mess them up anymore anyways.
---
That's my favorite place to build on the map. 
---
They definitely put more effort into the mire than any where else *coughs*theashheap*coughs*
---
It happens with Ghouls in Whitespring a lot due to there being so many legendary monsters in Whitespring.
---
The issue is they really are legendary ghouls.  But they have the Diseased tag which is hiding the Legendary tag.  The game only shows one tag and Diseased takes priority.  Can happen with other types but Ghouls in Whitespring are the most common.   
---
Happens in Camp Venture near the Tech Data turn in area often too.
---
This [YouTube](https://youtu.be/x_m4hhig1fw) video has 10 spots where it can be found. That's how I got mine.
---
It works with the harpoon gun too! I used about 200 harpoons back in Fallout 4 to get the free fall legs
---
Those who pay 20k for a tse obviously have not tried any better weapons 😁
---
The data miners has discovered that the pool of items for her to drop include every type of weapon and armor including scout armor, so you might get wood, you might get marine there is no telling until you buy it. And wood armor only exists in 1 star varieties. From what I can tell the chances of each prefix and extra effects are the same as always now you just pay for star count.
---
Where would I be able to look to find current market pricing of specific items is there a website?
---
Yes. This.
---
The thing is though that at my bar, it's the bear proof trash can outside, the cigarette machine by the door, the magazine rack just inside the door, and so on. If you're not familiar to how that works it may be hard to tell that they all are stash boxes.
---
I sold a BE pump for 15k . Only offer, even at half health u probably get double dmg compared to a tse version
---
Big agree, hope it's something that comes soon. I thought there were rumors about there being some way to deal with unwanted ammo in the future so maybe that'll tie into it.
---
I PvE primarily and I find this change has genuinely killed shotguns, there is no reason to use them now. The do less damage point blank on a TSE than a Mole Miner Gauntlet WITHOUT any unarmed/melee spec.
---
I am currently working on a spec change to heavy weapons. They fucked my sentinel armour and my shotgun so I am going the other end of the spectrum and using PA.
---
Grinding new cards post 100 sucks though.
---
Try getting improved cappacity backpack. -60er -60rr
---
You're about six months late fella...
---
Shoot 'em in the legs first to stop them running up and tearing your face of with one blow.
---
You get to pick ⭐ quality
---
Ranged weapons 
---
Melee weapon
---
Armour piece
---
And then it just randomly rolls you an item from the category chosen.
---
I got it last week, enjoying. It very much. Havent had any issues. I really like the game. Its worth the money
---
I found this last night when looking for wolves, south of big al's. I was surprised to see that when I googled "Mysterious Box fo76" nothing came up. It's cool to see this is part of the update
---
Two shot is far from best anymore
---
If your camp spot is taken and you move to a different server so you don't lose your camp it will also remove all items for sale and you need to do them all over again.
---
Couldn't agree more honestly, I quit a while ago. It's hilarious to see people still play it and defend it really.
---
there is a shovel spawn in uranium fever room, in the middle :P
---
The more the better in all honesty.
---
Add me and we’ll get an army together 
---
I’m free next week
---
I killed 3 lvl 80 sb. Should i make a video lol
---
I'm not that good at math, so please correct me if i'm wrong, but doesn't this mean that to get your one desired weapon the chance is pretty damn low?
---
1/44 (desired ranged weapon chance) * 1/23 (primary effect) * 1/7 (secondary effect) * 1/9 (tertiary effect) = sadness
---
If this isn't the way it's calculated please do correct me.
---
Chat mod is literally The Barrens chat from World of Warcraft. It's that bad.
---
I'm surprise there isn't one out  by now. Wild Appalachia is almost over.
---
if no one else helps I could probably help you in about 10 hours either way keep me in mind
---
There have been countless threads, petitions and discussions about text chat.   
---
And we still want text chat. The game has got better after patches and wild appalaccia content, so they could bring even more players with that. And also many of us who already play would enjoy it much more. And those who don't like it, can hide chat like in every game that has it. Discussion finished xD
---
If you relocate your camp, and it is part of a structure then no. But once you manually store the vendor machine everything resets.
---
I've been trying to trade away my TSE handmade for 2 weeks now for a better weapon i constantly get offers for 25k+ (best was 40k)
---
If I remember correctly you also to factor in that the bombs used in the fallout universe are more in line with the ones used in  nagasaki and aren't the mothers of all bombs we have in our world. Those were information given by the creators way back when in the collector's edition of fallout 2 I believe
---
Yeah can you just store it or you don't want to put all 30 things back in it?
---
PS4 ... anybody want a TSE Gatling Gun?
---
Is wooby the one talking
---
Because I've seen others report the enlightenment challenge as completed you should probably put up a ticket on Bethesda support site.
---
Am I the only one here who actually likes the emote system?
---
Coming from proper toxic games, Fallout is a nice relaxing place to be without some cunt yelling abuse at your face in voice or chat...
---
Its so hilarious people thought bethesda would start handing out god rolls 😂 that vendor is awesome for the most casual players out there
---
If anyone needs revive in water on xb1 I'll help you if you help me
---
There's also one  behind the vendor in flatwoods in the little cemetery there
---
If you use search function there is like 100+ posts with same question from this week only

(Added May 9) Repair: Repairing an item beyond 100% Condition no longer incorrectly provides an increase to some stats.
---
Dev Note: Condition should only affect how long an item lasts before it needs to be repaired. We found that overrepairing items resulted in small buffs to certain character stats, which was not intended. This was not originally noted during our initial patch notes process, but has been now added to the patch notes for clarity
---
Litterally no one has done the frog challenges, as they are glitched. Pick another one bro
---
It is very annoying
---
Any idea on how levels work?
---
I find them in toolboxes all the time
---
confession time.
---
i to thought it was the rope course but... i built a camp outside it out of frustration on the hanging logs part and built a stairway to the roof of the end part and hopped down inside only to learn it wasn't the right spot...
---
Measure the distance by fast travel caps.
---
I thought that issue has been fixed a few patches ago! I don't currently use energy weapons much so cannot add any more insight, but I do remember some balancing in that area.
---
Yeah, happens to me on PC fairly regularly. No idea why.
---
i normally listen to music or audio books while playing games and while i do own a mic chances are at any point when i try and speak you would get something like "hey gu- ASS BITCH LET ME SEE YOU SHAKE THAT ASS  -ink we should be doing?"  People find it a little distracting.
---
There is also the text chat mod that works well though Bethesda can break it any time they like as it only just started working again after a couple of weeks of it being down.

---
this.
---
why cant they set it back and for those who do struggle to see can have an option in the game settings labeled \[Gamma setting\], you know, like games of ye old times.
---
maybe even throw in an extra setting for those thats just brighter nights
---
They can be found randomly in many containers around the world. I came across several last night.
---
Go to Converted Munitions Factory on Notrh est of map.
---
You will if you repair the landing pad, a Cargo spawn, then you can captur it !
---
Please take with a pinch of salt - although in actuality it costs you nothing to check because you need the fox meat anyway - because I have not checked the esm since I unlocked all the recipes (well, all the ones that can be unlocked, one of Delbert's recipes spawns inside the collision of one of the picnic tables in the Spruce Knobs Campground, good luck getting that one) but picking up fox meat from a fox carcass used to unlocke the jerky recipe.
---
If we're talking upgrades to the crossbow, it could sure as hell use a change to its sights. I don't even mean options for scopes or reflex sights (though they would be nice), I mean a change to the standard iron sight on the weapon's basic model. As it stands they're not used correctly at *all* \- its zeroing is jacked up to like 800 meters, but the crossbow's held perfectly level while aiming so the front sight is completely out of the picture. The rear sight needs to be fixed so it visibly isn't set to such a high zero, and it functionally allows us to see the front sight and aim the weapon properly.
---
In the patch notes
---
It’s been disabled until further notice
---
oh damn thank you!
---
Mole rats sometimes have mines strapped to them in FO4, are you sure it wasn't the same thing?

That's fine, and nobody's asking to remove voice chat. We want to have a choice.
---
thats not how light level works ;)
---
Yeaaah... I though that my camp looked nice because i put a bit of time in it, but compared to other ? Nope
---
He wrote urban twice, I think it's a copy/paste error.
---
Read.. the ... patch notes, next time!
---
Option set to party? If you mean team that's why, set it to auto to switch between the two if need be or do it manually to area. That said I have a bug that resets my chat volume slider to 0 every time I play. It's annoying and I'm constantly missing out on other people talking until I notice and fix it.
---
THE TOASTER IS JUST A DEATH RAY WITH A SMALLER ENERGY SUPPLY!
---
And so what?
---
That explains the price. PS4 has the most traders and that is keeping prices down in PS4. PS4 trade prices are pretty consistently half of what they are in Xbox or PC.
---
So to be clear, you have team (you called it party) chat on and that is working when you are in a team. 
---
If you have team chat only set then you can only hear team chat and no other channels unless you switch to area or auto.
---
I sometimes find it gets problematic on teams, usually when I get a server disconnect and rejoin. In which case we set up a PSN party chat and have that take priority.
---
Wait there is wn option for chat volume?
---
Will set it on auto than, its on area atm
---
Oof, didn't even notice Urban was there twice. My brain must have just skipped over the second set.
---
Haha I'll take it. Hope springs eternal.
---
Ohh okey, thank you
---
Patchhhhhh notesssss and search barrrrrrr
---
Yes, and it often resets to 0. Party chat on PSN at least works better and allows for my group to coordinate across two teams this way.
---
want to know a cheaty way to climb out?
---
invest in a weightless crossbow, carry about 50 bolts.
---
fire several at the wall, into eachother if you can.
---
congratulations you just made a ladder that will probably be nerfed at some point.
---
It is a bit finnicky about whether an animal will "register" on the camera, and at what range. Had a lot of inconsistency with that.
---
I've got the *worst* luck with milking brahmin, too. They always just kick at me and I get no milk.
---
Oh thats really handy to have 2 full squads. The partys are nice, but than you cant get those golden random encounters
---
Just get it. You won’t regret it

if i ever see you ingame feel free to ask for some build help, i'm no super builder but i enjoy making tiny village style camps :)
---
I was gonna try to get the Radscorpion Venom barrel instead of going for Bleedout, but the blasted scorpions didn't want to drop their stingers so I had to settle. Bleedout did a surprising amount of damage, though, so it was definitely a good way to go.
---
Yep I get this often
---
What system do you do your adventuring on?
---
True but generally if I am with my group in that way we work as a group especially for nuke launches, events and SBQ. If I'm alone or in just a pair then it's different.
---
I've not finished rebuilding my camp yet but I would like to get a little more space to play with just to spruce the place up a little. I'm at a spot near Top of the World as there's a good supply of water there for the industrial purifiers and I've had to downsize the camp to get everything sorted out.
---
The camp itself looks ok, but it is a bit sparse on decoration as I've not got a lot of headway to play with. A little extra space for posters and such would be nice.
---
Damn i didn't think about this. That would really suck if the lvl was random as well
---
Thanks for all your help! I've finally released my maps [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/?) If you have any suggestions I'm all ears.
---
I didnt think about it like that nice thinking. I was wondering about the nuke part, i got a code of a officer so what should i do with it?
---
it’ll probably scale to your lever, at least i hope it does
---
I hope not I have no use for low level gear.
---
Yeah, gonna go out on a limb here and say there probably isn't any item in the game that's actually worth 25000 caps.
---
I seen the list this morning, I'm very excited for the legendary scout armor, unyeilding scout armor would be awesome! Just hope they fix the mods for it. Either way, being able to choose a 3 star weapon will he much better than farming the poor drops that are currently, even though with a 1k scrip cap there will still be alot of farming, I'd like to think that in 10 tries you can get a good weapon from her though.
---
Very nice, especially now with the new challenges requiring numerous teddybears and magazines and what not.
---
I'm hoping it does. But weapon level has no effect on the amount of scrip earned. So it may be RNG
---
I found quite a few on ghouls in Whitesprings
---
Ok I'm sold. Let's have a third mode. I would worry about population density though.
---
Ultracite Gatling Laser? 
---
Okay - let them comming in the loot table, makes me happy.
---
There are 7 pieces for each silo. If you go to the Enclave bunker, if you've got that far in the main quest which I guess you haven't by your question, it tells you where to find others and a very rough hint on how to decrypt them. But people also publish the codes too.
---
Love the name. However I hate the fact you fill my mailbox with all those coupons!
---
Should be the same with hacking the current system pisses me off because it makes builds invalid when everyone can just "let me change out my cards"
---
Ohh okey cool, with the main story i jeed to go the top of the world. But havent done that yet because i think im underleveled and i want to hit lvl 25, before im going to do the main story sny further
---
My door everytime I come back to camp https://m.imgur.com/VKtqYhx
---
Language can be an issue especially with audio: Not everyone speak the same fluently.
---
What you could learn is tricks and builds that you can copy at your own CAMP. That way your CAMP will improve over time and become as cool/nice/impressive.
---
Popular Science covered this very subject in an article. https://www.popsci.com/article/science/computer-models-show-what-exactly-would-happen-earth-after-nuclear-war 
---
(If direct links aren’t allowed in this sub, my bad.)
---
Excellent maps! I thank you for your time spent and my time saved.
---
if you get a legendary pipe revolver... you win hands down
---
I've had many legendary Fat Mans drop. I usually sell them due to stash weight but kept a 3* AA double crit one. Not for sale.
---
That's just the counter on the 10% player vending fee
---
I mean i get it that they're supposed to fix this but why not fix the more urgent problems first? I don't think anyone had a problem with this.
---
There is still one add on left in "Wild Appalachia" however we're also getting another event as well.  
---
1. The Purveyor on the 16th of May  
---
2. Event: Project Paradise.  
---
We're getting an inside the vault article for Project Paradise next week, maybe we might get some fragmented info next week.
---
some people have locked off sections of their bases but leave windows right next to an interactable object so I can get in fairly easy so I mess with their switches computers and leave fertilizer on their bed
---
what are you talking about?
---
I received multiple in the hours after the update, but haven't received any since. I'm starting to think they hotfixed it :/
---
The games gotten A LOT better.
---
Positives:
---
Bugs are mostly squashed (at least on consoles),
---
Lots of crafting options and plans to collect,
---
LOTS of “busy work” (quests, building your camp, creating a player shop/store, getting rich, exploring the map),
---
Lots of legendary weapons and armour,
---
Some quests are great, while other are “okay”. I’ve never done a “bad/boring one” yet.
---
Player SHOPS! My god this saved the game for me. I can collect items and sell them to other players straight from my camp (so those “useless items” that you can’t use or don’t want to use you can sell ;) ,
---
Negatives:
---
The main story (at least to me) is Extremely “Meh” it’s only told through holotapes and computers which won’t fit well with some people.
---
If you’ve played fallout 4 you’ve seen most of the weapons and enemies (excluding a few enemies of course). 
---
I find the game extremely entertaining and this recent update literally saved the game for me, as I was considering quitting. Again if you like Fallout 4 you will love this game.
---
van lowe taxidermy top floor there are several rolls in the bathroom hung up on deer antlers
---
upvote every time i see this, the audio levels on the in-game chat and added lag compared to something like discord make voice chat in-game a VERY rarely used option
---
I just started a new character to try a pipe and wood/leather build.  
---
This is good news.
---
There's a guaranteed Mr. Fuzzy hard hat at Quarry X3 by Watoga (green pond on the map just north of it). Upon spawning there, run towards the quarry, and to your left you'll see 2 port-a-potties, and one will have a yellow Mr. Fuzzy hard hat in it (there are other colors, at least red anyway, but this place has only spawned yellow ones for me). This hasn't turned grey for me though.
---
Where is this?
---
My furious two shot Western Revolver wins any day. vats vats .. dead
---
Don't feel bad mate, its a game after all. A savvy player would be down to their undies, and would've stashed that junk as soon as possible. If anything you did them a favour by clearing the bounty.
---
I absolutely hate hearing other people's voices while I play my games.
---
Pretty time consuming to scope out market prices and adjust my own accordingly. I try to mentally note what things sold when I get a notification but  my pricing is all over the place so it doesn't help much.
---
Generally I stick to less than 30÷ of the value the game assigns and have a thing for prices that end in 69. Plans and mods move the best but a legendary item here in there is cool to see. Unfortunately it doesn't seem possible to inspect legendary items within the vending interface. That's a problem. I'm not gonna pony up lots of caps without being able to check the specs.
---
I haven't seen any power armor. It would be cool to trick out complete suits and offer for sale, but not sure how that would work without being able to see PA components as they display in the inventory. You could rename the chassis but if a buyer can't see the components it is too likely that sellers would list bogus kits. Like some modded out ultracite listed that turns out to be an empty chassis.
---
Had the same issue with this quest on my girlfriends account. The quest completed without issue for me initially, but when she attempted it - it would constantly fail.
---
I tried: Un-equipping and re-equipping the swimsuit, completing the quest in a different order (touching the buoys in a different order). I also tried keeping her character under the water as much as possible to no avail - finally I just tried to complete it as quickly as possible - not worrying about going over the debris. 
---
We tried this both in a party and as a solo player, that didn't seem to be the issue. Quest still failed every single time. There was a few other players kicking around repeating it - maybe they had the same issue? 
---
I figured it may be that I completed the quest and bugged it for her, I did notice I had 3 quests on my account, despite completing it already.
---
It finally worked when she closed down her game and re-joined in a new server. Completed first time without issues.
---
tl;dr - restarted game and joined a brand new server, fixed the issue.
---
Move your title to text and your text to title
---
You seem to learn the plan when you get it (without reading it), but since you still get the plan... you still have it. It is a bug.
---
Too many people spiking the punch bowl with Nukashine.
---
Very awesome!
---
I bought one last night from a camp probably gonna start selling them now that I know a spawn
---
I don't even know what to do. I did the 2 daily scout challenges the day of the patch, but now there's no waypoints on my map. Tried reloading the quest a few times. Where am I even supposed to go?
---
Turns out it was an Exterminators LMG
---
No, it's more the other way around. Nuclear winter is not  what would happen. In fact you would need millions of nukes to blow up in a single location to get a nuclear winter scenario
---
Just calm down, we’re only on day 3 of getting scrip, you don’t need to be at max amount by next week. From the sounds of it, it’ll just be very randomized legendaries as rewards anyway. If you’re already getting so many legendaries, you really think you’ll get multiple god rolls on the vendors legendaries? Be prepared for disappointment .
---
It's bugged when you get the modded plan it shows "known" you can let someone else borrow it put the mod then give you the plan back it won't let anyone read it because who ever holds it the game thinks they already know the plan. They will fix it but i wonder how it will go for the person who doesn't actually own the plan
---
I don't have problems finding 3* items in the wild and they are already random. So I now get to trade in 3 3* items to get 1 random 3* item. Besides, the point of the OP is that we were told we could customize not randomize.
---
I've done it is well a few times and from my experience either you get a plan or recipe and no badge or you don't get one of those and you'd end up with a badge. I think it might be either or
---
I think theyve always been there. Theater has been for sure. 
---
Theres so many closed rooms though, i get it. If they did open a new one im not sure id be able to tell either
---
Yeah, quite a few.  Got one with 2 vats traits and... something.  Seems like I waste a lot of my good rolls on them 
---
Some people get bloodied swing speed rolling pins, I get fat men.
---
it's a bug. it's how i learned it from someone who gave me it.. then i gave it back
---
You realize 10 tries will cost 25 3* items.
---
I liked it the first few hundred times I used the 2 main ones (wave, thumbs up). Now, i am kind of sick of them.
---
I do not use mics so I would love a different way to communicate.
---
Hopefully Tse lasers can spawn in so the market value goes down.
---
What an absolute madlad.
---
Yeah, regulars are the only ones I generally carry.
---
I think it's just the water depth issue.
---
was doing path to enlightenment and there was another player with a power fist. there was a firefly about 15 feet in the air and I could not hit it with my sledgehammer or vats but I watched her blink up into it and kill it from ground level.
---
Ok, that's not a big deal.
---
PC needs text chats. This might work on consoles because especially on xbox people are used to socialize. That’s not the case on PC.
---
ok seriously who the fuck downvotes a bug report?
---
Would not work if we do it, what if his inventory is completely changed a week later with good stuff, but we rated him low because it had "bad" stuff last week so now nobody visits to buy the good stuff.
---
I suggest a green-glowing aura around the camp symbol if the prices are set lower than suggested and a red glowing aura if prices generally are set higher than suggested. The size of the aura gets bigger the more "rare" items they have for sale.
---
Some people lack a heslthy sense of humor.
---
My anti armour 10mm can one or two shot most, but this usually depends on a sneak attack or vats.
---
I have a powerfist that does about 1400. Would that one tap somebody?
---
I have to talk to people all the time in rl. As a small business owner It's mandatory. 
---
The last thing I want to do when I play my games is talk more. I definitely don't want to hear anyone's voice either. Kills my gaming experience.
---
I think you should make a video of anything you enjoy. Fun should be shared. It doesn't have to have any other reason to exist.
---
I think thats it or my luck is shit but ive done it 25-30 times and thats all ive gotten
---
If you look at the road map images there is a shot of a vault dweller holding hands with someone who is not.  
---
Best guess...NPCs.
---
i noticed the theater a few patches ago, maybe it has always been there and i just missed it? But it was new for me a back then. They did remake the entire Morgantown airport interior, so it is not impossible.
---
Ps4 as well please. I have a keyboard all set up ready to type.
---
I am experiencing this myself. Thanks for putting it out there.
---
The camera has a hard time detecting items if you are moving but if you stop it can sometimes help not very useful if the thing your taking a photo of is attacking you but sometimes you need the shot
---
Sold one on PS4 for $14k a few days ago.
---
I remember seeing them the base plans like the robot chest plan
---
You're assuming he's English...
---
Why is that? I must of missed this.
---
Bethesda doesn't have a license for Fallout, they out right own the IP. Short of them facing bankruptcy, they're almost certainly never going to sell it or trade it.
---
I'm 100% certain I've come across Molerats with mines strapped to them in FO76.
---
Incredible resource. The ign map as our best resource was killing me. Incredibly difficult on mobile
---
My laser rifle still breaks 4x faster than any other of my guns. So more balancing is needed there for sure.
---
It was a joke
---
4,294,967,265 could be the amount of caps collected by the 10% fee 
---
So the joke still does not make sense
---
 I am sure someone at Bethesda is keeping a tally on the 10% vending fee and with a history of fix one bug  create two new bugs this is actually the running tally on caps collected.
---
It’s a summer DLC so we will likely see it mid-June maybe before they start releasing it
---
Believe I’ve found some in the pioneer scout camp showers , the ones almost submerged in the lake
---
That shit was funny though.
---
What in the hell are you even trying to say? What do storage options and keys have to do with the game?
---
You may have a great idea you may have a terrible idea but IDK what you're trying to suggest.
---
You may want to rewrite this for clarity. 
---
FYI with player vending FO76 has been more alive than ever. There is no need to bring life back into this game because the last patch was awesome.
---
It’s called 76market . Someone will gladly trade you  trapper piece for your combat armor piece
---
I always jump in the "gimme chat text" wagon cause i also got this problem to not be able to use mic a lot so i'm forced to play alone :(
---
Looks awesome! All that hard work paid off :D
---
Box of San Francisco sun lights aren't new. They've been in since the beginning. Just hard to find. The others are different though.
---
Nice catch!
---
I feel like it's important to mention that Nuclear Winter is going to be an arena/br type thing inside Vault 51, or at least connects to something like that, if the dialogue is anything to go by.
---
Works the same with a sledgehammer. You up just carrying around a wooden sledgehammer handle with no... hammer lol 😂
---
Thank you! I'm glad I wasn't the only one who felt that way about the interactive maps
---
Nice hate-speech their my alt-right buddy... "Nothing is true; everything is permitted" Advocating a message like this is what contributes to rape culture in the western world. How does it feel to be on the wrong side of history?
---
You have to use the prosnap camera from the Bucket List quest.
---
That is kind of the point though. That it encourages players to, long term, provide fair prices for their stuff.
---
Maybe there would be no bad rating then. Only a good rating for selling good stuff. And if you want a good rating, you better provide fair prices.
---
So I have a 1 / 44 chance of getting the ranged weapon I want.
---
I could have done without that knowledge.
---
I’ve gotten the camp fire tales tent plan but haven’t had the knife plan from there , I got mine from operation tidy
---
South of the wendigo cave near a lead deposit is a small shack under the cliffs. 3 spawn there regularly.
---
Yeah it's odd and happened to me a few times.
---
I do.
---
Found insult bot yesterday he gave me a note saying you have been insulted put that in my store for 900 caps
---
If memory serves Bethesda wanted that. It’s Sony that act like a spoiled rotten brat and don’t want to share environnement.
---
I saw fasnacht plans going for 10k I sold all my plans for around 300-400 caps each and no regrets people bought them real quick
---
The pemmican plan would be nice. Make jerky that doesn't spoil. I wonder if there is a plan for it.
---
if bethesda does anything other than scaling it to the players level they will have to change it in the following patch to do so because i can already see the shitstorm and the "im done with this / im now leaving the game" kind of posts
---
so im fairly sure they gonna make the drops leveled to the player
---
You can name anything, just view an item and the option should be there. I do it with my power armor because i have multiples and so i don’t have to pull them all out looking for a specific one
---
Stockpile a dozen of the junk ones and keep them in your stash, then just need to loot a radroach and pop over there for a quick daily turn-in.
---
Theater was there.  I don’t remember a conference room.
---
Yeah but if people are expecting fully fleshed out dialogue characters..., im wary about that being a thing compared to just settlers
---
Lucky mole mine, you maybe will have to serverhop few times, but there are tones of them if they spawn
---
Pretty sure they wont. Energy weapons can't have explosive anymore. Only projectile weapons can.
---
I am on PC and would love to play with my Xbox and PS4 friends, wish we could all play on the same servers. Xbox and PC are both running windows anyway right? It should be doable.
---
Man, I feel you, lost my Hunter's Long Coat while doing tadpole exams... I just exit terminal and puff... It was gone... Now i have to grind it again
---
It's per machine, so if you want to sell 120 items you'd need 3 machines.
---
This. On PS4 you can delist an item with one button press, I would assume it's just as easy on any platform.
---
Too bad you are talking about things you don’t know about
---
Same here! My main is a heavy wep user that uses a prime ultracite laser gat. Super excited!
---
Communist spies
---
The man himself! Thank you for enabling this, I just hope it helps people out.
---
Are there any requirements, like do I need to have finished the first tadpole quest (unlocked the backpack)?
---
Ya I find em there too 👍
---
The conference room was there. I think I went into it when I noticed.
---
I know just to the right of it I believe is some laser wire doors that cannot be accessed right now though
---
i want to laugh but honestly i don't find it funny, it's just sad.
---
You can also use the camp device for stash...
---
Getting all three of those is a task :/
---
Personally id settle on two really. Ive gone for an extractor area and water access.
---
With the vendor access don't even worry about the actual location now since they can fast travel to you :)
---
i think the amount of work to make this happen would be to much for the small amount of people that would benefit from it
---
so i wish you luck on this but i fear its not gonna happen
---
My poor anti armor mr handy blade it was really good at murdering people with bountys because they didnt expect me to chew through all their armour
---
I’m on PS4 tho. :(
---
I think most of the ride has to be in the pic. I took a pic of the croc on the platform in front of it and got the sign and croc in it. If that still doesnt work, it's probably just a typical Fallout glitch. I crafted the crossbow bolts 2 or 3 times before I got credit for it.
---
FFS
---
If they  don't fix wood armor and we can get one stars out of 3 star purchases there will be riots.
---
.. because they called you an exploiter.
---
Impossible to do. They have stated that numerous times.
---
Far too successful on their servers. That why we have limits on budget and stash.
---
They just need to reduce the travel costs to camps by a lot. I don't mind traveling around but it's annoying if the stuff is over priced.
---
A 3 star legendary toothbrush wit Ss Aa +1 strenght
---
Same issue with the fireflys at the Lighthouse, can't vats them with my pitchfork no matter what I do
---
Anyone willing to help me with the swimmer badge? I just need to revive someone in shallow water and Im done with the tadpole badge. Im on XB1
---
Don't worry the guilt will soon pass but you will yearn for that euphoria of the kill again and soon thrusting a knife into someone will feel no different then slicing a tato and a raider is born.
---
Meh. my shop, my rules. If I wanna sell all my bears for 25k caps that's my prerogative. You don't want to buy them? Feh on you then! Some other lucky S.o.B will snap up these highly collectible and totally rare 25k cap bears then!!
---
Filthy casual here.  Never use it.  Also on PC where aiming isn’t a pain in the butt, so there is that.
---
I mentioned this too. Imagine you are a level 15 and saved up the rare legendary drop for scrip. Finally make it to the vendor, buy a 3 star melee, and its level 50. Lol. Rage!!
---
Did you get your power armor back?
---
It was the only plan I didn't get and some kind soul had it listed at 50 caps.
---
I bought 1.5k worth of junk from them because everyone else I saw listing it wanted 2k plus for the old man.
---
Before the nerf, it was an excellent counter to Assassin Sentinel sets. Not really necessary now.
---
Textchat is not only for communication. Text-Roleplay needs a Textchat. It's pretty mandatory. This game is perfect for  Roleplay, but has no Textchat. See where i'm going with this.
---
He was so happy with the uodate he wanted somethibg to be salty about
---
Blackpowder already has a pair of Bayonet mods, just a heads up. The Large one is *enormous* and I bought a rifle with the increased bash damage property just to best suit it. Don't even need to carry a melee half the time haha. Love my musket ❤️
---
Yea. I originally had a 2x2 garage where the lake met the land but I couldn't place any foundations in front or behind it to fit a store. So I just demo's the garage.
---
The porch from the house I extended to a 2 wide porch to build the store off that and have a few tables in the aisle with an outdoor bar. Store on the first floor, benches on the second, rooftop dining on the third.
---
The floorplan didn't go to plan and there was one wall and a bunch of spots on the roof that weren't snapping. After a couple hours I just said fuck it and destroyed it.
---
Got rid of the extension to the porch and left the house as is. Then I rebuilt a 2x2 garage in the same place but pushed it further back to leave room for a 2x2 store in front of it where you see in the picture.
---
Not what I had envisioned for my store/camp but I like the way it looks.
---
What? They only have one bayonet mod and it’s a regular one
---
If we knew? No, those of us who lived through the time knew. There were plenty of reports about how many seconds after impact you had to live (measured in seconds where I grew up) and what mechanism would kill you (eg heat versus concussive force). Northeast air command was an hour away by car, but the nuke that hit it was going to get us too.
---
Uh..../s?
---
It's not a big deal and you do get to customize your weapons because you can choose the weapon type.
---
I like the idea of a gamble it will give you a better chance at getting an OP weapon without everyone having the same OP weapon.
---
I dunno Mamma Murmrgh seems like she'll be nice so probably something like "I got Murmrgh's favours!".  
---
Then again I never expect anything good, so getting stuff from random loot systems is generally a pretty happy experience for me.
---
Thank you, thank you.
---
And I apologize, that's my marketing departments way of getting the word out there.
---
Yeah, I guess I'm not the only one.
---
I wasn't even going to go for it just yet.
---
The challenges to get it would have been easy enough anyway.
---
My joke or your post please say your post it's to early in the morning to have my feelz hurt.
---
Lmao this didn't cross my mind you'd be stuck with a weapon you can't use for a crazy long time.
---
This ain't Uber baby!
---
Yeah, I'm disappointed by how this is working. I'm happy to roll stats on weapons, but *specific* weapons. As a shotgunner, getting an OP legendary rifle is no good to me. Again I'm posting days and days of 'want to buy' specific guns, while trying to offload what I have while staying under caps cap.
---
I was hoping, *really* hoping she would sell random modifiers - like, an item which, when purchased, reveals which three effects it would apply to a weapon. If that makes sense.
---
Yea, I just bought a 3* instigating explosive .45 pistol for 1k
---
Is there only one? Mine says "Large Bayonet", assumed there was a small. But how is that not a "Long Bayonet" like you're suggesting? It's already like two feet long 🤣
---
&gt;Dupers: stop fucking with our servers!
---
What if they need more dupes to sell them on ebay ect? Do you think they would care if on other hand they can get money.
---
I just took a fresh look, it's really amazing what's being sold there. Even flux. 40 times each flux, sells for 30 dollars. And the price just keeps going up and up. I mean great weapons and armor, maybe nice PA sets. But even flux.
---
Seller like that, doing little bit "work" with a computer at home, is selling thounsands per month. If they would know about what you think, they would just laught.
---
I think the method I saw mentioned, was so complicated people just wanting to dupe a little something, won't bother with it. But if you want to sell items for real money, you need constant supply and that requires duping.
---
I suppose there would be similar number of people playing it as survival. The needs it'd satisfy are commonly expressed within the community. Since the servers are 24 people anyway, its rather easy to get the "full" experience.
---
You could always contact the author and bring your thoughts :)
---
You are absolutely too kind. Thank you!  But I am on PS4
---
It's part of the game and has been since the original Fallout.
---
You know, alot of these questions could be solved with Google.
---
Plague Rider(pestilence), War Rider(war), Black Rider(famine) have asked us to come and see.
---
Now we await the Pale Rider(death)
---
If you were to remove all of your .308 rounds from sale, would it then clear both slots, or would the 1 still be permanently full?
---
Do the big bend tunnel, recycle every weapon (there are workshops in there), use the recycling related perk. I got 450 last time.
---
Thats a good find. I honestly love the fact that people lower theyr prices at the machines since you need to go out of your way to go to the camp.
---
But u found time to make a ironic answer but ignored main question. That’s smart
---
Hey, clicking my mouse a few times while gun fu and vats select and kill my targets is hard work I'll have you know.
---
Wow...that is harsh!!! Funny, but oh so mean.
---
Why is no one posting pictures?!
---
I kinda show off with leaps of faith as well, my faith in Serendipity seeing me through, it was hilarious leaping off of the lighthouse 4 times to help a friend with the helpfulness badge, and I "dodged" the ground each time!
---
On one of my four vending machines I’ve got the word “TIPS” spelled out in neon letters. Inside, it’s like 10 random holotapes in alphabetical order, correlating with increasing prices. It’s absurdly priced intentionally in case anyone just wants to tip me. Prices are 250c, 500c, 1000c, 2500c, 5000c, 10,000c. Then the 15k, 20k, and 25k are vintage nukashine. I know it’s ridiculous, no one has tipped so far
---
Cargobots don't leave photgraphable corpses/wreckage, so killing them never works, just a heads up
---
I price most things at 30-50% off retail. I seem to be making a more steady profit than some of the other players I've gamed with who are charging normal or higher caps.
---
Especially if it's something that doesn't leave a corpse you could photo instead. Like Bee Swarms, or Cargobots
---
Call it the "Grave Digger"
---
I've seen them there and always wondered what they were doing off the edge of the map like that. You might be on to something with that theory though, nice thinking
---
I admit this one ticked me off. I know it's not huge, but they promised the game would could be 100 % solo and then locked back packs behind multi player. That's bullshit.
---
1) Many don't participate in trading communities and may not know what it's actually worth or doesn't need it and wants quick caps. 
---
OR   
---
2) It was duped. There is at least one method active post Patch 9.
---
Envy you! Couldnt get a hold onto one but have a Legacy Gatling Laser and a TS/ +25% fire rate / faster movment - Gatling laser
---
was crused back then to hear that the Ultracite Varianty has no Legendary.
---
SO FINGERS CROSSED! :D
---
Username betrays your true intention here my friend. Puffthemagiccommie? Heh, nice try not falling for the bait.
---
Lol Whitespring still get looted, new world boss at the sheepsquatch event... You don't know what you are talking about haha
---
Im new too, had it 2 weeks all i can say is that it gets even more fun.
---
Not at the moment.
---
The only way to obtain it is as the quest reward.
---
No, but Super Duper has a chance at working.
---
I’m not sure they can do that, then players would use vendors as General fast travel spots for world travel. If anything, make train stations cheaper.
---
Finding unfairly priced stuff is the worst. Which is why I say the game needs a way to show players who the fair vendors are.
---
I am in the last part o the main quest. Almost everything else.did already. I'm out probably after this. The game have literally 0 endgame. No purporse to invest my time again. Why? To grind better weapon? To do what? Fighting the same enemies over and over......there is no point.
---
YTA:
---
You decided to express your anger on a neutral third party, causing property damage
---
It’s vandalism my dude. YTA
---
Fair enough, I'm on ps4 if you ever decide to trade
---
The problem with bloodbuilds is not in bloodied. Its in the fact that automatic rifles score four bloodied crit shots within one AP bar thats problematic, and the crits are 2x.
---
The right way to balance crit after sentinerf is to make it an official, visible parameter of the weapon and receiver. Automated rifles would still be awesome if their crit modifier was reduced from the constant 2x to 1x or 1.5x. The armor penetration effect of critshot would still make it super deadly, but before the sentinerf I could kill four assassin/sentinel people in one magazine, and now I guess I could take down 6 of them if my position was right.
---
Bye now
---
Look for the new river gorge sign, that might do it
---
3\* weapons are a 40% return when scrapped back into scrip so at least it's to a complete lose if you get a bad roll.
---
Both of those are very good points now that you bring them up. I might be a little too stupid when it comes to duping because i honestly forget it even exists most days.
---
Yeah, but you also need the hacker perk at 3 and a special skin for the excavator.
---
If the owner of the camp is there. Then you can inspect the item. If they are not. No inspect
---
If the person is in their camp you can. If they're away from the area you cant
---
In my CAMP.
---
Very convenient, between those and the molerats I always have a snack handy :P
---
Theirs the possum one that costs 3 badges I wouldn't recommend getting just got it [possum backpack ](https://imgur.com/a/vI7Ao85) 
---
Just one color different than the [tadpole backpack ](https://imgur.com/a/17M30zq) 
---
I think the  atom shop one looks the coolest out of the 3
---
Tamed creatures are considered part of the camp and aren't damaged by other players. Had a shithead come to my shop and attempt to kill my mirelurk and provoke me into PvP. It just kept walking around and they did no damage. Brahmin are a different story as even you can kill your own brahmin.
---
They didn't try TSE. Everyone goes how they are great and shit. Yeah TSE handmade is great, if you have 10k 5.56ammo
---
I’ve been finding I can’t use vats on flying insects for some reason
---
Wait how can I get the excavator in black? Even though i have several power armors this is the one I used the most.
---
Oh cool didn't see this mentioned anywhere. I was too much focused on backpack :D
---
its a paint in the atom shop +) and the best thing is it is only 800 atoms
---
Didn't think this update would make me giddy to find a cheat sheet for a fuckin' ingame exam, but here I am. Thank you so much for this!
---
Yeah, it's been happening since the official game start last November.  I used to think it was me running into immovable objects like branches or pointy rocks.  But I've had it happen many times while strolling down a paved roadway.  I sneak a lot - maybe, it's related to moving in the crouched position?
---
BGS has done good so far to reduce its prevalence.  Exponential growth doesn't appear possible with the new method, so we've got that to be thankful for.
---
I don't have the PLANS for the frog not that it didn't work
---
Yeah i was just thinking it should be in the centre of the map since it the most densely populated. Can you share any locations with extractors and water access please?
---
It's a shame that the Sheepsquatch club, Sheepsquatch club and the Shepherd's crook are not on the list.
---
Bruh...radtoads give 2-3 fluids for the mothman event an they keep spawning in triplets.
---
Uh - you never know that might be some high level's alt character - show up at the low level's camp, and be surprised to find max level 3\* legendaries for sale.  So yeah - don't be too quick to judge.
---
There’s only the original normal bayonet. The one I’m suggesting would be larger, probably like an actual knife bayonet. Where’d you get the mod for it?
---
Correct. I think this is the point most people are missing. It's still far better and easier to do this then to have to find enough legendaries to hopefully get the right drop. Plus you can likely still pick up low * at most the game vendors cheap and the 3* God roll ones people find are easier to buy now that player vending is easier. 
---
All around, getting the weapon you wanted is going to be a LOT easier now than before.
---
I have scary stories immediately after the release of each new Patch.
---
*Cries in Junk Vendor*
---
To avoid spam/trolling, it could be a requirement that you purchase before rating. I've grown to love some of my "purchases" and loathe others
---
Every PC game has text chat, it's so stupid that they left it out here.
---
If it can compete with my rank 3 perk card I may use the backpack and stop using power armor.
---
A Heroic Llama indeed.
---
Viracocha smiles upon you on this day, may His blessings be plentiful.
---
They posted the scrip prices for the vendor. Total RNG but you chose between mele ranged or armor.
---
Excavator for utility, T-51b for ballistic and energy resistance, and X-01 for radiation and energy resistance.
---
They not a cargo bots there.
---
You on PC?
---
Try doing imposter sheepsquatch solo :D
---
Good spot, but you cant photo them from that distance
---
X01 because it takes lots of damage and "keeps on ticking."
---
&gt; Events are often geared towards multiple players, ruining it for individuals. I.e. Summon the Mothman. Getting 50 fluid in 10 minutes solo is damn near impossible
---
That mission is ridiculously easy.  There are *sooooo* many fireflies and the radtoads also drop the fluids.
---
\*Spoiler : According to the data mines, it's tied to the upcoming Nuclear Winter
---
Yeah, i noticed a lot of people i met who duped kinda stopped playing because, as they would always put it "Bethesda sucked all the fun out of the game". Never made any sence to me how duping was fun, but whatever floats their boats.
---
I know right....sometimes I have issues getting vats to choose the super mutant in my face rather than his buddy 20 feet behind him. The struggles are real.
---
At least now you can crawl over to the Station and exchange those garbage 1* legendaries for Scrips.
---
around Christmas I saw a guy with a bounty out in the middle of nowhere I had nothing better to do so I snuck into his house and beat him to death while he was on a workbench. I checked his bag and realized it was full of flux like alot of flux over 400 each. figured he was a duper so I stole it and started fat sneaking away he respawned and was also overweight prob because of all his dupped items on him I hid in a bush with my chameleon gear and watched him walk past I gave it a few minutes then server hopped. ended up doing the moral thing and made several hundred fusion cores and gave them to players around whitesprings.
---
My friend however did something really scummy. he was looking at the map and said 2 players near watoga had almost the same name. I told him its probably a guy transfering to his alt account before I realized it he fast traveled over there. he hid behind a tree watching one guy dropping a bag and the other account sit there afk when the guy dropping the bag moved he ran over and hit take all on the bag got a ton of weight then alt+f4 out of the game. he didnt leave the game normally so it didnt autosave his character so he basically deleted someones bag.
---
Fallout is my most favorite game on console, because i don't have to aim every time i meet some mob.
---
There are a few primo CAMP spots too that you only get to by glitching or slow exploit moving further than you usually could reach up to even with marsupial or jetpack.
---
I need to see this
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
And how would the system reflect that they have learned and changed their ways? They have a bad rating, so nobody goes there to see the change, so nobody gives them a good rating. The ratings either has to decay, or only be based on the last few weeks ratings. Otherwise nobody would ever get a second chance.
---
You can join me at sativa aussiex01
---
To be honest i'm really not worried about the scrip costs at all...
---
I've been saving tons of 3* junk items, especially those with 90% weight reduction. Currently i'm scrapping the heaviest ones to free up as much stash space as possible.
---
Also, if you're completely out of junk items you only need 30 1* weapons to reach the daily cap...
---
Why you think any weapon have price over 5k? People pay that much only because they are scared, that someone would buy it out before them.
---
Sigh....haven't even seen a decent explosive weapon being sold. I have gotten a few good deals but not like that.
---
Unfortunately not likely with CAMPs but some of the data mining and assumptions based off things said pre-release and since lead us to believe that "shared world" workshops might be a thing at some point. So that might be the closest thing to a marketplace possible.
---
Thank you! Ive never spent any atoms since i started playing anyway
---
Can I get a ruling for scattering nuke mines all over inside someone else's base?  Asking for a friend...
---
*convert time : 3am* Oooh :( Was hoping to come, it looked awesome :(
---
I think there is incentive to play together. The problem is that the Fallout franchise has always been a single player experience. And majority of the fan base prefer to play Fallout single player. 
---
I’ve played 76 around 250 hours, and teamed up once for nuked Whitespring. I just prefer single player.
---
Thank you and all that helped with this!
---
Well depends on your extractors you want. Try this link
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/
---
Theres a map in there someone made
---
It's not a feature, just a bug.  That's why it isn't mentioned in the notes.  Players discovered it while trying to figure out why sometimes you could inspect and sometimes you couldn't.
---
I frequently use VATS when I'm trying to pay attention to the story / lore. I can't say I necessarily consider that casual vs a different gameplay focus. 
---
When I play with other people, I sometimes notice the extent to which people who weren't paying attention to the holotapes / didn't really read terminal entries / etc spend a massive amount of time in frustration, trying to figure things out via trial &amp; error.
---
No unfortunately I’m on Xbox
---
That would be my guess.
---
Can’t you use the vending machine as a stash?
---
I heard that too, but if ones here there maybe more,maybe a quest to set up nuclear winter who knows.
---
Drank out of one last night
---
Nostalgia
---
ok thanks
---
Did you read my comment? I literally agreed with you that the “bad” rating was a bad idea and said there should only be positive ratings
---
T-60 for me purely because it’s so cheap to repair
---
If they don't, I do! xa0t1ca on PSN (middle o is a zero)
---
you dont feel anything when slicing a tato but strapping someone to a chair and slowly peeling their skin off will give you quite a rush
---
Plus if you don't like what you got, sell it back at 40% +/- (we haven't got a 100% confirmation if things like charisma/hard bargain might get any attention with this trade but currently appears not to) and roll again.
---
Shit, I bet your one of those Carebear casuals that plays with your monitor on.
---
Get on my level, son.
---
I play without visuals or sound.
---
haha lol
---
Ive seen sellers start the prices at really high prices quite a bit. The sellers usually know the price and quality of the weapon they are selling. For instance the Vampire Explosive Shotguns ive seen sellers start the prices at 15k-20k or for trade for legacy weapons
---
Not sure what that reference means but I've made some great friends through the chat alone, and daily/weekly challenges are so much more fun when teaming up with them. Plus this new update makes it 10x better for all the camp and shops stuff, plus the pioneers.
---
General’s steakhouse. Romping with the super mutants.
---
....Where's the sign? (Thanks for replying)
---
Put down a painting, then use the letters on the painting.  If you ever need to move the whole sign, you can easily.
---
My gosh someone must be salty they either didn't find that on sale for themselves, or sold off their's off for way cheaper.
---
Pipe revolver is the best pipe weapon. Good damage and faster firing speed than bolt action. Additionally you can put a rifle stock on it and use both pistol and rifle perks. The major issue has been that there are no legendary pipe revolvers.
---
Nice I used the railway and a trash can
---
On the either end of the bridge I believe
---
Yes. The other 20k is spilled on the ground for the devs who didn't survive.
---
There are hoods in this game?
---
Not on Consoles, only pc...
---
did the imposter sheepsquatch event people were dying all over the place then at the end when it died it exploded and got 5 other players down at the same time
---
I can safely say, you will not be missed.
---
Buh bye
---
I had my mule set up in Clarksburg. Stuffed my machine full of low level gear and decided that if I'm selling low level stuff i should move down into the forest.
---
Now I'm outside Slocum Joe's.
---
Then if it's a Dev room item like I suspect you will probably never get it
---
Just do 1 Revive while in water, ticks both boxes.
---
On console you just use their loggin name and send a message. Tell me how to do this on PC if my friend is offline  🤔
---
Good to know. Thank you!
---
A good question. 
---
For trivial like glass ect, Im going by 1c. Springs if I have a lot, I would like to do 2.5c, but have to set 3c. Asbestos and antiseptic for 2, since that's what vendors pay with proper boosts, I can take the loss of tax. I don't personally see like adrehesive so uh, important. I usually have plenty and might have been sometimes selling it or vendors too. Aluminium I've seen asked often too, I don't know where people can use so much of it.
---
Hmm I was talking about my selling prices. I would maybe just need to buy things like gunpowder, and even 1c might be a bit too much. But can't go lower with vending. If I have too much lead I can't burn off because of lack of gunpowder, I would just directly sell off the lead.
---
When I need it, I could buy cloth about 1c each. I might need acid but I've never brought it so don't know what's proper price.
---
I've never gotten to the fireflies event when it has more than 10 minutes left. That's definitely not enough time to kill 50 fireflies. Do the math, or did you skip that in grade school? You would have to kill them almost instantly and continuously for 10 minutes straight which is damn near impossible as a Melee character. plus, it's geared towards multiplayer because this is a multiplayer game so why the hell should you have to always do it solo?
---
also this is not supposed to be like any other Fallout game. It was designed to be multiplayer so people would team up together. That was even their entire marketing scheme. Don't you remember the video of where it said it's more fun to play with friends and they had a bunch of people running together shooting everything? most people play solo, and the game is based towards multiplayer, so it naturally feels like crap and that carries through with the leveling. Holy God damn boring 😂 you have to do every multiplayer event and multiplayer activity alone. nothing is challenging and you can kill everything instantly, which makes the grind even worse where as in previous Fallout games you could actually modify the difficulty. you're not going to convince me of anything. Sorry that you can't take criticism of your precious game
---
My rule has been if its level 50 it’s 1000 caps per star. I base it off that. Selling a level 45 1star 700-800.
---
Bought it from a Vendorbot 🤷 it said Large Bayonet in the title, and when I inspect my rifle, and seriously the thing is *really* long, like seriously two feet. Makes the rifle much taller than my character 🤣
---
better dead than red!
---
I know right?
---
Not that it's real problem but this gets me thinking, I seen a vid with some guy who had traps and stuff set up with switches
---
Is it possible to hook up an airlock so to speak, say switch that opens door one and closes door two, then another inside to do the opposite. We could all remain open to all but also closed
---
I wish we could set up camps closer to other players. Then the travel costs wouldn't sting so much.
---
Or I want a pre-designated spot in whitesprings for everyone on the server to set 1 machine. Then I could go there and hit everyone up.
---
Do you really understand everything they said? All the tables with IDs and though things?
---
It's possible the purveyor doesn't have a scrip pool, so anything you buy at her shop won't return the scrip to scrap more legendary items on the same day. It's not showing on the screenshot on the lower right corner like caps does at normal vendors. 
---
But maybe anything you buy at her shop does refill the scrapper at a % (like 25% for cap trades).
---
To avoid spam scrapping your good items I name an item ** ABuffer so that it gets scrapped instead. I have already gone through one of them accidentally so it works.
---
Happened to me too. I got a Possom badge for every tadpole badge I got.
---
No people are just dumb. I bought VE handmade for 4k. And when i was wanting to sell it. People offered me 15k caps + 3 bloodied melee weapons.  Like wtf? It is not even 3*.
---
Don't buy weapons that are overpriced!!
---
I just did it and there were no toad's the last two or three times I tried it. Checked around back, they don't run up anymore. They're just missing completely. Another thing bugged maybe along with everything else that's constantly messed up?
---
Yep, your just a person who needs to complain about shit.
---
So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
---
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
---
Goodbye!
---
Never. Take. Starched. Genes. Off. Ever.
---
I get that. But when I think of multiplayer game I think of multiple people playing together. I don't like solo play. Who comes to a multiplayer game to play it alone? Plus all the events and activities are geared towards multiple players doing it together....
---
Defense events for lower level workshops. You'll get 10 in no time.
---
Small 5% or so increments would be an option to see how the servers handle it.
---
There is no need to save legendaries if you farm daily you have enough stuff to grab caps from vendor and scrip from machine everyday, to increase chance for good legendary you must use all 5 characters you can have on fo76, this way it's 5000 scrip.
---
Yelp isn't a thing in Fallout
---
Yeah if I remember correctly there’s no other bayonet mod unless they added it in the new update. Did you purchase it from a traveling vendorbot?
---
Still haven't figured it out either
---
So when you realize that you don't have any reasonable or logical argument you resort to quoting The sound of music? I guess that's a tasteful way to say that you are bad at formulating any logical reason behind your argument. this game is heavily flawed and the reasons I've stated are exactly why people don't come back to the game. But keep living in your own little world and pretending that this is the best game you've ever played.
---
It sometimes amazes the amount of shit that ppl have in this game. I would be suprised if I reach 50 scrip and here there are people worryi g about a 1000 scrip limit. Insane
---
"There's no incentive to play together!"
---
"The event is impossible to solo!"
---
Get you s* straight man!
---
Very bugged
---
Stingwings and bloatflies really could use a shorter respawn, if you're listening Bethesda.
---
I will cleanse all the filthy bloodied players with my rad shower
---
Ok awesome. If I keep good with salts and use the mod I’ll never have to ditch spoiled food. Good to know. Thanks
---
The shotguns and handmades are different weapons. Thw handmades vampire effects only work for the one shot that comes out of it. The shotguns vampire effect works for every pellet that comes out of it. The shotguns with the vampire and explosive effects are worth alot more than the handmades with the same effects and almost anyone will tell you that.
---
At about Lvl 80, I kicked off this event without reading any discussion of what was going to take place.  I figured I might be able to complete it solo.  Checked the map and there didn't seem to be many people around early in the morning so I activated the computer signal.  Before I even got to the second pylon to "light it up" more than a dozen other players appeared out of nowhere.  Everybody was shooting at everything that moved and it appeared that only a couple of them knew that all three pylons had to be active to turn off the Squatch's shield.  Died several times; Squatch went mostly unscathed; lost my black titanium and ultracite loot in the "disappearing death bag" scenario.  Haven't attempted a repeat - purchasing the Recall Card is too bloody expensive, anyway.
---
It was the most urgent problem because people are not buying repair kits from atom shop.
---
You can kill the fireflies in 2 mins. They spawn according to the rate you kill them. Easiest event in the game.
---
Try the Sheepsquatch or Free range.
---
Edited my last comment for more clarity, sorry, realized it was vague after I hit post lol
---
Lol true that
---
Some random buy made a bad camp by whitesprings by just stacking the metal staircase floors going up 5 flights of stairs an in his store he was selling nothing but lv 1 boards at 25k each.
---
This. I just automatically downvotes these threads now.
---
Oh nice!
---
Okay so if you are melee how in the actual f are you supposed to kill 50 fireflies when you have to actually run over to them physically........ also there are no red toads. I've completed the event multiple times and never seen one no matter where I went. It's obviously bugged
---
Lmao armor plating
---
They fixed over repair bonus (by removing it) and now this helmet gives 1dr 😂
---
kinda off topic op, but is there some kinda refrigeration unit we can place in camp coming? or was is this backpack mod is was talk about?
---
he got you a new pet :)
---
I've started running out of things to do, too. Leveling up my other character is painful.
---
found a super mutant in my locked generator room half buried in the foundation like he dug into it. he was slowly punching my fusion generator when i found him.
---
T60 because brotherhood
---
🤦 there goes my Ripper, my BuzzBlade, and my Chainsaw
---
Sony spoiled it and even if they hadn’t, I don’t want to even imagine the absolute shit show Bethesda would cause by attempting that. the though is terrifying.
---
Save this, nuclear winter won't have VATS available.
---
There are many .50 cal receivers.
---
Tons of things in 76 weren’t a thing in fallout before.
---
It’s an entirely new type of fallout. Players having stores to sell to other players is entirely new.
---
"It'Ll MaKe ThE gAmE mOrE uNsTaBlE."

Power armor always returns to you, you don’t need to worry about it.
---
Heck, even putting random npc's in game would be sweet.
---
-roaming raider
---
-trade caravans 
---
-settlers
---
-non feral ghouls
---
They don't even need quests to begin with. Just have them roam around.
---
I think the new ever upward quests and badge mechanics will open the door for faction quests and ranking.
---
-responders
---
-raiders
---
-bos
---
-enclave
---
-vault tec
---
-free states
---
-mothman cult
---
-etc.
---
Xbox but thanks for offer!
---
It's the same game you played before, on slightly better servers.
---
More people than are responding this far are thankful, such as myself, for your efforts here.
---
One question - can the resolution of the maps be improved, or is my viewing platform (phone) the problem?
---
Can’t play now but if you still have them on sale maybe around 4:00 pm we can trade?
---
There’s a refrigerator coming that’ll be sold in the atom shop I believe. That’s what the data miners have stated anyway
---
I have worse problems with scorched and super mutants. Occasionally the occasional ~~dog~~ mongrel(s) and mole rat.
---
Sometimes, a scorchbeast.
---
I always have my headset on and ready to go too but just can't bring myself to use it. I can't talk to people in the real world either most of the time due to anxiety. Text chat is usually ok though, I socialize more in ESO than IRL. I'm obviously all for text chat in FO76.
---
I feel you mate, pressing Q and click almost simultaneously is a hard task.
---
Personally, I don't think it's even 50/50. 
---
Current 3* drops would pick any random item out of the 3* drop pool, not based off armor or weapon subcategory but out of individual item potential drop rates, similar to loot in a container. So this puts every single item into the pool individually each with their own independent drop rate. 
---
So basing that on existing loot pool tables, you have about a 60% chance of getting a "common" item from any items in that pool (leather armors, rolling pins, pipe pistols, etc) then about 25% chance at your uncommons, 10% rare, 4% very rare, 1% ultrarare. That 1% ultrarare would be that same level of drop rate that the Fastnacht masks and the preserved pie drop at. 
---
Again, This is basing it on loot drops by rarity not by type but as this hasn't been released they could have an entirely new algorithm for the legendary RNG as it relates to this vendor.
---
That's guided meditation you're taking about at the temple of the winding path.

Path of enlightenment is the one at the light house, where you kill fireflies to summon a wise mothman which gives you a 2h XP bonus gain.

Xbox’s OS has Windows 10’s core but it’s heavily modified, so not the same. But it’s definitely doable, other games like State of Decay 2 have done it. It could be done with Playstation too, but they refuse to play ball.
---
4pm est? im in GE so at  least 6 hours ahead of you but i should be on.
---
Wow you essentially want to black list player vendors because you dont like their prices , if you dont like someone's prices dont buy anything. They will realize that they aren't selling anything eventually and adjust their prices accordingly
---
me no need vocabilary to sound good me only need few words get point made
---
No forest scout? 😥
---
Legendary Urban is Huge
---
VATS doesn't work with heavy weapons and they deal the most damage. But they require PA which can't be legendary atm. Still emergency Protocols is pretty good.
---
But you're clearly talking pvp which is shit in this game anyway lol
---
They don't stack.
---
They do alert you....?
---
4 pm CST, sorry not able to convert right now I’m in a hurry but if the plans are still for sale later thanks!
---
Do you want another feature that allows the game to play itself too? try Mountain, you don't even need to aim, because there is no one to shot :D
---
I shit on people's beds if the CAMP front door is locked and/or the prices are too high.
---
This one time I saw a 1-star nocturnal combat knife for about 3k-4k. I broke into that house and left a ton of oil, acid, wood and fertilizer on the bed. But not enough to be useful.
---
Bye bye
---
see you later
---
Scout armor??
---
Our stank makes us strong.
---
The maps are 4k*4k resolution so they should be pretty clear. I understand imgur does some compression which unfortunately I can't control. I wouldn't be surprised if your client is downscaling them though, but yeah to have any higher resolution would exceed imgur's file size allowance anyway
---
Cya, you definitely won’t be missed.
---
Is there any info on what the new type of game mode is?
---
They removed the bonus damage from Over-repair, which was literally the only way to make the Chainsaw viable beyond the earliest levels. So yes, they actually nerfed *all* the V Fast category melee weapons (drill, Ripper, BuzzBlade) because over-repair was the source of almost all their damage. Now they're back to mostly being trash. So sad, I loved mine.
---
How about this one:  [https://i.imgur.com/Zen6znF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Zen6znF.jpg)
---
I think if he's an assassin, he'll rest your case for you....
---
I got 1 strength and im okay. Could not sprint without PA before patch.. bit now with legendary scraping, player vending.. im total okay playing with 1 strength
---
Plus you will have a tasty snack afterwards
---
I’m sure players would still visit a vendor that didn’t have a great rating. And as a said in another comment, maybe the “bad” rating is a bad idea. Maybe it’s just a rating that is tied to the amount of stuff you sell. The more you sell the better of a vendor score you have. 
---
I’m fully aware that the market will self adjust and people will have to sell at fair prices or not sell anything at all. All I suggest is the game have a visual representation of how successful a vendor has been.
---
Anything that says diseased has a chance to drop legendaries.  Pretty sure that's what you are seeing.
---
Thank, were trying atm
---
Lol. Or any mobile rpg, thar have autoplay :D
---
Rad toads spawn down the road. If they aren’t coming after you, you have to go over and check. It’s not bugged, that’s just where they spawn. If they don’t detect you, they don’t pursue.
---
Also, use basic explosives (grenades) for this event.
---
The game tosses grenades at you all the time, use them here.
---
If you were having trouble wrangling all this stuff... why you you use melee? Change your approach.
---
Maybe you don’t like that event, that’s fine. The Sheepsquatch event happens all the time, and is challenging, and provides a unique reward set.
---
Free range operates the same way.
---
Mine didn't at first, had to change servers and wait for the location name to pop up in the camera view finder
---
The default yellow arms look sick with the Extractor paint
---
ok, and? is it good? nop it sucks.
---
If you do this for fun, that's just being a dick.
---
If you do it because of high prices or something, good for you.
---
make sure it says (stash)  when transferring I built In a premade location and have a garbage bin next to my shop that was there before I built my camp and its not a stash this wont happen alot though
---
Looks good.
---
Have you considered doing some for mob spawns for farming parts?
---
If you walk up the hill from the fast travel point you should see a pioneer scouts symbol, i think on a sign to your right as you're walking up to the building.
---
Fyi- the second quest waypoint is in the basement, if you get stuck after the monorail like I did.
---
I've found that since the vending update I've had loads more attacks on my camp than before. Don't know why. Had to completely redesign it.
---
I get your point 100%. It was just a questionable decision to make a Fallout multi-player game.
---
Was in the area that the map showed to kill a stingwing.  There is a tree with stairs to the top. Found one in a tool box on my way up.
---
That’s fine, won’t stop me from using it. 😊👍
---
I've never tried to swat a mosquito with a crossbow, but this is what it must be like.
---
Happened to me yesterday at Seneca Rocks, creeped my partner the hell out while I watched it slide across the ground towards me 🤣
---
Same but in the game I also have no friends.
---
Listen up buddy ! Im also old &amp; slow and i die once per 50-100lvls !  I never use PA , you just got to kill em enemies before they kill you 😁👍 how old are you btw ?
---
An assassin has no name. An assassin is no one.
---
You are just tripping over a root or something. Hell I trip over nothing all the time in real life. It's that extra Bethesda realism. Not a bug but an undocumented feature.
---
I really haven't looked into that. I'd probably need to consult some xEdit pros about exporting mob spawn data. But once I had that, Mappalachia could map it no problem. I suppose watch this space.
---
No springs required to repair legs=winner
---
I'll do 5
---
I actually want this to happen tbh cause I already know I plan on getting it again once it comes out on Steam.
---
Could be because the explosive shotguns have a dramatically decreased damage output since this last patch. 6k seems pretty fair to me.
---
had that happen yesterday it was really scary because all the ghouls chased me outside and they didnt ragdoll when they died so it was had to tell what was attacking me
---
The scariest thing about wendigos is that they can walk. Creepy walk, with both 2 legs.
---
A bit like SCP-096.
---
I tried to buy something from you yesterday and then you camp disappeared. It was sad
---
To answer you question : Straight dmg mitigation perks a more important than armor resistance . Perks like lone vanderer , blocker and so on
---
OK, then it’s got to be my platform. I’ll try on the desktop later. Thanks for doing all this hard work man. Maybe you can map out where I can find a TSE hunting rifle now :-)
---
That sign might encourage someone to be a dick.
---
PvE &amp; PvP are both implicit in the subject, but still, VATS is shit, and I am not even talking about implementation I am arguing that it shouldn't exist in this game.  
---
The best excuse people put is " it exists from the first FO, people, first FO wasn't even created by Bethesda, it works 100% different and it was nice for the kind of game it was, this VATS is an absolute nightmare.
---
That should help some people, but the places I said are all guaranteed spawns not possible spawns.
---
Bethesda games are too bright. Even in Fallout 4, I installed Darker Nights and it did nothing to alleviate the issue. It didn't even work.
---
Well I have to give it griefers, they do adapt improvise and overcome
---
I was going to reply re-read the patch notes. But there’s a bunch of replies for that. So yeah. Doesn’t work in pa. It’s not a bug.  I’m sad too.
---
As long as it doesn’t increase lag I don’t see a problem for having the option.
---
Or the coal paint.
---
I do feel the fast travel cost can be a bit excessive, maybe refund or reduce travel cost if you buy something. Like a bussiness in real life that validates parking at a cheaper or even free price
---
Go on...what about the sheepquatch weapons that he asked?
---
I would kill for a legendary pipe revolver. Literally one of my favourite pipe weapons.
---
I got this accidentally at Encryptid from reviving players, it's a good place to get this
---
Oups yes.
---
I make mistake in my translation.
---
Up until now we've been selling to vendors for Gamestop prices, gifting to low-levels, or just throwing the shit away. How is a 10% cap tax a problem? It's like taxing lottery winnings.
---
I was wrong, vats is perfect for you.
---
Yeah, thats fair enough. But even without any shotgun perks this thing does 157 damage.
---
Your best bet is to try to accumulate as many 100s as you can given random nature of what you may acquire- if seeking 3 star weapons. 1 or 2 star combos will cost less.
---
Crying?
---
Pretty sad this is how they operate. It’s total amateur hour over there.
---
Thank letting us know. No need to return here then ever again. See ya.
---
I assume, if there's something worse than 76, even launch-wise, they'll either move on to it, or keep Fallout 76 as a punching bag.
---
I honestly don't know why they'd keep 76 as the class punching bag. I honestly don't know.
---
And all of this?  
---
Because the Internet *loves* stupid drama.
---
Pointless drama about, I don't know, Kylie Jenner getting another plastic surgery? Let's fucking go dude!
---
This is just the general attitude of the Internet. Even Odd1sOut recognized that the Internet loves incredibly fucking dumb drama.
---
I definitely think it’s worth getting it right now. I’ve been playing since launch, and this update thus far has been my favourite as of right now.
---
Psn MrsSnugglyGeoff
---
This started happening to me long before Patch 9.  First noticed it back around Patch 7.  Started to happen every time I tried to access unprocessed food items (berries, fungi, etc.).  After Patch 8, it's been pretty much a possibility for any kind of item in the Aid inventory.  Not seeing any improvement after Patch 9.  In a 4 hour gaming session, I get 2 or 3 lockups.  Worst of all, after Patch 7, I am no longer able to kill the game with Windows 10 Task Manager.  Have to cold restart my system to clear the problem.
---
You must be one of the scrubs getting killed in PVP with VATS. I guess you're a little salty you TSE weapon isn't as good as you thought.
---
Yeah and my Gatling gun is pushing 280 with the same amount of perk points devoted to heavy guns as shotgunner.
---
conVATStulations :D
---
Well, a couple things to consider. Any good roll you get is worth something, even if it’s not useful for you personally, particularly with all this player vending going on. But more importantly, the legendary vendor essentially just gives you free rolls on legendaries. Youre spending scrip that you get from legendaries that you’d otherwise probably just sell to a vendor for like 5 caps. Even if the odds are crap, it’s all gravy.
---
I predict that we will see a lot more good guns in player vending machines once this comes out.
---
I never even knew greed worse than EA existed.
---
I never knew Star Citizen existed.
---
*"existed"*
---
A refined receiver does more than the base damage of its standard receiver. Why should .50 be any different.
---
Not sure what it is that is causing it.  My camp has been in the same location for quite a while and the other day I had Liberators attacking my and destroying my fusion generator.  I have never seen Liberators at my camp before.
---
That's...even worse. Which is, incidentally, what everyone in Division 2 is experiencing right now. There are talents in that game that appear to be weapon-specific (only SMGs, only LMGs, etc). So they are a bit weighted, it seems. Nobody knows how much, except the devs, and it looks like not even they do. What's the problem? Problem is, last week's weekly challenge is to turn in 3 weapons with Unwavering talent. I've been playing all week, every day, doing all of my daily challenges. I did all the weekly bounties. I cleared the weekly invasion. All in all, I didn't slack off in the slightest. For the entire week, and so far 1 day of the following week, I found precisely ONE item with Unwavering talent. Many of my clanmates, who played more than me, found none.
---
That's the problem with RNG in general, and weighted RNG in particular. It appears this talent, along with many others, is "rare". 
---
As it applies to Fallout 76, people are getting Ghoul Slayer's Gamma Guns. Do I need to explain why that is bullshit? There's screenshots of this weapon, and many others, that are just as useless.
---
And while Purveyor will use categories, it won't let you specify. As far as I know, it'll be melee/ranged/armor/etc. It will not allow you to specify Handmade Rifle, for example. So, right there, if you are searching for a Handmade, and you pick Ranged, what are the odds there? 1 in 10? Meaning, even IF they are weighted to be twice as heavy, less than 1 in 5 guns will be what you want. And then you need to roll 2-3 stars? Good luck. I mean that.
---
Also, I kinda wanted to address it last night, but it slipped my mind. People have this weird binary mentality when someone like me rebels against the tyranny of RNG and calls it bad/lazy design. I'm not asking "Give me what I want, right now! Full, flawless set of items within 1 hr!" NOBODY is asking for this. But what I am asking for is "Pull back on your RNG, or give players agency to modify items directly." I'm OK with *some* RNG, just not near-total RNG, which Purveyor will still be. Out of the 5+ rolls on an item (archetype, type, 3 stars), Purveyor lets you control one, the archetype. Beyond that you're still at RNGs mercy, with no customization options.
---
Compare that to Elder Scrolls Online. There is still RNG. You still need a certain set item (Burning Spellweave Staff) to drop. That's still RNG. It is also one of the more egregious examples, in that game, because if you are looking for a Fire staff of Burning Spellweave, and not Frost or Shock, it's a 1 in 3 chance. RNG again. But it's 1 in 3, it's not 1 in 23. The item also has a trait, which is 1 in 8 roll. BUT you have the ability to change that trait, and not via RNG, but precisely targeted. That is, you go to a workstation, select item, select trait you want, BAM, done. BUT, this costs special crystals, which are only obtained from dailies/dungeon bosses/few other activities. Meaning you can't just transmute the entire set, it'll take a bit of work to transmute it if the RNG was unkind to you. But just because RNG was unkind to you, with transmutation, the item is never inherently bad. Furthermore, in some situations, items drop in different qualities, your standard white-&gt;green-&gt;blue-&gt;purple-&gt;yellow. And where in a game like Division, purple == bad, now and always, and you are chasing ONLY yellow, in Elder Scrolls Online crafting system allows you to take a green and turn it blue, then purple, then yellow. For a price. Price being rare crafting mats. So you *try* to get your item to be gold as it drops, but if you can't, or are unlucky, and get a purple, or even blue, it's not the end of the world. It just means extra work that is STILL RNG (the odds of getting the rare crafting material to drop), but you can also buy those from players. 
---
In short, in ESO, the terror and tyranny of RNG is ameliorated by a toolset to dampen it. The toolset isn't free or cheap to use. It STILL takes time to get a full, perfect set. But it's a ***REASONABLE*** amount of time, and you are virtually guaranteed that you will get it. Whereas in FO76, it is entirely possible you will NEVER, EVER, EVER generate that perfect weapon for yourself via RNG. That's my problem with it.
---
Good thinking! They could also blueprint that whole structure if they wanna just store it when not in use
---
They even said before release that you could build close to friends so you could make an settlement. But it was bullshit
---
I'm not that lucky. I've done most of the tadpole ones minus the bugged ones and the ones that require revives. (I only need a revive to beat the tadpoles.  And I've only got 1 possum token.
---
I like VATS because of the critical shots ;)
---
Had to leave and do other stuff, I add you and see if we can do it another time
---
Ive got a decent gatling gun but ive been wanting to try new weapons and i think this is a good weapon to get me into shotguns and rifles.
---
Yeah I also noticed I have one protected marine plan, and I haven't learned it. I will probably sell them too, just got to go and find okay looking price for them.
---
Im personally not so intrested in those(underarmor plans) since I can just buy any shielded underarmor from trader straight away. I mean suppose now with vendoring it would be easier to go into crafting business with them, very trivial in fact, but it would work a lot better the more different things you have, and crafting them requires a bit of flux, and I've really not been a super fan of farming flux really. I've though just pick up all junk, stims and ammo I can find, sell off some to keep stash with little extra room, and play as usual.
---
Like previously I've occasinally picked up one stars and tried to sell them. And managed to, few, but it's just overall been so tedious and labourous, for so little reward. I've just done it more like to help those players who still can use one stars, as once you get high level enough, they just don't cut it well. But now with vendoring, as I get some room off my stash from the useless 2-3 star legendaries I've collected for Purveyor, I could pick up some nice 1 stars, keep them on sale for a while, then drop them to vendors if they won't go.
---
I've been wondering why my Bos technical data seems bugged as I have some in my stash but it won't trigger the quest. Or maybe sometimes technical data does and sometimes doesn't. All I remember there's something weird as I can pick those, and put them back again.
---
 Well, I don't know why, but as I was advancing trough the old military training base with the automated bot training course to get to the new pioneer scout starting place(or Lowe quest place, I can't remember anymore where I was going,  but I had to travel there as I didn't have closer waypoint), it showed me a quest text in the middle of screen "fort defiance has high tech security plaa plaa I need to get military ID to plaa plaa". Then I check, I now have recruiment blues quest, and it's telling me to do the 3 training courses I've done ages ago.
---
Yet the drill sergeant or whatever boss bot, addressed me as having completed it all, and game me the military papers. I mean it's a small bug, but if it prevents me from getting any rewards from technical data, uh, not funny.

There are some that arent for pure damage but also crit damage and precision or recoil.

Same name as your reddit?

This. Every time someone spawns to my camp they bring enemies with them, and they almost never kill said enemies. I come back to a destroyed generator and a mob of enemies milling around inspecting their handy work.

Just a heads up, almost all headgear now has 1 DR, even hats and stuff 👍

So ... not to give anyone ideas ... but this will only escalate. I can see it now ... dirty pillows and teddy bears ... handcuffs and swimsuits ...
---
Sure, I’ll try if I get another card by then, I’ll add you soon
---
Happy Wanderings!
---
Yes, I merely reinforced my point and added an alternative for the possibility to keep negative ratings too. Sorry  if I came across as argumentative. I only tried to provide more thought to my first post.
---
You are doing Atom's work!
---
Don't know but have noticed that after Patch 8.5, I pretty much stopped getting auto-Stimpak support from my auto-Stimpak armour.  Wrote it off as just being out of Stimpaks and didn't check.  Two days later, I finally did check and found I had 75+ Stimpaks in inventory - and I'm dying every time with no auto-anything assistance.
---
All I’m saying is they’ve done an injustice to shotguns, they should be putting out much more damage then they currently are. It just doesn’t make sense that an automatic heavy does more dps than a shotgun.
---
I used to use pipe for the stacking perks, had an explosive bolt action and just reg maxed pipe for close range was awesome .. but it appears they changed and pistol/rifle perks no longer stack with them around the time they reduced the licensed plumber perk from 90% &gt; 60% .. unless it got changed back I haven't checked recently
---
Did you use VATS to comment this? or tried to press the keyboard by yourself? in any case grats, you are a better than the rest for that comment.
---
I just want 1 explosive weapon
---
It's in the screenshots I think OP made a mistake copy/pasting it.
---
That being said, that’s a great find and I would buy it in a heartbeat if I found it at a vendor.
---
Great to see the F...ing Drill &amp; Syringer not on the list, they need to remove them as legendary drops completely, I got another Syringer off the SBQ last night, and that Pisses me off to no end.
---
So torn about wether to spend my hard earned atoms on the Black Rider, or wait to see the last one. Anyone know if it's been datamined?
---
Same here
---
I am on console. I just want an easy way to recruit other players and form relationships within the game. The games launch was too rocky for me to convince any of my friends to buy the game and play it with me. I need a better way other than silly icons and following people around to get them to group up for content. Plus porting around the map can also be a serious cap sink at times already. Being able to text chat the whole server would fix that issue. If you don't want it then they could give an option to hide the window. THIS GAME NEEDS THIS FEATURE!!!
---
What’s the restart option?
---
It could exist as a probability in the regular shots too, as in every single rpg that have ever existed (or almost that i've played).
---
He might not be Xbox lol
---
Nobody ever uses area chat on PS4. I’ve heard like two guys in a month. And they were just breathing.
---
Yea. I always figured the cool down was shared.  But if they DO stack, then 5 of them is 97% chance to not die.   Idk. Seems like a niche thing, but still interesting
---
If you don't like it don't play. Tons of other games you can play. I'm sure plenty of people still play call of duty or if you want some adventure you should try The Last of Us. Fantastic story.
---
I actually enjoyed those very much because of the whacky humor. The DMV one is supposed to be a drag to poke fun at the actual DMV.
---
But I guess you'd appreciate more quests like "Bring 10 Yao guai pelts to generic npc bot"
---
Ugh no way I’m trying to reinstall right now. Is it possible our character got banned? It’s weird because only one (and of course my main) character is unable to join. My other 2 have no issue. 
---
Agreed, if they can’t get my 186 character back I’m done. Which sucks because I seriously love this game.
---
Huh, that's weird, I was able to finish this yesterday with no issues. I snuck up on all my critters and snapped the photo when their name popped up in the top right. 
---
Maybe do a hard restart on your system if you're playing on console?
---
No I'd appreciate actually going into the world and completing fun challenges. Smartass.

Hey I found him at whitesprings! When you go to the main ft point, he's on the red car just out front of the main entrance https://imgur.com/Al2Rs3h.jpg

It’s from Assassin’s Creed. It’s a video game reference!
---
That overseer may have died prior to the vault sealing or very early into the experiment though.  Which is why they chose to use the ZAX system to direct the vault dwellers.
---
What ever word it is supposed to be has to be a noun that begins with a vowel sound and is related to how humans act while in a group outside of normal circumstances, and also be related to the fact that the dwellers are being directed by something not-standard.
---
The most obvious is some position of leadership, which is being replaced by the "experimental" redacted information.  We know ZAX exists in Vault 51, so if the ZAX is the answer to that, that would suggest that the usual role of direction authority in a Vault is what is missing, and point toward the first redacted word being the Overseer.
---
I haven’t either. I’ll have to keep an eye out for verification purposes.
---
I'm currently watching chernobyl and my feeling is "if a nuke goes off in a nearby country everything is over" haha

You legend! Now for that Aluminium deposit CAMP
---
It's broken logic. 
---
"VALVe deserves that 30% cut!" yet they are the guys who shat out Artifact. Real money, actual real money you could get for curing cancer, playing games, etc.
---
"Bethesda doesn't deserve to take away 10% of the caps you get from another player buying stuff in your camp!" Fake, ingame money. Not able to be bought, only achievable ingame by adventuring, events, or selling garbage to a vendor.
---
Fallacy? In the Internet? Who would do such a thing?
---
"Damn it Mr. Anderson, now we will have to hunt you down and plug you back in"

Found Ansel at whitesprings! He's on the hood of the red car right outside the main entrance, at the main fast travel point :)

No way, I want to sell things without being seen on the map. Just store it if you don’t want people using it.
---
Hey. Who knows. Maybe Beth will actually put some thought into it and weight good stuff more heavily than bad stuff.  That would likely still make it very hard and slow for getting “super good” equipment.  But Atleast it would be better than essentially every roll being trash
---
Build your camp by a road between two successive quest objectives.
---
2-3k.
---
Same here. I used to get the occasional attack when I went back. Getting them all the time now. Can clear them out, and in 5 or 10 mins another load attack. Wonder if they're attracted to the vending machines?
---
Duuuumb
---
Walk into it. That's the whole point.
---
It's been like this since forever... Standard .50cal is the best receiver. 
---
Made a post about this one month ago, nobody cares.
---
Itsa good idea..but its gonna suuuck your tine away from the game.  Every time someone buys or you put a new item in ...gotta update. Personally i dont really mind the not veing able to see stars all the time. As a buyer i feel like sometimes people wont buy because they cabt see the 3rd star..then i come in and it lets me. I found 3 cav/sent pieces yesterday for super cheap. Albeit..one was a 300c gamble cuz i couldbt see it lol. Either way though..they should patch t his so you can just play the game not sign maker lol
---
Wait till you find the secret passage...
---
Nope
---
It wouldn't be need for this if X button will work on all the items - sometimes it works and you can see exactly what are you buying, but sometimes it's not - I didn't figured it out yet what's the case here...
---
No
---
Most likely will get some info or more leaks after project paradise.
---
Lol, no problem
---
Why are you so upset about it? There are people who don't like these exams and people who do. Obviously both positions are valid and bethesda can't magically make quests to suit every single demographic at once.
---
When they first allowed Brahmin to be milked they always gave milk (subject maybe to a cool down period). However I think it was patch 8 when that stopped and they didn't always give any.
---
Hahahahah godbless the free market. I would not buy at those prices. People are selling better rolls at cheaper prices.
---
This one time (2 days ago) I got a quad explosive combat shotgun. I modded it to the max to see how it was.

Bad. Couldn't even 3-shot a ghoul from close to point blank range and a sneak attack.

It was explosive so I thought to raise the price by 100 caps, and the next thing I know, it was on sale for 1 day, and a just-turned level 50 bought it. I'm a melee build anyways, but that thing was a pretty good drop, and the first one I've gotten that was in the "pretty good" class.
---
Think so. I normally only check for weapons and armor there. Happened to click on the plans and they are all there. Calibrated shocks, jet pack, the lot.

Hello! Geospatial Information Systems Specialist here. Have you considered utilizing AGO environments and running the system as a web application by sorting the information into a Personal File Geodatabase? Would be a fairly simple process once the raw data was completed and the scale/ resolution is there. This would be a constantly online map that you could toggle legend items, zoom, and even analyze the data. You could also convert those points to heat maps which are generally easier to see at that scale. It would take a bit of time, but If you have the complete dataset, I'd be able to work on something to help out.
---
The overRepair bug has been in the game for a long time. It was just conveniently fixed the same time the repair kits were released on the Atom Shop.
---
Yes, I have an item that is not normally obtainable. Not duped, glitched or from a Dev room, merely an oddity that existed early on but no more.
---
Oh good point but I still don't figure out how I can use blueprint system or my function is just broken haha.
---
I can voice my opinion freely my guy. Not sure why you care. I simply don't like test taking especially not in a video game. Plain and simple.
---
You can get the entire suit for free by reading a terminal in the science wing I think, that’s how I got mine (the plans anyway) don’t waste the caps
---
Sorry, my friend .
---
If the player is in thier camp you can see the effects. Who knows how long a patch will take?
---
On bottom-left side of RobCo sign the is small tour speakerbox - if found it accidentally while doing AWOL event, but I didn't progressed enough, so it told me to come back when I'll be posum ;)
---
How do we get daily quests?
---
YOU DAMN KIDS!!!!!!
---
Yesterday I was away from my camp and got a message from another player that my fusion generator was destroyed.  Got back to my camp to find a bunch of dead Liberators.  So not only was he kind enough to let me know my generator was down he also killed the bad guys.  There are a lot considerate people in the game and some not so considerate.

---
&gt; * Heavy Combat Armor Left Arm (Bugged in data as Heavy Robot Left Arm)

What does that mean?  That you get Robot instead of Combat?  Or vice versa?
---
It doesn't bother me much. It's just "part of the game". It's Bethesda's game, the way they made it. If I don't like playing it that way, I don't have to play it. In fact, selling stuff is not even part of the main game, it's just a fun thing added in much later because the fans wanted it.
---
While I still gripe about crashes and weird anomalies, they really happen so far and few, that it could be any game that I'm playing.
---
As far as communication goes, that was kind of forced on by the community, we demanded it because they weren't providing info. The key thing to take away from that though is that they actually listened to their customers. They provide detailed logs and updates and news now. They provide udpates with things we, the customers, actually want in the game, things that weren't part of their vision or plan. They're shaping it to the way we want it because we love the Fallout IP so much as fans.
---
I keep running into people every week saying "oh yeah.. blah blah the failed Fallout 76..." and I have to stop them right there... No, it hasn't failed. It's alive, it's got major improvements, it's a pretty awesome game. Sure, day 1 had lots of issues, but so does everything these days in the rush to capitalism and deadlines. But for the fans that stuck by, it's simply an awesome game that keeps getting better and better.
---
We're so used to what's in FO3, NV and all the capabilities of FO4 that this new dev team is having to learn that what we want to play is based on the excellence we expected from the other games.
---
Charge me a few caps to sell something? I really don't care. Isn't it all arbitrary anyway? I mean seriously... I lose 10 caps on a 100cap item.. boo hoo. Just spend an extra few seconds playing the game you love to collect more junk to sell to a vendor and make that back within seconds. They're trying to build economy and this is how it starts. I'm going to play the game regardless.
---
i'm confused, were you **not** making a dig at bethesda?
---
It is literally the description that it deals more damage.
---
there are exactly four .50 receivers
---
.50 =&gt; Converts Ammo
---
.50 Precice =&gt; Better Hipfire
---
.50 Critical =&gt; Better Critical Damage
---
Based on the wiki stats, these three all had the same damage before the update, but different additional bonus values
---
.50 Refined =&gt; Better Damage
---
This one should have more damage than all the others
---
So, it seems like the .50 (regular) was buffed to a new value, while the others still have their old values. So the new base .50 is slightly stronger than the old Refined .50
---
Currently playing Division 2, and text chat there is magnificent. Including accessibility options like Text-to-Speech, and Speech-To-Text. I often had issued in Elder Scrolls Online when doing hard content, someone says something in group chat, but I don't notice right away. In Division 2, I can set it so that it actually SPEAKS when someone types in group chat. And the software is relatively sophisticated, it says "smiley face" when someone types :) , and so on. Though it still says "see why ay" when someone types "cya".
---
And yes, we absolutely need text chat. Especially since you can always simply CLOSE THE FUCKING TEXT CHAT WINDOW if you don't want it. 
---
Also, since the game is pretty heavily loot based, and they clearly want us to trade, being able to link items in chat would also be awesome. WoW, which is 15 years old, implemented this I don't even remember how far back. So did ESO for 5 years. So did many of the quality modern games.
---
Making your way in the wastes today takes every cap you got...
---
Its not the suit, its plans for the mods for it.
---
If your on ps4 i will give you 5k if your selling I need a good weapon for my alt.
---
I have a wall in the center of my second floor that can't be removed. I have taken everything down around it.
---
I agree it's going to be a time sink. But I feel better if players know what thier getting. 
---
It's good to know people don't mind not seeing the effects.
---
I'll buy 3* weapons at 300 just for the 40 scrip
---
it was literally changed yesterday.
---
before that the basic .308 was better, while the .50 had a better ammo crafting efficiency
---
Always a shovel in the Big Bend train tunnel.
---
It doesn’t work like that.
---
You are my hero ❤
---
Don't fail me boneclub!
---
Probably the railway rifle?  Extremely cheap ammo cost must make for a very high Damage to Cost ratio.  And I think they are affected by rifle perks.
---
1 in 100 chance of getting any particular type of armor, some random legendary effect.
---
Had that happen to me in the toxic valley.  I looked over and thought what the hell is that. Killed it and saw it was a feral ghoul. Creepy.
---
One of my favourite pastimes is looking for players in a static location for a while, and travelling there to creep around and spy on them. I kept leaving this one guy random aid items and junk and he got quite skittish over voice chat lol.
---
Fallout 76 is the class punching bag. 
---
The Internet loves stupid drama, and has quite the herd mentality.  A rather bad one.
---
If a few people group up to pick on a random thing, you can get maybe even 1/4 of the Internet to come with you. Even if it's a fallacy-ridden trip, they'll come anyway. I highly believe the love of stupid drama is the source of some (if not most) of the Internet's problems. Not 100%, but it definitely is at least partially. And also the herd mentality.
---
Exactlt. Its a win win at that price..now same time..u wont catch me spending 5k on a gamble. Worse case ill sebd a message asking for star description
---
I think it is actually luck based. My friend is running a VATS-build with lots of crits and stuff, and thus have high/max Luck, and he has no idea what I am talking about when I say that I can't always milk. He always gets milk, and lots too. Maybe it is luck if the cow has milk or is dry and producing?
---
If you go to relay tower EM-B1-27 near Flatwoods and vault 76, when loading in, run to the station and go right until you run into a large tree stump there is another one near it. (Could probably see it from the top of the station) it mentions reclamation day, so I am currently searching for a 3rd one at or near vault 76. I haven't found it yet but I have found like 3 cultists shrines that I have never seen before.
---
Have you tried reloging into the game? That fixes random ghost tiles for me but I did have an actual time glitch out and couldn't be moved or removed. I ended up fixing it by scrapping my whole base blueprint when moving locations.
---
Wrong. Standard 50cal receiver was always better. 
---
Here's my own post, from 1 month ago with screenshots as proof.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b6id2a/hunting_rifle_50cal_receiver_mods_bug/
---
The damage was buffed yesterday, but standard 50cal was better even before that.
---
Yeah you have to make sure the name pops up also the animals or whatever can be dead
---
I saw that one, didn't need it.
---
That's a good idea or a please come back to your camp so I can see your legendary effects
---
&gt; As a shotgunner, getting an OP legendary rifle is no good to me. 
---
So sell it.  Or convert it back to scrip and try again.
---
Huh, didn’t know that. That- in this specific case- blows :/
---
Y'all're filthy heathens! Just because the world ended doesnt mean hygiene has to die too!
---
You pay the wahmen in full power.
---
Full power!
---
^(unnecessary marko vanhanen reference)
---
I shake my head at gamers in 2019 having to specifically ask for this, and most of the time still not get it. I think back to 2003 and EVE Online. It had so many basic systems (chat, mail, logs), mind-boggling 16 years ago. That are STILL missing in a multiplayer game in 2018.
---
Where exactly was this cuz I'm pretty sure I'm standing in the spot and I don't see it
---
No, it's not the case - yesterday I was lucky to buy 3* Bloodied Handmade for 8k and the owner wasn't there (I would definitely thanked him ;) and I could see that stats. But only for this awesome weapon - other stuff he was selling I couldn't see so I've passed. If the owner is in the camp you can at least try to ask him about the stats, but not everybody has a mic.
---
Armpits and asscracks FTW.
---
The snallygaster spit attack?
---
That sounds like a Family Guy joke.
---
You can do both at once, yes. Don't drown yourself, it is hard to impossible to revive under water, you just need to be in water. I revived my friend in the large puddle outside Charleston station were she was standing knee deep dropping a grenade at her on feet, and it counted for both the quest and the swimming challenge.
---
One thing that I have to assume is possible (with a little extra work), and that I've actually gone out looking for on a number of occations, is a map of all the crafting benches and PA stands in the wild.  By type would be nice, but more than anything I find myself (on frequent occasions) wandering around with 200 lbs of junk over my weight limit, looking for the closest place to scrap everything.
---
Also, you and the guy who makes the interactive map (fo76map.com) should get together and combine forces.  (and no, that site doesn't have workbenches either :P )
---
Gatling gun
---
I mean you right, shoulda just said human NPC, but you got my point lol.
---
Nevermind I found it
---
Looks like my inventory.
---
Fuck.
---
I appreciate that you finally fixed the .50 Receiver.
---
/r/Valseek could you tell the Devs that next time they should change ALL OF THEM?
---
The Precise, Critical and Refined variants of the .50 still have the old damage value. The Refined one (which should have the highest damage) is now weaker than the basic one.
---
Only the Basic .50 was buffed.
---
Notice that urban is twice on the list.  Maybe a typo, or a bug from Bethesda.
---
No most of what they say people wouldn't understand since we only play the game and don't understand a thing they are saying but we might get some words we will understand like skins, armor or NERF
---
You made my theory before I did mine. You said it better than I did. 
---
Fuck me.
---
Looks like the SBQ found the G spot
---
This is super annoying! Hope it gets fixed.
---
For anyone still stuck with this I have the solution. After talking to the robot the quest will appear under the daily quests!
---
Yea I know they can be dead, the glitch wouldn’t count photos of anything living or dead. Had to fill up my photo gallery before it started counting
---
Yeah, I've got to know about it by reading on of the add on trading subbredit that guy is crafting them. I know him and he's not lier, so I reminded that they fixed the vendors and decided to check it myself and indeed ended buying shock, jetpack and hud plans.
---
So it's the same grind, just with extra steps.
---
That is super annoying :( hope it gets fixed
---
Ate you on PS4?
---
Impressive! Thank you. Any chance of a map with canned dog food/salisbury steak locations? :D
---
This would be funny if you had the Free States flag thing next to your name.
---
It sounds like a budget/bootleg Free States propaganda poster.
---
You can get snallygaster and behemoth ranged affects by interacting with them when they shoot you.
---
I'm down wing.
---
Okay, that was a tasteless joke.
---
But, \[citation needed\]
---
I read recently that dataminers found it doesn't spawn in deathclaws, but you find it on gulpers instead. You can also find it in deathclaw nests (there's a few at the abandoned waste dump in the mire).
---
Damn...where's my legendary protest sign????  :(
---
Yes!! Omg OP thank you! I’m so glad I’m not the only one!!! Hitting bloodbugs is a fucking NIGHTMARE with this bug and I thought it was because of my stupid knuckles!! Yes yes 1000x yes I’ve had this annoying ass bug
---
Plus they are ingredients for the insect repellent recipe you get for doing it.
---
I just got a quest from leader Treadly asking me to get scorchbeast ADN i went to that place killed the scorchbeast and didnt get anything then server crash and i lost the quest i m not sure but maybe it trigger after killing scorchbeast+queen
---
I did see a post of someone saying they were doing this. They were luring enemies to people camps and leaving. :(
---
Railway rifle
---
Lock the door, it’s a fallout thing, that even bugs can open unlocked doors. Players that travel in would just be triggering the local enemy spawn point
---
Does it protect you like hazmat/pa in nuke zone?
---
Good find Bloodied Handmades are great weapons. Are you sure they were not AFK in chameleon armor I occasionally do that. 
---
I've passed on some potentially good weapons because I couldn't see the major and minor modifiers. 4K on a gamble is a tough choice.
---
Haha i guess we never expected games to be so realistic.
---
I believe the name The Fear would be the perfect name for that mutation.
---
We'd only need stealth camouflage.
---
It's just an in-game mechanic, mobs spawn when someone FTs or approches the camp. Before, it was just you spawning them (or a random player walking past), and that was easy enough to handle. Now, mobs will / might spawn whenever customers fly in to visit your shop. ;-)
---
TL;DR: Your customers attract the beasts, not your vending machines. But it's the vending machines that attract customers, so the difference doesn't exactly matter.
---
😂😂
---
Anyone doesn’t have to be a teammate
---
High DPS and with Ammosmith you can craft 180 5mm at a time
---
you'll be at level 30 in a day or so....save your caps. i'll build you a non legendary one to what ever specs you like for free i'm on PC my name is my name
---
There are 2more lead lined and insulated. Didnt seen any info about them.
---
I had some one a few days ago that kept requesting my main weapon on my Aid Vendor Character, Twice i backed out of trade and gave the "No Way" emote, but they persisted, so finally i priced it at 10k, it was a level 5 TSE reduced weight Pump SG, my aid vendor is a level 6 character and needs this to defend herself, so I obviously didn't want to sell it, but the person bought it for 10k, gave me a thumbs up and left.
---
Yep. Don't forget that you can retrieve your ammo from corpse.
---
Ah, the not PC curse strikes again.......
---
oh i thought you meant of all the Receivers, including .308.
---
I havnt played since release, so i only remembered that the 308 was stronger than the 50, just not as ammo efficient.
---
Maybe that's where I got it from to. The tent is nice at least with its different color design
---
Don't you feel filthy using it? don't you feel handless? each comment proves me I'm right and VATS is for casuals.
---
I hope that you didn't make up "fell into his deathpit" so you wouldn't get "YTA" as an answer.
---
No. NTA.
---
BOS combat armor
---
“Fire from the nuke blast run hobo run!!”
---
“Devils in the wasteland of the rising sun!”
---
Reviving any downed player satisfies the quest. They don't have to be a friend, nor do they have to be in your group.
---
Excellent. Thank you.
---
Weapon artisan. Gunsmith, and the attachments you put on them
---
If you play on a PS4, download the messages app. 
---
I believe there's an Xbox app that's similar. 
---
I guess the tradeoff for pc players is that they can use mods.
---
A patch or two ago they removed the 60 damage, 60 energy, and 60 radiation resistance points that the Power Armor Frame added to our Power Armor sets. 
---
You can still use a naked Power Armor Frame and get the 60/60/60 bonus, but when once you put Power Armor pieces on the frame you lose the 60 damage/energy/radiation inherit to the Power Armor Frame itself. 
---
Combine that with the fact that they removed the damage resistance boost from having any Power Armor piece repaired over 100% and you have a fairly clear idea why Power Armor feels way weaker now overall. 
---
Most of my Power Armor sets lost anywhere from 100-200 damage resistance. My level 45 Excavator now has the same stats as my level 25 Excavator had in the B.E.T.A.
---
try aiming at the waistline and using 3-4 shot bursts instead of holding down (or spamming) the fire button.
---
Your accuracy/hit rate will improve and ammo consumption will drop.
---
The only reason you're complaining about it is because you scrubbed out of PvP. Why should you care if someone uses it in Adventure mode?
---
For me, the big surprise was the caps cost and craft cost of Recon Sensors
---
My melee shows 95% chance of hitting...but most of the time it won't let me swing, so I've just had to kill them the old fashioned way.
---
Well, if beeing afk in chamelon armor removes your dot from the map then yes, it's possible (I've looked for this after buying weapon to thank the guy, but it was only my dot on the map there).
---
Exactly the same - I've bought also 3* Instigating /limb damage/something Ski Sword for 2k, but it was gamble - I've decided to get it anyway, since I got 2* inst/40% power attack bonus, so new one was better anyway.
---
I've had issues with my pip-boy disease timers being very inaccurate lately.
---
Ugh me to!
---
It's on the actual bridge friends.  The East side.
---
Got a nice level 50 AA swing speed super sledge for 1500 yesterday, and a ghoul slayer explosive the dragon for a 1000. Seen some shadier prices though, like serums for 5000 etc, but most people have been really fair!
---
as someone who is anxiety ridden, i dread having to pick up and toggle on my headset for strangers, i was forced to do this the other day to ask a guy to drown himself so i could revive him and i'd do the same.
---
needless to say after the ordeal i straight up logged off after saying thanks.
---
whoever thought of this mic or emotes only system has never suffered with crippling fear of interaction :/
---
\[PS4\] I have the Snallygaster Spit Explosion Attack for sale 5K caps
---
It is surprisingly reasonable. This week's Inside The Vault has more details. It's 100 scrip for a random three star weapon, 60 for a three star armor, or 65 if you wanna gamble on a three star weapon or armor.
---
Yeah being "hidden" while crouched will remove your dot from the map.
---
So the other two are at River and fork if that is the tower one maybe?
---
Any idea where i can get a swimsuit? I can't do the test
---
Yeah, i noticed the serums in vendor shops have been insanely priced lately. I saw one guy selling them for 25k each. Complete insanity.
---
I feel you bro, I’ve been baby-sited by my high level friend since I started!
---
FUCKING LOVING every minute of it!
---
ok, so that can be the case:)
---
This.
---
Looking at it, first thing I'd say is ditch 1 point of commando/expert commando for Master commando, it'll work out to be a 45% buff instead of 40%. I.e. 2 commando, 3 expert commando ,1 master commando.
---
Also I'd personally swap out the rad resist if you want to keep using ghoulish, and or swap out ghoulish for something else. I'm a big fan of the sun kissed perk, which gets rid of rads during the day. 
---
Hope this helps, not really sure myself what else to add or take from it!
---
Assassin is only saught after in the context of a combination with sent or cav. Typically assassin alone is fed to the scrapper.
---
One tip I have is that you can invest perception points into the third commando perk at the cost of just having concentrated fire rank one and not three. I usually find one level to be enough and the perk boosts vats accuracy only a minimal amount on automatic weapons (i think single digit increases as opposed to double for semi-auto)
---
Possibly. There is a creek near vault 76 wouldn't call it a river; and I'm not sure about a fork, uhmmm maybe it's like a dirt path fork.
---
Wow.  What a fantastic resource.  Thanks so much for the effort, all.  Bravo.  :)
---
I can’t justify selling anything for more than $4k so even my 3*s are $3000-3700 ish
---
Weapons you are seeing are from another method.  It is really simple, not the craft 18k items, that is why are seeming them in bulk because require materials and doesn't crash servers.
---
From what I've read, it's not a whole lot more than flipping a switch in the code (but I'm sure that's rather simplified).  The issue is licensing - and Sony doesn't like to be reasonable about that.  I don't know if it is just money, or if they just object to crossplay for certain types of games or certain studios...they've done it for some things, but others can't seem to get the agreement in place.
---
Dragons have te highest DPS per shot I've seen, and you cant get much cheaper that a single .50 cal ball....
---
Hardened 308 was 2 points of damage better than the refined 50cal. Since the refined 50cal had the "improved damage" flavor text people just assumed that it's the best 50cal receiver.
---
Meanwhile the standard 50cal was always just as good as the hardened 308 (by points of damage), but since it lacked the flavor text it flew under the radar. 
---
Now all 50 cals receivers got buffed. This also means that the standard 50cal kept its 2 points of damage over the refined one. It's exactly what you observed in your own post.
---
Does the fridge mod actually work well or no
---
Is vault 51 the one in the NW corner of the map?  I visited the location but it doesn't show up on the map as discovered like the other ones do.  Unless they fixed that this patch.
---
I just put up a sign saying
---
Message me on Reddit with any questions
---
user; mpstr1nger
---
I can justify me putting a couple things at 7k max. I had a bloodied explosive gauss rifle that i put up for that much and not even a half hour later it sold.
---
Yeah, I did. I would love for this pioneer scout stuff be the beginning of a ton of cool new faction based questlines and dailies. Maybe even some more faction specific armor or weapons.
---
Mine have not changed, I have Yellow, Red, &amp; Blue ones on my collection keeper character, and sold 2 yellow ones from one of my vending machines last night.
---
I wore one of the yellow ones around for a day, and it was displaying as yellow, so it may be a platform specific issue, I'm on Xbox.
---
I wish I could but with the camp budget being so limited and items for sale in vending machines taking up budget space, I don’t have the budget room. I’ve already had to break up parts of my base to put stuff in the vendors. Putting up signs would cut my base in half, easily. I usually leave my character crouched in my base for a couple hours with an elastic band around the right thumb stick to keep me from being kicked for being afk.
---
Dolly Sods is a location in the Mire.  There's a Pioneer Scout leader robot in the ranger station who gives you the quest.
---
Yep ive done it all😫
---
New dupe method doesn't cause a server crash.  You do it over and over again and then go play in the same world.  The lasers have been in LFG also.
---
&gt; /u/Thalenia you're wrong. There are 44 Range weapon + Syringer - Pipe revolver. 43 Meele + Drill. And 35 Armor (7 sets * 5 pieces) so 124 legendarys(Syringer and drill included, Pipe revolver ignored(if I didn't make a mistake)).
---
From another post: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmv494/datamined_list_of_all_weapons_and_armor/
---
There are:
---
* 44 ranged
---
* 44 melee
---
* 100 armor pieces
---
188 different legendaries.
---
23% chance of a ranged weapon
---
23% chance of a melee weapon
---
53% chance of an armor piece
---
1% chance of a rounding error.
---
That's a good idea but not everyone has reddit. I tell players about this subreddit all the time you'd be suprised at how many players don't go on here.
---
I shovel well.  I shovel VERY well.
---
It counted because there is a glowing deathclaw AND a big fossil at the back of the cave, attached to the wall. Had to take picture of it separately.
---
Given the description that it doesn’t stack it’s likely that it’s 90% reduction ie. equal to GWS rank 3.
---
Same. We already have BoS combat armor, I want more faction skins for other sets!
---
I got the plans this week no problem
---
if they dont use reddit....they probably are noobs with trading
---
Noted. I'll let you know when it's up
---
Probably lag while the world fully loads in. They have most likely been looted in that world already.
---
Just a horrible idea all the way around
---
It just takes 2 weeks to reload.
---
That should be possible yes! I'll get that map done later and let you know
---
Yeah I AFK a lot I hang my ps4 controller off a wire behind the TV it works well.
---
The base budget is too small. I had to remodel recently to make room.
---
Hard to say. Sonys terrible with allowing cross play
---
Yep, that's the one.  Triggers at Dolly Sods.
---
Nuka perks plus nuka dark is +5 STR
---
full set of vanguard BOS COmbat armor and you damage/energy resistance is about 450
---
I think the vast majority of people playing fallout 76 are cross when they play already.
---
They are non living players
---
For some reason I’ve never sold a single item either.... so I really would love to sell something for $7k. :( But I cant even sell them for less. (Might be my camp placement)
---
If only you could force some glitchy textures or an upside down mob for the Beyond section!
---
What does this mean?
---
Yes. I noobed into this myself yesterday. Cost me a few caps of fast travel more than it should have.
---
I'd also like for them to expand on the Enclave scout armor, at its rather lacking compared to other sets even though it looks so damned cool.
---
No chat, no lots of things people wanted, reason why you were able to get the game so cheap so fast.
---
Everyone I play with cannot milk brahmin successfully either. I'm thinking a glitch
---
Just a play on the words ‘crossplay’
---
That's exactly my issue! Thanks!
---
I've had zero buyers that I'm thinking of just putting up shit to make it look like i got a lot.
---
from below the bridge. so dumb.
---
I strayed from the interactive maps because they were all slow, required hosting, and weren't mobile friendly. And unfortunately the raw data is 4GB of mostly unhelpful data
---
Love Mystery Men!
---
Usually you have to consider more than just the base weapon. For example, instigating is amazing for hard-hitting weapons (e.g. lever actions) if you're solo-XP/legendary farming, but terrible in a group, or if you're trying to fight a boss (e.g. SBQ, or even mirelurk queen).   
---
Another example of a situational affix is vampire. It's great if your goal is to tank damage, but it's not ideal for maximizing DPS. 
---
However, to get back to your question, I think there are a few clear cases. 
---
* Bloodied, swing speed, +str is almost always best-in-class for melee
---
* Furious is almost always top for miniguns due to their high rate of fire. 
---
* Quad is amazing for double-barreled shotguns and cryolators due to their otherwise crippling ammo capacities.
---
I don’t get it but ok
---
Dude give me one good reason why VATS is good, and not tell me the usual "fallout has always had VATS" be original, I can give you at least 5 reasons right now why it sucks. Prove me I'm wrong.  
---
BTW trying to make me less than you telling me that i suck etc etc its just the argument you use because you don't even have a good reason to argue and it is pathetic.
---
7-8k IMO
---
Location pictures do register, you just have to be in a very specific spot for it to work. The bridge one was most annoying until I figured out you have to take the photo from the ground, looking up.
---
Great :D thanks mate.
---
I wish. They showed off the backpacks like they were making dozens of different kinds but we only have 3 different ones.
---
What platform are you on? If your on PS4 i'll come take a look. Might have something i could use.
---
Talking about legendary effects, the Instigating one works well for ranged stealth in PVE, Lever action or the recently buffed hunting rifle with .50 receiver.
---
Bloodied effects works well too (is the one im using at moment, BE Lever do 500 per shot x2.5 dmg from stealth)
---
I’ve had an issue where it will say one minute left on my disease but that actually means 10 more mins
---
I am trying for that too. Basic early plans I wish I had had and ammo for the guns they are picking up as well as healing Chems. Once I do another steel run I plan to add some low level but great condition weapons too. I moved from the Savage divide to near flatwoods to attract the younglings. I feel like after levelling over 100 it's kinda the least I can do.
---
[Just for you](https://i.imgur.com/Yh405pF.jpg)
---
I think you missed one of the most common reasons to not get on mic.  
---
Some people aren't gaming alone from their rooms. Some are in a room with other people.  
---
It can be annoying for the other player to constantly hear the background noise of a TV, or other people talking. People might engage in private conversation.  
---
Or on the other side, they don't want to bother the others in the same room with their talking to a screen, that they choose not to.  
---
At the end of a day, there are thousands of reasons to not talk into a microphone all the time.
---
They still have caps to purchase goods with noobs or not I'll take them.
---
Besides if you can cut out a step on 2 or 3 ☆ legendaries they're more likely to buy them. I know it'll be a pain but I'm gonna roll with the sign. If the upkeep cuts too much into my time I'll take it down.
---
Go to the robot quest giver.
---
Hmm it seems quite clearly orange on PC.
---
either that or lower the budget cost of foundations, roofs and turrets so they dont take such a massive toll on the whole budget
---
Yup, it was all just a dream.
---
Weight wise it would be great being able to sell complete PA's. For now you could at least split em all up in the machine and hope someone understand that it's a set lol.
---
This is a great gift for the community. I appreciate all your hard work and the work of the others that helped with the project.
---
this is why i put my shower by the stair into the 2nd floor of my camp, which leads to the little more exclusive area... if you wanna go, you better be clean AF :D 
---
but feel free to be filthy while you use the rest of my camp
---
I am. Psn overurhead360. Should be on tonight est time zone.   I also don’t have any plans for sale. So I’m thinking people see “0 plans” and they lose interest. I’ll have to change my selling points I guess.
---
Just curious about this as i have 4 lvl 2 mules full...is it feasable to use them to scrap instead of transfering to my main? I mean can those mules buy higher lvl items or will they be capped? I dont wanna lock scrip away if they have to be lvl50 to use the purveyor anyways..but was a thought..
---
So I have doorways but no doors on my camp and a decontamination shower right in front of the lower doorway and I have never had an enemy enter my house. I did have a wolf destroy my fusion generator but that was up on the cliff my C.A.M.P is a little south of Lake Eloise
---
Oh I hope so
---
The corn is a nice addition lol
---
[Yep](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asralt/post_patch_6_new_pa_skins_data_mined/)
---
I usually look for aid and weapons to see whether i want to head over. Sometimes junk.
---
I feel like I’m going to be rolling in 1 handed melee weapons. Does anyone even use those?
---
Incredible piece of work that you have created, I am in awe You have a real talent!
---
Haha really?
---
Thanks!!
---
4 GB can be compressed smaller and generally hosted for free especially if you only use 5 or 6 fields. I've got databases with 25+ fields that contain 220,000 individual records that compress into about 1GB. AGO allows a small bit of free hosting mainly to accommodate students. The AGO platform is also compatible with all smart phones and can be accessed via web as well. There's a whole field of people like me who take raw data and put it into web and mobile mapping applications. I'd be willing to help.
---
I haven't gotten stuck yet but I spawn in weird spots that I'm able to get out of.
---
I don't want to know who bought what.  In fact, it would be nice if the game didn't tell me in notifications.  Knowing what was sold is useful though.  Keep it anonymous.
---
Yeah most of my friends dropped off when the launch broke so hard. Do you have any specific ones in mind?  You can add me.  My PSN is my username here
---
&gt;I’m sure players would still visit a vendor that didn’t have a great rating.
---
I doubt it would you visit a store with bad online reviews?
---
yes.. ive done all the trouble shooting there is to do.. its borked...
---
Enjoy the downvotes...
---
I'm actually impressed that someone hasn't come along and grabbed all my freebies for resale! Kudos wastelanders!
---
I have a full set of modded leather armor that would be great for a new character....with absolutely no sales on it.
---
So, I'm going the classic retail model of seeing what does sell, and focus on those items. And I'll just take the rest to a vendor for a 5 cap sale!
---
A lot of people assume that when player vendors offer rare items at a ridiculously cheap price that they don't know the market value...but sometimes that's not the case. I had some rare BOS armor plans in my machine priced at 25 caps and actually received a message from someone who bought them saying he felt bad and offered to buy something for 1000 caps to make the deal fair.  I explained that I have plenty of caps and priced it so low because I thought it would make someone extremely happy to find such a good deal.
---
As soon as you start to spawn run like you hear banjos, I can't tell you the number of camps that would have spawned on top of me lol
---
Wait so, couldn't you have said it offers every legendary in the game? It looks like it has everything.
---
Cross = angry
---
Play = play
---
Playing angrily
---
im just  happy we can put them out again without fear of other players wrecking them
---
Haha!! This is so true. The best thing about FO76 is the community... The fans... The dedicated, creative, awesome people...
---
The worst thing about FO76 is... the griefers... The jerks... The lazy, boring, lame people... (although these are few and far between)
---
Oh... and when the server crashes after completing an hour's worth of quest progression...
---
&gt;So next thing will be north of second holotape.
---
There was that new vault in north side of map.
---
Best served cold. Good job!
---
For me, everything on the musician badge worked except for playing an instrument at the Nukashine. Also, didn't have to play anything unti well tuned. Half a second was enough. Though as I say the Nukashine instruments aren't registering.
---
top of the world,stones throw from lift.that leaves 4 to remember,and I didn't know about big bend.
---
very day is a school day.......oh oh oh......water treatment plant south of the burrows.
---
Ran it last night bud, 18 legendaries which ended with a 3 star bloodied Gatling gun on green at back of big houses..it certainly seems to be quieter but I've also noticed a reduction in 3 star legendaries dropping 1 star armour and weapons...
---
Thanks. I'll keep this in mind for the future.
---
Haven't seen a nuke zone there since latest patch, and I've been playing a lot. But on a wierd note, I killed a legendary sting wing there and got a great legendary fat man!!
---
You can't normally get stuff like Urban Scout Armor or Ultracite Gatling Lasers to be Legendary in the Base Game. If this list is accurate, the Purveyor can provide these.
---
Super Duper is great for crafting serums if I craft 10 I usually end up with 14-15 if you don't have this perk card get it.
---
What platform are you on?  I play on xbox and have been thinking about putting my Vampire's explosive shotgun in my machine.  I never use the thing because I'm a rifleman build so it's just taking up space in my stash.  If you're also on xbox, I can let you know when it's put up for sale.
---
As I continued to say, maybe the best route is to not have a bad rating at all. And only have good ones. No negatives if you don’t sell a lot, but the game encourages you to have fair prices because a higher score will result in more visitors.
---
I'm pretty sure you can still take photos for challenges even if the gallery is full. They just won't be saved
---
So it's still worth nuking then, sounds good, I'll do that tonight!
---
SQUEEEE!
---
Seriously though, many thanks if you can pull that off.  I attempted to dip my toe into the data mining pool (for an unrelated project, trying to get a list of all vendor items, and things beyond), but I'm not quite equipped to handle that on the casual level I was hoping for.  I'm a data analyst, but not a programmer, so my toolbox is rather limited.
---
And seriously, you should collab with the other guy who does the mapping - your data would seriously clog up the map the way they're doing it, so it may not be something you can combine, but if nothing else comparing notes might lead to something.
---
Oh man i loved back in the days when the strongest and most intense weapon i had was a black-powder rifle..Ah the memories of adrenaline
---
good tips.
---
you think the build will survive good enough without power armor? i don't have the greatest armor items, but i guess i'll get there.
---
You mention that, and I realize that Tuesday and yesterday I got 2 fat man's off of sting wings.......
---
If you made an option for the vendor to reimburse FT cost of thier own accord and out of thier own pocket in exchange for "X" amount of sales yeah that'd be cool and would drum up business. Especially if it's advertised when you view the camp.
---
great tip, thx
---
these are all great suggestions! 
---
 /u/Ladydevann 
---
/u/Valseek
---
looks like just PC and Xbox at the moment, once one spawns they tend to spread like wildfire as if you scrap you unlock ability to craft.
---
Always worth nuking WS, I still say it's one of the best areas when nuked for decent legendaries when running well
---
Willing to give it a whirl with ya
---
I just made you 1 and put in my vender thing for 200 caps i'm over by point pleasant PC
---
Imagine a quadruple dragon.
---
Yeah. It’s somewhere in the chem bench’s menu if I remember right. Look for insect repellent.
---
You can’t fill them up anymore according to the patch notes. I guess if it was already full it’ll stay that way until drunk dry
---
took some tips into consideration and this is my new build. also consider all the mutations. i will probably get grounded too as it has been fixed now (suposedly)

---
Nicest thoughts from the worst PSN....
---
I’m down for pretty much anything lol, I could never convince my friends it was a good game due to rough launch. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Most expensive thing I'm selling is the forest asylum uniform for a little over 7k, I believe, just because of how rare it is, and that's how much I paid for it. Everything else goes for cheap!
---
I just hope there's still a reliable source for scrip, my stock pile is likely going to run out before the vendor comes, but I have enough to hit the limit. Will just have to drop more nukes than I normally do.
---
i knew something was up....i hope its a mistake? Was it put our in patchnotes or anything?
---
Your gamer tag have a green face
---
That's the key element. Dropping nukes for sure...
---
Yes.
---
For the Ripper, it's the Gladiator perks.
---
No, a pic of power armor in the mire.
---
Possibly with a popup giving a few general areas of why such as 'Aesthetic/Style', 'Price', 'Too many of this item'
---
You found the dark Firelike Shrine.  Creepy.
---
Maybe, I think the longest streak ive done without getting one is 4. Also, you might have to be Possum rank to get Possum badges. I dont think I tried while I was still a tadpole.
---
It would be a great added option. Even if Crossplay was limited to just friends that you invite to your world. 
---
Some might not want to play with Keyboard &amp; Mouse users, but if other players from other platforms didn’t auto populate another platforms sever it might be a good time.
---
If Xbox/PS4 users could invite PC users to their games (and vice versa) think how many more Reddit meets ups or Buying/Selling/Trading meetups could happen across all the platforms.
---
You cant choose levels on the items from the purveyor, only type and quality. This indicates to me that they will be level locked to the character doing the rolling. So we cant use our mules to collect Scrip, or else all of the items they purchase will be of inferior level.
---
Out of interest, is your main house locked?
---
Just wondering if you have had any problems with players spawning in your house and having to be let out?
---
Im hoping my move around like yours will cure that issue so I can have a locked farm lol
---
Not my main. She is one finely coiffed cannibal.
---
ok ok im gonna have to start using the phrase "run like you hear banjos" in real life!!! made me smile, i needed that, thanks
---
Yeah interestingly my buddy pushed me towards pre order knowing I love fallout. I was trying to be the caution voice like "MMO launches usually go badly" then he quit and I'm doing fine
---
By gosh you're right!!!! and there's absolutely no way anyone would exploit this to give bad reviews even though they're not deserved
---
Yes, let's make Fallout Yelp maybe it won't be the shitstorm of fake reviews real Yelp gets
---
I can’t find you on xbox. Can you find me
---
That you get robot instead. I'll fix the scout armor
---
I’m assuming your gamertag is the same as your reddit handle?
---
I have a great mic and I love using it.  However, while I was playing last night my wife was watching Hulu very loudly, and when I tried to compliment a guy on his CAMP all he heard was a commercial about workout equipment.  Which was funny after I got her to mute the TV so I could talk to the guy, but that would have been easier for everyone involved with text.
---
Free Yao Guai for your syringer kill.  Ugh - not looking forward to that one.
---
Roger that
---
My other 4 cheaters are all above 50 i was experimenting with different builds and mule is almost 50 for weight reduction perks
---
Oh shit you're right. Oops.
---
Lol no it’s grizzlybear1210
---
I use marsupial and hop away before load-in.
---
The vault 51 overseer is going to be found close to where the second holotape is
---
Yes, this. I was wishing for this before i moved a couple of days ago. I'd been in the same spot for months, and didn't really want to change my camp, just move it. Anyway, i just gritted my teeth, blueprinted, and as expected, had to start from scratch because my camp couldn't be placed anywhere.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯   
---
Hopefully my new design is more portable, but chances are i'll just stay where i'm at forever because of this PITA system.
---
I've been inspired to do it too, although once I had to use a bubblegum bear to wipe as I had no toilet paper.
---
If you're on Xbox and want to volunteer your camp I'm logging on now. :D
---
Typo from meeee
---
My only companion was the daylight, marking the passage of time. Praise the Sun!
---
Holy shit. My mistake for coming here and trying to discuss potential QOL mechanics. 
---
I am talking about an automated scoring system.
---
No actually player input, no written reviews.
---
An automated score system that gives you a point when you sell something.
---
Sure, you could cheat the system by buying a lot of stuff from someone, but isn’t that what vendors are for?
---
Other players could see what vendors are selling a lot and what ones aren’t. That’s it. 
---
But I can see people just want to downvote and be sarcastic.
---
You are a saint and a scholar. Thank you.
---
I just want to bring my PC character a camp to ps4. I don't even need linked progression. I just want to transfer.
---
Which bucket of bolts is he talking about? Modus?
---
yes so many reasons to be unable to list all of them here, thank you for including these!
---
Interested in this info
---
came up recently , so I gave it some thought,
---
is there ANY DIFFERENCE in the map, between platforms ?
---
If not, then one would assume, yes it should be perfectly achievable.
---
servers shouln't be send/recieving machine code, only variables.
---
I could easly be flat wrong tho
---
Forget it. Fopund one at the bathrooms next to it
---
Thanks for that, and for beating me to the cross-link.  I knew my extensive data mining couldn't be that far off (I copy/pasted from the wiki into excel to count them :P )
---
Also, more fuel for me to learn how to do the data-mining work myself, which I've been meaning to get into.
---
Agreed! I'm going to be so pissed if I get a 1 star wood armor from my 3 star roll
---
Sent you an invite
---
Its fo4 with players. If your not a fan of multiplayer i feel ya. But after that shit show of fo4.. I welcome reading quests again. And friends to help or just fuck around.
---
Joining now
---
They probably got hungry so had a healthy snack
---
That is genuinely frightening.   I haven't seen that yet, but I'm getting tired of having to kill ghouls lying down on the ground.  It's almost like they are too lazy to bother getting up anymore.
---
Stuff like this is why I connected my decon shower to an easily accessed powered switch.
---
Lol no problem!
---
*just* 3
---
At level 196, I only found two explosives. Level 35 TSE dragon, and level 50 nocturnal explosive gatling plasma. At least I was lucky enough to get good drops the two times I got it
---
So does my dancing
---
If it helps the new campfire event involves a LOT of bugs. You can get everything you need for the repeatable doing it (though bloatflies show up less commonly).
---
My guess is based upon the buyers level
---
You can already do this lol
---
You can go to you're inventory and hit inspect and then you can rename
---
You can still photograph the corpse, that counts.
---
Mute is also a thing.
---
Regarding the Power Armor Frame’s 60 dmg/60energy/60rad bonus they have said nothing that I have seen. It’s neither confirmed to be a bug or to be an intentional fix by Bethesda. 
---
I get the reasoning behind “Nerfing” Over-Repair. I don’t get why Power Armor Frames no longer add to ones Power Armor defense stats. The literal “Core” or Frame of the Power Armor would add to its overall defense statistics. Seems illogical.
---
If there was some transparency on Bethesda’s part we wouldn’t have to guess.
---
Yeah that's been a thing from a few big patches back.
---
Dayman!
---
Fighter of the Nightman!
---
Champion of the sun!
---
since beta...
---
Not at white springs,  but I killed a 3* legendary last night at watoga high and he didnt drop a legendary item at all.
---
Spawn on the border... It will be 50ft from cliff edge mid air, better wear pa for falling 😅
---
Ummmm... Yeah, that's been live for a while now.
---
This person a god damn genius people
---
My brain died writing this list which is why I put urban twice!
---
Those things already existed in the game though.
---
There's like a half dozen name variants for "Framed Lighthouse" pictures.
---
I would actually like to discuss rather that get sarcastic comments and downvotes.
---
Why is some sort of automated scoring system that would show players what vendors are fair and what ones are not such a crazy idea? 
---
It shows us what items are there, Why not also try to show players the kinds of prices that are available too? 
---
I am not talking about Yelp where players get to exploit and write written reviews. I am talking about an automated scoring system. 
---
Yes, I initially was talking about “bad” scores, but if you actually read, you can see that I agree that is a bad idea.
---
So anyone who sells consumables sky rockets in the rating system. If you're off the beaten path and don't get much traffic or you sell high tier legendaries which command a higher price you get screwed. Yep!! no flaws in your amazing idea it's bullet proof!!! 
---
&gt;Sure, you could cheat the system by buying a lot of stuff from someone
---
Thanks for admitting it's not a good idea
---
That’s a good idea
---
Coming to you now
---
I have mine right inside my front door, but the switch to turn it on/off is outside the door (just in case someone leaves it on).  But my vending machines are on my porch, so you don’t have to pass through it to get to them.
---
Nope! The only things with legendary power armor are a few cut effects and that one file for scripping them.
---
Ok. I’ll go for the high capacity one then. Do you know if the mods change the appearance of the packs?
---
Forgive me if I'm mistaken about this, but wouldn't you need to reload that 4 times to get it full?
---
I'd hate to waste a whole play session just for that :P
---
What they said. Inspect the PA and select the option to rename it
---
#URBAN SCOUT ARMOR
---
#FOREST SCOUT ARMOR
---
#ULTRACITE GATLING LASER
---
#BONE HAMMER
---
you can , along with your weapons. get pip boy out and inspect your stuff. there is a rename option.
---
I had one and received multiple 10k+ offers and I ended up trading it for a 3* BE 10mm smg.
---
It’s worth a lot for the right person.
---
World subheading of the Challenges menu. 
---
There will be a list of Challenges starting with Tadpole: Athletics. That’s how you earn the merit badges little Tadpole! Have fun!
---
“Kill well... and often”
---
Temporary work around: spawn at the nearest map point and run over.
---
are you referring to the Nuka Plant pic or the AVS Med Center pic? if you are, those have to be taken the old way via the map photomode.
---
Maybe add a heavier variant of it called like Urban/Forest Assault Armor? Kinda makes sense that ‘scout’ armor isn’t the most defensive set in the game, so one geared towards soldiers rather than recon could fill that role pretty well.
---
Ha ha ha
---
I've had to move one of mine as the increase in visitors represents an increase in spawns as well.
---
So the solution is kill the customers.  Wait if i kill the customers there is no reason for the vending machines. This is making my head hurt.
---
Definitely trying this tonight!!
---
Wow in my opinion thoes are bad legendary i wouldn't ever use them 
---
Thats just not the type of stuff i would roll with
---
Let’s create some lore for this dark timeline then. 
---
In this timeline a free states member, too poor to afford his own bunker, signed up for vault 76 with the intention of stopping whatever experiment was inside, however with no experiment he was simply the kept challenging the overseers authority. One day, in a drunken fit of rage over believing he and the free states were wrong about the vaults, he wandered the vault tearing panels from the wall, computers from the desk, anything to find out what vault tec was doing to him, he was driven mad thinking that the experiment was right in front of him and he just couldn’t see it, so he came to the conclusion that everyone must be in on it, they all must be running excitements on him, that’s why James down the hall kept coming over asking if he wanted to be in a band, he was checking the results of some white noise test only he could hear. With reclamation day just around the corner he came up with a plan, when the vault opened and the government came to see the results, he would send a message. When the day finally came he sat in his seat, waiting, until finally he stood, raised his cup of punch, and gave a toast to the overseer, and everyone drank except him, moments later they all fell to the floor. The automated protocols still happened though, even with one resident left that was enough for reclamation day. And he stepped outside expecting an armed guard or some pencil pusher from Washington. But instead he found the outside just as dead as the inside. As he wandered he realized, he was alone. It seemed that something known as the “scorched” killed or converted everyone, but someone from the responders created a virus that targeted scorch, and killed them. Giant bats litter the streets and trees, red corpses with green poking out lay with eyes and mouths still open, starring at him. It was when he reached whitesprings that he decided to end it. He had always theorized that the government would hide under whitesprings, but all he found there were destroyed robots and dead raiders. Everything he believed was a lie, the government didn’t hide in whitesprings, the vaults didn’t hide experiments, and he killed this worlds best chance at seeing civilization again, so, with a gun he found in one of the whitesprings shops, he sat in the comfy couch, downed a bottle of scotch, and put the gun to his head
---
I can not upvote this suggestion enough!  I'm always in the same boat looking for stations to scrap junk.
---
🤣
---
Lose the tighty-whiteys and we're talking.
---
I like to get down in my undies beer helemt and sit on my couch while people shop. Cant tell you how many people strip down, throw their beer helmet on a pop a squat next to me. I have quite a few hilarious pictures. Its almost like this should be a faction. Lol
---
Yeah that'd actually make a lot of sense considering you can get heavy and light combat armor/ heavy and sturdy leather armor.
---
OMG i have been chasing those things for days and never thought of this! internet high-five
---
Well the effects not the weapons
---
Same here  PSN: DecimatedDreams
---
I have mine behind a powered door so when the machine is on the door is open and when it’s off it’s closed.
---
And everybody else who only wants a god roll shovel to fuck around with will be annoyed when they get a quad explosive combat shotgun, so you can just buy it off them
---
Did you get someone? I'll help you, if you help with my daily challenges.
---
I couldn't even tell where the shooting range was until I finally had to look for it.  And for that matter, I couldn't figure out how to craft a Crossbow either.  I ended up buying the Crossbow plan at Whitesprings, only to find that I apparently already knew it (and, equally apparently, am blind at seeing (KNOWN)).
---
At least the experience didn't cost you 500 caps. 😉
---
I never said this was a bullet proof idea. I just wanted to have a discussion. Sarcastic cunt.
---
This is fantastic!  Thank you so much for this.
---
For the Cargobot one, a very easy method. I used a Supply Requisition holotape to call in an aid drop, fast traveled to the drop area and snapped a pic when it was just about to drop it off.
---
Showers are SO 2075
---
Someone helped me, thank you
---
Bugged since forever, sorry about it
---
Once is stuck, just move on
---
Buy cheap 3 stars...esp armour..they are out there, if you are PS4 then you should defo swing by my camp, I've a good deal for all
---
Yes, it is.
---
Can't have *for now**. The patch notes very clearly said it's being temporarily removed until they adjust it
---
I noticed this too.  There are a number of times when I'll be wandering the world and wonder if something had always been that way, or it if got touched-up in the patch.

The deathclaw can be in the picture too, but you need to have the fossil be listed as a subject by the camera. Taking a picture of anything won't count unless the camera displays its name before the picture it taken.
---
This will be good info for those that haven't done it yet. Thank you
---
~~Rating System is needed for Player Vendors~~
---
When players don't sell anything they'll know thier prices are to high and lower them or offer better items.
---
Your title needed help FTFY
---
I wonder if when you buy from her, your scrip amount goes up (even partially) like at a vendor.
---
Relog (assuming you're not hopping servers anyway).  I completed that portion I think 2 days ago, and the rest of them yesterday.  None of them gave me any problems.
---
There are a few spots that have ~100% guaranteed wolf spawns (and I'm not sure if prefixes affect the challenge -I.E. if a glowing wolf doesn't count, but diseased does, or something like that).
---
Just SE of Huntersville, at the small BoS graveyard just east of the road is what I believe to be a guaranteed wolf pack.  My camp used to be near there and it always had wolves for me.  I'd check that place out, and hop servers once or twice if it doesn't want to work.
---
Also, corpses seem to count for the photo, so try that as well.
---
Wow, that sucks... didn’t realise you needed the radiated ones...
---
Thank Europe. Then passed a law stating that if a game has text then text-to-speech has to bee added as well. That's a lot of work and money, so the game doesn't have it.
---
Sometimes I don’t even get the notification of what was bought. Just the amount in caps shows up and I have to guess what it was.
---
I'm on Xb1, but iv been nabbing bs pieces up from vendor camps, I bought a handful of 3* pieces from 1 camp for around 30-50 caps each the other night.
---
Anyone verify / test this? I had 5k in 5.56 for a cap each and my caps stayed the same but all the ammo was bought.
---
I love this idea.  They could literally create dozens of quests for each faction. I think with the new Wastelanders DLC Bethesda should bring back human NPC's that give quests and roam around the map.  The machines that give you faction specific stuff would be amazing!!!! You could have all kinds of cool decorations and skins.  Heck even throw in some legendary faction specific weapons and armor like they do in survival. 
---
**My biggest request is that I really feel like you should only be able to join 1 faction.**  I hated the idea that you could join all the factions in Skyrim. It made no sense as many of the groups had completely different goals. There needs to be a way the game can track this. I feel like once you join a new faction your other stuff is should be gone.  In New Vegas the other factions would attack you if you were disliked by them.  Some factions should have loose alliances and others should be outright enemies. Imagine all the cool events you could have with this. Faction battles over workshops and supply drops.  Would be awesome!
---
Have an upvote!
---
Not in someone else’s camp
---
Totally agree. And i wouldn't even be mad if this was disclosed as a rebalance,  but the fact no mentions of it anyway,  is a bit annoying.
---
Caps is more valuable now because people are spending it a lot with the new player vendor machine.   
---
I noted an increased demand for it in the "black market", People are paying real money for caps so is more profitable to sell the items for caps and sell the caps for real money.
---
I think you are mostly correct. Bethesda did say they were working on it at some point and that they put it on the back burner to focus on the game launch. Here’s hoping.
---
Radiation adds flavor!
---
I had something happen like this to me in GTA4.  My character was running, literally tripped over a sidewalk, flew forward a bit, got damage from falling, then rolled into an on coming car.  I had my buddy there when this happened, and we both looked at each other like "what the fuck, did I just trip, fall, and get run over?"
---
That's great! Now, can you do one for the critters (chicken, foxes, cats, squirrels, etc.)?
---
Welp shit xd
---
You want to buy my superior over-priced, mass produced products from me, you meet my terms and conditions.
---
If that means a rad shower and then crawling through a pit full of scorpions before I allow you to queue for two days before I open the doors, then those are the terms.
---
This is America, damn it. *shoots gun in air*

+30 weight and foods have a longer durability. Does not stack with the salty skill
---
Insulated adds 90 to Energy Resistance
---
👀
---
well...that doesnt really make it better xD
---
i mean...it cant be that hard to fix that stupid value. it was reported several times too.
---
so why does it take half a year to fix one of these issues, but not fix the other?
---
every few months or so i log in to try the new changes. by now its more like a joke to see what they messed up this time.
---
It does what a refrigerator does it makes food last longer.
---
Had this this morning on XBONE when visiting the creamery.
---
Great backstory for a horrifying experience! 
---
10/10
---
You already made up you're mind. I'm not trying to change it. You're just crying bc you scrubbed out of PvP.
---
Btw, you can buy BOS plans for fairly cheap in Grafton now, or I guess like you used to be able to.
---
You may have seen this but the scout armor will be available from the legendary vendor!  I wonder if it will drop as loot from legendary enemies as well?
---
You have to complete 3 tadpole challenges
---
I went to Flotwoods and server hopped about 10 times to get that done.  There are 3 (at least) spawn points for brahman groups there, you can run a small circle from the starting point and get about 6-7 total before re-logging.
---
Sometimes I'd get ~1 per hop, sometimes 2-3, but no more.  It's not a guarantee any more.
---
Sorry I have only one upvote to give you...
---
It's the same with sweet rolls too
---
Come join the Pioneer Scouts! We have backpacks with 30 and 60 extra carry weight for Opossum Scouts.
---
hop all the spawns on 1 server
---
💖 good luck!
---
I did read your note on colorblind but I always feel like I have to tell anyone this to get the thought process of this going.
---
Implementing support for colorblind people doesn't have to be hard. There is many ways to do this.
---
1. Would be to use gray scale instead of colors.
---
2. You can use different shapes for the different items. Nuka cola could be a circle. Stimpack triangle. Corn could be a hexagon.
---
I feel as though it's always important to allow accessibility to everyone. 1/3 of the population is colorblind. It's always something to keep in the back of your head.
---
I can also note that there are other visual problems people have like poor visual site. You might start to see games adding the ability to change the text size. I'm not saying you need to change the text size but it's something to thing about
---
You might have run out of dry kindling - during the last phase you can go back to the trees to pick up more kindling once it no longer gives you the option to add kindling.
---
It got so many upvotes, because people didn't know you need to power it to show on the map, but didn't know that it DOESN'T need to be powered to work at all.
---
LMAO The salt is strong with this one I didn't mean to hurt your feelz maybe you ought to switch to a Magical Princess Castles game it's a much safer space than the Appalachian Wasteland
---
Thx
---
These are amazing!! Thank you for all your hard work :)
---
Could you do animals at all?? Even it if was just a general area where you could typically find them. Walking around looking for chickens and rabbits to photograph for the new Scout badges is taking a while!
---
Does this suggest still no legendary enclave plasma, or did my tired eyes glance over it?
---
Might start collecting the communist propaganda flyers to drop
---
What Power Armor Paintjobs have bugged damage resist values?
---
Could you imagine them accidentally basing one of the skins off the Winterized Paintjob? That would give said skin extra Energy resistance would it not?
---
Oh? I hadn't seen that yet....now I'm excited! May 16th could not come fast enough. 
---
It would be nice if it does get added to loot tables from then on.
---
You can still make yourself relive those moments. Remove your OP perk cards, try a low level legendary/just craft a lower level weapon, make yourself some lower level armor. Maybe play legendary roulette - only use the latest legendary you found for each slot
---
Can confirm this too: after an unsuccessful twenty minutes drowning each other or dying to radiation in the lake below the Scout camp, my fellow Tadpole and I just dropped plasma grenades on ourselves in the tiny stream near Morgantown!
---
I'm almost always at Camp, obsessing over millimeter perfect placement of a chair or something moronic but **bravozuluzero** on PSN if you feel you need a hand with other challenges. Good luck!

I think it depends on the level of the creature that gave you the disease.  I'm not certain though.  I've had 4-hour diseases in the past (Blight, from the SBQ) and 15-minute diseases from rando molerats.
---
Upper floors attached to metal stairs cost hand over fist less than foundations. My gf and I will build a solid foundation, build up or down, then come back to the original floor with another set of stairs and replace all but 1 foundation with an upper floor piece. 
---
Food costs a lot of space as well. 
---
Turrets eat it up too.
---
If you're on ps4 I would love to tour your home and find the last missing piece to your this puzzle. I would also love to pass on some techniques and secrets in person :p
---
Ok, but we aren’t int Appalachia, we are on Reddit.
---
People come here to discuss topics.
---
Or not all people do, I guess.

It reduces bacis bag carry weight by half. No add another 30.

I've found 2 level 21 deathclaws and 1 diseased 21 deathclaw today. I have a base charisma of 4 and using wasteland whisperer 3 I am also level 150. I only have the option to pacify. Playing on a PC.
---
I like CAMPS by mountains
---
You on PC? I've got a fair number of three star trapper armor I'd be willing to trade in exchange for marine armor. Don't have the exact details with me at the moment but if I recall correctly several pieces are sentinel/cavalier gear.
---
We should add a way to sell items to other players too. Maybe even at our camp......👀
---
Ah shit, thats a shame. Thanks for the info.
---
just looked at another unrelated post there. pc has differing options for keyboard............................ didn't say it would be easy.
---
Its an area wide thing. You gotta run around the mire area collecting insect parts. Should be a trackable quest. But ultimately if you wanna buy the bug parts or if you already have them this counts towards competion as well
---
I was cycling a few but then I ran out of caps. :/
---
I don't use it i rather have 30 carry weight more than tones of nonspoiled foood :D
---
Funny thing that inspect sometimes work and sometimes not... No idea what's the reason.
---
Yeah, it says control the pests at Dolly's but it's actually more of a scavenger quest, the yaoguis outside or whatever spawns for you don't have anything to do with it
---
“You are what you eat”
---
Good to know!  I haven't been to the Grafton vendor in ages.  Might have to head there this evening to see what other wares are being offered now
---
The fast travel option is probably its best use honestly.
---
I had some quality drops there yesterday.  In fact the server I was on was throwing out 3\* legendaries all over the place.  I snagged a sentinel robot leg yesterday off a 3\* when I fast traveled to someones shop. Also snagged an AA/SS/Red Weight Revolutionary sword.
---
The only time I didn't get  3\* items was from the SBQ yesterday......I can honestly say in the dozens of times I've fought her I have never got anything good.
---
This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
---
Actually, I don’t think Legendary Hunting Rifles were really a thing until after a lot of duping was nixed.
---
When I logged off this morning I weighed over 700 pounds can I sew a bunch of backpacks together? But I am banking scrip once I slowly walk to the train station.
---
At least you can still fast travel
---
I've been using player vending to get rid of all my crap. But people are buying out my plans too quickly, I already don't have enough to fill up all 120 slots anymore. Gonna have to start making mutation serums or something
---
I'm pretty sure I haven't made that many caps yet haha. Just when I make a few, I end up needing them for fast travel or something. I gotta work on that lol.
---
He must be talking about modus right?
---
Are you calling me dumb, or.....?
---
And if you pop some rad-x do you still die in nuke zone?
---
upvote because this sounds like a Community reference
---
That's a solid maybe. The source data I have is only world items. Getting mob spawn data would be a very big addition unfortunately.
---
I had to run it twice yesterday to get it completed.  My rad roach meat spoiled. lol
---
your pictures (i'm fairly sure ) are local to 'your' system. they may still be there.
---
Why?
---
no, it’s dumb that the pic is taken from below the bridge. like... only 10% of the bridge makes it into the frame, where other locations you need nearly the entire thing in the frame.
---
People have been providing plenty of reasons why this is a bad idea. You ignore their ideas whine aboit downvotes and continue to say it's not a discussion just because no one agrees with you doesn't mean it's not a discussion.
---
Listen Snowflake not everyone will agree with you get over it. My mistake forgot it was reddit this will help  r/disneyprincess

That's what I figured it was only 30 lbs

You can come to my CAMP tonight I’ll pay good amount of caps
---
Well, found it!
---
I didn’t take the pictures through the system. I took them with photo mode. Which doesn’t save it locally.
---
Yes if someone can do same for me! GT AmandaJ79
---
I don't see the problem. You can now sell almost anything. There's players of all levels so pretty much anything you could pick up someone could actually need. So when I'm out I grab shit I'd never before. Like grenades I'll never use them but other people do and literally every dead raider has one haha.
---
With the weight glitch of updates past, I'd pick up everything for no reason and it was a waste of space and server stress. I mean I'm still picking up everything but it's to sell.
---
I gotta liquidate these magazines. I have what feels like all of them.
---
If you're having trouble getting people to shop stock your shop with lots of everything it'll intice people to stop by. Hell you could sell 30 pipe guns to get people to buy your chems or whatever.
---
Because it’s fucking dumb how’s that for discussion
---
I finished anthem and played for awhile trying to level.  Anthem is nothing compared to FO76. So much more content and story over here in Appalachia.  I wish I could get a refund on Anthem.
---

---
From what I've been seeing on here It's tied to the player if they're in camp you can inspect the item. Hopefully this gets corrected soon.
---
Yep, this is correct.
---
That isn't to say that they *couldn't* figure out a way to do it, but I can't imagine that it would have been built into the game to start with (especially since it's built on a single player game base).  It would take quite a decent little change to the way the game works for it to find you a server, read into your data for the camp location, load up the world data to see if your spot was available (since it also has to load up everyone else's data on that world, as well as anyone in the queue before you), and THEN let you know if you're good to go.  The time it would take to do all that would be a hefty percentage of the time to just load things up in the first place.
---
It could be streamlined of course, by rewriting the whole login and world loading process.  That *might* be quite a chore (though that's just speculation, it might not be terribly hard).
---
It is customized. You get to choose what kind of item (armor, melee, ranged) and what quality (1 star, 2 star, 3 star). Seems right over the target for what was discussed.
---
Interesting. I knew that turrets were expensive items; they would be the first to go from my camp moving forwards. I had no idea that basic floor space was budgeted differently when placed on a foundation. I am on PS4, PSN Kerensky111r. Would be glad for any additional advice.
---
120 at max.
---
It's the cheap garbage 3 star legendary items that get me I can never find a 3 star walking cane it's always a fat man or harpoon gun.
---
I noticed this too. Either that a really strange but useful bug.
---
I haven’t found a legendary level action on my own yet, yesterday I found someone selling a 1 star two shot lever action and decided to give it a shot! I actually really enjoy this gun, packs a decent punch and with the speed demon mutation the reload is pretty awesome, if it’s a decent price I’d say go for it!!
---
all photo mode pics are on your system. I can delete mine without logging in.
---
I found one in a shed at the Solomons pond. I stashed that bad boy!
---
No clue.. I don’t have the lead lines mod yet
---
Games don't have text chat for a reason they want you to work through that together now just fill the lobby up with bullshit about IRL or calling people over to an area to help you kill something.
---
For me the let down has been the inspection issue as well as no fast travel mats. 
---
I've been looking for some specific 3 started items hut until I can see all the rolls I won't spend the cash.
---
Also, I'm going to break my button for all the sprinting I need to do not to get trapped in a foundation. 
---
I'd like to see a perk card for vendor travelling. Would work like the other perk card but it would be 10% cheaper and only work to a vending machine to offset the tax everyone is bitching about.
---
On xb1 it does save them on the HD not the server I don't know about other systems though
---
Yeah was just about to add that- so you need 6 boxes in total. So far I’ve found 2. 
---
I can never find things I’m actively looking for.. unlike say for the Collector badge where I’ve picked up about 80% of the teddies, when I’ve been randomly picking them up for scrapping to cloth. Argh.
---
Yeah! Like, why else have one?!
---
Lucky. Mine are all actual mules as I assume is the case for most others.
---
If last phase is bugs. Run around those 3trees, collect dry wood and keep fire lit. Kill mobs only when you meet any, fire is main focus.
---
You have to remove your power armor and gently approach from the side. Gently coo’ing as you sneak up. Check to make sure you are going to milk the correct sex Brahmin (they seem to change). And with a reassuring voice let the Brahmin know what you are doing and ask permission. Then you should be good to go.
---
If you are on xbox visit my shop later!  I have an assasins explosive lever on sale!  GT:shadyrebob
---
But they'd still have to make sure that the programming logic of the swap doesn't register it being unequipped at any point.
---
I appreciate this but surely Bethesda have a certain amount of self interest in maintaining the game. 
---
1. They need people to keep playing to keep people buying from the Atom Shop. 
---
2. It was PR and commercial failure. They have a big new IP (Star field) and Rage 2 coming out. The loyal players and new player who purchased Fallout 76 are part of their target market and they need to try and get some goodwill so that they purchase those new games. 
---
3. Bethesda aren’t EA and can’t simply say Fallout 76 was bad but Fallout 77 is coming next year and will be fantastic and Fallout 88 in two years will be even better. 
---
I know Bethesda have worked hard to introduce new stuff to the game and it has brought me back but it’s not a selfless gesture purely for the fans.
---
Yao Ming Guai is one of the toughest critters in the entire game.  Can you tame them?  They are fierce mofos.
---
you can get the bug parts anywhere.. you dont have to go to the circled areas to complete the quest...
---
Heck ya. It's not very good for vats but it is a very good gun.  What price is it listed at?
---
Thanks. That's helpful to try. Do you know if there's an inventory meter for the kindling?
---
That sir, may be the most genius of McGenius things I have McGeniuses seen is a genius while.

After my main hit lvl 200 i was looking for something new to do and started making different builds as respec is slow and i didn't want to get rid of my main build i just wanted to try something else

---
Nice, guess I'll have to server hop and check the drop quality before I launch. The best things I get from the queen are plans, but now that most of them are available those have been rendered useless
---
I am like you, I want X-01 Jetpack but actualy i use T-60 Jetpac on my X-01 armor ! ;)
---
I found one in the Mire yesterday when I was doing the bug quest.  I can remember exactly where it was but there is a really good map that shows the locations of everything.  Just google it up!
---
He does mention reclamation tho - so i think it will be somewhere between vault 76 and current location... Didn't find a thing tho.
---
How are people finding good weapons on vendors? On PC it only shows the first effect and you can not inspect the items.
---
Where would I go to view them on Xbox?
---
After the initial pay day, it was always going to become just "another thing" you can do.
---
I think that's something players aren't understanding with things like the Legendary Vendor either.  This stuff isn't meant to dramatically redefine and change the way you play the game.  It's meant to flesh things out and, over time, create a fuller product.
---
Thank you all for filling in the small gap Bethesda left
---
Thanks for the info. I made a video to spread it to the YouTube community.
---
Nice work
---
At what price?  It is a very good gun still.
---
Added you. I’ll be on this weekend. Need someone to do new backpack quest with
---
Close to West Tek
---
Managed those ones but I can’t find a coal deposit that works for the Miner badge, the coal veins in Gauley mine and the Burning mine don’t register and I haven’t yet found a deposit in the ground
---
No idea. I'd like to know too, if there are any other plans you can get from the Operation Tidy quest.
---
Nah it gives everything I pick up the potential to earn me money. Instead of crafting shit just or scrounging for myself I can keep a steady stream of profit while I'm out looking for new stuff with the added bonus of having enough money to buy anything I want.
---
Plus I like having people stop by my camp. I've found the prices fantastic compared to the in game prices and I'm not gonna troll Reddit looking for deals when I can do it with others in game.
---
I'm not a huge crafter so it helps having access to stuff I wouldn't bother crafting. If someone make a hundred nuka shines or whatever and wants to sell em for only a buck I'm down for that.
---
If the player is in their camp you can inspect the item but if they arent it doesnt allow you to.
---
I don't have much time right now but I can definitely show you some things if you accept the request.
---
I believe only a paint exists. You can get a plan for that from the tidy up daily in the toxic valley
---
Use the sharefactory app on ps4 it lets you slow and speed up time.
---
I think they just random loot now, I got one off a feral ghoul last night, and out of a desk, and I think a bug dropped another. Kinda weird when you cant even sell or trade them
---
I saw a in ground coal deposit. Due east from the church location in the mire. Like the other guy said on the way to the zone to find radroaches.
---
This is a loaded question that would depend on your building etc. 
---
I will say that my Two-Shot Explosive Lever Action breaks extremely quickly. I even run rank 5 Gunsmith which reduces weapon wear by 50%. It’s awful as a primary weapon if you need it for more than one fight in its TSE form. 
---
Personally I would go for an Instigating or Anti-Armor Lever Action Rifle. Those are the Legendary effects best suited to that gun.
---
Then just sleeping in my camp will be easier then writing on the wall 😅
---
Will do, that’s fantastic, I never knew there were ones in the ground 👍
---
I don't think teachers ever really have an off time.

anyway, how it worked for me: traveled to the East side of the bridge, got all the way down underneath it and took a picture almost completely straight up from underneath. trees in the way of the view and everything.
---
My bad. I’m sleepy from grinding lol
---
Neato burrito, see ya then.
---
Lol time to put a bed on the roof. I do AFK but if you want to actually play that wouldn't work to well.
---
Wow, so much stuff going on in Pleasant Valley cabins. There's a dots there on most of the maps.
---
Ok thank you!
---
I'm curious, is this something that will always happen? Free updates with new things or will it eventually be paid expansion??
---
It's in it's infancy. There are some issues for now that hopefully they iron out to make it more appealing.
---
If you want one, then of course it is
---
**No Mutants Allowed.**
---
I really wish Bethesda would give me a sign for that.
---
I made a level 15 one and shot about 40 arrows and the durability never went down. Maybe it’s a bug but I’ll try again today. Thanks for the help though!
---
It is absolutely amazing on all the cool items for sale from player vending machines
---
i get so confused at this community! usually they are all very nice to each other, but the people in the thread are very jealous of OP having CAPs and they are overly hostile to him
---
the most caps ive ever had at one time was 7000 and i felt rich, but that doent mean people have to be so rude to Op just because he has caps and they dont
---
plus, he can sell his stuff for whatever prices HE wants, its HIS vending
---
I am indeed on Xbox 😎 look out for sidthesloth814 later. Got some good stuff at my camp as welll 👍🏼👍🏼
---
I have a mic but I hate being forced to use it.  I am a woman and it invites all kinds of bullshit for me to use it at least half the time.  I would much prefer to just use a text chat.

It's important to note that you need a *Deluxe* Broken Prosnap Camera.

I definitely found another one at some point - pretty sure it was a random drop from a Ghoul.
---
If I remember correctly, they said everything that comes after you buy the game (expansions and updates) will be free of extra charge
---
Did you redact those words or were they like that in the code?
---
Taking a break from all the shooting, it sure would help alot...
---
I have found some really good deals and some really poor ones. Snagged a couple explosive weapons cheap that I re-priced and put in my machine.  Lots of good deals on junk too!
---
I think part of the problem is players mistakenly pricing their stuff wrong. I think they are trying to sell stack of things instead of individually pricing items. For example, I saw a guy selling a stack of 50 aluminum for 100 caps. That's actually a good deal but when I went to buy it multiplied everything.  Most of the shitty prices  on stacked items are errors imo.  As far as the other stuff goes I think people just don't understand what things are worth.
---
After vending runs for a few weeks I think people will find what sells and what doesn't and adjust prices accordingly.

I’m still really liking it. It makes the world feel more interesting, creates variety and helps me avoid some grind. For example, last night I was out of disease cures, I can never seem to keep many of them. I ran into someone’s CAMP and they had 20 of them for sale. Problem solved. 
---
Having multiple CAMPs around the map to visit and use stashes/workbenches is helpful too. 
---
I also really like that the CAMP icons show like other locations when walking around. It makes it all feel really natural.
---
Of course they can. They just haven’t taken the time to do it. At the very, very least we shouldn’t be dumped back in the same server we left when we select the option to change servers after the game tells us our camp spot is taken. That happens almost every time.
---
I guess you could build multiple vendor stations and just place a complete set of power armor and nothing else in one?
---
Gave my buddy an explosive furious pipe revolver. Still kicking myself for not just using it myself. Looks great, and is hilarious to play with.
---
Mmmm bobbleheads, nice. I may have to try to figure out a bobblehead farm route. Wish I could get only heavy weapons ones.
---
Ahh how the times have change! No more lucky finds for easy returns 😂
---
Altho now the map full of similar “like” stations 😂
---
Can confirm, I'm an idiot and needed ELI5, so that YaBoi poster helped.
---
Just get naked and crouch at Vault 76 or the Whitespring, someone usually comes along pretty quickly.
---
It's not a great system, takes some getting used to. I recommend trying with a simple shack blueprint first. Then try one with furniture, etc.
---
Any idea if food for sale is preserved? I've got to assume. Maybe keep it for sale for 25k and it'll stay fresh? Idk
---
yup found it.

If the next ones are at a river and a fork then who has any idea where that means
---
If you have bulk screws I will definetly visit. If you are interested in the lever let me know and I will pull it out of the machine.
---
What plan has those huge letters?
---
hey we all are a little dumb sometimes😂
---
I do believe you can see it in your inventory but I'm not sure which section because I haven't taken the time to look but my friend did look to check if you could keep dry kindling for the next event but apparently it disappears.
---
I’m setting up my shop as close to Vault 76 as I can get it so people can all fast travel there for free. Not a great view but I’m hoping the ease of access and low prices will get me some good business!
---
Death laws usually chap my nagahide
---
It also works on them if they're dead.
---
Omg thank you so much!
---
Good point. Anything priced for 25K in a camp vending machine will never sell.
---
sorry I,m ps4. I can lookat all pics from main menu (i think ). you must have something similar,but I dont need 76 to be running. they will be there somewhere, but getting 76 to re-regonizing them might be a different story. xb is microsoft,they don't know how do delete anything cos there is an easier option.just remove the reference to it.
---
Unsure I was also thinking it could be the newly added numberless vault to the north; I look around 76 for about 2 hours and gave up lol.
---
I'd clocked that too! It seems to be an intentional "loot boost" area since you're introduced there about the time a typical character starts to desperately need more stuff.
---
Great, that was fast!  Put that up in it's own post, I'm not alone in looking for that info.
---
Also confirmed no benches near my favorite lead farm location (monorail elevator near Whitespring).  Grrrrr....
---
Everyone camps at whitesprings, you should have known this before building in said spot
---
I wonder how many times I trudged over-encumbered right past a workbench. Something like this would be wonderful.
---
Thats a good idea, thank you ;)
---
Anything explosive breaks so much faster. Great gun your asking about, definitely worth using if you have the cards in the right area but you’ll be repairing it A LOT
---
Gauntlets are ridiculously powerful! Lots of points to spare since it only has so many perks so you can increase your defensive skills to make your survival almost guaranteed!
---
But to be fair almost anything, with the right gear, can be unstoppable
---
People asking question without searching subreddit history are the biggest anoyance....
---
And game is 600hours worth for me.
---
I'm enjoying selling all of my duplicate plans for incredibly cheap, as well as finally having a slightly regular way to purchase serums without being in the BOS
---
That's what I say. Basic bag gives+ 60 carry weight. With the mod the bag gives +30 and food durability
---
The Dragon is conspicuously missing from this list.
---
Ive used a tse level since early on and without the gunsmith perk I havent had this problem at all, one thing I do is the weapon artisan repair
---
Of course, they are a business. I never said they were a charity organization.
---
But I tend to give credit where credit is due.
---
Upvote this to infinite
---
I was able to take a photo by being near the start of the bridge at the ice cream shop. Took a picture where the ghouls spawn topside and it counted. This should be well doable now.
---
I see, you think that is intended?
---
He's posted it above!
---
Thanos wuz here **snap**
---
My brain. Made them by maxing out the light budget using 50 lightboxes.
---
I drowned spawning underwater running from a mirelurk
---
More than likely a bug. Will probably be patched in the coming update next week.
---
What?! I live right next to that cabin, and I’ve never seen one spawn there.
---
How much are you asking for it?
---
This literally has nothing to do with my post. It doesn’t matter how popular a spot is, it matters that the game keeps dumping the player in the same world even when you goose “find a new world”, or even in a different one that you’ll need to leave anyway, because your camp spot is still taken.
---
You will get your money out of it if you enjoyed any of the other fallout games or Bethesda titles.
---
I wish we had /u/Temporyl from the BFV sub. All he does is data mine
---
The day of the patch, I nuked the whitesprings. Walked into the zone... BOOM! Game crashes. Never been so sad before
---
Hahah. The ragdoll in rockstar games is priceless. 
---
Even “bad” moments like these are the funniest and best to witness
---
I have it on PS4. Also worth it for me
---
I admire your dedication good idea thanks
---
There are lots of them.  Check youtube for exact locations. Momover50gamer has tons of them.
---
Got a few people asking this so it might be something I'll have to look into - but unfortunately not for the foreseeable future. The data I'm working with currently is world objects, not enemy spawns. I'll keep the post updated if that changes though.
---
You mean, so much that they do archery without bow? or so much that they don't do testing and release update where you can't inspect the player vending weapons, when player aint near by? Or so much that they don't bother even thinking of basic UI/UX? Inspecting gear is bad design, that doesn't even work. Could just shown all effects, like the first perk is shown when weapon has been selected above other stats. They put effort, that they don't even bother checking if all released challenges can be even completed?
---
B#tch please, stop taking drugs. Not only is the content design is below average, the technical side doesn't even come to close to average. When normally you have to search bug, in here, you can't have any sessions without bugs.
---
I've been playing FO76 so long that I remember working escape artistan.
---
Weird. Started a few days for me. 
---
Guess I was lucky then
---
I'm pretty happy with the items they've introduced to the game so far. I'm also wondering if some of the things that I found in the game (notes, holo tapes, etc) that seemed to lead to a dead end is now something that will be picked up on in a later DLC (though I don't believe that has happened with the DLC that has been released so far). 
---
I think this game reminds of Age of Conan when it was released. There just wasn't much to do (actually a lot less than what FO76 offered out of the box, iirc). But they added on and from what I've heard it became an okay game.
---
Bought it for Xbox one on release day. Pain in the ass some days but I still dig the game itself in spite of all the bullshit. Opinions will be relative. Find it on sale and see for yourself. You should be able to get it cheap if you look around
---
my quest in data disappeared a few times, read the poster again and it will reappear
---
Someone was selling a +VATS, medic's, +VATS critical Fatman for 1000 caps, and no one bought it.
---
Power armor strength and endurance build. Have evasive (agility perk) and swing away.
---
It's getting better every patch.
---
Vending Machines are just a selling interface for your Stash.  Everything is still stored in your Stash.  And you can see them from your Stash anywhere in the world.
---
Your play style should dictate your build if you want to have fun. With the right gear, any build and play style can be powerful. Do you want to do ranged or melee? Sneak? Explosives? Medics/Utility?
---
Survivability can be achieved through a great many combinations of gear and perks, and a healthy mix of offense and defense. Personally, I run a VATs/Crit centric sneak build with rilfes and I switch between Rifleman and Commando depending on what I am trying to accomplish. This gives me lots of offense, and some passive defense in that I am typically operating in an undetected state and therefor not subject to damage from enemies until after I have already started dealing damage to them. 
---
There are lots of ways to play and be powerful.
---
Wait 'til Steam gets involved.
---
I'm set up between the Nuka Cola Plant and Camden Park. I had to server hop 4 times in a row to be able to get a server where my camp could be placed.
---
Hadn't played in a long while and didn't do any new quests. I stumbled onto a 1 star level 80 diseased one. Just shot spines at me as I stood on an outhouse lol
---
Oh dang that was fast. Now I want to go check out that random tinkers workbench in the far northeast of the map.
---
I feel your pain...   I have an alt character with 2H melee perks that was one level away from being able to use a bloodied buzzblade.  Same weap was giving around 128 ballistic dmg. + 60 or so  electric  dmg. on a different character without perks.  I was gutted that I never got to enjoy it in the hands of a an appropriately spec'd character.
---
Yeah.
---
In some ways, I don't mind.  It makes the whole repair thing a bit simpler, and now you don't have to account for your awesome weapon decaying to that point between 100-130% where it's doing normal damage, but you still can't repair it to get it back to 200%.
---
But all the V. Fast weapons need a buff to compensate for this, because this was quite literally the only way they were viable.
---
Great!
---
I've added it as a new section in the main post :)
---
I'm sorry that you are frustrated. I really am.
---
So... sorry.
---
What's the highest level for a drill?
---
Gotta be within range 20 yards. A scourge beast that’s landed. A vertibird at ammo factory or grafton steel. A cargo bot during collision course event.
---
Yeah I specifically avoid buying from these players and give them a thumbs down if they’re nearby. Most players have a switch for it though.
---
I understand, haven’t had this issue being placed in the same sever. Joining a world from friends list seems to work consistently though
---
I dont think it does. I visited a vending machine last night that had like 5 different spots taken up for spoiled meat/vegetables.
---
Info: just remember that Barbarian (Strenght) , Ironclad (endurance) &amp; Evesive (agility) only works outside of powerarmor.
---
Those eyes say so much and so little at the same time
---
100% interested depending on price lol let me know
---
Same, and I hope we’ll be able to merge camps with our friends to make one big settlement with trading posts
---
It's a plan it'not a mod ?
---
yes.  (re)load time just wasn't part of the question :)
---
servers will ATTEMPT to put you in a world your camp will build. also they will attempt to match you will others local to you.  you don't want logged on to server half way across the world, then you'll REALLY bitch about server lag.
---
have you built your camp where everyone else builds ?
---
Still none but don't dispair! We might eventually end up getting it
---
+1.
---
Its come a long way since launch, i personally enjoy it and enjoyed it during the rough stages in the beginning. Dont get me wrong theres still plenty of things that can be fixed and probably will but nothing that bad imo. Having bought games that were in the making and really rough (Ark when it first game to xbox one for example lol) bugs and stuff dont bother me. Most places sell it for $30-$40, id say itd be worth giving it a try, no one can make you like it!
---
Check this subreddit for "deposit map" or somethibg like that. Some super cool guy made map with dots of every deposit in game.
---
Coal is near poseidon powerplant for example.
---
Didnt the guy she was looking for disappear into the mine? (I think u might have to kill him)
---
got it.
---
I updated my post: I like melee
---
Holy crap I didn't even notice that!
---
Exactly.
---
Its crazy how many of these post there are, seems like every day more people start playing. I remember beta and was worried the game would go nowhere. This is a great sign.
---
Cran bog, north western part. Near a dump truck on its side half buried. Also near one of the power towers.
---
they were redacted in the code. It's probably because BGS wanted us to find and decode it, which is now backed up by the mysterious holotapes appearing around the map, and how they tie into Nuclear winter
---
Interesting.  But what would cause her to mutate into one?  All we know is she was critically wounded, by them at the B&amp;B.
---
Or maybe she decided to hide inside one of their outfits while recovering.
---
Then you get enough badges to get backpack out of the machine?
---
If you only do PVE power armor is probably the easiest way.  Just level up in the melee categories and you should be able to kick mucho ass. 
---
\-Blocker
---
\-Incisor
---
\-Swing Speed perk (can't remember name of it)
---
\-Gladiator **OR** Slugger 
---
Shotgun perks synergize nicely with the strength category as well if you more into a ranged build.
---
It would be nice if you could at least choose the weapon, this system is worst case scenario. Even with max scrip you'll be lucky to get one copy of the gun you're looking for.
---
I like the thunder mountain workshop. Has an extractor (not the main source but still handy), and any time it gets attacked you jut fight the things off and scrap it. Not to mention you get extra fusion cores, nuclear waste etc. 
---
Also you help out anyone who puts their camps near Thunder Mountain substations and other workshops which have power supplied from there!
---
+1
---
Wow insane, out of the 20 or so times I've done it, I got 2 badges. I was thinking it was limited to one a day.
---
I remember a 400lb stash.   Hard times.
---
PS4 explains some of the difference but even then a BE handmade for 3k is a steal. Congrats. They typically go for 20-25k on ps4.
---
There never been a better time to make caps.... Sell things
---
That worked my dude ;). Ty
---
It doesn’t matter how popular a spot is? You haven’t tried camping at the Snake I guess. Someone is there in every server. Camp spots with Water and resource nodes are extremely limited, and often in use.
---
What about *the pepper man?*
---
Yeah, did that. The plans were hard to come by. Not now though 😊
---
We just need fast travel mats... As long as the camp owner isn't an ass and puts it on the edge of a cliff or something, it'll fix this issue.
---
Seriously.  This is probably my most memorable experience playing any of the GTAs.  (Granted I remember only the stupidest shit from GTAs, like the Lance Vance Dance and "descend from the rafters... like a bat!)
---
He became infected with the Scorched Plague and she locked him in a room for the Dwellers to find and deal with
---
Here's a video I made to help spread it to other communities on YouTube, thanks to all the info from this thread 
---
https://youtu.be/ZA86bHJH34U
---
It shoots like a shotgun but more or less it's like a two shot multiplied to 4-5 beams? I don't believe shotgun perks apply because I have a high range and it reaches further out than a shotgun. So far the durability has been the same compared to my ultracite two shot laser.
---
Rail road,robot and pic are some of the easiest ones.
---
YES AND I WILL USE MY POWER TO 1 SHOT THE QUEEN AAAALLLL THE ULTRACITE IS MIIIIIIINE HAHAH
---
😊 👍
---
I found some sweet stuff at the Whitesprings vendors. That was back before people realized you could inspect legendaries to see the extra stars. Lol
---
hey, what is ur gtag (ps4, xbox or pc)?
---
I just used 3 dif characters to go pick one up 😂 just need 2 more !
---
If they attempted, it would happen. Getting put in the same server several times in a row when I specifically chose an option that state it will place me in a different server... doesn’t make sense. There are other servers.
---
At the end of her personal journal quest yes.  I believe she finds him and locks him inside the room because she cannot bring herself to kill him.  Leaving a holotape asking us (who ever finds it) to finish it for her.
---
But later in the non-personal one, we find she is trapped by some mole miners and hurt badly.  Leaving us to believe she possibly did not recover.  (Though, we find another holotape later that leads us to question that).
---
Read the freaking responses to this question that is asked every damned day . Use your own judgement
---
Lmao I did exactly this yesterday
---
THANK YOU! I made a similar reply to a post that complained about these types of questions.
---
Insulated gives you 90 radiation resistance and lead lined gives you 90 energy resistance.
---
It happened on Easter too for me as well. The queen needed like 100 more Gatling gun shots then it would’ve died
---
Mine is situated at the stairs leading up to the kitchen of my establishment, and shall remain there. It's company policy to maintain a relatively clean and sterile cooking environment to prevent customers from getting ill from our food.
---
The Combat Knife and Ski Sword are nice, but in general, one-handed is comprised of 80% joke weapons.
---
90 caps at vendor now as the other guy said at grafton
---
Can I join? I am always down for some Pandemic. I can bring the expansions!
---
This player mist be found so photos and videos of the camp can be shared. This kind of dedication deserves notice on here
---
Can help you if you still need it.
---
I've been playing on PS4 since launch it's a great game. I don't regret my purchase it keeps getting better.
---
Yeah, it's a paint job. I was hoping it was a damage mod. 😕
---
What is it? The attack items, scorched ashes, or behemoth body parts?
---
It’s all fun and games until someone be shitting cement scrap
---
Plausible.  We don’t know the outcome of the mole miner or her so it’s theory but a good one. Maybe after she recorded the holotape the mole miner came back to finish the job and she iced it and took its clothes.
---
Nice I'm always up for a challenge thanks for all the info. for some reason I can't follow you but I'd love to just to see all the info as you find it.
---
Well you can see a screenshot, i posted it in a reply to OP. It's always fighting Super Mutants/Scorched. In fact, every single time i walk through that area there are always 2 factions fighting. Since the Sheepshquatch was added it's the most common encounter i have in that area.
---
I think the extra size one is 8 points, so you're going to need to grind the daily bug-hunt and/or do campfire tales and hope you get possum points from those.   
---
Plan on it taking a long while.
---
I need the same for Xbox.  Maybe we should have a specific thread for all swimmer badge seekers?
---
Make sure that you are using photo mode, not the actual camera item. If the challenge says photomode it is talking about the first screenshot function that was in the game before they added the prosnap camera.
---
Interesting to know. Thanks.
---
Holy fuuuuudge. Yeah with the adrenaline single star it was peaking at 67 damage. Still 200 percent it'll take out ghouls faster than my executioners 3* baseball bat. That one does 180 dmg per swing at 40% reduced swing speed.
---
He's talking about a ZAX most likely inside Vault 51
---
Yeah man!
---
They are as of right now, cuz I keep forgetting, ganna forget again later tonight. But I have the big windows you can jump through. Otherwise I will be at my base so people can inspect items (that's what heard at least, how you can inspect)
---
Yea I plan on getting it for my second build it just takes so long to level up :(
---
Yep. Takes a few hrs to complete 3 challenges. I suggest doing the archery, athletics, and swimming challenges
---
Nope, it’s CaptainModrah
---
No Alien Blaster or Enclave Plasma Gun, that's annoying x3
---
But at least Scout Armor is there.
---
depends on what you mean by survive! PVE, definitely, PVP probably not! But your new set looks pretty good +60% damage and the addition of the explosive damage should make short work of most things! I play and use a normal LMG without any commando perks and I do fairly ok, saying that I do use all legendary armour. 
---
Regardless I'd say play it and if you enjoy it stick with it! Best build is the build you enjoy!
---
there is a cloud option, that might work, all 'your' data gets saved to cloud backup.
---
I think that is mainly up to Sony at this point because every other major system has declared they are open to it (Steam, nintendo, microsoft) but Sony refuses for security reasons of some sort. They have been wavering lately though as more people call for it.
---
Big F for all of the junk I had to leave behind
---
yes 
---
name zamas9090
---
I would find it strange for the overseer to get injured by mole men and then dress up like one of them to sell us legendary weapons for a special mole man currency that can only be obtained by destroying legendarys..
---
Just seems like a strange side step from her normal goals and aspirations of recovering Appalachia to making a profit of mole man currency off of vault dwellers.
---
You were at my base? Where is it?
---
It happened and I laughed my ass off
---
Yeah I think the point is that getting an absolute god mode 3* legendary SHOULD be annoying and grindy. However, the previous system of farming legendary enemy locations was just stupid. At least this has more definitive "drops" and much better odds.
---
It sucks but I would blame Bethesda more than the players. Mobs shouldn’t be spawning every time or every second time a player visits another’s camp.
---
Is your Mother in-law really that bad
---
Responses like yours dont inspire people to try the game out. He's asking a legit question and instead of shuffling through the myriad of bullshit posts that
---
a) Serve only as a circle jerk for players who aren't capable of critique 
---
and
---
b) Serve only as a bitch fest from frustrated players who rage at every single problem
---
they come in and ask this question. **This is a good thing** because someone is interested again and looking to pick it up. If we start off their Fallout 76 journey with "AHH YOU'RE SO ANNOYING FOR EVEN ASKING THIS" what type of environment should they expect once they pay for the game?
---
Im a new player but have been lurking here for quite some time. What got me to finally buy the game a week or so ago was the friendliness of the community to a certain post.
---
I love this site:  [https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/) 
---
Little Boy and Fat Man were nothing compared to the damage we could do now.
---
Dead stuff still counts for the challenges. So punch that dumb bat in the face and snap a pic of its stupid corpse.
---
I hate it when that happens man, servers were really unstable the day of the patch lol
---
Sent you a message. Will definitely visit the shop later.
---
There are 2-3 coal deposits on the West side of train tracks at Pleasant Valley Station (Top of the World area). I know because my camp is there, and I hit it up frequently since I stumbled upon them awhile back. If you cross the little orangeish red trolley bridge you went too far. To the left before the bridge.
---
Fantastic map,I just had a look, only prob is I’m colour blind and junk, copper and coal all look exactly the same colour lol, but I’m in the Mire atm and if I can’t find the one here then il try the cranberry bog truck someone mentioned, at least they exist lol
---
I've been pretending that if the shopkeeper isn't on-site to properly show me their wares that I must instead just look through the window and try to guess :/
---
Especially ticks coming out of nowhere and then me freaking tf out
---
I had 5 "Can't Place Your Camp" in a row this morning.  Finally, decided to look at the map and found more than a half dozen vendors had opened up in the vicinity where my camp should have been.   Restarted the Bethesda app and got a less populated map (and my camp, too).
---
I could always sell the alien blaster... Lol
---
Just bad RNG.  I was lucky enough to receive 6 yesterday, while my brother got none whatsoever.
---
DPS as i know is Damage Per Second, if u tell the reload dont count so maybe youi are talking about Damage per Shot, this way of course Dragon is the best one, i have 2:
---
Instigating explo, base dmg (with right perks) 700 x2 from first shot as instigating effect x2.5 from stealth
---
TSE Dragon base dmg (with right perks) 1070, x2.5 from stealth perk.
---
cool join me
---
Makes a change from the normal vendors. More of a mixed bag and not so samey.
---
OP, its 100% worth it if you're looking for that good Fallout experience. Im sure you have seen plenty of videos where people found bugs and it was at one point a hot mess.
---
Those days are over.
---
The game has been significantly worked on and its still being worked on.
---
I played World of Warcraft in vanilla and that game had more issues than Marvel comics. But I gave it a good chance and I ended up falling in love with it. Im sure you'll fall in love with Fallout 76.
---
Grab the game and jump right in. There is LOTS to do.
---
He's looking for Vault 76 though. That's why he's talking about Reclamation Day. I think the "Tower, river, fork" means he started at the tower at Morgantown airport, followed the river, then followed the right fork.
---
He's trying to get help to dismantle / combat the ZAX in charge of the Vault he is from.
---
Brilliant, thanks a lot, really appreciate it
---
I'm right there with you lol 4 mules maxed stash, 1400+ character weight...it's sad. It's gonna take me FOREVER to get rid of everything lol but at least I get to roll 3 star for a looooong time :D
---
THIS
---
Not your screenshots as far as I know.  You can't upload screenshots the same way you can save data.  Now if my photo-mode shots are in my little save data that's different!
---
Yea this..I actually grinded 4 events and got the armor first. Have done the side missions, camp fire tales/bug/cleanup, about a 9 times now and haven't gotten a point from them.
---
This was happening *before* the patch. The unrealistic expectation here is that the behavior has somehow stopped.
---
West Tek is usually good but its a *hit or miss* because sometimes you get no legendaries, but sometimes you get a good amount
---
I'm glad you remembered! That's actually the fourth option over LOL I felt so stupid last night, I was like I look at this pip-boy every day but when I try to tell someone something about it, I'm like derrrr, how do I button my shoelaces?! lol
---
Plus you can do the Survival challenges for the Resolute Veteran in adventure mode this week for some reason and get an awesome Gatling Gun
---
I did the event at the Morgantown airport lol
---
Mobs still can. Had a mole rat stroll into my house recently and try to wreck my shit.
---
Well the mole trader is a female so.. would make sense 😮
---
Dps is probably right but Railway rifle beats anything but melee for efficiency. You can literally grind westtek and come out with more ammo then you went in with. I easily make 1000 steel per run. Each run is around 900 new rounds of ammo and I can also har est spent ammo from the dead super mutants.
---
No drill or syringer.... wonder if that means they’ll finally be out of legendary pool?
---
Bloodied deathclaw gauntlet  with unyielding armor easy 500 damage
---
Remember when you’d find paper bags or containers full of random good stuff that can’t be sold to vendors? The amount of times I found 600+ shotgun shells just laying around... Now you’re lucky to buy ammo for a cap a piece, and even that feels like too much in most cases.
---
Would like to see a spiral staircase. The current options of steps are very clunky.
---
I found a coal deposit right across from Poseidon Energy plant - [https://imgur.com/AX9cXYZ](https://imgur.com/AX9cXYZ) Its right where my character is
---
What's in the beyond section?
---
nope. ZAX inside Vault 51
---
It resets every 20 hours, like vendors..?
---
Aye I’ll try restarting the launcher, I’ve only tried restarting the game and that doesn’t help. Only thing that’s worked so far is persistence or waiting half an hour. I’ll try restarting the launcher and see if it helps, thanks.
---
That’s why I began to sell them in my vending machine;)
---
Total worth.  I got it a month after launch and have over 400 hours in. There are still bugs but things have gotten much better
---
You know, I was considering this last night. If people use their scrip and roll 3 star, we'll see A LOT of weapons and armor that people don't want for sale at player vending machines. It's going to be kind of neat, honestly. I'm sure we'll run across combinations we didn't even THINK would be a thing lol RNGeesus be with us!
---
servers and their recources are quite finite, and probably stretched at times,hence 'server lag'.
---
how do you know your being placed on the same server ? and might be still, this is whats available take it or leave it.
---
post doesn't say your loc..... uk servers , I think, there is 4 banks.
---
Full endurance tree, do like a nocturnal pipe pistol with mysterious stranger lol
---
I guess this will be the only way for Pipe Revolvers?
---
Wouldn't you like to shoot all day....
---
I have read threads about west tek being a good farming spot, I have made runs there alot, more often than not I don't find legendaries. I agree with hit and miss, just more miss.
---
Gotta make those repair kits viable somehow :/
---
I made a tower base that’s currently hollow in the center in anticipation of elevators being added at a later date. It wold take less build budget to add one or two elevators than it would for the amount of stairs and floor pieces I need to reach the top.
---
Shoot or Fast Travel Mats. Who needs Elevators when you can Teleport to the top! 
---
Seriously though Elevators would be real slick looking.
---
Cool. I have 3 explosive guns for sale
---
Did you get it? If it works for you then it will prove that it’s a bug. Didn’t try to replicate it (I only have one FO76 account).
---
Your one of my favorite players I've never had the pleasure of playing with..guys this guy is litteraly a MVP on ps4 always up to something cool
---
looks great!
---
Now this is just amazing I know I find it hard to find recourses sometimes (because of my baby brain compacity) so I can’t wait to use this!
---
Love this idea.  Identification of trends can allow us vendors to stock more relevant stuff in our machines.  Thumbs up.
---
I agree! That was surprisingly reasonable. I thought for sure it would be like 1500 scrip for a random gamble and random star thing. We all were speculating, but it's nice to see it's reasonable. That's a much welcomed surprise!
---
the duped Bloodied/swingspeed/str powerfist with a puncturing mod will still be king of dps :D
---
So I listen to the holotape closely and thought about what he said he just sort of appeared in the middle of West Virginia after the bombs were dropped so I'm wondering where did he come from was it possible that he was on a crashed space station? He's obviously talking about mobius being the bucket of bolts because that's the one that dropped the nukes, but if this guy was a part of dropping the nukes because he talks about all the lives he took and then he randomly ended up in West Virginia leaves a lot to wonder where it came from.
---
i think its ok if you are a man and want to dress as a woman, who am i to judge?
---
It still pleases me every time I hear the \*ding\* of a sale. No mater how few caps I earned, every \*ding\* helps me and someone else. 
---
I'll still wander a minute out of my way to visit a camp with vending; or I'll visit any camp next to Vault 76, since it's free to travel there.   
---
Yes, there are lots of over-priced goods, but there are still some great deals out there.
---
Yes!! I just don't want your weapons to go to waste because if 20 armors went to waste at 3 scrip a piece, that's 60 scrip and possibly a 3 star armor that you (or someone else) might love and really want/need. I had to send a kind of SOS alert based on eckserah's datamine about it. Seemed like the thing to do lol
---
ah, my buddy learned that last night when we returned to finish that section of the quest.  I turned my stuff in and he couldn't. 
---
uh, oh...  You didn't scrap all did ya, bro...?  :P
---
*opens incognito*

Fappalachia.

I think a Ninja build is pretty cool, and gives you bonus damage for being sneaky, which in turn affords you some additional passive defense in not being the target of your enemies' attacks. So either way, you will want plenty of points in strength to boost whichever melee weapon type you end up settling on. You will also want to save room in luck for your Starched Genes and Class Freak points (melee benefits a ton from mutations) as well as Bloody Mess for a nice 15% damage increase across the board. From there, you can grab the Ninja perk from AGI along with Sneak and Escape Artist to make it more viable. You can also snag a couple of nice defensive perks in there in Dodgy and Born Survivor since you cannot apply a stim while melee attacking.
---
Something like this build:  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1865d8&amp;d=l71lt2lu2ao0aj2ar2i44s52ss2se2sj2si2eo2ej4a12cm0cu1c81a82&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1865d8&amp;d=l71lt2lu2ao0aj2ar2i44s52ss2se2sj2si2eo2ej4a12cm0cu1c81a82&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=) 
---
With the right mutations and a healthy supply of Whiskey, you could be killing everything before it even knows you're there.
---
There was a darker paint called coal something. I think it was 1400 but I can’t find it now.
---
They said in the patch notes that was a mistake and they wouldn't actually work together.
---
Mine doesn't do that, but you do if you want to use my bed or terminal. You want to get in my bed, you will clean yourself damnit.
---
Can confirm. Do this. 🤣
---
I would rather have Fast Travel mats and deal with the few trolls that try to trap you.
---
Yup. I'm a big fan of fo4 and I got scared off by the reviews for fo76. I still wanted to buy it after patches and on sale and I'm sure there are more people like me.
---
They corrected their comment about them working in PA. Apparently they’re not and weren’t supposed to.
---
That's a great lookin store.
---
To clarify, you can build normal stairs and all other versions of them, but just not the one with posts?
---
Similar to the Red Stove... Many people bought the Red Stove skin but hadn't bought/found/read the standard Stove Plan so they had the same situation you seem to be having.
---
I have been playing since launch and love it. Even with the early issues .
---
funny thing Op actually renamed his PSN recently when they allowed people to change them, you dont even WANT to know what his old, even more offensive PSN id was....
---
EDIT:   Meant to say my photo mode shots
---
&gt; tranquility.lane restart
---
Oh, thats bad.
---
Well i will try to describe coal deposit location the best i can.
---
When you are looking on map, under poseidon powerplant is river, with pararel road and trainroad. Coal deposit is located in that little D shaped cross of train and road. It looks like other deposits. Hole with black rocks inside. It took me while to actualy find it there, so good luck.
---
There's got to be other ways, cause it's impossible to get everything from the vendor with only the world challenges
---
I got it too.  Had no idea what happened until I read this post.  I sold it in my vending machine.
---
It will but one maintenance has already come and gone so don’t hold your breath.
---
Yes that’s it. But I have the “stairs with posts” unlocked for the normal skin.
---
Yeah well reddit history is... chaotic to say the least. It's hard to gauge which complaints are still relevant.
---
That is the one thing good about minecraft.  
---
You can have pressure platest that auto close doors behind you.
---
"I don't want you to use nukes, but take that legendary fat man, just in case"
---
Good for you! You are a great, helpful player. Too bad I'm on xbox!
---
I don’t think that it is linking properly to the shop
---
I think the BE handmade has the highest potential DPS in the game.
---
It's broken, half of them won't register at all. Just wait for the patch.
---
Folks like me that didn't get to play in the beta, but were here on DAY ONE of release have been hoarding things LOL so 6 months of hoarding :D  
---
I learned in Dust 514 that you must cherish EVERYTHING in a video game, especially specialty items and farming everything and hoarding everything is always always always the best policy lol **no matter what**
---
Bah how can everyone have done this event!?? I’ve yet to see it activate when I play..is there a certain time of day it happens? Or evening?
---
Using super duper perk will also give you a chance of doubling your 80%
---
A good way to make sure you end up on a different server is to use your friends list to join their server if you land in one where your CAMP spot is taken. I'll chose the option to stay on that world, open up the menu, see who's on a different server, then presto changeo my CAMP is back.
---
I very rarely team up, but I've found having an extensive friends list is very helpful for server hopping.
---
not something I use, but could also try a usb stick. screen shots are in a folder,you could try back up that.
---
I would need to sit and play around with ps4,but unable at this time
---
best of
---
The issue is more with how the shop summary on the map is displayed.  If outfits are sold, It tallies them as armor on the info panel.
---
yeah it happened to me when I tried to share a perk while not in a party .. fixed it by waiting until my buddy joined teamed up with him had him share a level 1 perk then I was able to share my rank 2 perk without the popup message telling me about needing charisma
---
Sort by "new". Like how can you guys play such complex RPG when you can't google simple thing? :D
---
I have some scorched ashes but no clue how I got them, is there more info about it?
---
Langoliers. Run.
---
That's too bad. Maybe tag a Bethesda Community Manager in a comment.
---
It's the one piece of information that one would have to rely on to say the two are the same person.
---
But it's a stretch on its own.  Since presumably half the population of Appalachia would also have been.
---
Even less likely since we have indication of what happened to her after the mole miner attack, where she is sound of mind, disappointed with us, and still dedicated to her original mission.
---
Is there any way to get a higher resolution of the maps? I'm dumb
---
RemindMe! 7 hours
---
Are you on PS4?
---
That's a hell of a tombstone
---
It was a joke.  I'm sure there's a word for it.  Irony maybe?  Satire but positive?  Something like that.
---
I'm one of those thoughtless ones honestly (though stuff like this reminds me and my friend who complains about it not cause monsters get inside but just cause he likes to rp being annoyed about it). But I do it to my own camp too. To the point that I came home one time and some one had closed my door and it kinda shocked me for a sec (used to just running in).
---
I agree. I’m seeing the same items sold for far more than it well should be.  
---
With everyone selling meta weapons and armour non meta stuff doesn’t seem to be in demand. 
---
Like one guy was selling nothing but instigating mini guns. At 6000 caps. Why?!?!
---

Hey Pulowski, how come your Personal Shelters don't actually protect from radiation or Scorchbeast attacks?!  Are you just pulling our post-Apocalyptic legs or what?
---
Theyre on the ground in the helvetia church, i think its just a world object that shouldnt be able to be picked up but for whatever reason you can. I have 25 of them :p
---
They’re probably going to spread them out to make it seem like they’re constantly making new stuff.
---
Thanks ever so much that’s really helpful 👍
---
Given we have a name for the Purveyor, Purveyor Murmrgh, I think it can be soundly said that this isn't the case.
---
I'm PS4 - jacktriphyllum
---
I'm on my way out of town, so unfortunately I will not be online till Tues.  Which is killing me. Lol. If my PS4 setup wasn't hardwired and set up behind my TV on the wall, I would take it with me.
---
[Here you are](https://i.imgur.com/v9I0Llr.jpg)
---
It's worth noting though, that the game doesn't have as many explicit Dog Food spawns as it does just generic "packaged food" spawns. These may not always be Dog Food and may be other prewar foods, but are worth checking.
---
Vanguard melee all the way.
---
&gt; We don’t know the outcome of the mole miner or her so it’s theory but a good one. 
---
Well, we do know she survives, and is still sound of mind and is starting to be aware of our character and their actions.  And has not abandoned her original goal.
---
I only remembered it because I thought it was funny as the word "collections" has such a negative connotation for us adults who struggle to pay the bills lol
---
Stick with the same, you run out of ideas and keep repeating the same.  
---
How pathetic can you be?  
---
At least one reason you filthy noob, tell me, argue me with something solid, not a stupid thought about me sucking at pvp, what about if i or not in pvp ? it's OK we all have the right to suck, who the hell think you are?. 
---
Explain to me something filthy casual, how the frick can someone suck in PvP when you can easily have the most broken gear and the game allows you to cheat legally?
---
Thanks, I'm looking for this kind of info!
---
I'm all for coming back to wasteland, but I've kind of played fo4 to death and I can't play it anymore since every update to shop seems to screw up my mod list. 
---
Besides, now that I have a ps4, I'm wondering whether it's worth it to go for the console version. I'm really liking the thought of spending countless hours on my couch instead of being slouched by my desk like I already am at work.
---
Quad? I want bloodied or instigating or even furious. Or one of each!
---
Not a problem
---
Theyre ok..but i feel like i have to make my base bigger than i really want to juat to accomodate a staircase.
---
u/Valseek u/Ladydevon
---
Shit I thought that was a bug, no wonder it wouldn't work.
---
Yeah you never know what you will find...  Possible exception for shops that are super close to train stations.  I've been consistently finding price-gouging at those lol
---
Yea but they can update this anytimee
---
I went in today just to grab a few materials for flux, and ran into about 5-6 with barely a full pass.
---
Unfortunately half of them were one star wood armor. I thought people were joking about wood armor drop rates... I was wrong.
---
This gives the no power armor people some balance with carry weight
---
From my understanding, you cannot transfer scrip. BUT you can likely transfer items you get from the Purveyor. So I guess it's just personal preference if you want to transfer them to your main or not....BUT, beware of this:  
---
My main is level 167.   
---
Every mule I have is level 9-15 (somewhere in there)  
---
Wouldn't it stand to reason if I used the mules to get legendary weapons and armors, they would be mule levels instead of main levels?   
---
I feel like that's the difference between AMAZING level 50 dream weapon/armor and level 10 dream weapon/armor...waaah waaaah waaaaaaaaah
---
Oh, i know that. If it helps others,of course include it. I was just chiming in with my own personal story.
---
The compression on Imgur is making so,e of the maps difficult to read. Awesome job
---
PS4, Tuesday June 18th, 5PM CST
---
Thank you, really appreciate the description, with everyone’s help I’ve now got the photo and a new handy coal supply for serum crafting,
---
Couldn’t agree more. I wouldn’t mind if the double foundation stairs had flooring options aside from the grated material tho
---
What on earth is going on at the 65 sign north of Watoga? I’ll have to check that area out later.
---
\*shakes fist with bathrobe slightly ajar\*
---
come on black powder pistol FUCK I GOT A 10mm AGIAN DAMNIT
---
Bummer for the Combat Armor fans, but great news for us Enclave scouts!
---
Boy oh boy Bethesda just can't resist bugging one limb of a set, can they.
---
Yeah, I'm thinking most people are using the most effective ammo. I mainly use 5.56 but am trying to branch out since I have loads of other ammo just by random pilfering. I'm quite the wasteland hoarder...even if I don't need something from that toolbox, I take it ALL. Lol
---
Are you asking me or telling me I’m confused? Because that’s what I was assuming but wasn’t sure
---
Yea thats what i was curious about. If my lvl2 can buy a lvl50 lol. Ill probably wait to see..maybe keep 100scrip on one just to try.
---
Wait you get badges from the events and repeatable quests? If so I’ll feel very dumb.
---
I'm sure it will be fixed.  Currently you cannot Inspect unless the owner is at their CAMP.  If they are there, you can Inspect.  So it appears to be a bug.
---
I meant as in a timeline sense. As you can go after her tapes anytime. After you nuke, far before. It’s my understanding that she must have encountered mole miners while searching for Evan or before.
---
That happens off and on, not much can be done because he'll just return to the same spot.
---
OP confirms that it was his typo and has updated the list.
---
Yes! I've seen a tameable level 20 as well as a tameable level 76 diseased one
---
Someone said that is already happening. Bunch of people built right on the edge of a cliff, and when people spawn in they die.
---
Another funny one is (So I heard on Reddit) that someone build their vendor on a platform off the edge of a cliff. And when they log out, people get to test out gravity with no warning.
---
My pleasure! Stop by anytime you see me on. :)
---
I don't even care if you're a guy,  I love you for this comment
---
Ok thanks
---
25% to get possum badge by completing both daily quests or event: campfire tales.
---
I was grinding that event whole day and made 12badges.
---
Temporary disable, no reason given. Speculation is an exploit or dupe related to it.
---
Great! I should be on for a good chunk of time tonight.
---
Since part of the player quest is to finish the work on the Scorch vaccine she will most likely if still roaming around Appalachia become a scorched like that lady in the Bog/Mire
---
Melee and unkillable armors all the way. You can be powerful even with a rolling pin. Don’t use range weapons they are less powerful, high maintenance and you have to craft ammo for them all the time, unless shooting is your thing.
---
I think thats what it was, but it really messes with value that i keep seeing these people. Last night around midnight i found another for 10k (much more realistic price).
---
 I have to assume the dupers have capped out on all their characters an now just wanted clear of their merchandise but not destroyed all in the scrip.
---
The guy had some crazy prices the other night. 200 for serum, * for 25 ** for 150 *** for 400
---
He came from Vault 51, the bucket of bolts hes referring to is a ZAX
---
Yea I did it again yesterday and it passed me on the 12th try! I tried everything and tbh I have no clue why I passed it all of a sudden. I was having issue with the buoy farthest right from the dock. So I starting going to that one first. About 9 times in a row it failed me right off the rip after going around that buoy! My buddy loaded up his alt to do it and was having the same issues. Then same as me it just worked all of a sudden. I tried to stay in the water as well and you really can’t do it without touching the ground in about 60% of the marks!
---
Great post!  👍
---
just visual
---
Funny enough, I build my camp just on the Western side below the Top of The World, right near a SB rift and I've yet to have any bother my camp. Plenty of greenskins though.
---
Thank you! I love it.
---
This is... upsetting
---
Umm unless gladiator applies I think I have a single point gladiator card. I'd have to double check
---
My tank is Charlie Sheen from Ferris Beuller. Walks around in greaser outfit.
---
Tbh I kinda wish that taking damage while doing that stuff kicks you out of it instead of ignoring it. 
---
Oh what’s that? Getting stabbed in the back by a radscorpion better ignore it to craft this gun.
---
Apparently you do. It's a small chance but it's there. I have yet to get any from them but others are saying you can.
---
Check your effects tab under status... You may have an effect that's reducing your Charisma.
---
The work should have been doing this work before the launch.
---
it's a Battle Royale
---
DIIIIIAAABEEEEEETUUUUSS
---
These are awesome!
---
One comment—can you do one with tarberry locations? I have the worst luck finding those. I usually buy them from vendor bots when they have a couple. As dumb as that is.
---
If they’re already labeled and I just overlooked it let me know :)
---
So the dailys do have a chance to drop some? Because like I said, I got nothing from them when I did them again. Also, where is this event? I haven't seen it and this is the first I heard of it. Surely the event would be easier to farm.
---
I have seen this posted a few times. 
---
About 1-2 months ago a newly skinned version of Stairs w/Posts and regular was added to the game files. They added the newly skinned regular stairs to the Atomic Shop for purchase, but the newly skinned Stairs W/Posts only shows up for sale in the BUILD menu for Workshops and Camps.  
---
It seems like the bug is allowing you to buy the new skin for the Stairs W/Posts in the build menu before it acatially avaiblw to buy within the Atomic Shop. 
---
Case in point.. you can both buy the new skin for the Regular Stairs and also build it in a Camp or Workshop. You cannot buy the Stairs W/Post skin in the Atomic Shop or can build it in a Camp or a Workshop.
---
Glitched but technically not unique, I have two tesla rifles with "scope" as the sights attachment. It shouldn't exist, but does so anyway
---
Other than that, also two piles of scorched ashes
---
yep. Thanks for the work man
---
This is great. Thanks
---
Good to know I’ll stop by them if I see them in the meanwhile I’ll be doing annoying challenges
---
It resets like vendors. You’re going back too soon.
---
Um I think I have gladiator, electrified mod, and with adrenaline it goes up to about 67 dmg. On top of that when its above 160%condition it does way more damage but after that it drops quite a bit.
---
I’ve found alpha and Charlie, haven’t found Bravo yet but I’ll keep looking
---
Okay thank you!
---
Just a heads up but I think this only covers crafting benches in the overworld. That's fine enough I guess but if you're like me you don't mind entering a building to scrap your crap so places like the Brotherhood Asylum and the Whitespring's Artisan Corner (not pictured) can be godsends if and when you're overburdened... which for me is quite a bit.
---
Ok thx
---
I have some ripper mods, haven't had luck finding one worth keeping.
---
But they didn't. They are doing it now.
---
You can either accept that, or cry about it.
---
Clearly dude hasn't played the latest Assassin's Creed. You can't die from fall damage. Like, at all.
---
Both reduce carry weight by 30?
---
Thanks for the heads up. Untill they fix it I guess I'll only visit Camp's if the owners are there.
---
Camp Adams I believe?
---
Oh thx
---
I don't think anyone with 400k caps is playing this game legit. 
---
I've been playing since day one, killing scrapping and selling everything I can both in-game and on reddit for literally months. Although my total wealth would well exceed max caps I'd be highly impressed if I and my other 3 team mates have 50k each on both alts (we each have 2 for 8) 
---
I'd argue that 400k to a single player is near impossible without some kind of cheating/exploit/duping. 
---
Prove me wrong. I'd love to see proof
---
Server hop at camp adams. You will trigger it once you get on server where is currently night.
---
I haven’t heard, but I think it’s inevitable
---
Lol I know now. You told me in a message. But thanks for correcting this as it's better to know what it is exactly rather than let your mind wonder
---
They can be tedious yes. Some has things that are very rare or not even available yet.
---
No triple A studio just gives up on a major online title no matter what happens, no matter how negative the backlash. These games are meant to bring in money and they do regardless of the critique. It would be more impressive if they pushed the release a year and launched the game with all of this on it already. Would have been a better game, would have got better reviews and bethesda and fallouts reputation would have been intact.
---
If they were really committed to the games they make, companies would stop doing the "Ship it we will fix it later" approach. They just want to get their game out. It's about $ not enjoyment. Imagine all the resales of people that got rid of the game and now want to come back because it is "Getting Fixed" honest people that just love the FO universe, getting sucked back in.
---
I've been trying to come up with a full list as well but someone did mention the molerat which seemed off, mostly was hoping for mothman but that will probably be a special event.
---
Let me know when you get that other post up giving away all the info you have
---
I just never scrap armour, I just sell it to a vendor or so, because I'm too scared it'll glitch and get rid of my jumpsuit 😂 jokes on me!
---
That is probably it I'm currently addicted to booze. Thanks a bunch!
---
Lol I'm selling a Tse black powder pistol for like 3k,
---
I once found base some guys must of used for fighting the scorchbeast queen made entirely out of foundations.  It was one of the first ones i had seen of it’s kind.  I had gotten quite lucky in the game early on finding a x-01 jetpack early on and was able to access the entrance.
---
There was several brown paper bags around with many stable flux’s and bobbleheads like over 30 leader bobbleheads.  I’m sure a lot of the items i found were duped ones but it was so early in the game i didn’t know anything about that stuff and there was no one around, so i just grabbed all the items and ran.
---
No love for the black powder blunderbuss :( 
---
But awesome to see pipe revolver and the scout armor get added!
---
They either don't have the caps or are just building their own guns and unlocking mods on their own as they level. Think about what you were doing at level 20, probably questing and grinding xp. My best sales are in ammo and plans so maybe grab a few workshops with lead and steel extractors and grind out ammo chems and plans from the defend the workshop events.
---
Still holding out hope that they have something planned for it down the road where we can upgrade it to its former glory
---
It's part of the campfire tales event it's not called terrorist after dark but when you start the quest the scout leader announces the tape is called terrorist in the dark.

Are these actually going to be legendary? Is there a way to check to see if these will actually become legendary or should I expect to see some no-star items in my purchases? I have never even seen any legitimate player with a UGL or Bone Hammer in my 600+ hours out in the wasteland. I really hope they fix the old weapon bugs before the 16th but I feel like we aren't getting another patch until the 21st...
---
It's pretty perfect compared to other MMOs
---
PSN pirateglenn1 - selling weapons and ammunition
---
Nope lol! I'm going to send a ticket in to Bethesda to let them know what's going on
---
yup.  me.
---
Gets me everytime!
---
Man I know! I swooped up ALOT of good 2* and 3* at the ws vendors. Then that damn update, now people are selling a shit 1* for 4K. Yeah eat shit on that. But Iv also gotten a TSE 2* combat shotgun from someone for like 700
---
Yep. Also the deathclaw hides, while they are in the game, they are random drops and random looted items.
---
Nah.  I think she will become the guide in a future major DLC, like she is in current game.  Leaving holotapes as breadcrumbs.
---
I think I experienced why we don’t have fast travel mats last night. 
---
I fast traveled to a camp and ended up in the foundations. It was up atop Seneca rocks and so I traveled to the Seneca marker and tried to climb but gave up and decided I’d try to travel back to the camp and make a run for it before the objects load in. But this time the objects were already loaded, and I didn’t spawn in the foundation, I was ON the foundation. 
---
So that got me thinking— if someone puts a fast travel mat on top of a structure/floor/foundation, if you zone in before the objects load, you’d be stuck in the structure. 
---
Though maybe they could solve this with a few more seconds of load time, and pulling in player structures before spawning you in the world. But since that’s been an issue for a while, I kinda bet they pulled the travel mats while they work on this. 
---
Sorry for the long-winded reply.
---
Well most those factions do have roughly another 200 years on us, give or take. So that means we have 200 years to fix all of Appalachias problems and form a functional government then I’d say we’re set :D
---
It’s funny you say that, my GT is WhiteyTighteyMan and I’ve just gotten to level 50 without ever wearing a piece of clothing!
---
Killed about 30 of them not a single drop
---
This is an ongoing issue since launch. I had 3 charisma and maxed Magnetic with a full team which in theory gave me 9 charisma. I could share 3 point perk card but the moment I closed my pip-boy it stopped sharing. I even found a piece of armor with +1 CHR and at 10 it did the same thing. Without magnetic I had 4 charisma and still could not share a 1 point card after closing my pip boy.
---
I now have 1 CHR and gave up on sharing anything.
---
I think.....that they' think........."you know what................lets just not go there"
---
Now I want to see a kangaroo base :(
---
Yep thanks
---
Ugh! Is there any of them that will actually work?
---
This is awesome. I have a question
---
It seems that the higher the first per shot damage that the actual damage starts to decrease later in the table (higher enemy dr). As if you have more armour penetration. Why is this?
---
Yeah! Who the fuck taught those bugs to use a doorknob.
---
Theres a bunker that has I o u notes, one for beer and toilet paper at least
---
&gt; What if other survivors from the capital wasteland, Chicago, the Boston Commonwealth or even from the far West came to Appalachia? What would they see?
---
Mushroom clouds
---
We the players of 76 are the strongest faction. We have nukes and they don't. 
---
I imagine it would take a little adhesive, steel and oil to increase our nuke range to the west coast and finish off those upstarts in the Mojave.
---
sleepy4792, on Xbox
---
I think they are doing what they need to so that they can salvage the complete disaster that was this game's launch. Nothing really impressive, just necessary.
---
have you considered we become the enclave? It would explain the weird outfits, the epic weapons, and the desire to kill everyone. 
---
Or maybe we nuke ourselves out and in the future there's no remnants of vault 76.
---
(not OP)
---
That might be...problematic, as the interior spaces in instanced areas won't likely map the same way out-world ones do, due to them having (probably) different coordinate 'systems'.
---
That and, one of the reasons I was looking for this was because sometimes the closest bench is inside 'something', but getting from the entrance to wherever inside the bench is can be more of a slog than just walking to the next exterior bench (I'm looking at you Ft. Defiance *shakes fist*)
---
Yes I have or have had 2 two shot fat man’s, 1 instigating, 1 hunter’s.
---
Two shot is the way to go btw. Double damage :) 
---
Also MIRV does same damage no matter the level. I have a level 25 that showed the same damage as a level 45 daisy cutter
---
PSN Leshfei
---
Seeing as how I paid about $45 for it and have played about 800hrs now, I’d say it’s been more than worth $0.05 per hour! You’ll just have to jump in, form your own opinion, and continue playing if you like it. If not, you’re not out too much money, it’s regularly $15 on amazon

Yes some guy said he found them on gulpers and in random boxes. I have yet to see one but like you have been farming the animal they are associated with without luck.
---
For people like us...i think we need capes. Id love to just forest gump the map in tighties and a cape
---
no problem!
---
Lol sorry could have phrased it better but your post made me doubt myself :)
---
Troy and Abed in the mooooorning!
---
I agree and I play on xbox
---
Mix of heavy metal and heavy leather should be best. Combat armor's a lot easier to find though, because you get pieces reliably from Scorched Earth.
---
And now it's where you go to scrap them, there's an odd symmetry to it that's pleasing to the soul
---
I don’t think Bethesda knows how to do math. I doubt any of them have ever actually fired a gun either, except maybe paintball.
---
True, but given that in 6 months we’ve become cap hoarding fiends, launched countless nukes and systematically continued the war we were meant to prevent again....looking real bright! :)
---
I can't wait for mutant's leather left leg 😎
---
They're less likely to shoot you and steal your stuff in the street
---
Whitespring golf course has a lot of those little white snack shacks you can build in. But they’re tiny
---
I run a glass cannon bloodied build. I can do 1300+ damage with a powerfist, but i can get mulched by ranged weapons.

*need to push big red button intensifies*
---
So Antifa got you to jump off a cliff...that's happening in the real world too amazing!
---
Sorry I didn't realize I was still on your wall when I scroll down and seeing the next post I thought it would help the person. Lol but seeing as it's your post I'm sure you had that info long time ago
---
Maybe with junk placement you can stock it but I suspect with junk it will be empties only.
---
Rip ive been trying railroad photographer archaeologist electrician and atomics fan since I found out some of the others don’t work
---
I have a little bit of an issue with spawning at my camp because I built on a cliff wall with a ledge. I’ve move my CAMP around but the game keeps spawning me in random places so I’m having a hard time narrowing it down. Wish we had fast travel mats.
---
'Many studios' it's okay OP you can say BioWare
---
Except without the ability to trade item-for-item, there's no safe in-game method to trade an OP legendary rifle for an OP legendary shotgun. The cap economy is still broken.
---
Hell no. I need those constant radstag spawns for that sweet, sweet carry weight.
---
ok thanks for replying anyway!
---
I love dog food!
---
Lol, i was one of first person who had recipe for chameleon mutation, i sold 10 of them 1k each just to one guy.
---
Guy who had first speed demon recipe could have now infinite amound of caps.
---
400k is not so hard to get plaing legit, when you have knowlege about game you are playing.
---
Level 45 is the same as level 50; they're both max levels for different items
---
We don’t talk about those times
---
How do you propose that OP proves he's "playing legit?"
---
Would the true Enclave really accept us though? Would you want a functioning military and government with someone who can bunny hop up to a roof next to you?
---
Cry about it, no. Call people out for this shitty new practice that every company seems to be doing? Yes.
---

Either you forgot the /s or you’re actually an idiot.

I got one too after killing Scorched at a workshop I claimed.

Tell 'em to fix the urban scout armor left arm while you're at it.  :)
---
On second thoughts, don't -- they'll probably break the forest scout armor left arm to match it!
---
We at Pulowski respectfully disagree with your opinion of our product. Maybe you didn't follow our patent pending Pulowski Product Personal Protection Pamphlet? And we never claimed to protect you from gaint Jersey Devils. We are sorry for your loss however.
---
There is no spawns anymore other than low level shit anymore.Only thing u can do is that shitty scout bullshit
---
Speaking as general of the enclave, yes, i would accept myself.
---
I dont know about the rest of you mutated monsters, but I'll take me.
---
And How exactly would someone prove that?
---
To enforce how easy it is to make Caps in this game, Ponder this, I have a character dedicated to selling Plans, Recipes, and magazines, I added 4 Vending machines to the Camp Tuesday Night, Priced most Plans at around 50% of list price, and sold more than 30k in less than an hour, I had to shut down because I couldn't move caps quick enough.
---
Do they complete the challenge?
---
All the more reason we need player driven factions. We need some dedicated souls to restore peace and order for a safe and secure society.
---
This day extracts a heavy toll.
---
i screwed up... big time xDDD
---
so, i spend all the points to reassign perk balance... all nice and good...
---
then turns out i am missing half the perks i needed, lol.
---
now i have to level up 20ish times to get all i am missing
---
There is a perk in charisma for better prices and you can use Grape mentats to lower prices further. Other than that, you may find a kind person selling a dupe for cheap.
---
Rarely any actual scorchbeasts in Watoga itself, just all the robots.
---
Is it possible to make of map of areas you can or can't build in? Something like a red zone where you can't place your camp.
---
Umm, kill me if you must, but no. Not really.
---
A) They promised a year of free updates following release, so they couldn't very well renege on it without potentially getting into hot water for false advertising.
---
B) Most of the stuff being added should have been in at release anyway, such as the upcoming Purveyor.
---
C) Relatively speaking, the number of additions pales in comparison to competition. If you compare what Bethesda did and what other game developers did, it's not particularly impressive, considering the quality (the amount of bugs).
---
D) And while \*some\* studios might have cut their losses, a surprising amount (that aren't EA, cough Andromeda cough) do not. Most recent and amazing example being No Man's Sky - 3 years and counting, including very sizeable updates, basically a new VR version of the game coming in a few months, all of it completely free, and features that haven't even been hinted on at launch - such as ground vehicles, submarines, etc.
---
Finally, Bethesda isn't doing it out of altruism. The game has a cash store, and is multiplayer. They need the people to keep yanking them by the teats to get the milk. Whereas other companies, again looking at No Man's Sky here, have ZERO microtransactions (afaik?). Meaning they did all this for their players, without the ulterior motive of intending to milk them with MTX.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's nice and all, but it's not unusual, and relatively speaking not particularly impressive in scope so far.
---
Yeah, head on down to whitesprings with your golf outfit and tiki torch instead, untold numbers of idiots will follow.

 Most of all the duplicated items were removed from people's inventory. It seems unlikely there are too many people sitting on stacks of those duplicated items. While there may be still many duplicated items in the economy they are about to be washed away in the huge influx of available 3 star legendaries for sale when the Purveyor arrives and people start selling the crap they don't want from her random drops.
---
What about kazooies
---
17 other characters! **wa-wa-wee-wah!**

I will give that a try tonight, thanks for the heads up guys. I knew there had to be more than one way to get the badges.
---
We won't end up getting a patch before the 21st. Yes these all have legendary attach points. Syringer and drill do not which is why they never dropped as legendary

Equipping and unequipping pocketed armor over and over until the carry weight was in the negative... those were the days...
---
This is really cool.
---
I know you don't want to open the source yet but I was wondering if I could look at the 2.7MB file. I was thinking it would be fairly easy to have a web user select the items they want on a map then have some code generate the image on demand and cache it. If you don't already have a plan for that, I could try and write some code tonight.
---
Lmao. What's wrong with it?
---
Safe?  Safe?  You venture out into the wasteland hoping to be safe?
---
When your game has gone full Venezuela, that people are just trowing money away as it doesn't have any real value.

Oh, good !  It's been a full 5 minutes since the last " how's the game" popped up. I was getting worried over here
---
set up your camp right by the civil war graveyard. sell shovels.
---
It's use based, but condition only degrades when you deal damage with the weapon. So shooting and missing, or swinging your sword at a tree, won't reduce the condition. Different items degrade at different rates, and effects like Two-Shot have an impact too. Bashing with your firearm degrades it faster than just shooting something; I don't know if it works the same with melee and power attacks. 
---
For armor it degrades when you take damage but I'm not sure on the specifics.
---
I just found a "Broken Prosnap Deluxe Camera" in a toolbox at Sunnytop Ski Lanes while doing the athletic course, and crafted another.

Full endurance makes fighting scorched beasts/deathclaws way more possible. Try to get a autostim piece(if you can spare stimpacks) and weight reduction gear (for picking up everything you need to repair) and the best power armor is ultracite unless you have the option to mod xo1 with calibrated shocks targeting optimized bracers and a jetpack/medic pump, 
---
I have a strength/endurance build so I use a 2-3*super sledge /grognak axe
---
Guy was asking this one hour ago, can you guys use fucking seach button?
---
I think anything you do in the game completes the challenges. It's not specific unless listed in the challenge you are trying to complete.
---
YEAH FUCK THE BAG
---
*Thunderous Applause*
---
Gotta say I agree with Cipher here. I thoroughly enjoy the game, but with what I'm used to expecting with new games and MMOs this just falls short.
---
The real make or break for me will be when they release the Vault "raid", if that's good great, if not I may just play it once in a while. But regardless I maintain the belief that they should have released with everything in the game as it is now AND a vault raid. It's only since the most recent patch where I've been like "I have nothing to do" and by that meant nothing I feel like doing right now e.g. scout quests.
---
I say all this because I love the series, I want it to be great. But I did accept the game as it was at launch which I realise is part of the problem. Part of the reason that this game is in the state it is now is its bad reception.
---
If we hold developers (not just Bethesda) accountable for the shit they throw in front of us, then they might just make a better game next time.
---
Edit: Again I don't mean FO76 is shit, but the amount of problems and content from it at launch for the price that was charged isn't acceptable, and we shouldn't accept it.
---

I think he's also referring to the Fisher sites as they have scat around them but on the roofs of several buildings you can find scorchbeast Ness in watauga. I checked and you can get some of the supplies there but my post was guaranteed spawn locations to make the quest really easy just have to fast travel between them

I think all three words related to this one, it is by the Relay Tower, that is next to a fork in the river. From here he is, as he simply says, heading north.

Well geez man. I left for navy and finally have an opportunity to check the game out again. All i asked was a question.

Now you’ve got me wishing we could hook up objects for when people purchase something. Strobe light, sirens, flame jets (away from where they could hurt people). Just for some purchase fanfare.

For fuck's sake.

I've got several of the challenge areas that are not registering. They are already discovered (I have a blue icon on the map that I can fast travel to) but they don't show as being "discovered" for the challenge in the list.

In the Mire it's Treehouse Village and Valley Galleria, Toxic Valley fails to register Grafton Dam.

If he has 17 characters and goes around and gets max caps on each one of them daily, he’d be making 23,800k Caps a day...then selling things on the side, he’s easily have 400k Caps in less than a month. And do it completely legit. Even if he only took a couple or few of his characters and got the max caps everyday &amp; sold stuff on the side, he’s d have the 400k in 2-4 months. It’s a matter of being diligent and saving the caps. I usually hover around 10k because I like to buy things...and help my teammates out. And I’ll even buy things for lower levels if I can’t craft it just to help them out. Aside from that...400k caps is easily achievable if you’re willing to grind.
---
Certainly for weapons bashing enemies with it causes it to decrease, the weapon type itself can have an effect as well as I believe, explosive weapons tend to break faster. Mods can increase or decrease a weapons durability and plus any perk cards in active use that slow down weapon damage.
---
Armour works in a similar way with perk cards but I can guess that if a piece of armour is strong against a certain damage type but weaker with others, if you sustained continual damage the armour wasn't good at absorbing, then it would break down faster.
---
This is a great game, it's the first game that's made me stop playing fifa totally, And I needed that.

There's so much to do now and I don't have time to do it all, I'll never get bored on this game.

Abandoned bog town?
---
\&gt;&gt; 130% of condition but can't craft the crossbow without the card equipped. 
---
You need Gunsmith 2, to craft it, the "over condition" is soley down to Intelligence as to how FAR over conditioned it is. (Int 15 is about 160-175%, Int 17 About 185% )
---
Shots fired will reduce it's condition (De-equip Gunsmith), Bash attacks reduce it quicker.
---
Fuck em even harder then. If it's not clearly illegal now it's going to be.
---
All of your 'free DLC' were features cut from the game that they are now patching in. Hook, line and sinker. Company's are getting really good at framing it to feel like the customer is winning, people are falling for it a lot more.
---
tararynieyn - PC Selling recipes,plans,meds,ammo, nuke cards.
---
Legendary effects on weapons seem to be a factor as well. As several of my furious weapons break faster than the same weapon with different effects.
---
Don't forget Fix it Good and Weapon Artisan to over-repair equipment to 200%. That plus the slower degradation perks means you can make your gear last around four times as long.
---
Tinfoil suit and miners cap?
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
Yes. Because even if you don't use it, you have nothing to do with money. So it is smart liquidize the money. 100k in items is still more than 25k in caps. If you later need money, you can easily sell them.
---
Ahh yes thank you
---
Give us Legendary Power Armor please :D
---
Power armour stops this from being a problem. If you ever need to avoid it
---
its not about real guns at all.
---
they simply missed to fix a value. again.
---
it took half a year to fix the problem where the .50 was weaker than the .308, even though it was reported pretty much in the first week.
---
maybe in another 6 months they actually fix it. maybe then energy weapons are also finally a valid choice.
---
More then Anthem and Anthem's dead soon apparently.
---
Rads aren’t exactly difficult to collect, i understand it if you have mutations you are trying to protect and don’t keep starched genes equipped.  But really if you get a rad bath it only takes a minute more in a water source to reverse the effects.

With that being said mine is actually situated on an area that can be bypassed if a player decides to not run through it.

---
Maybe it's the reverse. Maybe nuclear winter is COMING- after all, it's October when we leave the Vault- and whoever this is either came from somewhere where the winter has already hit, or possibly knows how devastating it will be, and we have to actually get ATLAS working in order to prevent this new ice age from killing us all and destroying Appalachia.

We might end up getting some in the future and if we do I'll make sure to let people know as soon as I find it

"will you comply?"
---
Your version of communism is completely theoretical though, real world implementation matters, and in the real world communist governments have a horrible track record. Your best case communist examples would be on the small scale with people like the Amish, but they are also bonded by a common purpose and belief system. It just doesn't work with a large diverse population. Without private property, all property must be centrally controlled by the state and the state has to use force against anyone who disagrees, communism requires authoritarianism to work, otherwise what if I disagree and decide I'm going to opt out of your collective? Citizens have never been in control of the state the way you describe, there is always an oligarchic class making the decisions. The revolutionaries become the new tyrants.
---
Both Fascism and Communism have horrible real world historic records for executions of dissidents, imprisoning, mass starvation of populations etc. And the communist governments have killed more people in the last 100 years than any other.
---
thank you very much!

Yea it looks like some normally dropping legendary weapons aren't on here. I'm going to submit a ticket/response form to let them know about the issues and hopefully they add some stuff

It's still Windows 10 core. MS does embedded windows for ATM's and other industrial applications, but at their heart they are still the Windows kernel. Per Wikipedia:

no problem

So like every game nowadays? Cool.

Nah, I have given plenty of criticism. The difference between you and me is that you are only capable of criticizing. I'm capable of both.

From my understanding the burrows doesn't respawn. Idk how true it is, but I know whitesprings is reliable.

Jenkyfatblobcat on ps4, mostly plans, some ammo
---
&gt;I know Bethesda have worked hard to introduce new stuff to the game and it has brought me back but it’s not a selfless gesture purely for the fans.
---
That's pretty much true of every gaming company though. They're businesses, and their first order of business is to make money. Free content, updates, and patches all tie into money. The time you start to worry is when those patches and updates start getting smaller over time, or the space between them gets greater and greater.
---
That said, I do hope Bethesda re-launches 76 later down the line when it's vastly improved.
---
*Still waiting...*

1. Thank you so much for this.
---
2. Lol at the Pumpkin House on the rare flora map.
---
I simply give credit where credit is due. There are actual human beings working hard to release update after update. My words are for them.
---
I'm sure that you don't work hard in your daily job out of altruism either - but still you like your boss/customers congratulating you.
---
C ur s e d.
---
Anyone selling faschnat recipes please post!  Still missing 2!
---
Definately not impossible..i chose a different path. Rather than having max caps on all thos differebt characters..i would get to max caps..and buy a gun or armor piece. Move that to a mule. Id i imagine one mule has about 300k worth of guns and armor. I set up a trading hub and had people coming thru all the time buying and selling. I mean i bought a be sniper for 600 caps abd sold it for 12k. Its one of the rarer flips but they happen.
---
Watoga and harpers ferry vendors should have them (corresponding bots at Whitesprings as well)
---
I love the Internet.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I only tried to buy once from a guy and i got an error saying that trading failed on that server. I think i will wait until they fix it for good before i start spending big caps. Meanwhile, i do challenges and collect caps for that day
---
*spoiler* she's most likely still alive because the overseer quest never ends and she leaves you a holotape after you launch a nuke which takes place AFTER her run in with the mole miners.
---
Just play the damn game yourself and decide for yourself. No need to make a post about it, because how one person feels about the game can be a completely different experience for someone else.
---
Hol up and pump the breaks, there's forest armor?
---
I built my camp fully knowing that people will spawn in at the exact point where I originally place my camp machine. So, they arrive nicely in front of my front door, seeing my garden, my garage and my market machine, able to walk directly into my pub if they instead wishes. Also, the purified water in the purifiers is free.
---
All it takes is some planning.
---
Wow triggered much lol.
---
The brotherhood would find this power disturbing. 
---
The enclave are proud. 
---
I am honored.
---
Thanks. I’ll send a request. :)
---
EPIC.
---
You can’t trade or drop cameras. It automatically destroys them
---
Happened to me last week for two hours , I had to unplug my router to finally get it to work
---
Done
---
I gave them £49.99 worth of credit!
---
Tea pot has almost all bugs and wolfs for bug parts pictures and kills
---
The game has always been fun and worth playing, just don't expect perfection and you'll have an absolute blast. 
---
P.S. Don't rush, there's no hurry. I think so much of the negativity comes from people speed dialling through to end game and levels in the hundreds then complaining there is lack of content, it's and exploration game, treat it like that and the wastes will pull you in to immersion.
---
And thank's for your service now and in the future ;)
---
Too easy to get exactly what you want at that point. This already makes it much easier to finish your build than it has been, it's a form of gambling enjoy it for that or don't, highly doubt they'll change it.
---
how do you fill them?
---
PS4, PSN: Chlebostrom. My camp says it have 205plans for sale.
---
This x200
---
Higher enemy DR results in less effective damage.
---
Ah good point.
---
That's a great point! If they don't fix the load order, a fast travel mat wouldn't help unless the camp owner put the mat away from all structures. Hopefully they do that because I don't want to move my camp but I have 0 map points for people to travel to in order to get to my camp.
---
I love the seach button, always makes be hard...
---
It's a business after all. Thing is, other companies just leave their games a disaster and that's it.
---
I saw some at the R&amp;G Train Station earlier today.
---
sometimes when you are scraping junk that doesn't normally scrap like beer bottles it shows your armor for a split second and if your spamming the button you will scrap the first item in the list for armor i lost a wedding ring because i had my inventory sorted by value and it was the top of the list
---
They're really as high-res as imgur allows :( I mean 4k*4k is pretty high res right? I wonder if users on mobile are not getting the full quality inage?
---
I just want to know what’s new, Bethesda released a big roadmap right before i left and i still had a lot of the game left to go when i had to leave. I’ve always thought the game was fun i just wanted to know if it’s gotten better
---
&gt;  Including accessibility options like Text-to-Speech, and Speech-To-Text
---
You're going to see a lot more of that going forward.  [Due to legal reasons](https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/video-games-cvaa-accessibility-law-1203099440/) all new games must conform to certain accessibility requirements.
---
The people who say that Bethesda has lost reputation will buy TES VI in bulk.
---
I liked it before i left. Still have some more of the story to go, right before i left there was a roadmap released that had some cool updates planned
---
Is 40 as high as rippers go? I hope it’s like destiny where every once in a while the “light” level goes up
---
Go check out anthem and Mass effect Andromeda from BioWare. And we can complain about the shape it came out in sure. It wasn’t good. It’s much better now. I’ll take it.
---
If they walked away no one would have ever trusted another Fallout game from them.
---
That's your choice.
---
I have accepted how the world works.
---
To my knowledge you will not find or be able to use those broken cameras unless you already found the tourist. Those cameras are to replace one if you lost yours.
---
Then. Play. It. Yourself.
---
You said it yourself, they released a roadmap. Read the roadmap and the update notes that they post every damn week. And no, it’s the same damn people who play this game now as it was when you left. Some people hate the new updates, some love it.
---
True.
---
Might be something with mobile, thank you
---
I'm curious, because they look decent to me. Are they worse than [this](https://i.imgur.com/Wmjy34S.png)? (bearing in mind that's a screenshot which is now twice-compressed)
---
Ffreal, I can’t even fathom what I dropped that in hindsight I shouldn’t have… spilt milk I suppose.
---
I don’t get it, why feel bad when he takes stuff from supply drop? 🤔
---
At least you can get in. I just fired up the game for the first time since sekiro came out and I got disconnected before my camp even fully loaded in. Good to see they're finally sorting out the stability /s
---
GOOD LUCK GETTING THIS PERSONAL MATTER RESOLVED
---
hey from the future. You was right
---
I'm on pc and having the same issues with this statue :(
---
I guess I'm a generous person. I like to give credit with my words, not only with my money.
---
No, go away
---
I figured at some point down the line. It’s not like the regular plasma is unusable or anything, I just don’t like to see inconsistencies get shored up. Them adding the scout armors was a step in that direction at least.
---
&gt;Interiors cells (inside buildings) are not mapped
---
There is an entry in the note about that.
---
Yup! Here's the full list!
---
How do you know it was after?
---
Hadn't even considered this implication of player vending: by proactively making your camp visible on the map to others (by virtue of vending), you implicitly indicate that you're likely to be a willing interactor, *and* you draw people to any (CAMPable) location - so if you find something cool, now you can easily share it with others.
---
RP intensifies...
---
Not yet. It'll be 8 or so hours before I can try it but I did notice the kill the cryptid was marked as completed and I rarely get on survival.
---
Right? I grew up playing old-school RPGs and Grognak is pretty well done so I get...distracted when I pick it up lol
---
I know, i was just laughing at *socialist* capitalism. 
---
Its an oxymoron like anarcho-capitalism, or dry water.
---
Even if the sold for 25k, it would be still cheap. Even if you have 100k, it's irrelevant. The money is irrelevant, because you are yet again gated behind heavy RnG.
---
Gone straight in my “saved posts of huge use when playing FO76” pile. Stunning work.
---
I'm really loving my random Sheepsquatch encounters, haven't got into this whole Scout thing yet, something for later.
---
Yeah I tried that but it didn’t work. I’ll try again just for the hell of it. I’m thinking my character got stuck it glitched when I Server hopped and my main character is stuck unless Beth can fix it.
---
If only I could get a few World Series results now 😂
---
Ugh that sucks. Did it happen once or every time?
---
Using Ammosmith (2), you get a little over 80 rounds each time you craft it.  And the flux you need is in plentiful supply whenever Whitesprings gets nuked.
---
I believe its twin lakes that spawn a pack of wolves as well.
---
I was able to trade mine.
---
I've searched out the person on the map if they have a legendary item that I'm interested in and asked them to come back to their camp. Everyone has been willing to do so and i ended up buying a few of those items.
---
I kept forgetting these bug parts are scrap-able since I never collect them any other time. I had to trek all over the Mire 3 fu*king times before I finally fished this quest! So dumb...
---
Wasting points on gunfu. Remove two and put in adrenaline. I would also lower your endurance, If your not pvping ditch adamantine skeleton. 4 rad resist? Total waste imo.
---
I wasn’t. It gave me a warning that the camera would be destroyed if I dropped it and my friend couldn’t find it in my trade
---
Or they can't.
---
Mute, Deaf, speech problems, or just unable to be talking out loud while they play.
---
I posted this suggestion a couple months back. 
---
Now, with players able to build 4 machines, holding 30 items each, raising the cap limit is absolutely ESSENTIAL. 
---
I have 4 machines running, and by my own stubbornness and the fact that I’m old and out of touch, I refuse to have more than one character (I.e. “mules”) And because all I pretty much do is farm (and I actually do enjoy it) I always have an over abundance of 3*** Legendaries, tons of bulk everything and flux, etc. 
---
I’m at Cap limit so often I went and bought some serum recipes on the fly from the WS bunker just so my customers wouldn’t get my stuff for free! Lol. 
---
But it’s all good. I’m sure Bethesda will raise it up eventually. I would think doubling it to 50k would be a great start.
---
Edited to add: Currently Level 277 and I play on XB1.
---
Oh and I have found a couple of sweet melee weapons I've not had drop in my 180 levels, so the player vendors are are great addition to the game in my opinion.
---
Great idea! When trading, I’ve sold a small amount for 1 cap each, and then given more for free. You can’t do that in the machines. People will just take all the free ammo.
---
I can do you one better and just hit you up with a custom map of just Tarberries - that's the whole beauty of this tool.
---
https://i.imgur.com/HDV9zY2.jpg
---
Totally the purveyor should massively boost supply of wanted weapons like 3* plasma rifles vs taking pure RNG and getting another 3* board
---
Do you have a github for it? I know quite a bit about distributed computing so maybe we can hike it up on an HDFS system like Hadoop and run it on Spark if it isn’t already - that should give you the ability to run all your code in minutes compared to hours (if not less!)
---
After burrows was release, people told it was garbage. Then reddit people defended it to be better Whitespring- "so many legendaries, so much loot, so worth doing, so much better than whitespring"
---
It seems to be if I dont get d/c before everything loads in then I should be ok. Have to stand perfectly still as well. Disconnecting is the reason I stopped playing so I hope itll be a bit better tonight
---
I am the LLLLLLAW
---
Sheepsquatch you say? That definitely wasn’t around when i left. Is it exactly what it sounds like?
---
I started with 10k caps. Broke from buying from people's vending machine. So much better and easier than in person trades.
---
Yeah I'll be waiting on a guide showing how to do 25k a day. Not to mention do it 17 times in less than 24 hours
---
Have you recently suffered a head injury? What the fuck are you talking about?
---
But is that where we are at now? Giving companies praise for releasing a buggy game but then not giving up on it seems like a low bar.
---
Give the guy a break... LOL
---
Ironically the user WanderOften doesn't want to wander too much and take his time
---
Im hoping for missle based fireworks
---
Oh are there Official vendors you can place in your base now? I remember a lot of people really wanting a vendor system to sell items when i left
---
I think there's a reason we don't have moving platforms yet, it's a bit buggy if you look at the catapults people make so they may want to fix it before adding moving platforms.
---
Dont move while aiming.
---
Yeah, but that would be the gassed season. We don't talk about the gas leak season.
---
They are part of the antique light plans... you can get them at whitsprings
---
I love the game.
---
*(screams in mole miner)*
---
Haha me too, gonna pay for borrowing.
---
use letters and make your own sign.
---
Yesterday I did a single loop, 3 3 stars and over a dozen no star or untagged.  I think I was on one of those “lucky” servers I’ve read so much about
---
There was also a well stocked vendor on the course that had a lot of traffic.  Perhaps that traffic was boosting the stars/rate.
---
Yea lmaooo, the hunt begins
---
I get that but if i increase the shot damage the damage fallof begins later in the table.
---
Example assuming penetration stays the same. Im giving arbritrary numbers.
---
200 per shot damage damage stays 200 untill 60 enemy dr. Then it starts to drop.
---
I increase the damage to 400 the damage starts falling off at 120 dr.
---
Or a proper example. Compare 2 lv50 hunting rifles. All stock, one has 30% weapon specific, the other 60%.
---
First rifle damage starts to drop at 15 dr. Second at 20dr.
---
Good point. Bye!
---
 Welcome to the Roughnecks!
---
And that's the point where the playerbase seems to split. One half expected the game to be fully polished on release and is now disappointed because that's not the case. The other half doesn't mind that the game is a work in progress and that Bethesda is changing and updating things.
---
Well, you gotta realize one thing: the game was meant to be an MVP (minimal viable product) from the very beginning. It was SUPPOSED to be like that. Bethesda is currently *not* putting out dumpster fires, they're not doing damage control, they're not struggling to keep afloat and they're not going out of their way to polish up their image. Because it's all part of the plan &lt;read this in Heath Ledger's Joker voice&gt;.
---
76 was supposed to have only the bare minimum of features to satisfy early adopters. Then, steadily and slowly, new content would be implemented to keep people hooked and to improve the game over time, drawing in more players. Before, during and after launch, Bethesda has been repeating their intention on many occasions: they wanted to try something new, they're eagerly looking forward to player feedback, they will add new free stuff over time and fix issuey, they have a bigger plan for the future, they want to support it "forever", etc.
---
In and of itself, that's not a bad thing. In fact, that's common practice in lots of startups, often lacking the money and willingness to take risks to fully develop their product first and find customers afterwards.
---
BUT: in my opinion, even for MVP-standards, Bethesda is doing a rather poor job... sorry. And in the process they're alienating a significant amount of long-term fans of the franchise. Many decisions to add certain features (or to deliberately not add them) and the myriad of recurring bugs and blunders make it *look* like they have no idea what the hell they're doing. That's most likely not the case... but I can only evaluate what I actually see and experience - and what I DO see and experience, well, it just *feels* lazy and thoughtless.
---
I had to scrap the foundation it was on and then it went away.
---
Just ignore the salty kids, asking a question is not the end of the world. People seem to be unable to just ignore things they have no interest in and walk away.
---
Always this constant state of outrage SMH
---
Tested it. Sometimes it works while moving, sometimes it doesn't.
---
If you’re not going to look fabulous, you may as well curl up in a ball and die.
---
Or dress up in robot armor and RP an Assaultrons...
---
Do you want a junkies with 90% weight reduction (now only weigh 8 lbs)?
---
I do about the same. I play melee only really, with some Tesla just for tagging legendarys for events.
---
All ammo is 1c. 
---
All grenades are 1c as well as I have an instigating  weapon so they become useless to me.
---
Wow, haven't seen a hot take like this one before
---
Or both?
---
Pictures seem pretty dark. Please enhance
---
Ok
---
Sorry for our loss.
---
Hit up nukes and dragon and plan out a build. The roadmap feature on the bottom of the page will help with what perks and specials to add.
---
You mad bro?
---
I will say it's a really fun game and I have quite enjoyed my time with it! Once y get over lvl 50 it becomes a lot more fun!!
---
Hi! I'm the guy living in the van.
---
No it’s just idiotic people are this lazy
---
I can share that, but the thing is my smaller file is not complete. For example just today I added workbenches and pre-war food. So if you did build a tool, you'd be reliant on me sending you data whenever something changes - which is kinda an ugly solution.
---
I have strayed away from the web-app solution because I have to host it, it's usually not mobile friendly, and it's slow. With these images people can literally download and keep them. Furthermore, a big part of getting this working was actually 'calibrating' the map data with the underlying map, if that makes sense? Since we have no anchor points I had to arbitrarily adjust the origin and scaling of the data points until they fit perfectly on the image.
---
Bye! One less complainer!
---
How do you look at these maps at imgur without them being so pixelated? Interested in the junk map, thanks :)
---
Sooo.... every weapon and armor?
---
Will be even better when they fix the inspect bug when the owner is not around looking at 2-3* legendaries.  Although I was able to tell sometimes from the heading what the 2nd start might be.
---
Holy shit that's next level awesome
---
Really fun animation, it's always fighting super mutants when I've found one, has a great regen so be prepared for a good fight.
---
I'm honestly proud of them. I might come back when I have more free time because even when it was buggy I enjoyed it.
---
Until recently, you could make caps trivially easily by spending a few long afternoons farming civil war hat plans  and just dumping a boatload of cloth on the mules to make hats to sell straight to vendors. Once you had the fast travel points opened, it didn't take much to do a tour and clear vendors out for caps each day. I know, because I did it on my 4 toons when I was buying all the vendor plans.
---
Now if only they had a grouping system...
---
I'm afraid that's not something I know to be extractable. It may be hard-coded coordinates in the game which we can't get to by opening up the resource files.
---
Thanks. Edited.
---
I think it had to do with people putting vintage nukashine in there and basically trolling anyone who tried to drink from it
---
I mean its a 60 $ games WITH micro transaction. It is suppose to be bug free at the release.
---
Dont get me wrong, it is a good thing that they are fixing it. But it is what they SUPPOSE to do. It is their apologies, we dont need to thank them for it.
---
so, nuke-zones are not a thing anymore?
---
and why on earth would i ditch adamantite skeleton in pve? ever heard of grenades and missile launchers?
---
and gun-fu is not about auto switching targets. it gives 30% extra damage on consecutive targets.
---
I'm very happy with the direction this is heading. It's actually reducing cap price inflation because of easy supply mechanisms,  and at the same time removing caps from the economy and increasing the net value of a cap.
---
Not me. 2 accounts, 7 characters capped with 3 others at somewhere between 3-10K each. I'm just shy of 200K caps. And I have nothing to spend it on because you can't buy good weapons and armor for caps, even if you offer 125K (5 full characters) worth.
---
Make serums, level up your alts to have some charisma and Hard Bargain. Transfer serums to them via a friend or by using 2 accounts. Max out your caps daily on every character.
---
Excellent
---
This is incredible work but I’ve gotta critique the border animations. They’re a completely different style than the main images, which are REALLY well done. Takes the eye off of the detailed write up and main sketch
---
I built mine off the edge of a cliff.  Couldn't find out why no one was coming to my vending machine until I fast traveled to my own camp.
---
I spawned somewhere in mid air, while it was still loading I heard my guy hit the ground, loading in with a broken leg.  
---
Probably not good for business.
---

---
You can plan out your build there, and see all of the perks. My advice is to first look for the perks in each SPECIAL you would want equipped all the time, like Starched Genes or Lone Wanderer. That'll get you an idea of the minimum SPECIAL you'd want in each stat, and then leftover points can be put where you need them for perks you'd want to swap around a lot.
---
It's not hard at all to legendary farm. I do it at the same time as doing my plastic/lead/steel runs.. go to the golf course and do ALL of whitespring. KILL EVERYTHING there is from the hotel almost down to the snake on the map 🐍 and around the houses then go do a burrows run.
---
It went great. We ended up playing Nuka Tapper and the previous Top Tapper was dethroned by over 12k points!
---
We do these every Thursday :)
---
I have an extra. Cant drop it or sell it though. I haven't tried trading. Ps4 sn Mantrayne if you wanna try later. I'm at work right now. 😕
---
Also a behemoth
---
&gt; I'm also sick of them rolling two SB's deep, doing wasteland drive-by's and leveling my freaking camp.  
---
drive by's? I think you mean A-10 strafing runs
---
looking for a revive + water revive can we do one together?
---
Pipe revolvers are the best weapon in the game.
---
I want bunting and sparklers.
---
&gt; We won't end up getting a patch before the 21st. 
---
I'm curious as to why you say that, given that Bethesda has said that they're [moving up their deployment of the Purveyor from the 23rd to the 16th](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5v7FIGaz3bakvwrXsOZerZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-the-purveyor)...
---
Can I have your caps?
---
I just want the other cool items in the game. Like the other rare clothing items and other plans/what not
---
I really hope it does scale. I saw a video a while back and it said somthing like you have a 1 in 33000 chance to get the legendary you want and I get it's meant to be a hard grind but what bugs me more is I've had about 6 items what seem amazing but they wasnt max lvl so it makes them almost useless to me at least. so if I'm getting 3 star lvl 30 junk I'm gonna be pissed and it almost make it pointless I guess you lower the odds because you can pick how many stars and what type of weapon but still finding that one thing you have always wanted then realizing its lvl 20  or somthing.
---
Server-wide event to power up Liberty Prime.
---
Unless they reject the quest.  Then they're free to pvp.
---
I'm thinking Ronald Reagan did stop nuclear inhalation. I lived through it. Hope you did too.
---
This happened to me as well. Lost all my pictures from the beta when the game came out and just recently lost them all again.
---
https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/536977-fallout-76-order-of-the-tadpole-all-exam-answers
---
Not sure if they're all correct however
---
Seems inconsistent.
---
Ahhh my bad I didn’t kno that. But could I find one and fix it and give it to u?
---
The Reddit’s made for discussion. Just because you aren’t interested in it doesn’t mean you have to be a complete dick about it. You could’ve just left a downvote and went on your way.
---
My camp my look minimalist (2x2 with every crafting bench and a bed, then lots of crops and water purifiers) but if you want someone who can carry a 10+ player SBQ fight in 2 minutes or less, look no further. We just have different priorities. I'm almost capped on caps on 2 accounts now though, so I'm going to hire the best camp designer to make me several camps for my main / alts.
---
Question, is it possible to make a map of all known flight paths/areas of scorchbeasts?
---
Only the background map is dark. I had to make a compromise there you see - too light and the stamps don't show up. It all depends on your screen brightness honestly.
---
Google the questions. Come on!!! Figure it out like a good Boy Scout would!
---
For that challenge I just fired a endangerol round at a yao gui and just killed it by bashing it once it was at a sliver of health.
---
Yes in the CAMP menu, I've not set one up yet as there is a whole lot of pricing decisions to be made, seems like hard work. The same items vary in price wildly amonst player vendors so need to shop around, but I've pulled the trigger quickly on some items as it sucks to be *thinking about it*, just as the whole CASMP disapears as the player logged off :)
---
I found Rail Road, Atomic and Archaeologist to be pretty simple. They only net you 5 points though.
---
You boys are doing the lords work.
---
X-01 now that the mods aren't a hassle to get. I've repaired mine...once? Repair costs just don't factor into it, especially with Fix It Good/Power Patcher equipped when you do.
---
Looking forward to playing the update this weekend, seems like there's quite a lot to do from what I've read from you guys
---
Added u!
---
For rifles &amp; pistols (unless you plan to use heavy guns or shotguns) it’s mainly: Perception, Agility, and Luck
---
Don’t spend much on Strength - 3 should be enough
---
Endurance 1-3
---
Charisma: 4-6
---
Intelligence: 3 for most perks should be enough; 5 if you want to craft all of your own weapons
---
This assumes that you will switch in passive perks when you need them
---
That's why we need bullets ammo. Sell bulks of 20 or more for like 10 or 15 caps.
---
hey how about one for terminals and locks to pick. terminals would help for the hacker tadpole badge
---
Nice! Do you make copies of your journals and sell em? They look so cool and cute I wouldn't mind having a copy of a documented adventures by a fellow vault 76 dweller
---
Xbox- Classkiown(thats an i in klown)
---
Have serums, ammo, wep/armor, plans, little bit of everything
---
Idiotic people who may well be serving their country and community in ways you have no idea about. We can't all play games 24/7.
---
Real life man, real life never changes!
---
It's currently the most alpha crapbucket of code in the world, so no I don't. But I may do in the coming weeks. The nice thing is though that the hard work computationally is done, and will only need repeating if they make significant changes to the game world.
---
I do appreciate the offer though and I'll keep it in mind.
---
Seems like a great addition to the game. No more having to meet up at locations to sell things
---
Hell yeah
---
Cya
---
Hey OP! These are amazing. 
---
Would it work to generate maps of bodies of water? 
---
not gonna lie I have a really beastly rolling pin that I love. furious, faster swing speed, +strength. excited to get the same with a shovel!
---
I'm concerned it is - they may be downsampling 4k images. It may even depend on your reddit client or mobile browser. I can't be certain.
---
Your furious two-shot Western Revolver doesn't exist because Furious and Two-Shot are both legendary weapon prefixes, and only one of those can appear on a weapon.  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
Looks like it will only take me about 1 million try before I get my BE minigun. I might as well just marry the purveyor.
---
mmmbyyeeee
---
Yea sure add me pokeher1234
---
I like it! Would you happen to be a part of the Marvel Legends community?
---
Why even make a post ?
---
He just said he got out of the navy so he can play it himself. This isn’t a damn distant family member you don’t need to text it and ask it how it’s doing
---
So I don’t have to shoot it to death? I can bash it to death? With the syringer? I’ll give it a go.

I tried that on one of the questions and the answer was 9, but the choices were 7, 27, 46^((I forget if there are more choices I haven't bothered to go check)).

I remember the race to finish the farm story the first night ithe beta went live. With so many beta glitches, it was awesome.
---
I've been theorizing an energy weapon crit based build, kind of like what I did in New Vegas. With the plasma buffs, that might be worth looking into. It's a shame that non VATS crits aren't a thing. Critting half the time for huge damage with Elijah's Advanced LAER was super fun.

Beautiful!

I did just to be safe. And killed it within the 2 minute timer of the round.

I think the pc players should at least be able to type. I’m managing with the slider on console but if I was on pc I’d be raising some hell
---
The damage formula has a 99% limit. If the input damage is several times the damage resistance, the effective damage is limited to 99% of the listed damage:
---
0.99 = 0.5 * (damage / dr)^0.366
---
1.98 = (damage/dr)^0.366
---
1.98^(1/0.366) = damage/dr
---
6.46 = damage/dr
---
Oh that sucks... maybe wait I’ll the bug is fixed? Sorry
---
You do get some interesting a weird 'happenings' in the Vendor CAMPS, being locked inside one while others took photos of a female character posing in sexy clothing, not something I was expecting :D

Both the keypad and the slide. I would appreciate that. It kinda sucks right now.

Google can only do so much! I’m pretty sure there is a list of all the questions in this sub somewhere

Correct. I haven't mapped interior cells because really there's no nice way to do so automatically.

How? You can carry way more outside of power armor? You get unyealding effect, weapon/chem/junk weight reduced effects etc pocketed armor

when night hits, go to camp adams.. west of the giant teapot, it spawns when someone goes there

Atleast you have a camera 😔
---
With rare exception, I sell everything at the value shown in my inventory. It's more than I'd get selling it to the bot vendors so I'm still coming out ahead, and if it makes someone else's day to get their dream weapon for a steal, then so much the better.

When in doubt about why people don't want to get on a mic, it's because they hate the sound of their voice.

Don't be in a team when doing challenges  with the camera. Verified this theory today.

How about a “stop fucking open mouth breathing on open chat” emote?

Is it worth it? Depends. Is it good? No. Is it bad? No. It's decent now, and it gets better with each patch.

There are two at mountain side bed and breakfast, and if you have marsupial or a jet pack, you can hop on a train and whittle them down with another gun and then take the final shot with the syringer

Huh?
---
Cuz ur soppsed to launch a nuke as the last quest and the holotape doesn’t show up till after u launch.
---
Given the amount of content they spoil and the amount of mystery they steal from the world I have zero issues mentally picturing them as extreme mouth breathers.
---
That sounds broken, how do they see you CAMP without a vending machine?
---
This is the only way to get legendary scout armor (urban and forest) in the game, right? Besides Last Bastion (urban chest)?
---
Ok. Sounds good.
---
Can’t agree more. I have farmed some decent rifles so I thought why don’t I start a second character with rifles. It’s so much fun when you’re down to a level 1 hunting rifle and a machete. Totally immersive survival experience.
---
My head canon is that the sonic boom when the bombs dropped left 99% of the surviving population deaf.
---
Can you play as a single player?
---
No, it's always a full one. That's why I jump up there to grab it when I drop TData. Is there a separate ID for 'always a full one' versus 'either full or empty'?
---
My wife and i did the same thing, we compulsively pick up everything and scrap it. "Hard lessons don't come cheap"
---
I mean, wouldn't that be the most opportune time for risk free chances of social interaction.
---
If you get weirded out or start to lose your cool or whatever you just leave the world and find another.
---
I agree. Really though, I don’t think player vending is fixing an economy, it’s creating one from nothing. 
---
There have been a small percentage of players engaged in active trading since the beginning. They’ve been regularly stockpiling caps and items on multiple mule characters and focusing almost entirely on top tier items. As such, only those players could even participate in that market. The other 99% of the player base hasn’t been engaged at all. 
---
We’re now seeing that there’s a wide variety in player preferences and builds, people are interested in all sorts of things and most importantly—for that 99%, they’re more interested in having fun with trading than pretending it’s some kind of career. 
---
The “Elite item” traders will always have their thing, but the real economy will exist entirely outside of it. I think that’s great. 
---
The Purveyor is giving value to the truly garbage legendary items, while still being limited enough to keep the middle tier items viable for player trading. 
---
For example, I could trade a 1* Furious Submachine Gun into the purveyor for 5 scrip—or I could sell it at my CAMP for 500 caps. It’s only a 1*, but it’s the right star for that kind of weapon. There’s plenty of trash to trade in, so I’d rather sell it and let someone get some use out of it. At 500 caps it’ll cover a day of fast traveling (now that I’m addicted to visiting CAMPs) and it might make somebody’s day to find it. Everybody wins.
---
You have some serious nostalgia goggles on if you think that companies weren't always about the $ over enjoyment. Arcade video games were among the most awful, manipulative, money-leeching video game practices that there's have been. I'll take cosmetic MTXs to support a developer making a base game with 30-50+ hours of single-player content plus co-op, plus a road map free updates, events, activities and DLC any day over dropping 25-50 cents PER PLAY on a rigged, difficult arcade cabinet.
---
Congratulations. :)
---
Are you using the pro snap camera or just photomode?
---
Or starfield. Or tse 6.
---
F76 got released way toon soon....period. And it is too easy also.
---
Oh yeah, I could def do without slide bar. The bugs that came with it too where it'd reset to 25k if you went past 0 by one click, but also not go back to 0 from 25k with a click the other way. 😂 I'd even be okay with the PS4 qwerty keyboard popping up. Lol
---
I mean the Scorchbeasts flight is governed by AI so no. The only key would be where the fissure sites are
---
They just need to let us buy (with caps) more storage space and more camp budget. 
---
People are saying we need a caps dump, this is the perfect way! Build it in to the game as a way to progress your character!
---
Congrats on making it thru boot camp! Lots of good new content hit the game while you were gone. WV cryptids now include the SHEEPSQUATCH and you can join the pioneer scouts to earn merit badges (check signs at train stations to start both those quest lines).
---
If you used the pro snap camera in the too right corner it will tell you what you are taking a picture of and it helps you know whether or not you will get the credit for it
---
srsly. I keep I keep a Sheepsquatch staff on me because it looks so damn cool and I use it for photo ops for my cultist character. I would love a bloodied/limb damage/weight reduction sheepsquatch staff. Hopefully someday.
---
Thanks for trying to help though, I do appreciate it!
---
Yeah more akin to this probably. I just want them to stop yelling at me!
---
A big heads up. When unlocking perks the roadmap will show you that no perks can’t be unlocked that level. You still need to unlock something.
---
He has multiple game accounts.  I have 1 account with a total of 4 characters. I don’t need more that 25k for each.  Lots of caps, buy my mats and never scrounge.  Drink inert flux and eat my enemies.  Level 220/ 1400 hours. 
---
I am sure he is legit, but puts more time into than what we know...
---
I call the voice consular Jim
---
Are you sure they’re not just spawning in there? I’m in a popular spot and people spawn into the game at my camp all the time. In my case, I set up vending, so it helps me, but that may be all it is.
---
As a rule of thumb I wish Bethesda would hold off on atom challenges until the new feature relating to them is actually working, or in some cases the feature isn’t even released yet
---
I have one in my vendor right now.
---
The purveyor is already set up to go live they just need to flip a switch. Sheepsquatch was in the game for 2 patches before he went live.
---
Does that come with the dog bone?
---
They can't see it.  I tested this with my son.
---
Maybe this player is just near a fast travel spot?

&gt;communism requires authoritarianism to work, otherwise what if I disagree and decide I'm going to opt out of your collective? 
---
But it doesnt... Sure, there would need to be totalitarianism in order to achieve true Communism. Lenin-Marxist ideology states that a tempory totalitarian rule is required to uproot the current capitalist structure. Many people would die.  They would have to force their law, but this is the case in pretty much any instance of revolution. A communist country could be run democratically by the people still. This is the thing the frustrates me to no end about political debate between capitalism and communism. I mean...Have you heard of the French Revolution? The transition from Monarchy to Republic wasnt a peaceful one. The American revolution was even more brutal. Any time you are causing politcal upheaval there will be fierce opposition from the top that will require some degree of killing. In the case of authoritarianism in Communism and Fascism, it is at the very most seen as a neccessary evil for transitioning out of Capitalism for Communism, and simply the mode of operation for Fascism.
---
Now before you go off about how this isnt the case with past attempts at a communist revolution and that the dictator never gives up their power, think about this. How well do you think a true communism, like the one i described, would fare when extremely powerful authoritarian capitalist governments. The strongest governments in the world. Decide that they are interfering with their growth of capital? This is why Communism seems damn near impossible. It would take pretty much simultaneous revolutions in every capitalist world power. By the way, Capitalism is authoritarian at its core.
---
Thank you so much! This is amazing! Great work to you and your team.

Is there a way to see higher quality images? I mostly log in on My phone and the maps can’t be zoomed in without loosing the quality and not being able to see anything. 
---
Other than that, thank you again and great job!
---
Wierd, I had my friend mod mine for me and we just did it in trade.
---
The trading market at the top if you're in the market is brutal unless you have a crazy stockpile of stuffs - it does take a lot of time trading outside the game to make those deals too.  As a player myself I'd rather play the game and being able to obtain legendaries more easily from others without having to leave the game is a huge QOL improvement in itself.
---
Yup! And it's not craftable either.
---
i’m pretty sure that’s site b i don’t remember it’s which ever one is closer to it

Good players nuke the queen leaving delta or drop site out of circle and fight there so yea nuke zones fighting doesn’t exist for me. If it’s dropped directly on prime i ignore it. Gun fu only works while in vats, meaning you kill one in vats and you switch targets and get one bullet off but then run out of ap.. the dmg bonus is lost. And since your not an unyielding/bloody and an automatic build build i can guarantee your never getting to your 3rd target. So yea it’s a waste.

45 health of life giver(4points) would be better spent points instead of adamantine. I almost never break a limb but when i do a stimpack fixes it immediately so not worth perc points imo.

---
Sacrificing time and putting effort every day ?
---
You think the employees suddenly care and put effort at the game??? Are you delusional?
---
No. the employees do not have the right to choose what they work on. Its the manager, the team leader ..etc.., who after the shit show at launch, decide that its time to fix their mess.
---
 Sacrificing time and putting effort and:
---
\- Put micro transaction with ridiculous price.
---
\- 60$ games with full bugs.
---
\- Almost non-refundable.
---
\- Fraud related products.
---
\- ..etc.. 
---
Thanks god they havent get sued cause its almost illegal. Oh wait, they did get sued lol.
---
And you say its "Sacrificing time and putting effort". What a joke.

Anyone get a crafting plan for it from the quest?

That's actually pretty exciting, thank you for the list!
---
I've been using the one at Dolly Sods when I need yao guai - I was thinking about jumping on the roof to do it.  Did the shotgun one after taking it close to dead first with another weapon, since all I had was a crappy looted shotgun.

Aren't there different syringers that have different effects - I wonder if those help?
---
It's a great game, better all the time

My base always spawns a legendary 3* gutsy or a sting wing. So I’m fine if they spawn it. I’ll kill it for them :D
---
I'm sorry that you feel the need to project your real life frustrations on my post.
---
Still working on it! Overweight so i have to run around the map :)
---
Bodies of water are super hard - because water is just a giant rectangle under the map - the body is formed by the shape it makes when it intersects with low lying land. What I can do for you is [a map of water-flora](https://i.imgur.com/TKFi1kr.jpg) which will *indicate* where water is.
---
Why’s that?
---
Makes sense. I had assumed the smaller file was a list of every item name and its coordinate so the last step was just picking the item names. Once the list of items being filtered to the smaller file is more complete it might not be so ugly.
---
Yeah I was thinking of actually generating the image on the server (if one hasn't already been generated) and serving it similar to what you are doing. I know the calibration part would be a pain so that would be something I would have asked about. If you think it is worth trying, feel free to message me directly.

That's fine, you are entitled to your opinion, even if it's wrong.

Your analogy would be valid, if you weren't able to even start this game, for example.

As it is, it's invalid.

I got that glitch in the toxic valley. It was creepy honestly.
---
**Excavator** for massive carry weight.
---
T-51b or Ultracite for best DR.
---
**Ultracite** has good DR, moderate ER, good RR. Since ER doesn't matter anywhere near as much as DR for pve content (and if you're in power armor, all you should be doing is pve content), it's a good choice. You'll get the plans to make Ultracite quite easily by doing SBQ events. I have 10-20 of each of the plans for the actual armor sitting on my vendor for 100-200 caps each. The mod plans are much more difficult to come by, and the rare ones like Calibrated Shocks, Emergency Protocols, Jetpack, etc., can easily go for 10-12K caps from players.
---
**T-51b** has excellent DR / ER, but poor RR. The low RR is easily made up for by using radshield + diluted rad-x (both usable with mutations and do not nullify or modify your mutations at all). Acquiring the plans to craft T-51b pieces is a real pain, but can be found often enough throughout the world to cobble together a set, although the durability on the pieces is random. If you want to craft a max durability set, you'll need ah high int character with the power armor crafting perk card and will have to either trade for or obtain all the T-51b plans from the Distant Thunder event (huge pain in the ass to get these). Mod plans can be purchased from the BoS vendor.
---
Everything else is inferior. X-01 has good ER and RR, neither of which are terribly important.
---
Someone bought some serums from me and left me a insult bot print out, i sell my serums at 200 a piece, much lower then what I've been seeing from other players. I can only assume he thought i didn't know any better and he hit the jackpot, but my wife and i churn out serums non stop so the price fits.
---
Bye bitch!
---
Kanawha County Cemetery can also be ticks and I think bloat flies. Appalachian Antiques can also be a variety of things like ants, ghouls or radroaches.
---
You can't trade/sell them.  But you can find broken ones in the wild now to repair.  I had 3 broken ones (since the patch dropped) that I could repair, tried to repair 1 to see if I can leave it in vending in case someone else needs a camera, no go.
---
For me 220+lvl is it one of best game ever made. It is open world with tones of content. I love it exactly like i loved old wolrd of wacraft.
---
580hours ingame. I had 1k on Dota. Where you do exactly same thing every hour.
---
I'm seeing a lot of people with this complaint - I'm afraid the maps may actually be *too* highres and some mobile clients are downscaling them. Are they really super shitty? I can't recreate this problem myself.
---
Change their camp, add a door or move something that blocks the spawn point or move it, or someimes it's as simple as unlocking a door as most people put the vending machines outside and often people are spawning inside.
---
Because we have friends we enjoy doing things with.
---
Nice job!

I've got a solution for looking at this in moblie. Make sure you request the 'Desktop' version. I had zero issues after that!
---
Operation: Tidy at Kiddie Corners Cabins gives them too.
---
This is amazing! A couple suggestions:
---
1. Random encounters: See my post here for what info I dug up that may or may not be helpful: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5hqce/updated\_map\_of\_random\_encounter\_locations/eje29wl/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5hqce/updated_map_of_random_encounter_locations/eje29wl/) I'm mainly interested in the 4 main types (Assault, scene, travel, and object), not the purely random enemy spawns or leveled lists (I think these are referred to as 'ambush' in the files). Those 4 should be noted with different icons. 
---
2. Are these maps easy to update? The reason I ask is that every time they make an update, these locations are likely to change and could get very out of date after a few patches.
---
3. How hard is it to tweak colors? Some maps would be a much quicker reference if they were tweaked a bit. For example, your nukashine recipe ingredients should really have the cyan color be the quantum locations, then maybe yellow for razorgrain and green for corn. For workbenches, blue for weapon, green for tinker, yellow for power armor, red for cooking (fire), and then flip a coin for the rest. Just some thoughts.
---
4. The idea of using shapes+colors would be great, not just for color blind people. 
---
5. And another vote for working with someone on making this an interactive map. If you get the programming set up, all you should have to do is extract and parse the data and then just upload to a server and you're done. You wouldn't have to generate all the individual maps. But this is me armchair-quarterbacking, so I'm sure there's more to it than that.
---
6. Uncooked food. I know there are places that have fixed raw meat spawns. That'd be great for crafting some recipes if you don't want to hunt down a random spawn of some animal to kill.
---
Again, thanks and keep up the good work!
---
Hey man, I was able to get it done last night, but if you still need to do yours, I’m more than happy to help today, just hit me up
---
Brah 1300 is dirt cheap compared to signs and letters (9k caps I believe). This is something you spend a lot of time in. Whack a bunch of ghouls in WS will fill your daily 1400 quota fast.
---
That's why East Hampton estates is on there it is always them.   It was just a little bit of extra places that might be able to help people.
---
I put at least one guaranteed spawn location of each bug

---
Oh christ! Yeah that is definitely not the original image which I uploaded! Thanks for sharing. I'll edit the post. Since I can't recreate this, please let me know if you find a solution. There may be options such as "request desktop site" perhaps on mobile. Alternatively if you're not on WiFi this might happen.

  Maybe as she was exiting the launch site by the lake...if forget the name... she was attacked by the yogi...fell into the lake... almost drowned, but for a good samaritan  tadpole scout who happened by, took out the yogi with his trusty crossbow, and stimpacked her just before her head slipped under for the last time....

Ha! Good for you

I bought out a MIRV plan from a vendor bot recently, iirc it's the Pleasant Valley one.
---
It’s for when not having anything to sell. Just flip the switch to ahut off the vendor. Or things that need power.
---
I bought 1 piece of gear for 26k... i also saw a be lazer get sold for 70k. It’s easy.
---
I love my explosive 10 mm machine gun. It has explosive and double damage when the mob gets below 40 percent health. Since being a machine gun means it is an ammo sink I usually bring it out for tougher enemies once I get them below half health.
---
And? That doesn't make what bethesda is doing is good. To just do what is expected of them as a company isn't doing a good job, that is just doing the bare minimum to not be horrible.

---
Why do mole rats need to open doors? They can apparently dig into the ground and pop out of my roof.
---
I remember when you actually had fast travel mats for your camps. God I miss those days. Especially now as a vendor I have one room locked in my entire camp, my personal water purifying shed (there are others out there for player use). No matter where I place the camp base, visitors spawn inside that room.
---
Had to unlock the door and instead lock all the purifiers. Either that or rebuild the entire camp.
---
Turning on and off power seems to fix lights when for some reason they'll stay turned off. Besides that i like having things organized.
---
Sell 3 mutations for 1200 caps in 3 seconds. The mats sell for less then 100 caps each
---
Alright, then what they are doing is bad.
---
Whatever makes you feel better, man.
---
If you're level 89 and haven't figured out the point of the game besides the main story, this sort of game may just not be for you. 
---
I don't say that to be a dick, but around that time is when I got into all the looting/trading aspects as well as the grind for gear/appearances I could be proud of. Plus now there are several end game events and areas worth grinding which keeps things fairly fresh, and if you keep changing up your build you'll find new ways to play.
---
People on xbox seem to like it, they buy some and then add me as a friend, i can only assume it's too come back for more for friends or they realize they can double their money by selling them to robot vendors for 400 caps.
---
Well technically Charlie Wilson, the CIA, and the Russians reeeeeaaaaalllly wanting to be in Afghanistan for some reason. I salute Reagan for never pushing the button, about as much as I salute my cat for not crapping in my cereal. His calling the Russians evil to their faces certainly didn't help. But SDI (star wars) sure did scare the crap out of them, so I'll give him that one.

If you want to talk about stopping total atomic annihilation, talk about Kennedy. Literally everyone and his brother egged him on to invade cuba and push the button, but he refused. (And they likely killed him for it).

Now it’s serums
---
Try the Top of the World train vendor (I just got it there) or the Raider station all the way north of there
---
Great resource!
---
Is it possible to do one for Royal Jelly spawns? Three of them are needed to make one of the items for the Cooking scout badge and they’re nearly impossible to find. Not to mention there’s two item IDs for them - one as Aid and one as Junk - and only the Aid type can be used in cooking. 
---
the hanging logs were what kept tripping me up.
---
include the turret as an entity in the frame. it seems to always need a titel to be poped up... the location does not in camera
---
This way I got it with the terminal.. and the mainframe in the back... on XBox
---
Ok literally anyone who disagree with OP is either "you are wrong" or "cry about it". Oh well, I guess there is no room for different opinion. GG.
---
Sure, but you'll get my point. 
---
It was marketed as finished product, not some early access/beta/alpha shenanigans.
---
Im happy as it is.
---
That's a common glitch. Even if you're in a team it didn't show sometimes..
---
- Plays a multiplayer game as a single player one.
---
- "Game is dead."
---
Cool story bro.
---
Well, it's all fun until you're not home and cool things happen. I guess you could place down some turrets but i honestly have no idea how well they fare against those annoying gutsies. They chew through my armor like a hot knife through butter.
---
What is this even saying
---
Raider area (Savage Divide) vendors seem to sell them.  10,000 caps give or take depending on perks and charisma.
---
I have been made aware that on some mobile devices the maps are coming out [absolute puke quality](https://i.imgur.com/FUIC5bS.png). I can assure you they should not be doing that and that's not what I uploaded to imgur. It may be several reasons such as low system memory, downloading over mobile network or just your reddit/imgur/browser client putting caps on image resolutions. It's also possible that your mobile may be taking years to download the image, and you're getting that while it waits. I can suggest primarily using these on desktop. Failing that, try to load only one image and not the entire album.
---
Most of my vendoring sales have been ammo at 1 cap per, I can't complain when people are buying them :P sure beats leaving them on the ground for people for free like some kind of communist!
---
sorry mate, but you're so wrong it's not even funny.
---
in first place, i never mentioned the scorchbeat queen. there is still people actually nuking whitespings. which implies going into the nuke zone for farming. even more so now, with the legendary vendor incoming and people farming crappy legendaries to sell.
---
and even if it was nuke site prime, sometimes you just wanna go in there to harvest some flora, you know.
---
you're wong about gun-fu too. you obviously haven't paid attention to all the perks in luck. running out of AP? riiiight. and what are you talking about not being an automatic build? did you not see the 9 points into all the commando perks?
---
dude did you even bother to look at my links (the original one and the one i posted later)? apparently not.
---
you might have a point on the stimpack vs. spending limb perks tho. i'll consider that.
---
As in the raw plan or the plan already learned?
---
This is awesome ! Thanks! Even for someone that's been playing since.. the beginning this is very helpful. I never do quite remember where I find certain things
---
What platform? I’ve got an extra set. (Ps4)
---
I remember feeling that way too young dweller. I still occasionally find places I haven’t discovered and I’m still waiting for that explosive weapon drop lol.
---
Maybe that one had opposing thumbs so it could grip the door knob.
---
You cant actually learn the plan, if you have it it shows up as known, so you only need to have it in your inventory in order to craft it, currently a bug
---
I thought so! Thanks for confirming
---
Didn’t even think of that lol you’re right
---
Not a chance, I will never pay money for another bethesda title after fo76, full stop. They will never get another penny from me after this cluster fuck of a release.
---
I have no idea where you are getting this idea that they are putting in "TONS OF WORK" the majority of the items they have added in are directly from fallout 4. The "DLC" they are giving away was datamined and found in the base game at LAUNCH. So it isn't that they created that DLC after the game came out. It was already in the game, just blocked off until later so they could say "Here is free DLC" when in actuality it was already in the game at launch and they had just made it inaccessible to players. 
---
That is just more damning towards this game. That they are trying to claim they are giving away free dlc when all they did is block off parts of the base game and open them up later.
---
Barrens chat is a condition which occurs when you have a large, sprawling area that is the primary means of leveling from 10-20 (The Barrens area of Kalimdor).
---
Barrens chat is like a stupidity centrifuge, distilling the unexpurgated banal thoughts of a thousand morons into a hardened impenetrable lump of smacktardery, spilling endlessly across the bottom of your screen.
---
Agreed. I skipped out on launch so I missed whatever happened there. Coming to it a few months later is a perfectly accept online "survival" game. Better than most of them out there actually, especially if you are into the Bethesda style fallout theme.
---
I'll give it a run through level 50, see all of the content and then move on like any other game. That alone will probably be around 100 hours, which is perfectly good entertainment for the price.
---
I think a lot of the hate has to do more with the abandonment of the RPG/storyline components. But if were honest, that's pretty much Bethesda in a nut shell. They make theme parks.
---
Sweet I’m also on PS4. What’s your psn?
---
Interesting! I have 7 possum tokens so I was planning on getting it tonight and that's good to know
---
I'll put that on my to-do
---
I agree with this. Some people are doing it to troll. And I’ve seen a lot of “sky bases” with open rings you fall through and die. Because it’s funny I guess. I’ll defend a base if I’m able to. And will repair a few things if I didn’t buy anything. But I’m currently not buying anything if your sky basing.
---
&gt; cannot throw anything away in this game.
---
Why not?  I drop stuff all the time...  and selling it for 0 caps is basically throwing it away, just takes longer.
---
Same name. I’ve got it for 4K
---
This isn't very scout-like.
---
This makes no sense to me. It not a single player game you can beat lol.
---
Is it possible to add a section for power armor cores?
---
Yeah half the badges seem bugged with not registering.
---
Not a man, and don't feel bad at all. I'm just laughing at people like you who are letting a triple a studio lie to you repeatedly, pull shitty anti consumer actions, and down right breaking laws.
---
Bummer . . . (scrap)
---
Those people are depriving the rest of us of their undoubtably stellar personalities and 90 percent of the time when someone hates their own voice everyone else finds it just lovely
---
SBQ is not animal anymore.
---
No. You want specific perks too. How about that Berserker’s 50cal with bash damage and +1 luck? You gonna love it like your baby?
---
If you get it would you be willing to let me borrow for caps? What we can do is ill give you a huge number like 15k caps, I craft one, then sell it back to you for 14k or whatever so you make a profit
---
My favorite color blind mode in games is when it adds symbols to stuff.
---
I'm not color blind though.
---
Ok deal. My psn is Colbyrules12
---
Sounds like your camp is in a popular spot if this is bothering you. FWIW, designing my camp to be 100% mobile has made life easier.
---
Ah okay, now I see what's going on here.
---
Your sub is this way -&gt; r/fallout
---
No bandwagoners on my post, please.
---
I like the floor switch on my vending machine... no reason, other than the fact I like the "mystery" behind the "sometimes there, sometimes not" camp icon on the map. Walk up to it, machine turns on, walk away... turns off. 
---
Like I said, no reason other than "I think it's kinda neat".
---
I've been all over that. RNG is too strong for anyone to have it.
---
Right on. I’ll be on for a bit for lunch, otherwise we can meet up this evening
---
I think this is the reason.
---
This is to allow players to have diff types of cameras.
---
Have you had a chance to see where bethesda released a straight up stolen D &amp; D campaign? Literally plagiarized the story directly from WotC, and released it?
---
Whatever makes you feel better, boy.
---
Anything else you wanted to say?
---
i did something similar to someone's camp earlier, i left the bag at their door step with 1 fertilizer in it. because they where asking 1K a bobble head, and their machine was on their roof. hard to find
---
Im having it for a roleplay character that is a hunter and i want to shred animals i already have a humters machete
---
you could make one with every power armor station
---
Oh yes they used a stealth build with a suppressed lever action and shot him from the grassy knoll  I remember know.
---
My base is blocked off 100% with turrets, but I have a shack above it that has the vendor.
---
Sure, I'll let you borrow it! The caps number can be a lot lower than that too since I'm so close to max, lol. Just give me like 3k as a deposit and ill give you 2 back :D
---
For any one else who comes across this, check Sutton Station. Got em there the other night.
---
If you play on PC I have a lovely safe discord you can join, we wimmin look out for each other there
---
I'll be on after 6 PM EST
---
Alpha works, thank you! I was hunting around for something actually part of sugar grove.
---
THIS is the kind of thing I was hoping for when the game launched.
---
LOL, I'm a woman little boy, your misgendering of me means nothing just proves you have no point and are just a typical bootlicker.
---
Damn is this real? So many wasted caps
---
Ok then, have fun :)
---
This is what i don't understand at all: I hear other people saying they're spawning in the middle of camps, but no matter where i put my little camp machine thing, i spawn well outside of the camp circle. Moving it around just spawns me somewhere else outside the circle. I don't know if it's just me, or that's where other people spawn to, and i HAVE spawned right in the middle inside other people's camps, but i can't figure out how to predict spawn points at all. Seems completely random.
---
Kind of irrelevant but WHERE THE HECC CAN I FIND A CONSISTENT WOLF SPAWN
---
I wonder why they opted to not have every weapon on the list. Not seeing any black powder blunderbuss, chainsaw, ripper, enclave plasma, and some of the more recently added weapons. Even weirder considering that I absolutely have a legendary ripper from a random drop.
---
Start anew character and how they redid the Morgantown airport was amazing! Having to find a key card, new basement in there, and how they altered the layout just a bit different. I was impressed.
---
That's the curse of the gaming industry these days, I'm afraid.
---
Agree
---
Sounds cool.  I’m not sure on the gecks. 76 didn’t have one. And 94’s exploded and created the mire. So no idea on the other vaults. Seem odd to give them one if “WE” are too “rebuild” America.
---
Oh alright cool yea! I just mentioned a high number in case that helped! Ill be trying the armor plated one later, so if the same thing happens ill hit you up so you can have that one too. What time will you be on?
---
Oh, you're not saying we won't get new features before the 21st, just that we won't get a new patch.
---
Yup, i fell once or twice too, luckily i'm always in power armor. But yeah, it's a really dickish move to build bases like that
---
It also wont let me out the magnifying glass on wood!!!!
---
Alright, saltygirl.
---
Anything else?
---
I'm here for you if you want to keep projecting your frustrations on me, don't worry.
---
I have that mod or a similar one. It does make it darker but still not super dark. Dark enough though I feel I need a light. Combine I'm playing it in vr with a mod that lets me point my pip boy light with my arm makes really good immersion. Though sadly I can still see the enemies coming cause the game renders them so they stay lighted under the game's original darkness so they stick out.
---
Not bandwagoning. I am a former game dev and I have pulled fo76 apart and not only datamined the shit out of the game, but also am reverse engineering the servers to release private servers.
---
Maybe you should stop making baseless assumptions just because someone won't lick bethesda's boots and let them get away with blatant bullshit.
---
Let me guess you also support them straight up plagiarizing from D&amp;D too don't you?
---
Has anyone noticed a change in overconditioning armor and melee weapons? The AR and DMG isn’t increased with fix it good and weapon artisian anymore.
---
I have a bloodied ripper so I know they can drop. This is a new feature so they probably just missed some of the weapons
---
1/44 chance of getting the gun I want then another ridiculous percentage to get the bonuses I want.
---
 I was pretty excited about the legendary vendor until I realized all of this.
---
I built my camp on the edge of a cliff and sometimes when I spawn in (and when others spawn in I assume) you fall like 20 feet and break both your legs. It's not enough to kill you, just break half the bones in your body
---
I keep getting 4/5 on Archer and althelte
---
Thanks for the suggestions!
---
1. I'd like to get them out the game data, automated. Otherwise It's not reliable or fast. But this is something I may look into
---
2. They are easy to *generate* EG if you want a map with certain things - easy! However if BGS go and regenerate the game world - then no sadly not at all. It's approx 14 hours to re-export the whole map into JSON.
---
3. Easy. But not for automation. I wanted this tool as automatic as possible. I could do custom colors for each map, but I've already provided near 30 maps today and custom colors for each is just a massive time sink. Currently you'll notice it just has hard-set colors for items 1-16
---
4. That's probably my next thing - this would be surprisingly easy.
---
5. I'm hearing this, but actually that has already been done (see my credit to /u/wully616) However I wanted something which avoided the downfalls of those maps (notably slow and hard to use)
---
6. Good idea. I see that is an item that could be mapped so I can add it to my requests to do later.
---
Yes, please. This bugs me to no end. XD
---
Have I’m missing the point but what’s the point on sky bases. There’s nothing in game that can instantly demo your camp. If it’s a smol pp thing or ego thing. It’s sad.
---
What I don't understand is why the vendor fast travel point and the owner fast travel point are two different locations.    That would at least stop the appear-in-foundations issue (unless the owner is landing in his own foundations, and somehow doesn't bother to fix it).  I suppose there may be fringe cases where someone would want to land inside his house, say, while having his customers land elsewhere.  But those seem comparatively rare, and generally less troublesome than the problem OP mentions.
---
I can see the hesitancy about welcome mats, at least.  We'd get twirps putting traps at their landing point, etc. etc.  Of course, we can do that now, with the added step of having to wait and watch where potential customers are landing. I know I spent my first couple of post-patch hours revamping my garden, when I finally noticed customers were coming down on top of the anti-varmint punji boards inside the fence.  Could have just as easily put in some pressure plates and or whatever on the spot.
---
I only have enough camp budget for 2 turrets... :(
---
Sweet, I'll be interested to see if armor-plated works the same too. Once I'm on I'm gonna try and grind out that last token :) Just let me know when you're ready
---
Oh sorry, I didn't realize I was talking to a frustrated nerd. 
---
Reverse engineer a brain, please. Might be useful to you.
---
I've been trying to haha, no luck so far
---
Check last patch notes. They changed its class so you can't pacifi scorchbeast. So i think hunter efect wont be working on them anymore.
---
Thanks! To be as specific as possible, it's in the locked storage room with the terminal by the door. Moving counter-clockwise around the room there's a green chest, an overseers cache, the corner of the room, and then along the back wall a big computer-like thing. The canister spawns on top of that prop.
---
Keep crying.
---
Need to invest some skill points in happy camper.
---
Gotcha yea whenever you get on lmk and ill be on, ill help you with grinding if anything for the challenges were you have to collect things or whatever if needed
---
renawana - xbox 
---
i have fasnacht masks and serums
---
As long as the perks aren't useless in most situations (like Hunter) I'm good.
---
Fuck, I can't even imagine. I've had nightmares about it and I wasn't even alive when there was a significant threat of nuclear war. I'm sure lots of other people have too.
---
Personally, I'd rather get vaporized in the initial gamma ray flash, really close in, rather than die slowly from my organs liquifying. Or worse, being at just the right distance that sets you on fire, but doesn't immediately kill you. Concussion wave would be my second choice, since it'd still happen faster than you could perceive.
---
1) Make a camp next to lake or river  
---
2) Place down water purifiers. A lot of them. 
---
3) Get hard bargain perk. Level 3 preferably
---
4) Sell all of the purified water.
---
You are looking for Site Alpha.  You have to go inside the complex for the photo challenge.
---
Yea. And it makes me sad seeing new games and thinking "ah this has potential" instead of "oh what a great game"
---
Where are the musical instruments at the Rusty Pick?? Where is Nukashine? These challenges are very buged
---
Why not both
---
I have done! See [here](https://i.imgur.com/jk3UYOh.jpg). If you really specifically want Power Armor only, that could be done but hopefully that will suffice
---
Maybe a glitch? I sold a couple last night.
---
Fusion cores? I'll check - if so, consider it on my todo list
---
Lmao dude, I am surprise you dont spam one more "cry about it". Having fun sucking Bethesda D. GG.
---
I do have one for my Vault Dweller journal ( seen here with a link to the store if you like what you see https://imgur.com/gallery/4rh8B5U ) but this is a new project so I haven't quite finished it to the point where I could put enough together to print for it to be worth folks time
---
Nice but when i go to a Dollar Store everything is a Dollar or under. That why i go to the DOLLAR Store.
---
My BE Dragon does 1230 damage a shot
---
You are reading me too well
---
Tbh. Instigating.
---
It's a fucking game. They need to balance it so you don't get powerful or rich too quick or the game gets boring quick. As you said, they get nothing from this tax. So obviously they are doing it for game balance reasons. But good to see you have such a big chip on your shoulder that you see conspiracy everywhere. Not to mention that Anne Rand is a hack and I would not want to live in her world.
---
I've been playing so long I remember having to make sure you didn't have any carry weight effects active before logging off.
---
There are more tbf. Like Socom 4 and Zipper Interactive. THAT was a shit show.
---
Graham can sell it too :) buy meat to help him out also u can reload into the world and his plans will refresh
---
I would like one too please :D
---
I can't see why you would even need the backpack in power armor if you have modded your power armor with calibrated shocks. Backpacks increase carry weight right?
---
You needed help finding a cheap copy?
---
Jokes aside, hope you keep having fun with it. It's definitely better with friends. I'm looking forward to when I can finally use power armor. :)
---
Oh I had this happen to me
---
“Since your NOT AN UNYEILDING BUILD and a automatic build.” I know reading is hard but try again. And yea sorry haven’t farmed fluara since December. Since you can buy them for 30-40 caps each.
---
There definitely needs to be a solution to this, I'm just not sure at the moment what the right solution is. Fast travel mats could be exploited by spawning visitors into a death pit, kill them, loot their junk. Spawning on the edge has its own problems, I have a character whose base spawns you on a cliff edge, sometimes halfway down the cliff. You could do a height check in the build area and float the character up until they're on the ground, but that's a server overhead on servers that are already somewhat stressed. Maybe check for player intersect before the spawn location is chosen? Could be the simplest solution.
---
I don't know what's best.
---
The camp travel is most definitely a problem though, easily more than half the camps I travel to I spawn like.. in the toilet, in a locked basement, and easily 10% of the time, maybe up to 30%, inside a wall or a floor and unable to do anything but impotently jump on the spot without actually moving anywhere making angry power armour noises. 
---
I trust that they'll look into it though, I've only been playing a couple of months but I've seen them create new content, identify and correct bugs within a week, then do it again two weeks later. I've seen evidence that they're actually listening to and learning from the player base, and are working hard at developing the game into something better than it is.
---
But you still can repair your items with scrap? You do not need repair kits.
---
The idea is that this is done by two people, a Shia and Turtle, vault 76 explorers messing around in the wastelands ( you can see my first 76 page journal of their adventures here https://imgur.com/gallery/7QkTjtk - and edited and available for print here https://imgur.com/gallery/4rh8B5U ) - generally Shia, the main more important explorer, does all the nice hand writing and drawings, and around the camp fire she and her friend Turtle doodle on the page and pass the thing between the two and the more rough jarring doodles are her friend helping out.
---
Are you high or drunk ?
---
ROFL, A nerd? Sweetheart, I'm probably old enough to be your mother, and I am far from a "nerd". Also why would I be frustrated? I'm having a good laugh at the bethesda bootlickers who can't handle anything negative said about this shit show of a game.
---
Why is it you are so frustrated that the majority of people can see how bad this game is? Do you tie your self worth on this game? Is that why you are incapable of having anyone rightfully criticize this game? 
---
Why can't you handle that bethesda did lie to you? Do you like having parts of a game you buy being held back from you that you can't play until later when they decide to "release new DLC" even though the "dlc" they released was already in the game since the BETA. LOL
---
The amount of good work they've done to the game has restored my faith in TES6 being worth the decade of waiting.
---
I was legit thinking about reinstalling after I checked out destiny 2 reddit for the new weapon and secrets, but this scares me
---
Bethesda as a whole deserves some credit, but it’s really the dev and community teams that should get the majority of it.
---
For those of us who have been around since launch, I’m sure most would agree that the game needed to spend a few more months in the oven, and I’d bet much of the dev team felt the same way. They were up against a deadline enforced by corporate and whether or not they voiced their concerns, it was marketing and PR’s decision to move forward anyways and it bit them in the ass. 
---
Corporate continued to screw things up with the canvas bag fiasco, the overzealous bans, the support system breach, the “write us an essay on why hacking is bad”, and so on. The devs don’t deserve any of the backlash from that. 
---
As for the game itself, the community team listened to our feedback and the dev team knuckled down under pressure to make it better - to make it what it should have been at launch had corporate listened to them and the community. 
---
So, props to them for sticking with it. I hope they get the recognition they deserve, and I hope Bethesda learned a thing or two.
---
I’m not really into tracking people down to sell stuff at what’s its “worth” on the free market. If I can get more for it than selling it to a vendor, then it’s a win for me. Also, I’m selling stuff I can’t normally sell, like ammo. Actually, that’s the only thing that has actually sold at my shop. Just ammo. 
---
So for me, it’s a matter of convenience to be able to get rid of stuff I would normally either toss out or give away. Or even sell to a robot vendor for much much less. I usually price things at the suggested prices if available. 
---
I haven’t yet sold the matching pepper shaker to the previously sold salt shaker by another player vendor.  I’ve even got it marked down by 60%. Going for the low  low price of 10,000 caps. 😉
---
You don't have to use repair kits, you can still just use scrap.
---
You dont have to use repair kits to repair things, you can still repair the old way just added another step.
---
Did...Did you even try to repair it normally? Repair Kits are an option, not a necessity. Do some research before you cry on reddit. Repair your stuff at a workbench with your precious resources, like 90% of people still do.    /facepalm
---
The left arm has DMG Resist: 12 and 20
---
The right arm has DMG Resist 25 and 20. And both the Forest Scout arms have 25 and 20.
---
Genuinely curious, what’s the status on anthem? There’s no way bioware doesn’t plan on updating that game.
---
You can still repair them with junk. Thumbs down on this one. 👎🏻
---
The photomode shots you take are stored locally, so your friend would see them on his game when he plays 76 on the console.
---
You could take screenshots of the photos which would be uploaded to the cloud, but they wont be used as the loading pics when you play on your own console.
---
I'll add another, courtesy of playing Fallout 4 while sometimes waiting for a promised update (*cough* Legendary Scrip *cough*) or while just plain burnt out from the game.
---
4. The game acts as a giant QA session with play-testing, bug-squashing and player feedback with Bethesda Austin and us at its center so that future Bethesda games could run smoother in the future. 
---
Of course, they paid us in game service and [community fun,](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bjrexa/the_reason_why_i_will_be_locking_my_door_from_now/) so that's a good deal.
---
Examples:
---
* Physics became relatively frame-rate dependent, which eliminates an indirect pay-to-win method on the game; this "bug" exists in FO4 and will not be patched if 76 isn't there.
---
* Features, gimmicks, and bugs got reviewed by a lot (legendary balancing, update roadmap, 400 -&gt; 600 -&gt; 800 stash space, slap damage griefing, etc.), which obviously impacts how they would implement new features and how they will interact with us in the future that does best for all parties involved.
---
I'm lvl 197 and still find places on the map I haven't discovered.  Now with the scout challenges, there is even more to do. I truly love this game
---
Because I have two different Dragons.
---
Then Don't sit on your ass and get some scrap, no offense
---
How? I hit the repair button and it says I need a repair kit. Then takes me to the atom store.
---
High.
---
You don’t need repair kits.  You can still repair weapons using weapons benches and scrap just like before.
---
Ugh, reductiveness.  I'm saying if there aren't meaningful drawbacks it's an especially obvious choice - virtually mandatory to optimize your build
---
 In other words, going without it should have SOME benefit.
---
Sure, once I’m on I’ll reply to the comment 👌🏼
---
Which guns you want to use is a big factor here. Also need to know if you want to be a stealth character or not, and if you'd like to use power armor or not. I can't post my build guide here due to subreddit rules (no linking outside subreddits) for bloodied power armor with heavy weapons (highest dps build in the game), so I'll PM it to you.
---
If you collect numerous quantities of the parts, you could potentially spam the quest and get the rewards several times in one go.
---
Well good for you but not the answer of my question.
---
Why do you have such low self esteem and self worth you have to tie it to this shitshow of a game? Why do you struggle to be able to accept criticism of this game?
---
Honestly, from my training in mental health, it seems like you are the one with the issues here, tying your self worth to a product you purchased... That isn't healthy at all, especially when it is a game this bad.
---
Xbox - Encyclops selling serums and random stuff
---
Have you even tried to repair your stuff before writing this post?
---
This is just as good! Thank you so much!
---
I have a TS Dragon I was thinking of selling. Can anyone suggest a decent price..? Not sure what to charge.
---
I don't see the Instigating in the title.
---
The answer is go for a bloodied explosive imo
---
...that's rather specific
---
Its a guaranteed 3* . Get a grip . Did you think you would be handed god rolls ???
---
Its more than fair for the most casual players !
---
For the first time, I feel like I'm playing it the right way. I'm doing challenges, interacting with players, and I'm paying more attention to the environmental storytelling.
---
Probably explosive then. Two shot affects weapon condition more and with explosive you can run demo expert and get more damage
---
I know!!! Damn hunger and thirst mechanic, shutting down my in-game video game time.
---
This is outstanding. I'm not even playing right now, but I'm going to save your link for my future enjoyment. Thank you, thank you!
---
Bye Felicia
---
Grognak nails old school RPG gaming, to a "T".
---
Are your stairs snapped to a roof or a floor tile? If a roof tile, try rotating the roof tile 180 degrees and then placing the wall. If floor tile, you should just be able to rotate the wall to face whichever direction you'd like.
---
Great Idea. I'm never able to use those shelves though. I have two functional camps and both have space limitations.
---
Honestly, I've never read something so untrue in my life lol. Dude, try exploring the other options while trying to repair at a bench. You'll see the option to use materials. You're not forced to buy anything lol. Yikessssss.
---
You need to use the "workbench repair" option.
---
…  you ...can … save? Wut?
---
If i only had a choice between the 2, I’d go with the 2 shot.  But that’s just my personal preference, less chance of blowing myself up when I shoot an enemy that is right in my face.
---
I’ll get online right now
---
Wow, that's .. just wow Bethesda, how that wasn't found in any form of testing .. jesus.
---
The Langoliers
---
You have to inspect it first then pick workbench repair if I recall.
---
Leave it as an rng. Giving players the option to chose their reward is bad.
---
That's not a disadvantage, its a cost
---
You are not supposed to launch a nuke, it was a players desicion todo so. I bet if you don't nuke, you will get different holotapes afterwards, when they add more progression to the main storyline
---
It happens when enemies within the rendered area respawn. My camp is near the whitespring golf course (out of turret range lol), so whenever I'm at my camp and I stagger, I know the ghouls have respawned. The bug actually works like spider-sense
---
Showed my kids that episode when they started reading. They could relate
---
&gt; Why not? 
---
Hoarding is real in this game
---
BEST RP STORY IVE READ! Id give that person my collection of switchblades!
---
Thats the way to go 👍
---
Don't let it since it's not true. You can repair the normal way too, same as before.
---
can't wait for my great-great grandkids playing tes7
---
Hey, OP still gets my upvote for being a creative thinker, despite the idea being unneeded!
---
Thank you brother
---
Sadly that "dlc" they have added so far to this game was actually already in the game since BETA. It was just set to be inaccessible by bethesda so they could unlock it later as "free dlc". When all they really did was not give us access to the full game and then release bits and pieces of the full game later as "free dlc".
---
It is actually a really shitty move on their part.
---
There's an instanced spawn next to the big tree by the grave in the civil war cemetery. I do that event a lot and people are always asking for a shovel when they're standing five feet from one. One spawns for each player doing the event. Sometimes there's a pile of them there because they fall over onto the ground because so many spawn.
---
Awsome, thanks! I just purchased that journal a few min ago actually, I cannot wait I'm excited for it ,😬 lol it's one of the coolest/cutest thing I seen in a while
---
&gt;Nuclear Winter is going to be an arena/br type thing inside Vault 51
---
Wait, what?
---
I've been playing since launch. No beta, so subtract good boy points if you like. I've also never been to China but based on my personal 30+ years on this planet I completely understand their reasoning for religious and cultural identity. Moral of the story, you are not a special snowflake that can comprehend all of human behavior.
---
It all seems a bit too Minecraft for me. I happened upon a floating base, and I instinctively started looking for Creepers. I like Minecraft, just not in my Fallout-verse.
---
Op is either trolling or stupid, you don't need repair kits to repair your gear, just like every comment you scrolled through in here told you.
---
But you are throwing it away by putting it in your stash and selling it for 0 caps.
---
Easiest explanation would be that one of the less known vaults here, for example 51, was Vault-Tec's production center for GECKS. They had to make them somewhere, right?
---
Wow, you don't seem to understand the basic issue here.  If you use a mod and Bethesda finds out about it and doesn't like it they can ban you from the game.  There is no way to get your access back.  Go ahead and use them, I don't care if you get banned, but I'm not taking the risk without an explicit seal of approval that we can use that or any other mod.
---
I have same issue and its not helping. I did scan and repair first, then deleted, redownloaded and reinstalled game, same issue
---
At the bottom of the screen it should have two options, one for repair kits and one for bench repair.
---
Np!!
---
Atleast we got a few quests  , its so awesome 😂
---
I know - downvotes coming , im used to it
---
Oui I know, but as of now, the Enclave Urban/Forest armour is not on the actual loot table, except for a unique one which everyone gets, I'm more happy that they're at least being added onto the Loot table as of Patch 9.5
---
Then specify that you want only “that” kind of answer. I was simply giving you an option. Don’t like it, then don’t respond to it. Good day.
---
It’s definitely a huge QoL improvement. I’m not a fan of farming. The fact that when I’m low on ammo I can just go and buy all I need instead of farming ore, then acid, then steel, then mashing buttons until I have enough... Yeah. Huge improvement for me.
---
Just TS? Could probably get like 2-3k for it. TSE goes for ~8k+
---
The "Quick-Boy" view doesn't,  though.
---
More content, but same crap when it comes to bugs and glitches. Also crashing is still a thing. Worth playing if you have patience, not worth plying if you want a fully released game that actually behaves like one.
---
He's not in-game yet, but on May 16th, if you head to Berkley Springs, there's a abandoned Train station boarded off, it'll mostly likely be opened on the day The purveyor is released.
---
Dito, and hey, my camp deep in the Mire often gets visits by 3* legendary enemies, consider that a free bonus for my visitors!
---
What good work have they done? I've been playing since BETA, and honestly the game really hasn't gotten majorly better. It has just gotten slightly less of a buggy mess. It is still very much a buggy mess that most people would say feels like it is still in BETA.
---
On top of the fact the "free dlc" they have been giving out was already in the game since the BETA and was just locked. So the "free dlc" was just them unlocking the full game for players who bought the game. That isn't a good action on their part and they do not deserve any praise for pulling that shit.
---
You deseve my preserved pies! People like you make the game fun!
---
If you ask me. Floating and sky bases should lose durability the longer the stairs, beam, posts are supporting the whole of it.
---
You seem like a bit of a cunt.
---
Ah yes, Blood Bath &amp; Beyond, a tired name used by many an MMO guild for years and years. Good to see people still borrowing it and making it their own!    
---
I personally like Riders of Lohan better, but whatever.
---
Seems you are the only one crying that everyone is calling this game out for being shit.
---
Don't tell anyone, but I pretend to not have a mic in almost every game because I don't feel like speaking to people. I just want to play the game and catch up on podcasts.
---
Np! I always wanted to a rock a set, but it never came really viable to me doe to other armours having legendary effects, but now since that's changing I might me be able to get a decent set of them!
---
So their study was a "limited" 100 Hiroshima sized weapons (aka peanuts) nuclear exchange. And that still kills 2 billion people due famine. Fuck.
---
We have nukes now that are... how many times bigger than that on average? So in a Fallout scenario, where everyone justs lets em fly...thousands of warheads, several per target...earth should be fucked for a while. 
---
Shit my theory just *might* be possible for what the Nuclear winter quest could be: Fix the broken weather machine. We could see a heat/cold system of survival, more scarce food, yeti's? Who knows.
---
This is literally not happening to anyone else that I have heard about.  I repaired my guns just last night in fact with no issues.
---
Are you paying attention to the menus? Bethesda did change how repairs work a little while back. You now have to click two different buttons/keys and then confirm the repair.
---
That's fine man, you can keep being salty. No one will blame you for it, life sure is hard.
---
Thanks for the update. 
---
It wouldn’t be modern ‘Fallout’ with some hiccups like that...
---
So...
---
Anything that exists in game.  Didn't we pretty much suspect that?
---
I have mostly given up on playing 76 because I got bored with it, but I have not played since the big Faschnacht(sp?) event.  Do y'all play other games, too?  I would not mind just chatting about games in general...
---
Lol I remember getting that power armor glitch ages ago and started thinking my character was done for and I'd have to start again until I found a fix
---
Look, I'm sorry that life is treating you this bad. I really am.
---
Stop it. Get help.
---
1.You should be able to. There are xyz coordinates of the encounter location markers. I've just not been able to figure out the system for the markers as there appear to be several in close proximity for each encounter location. I think some are triggers and some are the actual spawn locations.
---
5.You might look at what waffle\_cop is doing on this at nukacrypt. Take a look at our comment chain here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bij7r4/update\_on\_nukacrypt\_new\_features/em24579/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bij7r4/update_on_nukacrypt_new_features/em24579/) Might give you some inspiration on ideas to avoid the performance and usability issues of other maps out there. Also, we discussed options for items in interior cells that you might be able to implement.
---
Pvp only seller, no stashboxes anywhere. You want that dirt cheap ballistic fiber/aluminum/lead you better have a game plan too get it to safty.
---
Experienced this as well! Glad that you made a post stating it!
---
Not me I would by them all even if it meant i had to earn some extra caps behind one of the red rocket locations. I currently have 41 weapons on me.
---
DC or Vault-Tec HQ. Braun in Fo3 made them right? So yeah somewhere but DC would have been likely. But how many were really made and worked. 
---
It seem odd to have gecks in an area where a Vault was spear heading a rebuild by hand. That’s would spark rivalry with two vaults very quick.
---
Oh damn yeah completely forgot about sheepsquatch weaponry! I'd love for a Instigating sheepsquatch staff with the burning barbed mode, it look so cool!
---
And hell, if later on legendary pipe revolvers are added, maybe I'll actually use that mass amounts of .45 ammo I have, because my Combat Rifle and Lever action don't burn through the damn quick enough XD
---
The cake is alie as usual with bethesda
---
Have you tried going into build mode to see if it was destroyed by NPC's?
---
r/fo76Guides would appreciate your work.
---
That's fine, you can keep throwing tantrums all you want.
---
I'm here for you, my man.
---
Oh cool, I hope you like it! I've gotten good impressions off people who have already, be sure and tell me what you think about it when you get it!
---
What gap, there's a quest marker right on the robot you have to talk to.
---
Alright, salty.
---
Is that why you are crying everywhere in here about how people are "bandwagoning"? Is that what it is called when you call out shitty games for being shitty?
---
I wasn't aware the whole world was just "salty" about ride to hell retribution too right? Seeing as it was also universally disliked for all its bugs as well. 
---
Is that what it is? You just think anyone who points out issues is salty? Why would I be salty at the fact that this game is shitty? That doesn't even make sense.
---
Oh, there are people playing Ark. Occasionally we play Borderlands 2 but it's mostly fallout 76.
---
LOUD NOISES
---
I think we should rise up and praise Geraldo.
---
It's both a boom and a bust; on the upside if you have a lot of good items to sell then you're going to be rolling in caps. Downside: Nobody wants to fast travel long distances and nobody wants to buy things that aren't 3* Legendaries/Serums/Rare Plans. That seems to be the case on PS4, at least.
---
What is Scrip? I'm coming back after a few months of not playing and I dont recognize this word.
---
That's it, bring out all your salt.
---
You will feel better soon enough!
---
Damn, if the pioneer scouts had some top tier armours, they'd be pretty savage for a scouts group XD
---
"Sir, Jimmy is on the archery range with a silenced pistol and not taking care of his knot badge, I'm going in"
---
\*orbital strike just casually happens on Jimmy\*
---
"Mission complete" \*pops stealth boy and skeddadles away\*
---
A very simple but welcome addition.
---
Yeah. I love FO4 but 76 is a product of greed and laziness. And yet, I feel like if u dare to try criticize it, you get downvote to oblivion  :(
---
You can change the event. When you gather sticks if you only get dry wood you'll get the wendigo, the damp stuff gets you bugs and a radscorpion
---
Are you projecting? Is that what it is? Your life is such shit you have to tie your wellbeing to this game? LOL 
---
What are you even talking about with the "life treating you bad"? I retired at ~30 and own enough rental properties to where neither I nor my daughters will ever have to work again in their lives. How exactly is that "hard"?
---
Do you mean as in the sense that it says 0/3 badges? If so then no. And I believe they are possum scout badges not tadpole. You need the 3 tadpole badges to get upgraded to possum which rewards you with the back pack. Idk if that helps
---
Also, each time you log into the game you should just be able to select the weapon loadout you want with whatever legendary effects you prefer, and you should also be able to select what type of flux the SBQ drops, the type of hardened mass/glowing mass/High rad fluids glowing enemies give you, what sorts of plans you earn for completing events, and you could select how full fusion cores you find in the wild would be. Oh wait, that would be pretty stupid. 
---
The only one I kinda see is it would be cool to be able to choose a base weapon for more scrip, but I’m still happy with this new setup. No re-rolling current weapons, otherwise where’s the fun
---
Oh hell you've got way more than me!
---
Everyone has different play styles and values different things, and a crappy weapon for their build might be god tier for yours. For example, I don't want a revolver, but I see requests on the trade boards regularly, so if I get a good roll I can post it for sale on reddit, if it's "good enough that someone will want it" I can throw it in my vending machine for 300-1000 caps, and if it's complete shit I can scrap it and get 40% of my scrip back. 
---
Conversely, a furious super sledge with faster swing speed and +1STR isn't very useful to a VATS crit sniper build, so there's a good chance they'll come to the same conclusion and I'll stumble across it in their vending machine. 
---
You need to think big picture and consider everyone's rolls, not just your own. With tens of thousands of people generating new 3 * weapons every day I think it's going to be increasingly easy to get the thing you want, even if you're not the one to roll it.
---
Thanks! &lt;3
---
I'm curious about how the spawns work - do they ever change, or will an Acid node be there til the end of time? Are they the same on PC/XBOX/PS?
---
Interesting I didn't realized it was budgeted different. Icedcracker187 is my psn. Add me if you would like. I am at a point were I would like to start grouping with people and experience that aspect of the game.
---
Sure thing! Mind if I message you once I gone through it?
---
Step 1: Encumber yourself
---
Step 2: Forget that you can sprint
---
Step 3 : ???
---
Step 4: Profit
---
I don't think you know much about 76 buddy, back to the circlejerk you go, i'll stay in my echochamber
---
PM your account login details pls
---
You can now scrap legendary items for currency (scrip) at train stations we will have a legendary purveyor on May 16th where we can trade scrip for legendary weapons I'm sure someone else will come behind me explain it better.
---
It's not like that, it IS that. They added equipment you'd be a fool not to use. Choice is a no-brainer; virtually mandatory for anyone interested in optimizing.
---
Lmao, the game is far from being dead but okay.
---
I can second this! I found a broken camera inside a duffle bag that was inside a tent!
---
 Nice!
---
PM me with the info, please.  I cannot get back to my computer until Monday, but it would be nice to join y'all, if I can.
---
So, you can read the entire loot table? Anything about Urban Scout armor? Or is wood armor in the 3* loot table (let's hope not!)?
---
A couple other things I just thought about. 
---
\- Treasure map dig locations
---
\- This might be more complicated, but a map that shows the nuked versions of the flora (but not the abundant ones). It's hard keeping track of what turns into what when nuked. It'd be really great if you could put it in order so that each type of raw flux gets the correct color on the map. This might help give some variety to the places that are nuked if we can see what type and how much flux we could get in an area.
---
prices vary wildly...
---
its up to you.. do you want top dollar..? do you want to just be rid of your inventory?
---
Move your C.A.M.P. Unit outside. That should solve the problem.
---
That was my vibe when I read this.
---
Hit me up, SupaFlyEbbie on ps4. 
---
Also, lights are a big thief of budget
---
Im pretty sure they meant max selling per day (1400) not max storage capacity per day (25k)
---
Here is a spreadsheet with all of the answers,

---
I have a two shot and with vats it's hard to land a hit. I mainly use it for scorchbeasts, mirelurk queens or other big things. If I hit them it takes most of their health though.
---
Haha, yep, when you exit Grognak it saves your progress, you will pick right back up where you left off.

Simulated Gaming Addiction
---
Honestly this is one of the few multiplayer games I've really been able to get into
---
Yup, you are one of those no selfesteem basement dweller that ties his self worth into the game he is playing. You should seek help dude, you are tying your life to a game and not even a good game. 
---
Is that literally all you can say is "WAH YOU ARE THROWING TANTRUMS. I"M NOT YOU ARE." like a child? The whole "your mad" response only works when the person is actually angry. I have no reason to be angry, I don't tie my self esteem to a game like you do.
---
yep, and i just found out that my armor bench and a square of my roof is missing too, ffs.
---
i deleted my video folder and re-verified the game, and that fixed it
---
Bethesda.net Launcher\games\Fallout76\Data\Video
---
The flux idea is interesting - the question is what approach do we take? If I put all flora on there as you can see it's just a clusterfuck. I could do maps for each flux color?
---
Holy, Super Mutant soufflé, noice!
---
I'm not really spec'd into melee, a pure Rifle+carry weight build due to my hoarding habits from Fo4 carrying over, but hell the Instigating Rolling pin does really well with a simple sneak attack!
---
&gt;Except without the ability to trade item-for-item, there's no safe in-game method to trade an OP legendary rifle for an OP legendary shotgun.
---
Sure there is. Pick a reasonable value for said weapons and buy them from each other. I sell you my legendary shotgun for 15k, then I spend 15k to buy your legendary rifle. Worst case scenario, if someone tries to scam you at least you got 15k for your gun or you got a good gun for 15k.
---
Cya, you certainly won’t be missed.
---
Doesn't matter how many you have, when you drop it off you lose the entire stack. It's impossible to drop off one by one.
---
I'm sorry that you feel the need to validate yourself infront of Reddit strangers, friend.
---
Hey, take a walk, get some fresh air. You'll feel better, I promise.
---
God how Could I forget such a weapon that surpasses even the gods!
---
SSSSHHHH!!!!!  
---
\&gt;&lt;
---
Amazing
---
I don't want to drop off one. I want to know if I have 4 or 9 etc
---
As an alternative, if you go to white springs and talk to the brother hood vendor, you can purchase the plan for cheap and build one yourself.
---
Those were dark days. I don't know how we did it considering 800 isn't enough anymore
---
I'm a game dev who worked for Midway, and have datamined and made mods for fo76. With how its going it seems I know more about FO76 than the dev's at bethesda do seeing as I've made multiple mods to fix bugs they seem incapable of fixing themselves.
---
I felsh werd myby dont plaey mmckay byy
---
No. They cannot be exchanged.
---
1) I’ve been playing since launch
---
2) no idea what China has to do with this
---
3) congrats on 30+ years on this planet, same as myself
---
4) I don’t think you read correctly snowflake, I said every person I’ve met along the way playing hasn’t done anything except for 1 person destroying my camp, in no way did I say EVERYONE. Majority doesn’t mean in whole. So yes 1:25 times the 1000+ servers I’ve played is a very very small part, so I stick to what I say and the VAST MAJORITY aren’t going to harm you or your camp.
---
I love you
---
It's actually next Tuesday. The legendary vendor goes live then and patch 9.5 is the week after that
---
That's only one part out of like 8 for the athletic badge. Check under world challenges, it has descriptions for how to earn badges.
---
&gt;but in general, one-handed is comprised of 80% joke weapons.
---
My bloodied faster swing speed switch blade takes offense to that comment.
---
That's all well and good for you but I do not use or believe in 3rd party sites. If it can't be done in the game then I have no use for it.
---
Maybe I'll get lucky finding one on a player vending machine someday but I doubt it.
---
 Any 3 star weapons that I don't want or don't need will go right back into the legendary trading machine. No matter how good they are for other players it doesn't help me.
---
Scrap + Chip = Scrip. 
---
you get scrip from the new legendary exchange machines by all train stations. trade in unwanted legendary gear for some
---
Exactly. OP needs to go back to fortnight, COD or Minecraft.
---
You're in for some bad news friend
---
It's not anything. There's a lot of weapons absent from the loot pool for her. Ripper, black powder blunder buss, enclave plasma just to name a few
---
Yup, also too stupid to actually offer any sort of defense on why the game isn't actually as bad as it is. Funny how all you can do is repeat, "nuh uh you're wrong." while stamping your feet. Let me guess you are a trump supporter too right?
---
r/iamverysmart
---
What’s what I don’t want to have to do. But I might have to 😕
---
The alien blaster :)
---
That's it: cry, scream, let all of your salt out.
---
I'm here so you can vent, friend, not to talk about other's personal lives as if I knew anything about them.
---
But if that's what it takes for you to make you feel better in your life - go ahead, talk about me all you want.
---
Do you remember when you could kill a bloodbug with a commie whacker?  Pepperidge Farms remembers...
---
I know right? Post is pure cancer.
---
If I read this right there are only two Mysterious Boxes found with data mining. With both Mysterious Boxes found, what should the third location reveal? I have searched between box two and vault 76 for two hours, including following the roads between the two locations. I found some interesting unmarked locations but nothing else.
---
Everything is either cheap or not purchased. I haven't seen many weapons selling for over 2K caps lately, and it seems like most people are broke from spending. I know a lot of people seem to browse a while, maybe looking at weapons and armor they can't justify buying or can't afford, and then buy some small stuff because they feel bad leaving without buying anything... so they spend caps they wouldn't have spent otherwise despite not having a lot of caps to spend. I think it's really brought the economy into better health quickly.
---
I wonder how the ebay sellers who are selling weapons for real money are doing... I bet the guy who's got nearly $3k in sales of rare weapons is having a bad week.
---
facts =/= opinions.
---
There is no way to know unless you count.  And if you disconnect/serverhop/log out before using them, it resets the hidden count to one.
---
And yes, there is a difference in turn ins.  It does change the Exp/Caps received if you hae one, or two+.  (No change in exp/caps for values above two).
---
Affect on drop rate would have to be studied, as rates are relatively low and most results are just "feels" currently
---
Very nice.
---
Oh, people have used it before? I thought I was clever as shit when it came to mind.
---
As someone else pointed out, it's missing the dragon, so apparently not everything is on the list.
---
Says the dude who is trying to validate himself by defending fo76. ROFL
---
So are you capable of actually having an intelligent conversation and explain why the game isn't terrible, or do you literally only have the "you're just mad" reply any time someone points out all the issues this game has?
---
That's fine, friend. You can keep calling me names and talk as if you knew me at all. At the end of the day, I'm the one with no regrets.
---
Then you have to count when you pick them up. Dropping two is optimal btw.
---
Me placing on Starched Genes and popping a Rad-X
---
“How do you do, fellow human?”
---
I dunno about that.  The work they've done was mandated by the fact that they said at the outright that they'd update the game for a year after release.  Don't do that and with the quality of the game at release they'd be facing a second class action against them on the basis of false advertising.
---
The next few games they put out, their quality, and the lack of need for updates that exceed the base install of the game will do more to restore my faith in them than anything connected to FO76
---
What I mean is that in order to keep people from just dropping off a bunch separate to get multiple rewards the game always appears as if you have 1 regardless of how many you pick up. It only resets when you complete the quest. So it doesn't matter how many you think you have you can only ever have 1.
---
Sorry I forgot the E lol. It is a TSE
---
And thank you!
---
Im going to find you in game, give you a scribe outfit and a preserved pie for this great idea!
---
Your not supposed to be able to pick up more than one at a time. When i can i always get the bugged td on the floor of my camp
---
Happens every time for me now. If you hit them, they chase after you.
---
Yeah, at the end of every play session, I’d play a round  “To keep or Not to keep”. Then I would go to the nearest train station and put all the excess in a a cash register.
---
I like the way it resembles a CSA flag.  Nice work!
---
Or every shoulder button press moves 100c. Something helpful since so few items are gonna be 5k caps or more
---
Someone is really grumpy that they scrubbed out of PvP.
---
Is this true? I moved my camp machine and it moved where I personally spawn when I fast travel back. I used that to be able to specify where I land myself in my own base. It's unclear to me why other players would behave differently -- why don't they use the same location as I do -- but clearly they do.
---
A lot of us still won’t trust another fallout game and will be wary of Bethesda in general
---
the ALERTs are inconsistent, professor
---
I love all the events where people team up. All the content has been great!  I would love to build little towns. 
---
I really wish Bethesda would clear several locations on the map and allow small camps to be placed next to each other.   Maybe only give us 25 pct budget in these areas.  Each area just needs 24 different "Lots". We can blue print our builds so when we log into a new server you just find an empty square and drop the blueprint down. It wouldn't matter which square because they would all be sized the exact same, and a small house or shop would be easy to blueprint.  They could have some pre-built structures like empty houses and defensive walls in place.  It would be an easy way to have faction specific areas.
---
Each "Town" would need communal crafting stations and water purifiers. Throw some fusion generators down that everyone can hook into and bingo!  You could have defend events similar to the workshops.
---
Can you imagine the kick-ass markets and fortresses people would make?  It would be amazing!
---
The whole point is the more you bring in the better the reward.
---
Is that not the case anymore?
---
Exactly, I've offered facts on the numerous bugs this game has. Hell, I've even made mods to FIX the bugs that bethseda seems incapable of fixing themselves. All the other dude can do is claim "you are just mad and salty". Why would I be mad or salty? It is literally just a game, who cares if it is good or bad? 
---
Like he literally can't accept that the game has issues and everyone who points them out are just "bandwagon riding" when they point out the hundreds of problems this game has.
---
Any plans to do the other factions or even Vault 76?
---
She flew over the border, trump still hasn’t managed to scramble jets over the border yet. He’s probably just as confused as we are as to why she’d wanna leave such a terrible, broken down, poor country. Oh wait
---
Just read the Inside the vault, it does say that the Purveyor will be on the 16th which is a Thursday, I don't think there's actually any slated update for Tuesday, but my bad Patch 9.5 is coming on the 21st May, which adds the new event Project Paradise.
---
Not a bad plan. I hoarded guns so I've got 30 for sale and people flock to the store to check it out. Being centrally located is a huge help too
---
You're very talendted! I love this!
---
No you didn't...your character wont go past a certain HP no matter how long you starve or are thirsty
---
Look, it's simple. This post was simply an appreciation post for Bethesda's employees who are working hard. At no point did I intend to have a discussion of why this game is or isn't terrible.
---
And then you came in with all your negativity. But don't worry, that's fine. Because I know that those who spread negativity around them are just sad, and they need help. So I'm here for you.
---
a quite good place for critters spawn is just to turn left and walk a bit when you spawn at R &amp; G station (savage divide). I found chickens, rabbits, squirrels, possums, and a few other there by server hopping a bit. Just vats a bit and you should find them.
---
Actually, Dorothy Mantooth was a saint.
---
Yeah yeah it was for childs for anyway
---
I’ve learned to aim for the legs rather than the body, and I hit them more often when I’m crouched. Who knows, take it with a grain of salt. I’m sure they’ll fix it at some point *knock on wood*
---
I server hopped all day doing the campfire quest, nothing in my camp came up missing and had to hop for camp location many times. I did experience a bug after server hoping for camp location, if i opend pipboy right after landing in a new server id just freeze in place and id have to close game though
---
LOOT MY DEAD BODY DAMNET!
---
Never claimed I was "very smart". At this rate with their actions I think a trained monkey could do better than current bethseda. I mean they literally just tried to plagiarize from D&amp;D campaigns.
---
The ore veins and "hardpoints" (where you can extract with your camp) are a hard-set part of the game world and won't change.
---
Only visible difference in rewards is the Exp and Cap reward for One vs Two or More.
---
I have actually already xposted there :)
---
the game is essentially fallout 4 with multiplayer, if this game is indeed factually shit, then so is fallout 4, and fallout 3 and new vegas, oh wait that game was shit on release, crashed every 10 minutes usually I find the games that don't crash to be the ones that aren't shit.. sucks having these incredibly hard to meet standards.
---
Still a higher chance than you currently have. You can at least guarantee it's ranged and guarantee it's 3 star, whereas currently its purely RNG between armor/melee/ranged AND the star rating.
---
I can't. 
---
I start getting anxious and cold sweats when I'm 1 lb over, and outside of walking distance from a workbench/stashbox
---
Some times you shoot psych-oh, then everbooody knows your naaaame.
---
IM CRYING! This is so beautiful!!!! When does the hard copy come out?! I want dibbs!
---
So yeah, you are too dumb to say anything but "You are just salty". Why would I be salty? It is literally just a game, I'm not the one who seems to be so mad that you can only respond with the same phrase over and over. Why do you have such an obsession with fo76? 
---
Why would I have to be salty to know when a game has bugs and major issues?
---
Massively overpowered. No matter how expensive you make it, it still makes it certain that anyone can get their dream weapon. That isn’t the intention. The numbers released through Inside the Vault are actually pretty fair (which surprises me tbh).Remember you can trade in the 3* you bought for 100 scrip for 40 scrip, so really they only cost 60.
---
Priorities. Nothing more to add
---
No this is not season 8 of Game of Thrones
---
It looks like none of the photo taking challenges are working for me or my friends. If anyone else is experiencing that
---
I don’t get this take? Don’t like it? Cool, sure. 
---
Dead by end of year because you don’t like it? Nah dude.
---
they don't drop them is the bad part it's a random loot item from containers , best bet is to look thru (meat sacks), like the mutants have around them.
---
I didn't know people were so fond of the furious SMG till I sold three of them in one day for 750-1000 caps each (1k for a 2 star with 33%vats). They were actually the only gun I sold yesterday. People chose them over bloodied shotguns that were the same price, which surprised me.
---
thank you! rebuilding my camp for the umpteenth time (patch9!!!) went from 0 to 256 in no time 😘
---
You can build a Terminal that will accept a holotape.
---
I found it there. There are a lot of cut trees and its easy to get confused. Look for an abandoned/destroyed truck a little west from the tower, just past the fence. From the truck face west and you'll see a cut tree a little to the right, walk next to it. Again, face west walk to the biggest tree you see (again, it's a little to the right), you'll find it next to some bushes on your way to the tree.
---
Not sure about question one but i know it doesn't have to be a teammate, and unless the person is willing to go into pvp i would suggest either jumping from a high area out of power armor that doesn't kill you but downs you, or using an explosive weapon at your feet until you go down (i used the explosive method and it worked like a charm).
---
Unyielding Armor + really low health = +3 Charisma = $$$
---
Welcome back. How’s the search bar?
---
I had same issue earlier today...try reloading into game
---
which mods?
---
This bothers me that its still broken
---
It does count as both, my friend got both requirements with 1 revive on me last night.
---
Edit: Also, any kind of down works. We just built a 3 story stairwell on a shallow water bed and jumped in
---
my partner (and even I, often enough) can't fucking read the text in this god damn game (and many others) because the font is clearly meant for ants and not humans
---
I've explained the intentions of my post in my other reply to you.
---
I know it will take extra work your brain isn't used to, but you will get it eventually.
---
There's no obsession here. Just appreciation for hard workers. If anyone is obsessed, is the person who gets so mad and frustrated about a simple videogame.
---
I can't complete the sugar grove one for some reason..  :(   We've been trying for multiple places with different angles but still no luck.
---
*and other challenges are just way too grindy so I guess I'm gonna take a break today.
---
So, again, vast majority is a neat term. It implies everyone yet could mean only one person. English is cool.
---
And Dr. Ken is glad you paa-a-aid....
---
Hold up.. does anyone have a legendary shovel?
---
you cannot die from starvation or thirst in this game it only goes down to a certain HP like around 12
---
I could try. Enclave and BoS already have one. The only other faction would be the Responders.
---
The game has made a lot of progress since day one so yes it’s definitely worth it. The game is now getting regular content updates even
---
You should add you ID and platform so we can visit you.
---
Also, try jiggling your camp module. You can kinda change your spawn points around if you rotate/move it.
---
Which is a disadvantage.
---
Yes a lot of people are experiencing this, and while some may actually be bugged, it is most likely that they’re taking the pictures “wrong”. One thing confusing about the photo challenge is that the name of what you’re taking a photo of has to be displayed on the screen on the top right in a grey/white font, otherwise the photo won’t count. You can be right in the animals face, with it taking up your whole screen,  and it’s name in bright red at the top of your screen but it still won’t register unless it’s displayed at the top right as well. Sort of reminds me of Pokémon Snap. Took me about 15 snaps of the big fossil until I figured this out and positioned it perfectly
---
Lol, hour before there was post, that was same like post that was here 2hours ago, that was absolutly same like your fucking post.
---
Use search for posts like this. Thanks!!!
---
**breaking news** 
---
death by falling damage numbers skyrocket in west virginia post apocalypse 
---
Everybody downvotes everyone here - it’s like the tide going in and out :) I actually prefer 76 to 4 - but that will probably change in the future - in and out - like the tides.
---
People take things to personally these days - love to get offended - love to complain - but it’s all ok - just pick up you controller and go your own way.
---
As an AC fan this just sounds incredible.
---
If you’re on play station one of these days I’ll get on and show you my setup
---
YES IT IS!
---
Athlete challenge was a lot of fun haha
---
You just happened across a server with rare junk items. Months ago I found one like that and there were all sorts of weird named junk on it. I tried saving a lot of it but it all eventually accidentally scrapped.
---
Next time it goes on sale for $30ish I'm gonna pick it up.
---
Hahahaha. Those things just have drinks sitting on shelves. Who restocks them?  ;)
---
Me too. Makes the campfire event a huge pain in the ass.
---
First, I personally would move brain and glowing fungus off the abundant map to common,  not just for flux but for farming in general.
---
If you're going to do it all on one map, can you control the layering? Like, lay it all on one map with common laid down first, then uncommon and then rare. Obviously leave off the abundant and it's too crazy. That way, the common stuff doesn't hide the uncommon and rare by being on top of it.
---
But then, I do like the idea of a dedicated map for each type. Idk, maybe try one both ways and see what's more usable. All on one would help you decide a location for maximum variety of flux. Individual maps would help you target a specific need. For example, everyone knows where to get violet at. I struggle with the best location for crimson.
---
My friends are all getting them from one guy that's duping them. I have two bloodied explosive laser weapons that I think came from him
---
I think the game is really worth it. With all the updates and things to come it should only get better.
---
That was an employee working for Zenimax Online, who are completely unrelated to anything doing with BGS AND Fallout 76.
---
Yup. Happened last night. Went to bed. 
---
Maybe will be better tomorrow
---
I sell Ammo generally no more than 1500 at a time. My stuff usually goes in a few minutes.
---
Though vending has been far more effective for chems/booze/bobbleheads and other assorted items.
---
You freakin rock! Thanks so much
---
Ah I must have missed them. Thanks for pointing that out
---
I very intentionally experimented with my camp spawn point so people will spawn in the shower, then filled my shops with 25,000 cap lure items.
---
I am curious of some examples of triple big budget games that came out and were abandoned less than a year later.
---
I'm sure there is some, but I keep seeing people say Bethesda cpuod have just abandoned the game, but, that very rarely happens and they launch an online game with at least a year of updates at least planned. It's just seems like a weird thing to say. They were never gonna just abandon the game
---
This will become an essential companion tool for many dwellers. I hope everyone appreciates the many hours of work that went into this by taking advantage of its precision.
---
Too bad I'll never sell any of these items in my vendor stall anymore LOL
---
nah.. youre better off waiting until they work out the bugs
---
How do you get it so perfectly on the bed?
---
Wouldn’t the vault 76 flag just be their logo imposed onto a normal flag?
---
I really like how the flag look like the Florida Battle Flag
---
PRAISE
---
i'm on PC...
---
You cant even pass those tests with this laggynes of this game.Run fast trough agility course sure but u have to jerk in and out those flags or they ignore u
---
I have a pc account too
---
No problem, glad to help the cause! It's an amazing tool, I would use it on mobile ALOT. So finding a solution for mobile users is great!
---
Take my upvote, couldn't have said it better myself. You know how many of us kill 3 star legendary enemies all day and get 1 star loot? At least this will guarantee a 3 star item in the class of weapon im looking for.
---
I think I have one. Will have to confirm later, after work.
---
Wait for what? Here, let me help you. Wait and count to 5 and then get your credit card and purchase. "It just works" :)
---
Yea i found that instantly. I mean i couldn't find next part.
---
No this is Patrick
---
Level 275 here. You gotta meet people. That’s why I’m still playing
---
that doesn't mean you have to reply
---
um not it's not, most people like being just under carry rate
---
Tons of new or returning players post stuff like this everyday, so I guess it means the community is expanding fwiw ;)
---
Oh but don't tell him, he *clearly* knows more about 76 than  Bethesda
---
That is very true.
---
 I'm just worried they put guns like the handmade that I would be after a very very very very low percentage chance of getting.
---
 The same way they added a high percent chance of rolling pins, drills, boards and such being dropped in the wild
---
 I should have  1000 scrip by the time the vendor comes around.  Just curious to see what 10 weapons I receive and if any of them will be duplicate crap ones.
---
"The Queen's Queef" - LEGEND!
---
hmmm
---
Yeah, I'm talking about part 2. I just realised directos for both involve a vehicle.
---
Did you actually get a quest in your log?  I downloaded the coords and nothing happened.  Now my 1 character doesn't have it at all.  Other character the alert is still there, but no quests triggering.
---
I really wouldn't bother, the game is dying, no new content, full of bugs and the player base is now tiny and shrinking, waste of money....
---
Seeya!
---
What platform! I’d gladly purchase 😎
---
UPdate, I couldn't fix my missing roof, there was something there, so relogged and guess what popped back into existence. Everything, thankfully.  phew
---
Indeed it is fun to play.
---
But the problem is that it has not been translated for the French.
---
So since it speaks fast and of poor quality, we can't understand everything.
---
&gt; Look, it's simple. This post was simply an appreciation post for Bethesda's employees who are working hard. At no point did I intend to have a discussion of why this game is or isn't terrible.
---
And I just came in and pointed out that they actually aren't working hard, due to the fact that the "dlc" they released was already in the game and just set as inaccessible, or the atom shop outfits and camp parts are just straight copies from fo4.
---
So exactly how is that being salty by correcting someone who may not have realized that the dlc they "added" was already in the game?
---
 &gt;And then you came in with all your negativity. But don't worry, that's fine. Because I know that those who spread negativity around them are just sad, and they need help. So I'm here for you.
---
Once again, just pointing out issues with the game, and correcting you when you mistakenly thought the things they have added were new when they are actually from either fallout 4 or were in the base game at launch isn't being negative. That is just pointing out facts. Facts don't care at all one way or the other about "negativity, or saltiness". 
---
It boils down to the fact I was just correcting your incorrect assumptions about the game. Not to mention, these tiny patches every week isn't "working hard" a single person could push out these patches in roughly a day or two of coding. Why do you think the camera had the emote bug with it? Because there was no quality control, or even bug testing.
---
Hell, if they are working so hard how do they manage to release a patch that reverts previous fixes?!? I mean since patch 5 a dupe has been back in the game and the "spam disarm on traps" glitch was also added back in and is still in. 
---
Pointing all that out isn't about being negative or positive, it is just the facts of the situation. If you take that as just looking for negatives in the game or w/e maybe you should take a step back and think about that. You are seeing the facts of how the game plays and the issues it has, and those facts themselves are bad enough for you to feel like pointing them out is being "negative or salty".
---
That is quite sad and I really honestly don't understand why you feel the need to tie your self esteem into this game where you feel people pointing out the issues the game has as attacks on you. But you might want to seriously try talking to someone, because that isn't healthy at all.
---
I didn’t say anything about dying from the lack of food or water.
---
Not to be a MW paperclip, but I think the correct sentence would be, "I have never experienced this before, but I feel strongly enough about the subject to assume the experiences of most players is not confrontational. Also, I use terms that a vast majority of people could misinterpret."
---
Added, Drankster033
---
I’m sure I didn’t do anything to warrant a ban. At this point I’m hoping the next time they do a random maintenance it’ll be fixed. I don’t know what else to do. If you figure something out please reach out to me. I love the game as well. I have equipment with this character that was hard to come across in the first place. It sucks not having an answer or explanation.
---
Just ignore them. Straight troll. They call someone else a boot licker in a post three weeks ago yet now venting frustration = salty.
---
FO76 is most definately worth it.  I regret daily not getting it on PC.
---
Just a laggy server. I was on one that had five player vendors on the greens and at the train station and the place was a nuke zone. There were ghouls walking through walls invincible and you'd be getting attacked by invisible ones. I bought some stuff from a guy and server hopped away from that mess.
---
+ you can get some scrip back from it also
---
Not as of yet! But I want one when the Lego vendor comes out!
---
*drop 1200lbs of it.*
---
Uhh yeah. Pocket armor glitch. I was away for quite a while, heh heh.
---
Really? Nice way to own the bug. I’ll keep this in mind! Thanks for sharing
---
And? What does that have to do with anything? My point was that the issue is there are major problems from the top down in the company.
---
Maybe. I just figured bring the “Great” Vault 76 would have had a more flashy banner or flag or something.
---
Yes it gets better with every update
---
I agree, BGS have said they don't plan on keepng the servers running for much longer, most of the developement staff have been moved to other games, running on empty, running on fumes.
---
Yes, it shows that there are major issues in the company from the top down.
---
no i was telling the OP
---
Instigating + sneak is the greatest.  I picked up a 1 star instigating hunting (sniper) rifle in my 40's, and was immediately killing things I had no business fighting.  I still haven't found a replacement 100+ levels later.  I'm seriously *trying* to try a different build/loadout, but so far I can't.  (plus I Have crap luck with drops).
---
Because, according to the fallout lore: Vault 76 was sealed a year before the Great War (I believe)    So it makes sense that the pip boy 2000 would be used because the pip boy 3000 hasn’t been adopted yet. It’s similar to fallout 1
---
Wow that makes a lot of sense. Do they give a lot of leather or something ?
---
I'm selling ammo at 1 cap and gain caps for them.
---
We, your filthy bloodied customers, are not so fond of mandatory showers anyway, but joking aside: Why would anything about your camp change by trying another world? You haven't also moved it at the same time, I guess. And you're sure the shower is not under the &lt;STORED&gt; tab?
---
Well I can answer that last question now and also add to your knowledge. Yes, when you voluntarily move your CAMP without dismantling it first it does pack up everything under a temporary blueprint. HOWEVER I can explain better with my story. I had my CAMP under a hydro tower. High concrete walls on three sides and raised concrete block floors with concrete stairs leading up to the main floor.  I was pleased with it. When I moved it was going to be to a ledge hanging over a cliff (great view) but clearly not the same set up at all so the temporary blueprint was useless to me. Here is the "however" part. I couldn't build anything! My old camp used up so much material that I had to literally had to go through and scrap each item one by one until I could start over. .SO! It works but not so good if your new local is radically different.
---
Yes this worked for me, thank you:). Who would’ve thought:/
---
Since it's not max level probably like 1-2k
---
If you did it your way, every person would have two shot weapons. It’s just a way to get a chance to get something good for the junk legendaries you already find. Plus a 3-star anything is usually valuable in some way.
---
I’ll take free advertising for free. But thanks
---
Your grammar gave me a headache, time for a nap.
---
You have Reddit prices, Facebook prices, and individual ideals of what it's worth. Put it up for what you think it's worth and if it doesn't sell drop the prices a bit. Eventually someone will come along that values the item and purchase it. I will say i see a lot of people doing 200-300 per star, and obviously explosive weapons raise the price. But the big ones are bloodied explosive, anti armor explosive, and furious explosive, those weapons from my experience sell for much more. Good luck!
---
And thank you BTW ... I appreciated the help!
---
not sure but o know thats the only way to find them is random containers
---
THE LORD...
---
The only drawback to text chat is going to be the inevitable "BUY \*\*\*TSE HANDMADE, \*\*\*SENTINEL, \*\*\*ASSASSIN GEAR ON BUYFALLOUT76LOOT.COM LIVE MARKET DISCORD = ABCDEFG" spam every few minutes
---
I found two in a fort defiance run, one was in a box and the other I looted from a ghoul
---
What hard work? Setting an area from inaccessible to accessible can be done in a single parameter change, nothing hard at all. Can literally be as simple as changing "False" to "True" on it. That isn't hard work. Likewise porting fallout 4 skins over to fo76 isn't hardwork either.
---
taaaake my hand
---
I tried this out and got the 1 cap per bullet my buddy bought. Then he bought 10 and i only received 9 caps. Seems to be paying me correctly.
---
PS4. Still debating on selling though, just wanted to see what a good price was. 👍🏻
---
Not a asshole. I did the same to the guy who put his c.a.m.p precariously on the edge of a cliff and shit around it so when you spawned at his camp you fell off the Godamn ledge to your death. But that’s cool because I orbited your Brahmin and crops and then led a SB to his camp to finish off what I couldn’t, it killed him too. Wouldn’t have done any of that had he not been a douche when I got in the mic and informed him of the problem of people trying to spawn and buy stuff and the squeaker decided to cuss me out and tell me he fucked my mom. Iv learned a lot of underage prepubescent kids have fucked my mom..weird
---
I need to inform you, that you can search if there is already information you are looking for, instead joining spam party.
---
And please, my father was snowflake. Derpinlurkins to moushimasu :)
---
I guess you have some privileged information to know that they aren't working hard, of course. You know everything that the employees are going through, no doubt.
---
I never said the game is perfect or without flaws. I have criticized this game when it needed to be criticized. But I'm also capable of doing the opposite.
---
What can I say, I'm a nice person!
---
I can see that your "training in mental health" (if that's what you want to call watching a couple of YT videos and consulting Wikipedia) wasn't really successful. That's a lot of failed assumptions right there. But don't worry, there's room to improve. A lot.
---
Agreed, works just fine for me as well.... either this guy is having an isolated bug or trolling us so we sell at 0....
---
Seems like you are at least not call out everyone "crying about it" like OP, so I will join the discussion.
---
You are right about this game is actually fallout 4 with multiplayer. And I do like Fallout 4.
---
The thing is, it has been 4 years. And after 4 years and Bethesda give us the kinda same game, isnt it laziness? After 4 years, give me essentially  the same game ( like you said ), charge us money, and still have bugs from fo4, and even more bug. Its recycle at its finest.
---
And fallout 3 and vegas did not have no where near amount of bug like FO76, like not even close.
---
And bug is just one thing. Its the combination of bugs, greed with microtransaction, fraud goods ..etc..that give customers bad taste.
---
Now I respect people who stay and play the game. It is your choice and its not the original point of the debate.
---
Its that we dont need to thank them at all, because this is the least they can do to redeem.
---
The thing I've really been surprised/pleased with is just how active my vendor stations have been.
---
I can't compete with people selling legendary equipment, I just don't have decent ones. 
---
But there's been room for me to sell booze/chems/aid/ammo/mats etc and while they are smaller purchases I have made more caps in the last few days than I generally have on my character. 
---
The limit of how many items for sale/still counting to stash weight was a turn off at first, but it helps guys like me who'd get less business because you have a bunch of guys with huge stock piles of everything.
---
Exactly! Not to mention what's garbage to you might be someone's dream weapon that you could make a good chunk of caps off of. I could rant on but i think we've made good enough points on this conversation lol.
---
Wow you really want to push this narrative huh? You've commented it a few times now when it's literally the opposite of the truth
---
yeah, people love to laugh at the rolling pin, but with the right perks, your pin can casue serious damage and would honestly be all you would need for anythign except the very strongest enemies.
---
Sorry, I didn't know you were a Bethesda employee and knew everything that's going on in the team.
---
Personally, I would love to see aluminum on the junk list as well. Also, I know some people are always hard up on springs.
---
Regardless, this is fantastic work, and i'm sure everyone is just as happy and grateful as I am.
---
"wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
---
They used to be more predictable before this patch. I always spawned in the same or very close to the same spot when I loaded in/fast traveled to my CAMP. Friends fast travelling to my CAMP would always spawn where I originally placed the CAMP box thing, no matter where I then moved it to after starting to build. I also could not build on the spot where folks would travel in. Now, I spawn in a random spot every time I go home and most people coming to shop spawn several yards from where my CAMP was originally placed. (I had taken special care when placing this particular CAMP to try and make sure I had good spawn points based on what I'd seen before.) Teammates also spawn in random spots. Thankfully no one's gotten stuck in a wall or foundation so far (that I've seen), but I've been close myself.
---
Skyrim with friends, which opened up multiplayer in skyrim, and a few mods to change issues I was running into myself, such as turning off the atom shop popping into the "social" button when you tried to click on it. a couple of CTD's and disconnected from servers.
---
what sorcery is dis you are under the weight limit? :O
---
TSE was the thing before its muzzle got nerfed.
---
Does any one know how to get the gatling laser
---
One of my friends got at least 3 in one day and we haven't done other challenges!
---
Server hopped for 3 hours tonight only found 3 deathclaws (lvl 21) which I couldn't tame and suspect a bug with the untagging of animal disallowing taming even with wasteland wanderer. [More detail  here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blra0h/fallout_76_wild_appalachia_patch_9_notes_may_7/en0mqav/?context=3)
---
Didn't find a single other animal to tame :( My previous yao guai died to a super mutant raid
---
Been trying cranberry glade, just south of spruce knob near the tower/junk pile and up at the pond above abbies bunker. Lots of packs of animals, Mr. Handy's, farming handys, 2 handys, prizebots and insult bots but no tames :( -- Anyone recommend me a spot?
---
Thank you, using power armor and heavy weapons sounds fun!
---
Is that the same for armor, ammo, plants, food, aid, weapons, holotapes and everything else?
---
I know enemies change spawns and so does the start of the camera quest (which I still havent got after approx 50 server jumps on different days)
---
You never know, my friend.
---
This post is an appreciation for the employees - nothing more and nothing less.
---
Its found in the Data tab of the "Quick-Boy".
---
this! happened to me 5 times yesterday!
---
Jumped up on it and squatted down :)
---
Thanks guys much appreciated!

YES.  Please I need to move mine.
---
The ultracite isn't a vein and there's no junk extractor locations mapped.
---
And the OP's question was.... ?
---
Good night.
---
The only one calling people names is you, you claimed I was a nerd, misgendered me, claimed my life sucks, ETC. It is obvious that you are the one here who is upset and mad. If you weren't you would be able to actually have a conversation about things instead of just repeating the same tired response every time.
---
Sold a bunch of 10mm and got the caps for them.
---
What’s wrong with it?  It’s been working fine for me.
---
Yea I have dropped or gave away 100s of random legendary items. I still have a shit load of random junk from the last month so I’m stoked on this addition. It is way different than what I thought it was going to be but that’s ok too. I’m just curious on the pricing so I’ve been trying get that 150 everyday!
---
People get pretty frustrated because this question gets asked multiple times a day here. The answer is yes though. If you've been following the progress, and watching some game play and it's appealing to you then yes you'll like it. The game starts pretty slowly, but once you acclamate it becomes quite fun and addictive.
---
Visitors' spawn point seems to be where firts placed your C.A.M.P. down. Rebuilding my base later to test for sure.
---
The quests are actually really fun and it's a lot different from other Fallout games. They added tons of items and weapons.
---
It's not that simple as middle of base. I spent a large very deal of time moving my CAMP machine all over the place and it always sucks spawn point to the far East or Northeast from it, which drives me insane because my entrance is on the West and can't be redesigned without rebuilding.
---
Camps seem to have two spawn points. Fast Traveling from far away and close by both put me at different spots to add annoyance to RNGing the spot by moving the machine.
---
If I put my CAMP Machine on furthest East spot, they spawn very very far East from my Camp with quite a run in store. If I put it anywhere on the north side or middle they spawn inside the lake NE of Camp. South border runs the risk of porting inside a non-camp wall to the Northeast of the CAMP Machine.
---
My only option is moving it around the West boarder till it picks a non cancerous position, which after hours of messing around with it was deemed impossible, so I had to just choose the least annoying one that doesn't hit water which is the very edge-center of my West border but at a very specific angle slightly Southeast from it....
---
Unfortunate the "fast travel from close by" port puts them awkwardly on top of a non-camp Metal Fence behind my building but at least they don't get stuck or infested by parasites.
---
It infuriates me that I can't just select a spawn point. I like my spot but the spawn point always annoyed me and I had to mess around with it more to keep random shoppers from dealing with it. My old spot's teleport from far away spot sucked but the close by one put me in front of my door. So every time I traveled to my Camp I'd load in, open my map, and teleport to my Camp again while already in it to reach my door... Other people can't do that in camps they don't own and of course wouldn't be familiar with the spot to know that ofc.
---
Haha especially after dropping that.  No, I actually was.  I made a vendor run just before this.
---
What are you even saying? OP's question was if the game is worth getting in its current state. The answer is not what you gave him, what you gave him is what your deluded brain has invented
---
Yeah, gotta be able to modify the amount without spending 10min per item lol
---
I had not considered the impact of stacking leadership bobbleheads. That explains the 500+ players I'd see wandering around a month in to the game.
---
To address your point #5, it's pretty common for people fast traveling in to bring mobs with them unintentionally.
---
Agreed on the rest though. Wear power armor if you're shop hopping lol.
---
How many hours do you have in?
---
Sounds very Vault-Tec to me.
---
Go north from the gnarled shallows following a stream that runs parallel to the edge of the world. It eventually comes to a pond where anglers spawn. Then the stream forks out of that, one goes to a pond with a crashed veritbird, the other is the tree house
---
Because I found her nuke launch audio tape after the one where she claims to be badly wounded.
---
The community isn’t toxic, we’re just tired of seeing these posts literally every 30 minutes on this sub when you could scroll down and find one.
---
Seems to be appearing often for me; not a great event anyway.  
---
It usually appears if I'm in the toxic valley area-ish.
---
I made a fort once...

Today i lost more than you could ever know
---
It may be isolated or only in certain circumstances, but I definitely haven’t been getting the caps. It shows the animation with the right totals, but my total bank doesn’t actually increase. I’ve talked to others with the same issue too.
---
So not rare or exotic at all then.
---
For me the fun isn't so much on visiting others. Its keeping a well stocked and visually pleasing shop. 
---
Im sure it will get old. However it is one extra thing to do regularly.
---
Yeah, I thought about going to survival and trying but I'm not built for PVP. Was just hoping for a little bit of good luck..lol.
---
Count me in 100% !  
---
Seeing communities starting to sprout up in-game is my long time dream, i've been trying to encourage people to band together whenever i can.  
---
We'll make Appalachia a place full of life!
---
Sincerely thank you so much for this.
---
fwiw..
---
I was being sarcastic because there are 10 of these threads a day...
---
PMing you my build, can't link here due to Fo76 subreddit rules. Happy to PM to anyone else interested as well. 600+ hour veteran that shreds through SBQ in 2-3 minutes.

I have a TS Dragon if you're on PC.  Name your price.

Never roll for 1* armor, never get wood armor though

Corn was unexpected, you can also use rotten vegetables.

If you are on PC my In-game name is Feiff. Come visit my pub,
---
I don't mind the atom shop for 2 reasons, 1) it funds the game going forward so there is none of that being locked out of new dlc because you didn't buy it.
---
the second reason is that you can earn atoms in the game, if you couldn't earn atoms then it would be a problem, but seeing as you can earn them, and quite a lot of them if you do all the challenges, then you don't really need to buy atoms. like I still have nearly 3000 atoms and i've bought things from the atom shop without spending any money on them.
---
i suppose there has to be some sort of a balance, the game has to make money at the end of the day and it doesn't have a subscription cost or dlcs that cost money. so they are relying entirely on ppl to buy cosmetics to keep the servers going and new content flowing.
---
1) yes, both. 2 unsure. 3 yes no problem, game doesn't care.
---
My advice is to start with what weapon you want to be your primary. Then go search Captainoob on YouTube and watch his weapon review. He shows you what perks help and what playstyle is the best in PvE.
---
that has always been false and has never been true you can get more capsand xp from turning in 2 but thats it nothing for turning in more than that at once.
---
Which platform are you playing on, and where did you play the instruments?
---
My wife and i had a random guy wave and down himself in water in front of us and i knew exactly what he was doing so i revived him and then downed myself so he could finish the challenge.
---
It's functionally identical to a vein. Yes there are. In cyan [here](https://i.imgur.com/SCKegzb.jpg)
---
They released the roadmap then delayed it. Every single lead has been moved to other projects. That’s all we know.
---
True.  My kid suggested toxic goo as well lol :0
---
Consider it done
---
BOS, the Enclave and the Institute could fucking try. I’ll kill em’ all. And just imagine every single fallout 76 player standing one place Good luck.
---
I would a map of plan and recipe spawns would be awesome need to find those raider armor plans somehow
---
heres a "challenge" u/AHeroicLlama: S'mores
---
1. Bone(no idea if this one is mapable)
---
2. Brahmin Milk(Brahmin :P)
---
3. Razorgrain Flour(Boiled Water\[imo i would label this one as water pump\], Concrete, Razorgrain)
---
4. Spices
---
5. Sugar(Snaptail Reed, Wood)
---
6. Wood(would be nice where you can find it in high concentrations eg. Gilman Lumber Mill)
---
if its better than what you have.. might as well use it till something better comes along...
---
Moving the machine affects where you arrive, but your guests always arrive where you first placed the camp machine. I noticed this when i made a house on a dock  in the river by the Nuka Cola Factory. I placed the machine on the boat out in the water to center it well, and all my friends who later fast traveled to me ended up on the boat, I myself spawned on land.
---
Are the screen shots cut off, or is two-shot really missing from ranged and weightless missing from armor?
---
&gt; I guess you have some privileged information to know that they aren't working hard, of course. You know everything that the employees are going through, no doubt.
---
When it is literally already coded and in the backend of the game and you can datamine it and clearly see it? Yeah, I do know for sure that it was already in the game and just set as inaccessible. That is kind of the point of datamining, to find the things that are hidden in the code.
---
 &gt;I never said the game is perfect or without flaws. I have criticized this game when it needed to be criticized. But I'm also capable of doing the opposite.
---
As am I when it is warranted, unfortunately it hasn't been warranted yet. You are making your assumptions on how much work they were doing without actually knowing they were doing anything. You have no proof they worked hard, meanwhile there is ample proof they weren't working hard at all and literally gated parts of the base game behind these "dlc" releases.
---
So literally I could use the same claim you did above about YOU not knowing what the devs are doing, whether or not they are working hard. The only difference is the actual physical evidence shows that they weren't.
---
&gt;I can see that your "training in mental health" (if that's what you want to call watching a couple of YT videos and consulting Wikipedia) wasn't really successful. That's a lot of failed assumptions right there. But don't worry, there's room to improve. A lot.
---
Ah, more assumptions. Graduated college with a minor in psychology with a specialization in abnormal psychology. Would you like to keep making more assumptions?
---
So like, a week ago?
---
This is a great idea for a shop, sort of like a last pit stop for supplies before you get to the SBQ. Make sure to sell plenty of meds, anti-rads, ammo, etc that players might need and you'll make a fortune.
---
I would like to second that squee.
---
Wait, how did you get it? Pipe revolvers do not exist in the drop table yet. That's why we are so happy to see them
---
There are several types so it's not the same. World features like ore and extractor points are always there.
---
When it comes to item spawn points (EG a plan). That location basically has a set amount of things it can do. It can spawn Plan A, Plan B, or it can spawn nothing (for example). So while the *spawn point* is always there - it doesn't necessarily mean you'll find anything there.
---
YES IT IS. 
---
I played it at the beginning and the bugs were too much for me. I took a break and kept waiting for news that it had improved. I’ve been playing for a couple of months now and I am having so much fun.
---
Oh Liberty Prime ***sigh*** how we miss thee
---
If you right click and use the view image option from a desktop browser you get a higher res image.
---
You don't need to be part of the team to know that these parts were already in the game. Datamining found them in the BETA. Has nothing to do with needing to know what the dev team is doing when the "dlc" is already in the game and has been datamined.
---
Sorry didn't give a full answer - afaik there is no differences at all between platforms. This was extracted from the PC copy however.
---
Huntersville, just south of the spawn point is a graveyard (left side of the road facing away from the town).  BoS graves there.  I've always found a wolf pack at that location.
---
I think its 100 scrip for a 3*
---

[I'll get back to you on that...](https://www.reddit.com/r/woosh)
---
Could I buy it off you
---
The way it was explained I actually thought it was going to be a re roll option. For whatever reason I was under that assumption the whole time so that was kind of a let down. But I’m still glad we have the option at all tbh. Otherwise I would of just vendored off everything for caps which I do not need. So at least we have something to do with that junk!
---
Imagine thinking you wooshed me when your comment was literally indistinguishable in every form from a whine post
---
Im not. I used to customize toys when I was young, but miss is just as inspiration strikes me.
---
For aluminum I'd recommend checking out the ore vein map for Aluminum ore, bringing along your excavator armor and a little acid and you'll have more than you need.
---
IGN: Anderssec selling plans, junk and ammo primarily
---
Damn bro, you're so alternative I wish I could be you
---
Just curious, do you have any mods installed?
---
It definitely registers! Also, don't fear for losing any treasured photos because while they won't be on your loading screen if you delete them, every photo you take is automatically stored on your hard drive. 
---
I've had to go delete 1.2 gig's of photos so far and I need to do it a 2nd time
---
In more step on our fight against communism!
---
but an extractor can't be put on an ultracite ore.
---
This is getting really fucking old. Just because someone else makes a completely valid point and disagrees with you doesn't mean they're sad? What's sad is watching you have no response to these comments besides presenting the same strawman over and over. Corporations are a reflection of the shitty consumers with your mentality.
---
Ghosts!
---
Oh shit that would be sick! I honestly can’t wait for this addition! I’ll have an ass load of scrip by Tuesday!
---
It’s “Haunted” but there is a terminal that controls the effect of you follow the wires up to a treehouse
---
Yes, but then also take a look at [this](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects) and notice how most third star affixes are useless. Personally I am going to concentrate on buying 2* items.
---
I know :( I haven't seen any shinies at stations lately. it's so sadly empty...but at least the light got fixed in watoga!
---
Love it!
---
I think it’s a metaphorical fork
---
Interesting... I'll have to get back to you then. I've seen the animation, but never actually checked my caps total before and after.
---
None
---
Oh for fucks sake, take a chill pill man.
---
I think it only registers when you actually snap a photo. Already existing photos in your gallery don't count
---
Another earthquake hit and all the doors closed.
---
I don't think they exist, I just added that skin on my excavator myself lol
---
I noticed something else that may have been overlooked dealing with Adrenal Reactions.
---
I was testing the calculator with a stock lvl 45 50 cal, added adrenal reactions, then started adjusting the percent life. Base damage of 43. I set health to 89%, which your table notes should result in a 6.25% increase in damage so the final result should be 45.6875 (rounded to 45.69). Instead the result is 45.58, which is exactly 6%.  I looked your code for it and you noted that it uses the values from the ESM table, which they round to the nearest percent and is different than the numbers you worked out.  So you might want to update your calculator to your numbers.  
---
And you have a comment in your code that "ESM indicates a super version, not sure where." As mentioned, this is the interaction of Adrenal Reactions with Strange in Numbers (which improves mutation positive effects by 25% in a group).
---
Interesting, I didn't realize Bloody Mess, Adrenaline, and Adrenal Reactions are additive. I can see the logic behind FO76 making the last two additive (since they're kinda the same thing), but Bloody Mess doesn't really have a relation to the other two.
---
You can inspect, but only if the owner of the camp is close nearby. 
---
Which sortof defeats the purpose.
---
Happens to me too, I find it hilarious actually
---
100 stims, 300 diluted. Bulk adhesive, aluminium and springs, radaway and hazmat suits. I think I have them covered. I will start making ammo soon but need some perks. Pure melee build thusfar lol. but two points in ammosmith will be worth a punt.
---
Haha. I was search for those nuclear winter holotapes and happen to walk by the area. Shit unsettles me.
---
Legendary PA were datamined back in beta, but never added. It's likely they're a holdover from Fallout 4, and I will be pleasantly surprised if they ever get added to the game.
---
I bet under 40 hours. That seems to be the line where people stop having the blinders on and stop having the ability to ignore the glaring issues.
---
I want a bloodied explosive shovel!
---
Thanks for the clarification. Odd that it's different for you and them. This actually works in my favor, as the original spot is better than where I spawn in now.
---
Usually the ones I see that are  "mobile" use a 1x2 foundation, stairs up then. Build the rest up there since the 2x1 or 1x2 foundation can be placed almost anywhere. Only limit is trees etc that wont let the upper part exist in same space
---
Check out inside those cabins
---
Good to know! Thanks!
---
what would you call the ultracite spawns then? They look like every other ore vein, and are mined the same way.  
---
Perhaps you are mistaking deposits for veins?
---
Fair point regarding the fungi. To be honest, they are more example maps, I'm still happy to produce specific maps of a set collection of plants that anyone may want.
---
I think I may try maps for each Flux color first and just see how they come out.
---
Got it!
---
My camp is up there, never gotten it. Only curious as maybe they added mounted plans to it
---
I don’t get how people haven’t figured that out yet! I’ve had this happen to me like 5 times and I just have to leave because I don’t want the bounty.
---
Are you just looking inside? All the ones I’ve seen have been outside the station on the side the train would stop if it’s picking up passengers. If not I’m not too sure
---
You mean the one you get from the computer in the hunting lodge in the Toxic Valley? It's been a while but if you talk to the computer again you should get the quest. Did it a few times that way.
---
Nuclear winter holotapes? I must of missed something 🤣
---
It sure is. It's about the only time beserkers is worth a damn.
---
There's also bits of story spread around the cabins. Holos of people reporting the apparent haunting, the guest book that gets progressively creepy, etc.
---
They’ve taken up to 30 seconds to appear for me. Slow loading.
---
What's your point? Ore *veins* and ore *deposits* are distinctly different things.
---
Amen
---
Need to find one on Xbox :( lol
---
T-51b for most of it and x01 helm for the recon mod
---
Condition will deteriorate a lot slower too.
---
PS4. I built and played the instruements at my camp. I played either guitar or piano at the Rusty Pick and Watoga HighSchool (I go for acoustic first, then piano when I play an instrument)
---
No instrument was played for more than 3 seconds. 
---
No instrument at the Nukashine seems to work for me, played them all multiple times a, briefly and all the way to feeling tuned.
---
You can't suddenly start being a real person and then tell me to take a chill pill lol, grow up
---
I learned all the plans for it, so now whenever I find a level 50 one I mod it out and sell it in my machine for like 200 caps. They sell surprisingly well considering how useless they are
---
If I'm reading the ESM correctly, the Pipe Bolt Action with the right grips should stack rifle &amp; pistol perks, but the Pipe Rifle won't. Did you check both?
---
PSN Alluminati1ftw - mostly plans and rare junk priced well
---
I’ll be on around 12:30 and need to do the same thing. PSN D-Wall317
---
As someone who hasn't touched it in ages since quitting can someone give me a summary of updates that have made the game a lot more enjoyable / or what content has been added that is worthwhile?
---
Might give the game another chance then.
---
Oh wow thats awesome thanks for the tip :)!
---
OP is really in denial and came here for self-assurance and didn't get it.  Just look at his tendencies in these comments. Only a person this out of their fucking mind would think like this.
---
Yeah, it's not perfect, but it's a decent community of users.
---
Go south and follow the road from big Al's tattoo parlor in morgan town. You should see a black and red box with a holotape in it.
---
I addicted to it too!!!
---
Hiding behind Phoenix the vendor bot while I get my Grognak fix in.  I keep loading up Grognak with every buff possible, that 3 swing attack is a beast.
---
added the gamertag :) Will try rotating it because it's position seems to make no difference.
---
I'm celebrating reaching level 190s, this game has had its ups and downs in its short life but I hope it will continue the steady growth and improvement. Bethesda having hitting (in my opinion) and home run with this recent content and I've been having a great fun.
---
Definately worth buying or picking up again, nothing to lose, can be picked up now for so little.
---
I get annoyed reading these posts all the time. However it is nice to see renewed interest in the game. Good job Bethesda!
---
"No new content"?? They've added the nukashine daily quests, the burrows, the legendary scrapper, pioneer scouts. All within maybe 2 months. Bugs and lag are fo76's biggest problem. The community seems to have stayed about the same and even grown a bit since the months after launch.
---
I agree that $60 for this game is a bit pricey but theres plenty of sales. I unfortunately payed the full price for the preorder but I like the game and have spent lots of time playing it. But it has made me think more before buying preorders.
---
Damn these wasteland mutations! Soon we'll be finding Mole Rats will their own pipe guns!
---
Thanks, I'm also on PS4 but haven't got any of them to work. I'll try scrapping my old instruments and play the new ones.
---
If on xbox I'll pay 1.5k
---
It save automatically and ask if you want to continue on start up
---
Very well put sir.
---
1. Errr Bone is best found from mobs which unfortunately I can't map yet.
---
2. Same issue.
---
3,4,5,6: This can definitely be done! (I will omit water because it's easier to pick up from streams) I had omitted wood originally since it's just sooo common, but it can be done if you'd like?

I built a piano, snare drum, and tuba at my camp an none completed on the badge tasks but playing the bass at my camp did. Tried the nukashine instruments but nothing
---
This guy commerces.
---
AND PASS...
---
you did the similar thing last time too right? I love your work!
---
There's a quest marker to go talk to him and once you get that it says you've completed that singular objective then says 'rid dolly sods of pests' or something along those lines.
---
But what you're actually meant to do is the new daily quest you just received from that guy which is listed as a whole different quest. Me being a guy with not much time to play decided to focus the main scouts quest and do dailys another time. Not realising due to what feels like slightly unclear way of displaying the quest, that the whole other daily quest was part of that original quest.
---
Not a gap I guess just a bit misleading
---
i think they will adjust it again.. i wouldnt sweat it...
---
I actually thought it was even brighter.
---
There is never enough stash space
---
freddy fear might know
---
Can anyone tell me where this magazine spawns?
---
Irony is only irony when seen in context, use the OPs question and the hundreds of similar as a contextual starting point.
---
But she and her 1200 gauntlet-wielding cousins will attack you as soon as you leave her 😂
---
In my expierience they spawn on the body of a dead women dressed as a witch, located at the little Red Rocket at Valley Galleria. I havn't always seen the body there though, so it could require server hopping?
---
The witch hat can be found at the pumpkin house.
---
Alas, I have not run across the plan for the rest of the outfit....
---
well done.. congrats..!
---
You realize this is a standard practice in gaming right?
---
The only difference is other games make you pay for that DLC....
---
Please stop talking like you're a higher form of existence, really cringy
---
I play this game alot and like it but it never should have been released when it was and  probably around the end of this year is when the game should have come out.
---
I'm grown...
---
Off to play some FO76, bye :)
---
They won't..but u can have up to 5 characters
---
true but its got that horrible fish eye depth to it, the new free terminal screen is flat (tho pushed back) which is usually how arcade machine screens are, hence why i couldn't wait to load up my Zeta Invaders while my vending machines did their job only to find i couldn't slot in a holotape :(

Me too, and it always seems to happen when I'm being blasted by a minigun or a Gutsy.
---
Look in the mirror son!
---
He’s. Get it.  Add me if you need anything. Psn overurhead360
---
Yeah, at this point I just want to see how much more he will ignore. I wonder how sad of a person you would have to be to have such a emotional reaction to someone saying a game is a buggy mess. It is down right weird and kind of sad honestly. The dude literally has such low self esteem he can't even handle people criticizing a game he plays.
---
Like how fucked in the head do you have to be to not realize this game is a buggy fucking mess and bethesda did and is doing some very shitty and shady things with this game. It is like he takes it personally and can't accept reality. Bethesda isn't your friend, they are a multimillion dollar company that only cares about one thing, making money, that's it.
---
I'll be sure to keep you guys updated. Wont be for a while, I'm not doing a daily post with this like I did my last one.
---
Links?
---
Is it possible to make a map of animal spawn locations? Primarily neutral animals. I ask because my house is located by 2 high frequency opossum spawns, also it would be helpful for several of the daily missions.

bethesda couldve sent out literal feces instead of fo76 copies and people would still buy tes6

back in my day you would lag if you left the forest, barely able to do anything in watoga or the mire and one shot builds were something people thought were urban legends
---
Yah I enjoyed it a lot, and didn't want to lose my touch with the pen so decided a weekly page would be something I could swing with all my other work going on.
---
I'm with you on this. The legendary vendor is already eliminating a lot of the RNG when it comes to legendaries.
---
\-Guaranteed to whatever star level you choose
---
\-Guaranteed item type of your choosing
---
So OP.....quit whining.
---
Why do you even post here?
---
Do you even play 76 still?
---
Or did you replace it with the hobby of bad mouthing 76/any opinion here that isn't critical of the game?
---
Oddly enough, the photos seem to register more often if you take the picture of the dead carcass rather than the living creature. No idea why but that’s been my experience the last few days.
---
Yea but you make sure someone gets it. That’s always my thing, I want to get rid of it but I know SOMEONE (in theory) could use it so I could see how someone would do this.
---
I was joking, just making a comment that being so far from the truth I thought people would realise I was being ironic, a jibe at this question being asked over and over again.
---
I love the game, I bought it for £16 UK a total bargain.
---
Sorry I'm on ps4 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  
---
Also your parents have a nice taste in names
---
You can google skyrim with friends, I haven't publicly released the other mods and I don't plan on it. With skyrim with friends, the group is big enough and had enough women in it to not get doxxed by sharing that. 
---
Outside of that I'm not going to help my stalkers dox me. Sorry, I already got enough nutters from Shitredditsays trying to doxx me I don't need to help them or other nutters
---
Having multiple accounts and being able to run 2x accounts at the same time to facilitate muling opens up a whole new world to you as far as muling / trading / many other things goes. I run 2 accounts, and I'm on the verge of maxing both accounts out on caps (currently at 200K, 250K should happen soon). I've focused more on hoarding lots of flux / junk / things I need for crafting ultracite ammo (currently have 150K .50 Cal Ultracite Ammo for my primary weapon) than making caps though. Caps were always just a means to an end, never the goal itself.
---
I have the weird obsession where I just cant let go,  like I need to try it, just not at full price if the game is a "flop".  
---
I still want No mans sky.  Yet they still want $60 for it,  2+ years later...   
---
Its weird I know...
---
and homebody, that health regen has slowed my death several times
---
Happened to me but with less items, had a full vending machine, hopped world's and items were no longer listed. I had to list them all over again.
---
so I was wondering if this would be a way to obtain legendary scout armor and it appears that it might be.  They also need to make sure that the items roll properly people me included are going to get mad rolling for a 3 star and get a non legendary shovel.
---
I agree but i dont see a filter option
---
I went to vending camps last night for the first time. I spawn within the structure of the camps so I run out while the camp is loading lol usually ran into enemies. I picked up a fusion core for 100 caps! I saw at another camp they wanted 346 caps for a fusion core? I was also looking through a vending machine when I fell to the ground? the camp disappeared! it would be nice to know or have a timer saying this camp will disappear in 10 seconds or something lol.
---
All in all I'm digging this new vending feature. The items that are for sale are really cool and the camps are amazingly built!
---
Oh jesus, I remember when that happened to me, always just zippingg back to see what I could dump or stash to not be overencumbered, but then I started re-using ecavator and that escalated to having to buy shocks, then that escalated to having to use a glitch that increases carry weight by a unintended 100lbs but that's taken away if I step out, but after a while of more hoarding and then being perma encumbered for now, I just learnt to embrace it, and have a refreshing Nuka Cola Quantum before my AP bar runs out #NotAnAd
---
Well stop being a twat and staying stupid shit and maybe people won't call you out on your bullshit.
---
That’s just given to you automatically when you launch a nuke. It’s just as possible to launch a nuke then find her final holotape. That being said it’s pretty open ended - not sure what happened to her
---
But you do blame Mcdonalds when one of the CEO's does something shitty, so when bethesda's parent company pulls shit like that, it shows a major problem going from the top down in that companies hierachry.
---
It indeed is! I've always gotten rid of mine but this might make it worth keeping
---
not sure where he got this from
---
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go put on my clown outfit and kill a wendigo at Whitesprings with one foot in the pool while another player holds a machete as we stand on each other shoulders while shooting a scorchbeast.  For 10 Atoms.
---
Right ?
---
Not to mention that when a company is pushing you to get a product out as fast as possible.....
---
It doesn't mean the people working on that game don't care about it. It's not like some graphic designer stood up and said "Fuck boys, we need to make some money on this asap, slap the rest together and shove it out the door"
---
😂🤣😂🤣
---
Inspect only works if the camp owner is within range, otherwise its a crap shoot
---
Did u lose everything?
---
The content drops have been great.  
---
I also think they have reached the point where they have proven that this platform can deliver content at a sustainable rate.  I think some of us had doubts.
---
Where’s your camp at that it spawns legendaries like that if you don’t mind tell by me?
---
FWIW - TSE does less damage than a 1 star Bloodied, assuming you are comfortable running a bloodied build.
---
I put all my stuff in Overseer's stash, at her camp or in flatwoods church.  Pretty much the exact same thing, but I don't have to wait for people to take my garbage.
---
It’s not “sucking them off” it’s not “shilling” or being a “bethstard” or “blind fanboy” it’s giving credit when it’s due and there is nothing bad about that people for some reason only think criticism means bashing and being negative and pointing out flaws it actually goes BOTH WAYS you can praise something and point out it’s flaws it does not have to be one way or the other.
---
Any way to extract a map of random encounter locations? I've figured out a bunch and have a mental image of the ley lines of weirdness they follow, but I'm sure I'm missing most of them.
---
GO DO A SEARCH!!!!
---
welp, thats pretty shitty. rip the dream of buying an explosive weapon from someones machine
---
I bathe in a radioactive lake all the time, plus it's got electrolytes
---
No it isn't. Did you forget the MASSIVE backlash games have gotten for day 1 DLC? That is literally the same thing as this, only they didn't give it away day 1, they waited so they could claim they were giving out the DLC later.
---
It isn't DLC when it is literally part of the base game, that is just being shitty locking parts of the base game back so you can give it out for free later. When it shouldn't have been locked in the first place.
---
It's that kinda of encounter that makes me really dig this community.
---
I bought a mod from someone's store for relatively cheap. Check around people seem to have everything
---
That's **still** after 360 hours...
---
There's no embracing for me, lol
---
Personally I think the patches have been all glory no guff, since multiple issues persist. Food spoils too quickly, but we aren't going to mention it, ps4 load times are absolutely atrocious and it can take up to 2 minutes for your base / whitesprings to fully load, but let's ignore that.Last night I went into white springs, couldn't interact with anything for a full two and a half minutes, then teleported to the entrance with every robot attacking me. 
---
Not even counting the other issues, adding. Legendary vendor and cameras are nice, but don't solve the substantial issues present, and they don't care to change them until it can be used to turn around something fucking up. It's bitter and pessimistic but it's a very common live service strategy
---
Exit light
---
Hoping patch 9.5 addresses that.
---
If you're going to joke on reddit use "/s" after the joke. It's hard to translate sarcasm on the internet so let people so its satirical.
---
don't. You'll get eaten by a Grue.
---
THE MARGARITAS!
---
^(No wait.....)
---
I think it might show up as miscellaneous? But I'm not sure on that.
---
They weren't calling me out on any bullshit, they hate me because I'm a woman that won't join their cult of feminism and hate straight white males with them.
---
But what if they bought 1, then 1, then 1, then 1, then 1, 9 times?
---
lol let's hope we all laugh loud and hard when the purveyor gives us what we want
---
Is the Earth flat or round ?nobody knows except the Flat Earth Society 
---
Is the cup half full or half empty? Just refill it if you want a good tip.
---
Global warming fact or fiction? Depends did we keep accurate records for the last 10,000 years that show a precise rise in temperature since the industrial revolution or have there always been variations.
---
Is this game worth getting? Just wait at Game Stop and ask the 12 year old trading this game in on his or her opinion.
---
It works well on my IPhone 5s, just install the App and click on the image once its loaded and you will get it in high resolution. Then you zoom on the area you want.
---
Yes I play it daily, that doesn't mean you can't point out issues it has. Honestly if I didn't play it then I wouldn't give a shit about the issues.
---
Todd would be a cyborg with a skyrim port
---
Fuck Bethesda for this crazy list. It NEEDS sub categories like heavy ,2 hand,arm, leg.
---
You would think they would at least remove the garbage like shovels
---
Repair kits have changed nothing really, I've not used them, no need. The game is great and getting better, take a leap of faith and dive back in :)
---
Same thing happened to me. Thankfully I didn't have too much, but still annoying nonetheless
---
I want them in the pool, just not at the vendor
---
This dumbass got stuck on me once because he went over fire, essentially draining his health to zero.. He just kept going up and down and up and down like the idiot he is
---
You have the highest level of upgrades weps and arms
---
I think bloodied explosive melee weapons would be hilarious
---
i just hope its not a game limitation thing. like where the gun cant be loaded if the owner is far away.
---
Spacesuit maybe
---
Sucks you might have to find a less popular spot may I suggest Fissure site prime.
---
The leader boards are just dumb.  They just need to make an arena where people can pvp. I've heard complaints from the guys who like pvp basically saying they can't find anyone to fight.
---
Can i interest you in a 25k piece of perfectly preserved pie?
---
No thankfully!
---
My buddy bought 1 a couple of times and it paid me 1 cap each,  we didn't test it out further then a few 1s then he did 10 and i got 9 seems to be correct at least for me. Initially i thought the same how could they take 10% from 1 cap and i don't think they can .
---
Well that explains why the vendors are alway, at least mostly in the CAMP when I visit. I thought they were harvesting my hearts and thumbs up :D
---
We've had a thread every day once a week, and everytime it's reached the top of the board. What did they respond to, though? Changes or tweaks they had planned or would take two seconds but give positive feedback. They literally ignored everyone screaming about repair kits, not to mention. Ladydeva accidentally went on a responding spree to random things and didn't say a fucking peep to anyone asking about repair kits DURING that time. 
---
And look what happened. People stopped complaining. Because if they just ignore it people will give up. And so far they've ignored asking for a clear change for the better for some obtuse reason (most likely they have something planned for when the games server pop dies even further so they can go LOOK BIG UPDATE WE FIXED THE ISSUE and try to fish people back in.)
---
Hello, friends!

PC: Ember33

Selling weapons, armor, clothing, plans, some junk, Bobbleheads, and magazines :)
---
"Fist"
---
I got a bowie knife skin, and no glowing wendigo while solo. I got the 3 waves of bugs.
---
Just little correction. Event name is ... Event: campfire tales.
---
Same here. There is SO much shit to do! You literally can’t do everything. This last update was epic! There is so much more to this game past the quest. Now that I think of it, the quest is only a small part of the game all around. I play a couple hours everyday and I love it.
---
Okay sounds good, for the Archery there's a bow or crossbow provided?
---
I play with a fan on, and you can hear it over my voice. I use discord because you cant hear the fan. I dont use text in any other game except to give out discord to those I play with. in a lot of MMO games with random groups I dont even type.  Once in a dungeon only typing is to use skills and move
---
I would like elevators, but better ones. The elevators from FO4 never worked right. Although I don't want to think about how much build budget those things would take up in this game.
---
I'm level 195, last time I looked months ago it was over 250. It's probably over 400 now.
---
Okay I’m glad I’m not the only one.  Did anyone’s happen when their CAMP couldn’t be placed or just happened?
---
Maybe they're bitter? Have you been using fresh fertilizer?
---
Side note, turning those into tea first nets you waaaay more exp than you'd think.
---
Nope, I'm an idiot, and substituted revolver with pistol.
---
Apologies for getting anyone's hopes up.
---
Don't see the point of anyone wasting their time buying 1 at a time unless they are trolling you and even then thats just stupid an a waste of time
---
True, I forgot about that
---
I got stuck inside someone's concrete wall yesterday, it was super annoying. Luckily I got out by exiting my power armor.
---
Had this in ghost stories and only had a crossbow on me besides my axe.. It was a bloodbath daryl would be proud of.
---
Guys please stop it. This is mean
---
Side note: Aaronholdt Farm in the northwest corner of the map has almost every farm-type food item growing, including normal cranberries in excess c:
---
Hope this helps
---
Hey Man, I bought the game code for only £16 last November, I'll bet you can find a sweet deal on the code if you search about a bit. Definatley worth it.
---
Good luck!
---
Nice work.... Now I want Faction flags for my camp.
---
This is what happens when you use a frankensteined single player engine to make a multiplayer game
---
No I just tried the pipe bolt action but with the explosive trait .. it's on a character I don't really use anymore but at the time I was stackin the perks, when I logged into it I removed a pistol perk checked damage and nothing changed, re-added the perk and no damage increase so I just assumed it was fixed and went back to my normal char
---
Costume plans used to spawn on dead trick-or-treaters at various random spawn points. The same ones that Mr. Squeeze shows up on. I haven’t seen the the trick-or-treater in a few patches, though.
---
Yea that’s true but generally speaking everything I get is max level and would be useless to people in flatwoods. I do (or at least did) drop my extra plans at the overseers camp. Now I put them in my machine for 50 caps and they sell pretty good. Honestly plans and serums are by far the best sellers for me!
---
The point wasn't that it should or would be done, but to test how it calculates and rounds the taxes charged on the purchases.
---
I do wish there was. I have all rare apparel and only one piece of armor listed, but I put on that vending machine "Clothing" hoping that when people see it they're not too disappointed to only see outfits and not a crap ton of armor!
---
Good looking out on this. Thank you. Didn't realize I had the wrong Royal Jelly and Sugar Bombs.
---
The plans are at the range but most likely they will be gone. Just YouTube where crossbows spawn and go get one. That’s what I did
---
I've heard this and I want to do it but have 1 STR.
---
So, it’s a 0.00156848 percent chance to find the ranged item I want?
---
Cool, I’ll grab it in a few years!
---
That’s if it is all completely uniform and the items are all max level.
---
Thank You! It was a bit of a pain doing some of the tasks, but if you keep at it you succeed, in the end.
---
Wow this is incredible work. Love the detail.
---
The course at the ski slope is awesome! Lol
---
I think the search function on Reddit is not very powerful, may be the reason, IDK
---
Agree. There is no way to beat this game. And if they refuse to play with people in a multiplayer game it’s going to lack something.
---
Swing Speed and Faster fire are also highly desireable
---
Alright, I’ll try it as I was intending on getting a refrigerating mod to begin with, but heads up, ER and RR don’t affect Berserker’s. Only DR.
---
Art reflects life.
---
Lol every game is dead until the developer changes all their hard work and ruins the game lol fallout 76 looked good to me and it is. No one knew about the glitches pre launch so it was all just whining but I do agree with some of the CONSTRUCTIVE criticism about the glitches.
---
They are probably level scaled to your character. And the rates seem to be the same for each item and effect.
---
It does not
---
I had a speakeasy under my camp, in the mountain,  for a while...bar (tables as it was before the bar came out), tables with chairs, crafting tables for alcohol, musical instruments, signs &amp; lights...the whole shabang.  It was fun for a little while, but then when I wanted to add onto my base I removed it all for the budget space.
---
Xbox VGC Izzy13 selling chems, drinks, plans, recipes, and bulk materials
---
Yes yes it is
---
Here before the massive negative comments 
---
Game is great btw. Try it
---
Thats great to hear
---
Was it released with the base game? 
---
Then it's literally not literally part of the base game. 
---
You're expecting companies running online services like 76 to not launch with planned/partially prepared DLC? 
---
Did you want to wait 6 months for the first DLC to roll out because it had to be built from scratch while patches and bug fixes we're also going on. 
---
If Bethesda would have launched Fallout 76 without future content already being worked on/planned/ready to be tweaked for implemention I'd have called that poor planning.
---
There's a guaranteed spawn of it in the last area in the kidnapped kid quest, the one you get at Wavy Willards Waterpark. I dont remember if it's the magazine or the holotape but same difference.
---
My camp seems to get a good amount of action too. I filled it up with 120 items and have something of nearly every type so people who hover over will know they at least get a decent selction to make the fast travel worthwhile. So even if your legendaires aren't the best, if you aren't gonna scrip them, sell them realtivly cheap and someone might spend the caps to get the scrip for themselves.
---
Most of my prices end in 69 too.niiiiccceeee
---
I love the shiny silver, but yeah I would kill for some gold plated stuff!
---
Thank you, going look now
---
I’d be happy to help if you were to make this an open source web app hosted on Github or something.
---
We are doing that too...just after we get your caps.
---
Fast travel.....the true cap sink of vending.
---
I'm fine, I don't take anything these bootlickers say with any validity. Most of them are children who are mad they blew their allowence on this game and are stuck with it. So they feel anyone who is critical of the game must also be attacking them.
---
He is just a joke at this point, and I'm having a good laugh drawing out his stupid replies that show he has no good argument and has to rely on "your mad" like that is some sort of valid response. LOL
---
Haha great picture!
---
I'd be down with having to manually collect your caps from the machine, there would be more reasons to go to your own camp
---
Will your T.O.W.N.S. have guards? Asking for a friend...
---
Damn it! Well goodluck with getting a god roll at the purveyor
---
XD
---
Heh well it's different for everyone!
---
And lel I'm sitting on  a good 500-600 hours on my part
---
Yea, so a 0.00156848 percent chance to find the item you want.
---
(Ranged weapon)
---
Maybe you’ll find what you want next year!
---
If you could pick the item and roll the effects, it would be a 0.06 percent chance to find the item you want, which would be Mythic Rare by most MMO standards.
---
I figured as much.  Thank you, at least it sounds like I can play it on my own console after playing on another console without screwing up my screenshots.
---
It works well on mobile, they have to download the Imgur app and open the image in it, once the image opens, they click or double click so it views as a photo/image then the image is in high quality mode and very clear, zoom to where they want and its that easy. I did it on an old IPhone 5S and its amazing quality. Thanks for all your hard work, will make it easier to find all the missing plants/junk and other hard to find items.😊
---
Never even thought about selling legendaries cheap for scrip. 
---
Well player vending and scrip launching so close together worked out
---
Sad part is all of the people that will undoubtedly defend backpacks not working with power armor because so many folks have a blind hatred for power armor.
---
But the issue is the fridge backpack. The fridge apparently doesn't stack with Good with Salt; but essentially frees up perk points if you usually run Good with Salt. So that's a major functionality advantage.
---
You have a very good point there, I'm not very good at clever banter on social media. I'll definatley remember to include the appropriate /x after my comment in the future.
---
Thanks a lot for the tip. 
---
It's definitely an age thing, I'm too old to have learnt the subtleties of texting etc.
---
Thx for that post, but im too late ;)
---
You've now just normalized what Bethesda is doing. Theres lots of people out there doing really shitty things, you're not supposed to be supporting them in doing shitty things.
---
You're now part of the group of people who've taken a step back and given these companies yet another inch. Anymore inches and they'll take the field.
---
Just to clarify, the solo/group does not dictate which encounter you get. It's either the waves of bugs of the wendigo
---
I was wondering about that, I had only ever gotten the Wendigo while solo.
---
Idk but this quest is a pain.
---
Trying to get a camera to do the tadpole badge bs
---
Yep, I felt like an idiot that I couldn't find them. They did not explain this at all. Had to ask someone in game. It's in the same place where you see your daily challenges. Just pick world instead of daily and scroll to the bottom of the uncompleted ones. And if you don't know where daily challenges are, open your map and then pull up the menu. Challenges should be one of the menu options. It's in there.
---
This is my #1 request. I think I'm going to have to look into it, despite my initial hesitations
---
Wait I don’t think you can trade or drop back packs right? So how can you give it to someone to borrow?
---
Ive also noticed a significant delay in the load in time for the machines.
---
&gt; Was it released with the base game? 
---
All the files were already in the game prior to launch, they were in the game in the BETA.
---
&gt;You're expecting companies running online services like 76 to not launch with planned/partially prepared DLC? 
---
There is a difference between partially prepared DLC and just locking part of the base game from being accessed so they can release it a few months down the line and claim it is part of the "free DLC" they promised.
---
I mean hell, literally every "DLC" they have released so far has already been in the game in their entirety outside of the logs for the upcoming DLC. That will be the first DLC they actually added anything into the game for.
---
&gt;Did you want to wait 6 months for the first DLC to roll out because it had to be built from scratch while patches and bug fixes we're also going on. 
---
Yes, I'd much rather wait months down the line for real DLC and not have parts of the game removed so they can "give" it to me months later. 
---
&gt;If Bethesda would have launched Fallout 76 without future content already being worked on/planned/ready to be tweaked for implemention I'd have called that poor planning.
---
There is a big difference between planned DLC and locking out players from completed parts of the base game just so they can call it DLC later.
---
It takes a while to load just like the train station vendors
---
Cool. This number is with those factors in mind.
---
The chance is that low.
---
2. 27 percent chance to get any particular ranged weapon you want.
---
I hate to step in on this and be rude, but I would also offer caps/bait to hold your magic piece of paper for 2 minutes c:
---
That's even more annoying because every other ingredient doesn't auto-scrap.
---
Workshops have a larger budget and more room than camps. You could always take over tyler county dirt track, it's already an arena. Just blueprint it in sections and you can rebuild it whenever you want.
---
I feel that right now most purchases are speculators. Buying low and trying to resell. I have my items priced my useful effect 1\*s at 1-3k depending on weapon (rarer drop weapons or in demand priced higher) and haven't sold a thing.
---
If you have a buddy there's an easy workaround. Build the new personal terminal and give it a level 1 lock. Buddy cracks it 3 times. Repeat with level 2 and 3 locks.
---
Go to buddies house and he does the same for you. Bam! Challenge completed without running all over the map or server hopping terminals.
---
Imo they are better for new players and not ppl like myself.
---
I came back and saw them and lost motivation instantly.  Especially just for a backpack i don't need and fluff
---
I will check my alt when I get home I have a full stash of Legendary weapons I was saving for the Purveyor.
---
I agree with everything you said in your second paragraph. I do play this game but I've promised myself I'm not spending anymore real money after the whole repair kit thing and nerfing the durability of guns/armour. I’ve completely lost respect for the corporate decisions Bethesda has made. They realize a train wreck and put it on the customer to compensate for the low sales financially, which are the lowest of all recent FO games and 1/4th of F04 based on some data I saw just last night. Then they’re presenting it like an effort to make this game even better. This is not on the developers who probably did the absolute best they could and did great things. It’s on the management personal or whoever is responsible for this. 
---
As far as the OP goes I actually feel bad and I’m just going to ignore him going forward. Who am I to rain on his parade, his delusional parade.
---
This. As soon as the loading screen drops I start spamming jump and run.
---
When you look at it make sure it pops up in the top right of your camera then take the pic or it wont register.
---
That’s awesome. I have one character over level 100 and a second level 31. Two completely different builds and two completely different play throughs. The lower level I’m not doing any quests with the exception on daily quests until I reach level 50.
---
I’m sure there would be plenty of contributors to the project if it were open source, and you could still be the lead and whatnot. Anyway, an offer of help is definitely there from me. I’m a professional dev so Python, PHP, and JS are my gravy, and I have played with C# in the past.
---
I made 3badges by doing challenges and 13 badges by doing event. Never any more!!!!!
---
Reality: Spawn at their camp inside their chemistry bench. Spawn at nearest map point. Run over.
---
Or because you make outrageous claims without evidence or consistency. 
---
So, did YOU make Skyrim with friends or were you part of a TEAM that did?
---
Out up or shut up.
---
Yeah. You know: The good old days.
---
You didn't get any tidbits on the future of legacy weapons in your digging, did you?
---
Such as the phrase permanently removed or temporarily removed?
---
I almost made a similar post until I used the search bar for "returning". Unfortunately you're right, most posts now are down-voted into oblivion and are given no actual answers. It's kind of a bummer to get turned away from the community so hard when all we want is to come back and join in on the fun. I understand the posts get annoying, but it doesn't hurt to just ignore them or let the mods deal with them.
---
Like character build blueprints? That would be cool only issue I forsee is if a build requires different special stats cause even if they mad this a thing you would still only be able to move perk points when u level up. Of course if ur the kinda person who has who has 10 20 30 un used level ups then maybe just start another charcter
---
Working as intended.
---
they added it in the patch notes later lol what a joke. They can’t even get the patch notes correct.
---
The arena idea could work.  Maybe if they just expanded the markers to show the Top 10 and based it off kills that could help things.  Also, don’t have it reset when you die.  If you’ve killed 15 players and die you are still actively PvPing.
---
Make sure it’s the actual crocodile and not the signs
---
I am not sure if I am sold on the TS Dragon, I have an Instagating Dragon and man if they are at full health it seems to do way more damage than the TS
---
If you loved settlement building specifically from fallout 4 you might enjoy this one. If you want that plus a sort of looter-survival game mixed in, this game is certainly up your alley.
---
Not rude at all, I'll try to get to everyone once I'm on
---
A bloodied explosive lead pipe is likely for one-time use only, as a suicide weapon lol
---
Depends on what you loved about Fallout 4
---
I worked on it and helped create it, Yes. Nowhere did I claim I made it on my own. You going to try to claim that you aren't actually making mods unless you do it by yourself? LOL
---
Yes you would. It’s a great game, with a few minor bugs, and 90% of the people you meet online are incredibly friendly. 
---
It also helps that there is new updates coming and all DLC is free.
---
As I said no matter what the angle it doesn't register.
---
Yeah, and some developers have absolutely no trouble doing just that. Like I said, Division 2 just came out. No issues conforming to all the requirements. It's..."small indie developers" like Bethesda and EA that seem to have trouble with this.
---
While I would love that, the current cap / stash max limits vending a lot. I want to be able to play my main while selling stuff but I can't do that if I can only sell items off of a mule.
---
I still don't have my bag.
---
It'll fit like a glove if you liked 4. The lack of traditional NPCs is a bit jarring at first, but you get used to it fairly quickly. It also feels way less lonely after the last patch.
---
Tbf they never had a chance.  They peaked with SOCOM 2 and everything afterwards could never live up to the hype or expectation.
---
The problem with having items always online is that you wouldn't be able to shut it down if you at max caps. ( I've had to do this twice now)
---
I would like to see prizes for whoever pays the most tax over a given time period.
---
You are gonna get mixed reviews about this game. Some hate it, some love it, some are inbetween. Personally I find the game enjoyable and I've been playing since beta. There are the standard bugs as there are in all bethesda games but nothing to serious. If you love the fallout franchise as a whole, give this game a shot. It's all multilayer, no npcs or followers etc. The game makes you search for the story instead of the npcs giving you all the info on a silver platter.
---
The explosive effect always showed itself without having to inspect it before.
---
You should be able to see if it has the explosive effect even if the player is away.
---
You have one. No matter how many you pick up, you have one.
---
Confess.  Who is paying you people to post this thread every 90 minutes for the past 2 months?
---
Given the first few months after launch, i would not be surprised to learn in a few years that they wanted to scrap everything, but legal told them they could not.
---
First the disaster of the launch, then it selling for $30 for black Friday weekend, and abruptly going back to normal price halfway through (almost immediate after a class-action lawsuit was filed), then the long periods of minor bug fixes and gameplay nerfs that seemed only intended to draw out play time.
---
At first it was like they didn’t care, then they were told they had to, then they decided to slowly drive people away, then they were told they couldn’t, then they decided to finally sit down and discuss how they were going to ultimately make money off a product whose launch was so bungled that it was termed unredeemable.
---
Ive had such a problem with this. If you find a reliable fix let me know. Ive moved and turned my c.a.m.p. every way possible and still everyone loads into the floor of my stairway.
---
Ammo smith + superduper + 5.56 = easy money.
---
I buy a lot of lead to supliment my farming and still turn a very tidy profit selling 2 rounds per cap.
---
FO76 isn't a MMO tho
---
I agree, it would be cool to see transactions listed in your personal terminal for a set period of time to see who bought what more persistently than a message in game
---
I guess the architecture is already there with the brewing stuff- like how you put booze in the fermenter, it goes into your stash weight and the item condition counts down to fermented- could easily work the same for spoilage on food.
---
A lot of people complained that it's just a rip of FO4, because of the same assets being used etc. These are the same people that don't know Beth wanted to have a multi/co-op WITH FO4, but didn't have the time or resources to work on both, so they released it separately. 
---
I'll be honest, I hated the game at launch because I paid full price, it was a broken mess. Bit it has gradually got much, much better (although still obviously not perfect). There is a cool storyline overall, although it's quite disjointed and you have to piece it together yourself.. there is definitely a good time to be had and the map is huge and quite gorgeous in some places. I imagine the game is pretty cheap now, so go for it
---
I've seen sleeping enemies attack by sliding along the ground at the golf club. They seem to be immune to the first couple hits as well. Love the knew attack mechanic.
---
Nothing like any fallout games. I'm a hardcore fallout fan and was super dubious when this was released... but if you can get over the terrible server stability, lagging in combat... just the general buggy nightmare the game is, it's actually really fun.
---
Yup, that can be a potential problem.  So we remove cap limits lol.  I think any new addition will bring potential issues.  The hope is that they can minimize that.
---
Did the 1st quest , crafted lvl 50 pack. Dont need the mods . No time to do those stupid challenges bethesda make cause they are too lazy to make new questlines or endgame
---
Oh I know, but I figured the Anthem fiasco was the most topical.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/xEpv0Xl.gif](https://i.imgur.com/xEpv0Xl.gif)
---
That...is fucking fantastic news. I thought this was like all the other quest items that were one and done.
---
Happened to me. 4 machines just unloaded. Huge pain in the ass. However I had no issues with camp placements
---
More like unfinished work being released for free
---
You can? I haven’t seen the plans there for these headlamp plans only the X-01 headlamp plans from the Enclave.
---
Dang he's onto us. 😂 Been actually contemplating this the past couple of weeks.
---
I agree with this, but it would be yet another reason to have to farm plastic. =P
---
A recent update change is supposed to make it so you only need the first foundation "supported" so that it's easier to place your camp.
---
I have not tried it yet, I like my current spot near Morgantown
---
Try trading one and see what happens.
---
Yeah, there's actual human beings working in all companies. It's also worth noting that these particular human beings, specifically, screwed us pretty hard a few months back. So I find it difficult to cheer them for doing what they should have done right in the first place, instead of grabbing the money and running away. We shouldn't be cheering on someone for doing the right thing, eventually. 
---
And no. If I fucked my customer over, and then months later began delivering, piecemeal? No, I wouldn't expect praise. And rightly so. I also don't expect praise for routine. If I do go out of my way and do a custom piece that comes out beautifully, sure. But this is, again, not that situation. Just look at the bug report from the latest patch. It's not quality work.
---
If you want to fluff them, go right ahead. But to me, this is landing dangerously close to normalizing this kind of behaviour.
---
I would have expected Cop A Squatter to appear since you have to talk to the robot in the EMS building, but I just did it and it does not.
---
Thanks for the ideas I will build a new C.A.M.P and try to incorporate all of them especially the open ring base extended over a high cliff.
---
I am still chuckling
---
Put the website in 'desktop' mode. Problem solved!
---
All of her other holotapes are in the world as soon as you leave the vault. The nuke one doesn't appear until you launch it so it's just a safe assumption that she had to still be kicking to see you blow up the whitesprings.
---
Did you apply a custom skin? Any skin from atom shop will make an item untransferrable
---
Throughout the day I’m reading lots of lore and listening to holotapes on a sofa while players shop at my CAMP, I leave refreshments out. At night is when I roam Appalachia, do my routine of dropping off items at Vault 76. Hide out in the Mire by a fire and kill anything in sight while searching for Mothman
---
They're just for you, so the only use for more than one would be to put different lenses on each.
---
well I went ahead and started the ticket just to get the "paper trail" going maybe some of my characters luck stat will carry over to the real world for me
---
At the moment, I have supposedly picked up three Technical Data.  Only one shows in my Inventory.  I attempted to move one to my Stash but couldn't locate a single one in Inventory when it came time to transfer (tried Inventory, Junk, Aid, Miscellaneous, Notes . . . no Technical Data to be found).  Closed Stash and Technical Data (one) was back, right there in Inventory.   It's a mad, mad, mad, mad Fallout world . . .
---
But so 1 or 2k is a fair price to set it at, then?
---
I can never seem to find kindling, first couple times I thought I was just supposed to collect wood. Now I find maybe 2 or three kindling and that's it.
---
Gnnaaaah! Gnagarrr?
---
Better yet: swapping pocketed and regular armor, becoming encumbered from the now reduced carry weight, and having to use the glitch to fast travel back to camp so you could safely log off and back on.
---
Oh. So they are allowed to pre-prepare DLC up to a certain point? 
---
How far along are they allowed to plan? How much work can they do before they have to say "Oh, boys, stop working, some lady on the internet has set this thresh hold as pre prepared DLC and base game content" 
---
And what happens if some of your team finished their projects before launch? Sorry team you can't actually start making anything. Just make some doodles. We'll come back to em 6 months from now.
---
It's definitely darker in some instances for me, but other times there's still that unnatural glare.
---
The vending machines at the Scout camps.
---
Well the new camp Adams event also spawns all types of insects and also free range when it’s at Fred’s bbq spawns several wolfs as the first attack on the brahmin.
---
Holy shit I had no idea I was supposed to power it.
---
PC: Lab\_Rat. Weapons, Armor, Plans, Ammo, Mods, Stimpacks and Chems.
---
If I could,  I would give you a gold karma.  This is awesome
---
I'm 99% sure the reason this isnt already in the game is because of the game engine not being able to handle it, if you ever played FO4 and build huge settlements, you'll know that the engine tends to erm... crash and burn when theres too many built objects in an area, this is probably why the camps have to be certain distances apart and why we have camp budgets.  
---
I'm not against the idea, but theres bigger reasons why its not here
---
It's a beast for sure.  A bloodied one gets up over 600 per shot which is nuts for an "auto"v weapon
---
Thank you for this
---
Thanks for the answers guys, I know there's been plenty of outrage about this game, some people even had valid concerns but I always thought the hate was exaggerated, the game seems pretty cool imo from what I've seen of it at least, I think I might just buy it, especially because I can get it at half price.
---
So if it’s already in the game , why did I have to download it?
---
Not me.....this is hotfix material especially with the weekend being here.
---
Just shoot the player a message. I found an item I thought was possibly the one I was looking for and sent a PM asking them to let me know next time they were in camp because the game is glitched and we cant inspect things and they came right over. Some people will do that. It sucks but it's worth a shot.
---
I found the lack of unbridled settlement building somewhat of a surprise, but don't even think about it anymore. I have a minimal camp and have been set free to explore the map much more, and boy what a map!
---
Also the lack of human npc interaction and no voice for our character felt empty and actually pretty lonely and sad for a while but that went once I got used to the new atmosphere. The holotape voice acting is of a high standard and listening to the stories of all those people is quite engrossing and haunting. 
---
FO76 is different to FO4 but in a good way I think, my opinion!
---
How do you die of starvation if it deals less damage than health regeneration?
---
Has anyone gotten or know how to get the different skins for the backpacks yet? Not the one from the atom shop.
---
What? I said let us turn them off, not make them useless when nit powered
---
Your gonna hate fallout 76😂
---
Nope.
---
yeah, I should've included the "/s" \^_\^, but I agree
---
You can trade the broken ones, but as soon as you craft it, it's no longer tradeable.
---
Bethesda messed up and you expect people to give them a free pass?
---
lol there was that was 2 hours that was absolut~~e~~ly fucking was that this. thanks!!!
---
It plays like Fallout 4, only without conversations or a bunch of NPCS to talk to.  The whole combat, crafting, loot-and-shoot system is virtually the same.
---
No they wouldn't even give me any actual information it's vague to say the least energy type weapons were removed who'd assume in-game physics plays a small role in their decision to remove the energy type weapons energy and explosive are obviously not the same no information regarding what their future looks like no road maps for any of this information just very vague information regarding energy type weapons being removed among others
---
So the first day this dropped I was getting patches about half the of time... Since the hotfix I've done the event ten more times and gotten nothing new, nor any badges. Can somebody confirm it's working as intended and I've just had bad luck?
---
Read the full post. I acnt just store it
---
I was going to list them in the vending machine but it won't let me do it. So can only broadcast it here.
---
It's really a huge chunk of eye candy. They should make it produce cola, even only one bottle per hour. Or they can sell a functional one in the Atom shop.
---
Why do you think that?
---
This game needs a Sawzall mod!
---
The new free DLC (mid April release and would be Temportary) was indefinitely pushed back until further notice. Been 1 update since then (came out Monday I believe) that fixed 6 tiny things and broke the major endgame content where it didn't drop any loot. Not looking good
---
Too Confederatey
---
Tesla?
---
You are missing the point. It isn't DLC it was part of the game they just locked behind a wall and didn't give us access to. Until later when they wanted to release "DLC". 
---
At what point would you accept that a dev locked base part of the game behind a lock and didn't let you access it and tried to claim it was "DLC"? 
---
Or are you a nutter that thinks developers can lock base parts of the game away from players until later when they want to claim they are releasing "free dlc"?
---
Grow up.
---
I had this problem, too. What finally worked for me was walking up the roller coaster track until I was practically up the crocodile’s butt; then I was finally close enough to to get the photo to register.
---
I'm going to add you and visit your dollar store tonight! 🧡
---
Who’re you again?
---
Has happened one or twice to me since the beta, you can actually land in on a server that no one is on, If you wait long enough other players will eventually appear, but can take some time, its a very rare situation I imagine.
---
Climb to the top of Charleston herald headquarters. Look for the suspension bridge. Jump from there. There is shallow water and it downs you but doesnt kill you. Make sure the person doing the revive is also standing in the water.
---
Funny enough your post was auto removed by our filter built to remove those type of posts. We catch a LOT more of them then those that get through.
---
You didn't, you were downloading the patched files that were fixing longstanding bugs that should have been fixed months ago.
---
If I find one.
---
I guess... i mean it has an X like the confederate flag but it doesn’t have stars and the confederate flag doesn’t have a central emblem or two lines...
---
I don't understand the negativity in this thread. 
---
"This game will be broken on launch" -Bethesda 
---
Then people get salty that it's exactly like that? Omegalol
---
Will buy this from you. How much?
---
I'm always doing my new camp with hard way, I'm designing it different every time I replaced my camp, lol. Thanks away for your concern! :)
---
Perhaps if the bulked item is deconstructed on purchase you could be refunded with the materials 😀.
---
&gt;I've had zero buyers that I'm thinking of just putting up shit to make it look like i got a lot.
---
Do it. I am amazed at what people are buying. Shit like duplicate rug plans that I normally would have just dropped are flying out the door at 25c each. I've sold 50+ maps for 20-30.
---
If you don't have a bunch of random crap, take your excess junk and make things. Last night I found a guy camped near 76 that had 3 vending machines full of low level gear. 
---
One machine was filled with level 1 and 5 leather armor sets for 10-15c per piece, another was stocked with modded machetes, bats, knives, and axes for 10-30, and another with modded pipe weapons and low level BOS recon rifles. The 4th machine had an assortment of rare plans, junk, and endgame equipment, so even as a high level player it was worth stopping by. 
---
Load it up, make the prices reasonable, and people will click to your store.
---
Oh man, when I was searching for a new spot to build my
---
CAMP I was thinking how cool it would be to have a map of where water is. This is awesome, thank you!
---
I'm hopeing they run the eso model on it and give us content until fallout 5 lol except ESO is pay to win. The new content is pretty cool and diversify the in game market.
---
Not new
---
It's one of those things where, if the quest was available from the start, you'd naturally complete a fair bit over the course of the main quest or on the way to Lv. 50 (provided you had the bloody camera).  The problem comes when you're binging it, trying to get your backpack ASAP.
---
Spawning you outside the camp bounds could lead to a lot of player deaths in high areas. In general I find people who use concrete foundations are okay, wood and I'm trapped. Concrete seems to push me up and into structures.
---
This guy names.
---
I've been attacked and killed by mobs of invisible ghouls at Whitespring when logging in opposite the clubhouse, once I'm dead and on the ground they appear and walk off :)
---
Where do they come from? I've never seen one besides in a player vendor.
---
Unfortunately, i am only looking to trade it for other mods. But i can't understand WHERE i've got it.
---
The tadpole challenges are a bit mundane but they instantly get 100x more difficult and challenging when you become a possum scout
---
If you find extra broken prosnap deluxe cameras, **do not** craft or repair them. You can only gift/trade the broken version.
---
Agreed. Vaguely says "I dont like colored people but I love my sister"
---
I do the same thing. Players of all levels go there. And if I was a level 10 and found awesome level 50 stuff I'd hold onto it. 
---
I dump ammo and plans mostly though.
---
I personally love the new survival leaderboard, it gives us non godly players a chance on some kills.  Besides you can see who is killing on the game, and they will undoubtedly be on the map so just fast travel away from them, and event hop.  You can't kill during events so you're safe there. Other option, set up a turret base if you're being stalked, or just hop servers... there are plenty of servers where people don't hunt you down.
---
I do however agree there should be a deathmatch mode as well
---
But you don't blame Taco Bell when someone at KFC or Pepsi does something. It isn't the same thing as Zenimax has nothign to do with the devs.
---
I have a Combat Knife with 40% faster swing speed as one of it's modifiers. Cuts through ghouls and other packs like butter.
---
Interesting. Hadn’t seen it before
---
Yea right and drive down prices?! This is capitalism baby!
---
The Free States project logo is a porcupine with a yellow theme, so if you can work that into the flag then I think youre onto something.
---
That's great! You did a great job!  With your carry weight of 273 with the backpack, I'm guessing your character level is in the 30's (?) 
---
But I hate to break it to you, it's all relative to your build.   I kill them all the time.
---
I used to have a similar experience when I ran across high-level ScorchBeasts or Deathclaws, but not after I specialized.
---
I used to run a stealth sniper build, but I started a second character and it became a stealth melee build tailored around one handed and unarmed weapons.  The meat hook benefits from perks from both of those categories at the same time.
---
I have a level 91 bloodied build and a bloodied meat hook.  With perks, armor and mutations I have a strength of 36.  If I sneak (with my chameleon armor), I can one-hit kill a level 50-ish SheepSquatch (or up to about a level 64 ScorchBeast).  A level 91 of either one only takes 2-3 hits.  When I do the Free Range quest, I wait until everyone has hit it and then wade in and off the 'squatch with one or two hits.  The imposter SheepSquatch is a different story, but I still take about 25% of it's health with each sneak hit (and then it kills me after each hit - lol). 
---
In your video, I see you hit a lvl 22 supermutant twice to kill it.  By comparison, level 68s for me are ALWAYS a one-hit kill (and they usually explode because of Bloody Mess).
---
At 10% health or so, my meathook is doing around 2500 damage (it varies) which becomes 7500 due to the Ninja perk.  
---
If you want to duplicate my results, use this perk load out, 4 pieces of unyielding armor and 1 piece of chameleon (add +1 strength pieces too if you can)
---

---
Hype for incoming 3\* Shovel memes.
---
Found a spot that works like a charm: Big Maw in The Mire. There is a shallow pond that spawns an angler or radtoad. Beautiful.
---
Yea this is how I slay these vendors! And I only have 4 pieces and hard bargain 3. I don’t take anything chems or drink any drinks etc. I just pop in once a day and unload the previous days random crap.
---
Temped to make my character more ghoul looking just for added effect...
---
Not really I don't like ESO but I'll still buy tes6. I get that ESO is a mmo to bring the community together and keep them busy until the next major release just like 76.
---
That’s the logo of the American Libertarian party what are you talking about?
---
I just got a patch 3 hours ago.
---
They're untradeable.
---
This one is bugged :) can you borrow me it if you are on PS4?
---
Edit: i found out you are on PC. I am so unlucky everyone who have this plan is on PC :D
---
Yeah I’ll let you know if anything works for me. I submitted another support ticket so hopefully they fix it one day.
---
For a freestates member, anything. PM me
---
Shhh dont let them know...its a secret. Only people who complete weekly's know
---
But nobody can see that they are 25k cap worthy products before spawning into your shower, so whatever you put in there isn't exactly a lure.
---
yes please!!!
---
It will come back after a few minutes, usually by the time I go to the third tree, the first tree has it again.
---
Truly a Heroic Llama.  This is fantastic, thank you.
---
You don't have a smartphone? Keep reaching bud
---
It's separated into 32(?) people simultaneously, but since those worlds are not hard boundaries you can effectively play with thousands.
---
Well if we get bulk ammo. Capitalism is gonna see you lowering your prices lol
---
I'm interested in seeing if this is possible as well - the last time it came up, the spawn points were...ambiguous at times, from what I read.  There were spawn points that had certain events, but not others, and there were quite a few other kinds that weren't documented enough to know exactly *what* they were spawning.
---
There are a couple people mapping things like that manually from observations, but nothing that could be easily mapped in a meaningful way automagicly.
---
There's a somewhat static spawn in the toxic valley, in an underwater safe. The problem is most of the time it spawns at level 20. Although the damage is trash either way, I don't think there's even a damage difference between the level 20 and 50 versions
---
The New Hampshire Free States movement is related, but I don’t think it would be good to work the porcupine into this as that’s a real world group, different from our in-game group and it would clutter the flag
---
Fallout and Bethesda in general have a very loyal fan base and I and many of my friends have spent real money in the atom shop and have continued to play since the beta. I think they know that their fans will come back or they will eventually be able to attract more players with better updates. 
---
I personally have been playing since the beta and I unfortunately spend too much money in the atom shop every month.
---
This has happened since day 1. My camp always has some technical data or a weord satellite dish spawning in it.
---
Of course I don't, which is why I filed a support ticket to get my replacement bag.
---
you will have to clarify, i don't understand what you mean.
---
I have enjoyed getting my story from holotapes I can get back story while playing. It's a nice change.
---
I say buy it I bought 76 at launch for full price and have no regrets VATs will take some getting use to but once you figure it out you'll be fine.
---
“Thanks Bethesda for doing what you should have done before the game was released” Fixed your title for you.
---
Done that but I'll try again.
---
rip, all good. I thought for a second that there was some hidden way of getting them, or people found a glitch to transfer the effects over between pipe guns or something
---
you understand me well!
---
I'm all about big picture capitalism, you know working against the public's best interest for profit.
---
Using the view desktop option seemed to fix it for me.
---
You can choose to "search" for a componant. Wood wouldn't even show up for me even though I know I had some on me. I need to collect more wood for cooking.
---
500 caps, 5 bucks, for Another 6month delay, thats BS
---
Ah, ok. I'll probably dump them then, I don't need a pound of stash space going to waste if it's a farmable item
---
I...never put mine away? Was this honestly ever a real issue? I've had once up since December and never once was it destroyed.
---
*edit: spelling*
---
then what's the problem with people reporting on it?
---
Enter night
---
I wish we could sell the repaired cameras for people trying to complete the quests/challenges because it can be hard to find one. I think it’s weird that I can sell film (which sells like hotcakes for me), so why not cameras? Smh. I suppose you can always stuff them in trash cans and suitcases at train stations for people while we all wait for Bethesda decides to make a change.
---
My PC is more than fine. You are disagreeing and downvoting yet you haven't even tried it. Seriously, go try it, you are flat wrong and it's easy to prove. Placing multiple of the same item like a typical base, or even 20 different items, doesn't take nearly as much horsepower as placing one instance each of many different items.
---
There are a number of places where there is water but no plants, so the list here isn't complete exactly (though it's a damn sight better than anything else!).
---
Someone was looking into a graphical map that used actual in-game visuals to create a map, using the game model offline to render the map.  Not sure how feasible that will turn out to be ethough.
---
I guess I'm mixing up veins with deposits?
---
We’re off to never never land
---
I understand that but seems bit of a headache to transfer caps to a “mule” and some don’t have a 2nd Xbox or a friend to help trade the caps over .
---
Haven't had an opportunity to do the campfire event yet...but it sounds like I'll finally be able to put my Exterminator's Tesla Rifle to good use :)
---
So it's a known bug then? And yeah, i'm on PC :D
---
You have to stabilize the flux you get from nuke zones. For each stable you need 10 unstable. You also need glowing masses, high-radiation fluids, and hardened masses.
---
Zenimax OWNS bethesda. That is why I said if the Mcdonald CEO does something wrong you blame Mcdonalds even though Mcdonalds are franchised and owned by private owners, not the CEO of Mcdonalds.
---
Same with pointing out Zenimax is acting just as fucked up if not more so, and they own bethesda, which means the problems aren't just in bethesda, but are part of the whole company from the very top down.
---
Where can you even buy the plan.
---
Like people don't know about it, but i am here non-stop 3days so i know everything lol. Shame no PS4 want to share with this plan :D
---
I sold a bunch at 1 cap and got them.  Did you forget that they take a 10% transaction fee?
---
I do know it's increased if sitting on a chair or sleeping. The specifics I do not know though.
---
Enclave Production terminal vendor.
---
What category do serums show up under on the map view? I've been looking for someone to sell me chameleon, but no luck so far.
---
There isn't one. I never said there was, nor did I imply it.   
---
HOWEVER;   
---
Juicehead sounds like a bitch, and Legacy can barely string together enough words to form a coherent thought.

Well, it was marketed as a game-as-a-service; there is no "finished product" in that market. Anyone who has ever played any mmo knows GaaS are in continuous development. They explicitly said, from the very first announcement, that the game would grow and evolve based on player feedback. Honestly for all the shit people give it for bugs and instability and lack of content at launch, it wasn't any worse than pretty much every big mmo.
---
I think the OP was referring to being so low on HP from starvation that a molerat or radrat nipping his ankles killed him, whereas if he hadn't had been starved, it wouldn't have killed him...for everyone saying he didn't die from starving...he sorta did in a roundabout way if that's what happened.
---
I read that and said no.. no you didnt.. I'm with you fella.
---
The only other skin right now is the Possum skin from the vendor machine.
---
I forgot to check the market in the past 3 days. God damn if i knew there were plan for the mods then i wouldn't have grinded for 8 fucking badges. Feels bad
---
The BoS vendorbot used to sell the plans for crafting them.  I'm assuming he still does.  You need to have a rank 1 Science perk equipped to make them though.
---
This is NOT another delay, this is the original ticket response from December, just to be clear.
---
Add me... Dookiestorm... is run the Fallout 76 video club on xbox... so I'm down to help the people of the wasteland
---
You're doing Atom's work, my child!
---
As far as i am aware they sell the plans for all T series armors there.
---
People like you Free States heathens are the reason I put all my stores in the garage. Don't want you smelling up the house.
---
They are in aid.
---
True..but I have characters whom I use all the time both are level 75-ish..I'm not too fond of mules
---
I got a bloodied lever for 200 caps. It's only 1* but as a collector of bloodied weapons I thought it was awesome. I've paid a lot more than that for other bloodied weapons I was missing before
---
It's pretty easy to not read their posts. Some people are interested in what they find.
---
DUh, you can't.  Because PC doesn't have a built-in chat.  Have you *read anything I wrote*.
---
Yeah, depends on who is going for the gun. I look for low level gear. Trying to get ready for the legendary character update
---
Yeah. I'm not even certain that the rest stop between Ripper Alley and Huntersville - all improbable brawls all the time - would even be classified similarly in code to the two spots near the Harper's Ferry train trestle (Messenger/Rachel/Nanny/tamable animals/govt supply drops at one, space piñatas/deathclaw/sheepsquatch nests/civil war reenactors/trick-or-treaters at the other).
---
Frankly, I'm most interested in tamable animals, but I love random encounters of all descriptions.
---
Bethesda Studios is now pleased to announce that Skyrim is now available to play... ON TODD HOWARD.
---
Ah, I'll check that out. I've been in the dome with the alien stuff many times and was wondering why I'd always find ammo and plans but never the gun itself.
---
so you just made a thread to throw personal insults around?
---
Outside on the stage for the rusty pick. Nukashine is in the bar, downstairs. 
---
But the rusty pick doesn’t work. I haven’t tried nukashine.
---
I’ve got every plan for all the T series power armor but there wasn’t any headlamp plans available at both BoS vendors.
---
PS4.
---
thank you ...finally someone acknowledged this beside me.
---
Heck yea, my 1* bloodied gets over 700 per shot when I'm below 10% health and have full adrenaline going. At that level of health it's not really sustainable, but it's fun to say you can, haha.  A god roll would be bloodied explosive, where I think you could get nearly 1000 per.
---
For anyone curious, that's with full heavy gunner build, nerd rage, and adrenal reaction. Realistically I keep my character in the 30% health range, where my damage is more like 350-400 per shot. Not as impressive, but still pretty effective.
---
It never kicks me out if I'm at CAMP. I've left it for quite a bit of time before accidentally came back still crouched in chameleon on my roof.  
---
But if I dare leave it at the main menu screen it'll log me out after 10\~ minutes. Stupid.
---
I would hold onto at least one, it has potential to be removed since it seems unintended and it really doesnt weigh a lot
---
I don't usually carry shotguns or ammo, so trying to kill a Yao Guai with a shotgun I ran out of ammo and ended up bashing it to death with the gun. It counted.
---
Should work the same w a syringer (I need to make/fine one and get it done myself)
---
That is my guess. you mine a vein, you put an extractor on a deposit.
---
Step 1) make sure your machine has power going to it.  They consume 3 power, and powering the machine puts your camp on the map.
---
Step 2) Go to where people are.  If you're in the ass end of nowhere, people are going to be less likely to visit you.  Assume that everyone but you is hilariously over-encumbered and can't fast travel to you.
---
What don't you get? I literally said I've got friends that have put down *more than 1 of each thing*, as in they've got probably 20 more things from the atom shop they have on top of *everything else*. And it performs fine. I've never had a performance issue no matter how anyone has built, hundreds of different places.
---
Why the fuck do you think that you've built something unique? It's likely most players have literally built every single thing in the game.. no issues whatsoever.
---
RICO'S ROUGHNECKS!
---
I just think to myself what would I pay to get a really good weapon like this, if I hadn't found anything equal to it yet. A thousand, easy. More if it's an objectively good attribute.
---
Unfortunately that hasn’t been my experience.  During one silent night people were able to come in with explosive weapons and kill our group.  We fought back for awhile before giving up.  When we left they just followed us.  The same thing happened on other servers.
---
I would prefer as a general PvE player that I be left out of it until I engage in it actively.
---
The thing is - if 'disability accomodation laws' required you to have text-to-voice translation capability, even if that became law after FO76 was released, then every PC game would have to have it now.  Even if previously released products were grandfathered in, all the stuff released since would have to have it.
---
There are games - like Anthem - that have text chat, were released after FO76, and do not include text-to-chat capabilities. 
---
So whatever reason, it wasn't a legal CYA.
---
Yes...i did this several times before I learned lol
---
I am not a smart man....
---
As soon as you hit the scrap all...."DAMMMMITTT!!!!!!"
---
As someone who puts everything on their shop at 0 caps I can tell you I haven’t had much raiding of my vendor. Most people take a couple of things and leave the rest be. Keep up the good work!
---
Yes but I would like to, these are my sugestions to improve on it and my grief with the way exsplosive weapons are dropped. they can ask for anything say ... 25k caps to select weapon + 1000 script to select traits, because spending that now has very little chances of droping a desired weapon, I want to spend my max resources to get an endgame weapn, why is this so hard
---
ya, I have decided, I am spending all my scrip to get a set of that scout armor. My weapons still suck but that's OK, its easy to one shot most things even on a non-legendary weapon with the right builds.
---
Yeah, the possum challenges are fucking insane.
---
The ski slope was super fun and quite funny.
---
Xbox: RoaringAnemone6
---
Yes this happened to me. Tried everything when texting Beth support. Literally nothing worked so my main character with all my good stuff is unplayable. Sorry this happened to you as well. 
---
Hopefully there’s a fix soon because I’m done playing until if/it gets resolved.
---
I found a 3\* bloodied pitchfork with +40% swing speed and blocking for 35 caps.
---
I bought it - obviously.
---
Not calling you a liar but could you post a screenshot?
---
We were just tadpoles back then, now we’re seasoned possums
---
Hopefully Bethesda will see the game is evolving and 25k is just no gonna work , fallout 4 there was no limit on caps but that was not on a server so who knows..can always hope it’s on the top of the list of things to address
---
I couldn't care less
---
I've been using them just to free up the weight they stick you with.
---
Honestly after the absolute dumpster fire that was the release, the multiple merch issues, malicious marketing tactics, and the customer service fuckery I don't think I'm alone in saying no amount of in-game fixes would warrant a purchase. It's honestly got me worried about TES6 =/
---
I've been playing FO76 for so long that I remember radtoads before they got buffed...you know, when they were "Just OK Toads", but by no stretch of the imagination "rad".
---
If you liked FO4 for the exploration and questing you will Love this game too. The world is beautiful and huge and fun to explore. The difference about exploring in 76 is that is how you trigger most quests. Just by discovering locations quite often triggers a quest of some sort. 
---
If you liked FO4 because you could just keep leveling and adding perks to become all powerful, then 76 might disappoint you. It is an online multiplayer game, so you have to pick your strengths and weaknesses. But you can still get very strong if you build your player properly. 
---
I will add that item and location placements in 76 feel a lot more natural than they did in 4. Most places feel like they belong where they are, and items feel the same. 
---
And as some have mentioned, if you liked 4 for the settlement building, 76 has a similar building experience with their C.A.M.P.s. You cant build as big as in 4, but if you’re creative, you can still build some pretty amazing stuff. 
---
Ive put most games on hold and have been almost only playing FO76 since Christmas. Pretty sure i will be playing for a while to come. Especially if they keep adding the kind of content weve seen lately.
---
I set up shop close to the white springs.  Pretty high traffic there. Just go about your business for an hour. If nothing sells drop the price down by 1000.  I compare what other vendors are selling. Most only have 1 or 2 2* items. I peddle a lot of 3* that i don't use at all
---
Nah it’s like a car manufacturer putting out a car with everything you need, but then putting out a patch later that makes the car do things other cars do (like pulling forward when you let off the brake). Then later they put out DLC that allows you the make the engine better by just paying a little more. Then they keep putting out quality of life improvements until the car is regarded as one of the best cars to buy this decade.
---
Oh wait.
---
&gt; . . .but definitely a bit slower. Again, I/O has nothing to do with it.
---
Which removes its utility in combat.  So I/O does have something to do with it.  Also, it already being present natively on the console platforms means they didn't feel any need to re-make the wheel.
---
Controller vs keyboard isn't much of an issue with co-op.  On a PvP game, you might have a good reason to think about that though.
---
The real iss, as stated above, is simply Sony is a PITA to work with on this stuff.  I've read that it's almost trivial to set up the servers for crossplay, but you can't so with without Sony's blessing.  Licensing costs might come into play too, but I don't think that's the driving issue in play here.
---
Tried everything but nothing works including everyone's suggestions. Stinks.
---
What? What MMO released with less content and end game things to do than fo76? Because I can't think of a single full price MMO that released with less content than FO76 or more bugs. I know both Guild Wars had far more things to do and not buggy, same with WoW, hell even LotRO and DDO had more to do at launch than this game. I am seriously curious what MMO released with less content than fo76 did.
---
I got the only gauss I've ever seen drop last night. Plenty of laser weapons, too; mostly from Super Mutants.
---
Have you tried everything in this video? https://youtu.be/fJzgi3w5KVE I did and it worked for me. I've also recommended this to other people on Reddit and it worked for them. Give it a try :).
---
It is easy to not read the posts, it is way, way harder to avoid the other players who both operate on and openly spread that information.
---
vast majority of people i see posting here seem to care very little about this...
---
Upload to imgur, copy the link, make a new text post on this subreddit, put the link in the text area.
---
I see random bones all over the place but yeah for stuff your more likely get from non items source it would be a waste of time to do more than put something like bone(supermutants) if included at all.
---
Yeah wood would be nice because when i picked up the game again i ran out wood probably from building i thought it would be nice to know where  you could get it in huge concentrated quantities. Although i do agree it would be pointless to know where every single stump or log pile in the game is.
---
That's right!!  Thanks for reminding me!
---
That's what we did! It was tons of fun!
---
Doesn't matter.  The game world doesn't determine the keyboard/controller settings, your local software does.
---
Plenty of games are cross platform, and work just fine.  It's an issue with Sony (and to a much smaller extent, Microsoft) allowing the crossplay feature.
---
Plan, not backpack, somehow it learns you and you have plan still in inventory
---
I've been doing this for a while, have to pop back to 76 to farm them every now and then so I have enough :)
---
imgur is a good photo hosting website. Sign up and upload your photo on there and grab the link and post it on this thread and it should show up. There is also an option when you create a new post. There are little icons that allow you to "add photo"... Hope that helps. :)
---
Original character.
---
Sorry, I should have said you don't blame Taco Bell when Yum! does something. Just becasue a parent company owns another doens't mean they are run by the same people overall. While the stock might ultimatly fall under the same brand, one doesn't always impact the other. Your McDonalds CEO analogy doesn't hold water here. Zenimax can be doing great and Bethesda can being fucking up or vice versa. They are not mutually exclusive.
---
You can have your own opinions on the game, and based on your repsonses in this thread they are heated opionons, and you are more than welcome to them and I won't discount are argue agasint your opionons as they are valid to you and that is what matters here, I was just pointing out your analogy is a bit shite.
---
Nope, that isn't the point of the thread at all. Are you just going to make wild assumptions that repeatedly get shut down until I give up, or what?
---
There are some people that are bad at math complaining loudly.
---
True, but if one is in the neighborhood.
---
I’ve only done open range twice and don’t remember a poison attack.  Maybe I haven’t done the venomous one yet?
---
I understand that.
---
You are capable of criticizing them? ROFL. No you aren't, you can't even accept when others do it.
---
Thank you for your opinion bro
---
Thanks. 
---
PS4
---
if you log out at dyer chemical and log back in the blooms will appear for some reason it's a gltich might take a few hops but usually only one or 2 times. and you do not have to do the heart of swamp for this method to work
---
edit: sorry just read the part  about someone completing the quest recently this might be the case but with the frequency that hopping makes these appear i don't think that is the case
---
If memory serves, there isn't really a 3rd person animation for aiming with the sights on any of the hip-fired heavy guns.  You just magically somehow "see" down the sights.  Hip fired weapons are kind of pure fantasy to begin with.
---
How do you reject an event quest? If you're in the area the game automatically opts you in.  Unless you stand just outside the event area and try to pick people off?
---
Yeah I wouldn't buy them for that much either sorry to say. I bought four max level 1s weapons I've been wanting to try for 200-700 caps yesterday. Guys with camps in whitesprings mostly. I think they farm so many they just want rid of them. The 700 cap one was an instigating railroad rifle. I'm still finding good stuff at vendor bots too when the server is raining legendary stuff and people have more than they can scrap or store. I'm sure there's speculators but I don't think they're the majority. I do plan to resell what i don't like but probably for what I paid or a few caps more.
---
Cool. Thanks for the info!
---
Content wise? Consider Ark. Sea of thieves. Destiny 2. Anthem. For content in comparison to 76.
---
I respect your opinion, even if it's wrong.
---
Here's my current pricing algorithm.
---
Level 1 - 35.... 100c to 200c per star... 100ish caps premium for bloodied or unyeilding.
---
Level 35 -50.... 250c to 500c per star... 500ish caps premium for bloodied or unyeilding.
---
Level 50+.... 500ish caps per star... 500ish caps premium for bloodied or unyeilding.
---
At the moment my mule's machines are mostly stocked with low level gear and I'm getting mostly high level players. so the weapons and armor isn't selling. They are buying Fasnacht plans like crazy, though.
---
Does it have to be the same server
---
I was telling my group this the other night because its ridiculous to pay 1 cap per bullet.
---
Won't happen, ESO is under zenimax not bethesda, and on a different game engine.
---
Maybe I'm different, but I don't want my camp near others. I actually seek out remote places away from major destinations and busy areas. I have my camp on a clifftop overlooking the world, and it's nice and quiet up there, as I prefer it. Great that people come visit and use my vendor, but I don't want people nearby all the time.
---
I’m having the same issue
---
Sometimes when things aren't working as they should, reboot..
---
Well, they aren't putting "impressive amount of work" on FO76. Actually they are putting as less as it is possible. They are only using copy paste objects to create new content.
---
Where did they say it would be broken at launch? Because they said over and over it would be ready at launch and the BETA was just a stress test for the servers, which is why they only let you play a couple hours at a time.
---
I just considered that those bone chime traps would be an easily mappable source of bone - working on that. Regarding wood piles, yes it is simple but knowing *the best* place would be sweet, so I'm doing that now, too.
---
Love it... keep going with all of em
---
&gt; Some people aren't gaming alone from their rooms. Some are in a room with other people.
---
&gt; 
---
Based on my day1, involuntary mic experiences, 100% this.  Everyone I was forced to listen to on day one had all kinds of shit going on in the background, whether it was screaming babies, nagging wives, or a bunch of friends watching them and telling them to name their new character "'Turd Ferguson' lolololol".
---
What if it was like minecraft battle royal??
---
If you can afford it, it's fine, friend.
---
I've stood there for minutes before. At least 10. No machine
---
I decided to buy it after all, I'm pretty hyped tbh I love exploring and finding stuff/quests.
---
Nice! I do think the challenged to get the bagpack make it more fulfilling and rewarding to the mind. :)
---
Some people may not realise that they removed camp damage so don't want to risk hitting the camp by accident and getting wanted
---
then what is the point of the thread? you said you don't have a problem with people reporting on Bethesda's F ups and outright admitted you do have a problem with how Juicehead sounds and how Legacykilla forms sentences.
---
so which one is it?
---
I keep seeing posts about this and I dont see it as a big deal, Im sure bethesda doesn't either. Whats the problem with swapping some perk cards around?
---
I think its an interesting game mechanic.
---
Sent a request
---
It was ready at launch, all the content was there
---
You may have more than one addiction that is bugged and not showing in your pip-boy. Try taking an addictol to see if it helps! Also, if you have herd mentality, that decreases all stats by 2 unless in a team.
---
no usually when i server hop at dyer chemical it just makes them appear.. now they are hard to see and  easier if the server you hop to is at nighttime and you can only collect them once per about 24 hours
---
Just reply so I can find out too
---
Signs and letters is what I believe you're looking for. You can get them in Watoga from Phenix, but they're expensive.
---
Atom shop
---
This post aged very well :)
---
Well, people tend to be negative on the Internet. It's human nature, apparently.
---
I agreed, I hate the circle screen of the build able terminal so really hoped I could load holos on my personal terminal
---
It's pretty common. My group would get sick of PVP griefers/predators, find their camp and ruin them before we left the server. I've destroyed dozens of showers that belonged to people bounty baiting, or harassing low level players. They mostly leave the server.
---
Do it just in the name. Well done!
---
My sense of relief was palpable when I realized *that* wasn't the final test.  I don't think I've ever managed to complete it, even with Marsupial.
---
They didn't abandon it. They shifted it to a different format. 76 still has more dialogue and story than most other fallout titles. But since you weren't there when it happened, you only see it in post. If every last bit of lore and context in the game was played out, exactly the same but with visible human NPCs saying it, no one would dare Suggest the same, even if there's no change
---
This was an atom shop item. Not sure if they're still avail. but im pretty sure it was 500-700 atoms
---
"Man, walking around Appalachia in nuclear winter sure sucks! If only we could go somewhere warmer, like I dunno, the Mojave desert..."
---
this sub does not comprise 100% of the playerbase, you do know that right?
---
Its already shipping, got an email about it two weeks ago
---
It's a dumb article and a dumb headline. There's nothing for players to "not buy", it's a cap sink.
---
It has its issues but overall is a blast...let's just say I was waiting for kh3 to come out forever got it on release day barely touched it cuz this game still has me sucked in. There's always something to do. I love that one day I can just run events, next day is scrap gathering and building, or legendary farming.
---
1: Yes.
---
2: Anyone
---
3: Yes. Although me and a friend worked out the easiest way was to blow yourself up with frag grenades.
---
You are gonna be really disappointed then to learn that the "DLC" they have already released were in the game from BETA and they just had them locked so they could "release" them later as the "free dlc". 
---
These content updates weren't DLC or even updates, they were just opening up parts of the base game they had locked off so they could release later.
---
Think about this, how long it takes them to fix bugs and such. That is the kind of time you will be looking at for content going forward. Because now that they have ran out of parts of the base game they have locked us out of, they will actually have to start adding in content if they want to continue.
---
Basically the base game has the "DLC" already in it from launch up to winter wasteland. It is why the challenges keep getting impossible challenges asking us to do things that we can't because "they aren't in the game yet". Yes they are and that is why the challenges show up for them, because they are there. They just are locked so that bethesda can release those parts of the base game later as "free dlc".
---
I only ever saw the friends welcome sign. Was THAT the letter set? I thought it was a fixed sign. If they had shown it off better I would have bought that in a heartbeat. Is there any way to hack purchase it from the build interface?
---
If you feel the the scout quest is tedious and you just want to blaze through it quick. Do the hunter,athletic and crossbow world challenges I got the quest done within a hour or so. Hope this helps
---
* Force players to undergo rad showers to use my shop.  
---
* Sell Toxic Goo for 1000 caps.  
---
The perfect crime.
---
I don't care about the outrages of a community (the gaming community) that is sadly popular for overreacting and throwing tantrums over every aspect of the gaming industry. As an adult, I find that embarrassing.
---
My choice is to be positive, as it's much healthier. You can keep being negative, that's fine.
---
It just works
---
If you still need this I will be online in about 40mins for about 1 hour
---
No it was a separate item that was released after the friends welcome sign
---
It's a hyperbole you literal pancake.
---
They said the same thing with ESO, so what they did is instead of calling it "DLC" they started calling it "chapters" so they could charge for the DLC without breaking their "free DLC" promise.
---
I’m on iPhone IOS, and can see the high def pic. For me, when I click the imgur link it takes me to the site. Then I click the top right “get app” link, and it’ll either download/install and open, or just open on the app. Once in the app, I open the pic but touching it, and it allows me to download and save.
---
Isn't that neon? I have that on another character. I'm looking for the bulb letters. And yeah, that was SUPER expensive.
---
Yeah all the time! I usually bleed a bit too and grunt like I just got hit. I always look around but there is nothing, and as far as I can tell I don’t lose any healthy. It’s kind of annoying though as I’m usually running cross country and it slows me down.
---
That's a good story based on wild assumptions. I'm cross-posting to r/nosleep
---
Wow ok, maybe i am mistaken. Sorry about that. If i have one in my stash ill give it to you.
---
No kidding? Totally missed that one!
---
I guess so
---
If you install the imgur app it should open in it and work for the high res pic.
---
You can get AA pistols though?
---
Please do, I’m interested in what you find.
---
*jazz music stops*
---
Why I'm on this sub ^
---
And to add to this. If you have high INT and you craft a crossbow which has more than 100% durability. You are better off finding a crossbow to repair because these things are almost immortal even without perks.
---
Surely anyone with 25k caps would have a rough idea of how much serums cost? 
---
Business must be slow, lol.
---
What do you mean "fake garbage". There IS a 10% tax and just as many players disapprove as approve...
---
My biggest problem is the need to store junk in stash taking up room - they need to make loose and bulk junk weightless in stash, since these items are stacks they don't really add up to that many unique items and everyone has them anyways.
---
Think he might mean legendary?
---
Sure if you ignore the content they locked that they are now releasing as the "free dlc" such as the sheepsquatch, backpacks, camera, and Zetans. Those were all there at launch too, but they didn't give us access to them at launch.
---
I rather be that, than part of a group of people that is constantly throwing tantrums about videogames.
---
So thank you!
---
Many people (sheep) who dislike this game have never even played it.
---
Wasn't there an SCP with this premise? This sounds really creepy!
---
the game is buggy as hell, you honestly thought that there was only 1 (one) possible way to dupe things?
---
it's been going on since the beta. there are no public methods, but sellers still get their stock *somewhere*.
---
and no, it's not old stock. it's weapons and armors that were never duped because people never cared for them at the time.
---
I kinda regret buying them. Not super bright but they are a good alternative if you dont have the neon letters
---
Great work! It would be nice to have one map where to find specific types of animals in regions.
---
If you don't have any mutations it could addictions to something as they don't show up.
---
how do you lock the personal terminal?
---
I feel like I am trying to explain chess to a pigeon, and it's going as well as can be expected. Done with you.
---
It's inside the Grafton Dam, in a broken pipe behind (on the otherside of the wall)  the fusion reactor!
---
Seems a shame to put a stop to that!
---
Then mention something that is wrong with the game. There are hundreds of things to choose from. Lets see you actually show a bit of critical thought.
---
I’m not op I don’t need one sorry, I was just curious since you said they was available.
---
Plenty of people like the game and just don't like the tax.
---
You got the facts that they were complete on launch and completely usable without being incomplete? No? Lmao
---
Well, I dunno how, but I found one last night and got the broken wing as a drop!
---
It was definitely random, but now I’m finally done with the badge.
---
I’d agree. It’s actually kind of impressive how much they’re trying to fix things.
---
The game is a lot better since launch and features like vending are cool.
---
I
---
The description percentages were not updated when the datamined percentages were added. I've updated the calculator and added the Strange In Numbers perk option.
---
&gt; I didn't realize
---
Initially I thought everything was simply multiplicative but ingame numbers indicated otherwise. I don't really know why, perhaps multiple persons coded the damage effects and one decided to use additive while the others have decided to use multiplicative.
---
Duping went on for a couple of weeks before it was fixed. It was extremely rampant because a couple of YouTubers showed everyone how to do it because they arrogantly thought Bethesda wouldn't fix it otherwise. There's still duped weapons floating around, and some people claim there's still an active dupe glitch but I have my doubts about that.
---
Awesome! Why wasn't this huge buff mentioned in the patch notes?  I'm so glad I just spent ***NINE PERK POINTS*** on Gladiator cards to make a ripper build! 
---
Thanks, /u/BethesdaGameStudios !
---
Wish you could sell me yours
---
how the hell are all you people able to move before the game loads in? My controls are always locked out till shit loads around me.
---
You said MMO... None of those are MMO's.
---
Can't you only do it once a day?
---
The 1*s I sell are all bloodied, instigating, vampire, or in rare case furious (lmg for example). I in no way would sell my instigating lvl 50 deathclaw gauntlet for less than 1500. Right now it's listed for 2k. 
---
The instigating railway rifle is a nice find at 700.
---
I believe you're missing 1 lead deposit. It's along the edge of the southern border of the map. Close to where the bear is on the map
---
What is your PSN? I will sell you some later tonight....
---
You really are salty, aren't you?
---
Just move on. You'll feel better.
---
Or, you could always keep throwing tantrums about a videogame, that's fine too. *shrug*
---
Well they are morons that don't understand that the tax is vastly beneficial to the game.
---
The event starts as soon as anyone walks into Camp Adam at night. I haven't server hopped for this event I just do my normal business during the day and then once its night, in game, I fast travel to Camp Adam's and do the event. I've done the event 7 times so far, the first two times I did it there were other players there with me but the past five times I've done it on my own. 
---
Here are the rewards I've received from the event after 7 completeions:
---
- 3 Possom Coins
---
- 2 Smore's Plans
---
- 1 Campfire Tent Plan
---
I'm helping him/her vent. It's very healthy, and he/she clearly needs it.
---
C'mon dude. There were like 20 wars to dupe. All patched. I sell tons of super rare stuff that ARE old stock.
---
just needs a CAMP /noclip to be the default for a few seconds after load.
---
Don't forget the Drill!
---
Not a crime.. that's genius!
---
I've been hoping this is what they do. The lack of living NPCs to interact with took a lot away from the game for me. It would be great if eventually from the west raiders started migrating in. Fingers crossed.
---
I believe that may be true, now that you say it. You could still hold the items, restart the quest each day and insta-complete it by already having everything.
---
You might not call out a compnay for something the parent company does. But most people do, because what a parent company does normally shows the way the hierarchy of the company is structured that causes and allows those actions. 
---
So yes, if the company that owned Taco bell did something shitty, it absolutely looks bad on taco bell and all of the companies owned by that company.
---
i bulit a small generator in my camp and that worked.
---
All of the arguements I have heard in favor of the tax are easily refuted.
---
"if you have the base backpack on  and are at the max wieght and put on PA"
---
Pretty specific and doesn't amend the problem in any substantive way
---
Lol, you literally can't read, I've been done with you.
---
For the athletic badge..do you actually have to do the courses? Or can you just run beside it?
---
I had to suppress marsupial cause the clipping on some of the ropes pushed me away if I came from too high. I haven't uncontrollably yelled explicits like that for a long time.
---
Lmao seriously annoying, I wanted to bash the damn crossbow against a wall
---
Dyslexic so thanks for nothing. :(
---
Hard to read them. Maybe consider people's reasons for asking?
---
Yes, they were datamined from the BETA that they were complete and ready. Hell why do you think the challenges kept screwing up and having things listed that "aren't in the game" repeatedly? Because they were already in the game and even the challenges were already coded for them too. So they were complete and working at launch.
---
....and just like that, misinformation is spread as the truth.
---
The biggest difference i found jarring is that you are not the bd gun weilding protaganist able to make decisions in quests that can affect the wasteland.  
---
In this you are more of a detective following a trail to peice together events that already happened through notes, holotapes, etc. Which is rewarding in its own way as well.
---
I have been in one of these.  
---
Hmm, do I want to pay that much for a... wait. where did the vendor go?  
---
Insert theHitchiker's Guilde falling whale internal dialogue.
---
Still bugged
---
No but see they're an EXPERT crack game developer who has DATAMINED the game and fixed EVERY bug Bethesda hasn't oh also by the way they're working on a secret project to crack the game and allow free servers just ignore the fact that's nothing special and hundreds of people do that with every game ever made and being part of it is nothing worth noting given the vast majority of such efforts end in failure except for possibly some small team who just use it as a means for easy money and have worse values and practices then the actual company itself
---
I don't even play the game but this gets my upvote! Amazing piece of work and dedication. GG
---
Would love an auction house.
---
That would honestly be the simplest fix if they could make it apply to only camp items but you could easily get into locked doors that way. 
---
I mean I still do that a lot just by virtue of where I spawn in so it may not be a huge deal.
---
Do you mean legendary or certain prefixes for them?
---
Because I had 2 non legendary Gauss rifles drop this week alone.
---
Several more before.
---
Don't think any were legendary though.
---
Ah, sorry about that..
---
I'd say my biggest criticism towards the game is the PvP aspect, since I'm a PvP player in most games. Survival is simply a complete mess, as well as the balance between legendaries, where only a couple are viable.
---
But if you bothered to check my post history, you would have already noticed what I think needs fixing in this game.
---
Damn it, I was hoping that the royal jelly issue would be fixed if it ever became relevant to new content.
---
Thank you. I'm dyslexic so it's nice to have real answers instead of read patch notes.
---
If I wanted to spend an hour and a half of my life very frustratingly trying to read them, I'd have done it. Didn't feel like getting a headache
---
Well, he corrected it and said that it was from december wich was not stated above.
---
SallyTheAltarBoy, will be adding you tonight.
---
Yet I don't see only form of proof... how strange
---
Tried a addictol and that didn't fix it.
---
Its weird cause normally when it doesn't match your level screen SPECIAL it says (+3) or (-2) but when im in my pipboy it just flat out says Charisma 7 with no (-2) next to it
---
As far as i know and read it has to be night for get the blooms
---
I haven't seen the trick or treaters since the patch that nerfed costume sales.
---
I like your attitude
---
That's what I'm saying, indeed.
---
Thank you for explaining it much better than me.
---
How is my opinion wrong? All objects are basicly just a copies from Fallout 4. All Atom shop items are just a copies of old items with just different colors/skins. Please provide your evidences. These evidenced I told are very easy to testify.
---
No, buy serums cheap, around 150 each, then sell them expensive to the in game vendors.
---
Best method. Trust me.
---
I see one of them nuke code pieces on the ground at Harper's fairy quite often but it can't be picked up.
---
It's why I've dipped out of video games the past 2 years. It's getting worse and worse with people like yourselves, complete dolts.
---
One of my favorite launch memories was watching Dansgaming stream his struggle with that course for like 2 hours.
---
Confirmation bias. Look it up.
---
&gt;You really are salty, aren't you?
---
Nope, not at all. Why would I be salty about some buggy video game?
---
&gt;Just move on. You'll feel better.
---
That would require me to not feel good already. I feel great, been having a good laugh at you and silly things you try to say. Like your lack of an argument outside of "you are salty".
---
&gt;Or, you could always keep throwing tantrums about a videogame, that's fine too. shrug
---
Pointing out a game has lots of bugs is throwing a tantrum? Yeah, never have kids, you'd not be able to handle it if you think just pointing out a game is full of bugs and a company is involved in shady practices is throwing a tantrum. LMAO
---
On imgur, they want you to use the app for the full res pic. If you “open in app” it will allow the full res.
---
I like sky bases because views are nice? Why does it  instantly have to be an ego thing.
---
fine. What I'm talking about then is ongoing advantages as in buffs/debuffs to states.
---
...It literally says response from December 11, 2018 at the top in the header....
---
and they were all variations of the same method. I think there were only 2 methods made public.
---
to me it's surprising that you people honestly believe they patched duping for good when the game is so buggy and it's such an easy thing to do.
---
but enough said, someone was recently selling a god roll for pvp. probably the best weapon you can get at this point. except it's a very underappreciated roll that literally nobody thought to dupe back then, only recently people realized its true potential (and value).
---
and the guy had 6. **six**.
---
Oh shit, my bad haha
---
You got to the course. The courses are super easy except for the one on the bridge I only say that one hard because you can fall through gaps.
---
What would you accept as proof? I'll be glad to supply it when you let me know what you want as proof. As I've datamined the game since BETA.
---
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loki.fallout76guide
---
You're assuming there's any amount of caps that would make me equally happy when I lose an item. That amount is probably higher than the cap limit. The cap limit also means that I cannot accept 15K caps right now, even temporarily. 
---
I'm not against the cap-limit, but it is currently precluding using caps as a medium for exchange.
---
Which known issues list did you mean? The one on Reddit hasn't been updated
---
I tried it a few times before I realized “wait, shouldn’t there be a message box and lil yellow flags? I better look around a little...”
---
I am the same way. This update to me is the best thing they have done. I love visiting bases and having people come to mine and on top of that I make good caps and find lots of things to buy.
---
I noticed this as well. We had a similar group and it took us longer than ever to kill her.
---
Thanks, I’ll see if it works :))
---
you mean re-poop-ulate?
---
Vent about what? Lmao
---
The broad has a point and you have yet counter it.
---
10 events and zero badges. Rng....
---
Agreed I just went to low level scorch area and bashed my crossbow against the scorch until the bow was repairable again
---
ROFL, that's it? Not a single mention of any bugs. Why am I not surprised. All you could bring yourself to "criticize" them for is you don't like exactly how they do pvp in the game. Not the game breaking bugs. Okay. LOL
---
Thank you!!! Wish I could upvote 1000 times!
---
"Thing I don't like is cancer"
---
I'm a little disappointed when they don't have a look around though.
---
The way you keep talking and your constant name calling tells me otherwise. But hey, whatever you need to tell yourself to make you feel better. I'm here to help you, my friend.
---
Laughing is good! That's the way to go, good girl!
---
Keep talking about my life as if you knew anything at all, by all means. But I'm starting to feel a little awkward seeing you constantly embarrass yourself like this.
---
I guess some adults never truly grow up. Your daughters must be really proud...
---
It's not a tax, it's a service and licensing fee paid to the Fallout Vending Co., LLC.
---
Anyone calling it a tax doesn't have an understanding of economics.
---
**Tax**:
---
 1. A charge imposed ny authority on persons or property **for public purposes**
---
 2. A sum levied on members of an organization **to defray expenses**.
---
**Fee**:
---
 1. A fixed charge
---
 2. A sum paid or charged for a service
---
Edit: don't want to be insulting...
---
Count me in lol
---
After i made it, fuming because the challenge wasn't checked, i was heading to the teapot to get the daily done...well good that i'll took the bridge. Kind of embarressing.
---
I would not. Two shot is pretty bad.
---
Really? Haven't seen it. Maybe they should start looking at how Grinding Gear Games operate.
---
lol I think that I will put some TP and spoiled milk in my vendor so that they will have the materials on hand
---
Uhuh still not seeing any proof here dude
---
Luck of the draw, I think. It seems silly, till you find yours destroyed and are paying the flux to fix it. Then its not silly anymore.
---
I see a lot of complaints about not being able to choose specific ranged weapon type...
---
1. Variety is the spice of life. Live a little.
---
2. Most of the ranged weapon perk cards exist in three different SPECIAL groups. If you aren't geared to be able to switch between 2 or 3 different weapon types by the time you're at about level 70-80, you're playing this game wrong.  There are way too many fun weapons in this game to limit yourself to just one type.
---
Kinda defeats the purpose of locks for those who aren't using vending machines, though.
---
What was it?
---
i know. and i wish the main person spreading the misinformation would've edited his wrong comments once he figured out he was wrong instead of just erasing them. that helps no one but his own appearance to others.
---
"FIST"
---
“I don’t remember eating a pathetic failure.”
---
Maybe. Maybe not. Who knows!
---
It was changed last week with the update.
---
I only ask because the day of the patch, I was somehow able to do it 3 times, but I think it was a glitch. Since then, I haven't been able to more than once a day. I wasn't sure if there was a way to have it do it again.
---
But yeah, after the first time, I went ahead and collected a bunch of each so I don't have to collect them each time. Makes things so much easier.
---
aw man the last patch must've changed that.  too bad
---
Or just look at the computer strapped to your wrist.
---
He’s PC
---
The first class action never actually happened. It was just a law firm trying to get attention by announcing they were \*considering\* a class action.
---
Yea I had a moment of "well fuck me" then just decided to play it off as if I was just doing it to do it haha
---
Ran it twice the other night, didn't feel different to me fwiw
---
If you get along with no settlements that need your help then...yeah
---
For real, It just has a similar design as it has an X.  Take a look at the flags for United Kingdom, Jamaica, Burundi, Basque Islands or Scotland.  It looks similar to those flags as well.
---
The scorched have finally run out of Wood Legs and rolling pins so are holding out for longer, FedEx are on the case!
---
Non-issue.  
---
If they are not on your team, they are not fast travelling to your camp.  
---
If they are on your team, the locks open for them already.
---
&gt; The way you keep talking and your constant name calling tells me otherwise. But hey, whatever you need to tell yourself to make you feel better. I'm here to help you, my friend.
---
What constant name calling? Are you confusing me with someone else? I've not called you any names except in response to YOU calling me names. 
---
Seems you are delusional, first you think this game isn't a buggy mess that is barely playable, and now you are deluding yourself into thinking I'm calling you names everywhere. Oh my, you really do have mental health issues.
---
I also love how you can't respond to any of my questions because you are incapable of having an adult conversation and have to rely on "u mad" over and over like a child.
---
I found mine by server hopping tandom encounter in mire.
---
 Crevasse dam has an encounter and if you ft to tree tops head north to highway and follow road to bridge, very short walk.
---
So the other 20 or so skins they showed the images of just aren't out yet?
---
But bear in mind the building is has far greater limitations, smaller budget, and no mods. 
---
Having said that, I’m still having fun and making the best of it.
---
I see reading comprehension isn't your strong suit.
---
Don't worry, I will do an "explainlikeimfive" just for you: notice that I said my *biggest* criticism, not my *only* criticism.
---
Of course there are bugs. A lot of them. I simply try to be positive, because I can clearly see what being negative does to people... like you.
---
I know I don't care. I know I am very mildly inconvenienced when I have to grab a calculator to multiply the price I want for the item I have by 1.11 to account for the 'Bethesda tax' but other than that I honestly could not care less if that's what it takes to keep the in-game economy 'healthy'.
---
How do you know that?
---
The work that should of been put in before release. Now its almost a complete game not a buggy beta.
---
Which is why I am asking what proof you would like, I am happy to provide you with proof once I know what proof you are looking for.
---
neat...
---
We have no problems killing her.   Lvl 113 here.  She glitched last night and we kept losing aggro.  Other than that, we have killed her several times since the patch with no issues.
---
Right but why not just de-list all of the items you have for sale.  It seems like a pretty straight forward solution...
---
-*slow clap*-
---
Neither LOTRO nor DDO had anywhere close to the amount of content at launch.
---
I found a 1 star guess rifle and turned it into scrip the other day.
---
Can you explain a bit better to what you mean.
---
Were you able to tell how the lvl of the item works at all? Will they always come out maxes?
---
That's you, IMO. I've been gaming since the 80s, I've played all of the Fallouts, and I think 76 is a great bit of fun. I'm over 700 hours in, and still love exploring.
---
*fat man with a piece of cake, tyvm.
---
Compared to fo76 launch?!? ROFL, you had more content in just the classes alone and all their skill trees and passives.
---
Could we just please use the welcome mats and direct where my potential customers will spawn? I 100% agree the default should be on the outer edge but it would be nice to have welcome mats serve a purpose for my home.
---
Weeks....... You mean months? Actually it's still happening. I know people who do it. So yeah
---
Thanks for the passive-aggressive response. Unfortunately I don't need to download this to know it won't be nearly as comprehensive as my maps are.
---
Fair enough. I also find that once the information is out there I want to know it because I don't want to be out of the loop. It does still feel fresh doing something in game vs just reading about it though
---
Yes, nearly constant with very few exceptions 
---
Usually better to be in a team
---
Just enjoy it, don't get super spun up about it like a lot of folks seem to do.
---
We'll pretend you did. Thanks!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmj7l3/we_now_know_what_nuclear_winter_is
---
not saying for... reasons. then again, any pvper worth their salt can probably guess.
---
point is, lots of new, unthinkable rolls show up everyday. in bulk. things like a nocturnal +per lead pipe. not really, but rolls that nobody thought to dupe 4 months ago.
---
how do you think that is?
---
You mean the classes that were completely broken, the skill trees that were unbalanced, and passives that often didn't work? Do you remember what it used to be like as a Captain or Burglar? Or that entire regions of the game had huge portions lacking quests?  Evendim and the Trollshaws, in particular.
---
I always cringe when I am about to jump but it is so awesome.
---
I thought it was playable but I just bought Rust recently and it is just everything done better. Its basically if fallout 76 wasnt total shit
---
Weapons that spawn with explosive perks laser Gauss Tesla plasma flamer cryolator
---
You can but pistols have no perks that add AA. Tank killer adds another 36% on top of the legendary affix.
---
Anecdotal.
---
Awesome PSA! Have an up!
---
9/10 would read again
---
ROFL, you think pointing out bugs is being negative. What a sad life you must have if you have to avoid any reality that involves issues that aren't perfect.
---
I wish I could do it, I'm on satellite and the darn quest pips don't load until my challenge time is half out. :(
---
You're right it is. But that's hard to do with 5 random players all going at your 3 machines so that you can't access them. It would be more convenient to just turn off access to them all with a switch.
---
I don’t give 2 shits. It’s a game for starters. Next it’s not real currency so it doesn’t matter to me and 3rd I’m now getting weapons and armor for CHEAP because of people “ fighting the system on the 10% tax because if I charge less they get less of my taxes” whatever dumbasses that’s not how that works but nonetheless it’s not a big deal like everyone is making it sound. If it was 100% perfect it would get old real quick IMO
---
not to mention dawn of war 3 relic studios - welp this is hard GLHF were keeping your money.....
---
Keep talking about what you think my life is, I know it helps you cope with yours!
---
Not to sound like a dick - but could you prove that? The data for these maps are literally ripped from the game files so I'd be interested to see how it missed one but got all the rest.
---
Yes, saying someone is delusional isn't calling them names. Do you even understand what "name calling" is? That would be me calling you an idiot, or a fool, not saying you are being delusional. One is a noun the other is an action.
---
Yeah I'm not going to do that.  Just walk!  Walking is fun!
---
I politely disagree. Swapping perks is a chore which I find very boring and adds nothing to the gameplay. I'm a level 160 and it takes a long time to scroll through all those perk cards.
---
I admit Perk cards themselves are a very interesting game mechanic. I enjoy the flexability but constantly swapping in lock picking, hacking and crafting perk cards gets old. If these perks were passive I'd have no problem with swapping cards because I'd rarely do it.
---
Still no evidences. Your evidences are based only on empty assumptions. FO76 has not improved much from the BETA and update after update Bethesda has failed to deliver any real fixes to core problems. If you really love this kind of game developing by saying it is impressive some how I pity those people who need to play such kind of games and pretend games are good.
---
I vote yes.
---
how so? top traders are still hoarding the good stuff and won't sell it to their mother for caps.
---
the game feels more "alive", more connected for better or worse, but the economy remains the same.
---
Idk. I just bought a 3 star bloodied explosive laser rifle that was probably duped during that brief 1 day public method the other day. Is that the one?
---
I could go back and gather every single embarrassing example you have given... but honestly, I don't care.
---
Thank you for your contribution to my post. Anything else you wanted to say, my friend?
---
Are you talking about fo76 or LotRO? Because either fits. Also the shire alone is a bigger zone than all of appilachia in fo76. nearly 5 times as many quests at launch.
---
#1 - they need to be placed carefully so players don't step on them, but punji boards save a lot of wandering mob damage. They attack those first, giving turrets time to kill them. And they are very cheap to repair.
---
fine. What I'm talking about then is ongoing advantages as in buffs/debuffs to stats
---
I was at max budget before they released vending. My walls are almost bare, I have to keep scrapping decorations to add anything else.
---
&gt;Player data
---
There's the issue.
---
To expand on what megakuigi said, there are new machines at train stations that are "legendary exchange terminals." You feed unwanted legendary items into it and get somewhere between 3-40 "legendary scrip" in exchange. When the new legendary mole miner vendor appears next week you'll be able to exchange the scrip for a random legendary item with the number of starts of your choosing. 
---
More details here: https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bml10l/inside_the_vault_the_purveyor/
---
I have been in my workshop and suddenly nerd rage goes off.. no movement and I lost life. And no I didn’t have any diseases. Game is just buggy.
---
The game is still loading at that point, as soon as the world somewhat loads just haul ass, then turn around and watch the camp load up. I do this at my own camp sometimes just because I'm lazy and don't want to open my door lol
---
That's fine, friend. You are entitled to your opinion, even if it's wrong.
---
The evidences are there for those not blinded by hate.
---
It was Herd Mentality, I somehow got the mutation and didn't know it because of a new bug where it doesn't show up
---
LOTS of it
---
Agreed, there's a 100 variables that could have been at play.
---
That sucks I googled Dick Johnson and there is a ton of people by that name. RIP Long Dick Johnson you will be missed.
---
Sorry you feel that way, since the release of player vending I've found really good deals for really good weapons. Paid 10k for a 3* AAE Handmade just yesterday.
---
By economy I mean more the influx/use of caps. Before, I always felt like I was close enough to max caps that they never really mattered. Now I feel like there's something to spend them on and that I'm also getting a more regular amount of income from the legendary farming I usually do. After my 10k purchase yesterday, I'm already close to max again.
---
Youre lucky. Some of our camps (mine) are bugged and cant remove floors or stairs
---
Ask Todd for a raise, you need it after all the bootlicking in here! :P
---
You're saying that its ok to be buttfucked by a company as long as they put some misc shit in it.
---
"Impressive amount of work" lol, gtfo.
---
I'm sorry it didn't work out for you.
---
Enjoy Rust!
---
My solution to the terrible quality was to just install the imgur app, instead of using it from my phone browser. After that they all looked great :)
---
Actually YOU are the one who said said MMO. 76 is as much of a MMO as these, which is why I'm comparing them.
---
Yeah its a day one glitch where when you spawn in , for some reason or another, it loads in you and your inventory separately or something akin to that.
---
Occasionally if you have any technical data in your inventory it will load on the ground. The glitch is strictly visual and shouldn’t ( at least before the latest patch not sure about now) have any affect on your actual inventory.
---
Basically imagine its a spawn icon that just happens to look and act like technical data.  No affect on personal play just weird visual/load style glitch
---
It was the first course I ran. lol
---
I'm guessing you haven't played LOTRO extensively; the Shire is in no way, shape, or form, "a bigger zone than all of Appalachia." Not even close. Try walking from end to end sometime.   
---
As for the number of quests, you realize that the majority of those quests were "kill 5 rats", right?
---
I mean going by that claim then you are the one going around calling people names. You were the one who started calling people names then by claiming they are "salty". 
---
Why do you have such an emotional reaction to people pointing out the issues with this game? It is really weird.
---
I will, thank you.
---
Sorry that you feel the need to cry about a videogame, though.
---
I'm more inclined the reason we don't have it yet is simply because Bethesda is lazy, or it's very low on the priority list.  And possibly they're both lazy, and it's low on the priority list.  I was skeptical reading about that thing too, so I didn't take it as fact, but it was merely speculation I had seen floating around.
---
That’s exactly what I’ve seen this whole post. The OP can’t defend his opinion, so he resorts to calling people salty and emotionally broken.
---
I don’t get how he wants people to take him seriously when he responds so childishly to criticism. He can’t even come up with a good rebuttal other than “Well, that’s your opinion, man”.
---
What if instead of doing an entire search (and allow everyone to do so) you add the map images you already have (and some that other could ask for) to an app or webpage that has them all? Of course this will not allow users to search specific things but having access to the maps you already downloaded on an app or website is useful enough until you find a better way. I think it is a good way to solve it in the meanwhile, I would 10/10 use it.
---
Sky bases off a cliff are purely for cool factor.  
---
the ones that hover above a single foundation are because they are easy to place when moved. Some people prefer a base you drop right where you need it most rather than a forever home in a single spot.
---
Dude it's not that hard to post "proof" if you have it. You're such a unique troll, you are acting like a tard on purpose. Interesting approach

I have all the receivers so idc what it has. 
---
As for price I've seen 3 star hunting rifle since player vending in the 1500 to 2000 range which i would pay for what I specifically want
---
The two things I would love to see are spawns for apparel, and for random events.
---
10-4
---
some will say that it is, but no, not really. especially now with the sen/cav nerf and how damage is calculated in pvp.
---
BE laser rifles have also been duped to hell for a while now, ever since the TSE nerf. everyone moved to bloodied builds and naturally, dupers followed suit.
---
That's a good play on words wish I thought of it
---
I see.
---
Yea I plan to cover that, iffy though since although it is under Bethesda's umbrella its one of their smaller regional offices. Still bad but more of like a contained bad I suppose
---
4Go out of the 669mo from the game database?
---
that seems... odd
---
They could just set it so the mats can only be put on the ground and not on or in buildings.
---
Did you both find the quest?
---
sadly i dont have that yet.
---
I have had to delete a lot of decorations cause the vending machines
---
Thank you. i will live on in another game lol
---
"Not saying for reasons" means "I'm full of shit"
---
Sounds like you need to improve with those anger issues still.
---
I don't care about your life, I just find your actions in this thread hilarious and kind of pathetic. First you tried to claim I was the one with the sad life, now when I say the same things to you its different. 
---
You didn't even realize I'm literally using your own comments you've said to me and returning them to you and you are getting upset about them. Why are you so emotional? You should stop being so hysterical and calm down.
---
But they are still good for PvP regardless of the dupers right?
---
Haven't noticed a difference.
---
Oh gotcha
---
None of the specific insurance neither my camper other people's camp or static spawns at Rivers stations will work. Also none of the nukashinw instruments will work.
---
A LOT more stuff was datamined, including the dialogue for Vault 51 and nuclear winter, and more notes regarding to it
---
That moment when OP is more of an asshole than the other guy.
---
A decently sized squad of people doing god knows how little DPS on the Queen and not buggering around with adds or in their pip boys or trying to take pictures of stingwings for challenges.
---
I do a ton of DPS in the queen fight, and I end up with groups of people that can't pull their weight all the time.
---
more than 1 foundation makes moving it hard. The more foundations, the harder to move. Most just do a single foundation and a stair up, and build the rest from there.

No, I'm wanting to know exactly what you want the proof of so that when I give it you can't try to weasel out of it saying "that isn't proof". So once you give me concrete what you would accept as proof I will be glad to give it to you.
---
Linked a PDF with questions and answers for those unable to use the site.
---
(FYI - ads are how websites stay in business. Like websites that list tutorials and answers and guides.... Might consider allowing ads and let them get their revenue...beside, you don't have to click the ads it just shows them on the page - just my 2 cents)
---
Anyone know of reviews of the game in its current state? I want to see if it’s worth the purchase for me yet.
---
By the way you keep talking about it, it really leaves a different impression.
---
Oh, don't worry friend. I'm not upset. I'm here to help you cope with your frustrations, nothing more. I'm just a vessel for your anger and bitterness.
---
Dude...the people with 400k caps, play the game totally different. If caps are your objective, and you focus your time and character around merchant related activities, it's totally possible.
---
Hell, I used to "play" the auction house in WoW back in burning crusade for a few hours a day. On a good day I could pull 50k to 100k gold. And back then, sitting on 5k was alot.
---
The bulb letters are atom shop, yeah. Same font as the friends welcome sign, but it's a full set of letters. You can open the atom shop itself and find them under camp stuff, or under the build menu category of Wall Decor, near the bottom of the list
---
Yeah, as annoying as the tasks are, the payoff is worth it IMO.
---
&gt;Yeah, and you can do the same with PC
---
Console fallout doesn't have a built in chat, but you can do it by *directly* using their fallout name. Spinning circles here Agammamon.
---
I might have one you can have I'll have to check
---
Nice, even better now. :)
---
Since it's inconsistent with how all of the other damage increases interact, maybe that additive damage is a bug they're unaware of.  Not a lot of people are actually meticulous enough to calculate exactly how they interact with each other, even I didn't realize that until I checked out your code.
---
why wouldn't they be? dupes work the same as "real" rolls. in fact, if it wasn't for dupers, you'd **never** have a BE laser rifle. literally.
---
but BE specifically is better for pve now.
---
It is a sight to behold.
---
I'll see your yes and raise it another yes my friend
---
I don't think your quirk is quite working out here lol
---
While I agree that there is some great deals to be had and some have overpriced their stuff; the market will stabilize over time and prices will level out. I think that a lot of players have not been active in any of the trading platforms (myself included) to see what items are going for in those markets. I'm sure that I've sold several items too cheap according to some of the other markets; I had a vendor that came and bought several items and put them in his vending machine, which I'm totally fine with. We have one large open market now which everyone can be involved in if they want too. I guess what it comes down to is simply "supply and demand".  
---
With all the new vendors maybe some items won't be as hard to get as in the past. You throw in the legendary vendor into all of this and we'll see what kind of wildcard it throws into the pricing.
---
Not the best combo tbh.
---
Pistols shine with vats but vats eats fusion cores fast in PA due to the ap drain.
---
Have you done no PA before?  While leveling you'll use it regardless but once you finalize a vats/pistol build you can ditch the PA
---
This is so cool, I can’t wait to look more into this as I travel myself! I don’t play as often as I’d like to so most of the time I forget where I find things. Thank you :)
---
WTF are you on about?
---
if you say so. like I said, any half-decent pvper can guess. I traded one a few days ago.
---
don't want Bethesda going and nerfing the shit out of them, although it's probably only a matter of time.
---
Then they aren’t literally mandatory but they’re extremely helpful and there’s no downside stat wise.
---
You are probably right.
---
I had that a bunch of times at the Camp Venture course. The first couple times, the pips and timer never appeared at all and then the sound at the speaker wouldn’t even play, and then when it was working and the pips were there I kept having to double back to see if I missed any or if it was just lag on the sound.
---
Literally suggested this earlier this week and no one bats an eye. I'd like to know what sells and for what. This data could lead to new suggested prices.
---
The game should run two checks.
---
First,  is the area clear of constructs.
---
Second will the spawn in be on solid ground.
---
If the answer to both is yes then that’s where the spawn in should happen.
---
My squad killed her in 7min 23 sec yesterday, I don’t think they did
---
How big are your camp builds to use ALL of the budget, I have a pretty well decorated camp and it's at 50-60%.
---
Don't worry, I'm here to help you vent your frustrations, friend.
---
Tell me more.
---
I gave up about 3/4 through it. Side note of interest: the picnic area nearby, wooden pathway to the gazebo and the gazebo is claimable camp land, if anyone wants a scenic view
---
I'm on now. Happy to help if I can revive you in return psn tracerbullet53
---
I read you.
---
&gt;Possum vendor
---
Do you mean that Vending Machine at the Pioneer Scout Camp? I've check it but didn't see any mod for backpack.
---
Copy that.
---
# “FIST” #
---
Maybe try punctuation and sentences?  I'm not trying to be a jerk - but I'd like to know what you are talking about.
---
Its still entirely viable of course. Tbh outside of pvp there's no real difference.
---
I bet pistols and the ammo they use might tip the "maintenance" factor to pistols.
---
My rifle build uses alot of .45 and .308 but i can't really carry more than 2 rifles due to weight so I've settled on that combo
---
Sadly I think it is a symptom of a much larger problem in the culture of the whole zenimax umbrella. To maximize profit with as little effort as possible, be it from overpriced skins in the Atom shop ported from fallout 4, the abhorrent microtransaction crap they are pulling with Blades, and fallout 76 are all larger symptoms to a much bigger issue inside the company.
---
I have a feeling it is going to get far worse before it gets better after seeing the effort a small minority of players in this community will go through to excuse bethesda's actions, to the point I'm wondering if they might be part of a PR team in this subreddit trying to steer the conversation.
---
Oof
---
Good, good.
---
r/woooosh
---
Yet you still won't tell me what you will accept as proof, wonder why that is? Not scared are you?
---
Yeah ok you are a hero.
---
&gt; My choice is to be positive
---
Except your responses to a lot of other people in this thread come across like a smart ass teenager talking. With comments like "that's fine, put your salt on me, I'm here to help friend" - the fact that you don't understand how condescending and annoying comments like that are tells me you don't understand the statement "my choice is to be positive".
---

As great as it sounds, I think an auction house would destroy the current economy. At the moment, player vending requires folks to visit each vendor location. An auction house would centralize this and de-incentivize player vending at their camps. Why spend the caps and effort to visit everyone when I could just go to one place? Why put something on a vending machine in my camp if no one visits because of an auction house and I could actually make more caps if someone got into a bidding war? 
---
Furthermore, because of the cap limit, each auction house purchase would have to cap out at 25K. Anything beyond that would be lost. The trading community often makes deals that bypass this limit through the use of mule. Because of the current limitations, I don't see them using the auction house much for these big deals either.
---
Last NIght I felt a bit guilty ..... decided to do a last minute fly through a couple player/vendors camps before logging off.  Ran In.  Ran Out.  Looked at nothing.  DIdn’t wave.  Sorry!  Shopping!  Gotta run .....  Fast Travel Gone.
---
Thought about it after ...... I really appreciate when the player is home, so I can see all the perks on a weapon/armour .... love for players to stick around and look at my own camp .... they buy more when I’m home too (probably because they can see what I’m selling better)
---
Gotta remember to be friendly ....... note to self.
---
This is a really good tool that you made. Keep up the good work!
---
I'll roll with you on PC if you want.  Where are you in the main questline?
---
Are you feeling better now, friend? Or do you really need to keep going with your childish back and forth?
---
This isn't primary school anymore, sweetheart.
---
Is "keep crying" your default response? Pretty weak. I mean, I gave you the comparison to GGG, a indie company. Go check how many full blown expansions they released for free in the last couple of years.
---
And then tell me Bethesda put any amount of love into this game. 
---
If you do, I'm sorry, but you're delusional. But hey, heres to hopping for new ideas. Bethesda sure needs them.
---
i think you need to read it for it to count
---
Don't do it
---
And it's also dirt cheap to repair and "good enough" for pretty much anything.
---
I was having this issue last night. Had to get right under them and spam RT but eve actually it would hit.
---
Without a mount running? Takes 14 minutes. Same for Appalachia? 11 minutes.
---
&gt;As for the number of quests, you realize that the majority of those quests were "kill 5 rats", right?
---
So were quite a few of the quests in FO76. "Go kill evan in the basement", go kill 3 different types of animals", "shoot 3 different animals with this gun", etc.
---
Good question... I've wondered the same thing. One person told me that the number meant "# of nodes#, but that makes no sense, as there's no way I've ever found 3 oil seeps, or 3 copper seams in a single workshop.
---
They just make new accounts, Bethesda needs to fix it. I don't even play anymore. I used to dupe when I did play I had like 25 accounts all with a few of every item, made $1000's on eBay. They would ban one account I'd dupe another and make a new back up account. I don't play or dupe or sell anymore but that's the process... They can ban all they want it will never stop the problem, as long as you can crash a server you can dupe and the servers are easy to crash
---
Same. I’m not fussed if no one wants to buy my plans, I want them to enjoy my lore-friendly mire build.
---
Gorge is special as there's a large water purifier in the puddle out front near the mountain side. Just needs power.
---
Normally food indicates there's plants in the area you can harvest and water shows the amount of "supply" you can tap into with your own built purifiers.
---
Edit: actually I'm not sure if that water point is true. I think it might just indicate water sources.
---
oh I did. All 5 grognak magazines.
---
The irony is almost... too perfect, isn't it?
---
Everyone should try it instead, it's basically everything done better and way better devs that update more often and with better QoL focus
---
I've been told is how FAST those workshops produce food, I've also heard that that's the default food in those areas.
---
It is a bug. When the owner isnt at the CAMP, the server unloads their Stash data to save memory... but that means it cant retrieve from that data when another player tries to inspect.
---
lol calm down bud sorry I took it literally
---
Idk Man I wasn’t going for the Confederacy but now everyone is commenting Confederacy so...

---
It takes 21 minutes, not 11 minutes.  Also, given that everyone is mounted in LOTRO, you should compare it that way. And most of that space in LOTRO is barren and empty, with no clutter, no random buildings, relatively few crafting nodes, few randomly lootable objects, etc.  It's a pretty poor comparison, actually, it really just highlights how much more there is in 76.
---
I'd go as far as to say my brahmin has died more in the past 3 days by players than my DS has in the 200+ hours I've played since December. lol
---
I tried it, and it wasn't really for me.
---
But I'm glad that you enjoy it!

No dude, you're just not reading them.

It's also handy for bloodbugs and bloat flies if chasing the Sting n Things task.

---
well, owning the dolly sods campground IS a weekly challenge. other than that, I dont know why.  
---
or know any other of your question's answers.
---
I think what’s currently in place is a great experience and fits with the world as a whole. There are great items to be found at CAMPs, which can make visiting as many as possible very rewarding. It makes the world feel lived in and interesting. I fear that creating a place like this would work against that.
---
happy cake day!  but im on xbox :(
---
Freedom! Reminds me of the Scottish flag.
---
Where are you getting 669MB for the game? It installs to 61.1GB
---
Then dump it in overseers crates at overseer camp or flatwoods.  Stuff added to those becomes common loot.
---
Yeah, pretty sure you can trade them between people that already have the quest, but people that haven't found the tourist yet can't seem to. From what I've read around the forums anyway.
---
Uh, no I was responding to the person saying that many MMO's came out with less content than fo76, so I asked them which MMO's. Nowhere did I say fo76 was an MMO.
---
I picked one up earlier myself, very high quality, won't be disappointed!
---
It’s supposed to be based more on the Scottish flag because “freedooom!”
---
Hey, I live in the eastern time zone, Friday nights I'm usually on (I promise I'm not as lame as that makes me sound.) If your on tonight my guy is in the 150 ish level and we could team up to knock out some of the tandem tadpole quests or nuke some stuff. Let me know psn is Onepompousa55
---
There's this guy called DoubleTheFun on reddit. I've been fucking his mom and I just found out he's autistic. What should I do?
---
These are good points, I agree 100% 
---
Assuming cap limit changes and a limit to how many items you could put in the auction house, you think it would be feasible?
---
That way the auctions can play out effectively and people still have a reason to go to player vending since there can't be too many items in the AH.
---
Man I just find that impossible to believe
---
r/notevenalittle
---
Oh, mom and "u autistic" jokes!
---
I really liked those when I was twelve too!
---
You have saved my sanity, and my marriage!
---
I think this is fair for sure. 
---
What if you limited the number of items in the AH to ensure people still have a reason to visit player camps?
---
I tried doing the camp venture one...unless it’s something else and not the real course set up...
---
hmm havent heard or been to that place I dont think....where on the map?
---
Sorry, maybe I'm misunderstanding your comment but that's what [this album](https://imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY) is for, no?
---
Not scared at all, just wondering why a man with supposed "proof" won't post it at all. Truly a mystery
---
r/okay
---
Looks like Bethesda is now accelerating their copy-paste developing. Not only objects, but also stories are copied.

My camp has a bunch of instruments outside near the vending machine, so there's a chance you could spawn in and hear banjos.
---
No, most people aren't mounted in the shire, as it is low level area and the mounts aren't cheap. Also, did you even watch the video you linked? Half the time he isn't even running straight towards the other side of the map. Sure if I zigzagged on LotRO I could get 20+ minutes to cross the shire as well. The dude even goes into lakes and swims through them super slow...
---
I'm talking straight line without sidetracking, it takes 11 minutes from deathclaw island to get across through the toxic valley to past abbys bunker in 11 minutes.
---
You think?
---
I think they would have been attacked and maligned no matter when they released FO76...those that just want a single player FO and those that want an FONV clone would have been outraged and triggered regardless.  These folks like to think that they are "purests" but they are not, by a long shot. NV is nothing like the original, nor should it have been! I've enjoyed every FO, at the time they were released and I like the progression that has occurred.  Everyone of them has been memorable, both for good and bad aspects, and I have no regrets giving my money for them. That includes FO76...maybe even especially 76, as I wasn't sure if it was going to be for me.
---
 I'd never played an online game or a multiplayer game until 76. I too was a game "purest". Silly, ignorant me...but at least ignorance is curable,  stupid is for life. I'm somewhat embarrassed to say that I've got a bit over 700 hours into 76 now. I am still enjoying myself and I've learned to play nice with others...who says that you can't teach an old dog a  new trick!
---
You still crying that this game bombed?
---
It is what it is, my friend.
---
Dont think so. I play on xbox and you're only entitled to farm a spot once every 12-24 hours i believe? So they will disappear before your eyes and then respawn again after set amount of time.
---
It's all good hopefully we can catch each other online later
---
There is a active dupe glitch that is similar to a previously known one, it is much easier than the one that was just shut down.  Bethesda has effectively closed the same loophole previously, so most of the people duping are staying quiet this time.   It's the source of most of the items you are seeing in trader section now.  The one patched had just made it to Youtube but it was known for weeks before that, it itself was similar how Treasure Map method had worked.  There a couple other ones you can do that are not as controllable that pertain to pickup from shared containers or super fast transfer of items.
---
Us: Real valid arguments on the mistakes of Bethesda and the misleading recent controversy in game - how that all ties together.

OP: *AUTISTIC SCREECHING*
---
I still haven’t finish launching a nuke if you’d want to run one with me or just do anything really 🤷‍♂️ 
---
Psn is yoraeh
---
I legit thought Royal Jelly was bugged and just not properly in the game. Thanks for this. Been looking to make blackberry honey crisp since fucking beta.
---
I met a guy who liked to keep people hostage in his house
---
You find the expectation of receiving a feature-complete, functioning product, when paying full price for it first-hand, embarrassing? I mean, I don't mind positivity, but you labeling me as negative is, in itself, scary. Because I'm just being realistic.
---
Yeah. I never thought you were. I like the flag and I'd like to see it in my camp. I think people are too sensitive sometimes.
---
Haha.
---
Where do you find the plan to build that anyways sorry for askin fairly new to fo76
---
It was set to 10 minutes on December 4th, however after everyone bitched &amp; moaned (rightly so) they increased the timer to 30 minutes.
---
Mounts are trivially cheap, and most people get them well before you've finished all the content in the Shire.
---
You literally cannot go in a straight line across in either game though the complete lack of any serious terrain or elevation differences in many of the zones in LOTRO, makes it far easier  
---
Edit: Also Deathclaw Island to Toxic Valley isn't even "across the map." you're leaving out huge portions, and the playable map is taller than it is long.  Try going from the top left corner, past Point Pleasant, to bottom right corner.
---
You don't right now.
---
I'm not a man, I'm a woman. I'm offering the proof as soon as you tell me what you will accept as proof. I've run into too many people on this site that will ask for proof and as soon as you give them proof they claim it isn't proof and try to move the goalposts.
---
So now I make sure they tell me what they will accept as proof so I don't waste my time giving them proof they will just ignore because it proves them wrong.
---
It's so scary that I don't think I will sleep tonight.
---
If you fast travel to Dryer chemical you have to then turn left and go to 65 on the road on the map. It’s a random encounter so if it’s enemies server hop. It did take me a while to get her and she may just have the plan for the hat and not the costume.
---
I’m doing an RP version of this with my hunter/tracker character I’m currently levelling. Documenting his experience during his first fights with every cryptid and large enemy in the game as well as providing a screenshot of me posing with the kill.
---
I’ve found it best not to click on clickbait articles, like the internet historian stuff from awhile back.
---
These people are trying to make money off outrage, both from those that love to bash the game, and those that enjoy the game and are clicking to see what all the fuss is.
---
Best tactic: don’t click at all, don’t give these people money.  Play what you like.

This is a textbook case of Stockholm Syndrome.

Okay.
---
Maybe try your sniper again - I play a sneak sniper as well and I break line of sight just fine with crouching - and i can literally run in circles around enemies and not be detected because of running.
---
Could have fooled me, you definitely seem upset, as a calm person doesn't respond back with "your just salty" at every single person who says anything about the game that isn't glowing praise.
---
Why would I be frustrated or angry or bitter? That doesn't even make sense. You do realize this is just a video game right? How well it does doesn't matter to your life nor mine. Lighten up and stop whining so much when someone calls out something you like.
---
Yes. But having it on an app or website aside from an imgur album makes it more accessible for users outside reddit. It could be, for example, at the Fo76 wiki.
---
So that doesn't work either?
---
Bethesda will nerf it is a lame excuse.
---
&gt;What I'm saying is that there should be more of an even spread (distribution) throughout the different effects and in general I don't see that.
---
What I really meant by this is ... if the mechanism is *supposed to be* truly unweighted RNG then what I observed actually contradicts this. I just worded it poorly, and I apologise for the ambiguity.
---
I agree that its beneficial to have a certain amount of RNG, and that the weighting within that RNG does give the player a better chance to get a top tier weapon or armor piece in comparison to having a system that relies upon totally unweighted RNG. But getting back to the issue with the Purveyor, its how that weighted RNG is going to be applied. What will it be based upon? As there is no legendary enemy, area to spawn that enemy etc, what is a **reasonable** method of doing this? They have to cater for many types of player and still ensure that hardcore players (with multiple accounts), who are looking for loopholes and ways to effectively break the game, don't achieve their aims. I expect them to be cautious, but I think they need to give the average player a good chance of getting something useful (but not god-roll) to play with or resell to others. All this hype will create a backlash if they don't get this right (ie. if they do give players exactly the same trashy 2 and 3 star weapons/armor they scrapped in the first place). If only they had created new events or challenges with better rewards instead of this legendary recycling.
---
that is bogus. mustve been a decision made by someone not familiar with the character. :(
---
There's 2 separate vending machines.  Tadpole and possum.  You'll need some possum badges for the mods though
---
That's slightly unsettling, only a little tho.
---
You have problem to read facts over your imagination?
---
Awesome work thanks!
---
Sounds like your camp is parked on Obvious Choice Hill
---
I'm so excited lol
---
This as well as a picture of a bee swarm. There's a beehive on the backside of the shack on the hill by the pumpkin patch. 
---
Also, Campfire Tales is where I do most of my bug collecting. All you have to do is pick up wet kindling instead of dry and it spawns 3-5 misc. bugs.
---
Fantastic, can't wait to see more.
---
Question: Flavor_Any what is this exactly? 
---
Suggestion: More cooking maps.  I saw you had Royal Jelly on the list already but there are some other ingredients I didn't notice yet. Forgive me if I overlooked them in the lists already.
---
Eggs: mothman, mirelurk, deathclaw, radscorpion
---
Honey (or beehives)
---
Sugar Bombs
---
Glowing Resin
---
Also for fun and profit can critters be tracked?  Cat, Chicken, Fox, Rabbit and Squirrels.  All great meat to use but much harder to find than normal creatures.
---
Okey there is a bug, if you delete your character, your character will no longer be exist.
---
yeah no dice
---
how cheap?  i have marsupial and herd mentality
---
ROFL, you can check my post history. If you can't accept that a woman actually plays video games you must be one of those incel basement dwellers.
---
 Hate to burst your bubble, but not only do we play games, but some of us even make mods for them, and even worked on game development themselves...

Another minor thing I noticed... The Two Shot prefix seems to be truncating the decimal of the damage. Stock 50cal, 43 base damage. 25% damage increase, so should be 53.75 but 53.00 is displayed instead. Maybe has to do with the calc needing to be a bit odd since it has to go off of the base damage instead of the damage with mods?
---
I checked a few other prefixes and they were fine and including places after the decimal.
---
If you've used mods on PC, you may have to check your .ini file.
---
thanks, are both machines at the same place?
---
People tend to missinform. The skins they showed were concept art. Meaning they weren't all implemented.
---
Edit: They also say in the article that they all didn't make it in.
---
Jeez-o whys it got to be so hard
---
5 caps. Take it or leave it.
---
Really you should try this and show me proof
---
Yeah I send a complaint instead with links to the wiki on him, my ticket that allowed the name change, and how that name is actually a name used in  many games. I have a wow character with that name from when I use to play for example.
---
Do you?
---
Yes Whitesprings golf club was really dark for me yesterday.
---
Nice arguing with you. I can tell that you're very eloquent and convincing. I can't possibly come back from that.
---
It just works!
---
Okay what? I'm seriously asking what good work have they done?
---
You know - I think I've cracked it. If you look *reeeally* closely at Camp Venture, there is a marker for a NukaCola. The bottom left edge of that marker is just a little bit bigger than it should be. That's it. The marker is basically entirely covered by another one. (presumably they're directly above or next to each other). I suppose that's highlighted a bit of a weakness with Mappalachia.
---
*As a follow-up, would a map of just Hallucigen canisters be useful to you?
---
Best part of this update is making the game actually feel like an mmo
---
so its way harder?
---
Just to the left of fort defiance
---
You were just unlucky with the people that joined.  Trust me level 100,even 150 is still in the noob zone when it comes to gear.
---
I've seen 2 lvl 130 owned at 1st wolf attack in the event "free range" because their weapons were just trash.  Those who play organically can even reach lvl 200 without a good melee or explosive gun.
---
theve added vending machines 
---
theve nerfed tse
---
power armor is still meh
---
more camp build limit 
---
some new quests have been added
---
Soon private servers will be added
---
Fun things
---
making disabled ghouls
---
If you pull up the resource tab in the build menu you can look around and look for the green semitransparent place where the extractor can go.
---
That’s how I’ve always looked for the resource points.
---
You need to see the bigger picture in all of this! Come on, put that brain of yours to work!
---
:))))
---
So if someone else farms a spot does that mean the items wont return for 12-24 items for me? or is that wait time only if I myself farm that spot?
---
Look man, you don't have proof otherwise you would've posted it already. It's ok to be wrong but to lie to others about it is on the Critical yikes scale
---
Nope, I'm not okey with bugs.. :(
---
yes because this sub's bitching didn't end up with them nerfing tse. or sen/cav.
---
So why haven’t the data miners found  all these things before? Why do they only find new future content after a patch ? You sound dumb
---
Sounds like it's time for the Vim Rocketeer and Nuka Girl flying in to save the day
---
Awh okai
---
You play it daily yet you only have negative things to say about it? Shit doesn't add up, dude. Maybe it's time to start appreciating what is good about the game, since it's clearly good enough to keep your interest. And to top it off, you can't even bother to offer constructive negative comments, they're just unintelligent jabs at the game.
---
No u.
---
For real, people can't even agree tax is good IRL where it actually funds development. These just disappear into nothingness 0 benefit. Fast traveling to player vendors is a better tax.
---
True, they nerfed Two shots pretty hard recently 
---
Also, whatever people want, they are going to get by buying it anyways, I just want the Purveyor to be more useful than farming 3 stars at Whitesprings
---
I wish hahah
---
What the FUCK
---
I found serums for sale at camp vendors for 200 caps frequently this week.
---
Reading is hard.
---
&gt;Also Deathclaw Island to Toxic Valley isn't even "across the map." you're leaving out huge portions, and the playable map is taller than it is long. Try going from the top left corner, past Point Pleasant, to bottom right corner.
---
Well if you want to do that, then might as well do that with the shire as well. As I was only going across it, not diagonally to get it to 15 minutes to cross. From corner to corner, it would probably be nearly double that. On top of the fact, that even if the shire itself isn't bigger than all of Appalachia that is only one area of the map on LotRO, there are still dozen others that are just as large or larger. So it is 10 times larger than fo76.
---
 Rifle for semi auto and Automatic for full Auto receivers
---
The cheapest one I got was 150 caps but usually it's 5000 to 25000 caps lol
---
Actually, Str 15 helps melee.  What you dont have yet are the perk cards to utilize the currently unused points.  (I made a similar mistake - more points that I had cards.
---
You can select any category other than strength to add a point, then pick an available card from whatver Str cards you have in your draw pile.
---
Of course, that wil leave you with an unused point in a different category -
---
Short story is it can be fixed, but It will take you a bunch more levels to do it.
---
You may also want to check your armor stats and chem perks.  Some of them will add points to a given special.  If your armor is +X Str, try unequipping before selecting a card.  IF you have a chem buff, you'll have to wait out the timer.
---
That sounds pretty fun
---
K.
---
They are back to back.
---
Lololol. No way! But ehm 400atoms yaáay
---
Glad I could help you find the issue and hopefully you fixed it! :)
---
Yes. I believe they are also at all the pioneer scout related camps. I usually just go to where you join the scouts.  The machines are placed back to back
---
Im not "whining" I am suggesting, so if you don't like it, you can get lost as your opinion is meaningless
---
If you are dyselectic, then yes 😂 plz dont judge me 😳
---
I do have proof, I'm just wanting you to tell me what you will accept as proof, so I can get that exact proof so you can't weasel out of it.
---
Why can't you tell me exactly what you would accept for proof, if you are so sure I couldn't give you the proof?
---
Don't lie to me
---
i really hate how difficult the challenges are, these seem like they should be for opossum scouts with more time
---
What is this... a font for ANTS?!?
---
They already are proud. They don't have to tie their self worth to this game like you do where you can't even accept people having issues with the bugginess and shady actions by bethesda.
---
Why is it you are so thin skinned you can't even deal with people calling out their shady practices and buggy games?
---
Nah, never done PA. Kind of looking for a good build with PA. Guess I’ll do PA/2H build. That’s pretty much the go to PA build right? 
---
Ammo management with heavy weapons seems like it would be an annoyance. At least at low levels ammo is annoying to manage. Is that the case end game too?
---
Blegh! Not my style personally. That said the last update was amazing but I'm avoiding data mines in the future. So, so many cool things in the last one I want, like the new backpacks, flowers, cacti--two updates in and I'm already impatient. Next time I'd rather be pleasantly surprised than frustrated at how they deliver this content piecemeal.
---
Lol, I just said I don't play anymore.... My wife would kill me if I started playing fallout again. That game almost ruined our relationship, it was a full time job.
---
Where in my post am I asking for 3 star god rolls?  Did you read my post?  (i doubt it)
---
I am asking to be able to pay EXTRA for 1 star of our choosing and the base item, not all 3 stars 
---
I cannot believe people bother to post without even reading the OP 
---
If you want to pay 100 scrip for a garbage 3 star rolling pin, fill your boots, I on the other hand want a bit more value for my precious time.
---
Unfortunately if someone farms that spot you’d have to wait that set amount of time. It’s a first come first serve. But don’t quote me on that because that’s just based on what I’ve experienced since playing this game from day one. I farm for a lot of lead and plastic too and once the spot has been farmed, it’s gone. No matter how many times I server hop, I just have to wait.
---
Can’t wait for the posts trying to police proper purveyor etiquette.
---
Because if I do you will say it isn't proof, that is why I'm asking you what you will accept as proof. A link to what? a video of the datamine files? A link to a website with screenshots of the files? Or does ti have to be a news site reporting it?
---
I died of dehydration while doing the Tadpole Scout knowledge exams. Looking forward to dying again when it's time to take the Possum Scout exams.
---
Hahaha that's wild... thanks for looking into it. I wouldn't be opposed to a map of Hallucigen Canisters and Stealth Boys for producing Phantom Devices.
---
i remember farming wood for hours at the sawmill. server switching over and over again.
---
this will make it a lot easier. thanks. keep up your great work.
---
It can drop from the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Why be a cunt in your own thread?
---
Paragraph 1 is a conjecture.  Paragraph 2 is real, verifiable information which can be cross-checked by information contained in this sub.  Paragraph 3 is a brief narrative generalizing the perceived events.
---
Ya they max at 40 for *no* apparent reason
---
Weird
---
Nice try FBI
---
You obviously haven't checked my post history, I've numerous times offered ways they could fix the shit. Hell I've even offered to give them my mods I've made that fixed crashes and bugs.
---
You are barking up the wrong tree with that claim you just made.
---
I was editing the post to add the bit about armor/chems when you replied.  
---
Perhaps those are affecting your numbers?
---
I am expecting big crowds if just the 1 vendor, with ppl just spamming the button to access her hahaha. Especially since a lot of ppl will be loading up on scrips, gonna be long wait times at the vendor for sure
---
I jist got a 1☆ Bloodied Mole miner Gauntlet. Seeing as you run a Bloodied build is it any good?
---
&gt;If they walked away no one would have ever trusted another Fallout game from them.
---
Naw, be honest... we would have wailed and bitched and swore up and down we'd never touch another thing from Bethesda,  but the reality is that within 6 months we would have rationalized it and even started to praise them for being "brave enough " to walk away. Especially once the FO was announced.  We'd give them  "one more chance" and so on. Go on, admit it, this is a judgment free zone (and if you believe that, I've got this simply amazing 5 star,furious, triple shot, quad, explosive with faster fire rate to sell you!). 😂😆
---
Having said all that, don't take me wrong, I've put over 700 hours into 76 and I still play it, at least a bit, daily. I'm right there beside you all, going down that famous river, Da Nile! 
---
Cheers!!
---
Does it really hurt you that much to give back to someone who just wants a straight answer without shuffling through a shit storm of posts?
---
This is a legendary post. Thank you so much for your effort. You've done something really incredible here!
---
Players can already choose their reward by BUYING any items they want from other players (in fact almost all my best stuff came from purchases, NOT legendary drops, and it appears unless they slightly improve the Purveyor, that will not change)
---
They'll add in a mini camp version that spouts his phrases when clicked
---
They have, why do you think they know the exact types of Zetans that are going to be added in winter wasteland, or knew about the sheepsquatch, and backpacks...
---
I hear Mini nukes can be effective on crowds
---
People can only have 1k scrip though, so I kind of doubt people will take super long.
---
Unless they're just butts and sit in the menu.
---
I don’t want to seem rude by stopping you whenever you reply, but, you’re wrong again. As much as I would love that to be true, it’s not. It’s broken.
---
oh thats why.  yes, never been there.  thanks for the heads up though
---
I actually had a plan to do something like this but also including things like event trigger areas, npc spawn locations, quest triggers, special item drops. I want to be able to find as much information as I can lol
---
This is how that shit happen to exist.
---
Good for your wife, she sounds like a smart lady. You don't need to play the game to report dupers.
---
Well mole rats will burrow inside anyways, ain't no stopping that without building a floating house lol
---
So....everything.....
---
Biodegradable plastic? Probably increased decay from radiation exposure.
---
The worst part is having to carry all that weight to find a place to scrap it unless your camp is close to it. The closest scrapping place would definitely be fort defiance!
---
Mole miner gauntlet is the weakest for unarmed melee weapons. But if you get nerd rage and that unarmed perk card both maxed out. You can probably be doing like 600 damage if your health is below 20 percent.
---
Master of karate and friendship for everyone!
---
Rifleman maxed out on all 3 cards.  I use that in combination with Tank Killer and Demolitions if you have a TSE.
---
I hope this is fixed ASAP. I now have an intense hatred for flying enemies.
---
Your welcome &lt;3
---
Does it matter? Just give me the damn link lmao
---
Well..... that blows.... i wish they did it like some other games where the scrap you see is yours and not someone else's. So no matter if someone else has been there it will be respawned for you with every server hop. But that's just wishful thinking i guess. Thanks for the info!
---
Yeah I made that mistake. Bought about 10 of them before i realized it wasn't counting
---
Nope there's a lot of weapons missing that normally drop as legendary
---
Because the more companies shift to "life services" the more they drag the games out to maintain retention.
---
Most likely based upon the buyers level
---
Maybe speak two languages this isn't a collage paper ( maybe you didn't go to collage and I bet you don't speak another language )
---
Hehehehehe
---
i just found out the same thing a WTF moment for sure
---
You think this subReddit will help you with that?   Nice try.
---
I'm hoping that the addition of player vending and the legendary vendor will finally rectify the damage that duping did to this game. As recently as last week I was invited to trade with a player that had an inventory full of 3* god roll weapons that were pretty obviously duped.  These additions to the game are going to make this sort of stuff obsolete.
---
I've checked your post history... damn, it's almost sad to see someone so obsessed and frustrated about a videogame.
---
Are you sure everything is okay at home? You might have to work on those anger issues a bit.
---
If you use chrome it's built-in.
---
Settings.
---
Site settings.
---
Ads.
---
Link to which?
---
I do that with most ammo save maybe 50 cal, flamer and cryo. But even then it's maybe 2-3 caps per
---
You might be surprised, i am prob going after the 2* weapons first, but some ppl may go back and forth depending on what they are getting as they spend their scrips, after the first time thru it shouldn‘t be bad cause of the 150 scrip daily max tho. I am expecting/hoping for a mad house!
---
Oh, I do realize it just fine.
---
I'm not the one with hundreds of comments only crying about Fallout 76, just saying...
---
^it's ^a ^social ^experiment
---
I'm trying to get unyielded armor which give plus 3 to all stats besides agility I believe and once I get all 5 armor pieces of that, my weapon will probably do 1200 damage with the 1 star level 50 bloodied powerfist I have right now. I have nerd rage and that unarmed perk card maxed out right now. I already do 700 damage and my strength is level 9 soo having 20 or so strength is gonna make it wild. Lol
---
I think the point being... now that EVERYONE has selling and buying at their fingertips... those "top traders" can hoard all they want... but soon, they'll have nobody to sell to.
---
You have hundreds of comments crying about people who dare criticize the game. That is far worse.
---
I think the only ammo you could sell for 1 cap each is shotgun
---
You're pretty braindead for a "women" you know
---
Pretty sure duping isn't fixed but has been reduced to the small scale. I have friends who are reformed dupers and they have friends who they say are still active.
---
I don't know who they are or how they are doing it but I'm confident duping methods still exist.
---
My instigating power fist does 712 it just destroys everything with a sneak attack ( with full set of unyielding armor, radicool, and iron fist) I need to get nerd rage and Bloodied mess
---
I don't think it's going to be a typical battle royale. It certainly sounds similar in lots of ways but they talk about different rounds. Not really sure how that would work but maybe the overall groups get smaller each time? Possibly team based?
---
They also mention nukes and I think they mentioned a closing circle of fire which is very battle royale. But also food? 
---
I wonder if your character is randomised each time you play. 
---
Sounds like the winner will be crowned Overseer! And that you slowly get access to more and more of vault 51?
---
Yeah dude, you ruin the game.
---
Says the dude who post history is full of you whining about people criticizing fo76.
---
Point is your are guaranteed a 3* pretty good chances compaired to what its now
---
I'm actually *just* working on adding wood to the maps. I had excluded them but I've had requests, so standby
---
I use firefox but I'll take a look.
---
This is what I was looking for! Much obliged for the information! Is the 25% thing also true?
---
"Somebody tell me how to dupe. I just want it for fun XD". R.I.P. bro
---
I have never reached the cap for caps since the player vendor update. Now I have hit the cap twice.
---
Says the dude who can't even answer a simple question of what you will accept as proof. I don't really care what you think since you aren't even capable of answering a simple question. Nor can he even spell woman. LOL

No, only within range of the golf club itself afaik, I've gone to a few camp vendors on the grounds this week

I would love to see a map that correctly marks all the water locations. Soo mant hidden ponds everywhere that could make a camp even more viable
---
Oh, not at all. That's just for the past couple of hours, trying to respond to hundreds of comments in my post.

You, on the other hand, well... *yikes*.

For someone with a college degree in mental health, you should really know by now when to use 'who' and 'whose', though. And I'm not even English!

I was connecting it to ‘Colonial Scrip’ - one of if not the first monies created by The 13 Colonies to try and free themselves from British B.S—— this is even cooler///WORSE lolol
---
Nah. What would set this apart from any other game with an auction house, then?
---
CAMP vending boosts player interaction. Period. 
---
There's a bajillion other games that can allow players to sit and do nothing but trade... but that's so "out of character" for a Fallout game it would make zero sense.
---
Now.. if Beth wanted to add pack Brahmin, so we could become traveling merchants... THAT would be awesome. Have to set some rules though... no fast travel, no "quick access" to inventory (to avoid players using brahmin as "Weapon caches", etc.
---
Hopefully they add a re-roll option (as I thought the same thing) 
---
The way the Purveyor currently is makes my friends who sell high end 3 star legendary items very happy, as the Purveyor is really no threat to their business at all (people are just going to turn lots of junk into less junk).  I thought that Bethesda was going to try to offer players an alternative to spending thousands of CAPS (as much as 25,000 to 125,000) for items from high end sellers, but it doesn't look that way.
---
My bloodied knuckles do over 700 depending on my health I am positive a mole miner gauntlet will do more.
---
If you want to keep a mutation, you want to get the Luck perk (both ranks) of Starched Genes. Any method of getting rid of radiation. including the Sun Kissed perk (the one you mentioned) runs the risk of getting rid of any mutations you currently have. Hope that helps.
---

Yeah when you loot bodies or containers, everyone gets their own loot but whatever is out... is every man/woman for themselves. You’re welcome. 😊

I can't see it and although i think crossplay between the console versions would likely be okay but i would not want it with PC due to the different input methods, different settings and the hackers/modders etc

I am having a lot of fun. And repair kits are not p2w.
---
Maybe they took the lightbulbs from the Whitespring; there’s that one hallway to a couch and elevators on the ground floor past the theater that has been dimly lit since the patch.
---
Nope, I actually look more forward to seeing creative camps than the actual vendor items
---
Is it a RNG spawn?  Or guaranteed spawn?
---
Says the "women" who can't even hit copy and paste Omegalol
---
Thanks for the info. I'll throw it in my vending machine. 
---
I have a BSS Sickle that I'll play around with I've heard that's good.
---
Ok let me rephrase it, I don't care enough to report people I used to dupe with because I view it as Bethesda's fault.... The world is full of greedy people, nothing will change that and if people see an opportunity to make money off of a developers mistakes then I don't blame them. 
---
As I said I did it. I made some money but it was more out of fun for me, I got bored so I stopped, I also have a full time job and didn't really need the money. 
---
Most of the people I did this with did not work, They all said they were " consultant's" which I took as social security check people, so maybe the money they get from doing this type of stuff is important to them, maybe it pays for there food... Not my place to take food out of anyone's mouth.
---
Bethesda needs to fix the servers end of story.
---
How do i ruin the game for you then explain to me because im not going to be selling anything that is duped so how dose it effect you personally
---
Well that sucks I guess  I missed that part. I was really looking forward to getting the Mr Fuzzy skin, I think it was number 10 I think.
---
Because they put future content in with the patches . Why didn’t they have the legendary vendor items and limits until last patch ? Shouldn’t they of known that at launch by your theory? Or why haven’t they already shown the last of the 4 horseman skins if it’s already in the game?
---
What perks and armor do you have?
---
You will not love this game of you expect it to be fallout 5.
---
Awesome I’ll add you when I get home!

# Come on you vault dwellers, you wanna live forever!

Lmao I watched someone spawn on my camp and immediately run off the cliff. Now I understand why

i dont remember is number but yeah it was inside a cavern that lead to a alternate reality where everything was dead even plant life
---
I tend to reply to everyone in my post, yes. My... "crying" activity is reduced to this place. Yours is spread across many posts and months back.
---
We can do that, I’m usually down for whatever.
---
weapons that the game spawned prior to update 5 are considered historical or legacy weapons because they spawn with the explosive variance and after update 5 they removed explosive variance from a certain class of weapons- energy
---
Thanks man! :)
---
Bloodied mess? What's that?
---
Might have to server hop a few times but it'll be there.
---
Copy that, thanks bro
---
flavor_any I believe is the game saying "we'll spawn any flavor here" so when you go there it will be *some* seasoning, but that is random.
---
Mothman eggs can be mapped, but they only exist in those 2 patches at point pleasant.
---
Eggs I will look into because that's a good shout
---
Sugar bombs can be done easily, they're exported. I'll put together a map.
---
Glowing resin is know as "sap" in the game. It's currently under the "common flora" map above. However given your post I think i'll put together a big "cooking ingredients" map. Can you think of anything else that could go on?
---
AI isn't currently mapped but maybe in a week or two. Raw meat that's laying around however can be, and I shall be adding later today,
---
Yeah i do want it for fun theres some pretty funny bugs out there and i want to see if the dupe glitches actually work so i can send it off to bathesda to make the game better like i have done with 100% of the game breaking bugs/glitches
---
\&gt;.&lt;
---
I spent my first 25 levels with all my crops and my water purifier on the roof of my floating house. They're not so good with guaranteeing the "on the ground" placement.
---
Well I severely doubt you're not going to sell, but duping crisises like the one we saw early in the year saw many innocent accounts being banned for what the dupers caused, or people would buy weapons from dupers and get banned and also it drives market prices way down.
---
Nah you need to do the leg work or it's pure speculation. Email tech support at Bethesda I'm sure they just copy-pasted me a generic response.
---
It helped in the past so dont see why it shouldnt now
---
There is one due East of the monongah plant's cooling towers as well
---
I see legendary scout armor, and that's all I needed. It's beautiful.

I'd go the other way. Shotty ammo and the plastic requirement is off the chart.

Wow, congratulations you've done it, by finding that typo you've proven that fo76 ISN'T a bug filled mess being pushed by a greedy shady anti consumer company. Man, what would they have done without you?

Is that really how pathetic you've gotten? You can't argue your point at all so you rely on my phones autocorrect being a bit overbearing and "you're just salty!" ad nauseam?

As someone who kept playing 2 hours past when I usually eat lunch and only stopped because it was actually starting to be pretty uncomfortable...

Yes it does.

Was it a guy in x01 with flame paint? Iv done that a couple times now lol

Haha.  No, I never went to collage - I don't like using scissors or glue, or cutting up paper or any of that stuff.  I did go to college though.  I probably should become bilingual, but eh, not a lot of call for it in Southwest PA, and I'm pretty lazy when it comes to things outside my job and my hobbies.  My guess is that you are trying to communicate that Gauss Rifles and the other weapons you listed above will no longer spawn with the explosive prefix?  Is that accurate?
---
If you don't have Starched Genes, yet, you can buy Nuka Grape at Whitesprings.  It will clear a ton of rads and you won't lose your mutations.
---
Honestly, I don't know. Does the main esm not have pointers to others? Presumably then it's just being 'unpacked'.

It does seem like I'm arriving to find lots of baddies pretty often. I went to one camp last night and the guy was swarming with 60 lvl dogs destroying his base. I see he has two turrets on a perch that weren't working, so I figure I'd be nice and run up to repair them. Didn't notice punji boards everywhere til I was smack in the middle of them all!
---
What the?! I didn't eat any corn!
---
This is incredible work! Congrats to everyone involved, really nice visualizations. 
---
One small favor to ask....what about screws? I always, always need screws, and fo76map.com doesn't really feature their locations either. Anyone?
---
I made a bunch of caps while sleeping on a bus! This update is awesome.
---
Imo good the prices need to come down there through the roof atm and i have zero reason to sell anything since i have just shy of 100k caps that's on 4 mules im a level 340 and i have nothing else to do i dont need anything else im happy with the way my build is and the weapons and armour i have i just like going around online games and finding game breaking bugs as long as its just me that its effecting its not hurting anyone else isit
---
No, because no matter your damage you cannot reliably one shot someone at full health. Being a bloodied build, you open yourself up for being one shot by anything. Kill speed is fine, but you have no margin for error. If someone touches you, you die.
---
Word.  Thanks for the info.
---
Yes, I've vocal about the issues with the game trying to get it to improve, how terrible! Once again, you are also confusing being critical of something with "you mad/sad/salty/crying". 
---
Unlike you I don't want to settle for the dumpster fire the game currently is, so I am vocal trying to get it to be a better game. 
---
The difference here is, you are just whining at anyone who disagrees with you, while I'm actually trying to get shit changed to make the game better. What I'm doing will make the game better, what you are doing will not. It will do the opposite, just "accepting" whatever they throw at you regardless of how good or bad it is won't fix or improve anything.
---
You are literally being detrimental to the game while I'm trying to get it to become a good game.
---
I usually do breach and clear but thought it would be helpful for others
---
TIME TO BOMB MORGANTOWN
---
It's also in the middle of the ash heap and on smoggy days, you can see my glowing "Welcome Home" sign's neon glowing eerily in the distance.
---
Ahhh these are great!! Your art never ceases to amaze me :)
---
When you buy it the game makes you learn it then gives you the plans anyway so its known im saving it for my friend so he doesnt have to farm as long as i did
---
Thought I read you can only buy 1 item per day.  Should clear out fast-ish.
---
Uncommon plans and ammo.
---
Have you tried giving them to a friend, have them drop them and see if it triggers when you collect? I have no info either way but wondered.
---
I have a fair few magazines I was going to sell but this is making me think I need to lower my planned price as most are trash like breathe underwater
---
I think it's built in too

 &gt; Ahhh these are great!! Your art never ceases to amaze me :)
---
That can happen??  How long does it take?  I'm always so anxious at seeing that red bar on my screen I never let her stay hungry/thirsty.
---
It’s a luck perk card. Gives I believe an extra 15% damage and makes your targets explode. Great for the bloodied build
---
Your reply is about as factual as Trump's tweets.
---
Oh ya. They said that already. Thanks for the clarification.
---
&gt; I haven't seen many weapons selling for over 2K caps lately
---
I sold a 2 *  furious +VATS crit handmade for 3k and a 3 * Vanguard marine leg with -20% junk weight (can't remember the 3rd star) for 4k to same person yesterday. He also bought a bunch of 1 * crap for 100-1000 that I assume he's either trying to flip or is just use them as a means of converting caps into scrip. 
---
I was almost at max caps for a minute, but I found someone selling a TSE Dragon for 9999 and snatched it up for a buddy.
---
yeah I was super confused, thought for sure I capped out at a low health. Played the Gorgnak game all the way through (didn't know if you left the game it saved your spot at the time) so I was idle a good long while.
---
I guess not getting a joke on the internet  gets you called a pancake?
---
I used to dump a lot of legendaries in the suitcase at watoga station. One time I put dozens of weapons and armors in it. Before I walked far a group of 4 players arrived, one of them saw the content of the suitecase and started screaming to his friends like he won the lottery. They split the find and sold many of them to the vendor bot in the end.
---
What? Have you not been following the datamining threads? Everything you just said aside from the legendary vendor skins, since it is just a moleman skin with a hat on has been shown in the datamined threads.
---
Do the easiest ones: athletics, swimming, and archery. Doesn't take very long.
---
I wasn't having any luck selling anything either...and then I realized that I forgot to hook-up the power!
---
Do other mods also give plans ?
---
I mean private servers were confirmed a long time ago and the code for them is already in the game if they didnt put them out that would be a pretty serious step back on their word. They said they would be out within the first year of release.
---
Almost sure it doesn't like 95%
---
Maps, all treasure maps you have, even those hiden in your underarmor!!!! GIVE ME IT !!!!
---
1st fast travel to whitesprings the main building. You should see a red sports car in front of you.
---
2nd on the hood is where he will spawn. All you have to do is server hop and if you don’t see him leave and repeat.
---
You don’t even have to move just wait a second for the textures to load I when it happened to me all I saw was the head and a hand for a second. This was the easiest and fastest for me.
---
Worked fine for me this morning.  *shrug*
---
You will want to be built for Survival in my opinion . PVP is pretty much the big thing about it, yes.
---
No PA is very viable as many players do it from what I gather
---
Builds are pretty much balanced and are more for your preference as opposed to one being better than another.
---
Players can already trade just from inventories but they also just added player vending machines a few days ago.
---
Camps have greatly increased budget space allowing for more to be built along with more variations and decor to be placed.
---
I personally enjoy lots of things with my friend. Too many to be real specific. 
---
I have no idea about the mods.
---
I think I simply enjoy the survival aspect of the game the most, that and camps. The idea that I have my own little abode to run to in the middle of a nuclear wasteland that I can defend with my life if I so choose just makes for a really good game for me
---
Tossing in that Wealth of Nations quote, NICE!
---
Just don't do it dude, it ruins It for everyone, we don't need another duping crisis.
---
Cool thank you for the  response and the post generally
---
Thank you for your service.
---
Definitely been buying a lot of plans especially decoration plans for cheap I seem to keep running into. Have found a couple guns for good prices tho! And I’m more of a PA user soo as far as apparel I’ve been gettin a nice collections of rare outfits and masks. Good luck!
---
I would have died playing wastelad if need rage was silent.
---
Constantly on Rad Showers also lag out the server! All those particle effects!
---
How much is any given treasure map worth to you?
---
Well some say relogging helps, but I guess you've done that. For me only revive ally is pending.
---
Console XB1.
---
When you say this someone looking to render a map, could you point to them please?
---
When I went looking for it I found it on the third hop at the mothman statue. Try there.
---
Also, the camera itself *apparently* can’t be dropped, I haven’t tried myself (someone please confirm), so you would need to buy a broken one off of someone, not a repaired, usable one.
---
I think if there is crossplay between consoles pc would get crossplay to, because xbox and windows are both from microsoft
---
What are you talking about, copy an paste what? You are the one who can't even spell properly "women" means plural of "woman". Are you honestly this slow or are you trolling?
---
All Fallout games (since nr. 3) has been easy though. It's an rp game, you'd have to role play to make it hard. (only fistfight, no chems, no pants etc.)
---
I was one of the biggest/loudest proponents and defenders of 76 when it launched and sunk hundreds of hours into it during the first 2 months, but I have since stopped playing it altogether.
---
Looking back, I can clearly see what happened. There was an enormous pressure put on BGS to release 76 ASAP, even if the game was literally half finished. Looking at  day 1 and what we've got right now (I admit  they've put out A LOT of work so far), the difference is staggering.
---
One would have thought all these QoL fixes and additions to the game would have come at launch, but clearly they didn't have the time to finish implementing them.
---
Had they delayed it by these 6 months or so, the initial feedback would have been very positive.
---
That said, I did have tons of fun in it, and it's definitely not a bad game. But as cliche as it may sound, it left a sour taste in my mouth. I burned out on it and I can't bring myself to play it again. Maybe in a year or two.
---
System?
---
Plans, cheap fusion cores, serums
---
NP, I didn't interpret it as rude.  
---
Tis just my best guess given what (at times, little) I know how the perk system works.
---
Yeah but see I don't have the special points to spare for that so I was hoping to be able to get around it. Lol
---
Are you stupid or somthing what dont you get i want it for myself no one else myself im not selling anything ill be keeping shit to myself fuck me its like talking to my cat shes got more fucking brains than you
---
Oops...PC
---
I’m not saying it can’t be that, but it happened to me when I was having a spat of Legendary enemies blowing up like legendary robots do; ghouls, mole rats, super mutants... just seemed more like a bug to me than an in-universe, planned mechanic.
---
Doesn't seem so? You should be able to earn them before the backpack from what I understand.
---
I really only buy or sell plans. Gotta catch them all!
---
mmatique - I'll be back on in about 20 minutes if you are still around
---
Bloodied is the most powerful. But since you dont want to die I have no fracking idea.
---
Sorry bud, I'm on PS4
---
It's still a very low chance unfortunately :\
---
What do you mean? You might want to read the datamining threads from around the BETA and launch. Yes all this stuff was datamined roughly 6 months ago.
---
Oh :(
---
Well, I hope you can enjoy it again one day!
---
See under 'Flora', a map of water flora. It's not perfect but it helps approximate most bodies of water
---
So maybe you should stop whining and crying at people who are trying to improve the game.
---
I Play in the evenings, I prefer gaming to watching television, and don't even get to play every weekend, I have played all the fallout games, and normally play in hardcore mode, so this game has been pretty easy to me.
---
No worries!
---
I wouldn't think so either but you know, I also think some of the simpler bugs in the game would be fixed by now too so...Lol
---
For me anyway I feel a little weird trespassing.
---
Ok. I might just chance it. Lol
---
Alright dude, apparantly it takes more than 3 seconds to copy and paste 1 link of proof. You're quite the troll "women"
---
Its hit and miss. I've done it one night and the whole thing was empty, another night and i had soooo much ore.
---
I even sold a BE MG42 to a vendor bot because of it, as well as my first explosive weapon, a Tse laser pistol, so I could have some room for food and junk. The game has changed so much since launch.
---
Buy magazine, drop magazine, pick up magazine might work
---
Games going down for maintenance at 3:30, lets hope they dont fix this lmao
---
Man I wish I wasn’t at work I really wanna see this bad boy lol
---
I'm just gonna wait a few days. I've got the three weapons I'm built around so I don't imagine I'll get much better. Maybe I'll get lucky with armor but I'm always in my power armor anyways.
---
Haha shoot really? That means it’s probably gonna be fixed 😓
---
I use it on one character and have it with mutations and forget it off sometimes and never had a problem
---
It has tail physics
---
Cue “am I banned posts” and “when are the servers back? Its my day off and this is ridiculous” posts
---
50-150caps. Some good people are selling them for 5caps, don't be stupid like them, i have egouth caps to feed you all!
---
Lets see, I hear its because theres a new dupe glitch, so that might be the exploit theyre fixing lets see
---
Yes it’s an energy weapon, but it’s also a heavy weapon so it benefits from heavy weapon perks. Since it is an energy weapon, it no longer spans with the legendary explosive prefix. Also, anti armour doe snot currently work with energy weapons, so the stabilised perk only increases accuracy and the anti armour legendary prefix does nothing either, hopefully this gets fixed one day.
---
Sweet. Hope bans are incoming as well.
---
Sure, if you didn't care you'd not have brought it up.
---
I've tried to help you to vent your frustrations, anger, and sadness... I really have. But I'm afraid your issues are bigger than I anticipated, and you need professional help. I'm sorry.
---
I have failed you, reccession. I have failed you.
---
Same I was trying to get free atoms, found out you have to find them all yourself and said screw it and gave all my magazines to a random player for stash space
---
I saw the post, I think they're talking about duping
---
I've just gone there after reading this, doesn't seem any different to me!
---
Literally no one:...
---
This awesome community: time to do a give away for the people who given to the community and dont forget to smash that mf like button
---
Love the idea tho
---
Seeing this now makes me want to see data mines from now on. Great collection of stuff to decorate my home for customers.😁
---
What is Bethesda’s long term solution to financing development and keeping power up at the servers? Money from sales of the game must have slowed to a trickle and the programmers and artists still have to eat. Can the sale of cosmetic items really keep everything running?
---
He wasn’t in PA rip
---
Nooo that will be tradable backpack mod that i still dont have. So how much hours it is since now?
---
I feel like making requests when given such an amazing gift is rude, but as you said suggestions are ok, I'd love to see maps of ingredients for the Disease Cures and Healing Salves of the other regions as well, not just the forest. I was looking at the map with firecracker berries, and the abundant flora map can be a bit overwhelming with all that blackberry. Who knew our Lord Mothman liked to keep all the berries separated so tidily?
---
1:1 is the standard.
---
I know you said you didn't want to open source it, but as a fellow .net developer, I'de be super interested to see how it works. Is there any chance you'd be up for sharing?
---
I should be - IGN is ChooChooDrane
---
Hmm, thanks. I will try it out tonight. Hopefully it works for me.
---
For the game itself, definitely a boom. For the level 200+ player who already has the gear they want, still a boom, just less of one.
---
Whenever I go to big Fred’s I get foxes
---
I'm on xbox i sell them for 200 a piece, from what I've seen everyone else is selling for 500-1000. Have 14 of the 19 serums available.
---
Ah okay! Thx for the heads up
---
I'm not going to link anything until I know which link you will accept, so that when I link it you'll not be able to claim it isn't proof now.
---
Notice how you are the one who can't tell me which you'd like for proof or even what you would accept as proof. Obviously if you actually cared about the proof you'd have said what it was you wanted as proof. Instead you are trying to leave yourself a way to weasel out once proof is given.
---
Damn, that's crazy lol. Thanks for letting me know!
---
Awe Lord well I'm not doing that,anytime soon lol I can't even defend the Brahmin alien cows that well
---
Fair enough man! I'm not hatin' at all. I'm flabbergasted is all, that's real devotion
---
I just heard that someone got something out of it. I will try it again tonight and hopefully it works.
---
That's both hilarious and freakin awesome
---
A guaranteed spawn should be in Thunder Mountain  power plant, in one of the tents
---
Thats said, my 3* Executioners Gatling Laser Prime MELTS scorched beasts like butter.
---
I understand your line of thought.
---
10 minutes from right now.
---
Is the cap for the amount of caps you can carry still 25000?
---
I would settle for a fast travel mat.  I've had to dig 3-4 people out of my foundation already.
---
Bloody hell that's a lot of grinding.
---
No offense meant, but selectively gathering data from players isn't quite as effective as taking the locations directly from the game files.  For static locations, the game gives you 100% of the information, where player-selected data will not be as complete.
---
It's not a bad resource, but it is in no way better than what you get directly from the source.
---
Yeah, you can't server hop for junk anymore. Plus if another character was there before you, it'll look like it's there, then disappear when the server loads in.
---
same thing nearly happened to me, when I finally beat the game I was moments from collapsing. I learned my lesson though, I made sure to equip Happy Camper before I started Wastelad :D
---
It's not trespassing. We mark ourselves on the map.  That's an invite to anyone and everyone! Come on in!
---
Not frustrated, angry, or sad. There you go with your "your just ___" again. You are really like a broken record, just repeat the same thing over and over because you have nothing of value to actually say.
---
Nice fresh like 3 day old account too. Not shady at all.
---
Am i the only one who thinks this is cringy? "I hope you have a good, personal story related to a gaming franchise that i can judge and I'll give you a handout, lol". It's not like you can fact check either. "I'm a huge fallout fan, started with 3 when my whole family got cancer and died. It really helped me through. Killing everyone in megaton as a coping mechanism is seared into my memory".
---
Not sure why they would let us start collecting scrips and do that, do you have a reference?
---
That argument makes -0- sense. It's like saying you shouldn't pay taxes on toilet paper because you paid to take the bus to the store. You could've just walked where you needed to go for free.
---
At any rate, the problem is that you're thinking of the 10% charge as a 'tax' because everyone is calling it a tax. It isn't a tax and Bethesda has never referred to it as a tax. What it is is a form of quantitative tightening -- removing money from the supply in order to combat inflation (making money worth less if not worthless). This keeps prices reasonable (and in the real world it keeps wages stagnant, but this is video game world so that's not really a big problem) which is really the primary concern. And, yes, the cap limit, the daily cap limit and the fast travel convenience fee are all forms of quantitative tightening. This is a good thing that keeps prices reasonable and the economy moving.
---
If you're not crippling her with any weapon you're doing it all wrong. Cripple both times she has full health so she stays grounded and unload everything you got. With 8-10 people you should get her done in 10 minutes max
---
It seems to me like if someone else got it on that server, it's gone for sure. But if you didn't, you can server hop and as long as no one else had gone by it should be there.
---
🙃
---
it's got what plants crave!
---
really great art, look forward to seeing the project grow.
---
Nobody wants to buy my free watoga flyers, either. Only 1 cap each.
---
I just don't get it.
---
Its currently glitched and doesn't register
---
At least we know the content they’re releasing is of much higher quality than past months. Stuff like the Opossum hat and the well travelled pipboy paint are some of my favourite releases. 
---
Can’t wait for them to add the backpack with the shovel attached to the side, would fit my hunter/tracker character perfectly
---
Could not have said it better myself
---
Yea i hear ya, i just want to blow my scrips on 2* weapons to get explosive or ffr guns and ss or power attack dmg melee! Maybe a few mystery roles depending on how lucky i feel!
---
Than maybe it would be more worth for you, to look on this subbredit and search for "treasure maps" most liked post have photo of every single mud, easy to find. And guess what u will get maybe even rare plans from this. And once you arrive at mud, u can click it how many times you have this one map!
---
The freestates seceded from their government in a similar fashion to the Confederate states. I thought the symbolism was perfect.
---
Uh huh, you sure like to think that way do you fembot? Try harder next time to make such fake claims
---
Do we have any idea what causes that? I've got a boat build and I tried to make a flotilla and now I have a foundation with 2 stairs attached under water that I can not scrap.  
---
I get the error of leaving items unsupported even though there is nothing attached to the stairs.
---
Its for a new duping method, dw
---
Love how when I get on this happens same for yesterday
---
Because your's doesn't make sense. There is no leap in logic large enough that I could ignore the shady things bethesda has done recently, and the buggy mess that this game currently is. You are right, I can't understand how you can ignore all of that and be thanking them for it.
---
Seriously me too stuck I’m trying to level up my side character now but it sucks because I had finally hit the max cap amount with the maxed out xo1 and allmost all the serum recipes on my main
---
I mean whatever floats your boat my dude
---
Nooooo wtb carry capacity mod plan PS4!!! :D
---
i‘m going to add you my psid is GotVaxDax
---
I was being serious.
---
It’s the only one I need then will have done three 😂😭
---
Yup - if you sell too much from the vending machine the extra caps are lost.
---
Nah ive got another account just forgot the email and  password to it go look it up sp00dge15cum if you dont believe me been on reddit about a year ish
---
Well hi I’m Sh3lls I’m 13? Years old I was kinda bored of playing halo and so I went to look for a new game I find fallout 4 on Xbox so I decided to buy it I’ve loved fallout ever since and play it daily I bought fallout 76 about a week ago and am loving every bit of it (it’s also really easy to level up) but uh yeah that’s about it
---
No problem. I followed a bloodied build guide recently after spending 700+ hrs not really caring about base damage. Wish I had done it sooner, it’s so OP! Also throw on serendipity and mysterious savior to stand a good chance while having low health
---
awww I wish I'd know that the stabilize and the Anti-armor didn't work with it
---
Its a good game
---
I wish they would address the anti-armor issue also. I have a 3 star AA plasma gat on my heavy guy I’ve been hanging on to for what feels like eons. My commando picked up a 3 star AA laser rifle just a couple of days again. Here’s to hoping!
---
thx for the info :D
---
Still can't tell me what type of proof you want. Go figure, typical hysterical little boy stamping his feet.
---
Whyyyyyyyy is this a thing, I always feel that this game was a step back or two from Fallout 4
---
Do you have a higher quality version of the random encounter map?
---
Thank you all for the kind words. I just got the gatling gun accessory today, so I have to get a move on with this.
---
Oh yeah good thinking
---
I cant say a word - I'm in excavator and armed with a switchblade. :)
---
Did you target them with VATS and were able to highlight a mine on them?
---
I saw this and was very happy, it really needed some more light.
---
Ditto. Plans are what I am looking for.
---
I got a t-45 jet pack plan for 150 caps today.
---
People buy treasure maps like crazy. 70 caps. They have bought all of mine.
---
I too like to go to buffets that have zero food and only put something out after enough outrage from paying customers!
---
 Thinking like that is what tells them they can get away with it.
---
Some good. Some bad. Too bad this thing about them allegedly plagiarizing a TES adventure game is making the rounds right now.
---
The Camp Venture one is similar to the back to basics course with balance beams and whatnot. From the spawn point, run straight through the lower section of the camp to the far side. You'll see the table and balloons set up just past the far wall.
---
The Sunny Top one starts near the chairlift on the far side of the building from where you spawn. It's basically a downhill speed run on path covered in floor traps.
---
Alright Fembot, whatever you think. I don't understand why it's so hard to copy and paste in 3 seconds your evidence. Haha
---
Hard I feel like people are gonna spawn trap a lot so it’s best to go in without fast travel or just wait until day 3
---
if ur on xb1 I need all the help I can get after I now can’t access my main character I need to level up my side characters because apparently there’s no fix to the instant disconnect glitch 🙃
---
But I just got home from work and going outside is dumb in Cle. 😩
---
Dont count the Gatling Plasma out. With the right main perk and all your cards in order, you can cut anything in your way down FAST. Plus its only yellowcake for Plasma Cores. That stuff is everywhere!
---
Forrest. My turrets blow everything to stratosphere without my camp being damaged. Low level area.
---
Also new players pass by.
---
And i have steel extractor :3
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2935
---
Apropos of nothing but I love your username.
---
Do the sheepsquatch event since a bunch of them spawn in the middle of the event.
---
Have you tried it with any other items?  If it’s a duping glitch I’d report it to Bethesda right away
---
Easiest way I found was to fast travel to Flatwoods and go south until you hit the tents. Keep going slightly further south and you should see the center of the bridge to your left. Pull out your camera and point it towards the bridge center and walk towards it until you see "New River Gorge Bridge" appear in the top right of the camera lens. Take a picture and you'll got it.
---
Damn, I am a blind. Didn't that second one, haha.
---
I remember the first beta session, it took me three tries to get out if the vault from server crashes
---
I think East of the fire station if not east of beltching Betty
---
Same here... Set up my mule outside of Slocum Joe's. Mostly seeing high level players. Thought about sending random messages but I don't want to be that guy.
---
Tried to post on the lfg but I guess Slocum is a curse word? Told me to remove the inappropriate content.
---
Platform? Got mic?
---
I’ve only seen a legendary Protectron explode. May the scorched and others have that Luck perk that lets you pull a grenade when you die.
---
Up northwest there is a random event spawn called Leader of the Pack that spawns 3 wolf packs. 
---
The same area can also spawn the event Wolf Horde. 
---
Finally, every now and then the natural spawn at Campfire Tales will bring along some wolves before/during the event.
---
Thanks so much. Didn't see that second mchine.
---
I like the savage divide, specifically leaning towards the forest area as I have a cozy cabin situated high up in the hills. I only get low level bugs attacking the camp and I get a lovely view of the Whitespring whenever someone decides to drop a nuke. That being said I did have one problem with a stray Scorchbeast that wasn’t too fun to deal with at level 32.
---
If you specifically looking for something is gonna be a bit higher that what you see around
---
Xbox One, yes I have a headset
---
This is great! It'd be helpful to have a map key, though. Tons of little dots, but unless you already know what's there, the colors don't really mean anything?
---
What Mappalacia post?
---
Just a ring of hundreds of vault dwellers hand-in-hand surrounding Whitespring just standing there. Come and take it you filthy bastards.
---
Hornwright site 3 or Lucky Hole Mine with excavator armor and you'll have more lead than you know what to deal with. You can even super super the smelting process for free materials.
---
Happened to me too. My first thought was great I’m going to get permabanned for duping us req holotapes.
---
Thank you Geneziz and Happy Mother's Day! Enjoy the 10c's!
---
'Yours', not 'your's'. We might need a couple more grammar hours than I thought...
---
Look, it's simple. And this is what you don't seem to get. I'm not denying anything, I'm not ignoring anything. I am offering a positive message.
---
I really, really doubt that you are somehow involved in mental health if you can't figure out that things rarely are only black or white.
---
Yeah. I'm on ps4. I still have all my pics but now all load screens are just default stuff.
---
OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Sorry for the late notice, went directly to the kill and had to quit the game for now, since I have to take care of my dog.
---
Tea pot event
---
Its a spinoff from the B-team, why is this not more common knowledge? What this game does has no bearing on the main games from the A-team at bethesda
---
PSN MisterBee917
---
Come rest &amp; relax at my new shop - just up the path past the Free Range event in the Mire!
---
Good to hear it, soldier!
---
Attacking my camp everytime someone uses the machine. I camp on twin lakes if that helps.
---
Because little incel boys like you try to weasel out of being proven wrong when given proof without first making sure its the proof you'll accept.
---
I have multiple links to multiple different things, so I need to know which you want as proof and what you will even accept as proof. So once you are capable of actually articulating what you will accept as proof, then I'll be glad to share it, until then the ball is in your court.
---
Orbital strike still works like a charm.....
---
The event right out side of the racetrack is a wolf pack leader
---
Savage Divide, my home is on a cliff face high above launch site Bravo, it's peaceful, decent view and within touching distance of launching nukes. Negative, bit costly traveling to far off places but not too bad really, that's the only negative for me.
---
Yep, sometimes death can't come fast enough. Thanks. Take care of the dog. +karma
---
How can I start the event?
---
“20 hours of Fallout New Vegas” You poor, poor thing 
---
But no at the early game your best bet sub level 15 is to run a two handed melee weapons as your main form of offence with a pump action incase things get too dicey. Once you pass the 15 mark you can then begin to branch out and develop your build.
---
Sweet, thankyou man
---
So you don't understand how quotations marks work... I was mocking YOUR typos like you did mine. Can't take your own joke? :(
---
It happened a to me a few months ago too and now again. And I had a couple of photos of friends that don't play anymore. I still have them, just no longer as load screens.
---
This... makes me want to be good at something, too.
---
I now regret spending my last few atoms on the PA skin
---
Is this post the most epic troll post ever? Can't be a serious post.
---
Praise the lord and pass the ammunition.
---
You mean the mod?
---
Well small world, that was you too :P
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blemhg/appalachia_aerial_map/
---
The other thing I wanted to add is why are you trying to share a perk when not in team? Herd mentality buffs your special when on team and you can't share a perk with no one if not a a team.
---
What part of the forest do you live in?  Do you integrate any of the environment into your camp?  I built my Mire camp at the end of a driveway that has a truck.  Have it parked right next to my house now.
---
Nobody upvote this comment.
---
Either get a mike or arrange for someone to help you by posting it here. It’s a multiplayer game; no issue with some quests requiring multiple people.
---
Don’t worry! You’ll only need to grind several weeks worth of dailies in order to get it!
---
Ahhh yes. The "I'm going to type in all caps to get my point across." A true man of culture. 
---
Sure, reporting them is the correct choice, but as long players can create new accounts for free then it's ultimately useless.
---
I'm not saying Bethesda shouldn't ban dupers, but they really need to buckle down on the main issue itself. 
---
I can buy a Legacy BE Laser rifle for like 5K to 10K. That's insane!
---
cranberry bog..scorchbeasts are my friends
---
No the plan. The plan costs 6900 caps from the production wing terminal and the mod costs 550 from the military wing terminal
---
Every time I get that message I travel there to see the camp in my spot, and 9/10 times there's nothing there or nearby lol.
---
This man fashions.
---
My gt is phishntrips I'm online after 6 during the week and all day on the weekends. I run with a pretty solid crew that loves helping people out and can make or mod pretty much everything on one of my three characters. Hit me up and I'd be glad to help. 
---
My only condition going forward helping people is I do not offer assistance during the DMV quest. Everyone is on there own there. I just don't have it in me to walk through that one again
---
No problem  :)
---
&gt;Incel
---
Imagine that, thinking I'm anywhere close to the wretches because you can't provide any type of proof.
---
Ball has always been in your court dude, giving me the ball takes 3 seconds but you would rather argue *how* I recieve it rather then just giving me it
---
Middlemountain cabins has a crossbow spawn and bolts.  Plus if you server hop it can spawn yaoi gui,honey beasts (and bees) and radscorpions for shooting/picture challenges  .
---
White springs has radstags (by the clubhouse and behind a row of houses on The "emmett mountain disposal" side 
---
And squirrels and rabbits by the service entrance. Wolves also can spawn at the power station by whitesprings.
---
Just fixed it, should be a much better quality map now.
---
Swimming has that weird revival part. I did hacking - you get 90% done just launching a nuke
---
Yeah, completed that on today.
---
I've got 5 broken ones and one repaired one (beyond the one I use), IGN codemonkey001. I've verified I can drop the broken ones but haven't tried the repaired one.
---
Failing that, a broken one reliably spawns in the lighting booth of the theater at Watoga High School, on top of the shorter circular filing cabinet in the southeast corner.
---
Earlier today I noticed **crafting ammo was not consuming steel** at all.
---
Are you the stupid one? Everyone having duped items caused a giant banwave which caught alot, and I mean ALOT, of innocent players, just because you aren't selling doesent mean yous rent damaging.
---
I bet the view is pretty sweet.  All i see is trees, lol.  I'm all the way up by the compass rose in the north east so your travel costs are still probably cheaper than mine!  I used to camp near the steel mill, its a fun fight against those mutants and they re spawn constantly.
---
Have you considered making a map of common spawning grounds for Legendary enemies?
---
I’ve had my camp in sane location since I was Level 35 (now 278). It’s in the protected zone so no nukes. Southwest on map, near Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm.
---
It's a new backpack in fact, you can craft it in the armor workbench.
---
That's ok, I am offering them to anyone who is struggling to find one. Working and with film
---
I’ll need to start checking more then sorry didn’t know that lol.
---
How long til the Mods lock this threa?  OP seems incapable of having any sort of discussion with anyone who has a contrasting viewpoint, and insists on doxxing commenters with contrary viewpoints and harassing them.
---
Wow I never knew there were so many, many thanks 👍
---
If you knew even a tad about software development you'd know that stubbing out "content" is done all the time so as to allow for a hook in the future to be able to seamlessly integrate it. Whereas if the stub isn't there from the onset you'd have to reengineer large chucks of the codebase.  That is what software architecture is about and why you have roadmaps.  It's all about planning ahead. 
---
I'm not sure why you feel the need to bully the OP, he was simply expressing his thoughts in his post. If you'd like to have a  "shit on FO76" post, write your own. If you do in in the fallout sub you'll get lots of echo chamber feedback that you seem to be craving. Give the OP a break and go kick some other kid around.
---
When hovering over the challenge, press Triangle on PS4 (and presumably Y on XBox). It'll then track on the main map page and pop up on screen when a challenges are done.
---
Addressing a new dupe glitch. It’s better than waiting 2 weeks
---
What u/modran said, had this issue myself. Just drop the magazine and pick it back up and you’ll get the challenge recognition
---
Yeah, why are servers down at the middle of the day Friday for maintenance? Weird af
---
Sometimes the message pops up as a bug and shuts down the server. I hope it is otherwise my friend evening of chilling on Fallout 76 is screwed.
---
On Twitter they say they had to fix an exploit.
---
They did it yesterday so... Any day is a good day
---
But at least they had to work for it! Rather than just stroll right in as though they were invited.
---
Also, they've never actually come up through the foundation. Maybe because the foundation is at max height?
---
Since there’s a big time dupe problem
---
I think it was just implemented in the most recent update, the plan. The mod is just unbelievably rare. The plan is very expensive but I do believe that it's guaranteed to be there.
---
This is taking way longer than expected, yeah.
---
*What's going on up there!?*
---
I actually noticed crafting ammo was not consuming lots of materials. For any type of ammo there was one or two mats that were not going down
---
5.56, 5mm, .50, .308, lots of .308.
---
Their twitter says it is due to an exploit.
---
I just started the game...
---
Apparel and armor should be separate everywhere, really.
---
Fiberglass, fiber optics, lead, nuclear material,violet flux, colbalt flux,screws,fusion cores anti armor anything, circuits ,gold
---
Is it hill that juts out from the top of the world right towards the Whitespring or the one further east with the steep cliff face?  I like the one near the top of the world because it spawns wolves and their meat is great for my sniper character.  I try to avoid the the savage divide myself because I hate the mutant ticks.  They creep me out.
---
So i still dont get your point if im duping for MYSELF how the fuck dose that effect ANYONE else
---
Oh don’t worry I’ll get around to putting more time into new Vegas when my brother gives me my copy of the game back. 
---
Thanks for the tip as well. I didn’t even consider melee weapons after I crafted my first pipe pistol. My dumb ass was trying to use hunting rifles and pipe guns and I was putting all my perk cards into survival buffs
---
I had just fast travelled to a player vendor who had tons of stuff but I couldn’t easily find his machines and ran out of time so il never know what bargains I’ve missed out on lol
---
Twin Lakes , Savage Divide
---
Perks:
---
Close to white springs, west tek, watoga, and burrows
---
Scenery
---
Lots of other players have bases here, so many times you can walk to other player vendors. Which leads to lots of fun foot traffic
---
Firecracker berries craft into a juice that provides +10% crit damage 
---
Boiled/purified Water supply
---
Infinite wood(with woodchucker perk card)
---
Lots of players have a base here so you often have to world hop to find an open space
---
The very rare occasion when a scorchbeast gets dragged into the area is troublesome for low levels
---
Some fast travels can be costly
---
Of course its a troll post i love winding the reddit virgins up 🤣
---
The game does truncation somewhere when it calculates, but I don't know where and under what conditions. The value displayed is then rounded to make matters more difficult.
---
I mean you literally cannot give or drop it.
---
Pahaha! I feel like a dog chasing my own tail.
---
You’re the best my guy I’ll add you when I get off work
---
This ^^
---
Do you want Ghouls?! Because that's how you get Ghouls!
---
I'VE EXPLAINED IT 3 TIMES, ARE YOU SLOW?
---
You have to just laugh, it's the same bug they just took out a few weeks ago when it was affecting the robot vendors.
---
same here got 5 min off gameplay :(
---
*sad mortem inimicus* :(
---
This is how they work in my language, though. English is really complicated, isn't it?

My whole family got cancer and died. :( then my dog and cat got pet cancer and died. :(

.....Turtle here , and I'm just shaking my head.....seriously  I'm the lesser explorer ? look Shia is handy with a gun ,  useful for getting things off the top shelf  and carrying my extra gear but Shia is also insubordinate,  lazy and a drunkard ! why if I had my way we would have already reclaimed all of West Virgina . I should also point out that since I was a coffee technician 3rd class I outrank Shia (espescially since someone ...I wont mention any names ...got demoted .prior to us leaving the vault )  sure Shia has godlike abs but that's not gonna win back America from the commies!!

A source file based compilation of maps of every plant, resource, workbenches almost anything you can think of! [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/) Also, I forgot the first image I put in the post is what you see right off the bat, that was just a pic of my personal mapping stuff. I switched the post up so when people are browsing Reddit via mobile, the right map shows first. Cheers!
---
What was the method?
---
Haha yes I had one of this item and now I have too XD what a funny bug.
---
I have not. I don't know if there's any concrete data on that. I don't want to map "maybe's", you know?
---
Nope, servers are down.
---
And mine
---
I hope they delete the backpack mod plans. That's just silly. Let people work for them :D
---
Sounds good
---
Yeah. Like every now and then, there’s just nothing inside. Usually happens when I do the quest more than once a day in a relatively short amount of time. (Usually if I have to server hop for any reason.)
---
Wrong. Sunkissed does not remove mutes. Brahmin milk doesn't either. I run between 4 and 8 mutes all the time without starched genes. 
---
 Just stay away from decon showers and don't get caught in a ghoul mob or you'll get a mute you don't want. I got one from eating too much food at once too. Save caps so you can buy serums after getting rid of ones you don't want.
---
Have they said an estimate on when it'll be back?
---
Try again:

---
Nice, that's one of my favorite workshops.  I always lock the office and put the fast travel mat and stash box in there.  Not a lot of work-shopping going on any more these days though.  Do you ever use the extractors there?
---
Yeah, same here on XB1. Wanted to sell the 47 requisition holotapes I've picked up throughout my game time since I don't really need them anymore and I keep trying to just drop them since I figured no one was gonna buy them, but it won't unlist and keeps increasing the number of tapes. It's a visual error though, because the number resets upon leaving the server, at least to me it did.
---
That might help ya, I have some exposed ground inside for my Extractor so maybe that's to blame lol
---
But I set up a garage door with pressure plates to make sure my doors would close when people were done, but still never really been locked. Never seen any enemies use the plates, they seem to prefer attacking it instead lol
---
Nothing wrong with enjoying both.
---
Probably not, unless there was more than just a bit of abuse.  They seemed keyed in on the volume more than the actual duping last time.
---
I'm *hoping* they have something in place to detect duping at a granular level (though I don't think they do), if so they can not only track where the duping is coming from, but also (if they want) eliminate all the duped items.  That hasn't been the case up to now though, so it seems unlikely.
---
I was wondering why mine wasn’t working
---
Who said anything about being 25k cap worthy, unless you buy junk/ammo/aid at 25K per unit
---
People see thousands of items for sale, come over, and realize it's all worthless, and those with bloodied builds lament the loss of their rads for nothing.
---
Because it doesn't matter?  It was billed as a full scale Fallout game, a AAA game, from a AAA developer. 
---
There was no discussion about it being from any sort of B team until it was realized that it was far from what was advertised. 
---
You can use spinoff to hand wave problems with the lore and why you dont hear about WV in FO3 or the like, but just being a spinoff doesn't excuse a lack of quality.
---
&gt; Now I expect a Sparta style kick down the well go on I deserve it. 
---
Have an up vote instead. I am expecting nothing from the vendor,  other than more grinding for ghoul slayer weapons with increased bash damage and an extra point in a special stat.
---
Exactly what happens as well. 
---
I can’t stop looking either...
---
It’s the one that’s right next to the train depot just north of the Whitesprings, 15 seconds away from a lead deposit as well
---
Any mutant + strength?
---
As soon as i had a free monent to play ...
---
I REALLY miss the little slot machines we had in FO4 that came with the Vault 88 DLC. 
---
But video game companies are forced to tread VERY lightly when it comes to gambling in video games. Hence GTAO never touched their casino even after 6 years and that’s the  most successful video game of all time. 
---
Underage gambling in video games is unwed a lot of heat, even with interpretations of things like Loot Boxes. I don’t think Bethesda will touch it with a Ten Foot Cattle Prod.
---
Yeah I guess I payed for all the normal mods after hours of hopping
---
How much hunting rifle
---
What was the exploit?
---
Depends if you can inspect them after you get them while still keeping the dialog open. Then it could take forever - buy a 3\* melee, inspect it, decide you don't like it, sell it back for 40, etc. That could be done 16 times in a row. If you have to leave, yeah, it'll be a "spam the trade button" free-for-all unless someone deliberately holds it open without doing any transactions.
---
Actually, slugger applies. But it only does 29/29e damage for me. Might be from my fairly low strength. Still rips the bejeebus out of ghouls, I now use it as my golf course tool when I go there, a quick run through the upper floors and then back myself into a corner and hold down the button.
---
Apperantly another duping glitch emerged and they are fixing it way quick so glad they are on top of it
---
&gt; I've already referenced to these maps more times than I've been on pornhub today!
---
That's.... Great.
---
But regarding the other region types absolutely! That's what Mappalachia is built for. I'll add to my list. You may need to check the post because I have about 7-8 requests now and I'm not sure I can inform everyone who requested them.
---
Oh! Damn .   I was trying to do a good thing because so many couldn't find the tourist. :(
---
I bet there are many exploits running around.
---
If you and other people dupe, there will be massive banwave which will effect everyone including innocent players getting banned. Is that too hard to wrap your head around?
---
Ha, right! Pretty much my first thought too, like 'how much trouble am I going to be in for this'
---
I know. I mean, that line out of context sounds like you need to get a rolled up newspaper. :)
---
I cant view my pipboy while sitting or sleeping but I can view the map.
---
When will you relise this post was to just trigger little virgins like you 🤣👍
---
Anyone know what the exploit was?
---
I'm just curious.
---
I hope this doesn’t become s regular thing. They really should learn how to properly implement “hot fixes”  or even what a hot fix is.
---
The limiting factor is the amount of scrip you can get per day. 
---
It makes absolutely no sense to add a second barrier. The chances are also really low 1 in 63756 for a 3* ranged weapon. 
---
Besides, we'll only be able to buy 10 3* items/week. (and to be honest you can get more than that in a week just by farming...)
---
Companies seem really hesitant to include anything related to gambling in games these days so i doubt we will see that happen even though i do like the idea.
---
Reminds me of the scp tale where death wins
---
Of course found them and rabbit isn't giving me credit for the picture.
---
I typically pay and ask 1.5k per star. Good rolls I'll go as high as 2.5k per star. What system are you on and what's your game name. If you are on PC, send me a message when you open up your store.
---
Yup, I went from 150 to 900 or so...
---
Yeah I was struggling to kill scorched when I first started but once I got my hands on a shotgun and a fire axe my murdering capabilities drastically increased
---
I took my armor off and dropped a stim on the ground and ran up a tower. Random person there understood and immediately did the same for me. I think you’ve just had bad luck unfortunately.
---
I remember when nights were dark...
---
It grinds my gears when people can't place vending machines on visible place!
---
Which ione this time
---
Honestly, I haven’t claimed a public workshop in like 2 months. Even though it’s right down the street, my camp sits on a dedicated Junk extractor. So I’m covered as is.
---
I mean, do you have a source it was a duping glitch
---
Meh, dupe glitches don't bother me, there's always going to be one.
---
It’s more of a charge than a tax but it doesn’t matter what they do , you kids will cry about something . You would of thought repair kits were causing cancer or something a few weeks ago
---
Thanks I will give that a try.
---
Prob because of the new camp items like the topiary
---
Ammo for a cap each usually sells! I've noticed though some players want to try to sell ammo by the bulk so ie they put 2000 rounds up for sale and they intend to sell it ALL for 1000c in total but that's just not possible so what ends up happening is the price will be set to 1000c PER rou round... go fi,gure right? hah!. Anyways, essential junk like screws, springs, plastic, aluminum, ballistic fiber. Stimpaks, rad away, canned food sells quite good too. Weapons / Plans / Armor are its own entity. :)
---
They are banking on whales, which seems to be pretty safe these days. This is why I'm always baffled people get pissed by the exorbitant atom shop prices. That's how you're going to get free content. You don't have to buy those items, someone else will.
---
It's to patch a dupe exploit.
---
They announced it on twitter and on bethesda.net
---
*tilts T45 helmet* 
---
M' Appalachia
---
I guess if you translate the db into json or xml, this can be huge for sure!
---
But it's not like you try to do this in realtime, maps only need to be done occasionally.
---
Just for the heads up, SeventySix.esm is twice as big as the fallout4 one.
---
It's the biggest data ever done by bethesda for a game with that framework.
---
Great work, anyway :)
---
"To publicly identify or publish *private* information about (someone) especially as a form of punishment or revenge".
---
Either you need to improve your reading comprehension, or you need to try harder. I haven't done any of that.
---
It’s amazing what people are charging for basic legendary weapons.  I bought my first lvl 45 explosive shotgun for 500 caps.  A decent vampire handmade and 2 star fire axe for 300 caps total. Now?  Forget about it.
---
My AAE combat shotgun or AAE handmade are probably worth 20K caps each lol.  And then what will I do?
---
Depends on the receiver, same as any rifle that can have an auto receiver.
---
Think it was supposed to be 6 months after submitting a ticket but final submission was end of Jan. So maybe end of June / July, we'll hear?
---
There ARE 3 oil seeps at Wade Airport....so that part is actually pretty accurate. It's a big area, so you have to be diligent. (I think they are 1 on the side, and 2 at the opposite ends of the runway, IIRC)  The food and water was where I was getting hung up. It doesn't seem like you can get food or water from many of these places, and none of it is "farmable". It may suggest "nearby food sources", but still seems weird to be in the stats for a workshop.
---
Love me some firecracker juice - have to admit it's tempting to pop them instead of pick them.
---
That explains why they took the game down at the start of peak hours on a Friday.  Hopefully won't be too long of a fix.
---
My buddy and I finished Free Range with 20 seconds left!
---
Are we sure it’s a battle royale? If I recall, back when the game first launched they datamined Team Deathmatch type stuff that never ended up appearing. What if this is a deathmatch mode?
---
When you realise your completely in the wrong so you back out with "Its just a prank bro", your honestly sad and so not know my sexual habits.
---
Theres going to be that anyways it will always happen because someone will always find a new dupe glitch so what you gonna do when another ban wave comes out in 6 months or so the same shit will happen
---
Sometimes you want to go where everybody hunts for game...
---
I suppose I see your point, but there are areas on the map that have higher legendary spawn rates, like the Whitespring Golf Club and Watoga High school. Maybe the community could do some research? 
---
Honestly, it would probably be a pretty insignificant map tho. Up to you.
---
Is that what it was lol
---
I'm glad they're fixing an exploit but really ... 3 updates in 3 days?  And of course this is 10 minutes after I finish powering up Thunder Mountain solo and defeat the first wave of attackers after taking the base.  Got 2 fusion cores out of it at least.
---
It's going down to address an exploit. I don't think they had much more heads up than we did.
---
If there ever becomes a way to convert real world currency into caps (and back again), then the game would be covered under all the relevant gambling legislation in various countries across the globe. While you can't, it's possible, but I reckon it'll be a customer server nightmare. What if you crash with a great hand? What if the camp owner logs out while you're winning? I can't see it happening to be honest.
---
Yep.  This.  Please.  While you’re at it do another ban wave.  You can leave it off all day if you want just get rid of them all.
---
Seems to be a regular thing this week :|
---
Just did it on Xbox with a random person. Makes it easy when you can look through the LFG’s.
---
"Why didn't Bethesda ask when it's convenient for me!?"
---
https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1126927531423219712
---
Short-notice shutdowns like this aren't meant to be the norm; they're just fixing a duping glitch that popped up.  I'm happy they're getting rid of it ASAP instead of giving the dupers a heads up and letting them have enough time to abuse it.
---
See, it wasn't happening to any other items, and despite it acting like I had all the holotapes, they aren't actually usable. We're down for maintenance now though, so maybe they're fixing it right now, lol
---
Does it specifically have to be a Mike? How about a Steve or a Dave?
---
True that. Maybe they’ll take the duped items out of the game and finally put an end to this bs.
---
Hear hear!!
---
Hurr durr bethesda why does a multiplayer game force me to play with others hurrrr. 
---
Deal with it bro its an online game
---
It should be done repetitively. I hope no one broke it.
---
Maybe he's a Dollar General store?
---
Magazines that I need to complete the atom challenges, I’m literally missing 1 or 2 of each category and I always find the same ones all the time, I’ve been putting mine in my vending machine and I’m hoping to stumble across others that are doing the same on my bargain hunting travels lol
---
It is a multiplayer game...if u want single player so much to play fallout 4. 🙈
---
Except, there doesn't seem to be a food or water source at most of these locations...to produce food at any velocity... =/
---
Sadly
---
You have to make sure the name pops up in the top corner.  Sometimes even when it is just take a few pictures and it’ll work!
---
First time they have done it with short notice, it has always been know a day in advance for hot fixes. 
---
Calm down, no need to get all worked up the first time.
---
My camp spawns then all the time. It’s wolf central up in this piece!
---
SOMEWHERE IN APPALACHIA!
---
Oh, huh! Yeah, I've been in the same session all day, so maybe it'll fix itself when I go back on then : O
---
No i know the dupe glitch and use it everyday thanks and no your the sad one for getting so fucking triggered by this post 🤣 dont fuck your game disc so hard you might snap it
---
whats your platform?
---
  You should stay in the forest/light green area/left side/west of the map for at least the first 15 levels.  If you are in the black, beige, dark green, red, or eastern side of the map, you are likely in the wrong place.
---
Follow the overseers quest - it will generally keep you in level appropriate areas.  
---
  Most of the enemies you find should be L6 or lower scorched, L5 mutants,  and L5 robots.  If you are finding anything over L10, you are probably not in an area appropriate for your level.
---
A a machete, hatchet, or fire axe are your friends.  They use no ammo, and are reasonably effective. 
---
The greyish scorched corpses (the ones that look like statues and have bright green protrusions) will poof and blow radioactive dust on you if you search, inspect, hit, or even stand next to them for too long. 
---
there are lots of first aid boxes at Morgantown airport (but there are also lots of scorched, especially when the event starts.

---
Some comments are saying it's because of a dupe glitch.
---
Yeah.  I was sharing Nuke zone kills with a guy and we started talking on our mics about the Scouts quest.   We joined a team then let the glowing ghouls kill one of us and then be revived by the other.  
---
I went first, then him.   
---
I joked with him that it was a good thing that I didn’t decide to switch from a Ranger to a Raider at that point.   I could have just left him for dead having already gotten what I needed....   ;)
---
You definitely need a mic in this game.  Not all of the time, but there are times when it’s necessary.   Even a cheap mic is better than nothing.
---
Don't mind my silly humor, I was just an expression of how very excited I was to see these maps! Thank you again, I'll be using them very often.
---
They seem to use the same amount of budget, so try like, two missile turrets and see how it goes.
---
They announced it like 30 mins before bringing the servers down, so seems to be an unanticipated downtime... my issue was I wasn't checking twitter for server news as I was in-game about to run a mine, imagine my surprise when I got a 5 mins warning that the server was shutting down
---
There is none, that's not a thing.
---
That being said, remember there are only 24ish people you'll be competing with, and I doubt all of them will be doing it at the same time.  It might take 10-15 minutes if there's a crowd, but it shouldn't be all that bad.
---
If we could play poker and have Individuals organise them prizes etc that would be pretty dope
---
I spawned in some guys locked off area with his extractor and water producers. I couldn't leave and he wasn't home. I felt like the best burglar.
---
fug, dont worry about it, PS4 here
---
a better solution imo would have been to make us choose one star on an existing weapon in our inventory and change that into a random other effect therefore you could have slowly created your weapon/armor of choice and second ability should have been to upgrade a legendarys level
---
prices would have needed a good balance though
---
Do we know why they shut er down again so soon?
---
Nice! I cant get it yet bcs i have a bug that ive seen a few people get that stops you getting the daily quests.
---
Bethesda took it for scheduled maintenance. Visit the Fallout 76 forums for updates.
---
You do know its not always pre-scheduled right? Its a hotfix because they need to act as quick as possible.
---
Probably. My normal evening gaming runs 8pm-10pm EDT because I'm a sad old man who gets up at 6am, but it's Friday so chances are good I'll still be on (assuming you meant E**D**T, since it's daylight savings time already)
---
Go into your pipboy I'm pretty sure there's a way to quit events.  People did it to me during the survival weekly challenge to do events.
---
I’m pretty sure what Fatal commented is a meme. I think I saw it on /r/BrandNewSentence or /r/RareInsults
---
Antique also has a spawn chance for BoS lab coat
---
Personally my favourite location is the savage divide. Advantages are: better view, all around decent cost for fast travel, Near whitespring, nice looking trees, good looking water unlike the toxic valley. Only disadvantage is that it’s basically the forest region with more mountains. The mire is the coolest looking location in my opinion
---
Thought I was crazy on that one.
---
Nothing like a little melee  to get the blood going
---
That's fair man, first iterations can be pretty rough. Thank you for the explanation. :)
---
Fuck yeah. And more speak easy style camp items.
---
If your playing PS4 I can help with that
---
BOS upgrade significantly increases the armors ability to shield and protect in many cases close to almost doubling it so how is it not a factor? 
---
Just curious why you think it’s irrelevant and asking, not picking a fight...lol
---
I only just finished it when the servers kicked me, I saw my reward, but it was so close to server end im scared I wont get the plans
---
fingers crossed!
---
Emergency patch for an exploit
---
I think there must be a time reset for materials in that and some of the other mining events. I notice if I do multiple in a few hours it doesn't pay out.
---
.....and full of terrors?
---
You need to follow them on twitter and turn notifications on. Very useful
---
Lol, true. I am bummed though, yesterday and today are my days off this week so bad luck for me, lol.
---
ISN’T THIS GAME WONDERFUL.
---
(I do love this game to bits. I just want to strangle it sometimes lol.)
---
I was postponing lifesaving surgery. Now the server's are down I should probably see to that patient.
---
I agree there should be a text chat, probably one that only goes so far for general chat. Let players talk over the whole map only through direct messages.
---
However, saying people just dont have mics is not a point to be made. According to Steam's survey and that I'd imagine a majority if not all of 76 players also have Steam on their PC, 99.82% of users have mics. The argument needs to be made with points that aren't moot such as saying you can be more direct with text chat. Text chat can be used as a log to remember things. It's much easier to moderate a text chat than mic chat if you dont want players to be toxic. 
---
There has to be a reason Bethesda clings to only having mic chat as modders have implemented one on the past. There needs to be a better reason.
---
Lotta people being salty right out the gate. Well I'll indulge.
---
I'm 27, have an active life but I always find a way to make time for my fallout games.
---
I was an elder scrolls fan since the age of 13, had no clue what Fallout was though. I was in my first year of college, a broke student in the dorms and I couldn't afford new games. A friend of mine lent a pile of games he was done with, and in the stack was a copy of New Vegas. I checked it out, and instantly fell in love. Played through the story once, went out and bought my own copy, then I looked it up and found out about Fallout 3. I was hooked. Played the two of them dozens of times over.
---
Fallout 4 was the first game I religiously followed news of leasing up to release, and was actually the reason I discovered reddit (cause that's where all the speculation and tidbits were coming from).
---
God, I put maybe 2000 hours into fallout 4. Now I'm loving 76, been playing since the beta, stuck through the rocky launch and now it's honestly my favorite game on the market right now.
---
I've been buying really crap \*\*\* weapons like boxing gloves and canes for 50-100 caps to turn into the legendary exchange.
---
Looks great. I'd pay some atoms for that.
---
That was my guess, too. Seems like the vending machines maybe re-enabled one of the old dupe bugs that involve transferring an item from player A to player B and then forcing the system to rollback player B to where they still had the item.
---
That door is literally the only thing in my Camp that's locked, not even my Extractor or purifiers (hate it when people lock their water, seems like a dick move considering how quick they refill) and it's only because the switch for advertising my camp is behind it. Pretty sure it's only like a lvl 1 lock too, just for discouragement 🤣 Before that I didn't even bother and just left everything wide open
---
I've never gotten anything good from finding a treasure  on a treasure map ... why are they sought after? I sold all my duplicates, and yes I know I can reuse them but like I said I've never gotten anything of value
---
U ain't lying
---
Oh man, that's amazing.
---
You're taking it pretty cool.
---
I am deaf so it is impossible to have a verbal conversation with someone online.
---
I’m going to guess a dupe glitch. That would explain the high number of server crashes.
---
The last four days have had me pulling my hair out.  But it’s been worth it!
---
I validated my game files and it started working.
---
Before that i was instant disconnected the second i pressed play
---
I always wonder, if these knuckleheads can find these exploits so quickly, why isn't Bethesda hiring these knuckleheads?
---
I just used 3 of the premium repair kits after a couple kills each time to get the 3 repairs. I do enough queen's to have plenty. Suggest everyone else do the same to save time if they can.
---
Nope. It is 'a thing'.
---
And with the new questline spawning/requiring loot from nothing but flying mobs is getting old... fast.
---
I wasn't being cynical, I genuinely though they would be all over this one.
---
Yes I know, I was just excited to play!
---
If you are on Xbox I sell them cheap every time I find them.
---
Keep in mind they don’t have to be in water, you do. Some guy built a tower along the river and it took us a while to figure that out.
---
For the new Pioneer Scout fetch challenges, this would be extremely useful.  Looking at you, Deathclaw Hides!
---
Miner hat and tactical underarmor?
---
Things are jumpy because of how you are responding.
---
by lvl 15 and with a pump shotgun i was ok, but yeah, much more dicey that the "old" airport interior
---
They fixed a bug (nerfed) explosive shotguns.  Maybe that's why?
---
Was a big fan of the junk/lead combo spot before it became too popular (and I went to mainly melee)
---
Great job! 
---
I've had an idea for a web app for a bit, and I'd like to know what you think.
---
It would allow users to select types of materials, and the app would show junk objects that contain those materials with a weight to material ratio. Then it would show locations on the map where those objects spawn, and create farming routes dynamically. It could also list enemies that typically drop items that scrap into the sought-after materials, and add those to the farming routes. Each route could have an efficiency rating based on weight to junk, and the length of the route. 
---
It could also be setup to allow users to select specific things they want to craft, and then suggest routes based on that, instead of just material farms. Say you want to farm a specific type of ammo. It could create routes to farm each component of that ammo, with a bias to kill enemies that typically drop that ammo type.
---
This is an app I've wanted to build for a few months, but I wasn't sure how to go about getting the data. If you're interested in making something like that, go right ahead. I'm not the kind of person that'll get butt hurt if you make my idea. But I would love to help out with front end design if you make it.
---
Thanks for the info. Time for more Doom🤘
---
God I hope this is real
---
The issue I was having with it wasn't that it wasn't working it was that I was aggroing enemies way too easily when I was already hidden. I would have every enemy in a place going into danger as soon as I'd get in line of sight even in the dark and they'd all be on me like I just sprinted through the place insulting their mom. I'd stand and crouch out of sight and go back to hidden immediately but then as soon as I'd get back within line of sight they'd be in danger again. Without escape artist active I'd stay in caution pretty much the whole time I was clearing a place as long as I kept 25ft or so distance and used a silent weapon. I will have to try it again though and see if that issue is gone.
---
Are you PS4 if so I sell all plans 50% off except pianos which I sell for 300 caps instead of 350
---
Auction house wouldnt really fit to the lore.
---
There is no internet
---
Duping at least thats speculation
---
here is the post on their forums with the videos  [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/341212/non-robot-legendary-enemies-are-exploding-on-death?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/341212/non-robot-legendary-enemies-are-exploding-on-death?language%5B%5D=en)
---
meh, caps are useless.
---
I knew it and have been saying this for a while now. People that get how exploits/dupes/glitches work could have seen this coming a mile away.
---
:shrug. I've no idea what triggers this. The first time i was there doing the responders missions it was the same as always. went back after competing some more things and this happened. perhaps its progression based? level based? idk...
---
What studios have published a multi-player installment in a long running singe-player franchise and abandoned it faster than 76 has been out (~7 months now)?  I can't think of any.
---
Or, literally, any IP with &gt;2 installments that had a game abandoned in the first half year or so?  Many studios could have?  Yeah?  None have unless I've missed something.  Even Anthem isn't abandoned yet (officially, it should be) - but that's a new IP and not in any way comparable to this.
---
The old too big to fail cliche is what's coming to mind here.  If they walked away from this game after a month, they would've damaged the brand even more.  Instead, they did what developers do, and worked on their game.
---
This isn't anything special or commendable.  They sold us a completely unfinished product (amongst other things) and instead of continuing to decimate their customer base, they continued developing the latest installment of an extremely lucrative IP.
---
I mean, what's commendable here?  What IP's comparable to fallout have seen installments and been abandoned in half a year?  Zero?
---
Cool.  Mediocrity ahoy!  Stop jerking off people that fucked you and everyone that bought this game over.  It's great that 76 is becoming something it should have fucking been before they asked people to pay full price to beta test it.
---
Duping
---
Twitter is evil and it is my belief that people are better when they don't use it.  I'm also not part of the "social media generation".
---
Plasma cores and flux
---
I’m on PS4 btw
---
Leader of the pack event is very common in the forest
---
Does it increase your carry weight at all?
---
You’re right, you should go around and leave bags of fertiliser and tp in the vamps of anyone with cat topiary. ;)
---
great idea have my upvote man!
---
I hate it cause we cant go 5 mins with out someone trying to dupe they dont understand the market wont be real if everyone has one of each gun
---
I haven't touched that event since it ate my rifle back in December. I don't trust it.
---
Neet
---
Same here. Xbox one. Had 350 stuck in my stash that I then couldn't get out.
---
I don't use twitter myself, I literally only follow Bethesda and ea sports for game notifications. Have absolutely no idea how to use it other than that.
---
Ahaha idk what that means.... There's nuclear powered robots everywhere, just have one of them keeping a ledger. 
---
I think internet is not a very big concern in a world where nukes get dropped every hour or so.
---
Excuse my ignorance but what exactly is duping. Like I get people are making duplicates but how does it even work?
---
I ended up moving mine yesterday after months too. I was able to move six out of fifteen foundations worth of stuff, so had to mostly rebuild again. Nbd but would be nice to at least see if stuff is place-able beforehand.
---
I was referring to your FO3 disc ;)
---
Aw crap! I put one on my bed at my camp!!
---
Hopefully it's back up soonish if it's just a small fix, I've been gagging to play all week but haven't been able to. I want that backpack!
---
You got jokes! Well played...
---
Savage Divide here, too. It's convenient to the whole map. I've got a spot by an unmarked pond that I just can't beat, and given how rarely I have to server hop to place my CAMP, it's either an undiscovered treasure or I don't realize it actually sucks. But I don't want to spill on exactly where it is so it stays undiscovered.
---
nah.
---
Seems like good balance to me!
---
Ha yes
---
BOS no longer holds any real value. The plans are now easily available and dirt cheap. Anyone can add BOS to all their combat armor for 300 caps (for plans) plus mats. Deep pocketed may hold some value, since those plans cost 800ish caps a piece.
---
In general 1\* unyielding have little value. They are common. Probably price them at 500-1000 caps.
---
2\* unyielding has some value but that depends on the 2nd effect. Price stat secondaries at 1500-2000 caps. AP refresh is nicer and I would price that on an unyielding piece at 3000-4000 caps.
---
3\* pieces that have weight reduction tertiary stats I would price at 4-6k
---
So what's wrong with Super Duper just because I can duplicate items don't hate.
---
'Scheduled maintenance'? 
---
It's outside of their normal maintenance.
---
I was on 30mins ago and there was no message the maintenance was coming.
---
They had maintenance yesterday (also outside their normal schedule).
---
It seems like unscheduled maintenance.
---
I don't really have a roof on most of mine, let alone a doors ... nothing locks ... come on in ;-)
---
Negative, I'm on PC. I work for my stock.
---
This doesnt work on PS4 or at least I have never gotten it to work.  People still spawn where I origionally placed my C.A.M.P. even though it is now like 50 yards away from where it was first placed.  
---
Wish they would just give us floor markers so we could decide exactly where we want people to spawn.
---
Same here, Thursdays and Fridays are my weekend lol.
---
It "kinda" works on XB. I fiddled with it enough that instead of spawning me in a bush outside, I can actually spawn inside on my stairs.
---
Maybe this will now become enough of an issue they'll give us the travel mats back.
---
I posted about 1 hour ago about the fact that i have a High Capacity Backpack MOD PLAN. They probably realized that's a huge middle finger to all the grinders out there. Too bad they're not so fast with fixing the fucking challenges for the mods though
---
AW MAN, it doesn't count for the Possum challenge? :(
---
Are you on PC? I have found several broken deluxe cameras I can use to make working cameras I can then drop for you. Just need some silver.
---
We are aware of this and investigating it.
---
I think it'd be nice to know how long your server you just joined has been up, but isn't it like a set amount of hours per server? I could be wrong, just what I thought.

nah i had it in background and it def wasn't 30 mins i alt tab back and i got kicked
---
This is wonderful! I’ve been hoping something like this comes along, most comprehensive map I’ve seen so far.
---
PSA: This is the only known method to tame animals and wasteland monsters.
---
While it may be an inconvenient time, I’d rather have them fix the issue now before it turns into an even bigger issue. I’ve been getting disconnected repeatedly the past few days, as well as, having really bad lag issues. Personally, I’m glad to see they’re on top of this instead of waiting days or weeks to fix it.
---
Oh, damn... my wife's gatling went missing last night, and we did that event amongst others. Wonder if this is the culprit.
---
Gotta be this ain't , he didn't say he had no fucking dollar tree, and dollar store applies to dollar general lol this guy
---
Yep I noticed it started doin this when I did the weekly survival getting beer bottles. They would be there and when the place fully loaded in I’d watch them vanish. Can’t server hope for stuff anymore I guess
---
I just said that because that's what their notifier says, and I was just making a joke about his FO3 disk.
---
Or the gliding sleeping ghouls 😁
---
And on your cake day. I'd say have a good one, but I can see you're doing that already.
---
Fo76map.com. Thank me later :3
---
I believe Lucky Hole Mine is chock full of them.
---
It's simple.  It's not rare anymore. It's trivial to acquire the plan now.
---
*Cleanliness is Godliness.*
---
Lucky hole mine.
---
Sure no problem   :)  I was exploring south of vault 96, walking along the border and seen someones base and noticed they had a lead extractor which surprised me because I've payed close attention to your map and realised there wasnt a purple dot marked. When I'm on tonight I can go and get some screen shots or something, or what would be the best way to show you
---
Investigators cabin that’s how I got mine today.
---
I guess they discovered a duper glitch and had to shut down to fix it. Fucking dupers.
---
I was in the same boat as you for days and then I read that he spawns at the colonel Kelly monument more often than anywhere else. I don’t know how true this was but I found him on my second server hop there
---
Hey man, it's not my fault the cat topiaries weren't in the atomic shop.
---
Well my source is quotes from the devs and your source is your ass so Ill keep believing that private servers are on track to come out this year. Thats a lot of hyperbolic speculation youre spewing. Also the article already confirms that private servers will exist separately from live you would be making a new character on whatever server you decide to join, but thats how it should be. Private servers are a feature that primarily exist on PC so I dont see why console players would be upset about it with this game since thats how it is with most other games. I wouldnt be surprised if private servers got pushed back at some point since youre right about development being slow but they have high incentive to finish that feature since its what keeps their other games in the ether. Dont know why this made you so butthurt wasnt trying to start an argument.
---
I wish someone would datamine that info so the guesswork can be taken out of the equation.
---
Well, if you ever need an extra hand with testing or double checking new additions just let me know, I'm more than happy to do some of the grunt work that has to go into it since I'm a little OCD about understanding the underlying mechanics.
---
I'm going to do a bit of afk browsing.
---
How many atoms is the hat?
---
Why pianos?
---
this is what happens when every update is released, the hacks that can't play the game try all the old dupe methods and if one works they go nuts until BGS catches up. They aren't in the game to enjoy it they are playing to get an irrational boost to their egos from exploiting a game for their own advantage. Look to any FPS game where aimbots have ruined the game, these  unskilled players think they are better players because a program is doing all the work.
---
He's dying inside.
---
Excavator PA + Lucky Hole Mine = 350-400 Lead Ores
---
I couldn't tell you where exactly but nuka shine took me to one in toxic valley. Actually think it's around the same area as the new pioneer scout camp.
---
If that is the case it is a bit... anticlimactic.
---
Last time I 'saw' them do this was when the artillery box duping glitch went supersonic.
---
People 'illegitimately' learning a bunch of mods... I don't know... to me that is a different category than 10k TSE weapons TBH.
---
Maybe. there is a jacket and pants set (wanderer, maybe" that I am going to check out.
---
I am assuming none of you have played the other fallouts? 1 cap for each piece of single ammo is cheap compare to the vendors in Fallout 3, 4, New Vegas or 76. If you want to give away ammo for free throw a bag down by your shop.
---
What did it cost?
---
lucky hole mines lead paradise
---
I dont it's the duping. You could get PLANS for the backpack mods as soon as you unlocked them with badges.
---
Idk they’re more special I guess. They are still at a discount as all those plans are ones that I know and can’t sell anyway
---
I really wonder how many items in the game are duped.
---
Maybe 25 dude, but 100 is insane.
---
This guy is spot on. You won't be disappointed
---
I think its 400 caps.  Hell it could have been more, I just bought it straight up no caring the cost.
---
Or gal
---
Twitter alerts aren't an acceptable method of updating players, anyway. Not everyone is plugged into twitter 24/7 -- I don't even have an account.
---
Ah don't feel bad. I fat fingered a few buttons trying to deploy my badass excavator power armor and destroyed that shit lol.
---
Morgantown ghouls are a good source of Radaway and Rad-X. 
---
Get the pharma farmer and scrounger perks for scaving chems and ammo respectively. 
---
Also use the hunting rifle. It'll break you of the spray and pray mentality to help with ammo consumption. 
---
And always have a melee good to go. In fact always have that in hand, or at least the first to pull up when you engage anything. If things are out of melee range, you'll have plenty of time to switch, if things pop up and catch you off guard, you're better off meleeing them.
---
They could make it so that the fast travel point can only be placed on dirt? It wouldn't be an ideal solution by any means, but it would work. Perhaps it could be turned into another sort of object so it'd look more natural to have it outside though, rather than a welcome mat. Maybe the new datamined mailbox CAMP items will work as fast travel points.
---
Furious or bloodied would probably be best, so those apply to the same logic of everyone would have those
---
You will have to define sorry my memory ain’t so good when it comes to locations
---
Ouch
---
No, it's locked to the character.
---
Go into camp editing mode look at the terminal, and there's an option to lock. I can't remember the exact button off hand, but it's either L1 or LB. From there a box pops up and you can select a lock level of 0-3.
---
just click on shias name and there should be a option to PM and send it there , but if you have s cool cosplay you could start a thread of your own or just host the image on imgur and drop a link in this thread .  I have the same pipboy I havent put it together yet but I'm it's on my list of things to do.
---
 me and Shia do little arts and crafts projects for each other (usually centered around fallout which we love ) so we have little shrines as well .
---
As soon as I can I'll see what else I can find
---
I’m not talking about today. I mean other days when an individual server randomly goes down for maintenance. Today made me think about those times and brought up the idea.
---
But what if we opted not to nuke Whitesprings and instead choose to nuke teammates C.A.M.P.  For you know, reasons and stuff.
---
Doesn't matter, they're sitting at home wondering if they got banned because they can't log in!
---
#5 literally makes me 3-4k richer every time I do it :)
---
Well hello there, I’m Sup3rm4nTM and love the idea your doing.  I’m a big fallout fan since 3 as well back when there was level caps and karma.  I played new Vegas and 4 also but 3 has to be my favorite because of Herbert.   That super mutant stuck in a tree was my favorite quest to do putting all dlcs aside.  His story was so sad and if you helped him you doomed his followers.
---
Found mine at colonel Kelly monument as well!
---
It didn't for me when I did this yesterday. But somewhere in this thread is another player claiming that it worked for him. So maybe it depends on the system, the kind of magazine, or something entirely different we didn't think of. I tried it with an Unstoppables comic, and it didn't count towards the collector badge.
---
See what I’m saying
---
The bot in the station was loaded with them and so was the materials bot in artisans corner last night on the server I was on. I guess some people either don't know, or they are at weight limit and stash limit and got all their daily scrip.
---
Even if it didn't already signify something hilarious, the word "queef" alone has got to be one of the funniest in the English language.
---
You can hang power armor now?

Right?!  I hate dupers!!  They cause so many issues and ruin things for legit players. They are lazy, inconsiderate, idiots!  😡
---
I hate that I can't upvote this more I LOVE THAT NAME HAHAHA
---
How do you know hot to price things? I find it challenging to know what I should ask for 3 star items like Tse, assassin armor with one star, the space suite, plans like the cuckoo clock etc... Are you using the market place to find ish prices, or are you just winging it?
---
So far you can't sell them to vendors , but you can make your own vendor machine and sell them to players
---
No. One is near the vault and the other is all the way over by the observatory. It seems like it's just the act of switching between alts at all?
---
Cool, thanks, it’s all legendary stuff no plain pieces at all. Appreciate the help!

That would definitely be nice. I’m not sure what triggers the shutdown of individual servers. It seems to happen when server population is lowest.

now we can! 
---
:)
---
Maybe 50%? 25 is still low compared to BE
---
Yah, I thought BOS combat armor was some of the best in terms of resistance.
---
For level 50+ stuff I would say 500ish caps per star with a 500ish cap premium for unyeilding and weightless and weight reduction.
---
Don't drop it from your inventory (X button on xbox), You have to place it ( A button) and it cannot be stolen
---
So where is the flatwoods
---
I know a guy that does it. You can basically ask him for any roll you want and he'll have it for you on a couple of days. I stay well clear from anything he 'makes', but a couple of friends have his wares.
---
Damn, I was wishing it wasn’t just that. Thank you. No I know what risk I run when swapping lol.
---
I have produced much purified water from just about every workshop. You have to build them in all but 1, the number applies to the rate of water producable(per hour?) Food is the same, but only affects plants you, yourself plant. Any preexisting plants run on normal world replenishment rates.
---
I heard that using strength chems, armour with St +1  and bobbleheads to get to the required strength, will trigger the challenge.
---
Bummer to see the game down, just finished my final paper and wanted to celebrate. But I'm much happier to see that they are tackling the dupe before it goes out of control like last time
---
I guess people haven’t learned with the last 
---
Wave of bans then. Unless it was accidentally found and reported.
---
I think people need to realize that while cool weapons are great to buy, as with all games of this ilk there is a chance anything you buy could be worthless after the next find. So people really need to come down on their prices. I think people are assuming everyone out there is a millionaires. And this is especially true of lower levels. Im sorry but your level 20 combat rifle is not worth having 1000 caps and as for the higher up peeps, most legendarys aren't worth 3500 either. Just saying, don't let greed ruin your stores my friends. 
---
Personally I just sell 10 cap magazines and 1 cap ammo, any kind you need, all with a free side of rad stag.
---
Well that explains the emergency maintinence we now have.
---
I thought I experienced something similar yesterday. Didn't wanna explore it due to possible banning.
---
Forest, near the lighthouse, by the river. Built my CAMP there and never moved it. Lots of water, space for crops and I can do a run down the river to get all the plants to make Disease Cure, Radaway and Healing Salve.
---
Thank you! Good advice 🙂👍
---
I'm trying. 😅
---
I stole a suit of X-01 off an enclave player that dropped it.
---
Going to need a new game engine if you want more than one camp in an area.
---
I was randomly crafting .45 ammo as the timer popped up, my lead, gunpowder and Steel were all decreasing.
---
Ive never heard of this actually happening and ive been around since beta lol
---
I would love it if Bethesda employees logged in and bought the weapons to see the dupers and give them the ban hammer.
---
I've been alone on a server for a few hours before, and on servers full of people that got shut down, so I don't think population matters.
---
Up for a bigger budget so long as it doesn't effect performance
---
**finding it ironic the responder is saying this**
---
It's not Fallout 5, if that's what you're expecting. You're not the hero of the story. You're just one more vault dweller. I liked the story, but some may not because you actually have to read stuff. There's no handholding npc's around.
---
Yes. Bullets ammo. Something that has truly never been done before, this could be groundbreaking for the community
---
I didn't think you could scrap legendary stuff.
---
I'm just gonna tell you this. There's alot more wild razor grain than that 2/5 D for effort.
---
It's also the go to spot for cement. Top of the elevator closest to the road.
---
I think they added them as drops in some containers so people can find them easier.
---
this is the first im hearing of it..
---
Dupers: *dupes*
---
Bethesda: *triggered war noises*
---
Also Bethesda: *tumbleweeds roll by when pointed to progression breaking bugs*
---
Brick glitch?
---
I tried to mash like on this reply so much, but evidently I can only upvote a single tick. Have my virtual 1000 upvote.
---
maybe
---
I guess if you paint it and try to drop it does
---
This is amazing.
---
Is there a map of stash boxes?
---
The most resounding disproval of a statement I've ever heard. You should be a lobbyist.
---
Because there are a million monkeys pounding on keyboards and throwing poo at the walls, and you only want the one that happens to type out Macbeth.
---
&gt; Which removes its utility in combat. So I/O does have something to do with it.
---
I already stated that for a fast paced game like Overwatch, it's pretty clear how much a text chat would negatively impact gameplay by slow typing, but Fallout 76 is a LOUNGE type game for the majority of the time playing it. The amount of time it takes to type is irrelevant in this type of game, and it's not at all necessary in this game to type during combat. Even just using emotes in combat can be suicidal.
---
&gt; Also, it already being present natively on the console platforms means they didn't feel any need to re-make the wheel.
---
What...? There's a major difference between a ingame chat and a chat that's completely outside the game itself. Just about no one is going to message someone on psn for everything, as the effort is just plain ridiculous to do each time for someone you don't have on your friends list. Ps4 messages is like using discord, and then you have Party chat for using mics. There's nothing to remake as there's no ingame chat at all for Fallout 76.
---
The day that vending machines came out one of the first camps I went to had 4 machines set up. The dude who owned the camp had thousands if not tens of thousands of materials, ammo, chems and other things. I couldn't believe how much stuff he had or how it was even possible. He also dropped 2k 2mm cartridges for the hell of it. My carry weight went over the limit by more than 200 lbs. I dropped the ammo and didn't buy anything from him. [I took a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/nPSErN1).
---
I started seeing a lot of tse lasers offered and in game, figured duping was back.
---
Duplication exploit.
---
Noice
---
I wouldn’t ban those who bought them. They don’t necessarily know that it’s a duped item. I can understand deleting the items and ban the duper but I don’t think it’s right to ban the buyer.
---
I knew it...suddenly everyone has legacy explosive lasers
---
What is Game Night???!!!
---
oh. Putting an atom paint on it will kill it when dropped for sure.
---
Some other useful primary effects that have value are Vanguards, Bolstering, cloaking, and weightless. Assassins is only valued if combined with Sent or Cav. Creature specific effects don't hold much value.
---
Depends on the ammo, yea...I mean, I had a dude buy all 2000+ rounds of .44 I had for sale yesterday.  
---
Should be comparable bulk as to what you can craft at a tinker bench. I'd gladly buy 1k of 5mm or 5.56 for  500-600caps.
---
I've got over 700 hours in game and don't know what the brick glitch is either.
---
"I have 42069 hours in Fallout 76 and I once jumped in front of a bullet to save Todd Howard's life, and now I am banned for absolutely no reason"
---
*2 hours later*
---
Kotaku: "Todd Howard banned an honest innocent player he owes his life to in order to sell pay-to-win microtransactions in Fallout76"
---
yes. what are you doing in the game?
---
Someone give this person a Pioneer Scout badge!
---
I appreciate the effort, but you know this wont stop people asking the same question.
---
Did you try putting it into a world container and taking it out that way?
---
I think it drops more toward the holiday season.
---
this is why i carry bottles of toxic and dirty water exclusively and no purified
---
Might be nice if this was a sticky, this would help many people.
---
&gt; has anyone heard Bethesda state why it’s been going down?
---
This is the problem. People will go to reddit, open this subreddit, create a post with 100+ words wondering what is happening, when you could just google for the community forum and get the answer in like 15 seconds
---
There r bricks in this game?
---
Yeah but what about the poor bastards that buy their stuff? Not really fair to them for Bethesda to let the dupers keep duping, then remove the weapons after they buy them.
---
And this ladies and gents is what happens when you let technology entertain your children 24/7 instead of showing them attention lmao
---
The glitch is supposed to brick your system/console
---
Nah that semantics doesn't quite fit. They're not mutually exclusive. Maintenance where I come from is the act of taking a system or part of system out of active service. What you do during maintenance can be anything including an emergency patch.
---
Excellent work!
---
😲 I did that too!! This is worse than we imagined.. 😥
---
I was in the middle of the campfire tales event 😢
---
They really just need to have the tourists spawn in static locations. I can't find them either after a few weeks looking. I server hopped for an hour again last night and no luck.  It's frustrating when numerous challenges require the camera.
---
This also works with the Crossbow challenge
---
I set my current base 3x3, 2 stories (though I use the roof as space).  And that's too much space, I had trouble figuring out how to fill it.
---
However, I built using 1 foundation piece.  It's efficient.
---
Last place I visited was on a flat, and they had 4x6 or 5x6 foundation pieces before they even placed a wall.  That *really* eats into your potential.  Another one had what looked like a long paragraph written out in neon lights...I'm surprised they had enough budget for the walls to mount them on.
---
You're right, but now I have a link to post as a reply, rather than just saying "FOR FUCK'S SAKE USE THE SEARCH FUNCTION."  :-)
---
Yeah me too...i just have no idea what to do with them. I already have a camera. Id be nice if u could scrap them and learn the plans for other lenses
---
Love the idea and I know the pain of losing a pet deathclaw
---
No, I just dropped it and picked it up. I will have to try that when the servers come back up, thanks a lot!
---
I never noticed that picking up wet kindling was what spawned the bugs.  I'm usually in such a hurry that I just grab everything.
---
Kill two birds with one stone and post the maps on pornhub?
---
I hate those posts. Like really why do they even post. If u want to find out go play. Not like the community will ever day...ya sucks dont play.
---
Again I have to say I hate those posts. Idiots. I kinda want to tell them not to play.
---
Bethesda has never done testing and I don't see why would they start now. Their company policy is to create as cheap products as possible and push these products to the markets as fast as possible. After that they let players do testing. Then if there is enough people complaining about some problems Bethesda will cherry pick some problems that are easy and cheap to fix.
---
Preach
---
xD
---
I actually feel guilty if I don't get a good weapon I'm never going to use out there in the world for someone else to enjoy.
---
Nice.
---
Blast radius works for every grenade I've thrown. The larger radius on the orbital strikes are a sight to see.
---
Paint me like one of your bandits
---
If it works, let me know!  ;)
---
But I'm a special snowflake and I need to know if it is worth buying/coming back for ME.
---
And dont forget all those anti armor/bloodied handmades. Although, I did get a sweet lever action out of the whole ordeal
---
2000 ammo 5.56 for the price of 2:1 sold out in 15 minutes. I think 1:1 is not for these ammo)
---
I could use a couple pieces for when I get back out of the power armor. Gt?
---
Why though? Doesn't that take longer? I just got it down to low health with my gatling plasma and finished it off while sitting on top of a car with a bleedout syringer. Still took like 40 syringes tho lol
---
what platform...
---
great job !
---
My camp is a 3 story round building over water with wire chases. It's like 22 blueprints.  If you spawn wrong, you're screwed.  Had to make some unwanted modifications so people dont get stuck in a crawlspace.  Suuuuuuucked.
---
Maybe after the maintenance if we build the stupid frog habitat it’ll actually say we crafted it
---
Total silence. No tweeting birds. No scuttering of critters. No voice of ones opinion. A world once thriving with life has now met its ultimate demise. Nothingness.
---
Remnants of the past still stand strong in the land of the wastes. Buildings that once held a purpose, were now boxes of history from a bygone era. Tools that were once used by humans, now lying there with noone to hold them. Corpses, bones, dust, residue once home to living creatures, now home to the very foundations of humanity...
---
Soil.
---
 Calling this a dark age is a mere understatement. There is no more age, no more  time, no life to put things right. Not a single soul to care for this world.
---
This world is nothing... 
---
And it cant be undone.
---
Instead of banning dupers, hire them lol I would get the best dupers - glitch pros. They can go though releases, patches and make sure it can't happen.
---
I haven’t played since right before the server went down for maintenance 30 minutes ago. Still think it’s worth playing?
---
Mutant and proud!
---
I don't think they care about selling for caps. Most of those traders have maxed caps on a full set of characters and maybe even max caps on a secondary set of characters. Selling an item for 25k doesn't matter when you already have 300k. The top traders are all just trading among themselves for high end items.
---
I think that might of been anthem.
---
I'm for this idea, but I would also like to see them add craftable arcade cabinets for individual games that vistors can play regardless if they have the holotape or not. Maybe even set it up to accept caps that can be collected by the camp's owner?
---
TY for this.
---
First I've heard of this.... you sure someone isn't just spreading their typical negative propaganda against the game. Don't believe everything you hear.
---
And also explosive has demolition expert 60%
---
Yeah, I don't get why it's a big deal.  There are several games I play that have some sort of "tax" in player stores.  10% is on the cheaper side.  In the US there's a sales tax on items generally.  It's kinda like that.
---
I return from my challenge! Mostly successful. I've added [S'Mores](https://i.imgur.com/PPuSi5e.jpg) to the main post. However concrete is missing since I can't do all junk yet. (and water and logs are omitted because they'd ruin the map!)
---
Jesus Christ. I was worried this shit would go down.
---
By the fire station in Charleston ...past the station up a hill..like 4-5 of them
---
Wherever you heard this, dont use them for gaming news anymore lol
---
Isnt that what happens every time something good happens?
---
This is a great action, fix the duping before a weekend, can u imagine if they leave it till next week?
---
The cat and death law topiary.
---
As I mentioned; junk gets more complicated because I need the program to look for *everything* containing junk. So it's a solid maybe if i'll ever get it to do that I'm afraid.
---
As far as just advice - the highschools in MorganTown and Watoga are probably the best for plastic.
---
Can’t make good points or handle criticism
---
I feel like its gonna be pretty easy for beth to find and ban the dupers. They only have like 2 or 3 days worth of data to go through. Not at all like the 2 or 3 months they had to process the first time.
---
The tree one lol!
---
I'm desperate for those Neon Letters set :(
---
I'm still seeking reparations.
---
Yea they all know that two shot explosive weapon they got in December is duped but don't care, also sorry about the hit you got in karma.
---
Until they're done. Supposedly this is a hot fix so it shouldn't take terribly long.
---
PS4: AmateurRadioMan2
---
Shop Location: Flatwoods
---
Yeah, I bought my TSE Handmade from someone I suspected to be involved with duping. I didn't seek them out, it was a chance encounter. When he offered me my dream gun for a meagre 10% of my total caps, though... I don't regret it. That was over 300 hours of playtime ago. At 700 in now and I still haven't found a legit drop that compares. 
---
I don't like the legendary system, dealt with it in Fallout 4 because I wanted the trophies. Much regret there, it wasn't worth it... I'd rather not receive legendaries if they're going to be have horrendous weapon/ prefix combinationsand unworthy of the name. Would make actual drops more rewarding.
---
How functional is it?
---
I'm afraid I don't know how to do that - but I'm seeing lots of requests for spawns so I may give it some time.
---
Dang! I'm definitely going to be getting back into this tonight! Those houses are awesome.
---
No, its Bethesda fault. if you build your prison without gates, you don't blame inmates for escaping.
---
for the effort involved that is hardly a worthwhile reward, the first couple times I did that run I had to jump servers to get bugs because other players had just cleared the area out.
---
I lost a badass right armor piece because of this garbage.
---
It's not a bug. It's a feature. Next time do not tap the button that quickly.
---
One mine to rule them all. Seriously the only mine that matters.
---
Some people have reportedly been playing the game close to the hard carry limit of... what... 1500lbs? Fucking crazy; I couldn't live without fast travel. But apparently it's a thing.
---
Love The Mire. You aren't kidding about the random spawns. I do most of my legendary hunting just wandering around.
---
Toxic Valley is my second favorite. Those night time views.... 
---
My favorite workshop, the Red Rocket, is not in either of those regions. That's really the only con I can think of.
---
I reckon it'd work with a Gary.
---
Oh shit. Wow so potentially you could just pass it around and everyone will learn it? Or even just craft it as long as it’s in your inventory?
---
Awesome insight.
---
turn in your technical data (1 or 2 at a time only it doesnt stack) to camp venture and get random BoS apparel ( bomber jacket, lab coat ,fatigues
---
I shot to almost death with rifle and bashed the final hits because syringes weren't doing any dmg.
---
If high Dps have aggrieved and are standing near/on  building , barricades  or the tree line she will not land and subsequently can cause a loss where it could have been avoided
---
It usually lasts until it's over.
---
I lost 100 just from scrapping legendary gear I was storing in the past couple days.
---
Bivouac next to west tek.
---
Right? I’m glad they picked up so fast and I hope those asshats get banned. Just like I tell my kids, just because you possibly could get away with it, doesn’t mean you should do it anyways. People lack integrity and it ruins things for everyone.
---
I left out a detail or two in case it wasn't patched... But that's the jist
---
Ah ok thanks didn't know that just see people selling them a lot for like 10k caps lol
---
I thought this was satirical at first. But no, you keep defending your position. Wow
---
Why dont they just rebuff two shot shotguns to 4 shot shotguns while they're at it, makes as much sense as what you're saying
---
Needs more "spoiled vegetables."
---
Exactly that, yes. Odd that it doesn't show up for you
---
Yes a limited one with a stash box and bed on one.  The other is s full camp across the map. When I swap to the alt with no real camp it is located in the same place as my other.
---
Where recovered = stole.
---
Craft some shitty weapon and play Rambo on the event to mitigate weapon loss on the food processor.
---
I'm so disappointed when I can't explore someone's camp.
---
Make sure you hit the secret passages too. Loaded with them. My highest yield was 417. 
---
Use super duper when smelting you'll get even more
---
Oh no doubt. It’s a pain. I like to make it active and roam to do other things. They don’t have to be bugs in the highlighted area so I stumble across them. I gotta have ALL the mounts lol
---
Sad and true, it's damage isn't anything great either. Its prety much outclassed in every way by the Plasma Flamer and there are better heavy guns to choose from. It really needs a buff to be viable which is a shame because who doesn't want to run around with a Flamethrower, i sure as hell do.
---
But we all knew this would happen with vending, and probably again when we can place items in our camps
---
Just wait until you are trying to the possum badges and one of the 8 challenges for the electrical badge is to be a conduit at encrypted 60 times. I don't care if you grind that event all day for a month. You will not get to be a conduit 60 times.
---
I was really confused why I was seeing so many being sold, but yeah, now it all makes sense.
---
16x the detail tho ;)
---
You haven't criticzed anything. You made an empty useless statement and I responded in kind. The mode I envisioned allows for console to up players per server by double or triple, balances every broken aspect that survival struggles with right now, and adds incentive outside of mindless griefing to play the mode in the first place. Do you have any intelligent reputations to my claims?  If so, please share
---
Damn it. How did that happen?
---
I was at someone's vending machine when another player went on mic and asked if I wanted to help him do it, and I just gave a thumbs up while I grabbed my mic to plug in. I had to do it too so I was all for it. We got it done in like 5 mins, wouldve been quicker if we didnt accidentally fully kill ourselves (no revive available deaths) the first couple tries lol.
---
Yeah the new update brought back 2 glitches used to dupe
---
They're going to have to eventually if they want people to keep buying those camp items in the atomic shop.
---
Remember that the crossbow doesn't have to be fully broken to repair it.
---
I gotta check my box. I noticed a weird bug yesterday that froze my vending machine and wouldn't let me take the item out (lousy holotape) but when I went to my box it shown like 20x the amount that should be in it. I dont think it saved but if it did I'll send Bethesda a ticket and let them know what happened.
---
Caps are not real currency and the tax isn't going to anything in particular. All it does is inflate the cost of things.
---
If they did a community event or a lottery where players could win some of the caps collected through the tax I wouldn't have a problem but the current implementation is just unnecessarily dumb.
---
This happened to me on PC without switching to any alts (I dont have any). Just after reporting I noticed my vending machines were empty and had to re price everything...
---
I'm pretty happy with them addressing it this quickly. Hot fixing is super important
---
Is this the brick biv keeps talking about?
---
The bleedout makes it bearable. 30 damage over time, plus the 5 or 6 damage impact of the needle. The DoT does stack as well. Radscorpion venom does 40 instead of 30, but good luck gathering 10 stingers without scrapping them on accident
---
I logged back in today and both my vending machines were empty. That's kit change going character, just log out then back in. I ran a test on a single for sale item and server hopped, it was still there when I arrived back. So I am not sure what causes it, fairly sure its not just swapping characters though.
---
Yeah I saw that you could get those from the atom shop for "free". I saw some of them last night at the camps I went to, they look cool! But I'm pretty sure Beth wants us to pay for those..
---
24000 stimpaks for sale lol
---
i need help to if anyone can. my psn is sybiriya . ill be playing as soon as server is up
---
Get a grip. Why are people so fragile? It's obviously based on the Scottish flag.
---
Haha I didn’t even notice it is cake day!
---
More people visit CAMPS now, so more chances for things to spawn.
---
Your suggestions are complete and utter trash and they speak for themself anyone with half a brain on game balance can see got Doodoo they are
---
Ahh Gary!
---
I would kill a few low level Super Mutants with a pipe rifle from distance and then pick up a dropped sledge or super sledge until it broke.   I focused on strength to begin with to carry more.  It wasn’t long before the sledge did more damage than my guns.  The plus side is that if I was low on ammo I could use a sledge or a sword. 
---
My first permanent camp was just down the hill from Huntersville on the pond near the broken highway bridge.  
---
I got a lot of XP from Huntersville as I would hit it before heading out and then when I got back.   It’s also a quiet area so less need for turrets.
---
So you just relogged?
---
Logged off one night woke up the next morning armless. Drugs or alcohol were not involved😂
---
preach it!! be a warrior for justice!!
---
He's scared of being called waysiss
---
Shoot, me too
---
Not sure, but you can atleast borrow it from what i have read, now i need someone with it to make test
---
[That's... not where the term comes from.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_scrip)
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Well, they also give you a warning that dropping the item will destroy it and ask for confirmation...
---
They could always try progression instancing like WoW. I mean, considering Bethesda's brand of glitchiness it'd be hilarious, but they could try.
---
Meanwhile F76 players in reddit praising how Bethesda has put lot of effort into patch 9 - Yet here we pointing fingers at dupers, while Bethesda releasing content that they put lot of effort into and is getting praised for it. How can someone be so stupid and praise a content that hasn't gone through basic testing?
---
Gary?
---
Yeah lol had that happen in real life
---
Well damn, let's really hope it won't take so long! Thank you for the answer
---
I took the bleed out mod off, I had it installed but the chemist challenge wasn't updating, I figured it might be the mod. Turned out it wasn't but I already bashed the bear so no biggie. Chemist challenge just doesn't work for me.
---
I have .308 ammo for 2 caps each. Is that too much?
---
Yes. But you can put the BOS mod on yourself for less than someone would upcharge you for. There are 3 BOS plans and they each cost 90 caps or so at the grafton train station.
---
It seems to be different for the camp owner and anyone that travels to the camp.  I keep messing with mine trying to figure out the best place to put it.  I had people getting stuck in my foundation yesterday so I moved it and it seems to be working ok now.
---
Are we sure this is it? I could've sworn I saw all the backpack plans for sale in the vending machine where you start.
---
Forgive me if I missed it but how about safes? Prewar money is always in them and it breaks down to cloth. Need lots of cloth for gunpowder.
---
Would you mind posting your results back here? I’m very curious myself.
---
Yep. I did the same thing. Got my 50 kills, then realized I forgot to repair. Fired about 6 bolts into the ground, repaired, 6 more bolts, repaired. Easy.
---
Gorrgggharggorfggghh graoirghgg
---
Nah, if they put themselves on the map AND leave doors unlocked then it's basically an invitation to come in and take a look. Just remember to close the door behind you when you leave!
---
It's Bethesda, they take hours for the smallest of fixes.
---
PC Steffydoll
---
Selling mostly plans and ammo for cheap.
---
Remember when we could only play during certain times of the day on certain days? Good ole B.E.T.A. days.
---
I had a good, post-nuke whitespring run that yielded several very heavy 1-2 star weapons, but I'd already cleared the legendary machine for the day.  I just couldn't hold on to a medic's fat man and an executioners/bashing gatling gun after refilling my stash with other lightweight 1-2 star crap.  I sold them to the station vendor.
---
I did sell a bloodied combat shotgun about 5 minutes after I put it in my vending machine.  Very quick 450 caps after tax.
---
Also one of the best Fallout sites in history. &lt;3
---
Thanks for the reply :)
---
I’m in the Savage Divide, tucked into a lip on the cliff with picnic benches and regular animal spawns just west of The Top Of The World, so I don’t get attacked too much by anything really dangerous and if I do, it’s low level morerats and scorched
---
Nah just making a joke.
---
I don't understand, you put your weapon in the food processor?  Whats the bug here?
---
Shovel.
---
thats all.
---
Just listen to the atom shop theme. It's like an elevator song. It's going to be a while. XD
---
Why cant they just dupe the old man winter mask already? 😂😂
---
&gt;but 100% have a valid reason to NOT get on mic
---
I have some friends who try to avoid voice mic whenever they play games. Why? They're girls. The moment they speak there's sometimes somebody being ultra condescending to them just because of it. And reporting people in game doesn't seem to do anything, sadly.
---
Lol how did this get downvoted 10 times!?

There’s perks to make ammo weigh less. I have made 5k rounds of 5.56 in a day so that’s nothing for 2mm. Ammosmith, super duper, plus luck bobbleheads to get luck to 15 you have plenty of ammo easy. Everyday I get 1700 scrap pieces of lead from the lucky hole mine, that much of steel from killing super mutants and scorched and scrapping their weapons with scrapper perk
---
Why don't they shit on every mmo since 2001 for doing the same thing? Why did they wait 18 years to get mad about this?
---
Then sounds like you'll still enjoy it. Welcome back!!
---
Buyers beware.
---
Do grapementats not have any world spawns?
---
They should come in wooden crates

The only time I’ve heard bricking come up was someone discouraging people from using the camera launch glitch. They kept commenting on posts saying it would brick people’s systems with zero proof. He means crash to desktop basically. The game sometimes couldn’t load things in quick enough and go into a loading screen and/or crash, but it never bricked anyone’s console afaik. And I’ve done that glitch countless times (for science!)
---
It was my mistake. Thought I was dropping the backpack.
---
There are games you can play in-game?
---
Best review ever
---
I hate the sound of my own voice, too, but I also game with Australians. I tend to be up at 2-5am playing with them. Even if I could use mic in-game I tend to have to talk quiet so as to not wake other people in the house.
---
[Got you covered](https://i.imgur.com/n6nEnG2.jpg)
---
I've updated the post also.
---
Everytime I've gone to the Dolly Sods camp where the new daily is, I've gotten a magazine in one of the racks. I found 2 this morning. I also find one frequently beside the vendor at Camden Park. I sell them in my vending machine for cheap, I'm sorry it doesn't count!
---
Need a platform and a game name dude 😉
---
Me too! Glad I can participate in gaining more atoms again!
---
Change your doors to a powered door with the code thingie, the door closes automatically behind you. put the code above the door if you have the small letter set. all you need to make the door work both ways is a small generator and a pressure plate.
---
Atm im just naming them by the legendary effects you cant see
---
You would think a line of code that just triggers something whenever someone ends up with identical high value / rare items would be the answer, ie promoting further investigation
---
Hahaha nice one
---
Yes, wtf happens to all that plastic when I accidentally scrap my bulk lol
---
I’m assuming you found the lost arm. Cuz if not you can type faster than I can with two arms 😛
---
I tried to put up a drink roulette using the punch bowl until Bethesda shut it down. Though that was more like russian roulette than casino roulette ;) (basically you had a chance of drinking a Nuka shine rather than a more mundane alcohol).
---
No. The only way that someone can actually steal your power armor is if you drop the frame instead of placing it down. Dropping in enables anyone to interact, while placing it only allows the owner to interact.
---
Of course it's random. If they let people choose you'd see everyone running around with AAE handmades and bloodied death claw gauntlets after a couple days.
---
It doesn't work for me either. I can hear other people, but it's like their volume is permanently set to 10%. It doesn't matter what I set the voice slider to, it never helps.
---
Bricky!
---
If you have a carry weight perk for stuff you can go over the limit by dumping it all in and switching cards, the consequence being you cant put stuff in anymore until its cleared out
---
I could see it.  I earn 1-2k caps a night more or less by accident.  Typically do a West Tek run for legendaries and sell off all the guns and crap that drops after fat walking to Whitesprings to clear out the vendor.  Add in the caps they drop and it accumulates fast. 
---
Can see it getting ridiculously easy with vendoring if you're aggressive about it.  Plenty of flipping opportunities from other player vendors or selling bulk you prospect.
---
Ah, yea dodgy works cuz in PA you dont rly need AP or vats in most cases
---
Award for Campfire event. Got it first try but others may not be so lucky. Love this update :)
---
[Fusion cores map](https://i.imgur.com/41AnQwB.jpg) :)
---
I should add this doesn't seem to have caught fusion *reactors* unfortunately
---
It’s magic!! The hangar with 3 super mutants. Haha
---
But if you think about it, all the tasks you're completing are post-war creatures. So maybe the quiz is too?
---
Can you imagine testing the effects of doing the absolute most ass backwards things to dupe? Yeah neither did bethesda. You cant test everything. And when you have hundreds if not thousands of idiots who purposely try to harm a company, or accidentally harming by discovering this then purposefully introducing it to the masses - crap happens.
---
Could. Wouldn't.
---
I found one of the vendors in white spring had 24 technical data for sale at 2 caps each a week or so ago, i assumed that someone had sold them off to them etc.
---
In my inventory they were not marked as quest items so they did not stack as one item, so i transferred them to my stash and took one out, If i drop it and pick it up it will sometimes reactivate the Forbidden Knowledge quest, other times it will not. I have had to drop one data and repick it up several times for it to work. So i would suggest trying to drop it and pick it up multiple times.
---
As a side note if i have a non-quest marked technical data in my inventory and pick up another one from a container and it activates the quest line then the one i had then stacks with the new data to make one data but i get credited for both with the extra caps when i turn it in.
---
Yeah this is one of those things where you either need to:  
---
\-Ask on mic in-game
---
\-Ask and arrange online if you don't want to mic
---
\-OR be patient, eventually you will complete this
---
I don't like going on mic, but me and this dude in a skeleton onesie spent a good amount of time last night trying to kill ourselves and it was honestly a lot of fun. If you want to play this game full-solo you're just going to have to be patient and wait for the opportunity to arise....actually....can you kill someone in PVP and revive them? I haven't played survival, but if you're looking to make your own opportunity...
---
Sweet, thanks a ton. I may note the indoor locations for them on here as well, if I do I'll let you know. :D
---
I agree with most of it but why do you feel so entitled to having random people save your camp? They are only there to shop and it's not their place so why waste time or bullets? It isn't all about you buddy. It's not like I get all butthurt when I come back and my crops are all destroyed. But locked places and places with those stupid boards everywhere will always get a pile of fertilizer on their bed or machines.
---
Was the maintenance scheduled?
---
Wait i though you were talking about armor. You actually didn't have any arms?
---
I just built 3 crossbows, used each a handful of times and then repaired each once, presto!
---
Realistically, closer to only 95%
---
Your comment is like the head coach of the Ottawa Senators head coach saying “we’re a team” when asked what is going good for the team at the moment.
---
Not impossible. But worst case Ontario I get one three star ranged weapon, one three star melee weapon, one two star ranged, one two star melee, one three star armor piece, and one three star Murghrgh's choice.
---
I think it'll be fine.
---
Time for a Boston Tea Party.
---
In the end, it doesn't matter. It's down, and when it Comes back up
---
We wont know the reasons.
---
They said they’re «working on bringing the game back online» now, so shouldn’t be that long until it’s up again.
---
You could instead allow people to add wanted notes at the train stations
---
No clue. My carry and stash are both pretty close to maxed and I have nowhere close to this much stuff.
---
If you search “robco” on here youll see lots of explanations
---
I mean the game keeps to the fact that there are supposed to be only 24 people alive.
---
the lure is that they come over, lose their rads, then cant buy anything (cause who would spend 25k caps purified water?)
---
I must admit I'm a little bummed out regarding the actual machine. Not sure what I was expecting, but I can't provide the power required. I've tried, but the Super Mutants up the hill from me go ape if I go electric. They've got me lightning my shack with whale oil or something antiquated. I love my spot though, I'm willing to remain a hoarder if moving home is required to sell all my drugs, though.
---
They're all marked with small yellow triangle flags on poles. 
---
You press a button at the starting line, wait for the voice over to say go (actually a few seconds after), timer will start in quest log and a quest way point will appear at the next checkpoint (which are also marked by flags).
---
As you go through each checkpoint you'll hear a ding noise, and the marker for the next checkpoint will appear.
---
Didn't mean it was a literal sales tax.  It's just an analogy.

Whiskey is +2 str, if you have double alcohol perk that makes +4 to 5.  Or you can Buffout, thats another +2.

There is a laser skin yes you have to have the tricentennial paints.
---
What did he do?
---
Yeah, try the brick building set. The I use those walls on the second floor of my house, it looks great
---
Well, I've gone from maintenance to entitlement messages so that's usually a sign of progress.
---
Good job. However I feel like the markers on the map could be easier to read. Maybe a brighter colour.
---
Since  last patch shop menu are super slow, sound also bugged in shop.  Seems an issue on server side they try since yesterday to fix...  
---
 Just quite a bit grumpy as i just took a workshop 5 minutes before the shutdown timer start... Timer which started at 7 Minutes.. before the timer always started at 20 minutes...
---
Those r walls though...😉
---
I... I will upvote you, friend.
---
I'm on PC, but yeah it seems everyone sells them cause they kinda suck, except for if you want to farm for high level recipes. At least that's what I have heard.
---
I wish the crossbow was better, it was fun to use for a little while
---
That was beautiful.
---
Same, too bad they fixed it before it got added to the list of war crimes
---
Oh, in that case you're 100% right lol
---
The servers will be back up on Monday. Have a nice weekend.
---
An exploit is a bug that a player actively, consciously utilises to their benefit. So, you're not wrong in saying an exploit is a bug, but the key difference between a bug that offers a benefit to the player and exploit is that the latter involves awareness and intent.
---
For example, if a bug were to occur that results in me accidentally getting the best gun in the game, without me having put in any effort and without knowledge that such a thing was even possible, that's not an exploit. That's just a bug that happened to be beneficial to me. 
---
However, if I were to find out that this bug can be actively triggered, resulting in me receiving more amazing guns, and I then consciously choose to repeat the bug over and over... that's an exploit.
---
The spots for tameable animals I see used the most are right behind South Mountain Lookout, the one by the sunflower north of Abbies Bunker, and on the road south of Abbies. Between Camp Venture and Harpers Ferry is a reliable location as well, and the spot east of Cranberry Glade(by the bat)
---
Report him
---
I mean, you can’t drop items that have paint if they’re from the atomic shop. That’s why you can’t drop clothing items that you can unlock the recipe for in the atomic shop.
---
You could just block/ignore the person and hop servers. Pretty easy.
---
dae fartnite bad?
---
Any holes yet?
---
Soo, everybody got a backpack?
---
Don't have those
---
They just said they’re working on bringing it back online, so shouldn’t be that long
---
Lmaoooo, cant believe posts like this are still a thing
---
Yeah, I can; it's called "quality assurance testing," and it used to be a pretty big part of software development. But when Bethesda updates the game to have camera dailies/weeklies weeks before the camera is even introduced, it seems pretty clear that's a phrase they, too, have never heard.
---
Thank you, I didn’t bother to try it because someone told me it wouldn’t work but I’m gonna give it a shot.
---
He kept shooting me and hitting me with an axe at my camp. He even waited around till I respawned so he could keep doing it. I got him a few times but fml...
---
I saw that and a deathclaw one, where are those found?
---
I have my base set up in the forest right across the street from the Overseer's camp. I mainly do it for easy access to all the crafting stations and free food and purified water for lower level players.
---
Pros 
---
Easy access mentioned above for low level players.
---
Materials to make healing salves and disease cures are all near the camp.
---
Plenty of wood for all of the food items and boiled water I make.
---
Not far from Vault 76, so I can quickly kill ticks for their blood to make blood packs for my Stimpaks.
---
Cons
---
Not many challenges or challenging enemies in the area.
---
Thanks, I have all types and lvl 20, 30, 50, and 50. Thanks.
---
I will admit, I was okay with it at the time, but now I can't even imagine it being applied again.
---
Ok thank you man, that’s actually helpful
---
You'd think Todd would have called them first to check.
---
Odd, I never even received the misc quest on the one character.
---
Myself and 2 other buddies from my group have had things ranging from PA (whole suits) to singular armor pieces go missing after crashes/ going to bed and waking up in the morning.....//////PS4///// :;..;:
---
At least its friday and not middle of Saturday or Sunday
---
Record it or it never happened they will ask prof
---
it doesn't. and in games where you can be PM'd it's even worse.
---
PC: Sabbeyj ...tons of radaway, super stimpaks, screws, springs, fluxes, and key cards!
---
Turn the graphics down a nudge and it should be fine. What GPU you got/planning to get?
---
Dang, they didn’t? Todd actually called me an hour ago himself to apologize for the inconvenience
---
Not yet. I’m debating as to which mod I want. As it is, I can carry between 385-410. That’s more than enough for me. I’d love to find out the exact specs and stuff for all of the mods before buying them.
---
I want to know how many credits u get for each possum challenge.
---
Good job ace, you got bullied by a kid. Ignoring them is more effective.
---
You go to the Robco sign in front of the building by the truck...theres a lit up "scouts" emblem there, and u push a button on a speaker
---
I'm amazed that you cannot fathom that all game engines have unit tests.
---
That unit tests, are impossible to write for and will not detect emergent behavior that occurs between multiple systems at run time.
---
Unit tests are great at things such as assure vendor inventory is decremented on transaction.
---
They are not great for orchestrational tasks that serve as the middle ware for multiple systems each with it's own state.
---
Sure you can write a unit test for those but it requires such a mountain of mocks to even attempt to write something. But these aren't unit tests are they? No they are integration tests.
---
Unit tests are great for engine level things like physics, however, the vast majority  of the game is not written in the engine. It's in scripts and callouts, in multiple languages, that are called async in reaction to player or network actions.
---
That shit is tough to unit test.
---
You can unit test the frameworks used to host that stuff, but not the stuff itself.
---
Pretty sure the 60 is just a length of time, assuming seconds maybe, since I have completed it on two characters now.
---
Also untrue there muppet.  Check ya sources.
---
I was making grenades in my camp today, and heard a woman's voice say "oh wow!" over area chat.  I quit out of the tinker's bench, opened my front door and there's a person at my vending machine buying up some extra flux I was selling at base cost (100 caps I think?).  I gave her a wave and she asked if I had any other varieties, as she was looking to build her first rad shower.  She only needed like 1 more fluorescent or yellowcake flux, I forget which, so I just dug it out of my stash and gave it to her as a buy-some-get-one-free deal.  
---
That made my day probably as much as it made hers.  I love it when people buy my stuff, or just being able to give them things they value much more than I do.  
---
I sell everything at very reasonable prices, so as not to exclude players that don't have a lot of time or resources to gather mountains of caps and kit themselves out fully with three star everything, and I really hope my gear improves their playing experience.  A single star instigating rifle makes a *tremendous* difference for a sniper.  I've sold 3 so far (fully modded with hardened receivers, stabilized pieces, suppressor and a medium scope so its ready to use sraight away) at 499 caps each, and I feel very happy knowing that three more players are now able to kill just about anything with a single head shot.
---
Yup, kids to bed, baby settled, wife placated, kids back to bed, get to the pc, &lt;clicky&gt;, fucking maintenance!!
---
i mean, that isn't too bad.
---
it seems nobody wants to be a conduit anyway.
---
id prefer that over needing to kill 50 things with a fucking crossbow.
---
I feel like everyone should experience that quest on their own anyway. Builds character.
---
5 points of intelligence to raise your 20% damage boost up to 32%
---
I spawned inside someone's locked house. It was my first wanted..Now I fast travel to the nearest location and run to their camp. Only thing with travel mats is some people will purposely place the mat in a spot that isn't too nice to spawn in to. If they made a vending machine the spawn point that might make it harder to fall into a trap, since the vending machine is what makes the camp seeable once it's powered.
---
So you're saying I should buy it then?
---
I'm kidding.  If you (you being those that ask if they should buy this game) want to decide to buy a game that's been out for a while, look it up on YouTube or Twitch and watch some gameplay.  I bought Fallout 76 because I did just that.  I was on the fence about it, but seeing live play changed my mind.
---
SaltClaw - if it’s not deep pocketed already I can make or add that if needed. 
---
I should have everything ready Saturday or Sunday.
---
I am aware of this, but when I created my crossbow it had over 100% durability.  Even approaching 30 kills it still had over 100% until I started bashing.
---
never happened.
---
Yeah I’ve been turning in TD for about 3 weeks (2 or 3 three times a day) and still only get water and junk.  Lol you got any?
---
Just saying is I get a TSA anything and he tells me it’s duped I’ll (keep it forever) quickly (put it up for sale) destroy it
---
I guess it wasn't a brick per say but hard drive corruption
---
I’ve already got a GTX 1070, I know it’s a bit of a bottleneck right now, but once I start my summer job I plan on buying a Ryzen 5 2600. Should hopefully never have problems with games after that.
---
My house is literally a 5x5 metal box with little in the way of decoration and I don't have the creativity to make it into anything fancy or nice looking. :(
---
Set your Xbox profile to offline and then change world's, he won't be able to join you
---
They're gunna do what now?
---
Why does this subreddit attract all the rejected shitposters? This is very low quality bait, you should be ashamed.
---
Thank you for giving me info and not being a pretentious cunt. Cheers!
---
I'd 100% buy it on sale but every time I seem to look there isnt one
---
Yes, imo. Finish what you're doing and switch worlds.
---
Would only be a problem if you're doing a quest that isn't checkpointed or will take longer than 20 min for you to complete. I've had server failures/disconnects/blue screens during those. You just suck it up and move on. They cannot accommodate everyone. 20 min should be more than enough time for you to wrap things up and jump to a new world.
---
I'd settle for their code base doing checks before actions. Verify the item is there before moving/deleting. Something long the lines of flag item for delete, transfer item, verify item successfully transferred, send delete message, verify delete, delete. At any point if a verify fails, it reverts. its alot of handshaking and overhead but wouldn't this prevent a lot of their duplication errors?
---
What's wrong with that? The PVP is gone in adventure. I want to have fun, not grind all the time. All they do is make it more frustrating. Like the last patch, they nerfed the flaming chainsaw and raised the enemies damage output. I noticed it and my friends did too. I guess some people like difficult games. "The Outer Worlds" comes out this summer, after that F. Fallout76!
---
On Reddit they can.
---
When you use the "block for session" option, they can't follow you. I mean, they might have alts or something, but then that gets into creepy town.
---
The only things I have sold consistently is 5.56 ammo
---
I have all the plans set to cheap.  But they hardly sell.
---
I can tell you what is not moving
---
12 guage isnt moving at 2 caps each.
---
2mm at 2 caps
---
5mm at 1 cap (wish I could put a lower price!)
---
.45 at 1 cap
---
.308 at 1 cap
---
Cyro and fuel at any price
---
Slow to move stuff has been
---
Plans (I think everyone has the semi rare to common ones)
---
Recipes
---
Bulk mats 
---
Fusion cores (have sold 7 at 100 caps each)
---
Bobbleheads
---
Honestly.   I buy power armor plans from the vendors.  Just to get my caps below max.   Then run my shop until I get near max again.   Not sure what I am going to do when I have all the vendor plans.
---
Yeah, let's nerf two shot and explosive because they overshadowed every other build and +100% universal damage with no real disadvantage was way too much damage
---
Let's also buff up a tertiary effect to +100% damage!
---
Better today on a Friday than on Monday when the exploit they’re fixing has had all weekend to run and flood the world in duplicates. They didn’t say what the exploit was but if it is duping then I’d rather it was fixed sooner rather than later
---
is it OCed?  what gpu do you have tied to it? enough RAM?  i have a friend setup on an AMD FX8350 overclocked to like 4.2ghz, 16gb ram and an amd RX580.  he can run it 30-50 fps at lowest settings and seems smooth enough, but the CPU is definitely the bottleneck. 
---
 if you have a K variant CPU and don't have it overclocked, i think you may want to.
---
Pretty much every 3 star hunting rifle i saw was in this price range.  Its not like what specific 3 star combination I'm looking for won't eventually show up at someone's shop for that price range
---
Plus Im a patient shopper got no problem waiting for somone to value it less than i do so i can snatch it up
---
I actually wanted to get just a smidge of radiation to top up Adrenal when I discovered this, to my dismay. Nearly got murdered good by the mutants at the site north of Whitespring; point blank rocket shots to the face are not cool.
---
Slow clap...well played...well played indeed.
---
Cool. Interior maps are sorely needed. Think Fort Defiance.
---
The sign in front of the building has a automated tour button.
---
Yes, ideally that would fix the problem - but even if these objects had such an ID, when do you check it? When they are dropped? Traded? Purchased? Moved? Modded? Equipped? Used? Inspected?  I'm not familiar with all the dupping methods people have been using, but I bet there have been various different types of scenarios.
---
I suspect they haven't done this for performance reasons. Maintaining and checking an attribute like this for every weapon/armor object in the world would be quite resource intensive, even for only one of the above mentioned scenarios.
---
No, I don't want to have to figure out what that bright ball in the sky is.
---
Straight up block him on xbox, not in game for session, on xbox block. He won't be able to chase you server to server anymore. Only way he would ever run into you again is if y'all end up on the same server. Also, if you don't want to deal with fighting some stupid person, just ignore them. They can't kill you unless you start fighting back. Ignore and block from now on
---
So a 3\* Legendary Weapon roll really only costs a net of 60. If you don't like the roll you can immediately sell it back for 40. I like this.
---
I called a new dupe yesterday thsts all I must say
---
Just give them heart emotes and don't react. Between the camp invulnerability update and passive mode, he's just wasting ammo.
---
It's entirely unreasonable to expect a dev team to test so thoroughly that none of their many thousands of players could conceivably find an exploit in a game as large as 76.
---
any evidence?  I tried to buy a few "bricked" ps4's.  People never responded to what was essentially an offer to buy their brick.
---
that was a kotaku circle jerk that linked a reddit post as source, which linked another games article, which eventually updated to include the kotaku article.  
---
It was a fucking mess.
---
Outside is down for maintenance too.
---
Are the servers down rn?
---
Nothing is sure unless confirmed by the devs. Just speculation at this point. The thing is, after you unlock the mod, you learn to mod your backpack and you get a free (Known) Plan for that mod. Meaning i can grind for 8 badges, learn to mod and then sell the plan to someone else.
---
I couldn't find 'em in the store, but they were available in my CAMP building thing to build, so I did.
---
I have 1 deathclaw and a handful of cats just bushin' around.
---
Ok if I see him on my list again I will do that. Thank you
---
I had the same thing once, but just one sword. Nothing in any of the other containers.
---
Had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
What about something like mapping it to the coordinates of the door that opens to the interior space. 
---
Find what interiors have benches, add markers to the coordinates of their entrances.
---
Yeah me too. I said ‘it’s cool bro, you do you and I’ll do me, chill’. He said ‘peace out’
---
Fallout 76 problems seem to be circling around. Looking from the outside, Bethesda seem to fix the problems, but in reality they have not progressed with the core problems since BETA. Game is still laggy, full of glitches, duping comes back time to time, servers are constantly crashing, enemies are stucking to objects, enemies are just standing still and doing nothing, picking up loot from enemies fails very often etc. There is no chance that you can play FO76 like a 3-4 hours per session without server starting to lag and crash.
---
Solid GPU. My rig is an i7 3770 and a gtx 970 and 8gb system ram, game is installed on my SSD. Game runs fine for me and my 1080p monitor. Haven't done an FPS check though. Never noticed any major frame drops apart from at server end.
---
Could the mods please sticky this?
---
Upvote a million if I could!
---
Well if your patient some melee guy would eventually sell it like trash 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Well to be fair if I booted this game up after deleting it, and saw god only know how many hours and gigabytes for the update, I may ask first too.
---
Write-up is excellent btw!
---
Reminds me of ARK, I love this!
---
Nope. I feel the same way. I have a simple 2-story house with long balcony that extends past the edge of a cliff. I love having people see it. What's best is that when someone nukes Prime, you get a perfectly unobstructed view from the balcony.
---
Ty!
---
It’s no excuse to not fix those , as a high rate of players solemnly collect freebies
---
Either way something happened, and op is wrong
---
The crossbow one can be easily completed simply by going to a low level area, you one shot everything. There's plenty of places with lots of low-level mobs in high densities, such as Flatwoods. I personally travel to Vault 76, kill all the Liberators off to the right hand side (also a great spot for robot-killing challenges), then make my way down to Flatwoods. Lots of Scorched and various animals on the way, and plenty more robots in/around the Agricultural Centre.
---
Yes. They are holotapes, but are usually found looking like magazines. The very first one is in the terminal in your bedroom in the vault.
---
Harsh words from an entitled cunt.
---
My thoughts exactly what a load of BS that was
---
This isn't bait. I'm ranting about an idiot who i came across today.
---
Used to get plans that were otherwise difficult to get.  A lot of those have been pushed out to vendors at this point though.
---
Dang I fell for it I too came to inform you of maintenance.. I too will give a slow clap... well played :/ grr
---
Finally we can catch up on family and...Pfffbwhaha sorry i couldn't pull it off.
---
I like your input a lot actually. I'd like to see it to at least be an enclosed thing to up player count let server. Maybe even it be its own server on its own that you can join by fast traveling to its location. I do like the idea of being able to have a huge open space for the actual fighting though.
---
My problem is that I still do from my shotgun days even though I'm melee now. I'm sitting on 30,000 shells because I can't not collect the plastic I see everywhere.
---
..i switched from a pistol gunslinger to a melee build and i still unequip my fucking fire axe to not lose ammo if i log back in.
---
I mean...you *can* block him. If you're not going to, that's on you.

&gt; Since the Sealing, we, as a people, have changed. Few can bear to be on the surface because they are not used to having a black sea of nothingness above them. The sensation of falling upward is so great for them that they lie frozen, clutching the ground. But that is not the main reason. All of us cannot stand the bright light of that which you call the sun; living underground for so long has made our eyes too sensitive to light. We cannot travel far from the safety of our homes beneath the ground.

Death is a preferable alternative

I love the name of your shop.
---
Carefully, he's a hero.

Normal 2500, it does boost clock from 3.3ghz to around 3.5-3.6ghz though. GPU is GTX 1070 which is a small bottleneck as far as I know, I plan on buying a Ryzen 5 2500 sometime during this summer though.
---
I'm not person like you... well.. I just want to say need balance. I have TSE and its dmg is 1000 I feel this just enough.
---
Wasnt there an update yesterday?
---
The normal terminal under power connectors allows u to play games.
---
He can't hurt you or your camp on adventure mode so, extremely obvious bait tbh. Keep going though you must have a very satisfying life for a 29/30 year old, you aren't pathetic at all.
---
The TSA is that two shot with arsehole effect?
---
Not to mention there is a challenge for killing scorch with a crossbow that rewards atoms.   Feed two birds with one scone.
---
I dont really get this, TSE are still overpowered even after the nerf. Personally, I think they shouldnt be able to have both effects on one weapon, but maybe its just me.
---
Pretty sure.
---
It's the Red Menace!
---
right in time for Mutant Hunter World: Iceborne
---
I have an i5-3330 (according to UserBenchmark, inferior to your 2500) and an OC'd GTX 1060 and I can run it fine on High with 40+ FPS. You go ahead and enjoy your Fallout 76 :)
---
Thanks for this, I picked up some great ideas. Putting the painting in front of the gas station sign and then letters on that is brilliant.
---
I'm a ho for elemental effects.
---
As it stands, burning and bleeding are absolute garbage, so a rework of those effects in general would be nice, even though they're just mods at the moment.
---
Lol Literally asked for info and toxicity comes. You would feel the same.

Just join an Encrypted event. Someone is very likely to go down in the water. If you're as lucky as a friend of mine, 2, and you can knock out 2 challenge parts in 30 seconds.
---
I would love to have a FNV style series of camp items.  I loved the feel of the casinos in FNV and the Sierra Madre from Dead Money was also really nice.  It would be awesome to have the holographic projectors from Dead Money as well.
---
The main problem I see with actually wagering caps would be that the camp owner would need to provide the caps to stock the slot machines or other devices.  Though with a poker table or any other group game the funds could come straight from the participants.
---
Sadly I doubt we will ever see it due to reasons already mentioned in this thread.
---
My god, didn't know it was THAT bad. But they can still play around with the ammo weight and the amount of materials required to craft them.
---
You should have let him live he has unique dialogue and talks about the "white thing"
---
[](/ftia)It's alright, unless you've got a ton of kits handy you'd have to repair it 6 times before you finish that 12 seconds of fire since the mods for the flamer seem to shrink the cnd bar way too much.
---
Ah. I'm PS4, but I've had decent luck server hopping at Whitesprings. Just keep hopping directly at the spot you spawn in. Usually takes me about 5-10 hops before I see Ansel on the hood of the red car immediately in front of me and to the right when I spawn in.
---
I guess snark was assumed when there wasn't any?
---
I’d love to work on some other flags! I already did one for the Responders and I’ll try to think outside the box for a Vault 76 one
---
i'd love a hot/cold system like in skyrim survival mode... would finaly give outfits/clothes a use outside of looking fashionable (and maybe even have it so we can toggle armor showing over our clothes?)
---
"it just works"
---
For none of woman born shall dupe
---
Yeah as I said me and my wife spent a large portion of April hopping around servers and places looking for the tourist. To no avail at all, very annoying as seems we have to have the camera really to progress the challenges for the Scout growth (which don't get me wrong, I love how they aren't just simple travel here, do a thing, congrats your next level)
---
Must be one hell of a dupe glitch
---
Thank you.  I didn't even notice until you said something.  lol
---
Sure, that's a thing (though not quite as helpful).
---
The issue is that the extracted data doesn't work that way.  What you'd have to do is somehow figure out which drops are in which instanced areas (possible, maybe easy, maybe not terribly easy).  Then figure out where the entrance is to each instance (probably can't be done automatically.  Would have to be done by hand).  Then map all 350 dots to that one entrance location (useless mostly, but could be done by hand).
---
Seems like a lot of work.  For an individual data point like benches (well, that's a few data points), it might be something that could be done given a fairly good amount of time.  It's just a major pain compared to automatically mapping the data in one pass (more or less).
---
I am surprised there isn’t more Raider fans upvoting this
---
"Is it time to wake the master?"  
---
"Soon brothers, E3 is coming"
---
No.   But I have run into a sheepsquatch the site west of Dyer Chemicals fighting Super Mutants.   There is usually some some high level enemies attacking each other in that area.   There isn’t much in the way of loot or junk, but it’s a decent place for a bit of XP.
---
I hope you reported them - there is no way those items don't go over their stash limit.
---
Yeah my own fault I know. Just was trying to get rid of the extra backpack and apparently dropped my armor instead.
---
You can't be serious my guy.
---
Tl;dr So, is that a yes or no? Oh nevermind, I'll aak on a new post.
---
They're just so horrible to do. We don't have maps of interiors. So what do we do? Vaguely overlay them outside? Then it looks like the stuff's outside. It's just ugly any which way I look at it.
---
One level 120ish showed up briefly, was killed and didn't return. 
---
I'm definitely not equipped to run it myself. I was holding my own against all the bots that showed up but once the pylon was dragging me down in addition to the hits I was taking it was all over. 
---
Ran in circles for quite a while hoping others would show up but no dice. Unlucky server draw!
---
Why sheep? Baa sheep
---
Haters: "Why do you love FO76 so much? It sucks!"
---
Me: "\*points to this thread\*"
---
You really don’t understand why people are responding to you the way they are? 
---
Take a moment to re-read your OP and self reflect.
---
I generally have the bigger gun and they rum off screaming, plus i also placed my camp near a deathclaw spawn and i take them unarmed all the time, that usually scares people off
---
Naaa..its a meh level event. My guess would be a dupe exploit or something having to do with the in game economy.
---
This is all stuff he is selling so he isn't carrying it, somehow his stash is holding all of this stuff. No way this is 800lbs.
---
It works like this: you intend to put an ingredient into the hopper but after selecting an ingredient (e.g. beef) another item from your inventory ends up being selected instead. The beef doesn't transfer to the hopper... but your best weapon did.
---
If you don't notice and take the item back, or cancel out of the screen, it's too late. The item's gone. Backing out of the screen to cancel the action eats whatever you put in there instead of returning the item to your inventory. It works similar to the legendary scrip machine. Your items are safe until you exit out of the screen. The moment you do it processes whatever items were selected in the window.
---
This one got me a few times during BETA. It routinely ate entire stacks of ammo.
---
I came across a Deathclaw Matriarch getting destroyed by a group of glowing ants.
---
I would love to see this
---
Well I guess I was on the wrong path with my thought process. I guess I've just been lucky. I hope they fix it and wish they could give all of you your stuff back. I know they can't but would be nice
---
I have no idea what exactly I'd have to add to the file.
---
Arrg just f’in’ stop the duping 4 real. I hope they start banning IPs or PSN logins or the equivalent for pc and Xbox users so these ahole f’ers can’t just make a new account and come back. No essays no second chances just see you later why not just play the game as intended. I was one crossbow fix away from getting my backpack!! Here is my up vote.
---
Yeah no. Machine maintenance includes the act of repair by definition. I'm not making it up.
---
I noticed a few times over the last few days where i would remove an item from sale and move it to my inventory but it would be still listed, once i exited and entered the vending machine again it was no longer listed. Theres definitely a few bugs in there
---
Just post here on Reddit when you are starting it up but allow like 10-15 mins for everyone to show up and help you. You get that quest done and some challenges for others.
---
No. I just couldn't resist and it's just not the same maintenance waiting without that coming up.
---
Those ants are no joke.
---
I think there's definitely legal boundaries around that, especially since this data pulled from the game could be technically argued to be Bethesda's IP (even though it's just coordinates)
---
Dupers really do suck. So please don't ask how to dupe and please don't accuse others of duping alike. Thanks, that's all.
---
Even without the atom paint the backpack gets destroyed when dropped
---
Whatevs. I don't require that-- more screen messages. Sure it's on the list of nice to have, but I put other QOL priorities that haven't been implemented ahead of that. The server maintenance rarely happens to me, so it's a nonissue for me. And 20 min is really enough for me to get it together to jet to another world. Plus they didn't even used to give a warning.
---
Hey it happens we are at the will of the game ha ha
---
I've never had a compliment on [my camp](https://imgur.com/hdi2WG1), but I get plenty of visitors that like to peruse my wares.  My vending machine is on the front porch where the rocking chair and table used to be, so it should be really easy to find.  I'm also across the tracks from the Whitespring Station, so anyone that sells their junk there can use my hotel and peek at the stuff I'm selling.  Location, location, location.
---
Porting into a random spot in someone's camp, I usually spend a minute or two trying to find their vending machines.  I attempted to make mine as obvious as possible.
---
It’s a “Confederacy” of groups. We were combined with the Free States and a BoS chapter as well as a Trading company. That is why we are named like that. I’m not from America, so I have no ties to the American Confederacy
---
Mutant's, that gives you +dr when mutated. If you have a heavy combat chest with mutant's and +str I'll give you 2K
---
I'm not feeling entitled to be defend, i'm just expecting them to clean up their mess. It's my home. Wouldn't you be annoyed if i come to your home, make a mess, break a window then just leave? 
---
My base is in whitesprings, near the river, close to those whitespring robots. Prior to vending machines those robots always did a great job grabbing the atttention of any random mobs; and there were even behemots there a couple of times.
---
Now it's a completely different story. And as i said in my initial post, i've even had people actively luring mobs to my camp. In my ~300 hours i spent playing, the one time i lost the fusion generator was due to a nuke. Heck i've even been on survival and nobody destroyed it. Now i had it destroyed twice in 3 days... 
---
I don't care about crops and other cheap stuff like that, but i do care about more expensive things. 
---
I will defend other peoples camps because that's the nice thing to do. I honestly believed that's not such an outrageous idea to expect others to do the same for mine. 
---
BTW this bit makes no sense:
---
&gt;They are only there to shop and it's not their place so why waste time or bullets? It isn't all about you buddy
---
"why would i help if it's not **my** base? i'm only here to shop, i don't care about anything else. &lt;-- That's what a selfish person acts like. They're all about "i'm the best fuck the rest".
---
Meanwhile i'm just trying to tell people to defend ALL camps they visit if mobs are spawned. How is that me being selfish? I'm not asking people to only defend my own camp...
---
Here's to hoping they built tools to track that stuff and ban the perpetrators for life
---
yeah the gpu is good.  you will have a better experience than what i described.  and the new ryzen should be out this summer so hold off until they release it.
---
Ah. I tend to get trigger happy sometimes. Next time, I'll walk with him and listen to his tail, then shank him.
---
I agree with the cheating statement in online games and in this context, but disagree with a blanket "all cheating ruins games" with that subtext that games are only enjoyable due to the challenge.
---
In Fo4, after I beat the game a couple times, I started screwing around with console commands. Let me tell you, Targeting Rocket Launcher Sawed-off Shotguns, MIRV Miniguns, and Assault Rifle Harpoon Guns are things of beauty.
---
lmao best comment of the day 😂
---
O rly? I need to invest in some then. Mobs tend to spawn on a bridge near my camp, which isn't all bad but the missile launcher my friend gave me tends to blow up my crops and other turrets.
---
Aw, I was going to make fun of you, but now I realise... you were making fun of me..
---
hopefully its an oversight... hopefully gets solved
---
Appreciate the feedback!
---
Before i bought a new PC i ran the game on i5-4400 &amp; GTX970. It ran pretty well but still stuttering. You might want to check the system requirements and some tests before buying, your CPU is pretty old.
---
Yes, I have perk cards/armor that make ammo lighter - but all of this stuff is in his or her stash. As far as I'm aware those perks only work while items are on the player, right? There's no way those items don't take them over their stash limit.
---
Nah, thats for all those new hip companies and their fancy splash screens. Bethesda does it the old say....a forum.
---
I buy oddball outfits I don't recognize.  Don't think I've found any "rare" drops but I didn't have a "Drifter" outfit or the Nuka jackets and wasn't going to pass them up for 50 caps. 
---
Stable flux under 50 caps if I'm short that type.  Most any flux 30 or under.
---
Bulk junk that I need if it's cheap (1/2 vendor price or so, about 50ish caps).  Acid and aluminum.  Ran out of screws for some reason so watching for those.  Saw a bunch for 3 caps each but didn't bite - might have been a good deal.
---
Any plan I don't have that's under 800 caps I pretty much insta-buy.  There's not many I need though.  Oddball weapon weapon mods.  PA stuff as it comes but I don't use it much and have a buddy that can do them all so I don't really care.
---
Oddball crafting stuff for challenges like Redcap or Tarberry.  Too bad they are so hard to keep fresh and in stock.
---
Treasure maps for 30 caps or less.
---
Trash legendaries for ~20 caps per scrip.  In other words, About 50-60 for one stars and a couple hundred for 3.
---
Nuka Cola and Cherries!  10 or less for Colas and 20 for Cherry.  Seen Quantums for 30 but haven't bit yet.
---
Going to be looking for stimpaks at under 20 tonight I think.  What I *really* need to do is go through my mules and character and do an inventory and purge.
---
Part of my buying habits work around wanting to stay at around 20k caps on my main.  Need some wiggle room for vendor sales so sometimes an interesting legendary gets sold to fart around with a build variant or just to hold onto for value.  I'm positive we're going to see "better" weapons released soonish (maybe with vaults) so don't want to sit on too much investment inventory.
---
yup, yup, yup.
---
it almost feels like  Bethesda is trying to force us all to live in the forest.
---
It's most likely because since patch 9 people on xbox have been duping items like crazy.
---
Personally, I'm glad they are fixing it so quickly.
---
You took the bait and died, if you stayed in passive and ignored it, he would have gone away.
---
Yeah, chose to join one of my friend's worlds to check the vending machines and I noticed my camp wasn't broadcasting. I went to check and yeah, vending machines were empty and all the stuff was in my stash.
---
My guess is that maybe you have to catch a frog to put in it first? if you look in the Tinkerers bench you can craft a frog jar for holding one in
---
I'm sure this quest has brought people together in some instances. I got lucky, a lower level guy stumbled into my camp and guestured me to follow. I cut a path to Vendor Bot Resin for him, his target evidently, and stumbled around in the menus trying to get my microphone working. There was a language barrier but I managed to explain that I needed him to kinda...die. I figured he was on the quest too, but in retrospect I doubt he was! He got the message though, through a grenade at a wall and gave me a jump start on the backpack. Much love, random guy! 
---
After that I chose Archer, Mammologist and Hunter as they didn't rely on cryptids/events/players. Got my backpack, the day one skin in the store (that I criticised in another thread)? I bought it, looks great!
---
If you know how to craft rare PA mods you can make a killing grabbing PA parts and modding them out. Free T60 leg abandoned on the side of the road + a handful of cheap mats = a quick 250 caps for leg with calibrated shocks. Any torso with a jetpack? 500 caps all day. 
---
People are buying the things faster than I can scavenge PA parts.
---
One you've accumulated 18k, go and buy one of the serums and start cranking those out. Pick something like carnivore (fluorescent flux) or Grounded (yellowcake), and you'll have no trouble gaming the materials. Sell them to vendor bots for 4-500, and once they're tapped out sell them to players for 2-300, and you'll make your money back in no time.
---
It does include those two junk types. Is it possible the tape you've found before is not a guaranteed spawn and just the product of an "any junk" type spawn? I would be very surprised if Mappalachia got every spot *except one*
---
The top 3 still tend to be those who kill players. Takes you X amount of time to gain XP and then it takes another player 30 seconds to take 75% of it and reset you to zero.
---
He only called you guys?
---
He brought my new canvas bag straight to my door.
---
Very much appreciated thank you for all your hard work
---
Yeah I just don’t get why they would shutdown the servers and try to find a fix while there shutdown. It seems like the panicked “OH SHIT GAME BREAKING GLITCH! SHUT IT DOWN! SHUT IT ALL DOWN!” And now there going to rush the fix and probably cause a new glitch to occur. They should have took the time to find a fix, test the fix and then shutdown the servers, implement the fix in a matter of minutes and turn them back on.
---
Haven't seen that one yet, but I did encounter this [epic battle of the ages](https://imgur.com/Y8UVXSS) yesterday
---
No problem, heads up you need to be the pylon 60 times for the Electrician Oppossum Scout Challenge
---
Why must you all be so rude? I was going for the Scottish flag! If I wanted to make it Confederacy I’d make it have more stars and red
---
You can’t craft it without catching one
---
Nah, an exploit and a bug are completely different. An exploit requires someone using the bug. Intentionally or not. When they took the servers offline, there was no longer and exploit. No players, nothing being exploited, no exploit. The bug was still there and still had the potential to be exploited, but one of the key components - a player - wasn't present.
---
Ya, but they take up quite a bit of build budget, and the my personal terminal looks better, and you use it for other stuff as well, so it would be awesome to be able to use it for the games as well.
---
Two! They are pretty small
---
No, of course I know that but there panicking trying to find a fix.
---
Is the game down right now because of duper’s? What’s going on
---
Maintenance is over so I'm going to figure out what I'm short to build that card and give it another try. 
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
Sure. Glad to share my thinking. 
---
I don’t consider it a factor because the BOS mod plan costs &lt;90 caps at the Grafton Train station. Most any player can add the BOS mod. It’s a great mod. It’s just not worth much. 
---
Heavy vs sturdy vs light cannot be changed. Non-BOS heavy should be more valuable than similar BOS light.
---
Doesn't really bother be because if i need a photo for a challenge i can just pacify the animal and run up close.
---
And it really doesn't matter outside of challenges because it isn't saved to the photo anyways
---
I’ll check today and get back with you here!
---
Hey there!  I'm the one who made that random encounter map. I haven't been updating it, mostly because I realized someone would eventually make a complete map from the game data. 
---
There must be a way to find out which coordinates are the actual spawn locations, as opposed to triggers. Can you tell me how to find the coordinates in xedit? Just poking around, I can only seem to find the "nodes" that reference each type of encounter, but I can't find anything that looks like map coordinates for the nodes.
---
Right, show me how they are panicking? Or maybe its simply that theyre fixing the problem as soon as it made its way from community manager to dev?
---
Past caught dupers where forgiven and allowed back into the game is what stings to me.
---
If you can just screenshot your surroundings and then your map then I can work out what's going on and where you are. Thank you!
---
It took me like an hour to do that shit about 3 weeks ago I'm glad I don't have to repeat it
---
Servers are back
---
He's a totally click/rage bait harvester.
---
The tax is no different than a mechanic used in many other games.
---
An employee  F'd up but they pulled the content and apologized as soon as informed.
---
Curses they may add a Fridge to the Atom Shop, you filthy P2W losers that like to stack up on food. Except you can get a Fridge mod for your backpack.
---
The horrors of all of that.
---
YYYYYYYEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
Time to server hop and harvest all the weight sets before anyone else ....
---
Ahh Gotcha.  Thank you for explaining!
---
It’s back up
---
This would be great. The normal terminal is just...Really shabby, I want to play my holotape games on an advanced quality system, not a makeshift terminal with dubious processing power.
---
If someone enjoys eating rotten food, should you?
---
I heard it’s for another duplication exploit that was knackering server stability again.
---
Suprised the ban hammer didn't fall on those who knowingly recieved ill gotten goods. 
---
If you bought a tv you know was stolen you would be charged with recieving stolen goods.... Just a thought.
---
I actually was just chatting with a guy that quit last year that came back just before the vending machines.  He had 10s of thousands of pounds of stuff in his stash due to some exploit.  I didn't hear the details, but it was something along the lines of if it was put in some certain container it would show up in your stash regardless of the limit.   Instead of dumping/selling like we would usually do when we hit the stash limit he would just cram more stuff in there. The exploit was patched since but they left his stuff alone, so when he came back it was still all there.
---
So I guess I'll forget about that melting robots challenge......
---
So, he stared pvp which is part of the game and you participated in pvp and lost.
---
It's part of the game.
---
Don't want to deal with pvp? Stay off survival, turn on passive (you can't hurt others and others can't hurt you) don't take ANY workshops (they open you to pvp across the map) and don't fight back.
---
They will get bored and move on but it's honestly part of the game.
---
Map updated [here](https://i.imgur.com/HzUrefq.jpg). Hope it's easier to see.
---
Is this confirmed? Because that’s the last thing I did before I logged off yesterday so that’s awesome 😂
---
Lmfao I think youre the one who needs to reevaluate.
---
There will be a lot of Ski Swords, Rolling Pins, Quitar Swords and Golf Clubs for sale soon. I am sure these items have like +50% more chance to drop in loot table. From the armor section we will see a lot of Wood stuff.
---
The hero we deserve.
---
You have to make a character named "Salty Pete" and wear the pirate hat, and then go to the edge of the map starting at the NW, drop all the stuff you want duped in a paper bag, then move around the edge of the map counter clockwise using only jumps not ever allowing your AP to run out. Once you've made it around to your original location, with your final jump you have to land exactly on the paper bag you dropped or it won't work. Finally you punch yourself in the face 3 times, now quickly pickup your bag, voila duplicates!
---
If you're going to run low health to take advantage of your adrenal reaction mutation you may want to consider this set up: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4c455bf&amp;d=a72lr1l71l11lu2lt2a31sa0pg2ib1pp2ph2eo1eh1pi2a01ar1an1ir2cm1cu2sg2la1lv0&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=269cedif
---
excellent!
---
YOU'RE NOT MY SUPERVISOR!!
---
I wonder what they worked on. Since we had 2 other updates this week
---
The new update exposed an easier way to dupe from what I've read on here.  Bethesda took down Fallout 76 to fix an exploit so it's assumed to fix this new and easier way to dupe.  At least we hope.
---
I had it the other way around last night. Last man standing.  
---
Session started as usual, spawn in, few minutes later a dozen people arrive as nose through the for sale stuff.  
---
And then nothing. I opened the map to go and check out a few other camps and ... nothing. Totally empty map. No camp shop markers, no other player markers, nothing. Travelled to WS, did a loop, nothing, Watoga, West-Tec, all empty.  
---
Was slightly unsettling for some reason.
---
Maintenance concluded my fellow dwellers
---
We did it in the little river in the golf course at withesprings, just let a lvl 60+ ugly ghoul kick your ass and voilà
---
Thx!
---
Same! It just let me on (PC)
---
Most likely, a fix for a new duping method.
---
Sorry dude, servers are back up, got better things to do now than chat with you. Enjoy your weekend.
---
HUZZAH!!
---
As I've said - Mob spawns are clearly a highly desired thing but unfortunately I can't do them yet. If you want just some ad-hoc tips I'll draw you one quick.
---
[This is just from memory](https://i.imgur.com/LnewfTZ.jpg)
---
TL;DR: Fuck no
---
Yeah, me too. I thought it was just a nice surprise.
---
Papa makes an excellent point. That encounter is simply about build and gear but it is more than just being high dps. I let other people handle the DPS when I go to the event, I pick up the pylons and hold the robot in position for people to be able to dps. I'm standard heavy weapons build, power armor, and using a Vampire Minigun. My health gauge looks like a seisomograph, only danger is during reloads (hint: I run around screaming with stimpak running while gun reloads).
---
Not till they fix how to make things touch the ground. If houses are already floating, just open up the build editor.
---
Ok, try it another way... Maintenance repairs gradual ongoing damage over time to the whole, patching changes a specific thing and that alone.  
---
Is your machine maintenance timetabled in advance? You know you'll be running maintenance on this bunch of hardware a week on Thursday, and again in around 3 months time? And then there's a bang from that other piece of hardware and smoke comes out of the vent, so you have to repair a specific fault immediately?   
---
Maybe using the term 'maintenance' is a customer service trick to minimise the impression that stuff keeps breaking and needs immediate fixing without notice, but it's not widespread enough here (UK) to have changed the meaning to include that usage (yet)
---
It is Bethesda's fault. Duping would not be possible if their code didn't suck.
---
Ahhh, you're right. I forget that Bethesda is notorious about protecting their IP. It's a shame. All this work you put in could be a game changer. I'll definitely be saving this thread to keep an eye on the updates.
---
You're in an accident. Is it wrong for you to expect people to call an ambulance or help you? I guess you would prefer it if people will just leave you there. They might not feel in the mood to help you. Maybe you shouldn't have gotten in that accident in the first place. It's all **your** problem. Call the ambulance yourself.

I was thinking that too at first but everyone seems to have it so it might have been an unintended gift on Beths part.

How could they not see after the last three games with super weak rippers that rippers were still incredibly weak and nobody used them? 
---
Do they even play their own game at all? I don’t think they do.
---
Lol the problem is that I wander too much really and end up in some precarious situations. It's been pretty awesome though. All I did was send a message to the closest high level player and asked for some help killing an enemy that was 20+ levels above me and they responded immediately and came to help me out. It was awesome. It definitely makes the game exponentially better than a lot of online stuff I've done.
---
If they push out products as fast as possible why haven't they switched to a yearly release schedule and instead take years between releases, even of their 'cash grabs' like Fallout 76?
---
I’m loving the vendor setup.  Already made easily 10k in just decent gear, aid, mags, etc.  I’ll keep my major great rolls for the market tho.
---
I only set prices on items I couldn’t be bother to use reddit for. Def saves time that way for me
---
Wow, fastest my camp has loaded in a long time!
---
That path-suggestion thing is really far out. Would you consider cliff edges and such? You'd need a real solid understanding of several algorithms for it.
---
Either way - Amazingly I've had several offers of help for potential web-apps on different platforms and such. I'll be sure to include you if something gets set up
---
Havent heard about duping on here in a while
---
Thanks my dude.
---
Ahh, ffs :( Friday night ruined, going to end up spending time with the wife at this rate.
---
Do you get 30 slots per machine?  I assumed all machines for a single character we connected the same way stash boxes are...
---
I can see brawls at the shop entrance black friday style 🤮
---
Forgive my ignorance, but is duping back? I thought they fixed that shit months ago.
---
This is the best map so far, gg weight limits.
---
Unfortunately, building a working mobile app, and building something ad-hoc at some that blurts out images are worlds apart.
---
You know, now that I have the backpack I can consider this! I passed initially as I pretty much have to chug a litre of whiskey every two minutes to be able to sprint. It's good to be able to move again, thought I doubt it will last forever, I'm a creature of habit.
---
Exactly!!  They are too lazy to play the game and get the stuff legitimately...idiots!  But they’re the first yo cry about unstable servers and how horrible the game is, forgetting the fact that they are the ones causing the issues. I hope Bethesda bans these idiots. And I don’t see the draw of duping all the god roll weapons and armor, making yourself pretty much invincible. That would take all the fun out of the game for me. No challenge left. Maybe that’s why...they’re too dumb to actually play the game.
---
One minor downside of player vending is that when I used to not really care too much if my camp spawned or not when I joined a server,  now I always want my camp to spawn as I have 4 full vending machines with a solid stream of customers coming by every time I login now. 
---
My camp location is a popular one. It was covered by at least two popular You Tubers (Final Render and Jug I believe) and I am able to get a spawn about 60-70% of the time when I join a server. 
---
I picked it by just wandering and exploring. It’s my second camp. My first was at the north end of the Tyler Fairgrounds, east of the Tyler Dirt Track. I like to go up there for just nostalgic purposes every once in a while. I was a complete n00b and built it too close to consistent Scorched spawn points. Granted, they are like Level 1-5, but still. 
---
That fairground is still a great place to Farm plastic though!
---
I originally picked it because my favorite DLC from FO4 was Nuka World and it loosely reminded me of it. I was too low level to go to Camden at that point. I tried Ave was killed instantly a few times by mid-low level scorched over there, so I stuck to Tyler. But hey, there’s a consistent Caps Stash and Bobble spawn point there! :)
---
Everything.
---
Fantastic work, thanks for all of this!
---
Yeah, I wish it would have stayed that way... but at least they seem to be fixing it quickly.
---
just bash them with flamer
---
I saw something similar on the southeast side of WS. I heard all hell breaking loose with the robots and went to check it out and the sheepsquach was trashing the robots.  I watch for a while because it cool and I figured I would let the robots do most of the dirty work.  I put in a few rounds while hidden and then finished off the sheepsquach once all the robots were dead.  I got a 1* lifesaving wood leg out of the deal.
---
Should work fine, I have a GTX 1060 and can run at 60 FPS all day long on maxed out settings
---
Is duping occurring again?
---
If I see 5.56 being sold at 1 cap a round, I just buy it all.  You could be selling 10k, and I'll buy it all.
---
.308 at 2 caps per round also flies out the door.  I've been picking up every round I find out in the wild and literally cannot keep it in stock.
---
Hoping servers isn't a garuntee, I've been placed on the same server several times in server hops, this was certified by a bad of items that I left to test the theory that I was being placed on the same server....
---
Sometimes it works, sometimes it's the same damn server over and over...
---
I was attacked by a sheepsquatch while shopping at someone's camp today, first time I've seen one outside of the event.
---
I had that encounter in the toxic valley by Charleston
---
More than likely they just duped the same shit that was already duped twice-over because they're idiots who got things spoon-fed to them. Highly doubtful a god roll worth chasing dropped that would have affected the market. If anything it makes prices go down as more items become available
---
I honestly have no idea how to dupe an item.  I won't ask, but I'm curious what the actual effect in-game happens to be due to people doing it.  How is affecting you, OP?
---
Mostly just the amount of server crashes in my expierence. The only time I get a lot of crashes is when talks of dupe glitches come up. I'm on ps4. Although I'm pretty much just used to everyonr having a tse handmade or lever action at this point. Sometimes an odd tse minigun or machine gun too I suppose.
---
Its Clancy Manor to the left of Hemlock Holes. On the 2nd floor next to a tinkers table is a stack of 3 military grade tape. Its been there everytime I go through the area. 
---
I'm simply concerned that some items might be slipping through the cracks be it fiber or other items.
---
Your main issues with lag in 76 almost always come from either the GPU or server side lag. Your i5 should work just fine
---
Why explosive isn’t a primary effect I will never understand
---
Holy shit i had the same thing happen to me.
---
I put a supply drop holotape for sale and it glitched out, my 160 holotapes turned into 5000.
---
The catch is that i couldn't remove them, every time i tried to cancel the sale it added another one to the list and when i tried picking them up it said that i was max weight.
---
Hope they don't ban me or anything because i was just trying to get the holotapes out of my stash so they wont multiply :(
---
I’ve been collecting good pieces since the beginning, meaning legendary. 
---
The main reasons I’m asking is mainly due to seeing way overpriced stuff out there. 
---
I’m basically looking for a good reference to go by, not just looking to make caps since I have plenty and had to move them over with help from a friend to my secondary character I’m building up now at lvl 42. 
---
Seems legendary armor is few and far between at times or getting something that doesn’t compliment your build.
---
Way easier!
---
He pretty much says all that.
---
They are called open prisons and its still very much illegal to just leave the place without a permit.
---
y i k e s
---
Yep, that's exactly what mine was too. Supply holotape. I'm just glad they dont weigh anything. As a level 88 I have no use for them lol.
---
Took a day off so I can enjoy some quality FO76 uninterrupted gaming... as a father, home owner, husband, well you know how it is.  So I feel ya, man lol.
---
Yes 30 per machine.  And it is!
---
There’s a difference between “very high damage” that removes all challenge, including things like worrying about weapon degrading and carrying ammo because you can one shot everything, and “viable” which is all the over repaired ripper was.
---
The hero we needed! 😍
---
I’m loving it. Selling stuff left and right.
---
Some people find their fun in different places.  I see very little problem with people discovering tricks and hacks to improve their enjoyment of the game, as long as they're not directly impacting the experience for other people.
---
PC: SirGrinch -- Whatever I don't Use and can fit in my Stash :-)..
---
Sometimes you can sell it to a vendor the immediately buy it back.  This makes technical documents activate.
---
Missiles and upgraded machine guns do the issue no problem. I found the others mostly useless.
---
Is it possible to have this as an overlay mod in-game? Personally don't find it ALL that useful because the map isn't that granular so those locations dots aren't that precise.
---
Weird glitches, server instability, more frequent disconnects, lag. It can be pretty frustrating.
---
This post was made by **Smash Players' Gang**
---
Oh wow - thanks for the info!
---
I'm guessing my 2 shot Flamer I'm holding on to should take a trip to the grinder?
---
Yeah. Dupers ruin games
---
Maintenance is over by the way. Though strangely, I got an endless black screen when I started the game... had to restart my xbox to launch the game properly.
---
Not true I love the option in case I’m out of mats dubhhhh
---
Last resort last 10% of the weapon health does double damage.
---
This needs to be the pinned post for this sub
---
at least now people dont get so hostile when you're checking out their base. I used to check out peoples bases for inspiration for designs and you'd swear I was raiding them in rust lol. Now i buy one or two things and just chill around and they're cool about it.
---
Holy shit thank you!
---
It stores everything if you move it
---
When I realized I could pull from my inventory at the same time a player was buying from a machine, I wondered if there might not be an exploit opportunity. There's a reason robot vendors only interface with one player at a time.
---
Ya, or the sparking, i don’t want to get electrocuted whenever i wanna game man
---
Good to know thanks for the tip!
---
Pleasant valley station has the mod!
---
You may need to re-enable them in the atom shop, go in and see if they're checkmarked
---
He means a Bethesda employee should buy the weapon in person (in game) and ban them right there to surprise them.
---
Beth won't ban people who bought a duped one because they most likely didn't know. Look at all the duped weapons running around now still in the game.
---
It will be knocked down stored and blue printed
---
For ammo, id never buy anything over 1:1, thats the price in all trading subs
---
Wouldn't the Irish flag be way more appropriate for freedom to base it upon and you can dodge the confederate accusations, it's still a really nice flag and it fits thematically with the free states (confederates) in the east and the enclave (unionists) to the west
---
I use the base price of the game 🤓
---
didnt work
---
I got a TSE Flamer that dropped from a ghoul.. it completely obliterates glowing ones.
---
Definitely one of my favorite guns despite the sad sad amount of ammo you can craft.
---
I love it! 
---
I hope you Will make one about The Wendigo, or the Grafton Monster (since those are my two favorite enemies from the game)
---
More the servers should be more stable.
---
Yeah that's what I meant lol. No idea why youd get downvoted for that lol it it was super easy I woulda gotten the cameras a while ago
---
Nobody mentioned it yet? Craft rubber helmets (what is their name in English?) en masse and get 25 caps for each! It costs virtually nothing, just some rubber and plastic and glass.
---
I really need to Finsh my new playthough of 2 again.
---
O prefer the shotgun turret. Takes them out faster and is less indiscriminate in its targets.
---
This takes out having to get ghoul to kill you in one spot and in just enough damage to leave you savable. The height of this bridge will kill you just enough and you only have to place your character in the right spot.
---
Sorry bud, would have been your friend but you’re on PS4.
---
Lol. I operate on a "2 for me, 1 for fun" rule
---
Except that they keep reintroducing some of the same glitches and exploits over and over again.. I'd say that they share some of the blame here for being inept.
---
Like people have pointed out this is a problem that exist because bethseda has kept choking the economy with cap limits, vendor limits, and terrible drop rates. I mean how can they expect to keep item values below 25k when you can earn that in a 2-3 weeks selling to vendors but never get anything like a single BE handmade or Assassin Sentinel from a drop in months of playing the game? With the cap limits rare items like that will never be able to have a true cap value and along with the vendor limits players will never be able to farm for wealth to buy them even if they did. So were stuck with trust trades and exchanging items for items. So if by chance after 6 months of playing and you do get that god roll item you have to choose to i keep it or try to risk trading it to another player for a different god roll item you want because items are the only currency that matters and you're ability to really increase you're in game wealth is not based on farming but abysmal luck granted to you by bethseda. If you only played with the drops you've gotten in game because most of what has been on the market was duped would you still be playing. After 700 hrs my best weapon would be a level 15 TSE handmade which got nerfed to garbage and I still bet I would be doing better than most people.
---
A working fast travel mat would be best. Too many people build on cliffs for a spawn to be outside the build border. I built my camp atop Seneca Rocks, fast travel to its border would drop everyone off the side.
---
Cool, I'm not too picky yet. I'll add ya and check in this weekend.
---
You had me until PS4
---
Is it showing them there with a price again or does it say you own them?
---
Lmao yeah ok guy,
---
It's not stealing if they dropped it to get rid of it.
---
The only viable flamer use in fo4 was the vats no ammo use glitch
---
60 seconds
---
It’s my understanding they’re not in the game yet...unconfirmed tho
---
Not everyone can spend 60 bux (or even less) just to find out if they like the game. Some people have very limited budget so want to be very sure before they spend it.
---
Whew, I was worried people wouldn't get the reference. I've started a new run myself recently to match along MATN's play through of it
---
Luckily you don't have rent, utilities, stock or any of the costs of owning a small business in 76.  Owning a small business in real life, a day where you only have a handful of customers is like watching yourself slowly starve to death with no resources left to fix the problem.  I ran a small skate-shop back in the late 90's and had to close after two years.  The craziest two years of my life.  I tried local ads, stickers and shirts, skate demos, setting up a website and participating in the online skate community, you name it.  There was just too much competition, but I did gift my loyal homies with some freebies, just to say thanks in some small way for their dedicated support, when it was time to shut the door for good.

---
I tend to make it where it's easier for others. Not based off what the market goes by.
---
Literally had a player charge me 6,000 caps for an imposter Sheepsquatch set. I didn't have it and had to give up high value items so that I could get it. He was trying to calculate it off of some sort of market price. Just throw a price you feel you would buy and what would be best for them.
---
Sometimes your blueprint will have trouble if youre moving it  to a place where it should not go. I find just building back up is the easiest if you have trouble replacing.
---
You must run back and forth in the water that's a fact yeah 😅 the ghoul was mid-life so as soon as my savior went down I finished the ghoul and revived him.
---
Not sure what this all means but if you need help ping me, Im PC as well :)
---
Okay thanks now i'll cry.
---
it says owned and now the emotes are out of order
---
Is it? I honestly am not sure, all my weapons that have it are 3*. I lose track of a lot of the ones like VATS hit chance that I don't ever care for, so I can't figure it out through relation either
---
I don’t get people plays games for ego should be for fun and progression and that eliminates the whole point in my eyes
---
I've moved mine and I spawned a tad bit further from my camp in the water. I love my CAMP so much but half the time I go there I end up getting parasites or something from spawning in the water.
---
That's actually a really good point, something to be aware of, for sure.
---
Wanna? Saw another post that the bridge in Charleston is a good spot
---
Found one in a random container in Phillipi cemetery. So they exist.
---
You’re the reason why the economy is the way it is and why caps are useless.
---
But then you'd miss out on the architect nightmares players call camps. 🤣
---
240 *is* excessive. I kept running out when I was low level so I carefully grabbed everyone I could find. Then got Pharma Farma for a second chance at every med kit. Plus pharmacist and Super Duper. One day around level 100 I realized my carry weight was super high. Added Better Inventory and realized that even with the 90% weight reduction the 310 stimpacks I'd accumulated  over 70 levels of hoarding and avoiding using them weighed 31 pounds.
---
So while I can see having 240 stimpacks, there's no way I could see legitimately accumulating 24000.
---
thank you.
---
Same here I been trying not to rush the game. I beat fallout 1 the same day he put the first one out. At that point I was just screaming at the videos. This time I'm letting him stay ahead of me so I get that oh yeah and I forgot about that experience. Much more enjoyable.
---
And the sheepsquatch set goes for like 1k now
---
That's not "completely" different, they're literally both bugs, it's just that one requires active participation by a player. Like I said. The rest is just arguing semantics. "Fixing an exploit" may not be correct under the strictest of terms, but the intent is still clearly communicated. They're fixing a bug that can be exploited. They really don't need extra words to explain what everyone already deduced.
---
That makes me want to tell them not to play even more. And no one spends 60 bucks on this game is they r smart. Check amazon and its always around 30ish.
---
If they cant afford 30ish then I recommend getting a job and not playing video games all day.
---
Haha ya good luck getting the attention of people to explain quantitative and qualitative data + techniques when they won’t even touch fallout 76 cus it isn’t made by obsidian (a company in the dumpster today) I don’t think the problem is people don’t know things like this it’s just they rather ignore facts for their circle jerk agenda or whatever
---
Seems like you’re just looking for things to be upset about. Try replacing your camp on the map, might help with foot traffic
---
You need to make sure they're enabled in the atom shop, then go to your emote wheel and "expand" on some emotes if needed to select your purchased ones.
---
Walls and structure aren't that bad, it's the decoration density. Super detailed interiors chew through your limit really quickly.
---
Thank you guys for the responses.  Looks like I won't be using demolition expert then.  I didn't think it affected the molotovs.
---
Ya, there is a lot of interesting combo's in gear I would like to try. I have a set of non-matching weightless armor I might give a try one day. In my drops experience of 100's+ legendarily, weight reductions seems to be really rare. I kept them all and I only have like total of 4. Player vending should be interesting on the day this update drops.
---
Question: does the reload offset the usefulness of the gun that much, or is it trivial in most cases? I'm selling a 1* vampire's LMG and 1* vampire's .50 cal in my shop, I have the .50 cal listed higher because it can give better sustained healing over time vs the LMG needing to reload so often. Am I wrong in doing that?
---
So butt hurt lol. No I don't expect people to help me just because, real life you can only depend on yourself.  But in the video game if you consider getting people to help you kill some enemies the same thing as calling the ambulance for someone than maybe you do need more help. Maybe get an alarm sirens for your camp so someone can turn it on when enemies are close lol
---
It’s actually valuable to make antibiotics and healing salve.  If stimpaks weren’t so damn heavy I’d be carrying 200 as well.  They are easy to make and acquire. 
---
The Super Duper perk might be one of the best out there and the beauty of it is you only need to access it when crafting stuff.
---
Dang, it ended literally seconds after I booted up a different game it seems. Good luck with the event then
---
yikes, figured it might be that bad, bet it was to do with vendors, knew they were to laggy to be safe
---
Someone said you could rearrange them.
---
Awesome post!
---
Lol it wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so widley shared to the point they have to patch the game who the fuck duped 600 handmades at once. Lol mfrs getting greedy.
---
The machines are only 3 power each, stick a windmill or something on the farthest-from-muties edge of the camp.
---
i lnow that but im missing the ones that are default now
---
It only clears one slot.
---
I submitted another ticket and spoke with a different rep. We must’ve been some of the first to have the issue because he told me that it is a widespread problem and they’re working to resolve it. Stay tuned I guess lol.
---
You win.
---
Ack, you weren't supposed to read that! Forgive me, hammer time!
---
Maybe give them their caps back? If that's possible
---
I found that one too
---
I'm assuming that since the Sheepsquatch is out, the value of items before hand drops.
---
Every item before another item usually drops because it's not a big item to find and isn't really requested as much.
---
I'd be willing to bet a nickel that the saaaaaaame assholes that were begging to be let  back in the last time ("I played 900 hours!") will be the saaaaaaaaame asshole that are doing it this time.
---
I had a dude show up at my CAMP last night, no hello, no nothing. Just stripped out of his power armor, took a shower, and laid down for a nap in my guest bed.  I didn't mind, but he made it seem more like trespassing than anyone else so far. I think if  you're being respectful no one's going to see it as trespassing.
---
Because they are living in mommy and daddy's basements not working like the rest of us and have all the time in the world to play games all day and look for this crap! Just play the F'ing game!
---
It's probably only scripted to picking up a magazine actually in the world from a world spawn.
---
I did that quest about 3 times over... I'm still not done yet.
---
First, weight reduction perks don't apply to your stash, which is what the machine pulls from. Second, there's no perk combo i nthe game that will bring the weight of 30K+ explosives weigh less than 800 pounds. There's definitely something fucky going on in that guy's screenshot.
---
Yeah I know someone thats going to be sleeping out in the Mire tonight :P
---
I play on and off, I already finished the gecko-VC situation and redding a week or two ago and drove down to SF to buy some high tier gear. I'll probably do BH once I play the game again, but not sure when that might be, so he might end up doing it before me
---
Thanks! (also I got that poster framed and hanging over my work area now!)
---
Fair enough.
---
50 seems to be the average. I've seen as low as 10 and as high as 200.
---
I'm having a really hard time. I met both of the scout bots and did those little challenges. Did the Athletic Badge. But I need another something so I can get a backpack but I haven't had a chance to revive anyone yet
---
Plus Chemist.  I am trying to cut down, but too much stuff to sell already.
---
LOL.  When I was killing a yao-guai with a bleed-out syringer, I was wondering how a teenage boy would ever be expected to do this.  Or kill a wolf with a knife.  LOL.  West Virginian children must be of very hardy stock.
---
I bought several 3* weapons before the server shut down for under 150 caps.   And a damn well viable shotgun under 300.:.. I’m genuinely a smidge concerned.
---
Almost everything they listed was listed at face value though. So 50/50
---
Don’t sale items show up twice in your stash?  Very odd.  At least that’s what I thought I saw this morning.  Or maybe I shouldn’t have pounded a bottle of grain alcohol beforehand.
---
That's like 4gb shy of the full game... A rebuild?
---
"+10% damage to an enemy type you literally never see"
---
Lots of folks over-value their stuff.  Don’t suppose they sell much.
---
No, buy serums cheap, then sell them expensive to other players. Better Best method. Trust me.
---
It's BMWs fault... I wouldn't speed if the car couldn't do 200 km/h.
---
It's McDonald's fault, I wouldn't be fat if their food wasn't so high in calories.
---
It's his fault, I wouldn't have stolen his TV if he'd locked his door.
---
Bullshit. Just play the fuckin' game... you can't find this shit and exploit it, unless you're actively looking for it.
---
I haven't gotten anything yet.
---
Ok, why not make it so the ammo costs, 40 times more material to make and it degrades 60 or 70 times faster. I would still use it
---
For ammo, I go 1:1 or 1:2 depending on the type. Bulk junk I do 25 or 50, unbulked I usually do 5 and 10. My weapons and armor I try to be subjective as to what I'd pay for them they range from a few hundred to a 3* explosive Gatling gun I have at 4500, I'm happy to let it sit at that price for a while. Recipes and low level plans range 25-100. Power armor plans from 200-500 depending on what it is.
---
You Need two more badges as well.
---
Wait, is there a way for them to not activate? I'd love to be able to stack the non-quest item version and 'activate' them one at a time.
---
Third squee here DO IT.
---
Nice I 100% Klamath and just waiting for him to get a little bit further ahead of me. Probably going to catch him in my next actually play session
---
I spent an hour fine placing my camp module to get the fast travel point right. It fucking sucks for me myself. But other players always spawn in front of the main door which is what I wanted.
---
That's how it always is for stuff like this. The only people who complain are the people who only want the reward.
---
So you're being serious when you say that 90% of the time when someone doesn't like how their voice sounds (not the one they hear inside but how their voice sounds to others) others find their voice the sweetest sound ever?
---
Really?
---
Placated?  Is that like code for a bow chicky wow wow
---
I regularly have a total of over 17,000 rounds of ammo for sale at my camp (all competitively priced ;^) ) but that's about it. Would purple think I'm 'duping'? What is duping anyways? The Super Duper perk?
---
Sticky this shit.
---
I just make up the prices as I go.  I have no idea what most of it is worth but in the end it doesn't really matter much because a) the currency is made up b) you have a cap max that can be easily hit with in game vendors and c) if people want it bad enough, they will pay and I want to get rid if it bad enough in will dump the price.
---
Prolly cause it allows u to play games 🙈
---
It’s sucks there’s people who take advantage of stuff like this. There are guys on facebook duping Old man winter masks and they’re asking for real money!!! I wish we live in a world where people wouldn’t take advantage of all this. I personally hope Bethesda has a way of following the item ID trail and all these people get some sort of consequences.
---
Thanks man you too :)
---
It's bizarre.  As if the game is being downloaded again...but I can still play it.
---
Lmao damn
---
Lol should have told me. I sold all mine for 5 caps each
---
for plans I notice the weapons and armor obviously go for more, anywhere from 500-5k caps depending on the plan. for decoration camp plans I rarely see anything over 1k caps.
---
Completely agree. A small QoL request would be an ability to leave a note at a camp you visit for the owner to see when they return. Yes, I know we can just message through our platforms, but I’m old school, direct electronic messaging at times seems too forward for the lighthearted things I want to tell this random camp owner I don’t know and may never meet.
---
Nice job, thanks 👍🏼
---
Relogging several times still didn’t fix it for me. Probably going to have to wait until next update.
---
I still need the revive one as well. Hard to get as a solo player.
---
That deathclaw pic is really something. Great shot.
---
Definitely got the Wendigo on my list, I'll have to add the Grafton Monster.
---
Anyone with half a brain would of been duping legacy weapons... And this would be a big problem.
---
I'm having the same issue. Have you found a solution yet?
---
Some nice interiors behind those dumb locked doors
---
I am mountain time only on an hour or two in the later evenings but I’m down A_Small_Sedan
---
I was too lucky on my first foundation placement, and everything lines up so well. It's built around a substation and really only has a a couple walls that have metal going through them.
---
Due to the size of connected structure I know I wouldn't find a working spot, or rebuild it as perfectfit as I did. 
---
It will stay. :(
---
HOLY F***in S*** you have to disable em then close app then open it back up then re enable them at least it worked for me
---
you blame the dupers and not the shit hole game? your priorities are messed up. the games been out 6 months and i can still dupe to this date and have accounts with 10's of millions of nearly everything.  you're all sheep who support this game... but thankfully sheep but dolla dalla bills in my wallet. so BAAAAAAAAAAA!
---
One thing i heard is that the Wendigo Sometimes hangs in trees, but i havent confirmed it tho
---
Honestly it should just be a primary imo I mean wtf
---
They even reference reddit threads that are the exact opposite. People calmly discussing the fee, why it exists, and how it is a good thing.
---
They added backpacks lol increase carry weight by 60 for standard lv 50 backpack. Power armor is ok but i only really use excavator with callibrated shocks increase carry weight to 420. Theres a new camera in game you have to start a quest for it. Theres the sheep squatch event like a queen but faster. Buffed some weapons. You can craft alcohol now at your brew station. Theres a bunch of stuff to do oh they also nerfed exp on green ones and killed whitesprings ghoul respawns you have to go really far away now and there has to be nobody at golf club for respawn.
---
I sold a few magazines at 75 caps though ive seen them at 100 though the market for mags is probably small depending on its perk. Ammo should be 1cap unless its ultracite or cores. 1 star items should probably be no more than 1000 but 500 is probably top end depending on the perk and id multiply that based on stars. Unless its a god item of course.
---
Any plans over 1000 caps better be rare. Ive bought several PA plans at 1000 or less so seeing them for more is a turn off. Event plans can probably net good caps, pioneer scout, biv recipes sheepsquatch stuff since alot of people are over doing those events. You can start high well maybe not for the biv ones unless its a rarer plan like nuka dark.
---
I do half of the value usually. Magazines are 25 caps except the stealth boy one, which I do for 100 caps since I figure PVP players would use it.
---
nvm thank you for your help no less i fixed it
---
But what if the damn console becomes sentient and strangles you in the middle of the night?!
---
Should have deleted ALL duped items in the first place.  I admit I bought stuff on reddit..... If it was duped and it got deleted it wouldn't be the end of the world. I would have actually been relieved knowing all duped items were gone.
---
I WILL ACCEPT MY FATE.  IT’S SKYNET TIME.
---
&gt; It's 100% reasonable to expect that a product for which you exchange money be free of fault.
---
Reasonable by what standard? Considering virtually every large-scale online game has bugs and exploits, I feel like you'd have to be particularly optimistic or gullible to expect that.
---
&gt; We as consumers choose to give companies a break most of the time 
---
No, we don't. Every big online game has exploits and bugs, and every time the community discovers one its forums and communities are filled with people calling for the developers heads - or at the least, their jobs.
---
&gt;Eventually you have to man up and put the blame where it's deserved: they fucked up; again.
---
I'm not sure what "manning up" has to do with it, but blame should be cast on a case-by-case basis. In this instance, I don't see any reasonable way to expect the 76 team to anticipate the frankly bizarre ways people go about exploiting these things.
---
Meh I've gotten so frustrated I'm just doing other stuff
---
Step 1: Find someplace with Mr Handys or Eyebot
---
Step 2: Take out your ~~trusty~~ Flamer, and do something nobody would ever think of doing in real life: smack them around with it ~~to show dominance~~
---
Step 3: ???
---
Step 4: **PROFIT**
---
I haven't seen anything.
---
Were you one of the people using the exploit?
---
S’mores recipe dropped for me off the campfire tales event at Camp Adams.
---
Sell me your hide lol
---
I never plan to use real money or a trade forum to find weapons, I believe in finding crap rolls for myself until I get a decent one. Trading seems too much like pay to win to me
---
Happened to me, I fast traveled from and to my camp and everything was back
---
Oh wow, thats crazy. Ive been out of the market on ammo for 3 weeks or so, but damn. I wish i was still grinding ammo. Ill post 20k to 40k at a time. Oh well, its nice to have people come to me. Maybe ill try to player vendor my next batch at a cap each and see how it goes.
---
Add me, I can help you launch that nuke! PSN Cirdloc
---
Good try Bethesda.
---
I just started so I can’t wait to have these experiences (even though by the looks of my world there isn’t ever many people) 😁
---
Dupers help bring order to chaos!
---
I try to keep my prices reasonably low to encourage players to buy more from me.
---
TSEs are still good to go. My AAE handmade and combat shotgun have plenty to rearrange someone’s face.  Add in the perks and chems and it’s like holding an A10 Warthog in your hands.
---
Lol, on Xbox that goes for max or higher.
---
To my knowledge and please if I'm wrong, correct me people, the vampire effect is a heal over time that has a fixed amount of healing and can stack unlimited amount. So it comes down to triggers per second and uptime. With the minigun I'm attacking 21 times per second for 23 seconds with a 2.5s reload time so approximately 90% healing uptime. 50cal would be 9 times per second for 28 seconds followed by reload so about equivalent uptimes given attack rate and magazine size but less healing unless the proc chance differs by weapon? I dont have an LMG on me to compare the values.  
---
The LMG will be more accurate but that ammo is a pain to sustain where as the 50 cal is much easier and I believe the minigun has the highest healing rate. As such I would price them in that order from least to highest.
---
You make a good point--while testing it, that was the one variable that I should've locked down.  I'd like to further investigate the issue, but I don't have Herd Mentality^(\*) as of this morning.  
---
In the past, I think I was also getting debuffed by Blight or something similar each time I noticed the problem.  I also think I may have been too far from my teammates to get the benefit instead of the penalty.  I typically only end up in teams for SBQ fights, and it seems like I always immediately get Blight when she does her acid strafe.  I'm not sure which of the two was de-buffing my Charisma.
---
Anyway, I'll look for it next time I'm in a team SBQ fight and see what I can see.  I know for sure that I was unable to keep my 'best' perks shared, but I was able to attempt to do so.  I think it's a case of my base Charisma being 9 and that allows me to flag a card as shared, but as noted a couple of patches ago, the share is broken if you dip below the required Charisma level.
---
^(\*I can't investigate the Herd Mentality aspect since, due to recent vending and affordable serum availability, I was able to cure myself of Herd Mentality and Speed Demon (wasn't worth the penalty since Class Freak and Rad-X don't mitigate it), and instead of using the homebrew method of bathing in rads and toggling Starched Genes to catch-em-all, I'm just injecting myself with the ones I lost that I want to regain when I can find them for around 300 caps.  The only ones I haven't regained that I really miss are Healing Factor and Bird Bones.)
---
Very true or they sell the most common crap. Nobody needs a park grill, molerat recipes or 38 ammo outside of new players and their camp is in the mire.
---
Actually like most things in life both parties share responsibility and blame
---
&gt;just because, real life you can only depend on yourself.
---
Dear lord you must have had a really hard life if this is the way you're thinking... I honestly hope you'll get better.
---
Helping and being helped by strangers is one of our strengths as humans. I won't continue this conversation, i don't want to push you too hard. 
---
If there's one thing i'd like you to remember is that you can rely on others; it's not a weakness.
---
SwankieDaddy and SwankieLady both on Xbox! One at Whitesprings south of the train station and the other near the station at Watoga!
---
I went to 3 camps all had 20-30 armor and weapons listed... all of them were non legendary and for example a price of a lvl 35 mini gun, again non legendary was 1600 caps... 
---
Many were as is and broken or almost dead health bars... 
---
Flip side I’ve seen a ton of great camps!
---
I'll try later.  Thanks.  I was overweight without the leg.  I'll transfer weight and try your method tonight.
---
I’m available now(sorry had work), don’t know if you are still on or not lol
---
Where do you get the camera?
---
Yea this just started here too
---
I got in earlier in the day, but since I crashed inside it, no dice ... tried everything that support would suggest (had problems with West Tek before, so xbox off/on, 10 sec power off, deleting user data AND i did a full reinstall during the maintenace today ... and wouldnt you know, it still happens =(
---
Lol. The lack of self-awareness here is outstanding.
---
Oh... and you're welcome.
---
Hope it works for you
---
All my stuff is at least half of the base value in game, I mostly sell plans, magazines, and some other nonsense. I've made a few hundred caps, and bought two serums and three plans I've never found in game before
---
Name a single online/mmo style game that didn't experience issues with duping. Go on, I'll wait...
---
A ton of server drops but this could be due to some of the other players exploiting things. I’d just like to say from an objective perspective that this a very solid patch and you guys should be proud of this one.
---
Lmao ps4
---
This. You won the fo76 subreddit. You did it. Pack it all up, we can all go home now.
---
I beamed into someones house they had the teleport in area locked behind electric doors or something... sure am glad there was no fire in there...
---
It does not :(
---
And you would be completely wrong, I have continuously sold Items at very reasonable prices while being blasted with rude messages from those that want to sell their TSEs for 12k caps. I have also passed on weapons that I really wanted, simply because I refused to pay the overinflated prices, even though I easily could have.
---
We did it on that bridge too. Definitely the easiest way. Don’t have to deal with any mirelurks or ghouls.
---
This is a good tip BUT only bash as much as you need to, to damage the weapon. Otherwise I imagine you will be taking more time lol.
---
Aside from trivializing the game, the big problem here is that they're killing the servers by duping.  Servers used to crash all the time due to this, disconnecting everyone like you're seeing in the last few days.  I'll bet the duping has something to do with recent server instability.
---
It's the Marine Tactical Helmet, and they're good for 31 caps each with high Charisma.
---
You should be able to map the static spawns of individual pieces of bone: skull, spine, legs, etc. I'm pretty sure they are always the same. For example, all the pieces at the Whitespring Service entrance. Was this data pulled out in  your export? For concrete you can do the hard nodes as you can just mine it a few times by hand without camping there or the bags of concrete that spawn around the world.
---
Leader of the pack, death blossoms and aronholdt? farm as well as free range event in the forest.
---
Good stuff. Note that in the Fallout universe the warheads used were much smaller than those used in WW2. Smaller thermo shock, much higher radiation. So the PopSci study doesn't quite equate to the Fallout world. Still fascinating!
---
It's west of the Giant Teapot.
---
You and the other players that join have to go there at night and listen to Scout Master Penny tell a spooky story and hold off a horde of really low level enemies.
---
Shit. I was like did I seriously get so drunk I forgot I purchased a fucking cat bush? Mayyyybe I should have  not been so quick to mow my yard when those popped up in the ol’ menu.
---
There’s a dupe glitch now?
---
Pretty much. If the entire endgame is a boring, tedious grind for RNG based weapons, people will take any opportunity to make it easier. If I could get a decently priced AAE handmade for just caps by now, I'd do it in a heartbeat. It beats needing to have some godlike Sentinel + something something armor piece to trade for it.
---
I really don't care if other people are mad that others can get these strong legendaries so easily. By RNG, other people will get good shit easier than you will anyway. There's no involvement of skill or anything, it's just a stupid boring time sink designed to keep you playing the same shit over and over and over. I say if people can circumvent burnout by getting a weapon they enjoy through dupers then let them be
---
Don't think I've found Aronholdt, much appreciated, thank you.
---
Same tho
---
Can anyone 100% confirm that they are in vendors because I’ve been trying for 2 days and it’s none of them.
---
Am I able to walk from teapot to the camp?
---
One thing I need, manual input for vendor pricing. I get a lot of people are on console but the slider takes me forever to price something compared to just typing it in.
---
No you’ll be fine I play on a 1070 you’ll be all good
---
I had that happen when I fought a Legendary Sheepsquatch in that area. It also helped when a flood of ghouls came in too
---
They sell it on ebay, TSEs at one point sold for 40-60$ on there
---
It's more about the stacks of ammo weighing more than 800 lbs, i.e. exceeding the storage limit to begin with. Not so much about the actual amount of ammo.
---
This has been a high priorty for me. I've been working on figuring this out but I'm feeling a little dense. See my post here for what I've figured out in regards to the types of encounters and the problems I'm having: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5hqce/updated\_map\_of\_random\_encounter\_locations/eje29wl/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5hqce/updated_map_of_random_encounter_locations/eje29wl/)
---
These perks dont apply to storage, only your player character.
---
My current fast travel spot isn't where the original placement was. It's a bit away from it.
---
Omg yes I neeeeed it
---
Mines near the water south of the nuka cola plant and no matter how i tweak it i spawn in the water most times i travel there.  Guess it's time for a new location altogether as this one is old news.
---
Why are we still talking about duping? Wasn't this patched out months ago?
---
I saw a lvl 9 selling pipe pistols and chem bench plans. I fleet kind of sad, so I dropped them some low level legendaries and ran far away
---
Why dupe in Fallout anyway? Unless you’ve already defeated the entire game and want to go on a building spree. I have more than enough materials to build everything. I’d rather climb ranks in solo survival and find the best weapons than take all the fun out of the game with dupes,but that’s just me.
---
It's a little late to start quibbling over the definition of "reasonable," especially since it's the metric you yourself set. And since the rest of your post is largely whataboutism and red herrings, I guess we're done here.
---
Yes 60 i cant believe i wrote 20 lol note to self never reply to redit posts while on cig brake at work to easily distracted lol
---
Idk that. Anyone paying real cash for a gun has got to be the dumbest sob I've ever heard of. Kids spending there lunch money just to have a new hot stuff. That's just insane.
---
Artillery pieces in camp had a box that you got flares from. It was also linked to the stash in a weird way, so putting things in it would make them appear in the stash. That was the exploit
---
Yeah pa and melee(besides unarmed) works well.
---
You can dip into heavy for sqb fights of course.
---
You'll probably want a side build for that specifically. Go 2h all the time, save ammo and go heavy on sqb.
---
The ammo isn't too bad if it's not your main source of damage all the time
---
Little late but are you on rn?
---
Please sticky these you mods!
---
Absolutely this. It should be two categories. Armour is anything that offers any tangible benefits to a player including DMG/Energy Resist, S.P.E.C.I.A.L boosts, legendary affects. Clothing/Apparel is anything purely cosmetic.
---
However this seems like a silly reason to implement it. Just sort by Weight.
---
Freaking ants. Hate those things.
---
Yea with all games it happens thats why people exploit, when I played madden ultimate team, the biggest market was selling the currency online for real world money
---
I climbed the wall to get to the top of the tower, so I am glad that wasn't the course.
---
Where is the course?
---
That's what your mom said when she first saw your face.
---
I think that would have to require a quest of its own as the mega sloth is an OP pet, ranged attack, tanky, AOE attack, and high melee damage.
---
cant wait when online games become stream only. cheaters out of business lol.
---
I'm gonna handle all junk with a massive rework. But yes there are concrete deposits too, good point.
---
If it was a primary it would actually need a buff of some kind. I mean, +10% while aiming compared to +25% from ts or +30% from the faction/species specific ones? Or what about vs furious, junkie's, even mutant's? Mutant's is one of the worst primary effects and that's also 10%
---
I mean I could’ve flipped it for 30k, got an offer for it but why would I haha
---
No, thing on sale are still in your stash. Stash food still degrades, just a lot more slowly.
---
I sell most at or below list value. Drink recipies at 200ish, and anything rare or ni longer available (fasnacht plans) are closer to 800. Nuke cards i sell at 2-500 depending on my mood. (People seem to buy them just as fast at both prices)
---
And they need to release the suspended players who didn't dupe.
---
So I found fossils. But it still didn’t count on my list. Do I need any other one?
---
To add to the town vibe, traders and merchants.. What about the tradesmen of the settlement?! Imagine having a list of roles like ammosmith, blacksmith, PA electrician, hunter, miner, barkeeper/brewer, et al.. players can assign to a role once per 24hrs (could be radiant quest on the pip boy) to make things from the communal resources for the settlement members to utilise! Also maybe even hold elections for an overseer to assign tasks.
---
Check out [this map](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn1xll/thank_you_mappalacia_a_story_of_my_happiness_and/en1rh76/) by u/wickedychickady, then.
---
Lol, I honestly dont get it. I guess though, anyway to make a buck. Never thought I'd see the day people spend hard earned money on a game. But I'm guilty to, I am guilty of buying a few atoms. Never weapons though. Lol
---
I can sell you some plastic if you’re on Xbox
---
YES. I swear it is so hard to get a weapon, because every single weapon costs way too much. Dupers ruined the economy.
---
Amazing write up but I don't understand why people who own the game don't just install it and check it out. Read the online patch notes, see where to go, explore. There is no cost to them, just a little bit of time but I resign, I'm questioning about people asking questions.
---
Now the mods only have to pin this to the top. Thank you for this write-up. I'll handle it for some friends I'm trying to convince to play!
---
Unfortunate, I'm on pc
---
I'm sure we'll run into each other. I added you.
---
North West near Tyler county fairgrounds. Leader of the pack event 😁
---
Most of the weapons I buy from other players are collectables, 90% of the weapons I use are self looted.
---
I simply find comfort in having lots of caps, and knowing I can buy something if I want without worrying about if I can afford it or not.
---
It also tends to fuck over the in-game economy. Didn't matter back when all you had was subreddits and the like, but now that there are in game shops, it's going to have some side effects.
---
lol same here - haven't checked out the Pioneer Scouts yet. Heck I think I'm acquiring legendaries faster than I can scrap them in the legendary machine.
---
hehe it sounds like the simpsons or kurt vonneget
---
Nope.  So the download could just be a scan of the account?
---
Free range might have wolves as well.
---
Yes, but you have to collect them before activating the BOS quest line.  Store in your stash, and take out 1 at a time.  Still got 50 I'm working my way through.  I have all the BOS paints now doing this.
---
Good luck! I don't play on PS4 unfortunately. I would love a silent companion to roam the waste lands with even though I'm low level lol.
---
holy shit that's awesome XD
---
Use trouble shooter armour set instead of pa, sheep has 100% armour penetrations but dmg reduction from trouble shooter works.
---
He did, and he's been creating custom maps for people all day!
---
The servers are already so damn slow because they insist on tracking each piece of junk individually. The game already uses something similar, and it is the least efficient way to function. I assume if IDing each item wouldn’t completely freeze the system they would’ve done it already. 
---
A lot of the issues we face, SBQ and items blipping from existence for example, is already because Beth can’t figure out how a stack works and all four hundred screws are individually instanced even though they’re in my goddamn stash.
---
If that happens what will doc disrespect do?! 🤣
---
Thanks, was kinda surprised how good it looked :D
---
I very much agree! I'm saving this post for that exact reason haha.
---
The higher damage ones have drawbacks. Two shot weapons are mostly hot garbage because of accuracy and stability going to hell along with faster degradation. +10% damage while aiming is a secondary affect. Faction specific are just that, faction specific only. Explosive weapons give your weapon 20% free damage that can be raised further with demo expert. It would be fine
---
What’s duping?
---
Do it on low level robots. They are easy to kill.
---
Oh you’ll find them. Just look for camps!
---
Blackwater mine gets wolves as one of the random spawns just down the mine shaft from the entrance (other spawn is mole rats).
---
Xbox. Shadyrebob.  I have weapons, armor, plans, and aid items. A little bit of everything else too.
---
Unfortunately re-named items still show as the default name to other players. Only you can see the changed name :(
---
Came here to bring up that exact GTAO example. It doesn't even have to be direct gambling with real money to get a lot of flak legally, any in-game gambling at all (New Vegas, FO4) doesn't mix with any sort of real money to in-game money micro-transactions (GTAO, FO76).
---
I had to re-post the map because I'm a dunderhead. It's [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn2w5o/thank_you_mappalachia_here_is_my_random_encounter/).
---
Beth hasn’t said specifically other than they took down the servers to fix an exploit. Being as there was a rash of new legacy weapons that hit the market on console, my guess is that’s what it was...
---
Dipshit
---
Yep, lemme stash my junk and we can do that.
---
100% armor pen? That seems a bit much, I'll have to look into that. I have been using the magazines for 25% reduced robot damage. Using a second set of armor instead would be easier and more effective. Thanks.
---
Quit ur bitching
---
Also mutants could probably use a buff sure and while furious and anti armor are strong that would stop explosive from being strong still. Maybe a small buff but 20% free damage plus aoe damage(the point of the affect) it would have its trade offs like everything else. Not two shot. Two shot is too shit.
---
And this conjecture is something you take delight in and want to share? This post shits itself
---
Don't buy duped items.
---
The game isn’t being rebuilt Bethesda is just to lazy to do single code incorporation basically instead of updating by downloading single lines of code they take the whole game and edit its ordinal code so you are re downloading the original game minus a few things here and there because they may have condensed it a little bit.
---
Hell yes!
---
Honestly just release a standalone Caravan app. I'd play that shit all day.
---
Might explain why the servers have been crashing a lot over the last week.  I got booted three times this morning in about 90 minutes of play
---
I have the same question
---
Ebay and other places... there's a 3 Star TSE Gatling Laser for sale for $125... crazy yes but there are tons of stuff like this being sold outside the game down to bulk junk and aid items for cash.
---
Ugh don't remind me. I didn't know in beta and had about 60 of them convert to one quest item.
---
This didn’t age well.
---
Can I have this link too? Lol
---
the issue is that if you play pvp, you have to use the same weapons as dupers or you cant compete, its an endless cycle.
---
but yeah if you dont pvp but you still use weapons you suspect were duped thats just sad.
---
The Mire cause it's creepy/out of the way - lots of interesting things to see. Only downside - Anglers spawn near my house :| they like to eat my pets
---
This should get you started

[Fallout 76 Build with 15/1/4/6/14/3/7](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#Aw4AAwUNAgYBAQEAKCMDOwPQAQKYAQPgAQGZAQMRAegBA9IBAQsDWQHXAQElA3AFcQPqAQM1A/ABA8oBA3IBAA==)
---
This needs to be pinned!
---
I have only used my alt characters to sell to vendors a few times, my vendor Characters are to heavy to travel, and the others are simply for Caps &amp; Collectables storage.
---
The real Cap stash in this game is in farming Plans and Legendary Gear, and selling to other players at reasonable prices so they keep coming back for more.
---
budget also increases with your level, though I'm not sure if it increases past lv 50 or not... I made the mistake of keeping my camp in the same spot since LV 10 and kept wondering why my budget did not increase as I leveled up - turned out that you need to re-place your camp before you get the additional budget. 
---
They may have patched this since though - this was back in Feb or March maybe...
---
&gt; It's a little late to start quibbling over the definition of "reasonable," especially since it's the metric you yourself set. 
---
I prompted you to elaborate on WHY that would be a reasonable expectation, as I explained why I felt it wasn't.
---
&gt; And since the rest of your post is largely whataboutism and red herrings,
---
Your argument implies that the industry standard is a game not having bugs or exploits. I explicitly pointed out that isn't the case. It's a direct response to your points, not a tu quoque fallacy.
---
&gt;I guess we're done here. 
---
Sure, I guess. Take your ball and go home.
---
No, I wouldn't do any height calculations. I was going to trace all the roads, and connect POIs to make a network of vector paths. Then just measure the vectors and give an approximation of distance. It wouldn't be super accurate, but it'd give an idea of efficiency.
---
Hm ok
---
Those only appear for you btw lol
---
Is it confirmed that other players can see the names you set for items? I would love to name any legendary equipment I sell - it would kind of be like trading a pokemon and giving it a special nickname.
---
Again, then make it possible to acquire some of these items playing!  That’s why people dupe.  That’s why players dupe or buy duped shit.  It’s really not that complicated.  Unless you are one lucky bastard you are not getting that sentinel marine armor through a drop.  Not to say you can’t but it’s like powerball like odds.
---
There's a challenge to collect them all, IIRC there are 8 in total (but only 1 or 2 worth playing)
---
I’m only stating what they said in their patch notes months ago.
---
Ha! Same! Feels like a giant garage sale...lol
---
That seems very isolated and specific so I'm leaning towards a file being corrupted. I'm not familiar with xbox installation but are you able to run a file check on the install?
---
Yeah the black books model for bookshops (or any shop really) seems like it should work but really it doesn't. People just keep trying to buy stuff and keep giving me money i just wanted a musty room to die in but now i need to order stock and everything.
---
I'm sure I've bought a duped item.
---
I can barely play 3 hours a week due to time constraints so it's impossible for me to grind hard enough to get anything good.
---
Let alone.....make enough ammo yo play. As that takes a full week to accomplish.
---
I didnt buy my gun with cash but I'm sure its duped. After the weeks of grinding enough caps to buy it I would be bombed if it just dissapeared.
---
Not very. I thought this with each update. "Oh man, so many people are going to be going through the burrows, there wont be anything left for me." I was the only one there.  
---
Same with Ever Upwards. Expected a bunch of people. Saw may be two.
---
No, there doesn't.
---
Ack! Too much text!
---
Hmm, I wonder if there's someone who can help. I wish I were more tech savvy this way. 
---
Still though, fantastic work.
---
Bashing counts for "melt"?  TY for the tip!
---
I’ll gladly buy duped items as the prices get back to normal. It was insane seeing things go for 100k+.
---
I know sounds cliche but it will work, eventually!
---
Yea, that's what the other people was saying. Still don't see why people would actually pay for stuff like that. But I guess if ya got it go ahead more power to ya. 🤯🤷🏻‍♂️
---
People can’t see the names you give your weapons.
---
You guys aren't listening - OP is 100%
---
Nope, she was didn't come to my birth, neither did my father
---
Check the creator out next to the freak show, whenever you see a Sloth, you will find wolves, also at the place above huntervill, there is a green roof area and cabin both can spawn wolves. They creator with enough server hops, I guarantee you will find wolves. I will pm you a video.
---
This legit sounds like circa 2001 N64 glitches. How does anyone figure those ridiculous sequences out? Then pinpoint WHICH thing was valid?
---
fuck,  I probably look like a fool with level 1 weapons priced at 25000 caps....
---
I assumed everyone could see the names...
---
Go to the archery range at the buddist temple. There's a crossbow there at like 10%
---
Yes, straight west
---
d'oh!  Too bad you are on PS4 otherwise I'd add you so I could check out your shop.
---
I believe so
---
How the hell would any of us know you’re dyslexic..? Most people that make these posts are just lazy or don’t know to look at the patch notes. I’m sorry you weren’t one of them but there’s clearly no reason I could know. To answer your question it is the only event. 2 repeatable dailies also
---
I don't know if it was intentional as they gave him negative 30% penetrations but even one percent negative will be interpreted by the game as 100% positive
---
You on Xbox selling one of those?🤑
---
Only you yea, its to avoid slurs and all the dumb names you know people would put lmaoo, also to avoid people false naming legendaries to trick others
---
If this isn't in the atom shop tomorrow with commission going to the artist I say we all bunker up in the mire and over throw Bethesda
---
You mean like opening the workbench in a recent patch, and checking the basic repair functionality to see that item CND bars weren't showing if you repaired an item? After they specifically changed the repair UI? And the fact that that same patch made it so when you logged in, your gun's magazine was empty even if it was full when you logged off?
---
god forbid they check some of their game's most basic features in their QA for a patch, because a bug literally found by logging in to the game doesn't really fit that excuse
---
Destroying the economy, making pvp players have  several sets of godlike sets of gear just to name a few ways
---
You are paying 1 way or another with your time or your cash. Some people have for cash then time
---
I'm not aware of anything like that. I just checked under the manage game options in the dashboard and didn't find a option like that. I really hope I dont have to reinstall.
---
Give it time.
---
For ranged weapons, you have a 0.00156848 percent chance to get the 3 star item you’re looking for, if you roll 3 star ranged weapons.
---
Far from 20 percent my dude.
---
If you could actually choose the weapon that rolls, it would be a 0.06 percent chance to get the item you want, which would be mythic rare by mmo standards.... but you can’t.
---
You might get the ideal item by next year, or next decade.
---
I am a possum I’ve gotten 2 possum badges in 7 completions. God awful drop rate but I get it. At least you can get them🤷🏻‍♂️
---
That can also be an issue with your internet btw
---
The broken chain idea was awesome
---
Are you looking for the regular plans or upgrade plans and mods?
---
Do you have any notes on the encounters themselves? I would love to get them split up into the 4 categories so people can see what has a chance to spawn at what encounter. I can get you a list of all of them if it helps decipher this.
---
That blackberry line was so interesting! Very abrupt.
---
There--  
---
There's a PLASMA FLAMER??
---
Those are xo1 bracers the ultracite version only says ultracite optimized bracers plan
---
Duplication glitch I believe?
---
The plans please and thank you.  I’m dying over here on Roboticist and I will pay premium right now for them cause it’s annoying and can’t find them!  😭
---
Yes, I wouldnt disagree, perhaps on occassion, but I have a good reliable connection.
---
Hahaha I do that in other games too
---
I feel your pain, and am determined to board them like mad once I get around to playing my low level alt more.
---
I’ve been there but found the basement for the first time today.
---
Nope 👎
---
what in the world does that even mean? I get that being needlessly confrontational on the internet is cool and all, but honestly? 
---
for the record I wasn't walking down the street with a sandwich board sign advocating for people to play 76, I had discussions with my actual friends who had only heard the negative things and tried to explain to them that it was actually a pretty fun game.
---
Duping is the process of exploiting the game's glitches to spawn an insane amount of items for yourself. So basically duping=duplicating
---
I can see paying a few dollars for something you really wanted and just couldn't get it dropped to you maybe spending like $5-$10 bucks max but you see sets of armor on there for $100-$200 and they're selling... I don't get it... 
---
I love the game but not gonna spend that kinda cash...lol
---
We did it in Wavy Willards. There is even a spot of water in the wave area that wasn't getting rads. Took off armor and let a low level scorched kill the person. We were there to take pictures of the rides anyway.
---
Not to be mean as things online can seem that way, but how much wood are you using? I put on Woodchuck, click logs, and can get a few hundred just wandering around in a couple minutes.
---
...and what are you using it for? Is there some super neat wood thing I need to know about lol
---
Ha ha, you need a mod or plans for somthing called a Plasma Thrower. it chews through ammo but its much better than the Flamer and burns a green flame instead.
---
You have that right to do so friend. It encourages them to keep doing what they are doing in my eyes. You are just adding to the problem. You like lagging while fighting a queen or running thru WS? That's cool, I'd rather not though. Just pisses me off tbh
---
I have also seen this, its a sheepsquatch random encounter. When you find him there should be other dead super mutants near by and upon approach you should hear the roar of a sheepsquatch in the distance.
---
not at all friend. i have a few friends that mostly play to build cool and unique camps. nobody ever came to visit in the past so they got bored and stopped playing after a few months. after they saw me playing and how people were coming to my camp non stop, they logged back in and fired up a vending machine and the visitors started pouring in. now they're excited for the new interactive gameplay fallout 76 is now offering.
---
Come to think of it, my camp has had a lot more visits by cave crickets since this update.
---
Yes, this.  Not to mention it would help us tell how much the 10% fee was.
---
You should at least pop Grape Mentats. The price difference is noticeable and they're basically a free upgrade from normal Mentats (2 Mutfruit, 1 Whiskey, chance to double result with Super Duper).
---
Don’t downvote this guy, he’s just asking a question
---
Stay away from workshops unless you’re completely out of fusion cores.
---
There’s a better way to gather anything you would set up a workshop for.
---
Lmfao love that guy
---
Ikr! I work hard for my money. Not gonna drop it on armor set or duped gun that some 13yr old boy made in his moms basement with lil Billy from down the street. Lol
---
Luckily it was only for stackable items so no legendaries... Right?
---
,L
---
L0
---
/,,,P
---
Oh hasn’t that been in the game since launch?
---
That's absolutely duping and bug abuse on that persons side; there is no way that you can sell that many aid items in a stash let alone everything else. Perks for weight reduction do not benefit your stash so there is no way come hell or high water that this is legit.
---
Well since West Virginia is in the US the driver side is the same no matter what country your from.
---
There is definitely something wrong with that picture, I have a former Vendor Character that is overweight with diluted Stimpaks, to the point he can't even be traded with and it's no where near that much.
---
So I’ll try to explain it a little.  But I’m not good with the technical terms so bare with me.  As far as i understood last time this happened For fast needed fixes like exploits(today’s) it’s quicker for them to change the issue on a copy and let us Do the large download.  It takes time to fix the issues in smaller compartments which is what they do with the patches when they have time to prepare and roll them out smoothly.  So infact today we did download and replace our game file.
---
Just go to recently played with from the main menu and you can rejoin the same server. All people recently played with will be from the last server played
---
This is so strange to me for this game, FALLOUT 76 IMO is not even about being good or beating anyone! There’s no point to it. I mean are they trying to buy the neon letter plans or something? To me that’s the real endgame. :^
---
I love this idea! But only if they don’t move their cursor. I’ve spent a few minutes thinking of what to buy. So if it’s just an auto 60 second timer this could effect me and others that take a while to choose what we want.
---
Guard your ankles
---
Water Purifiers + Can Do + Butcher's Bounty for items, Hard Bargain + Beer + Grape Mentats before selling them. Cleans out my 1400 vendor caps easily.
---
Yes and no, there has been ways to dupe but they have been patched out but people keep on finding new methods apparently
---
I haven't played the game in like 4 months. There has been some major changes since then so I don't know.
---
I will check this out!  Thank you
---
Sucks that clothing no longer has stat bonuses like in Fallout 4. I get they wanted to have more freedom to wear what you want, but eh. i like stats.
---
And the game can still run normally through that process?  I'm on a ps4 by the way.  Sorry for my confusion.  This game has been particularly weird as it is and I just want to make sure I don't have to keep an eye out for randomly large updates as well.
---
Do multiple Unyielding pieces stack the additions? This changes the game.
---
They better not. My Deathclaw/Cat topiary duo is a center piece at my place.
---
No problem, it’s no excuse for Bethesda not having a rejoin server option, but it is a viable workaround in most cases
---
This comes off as a bit entitled so soon. Anyone joining the game now has much better access to materials then those of us who came before. 
---
Maybe message them? Try farming the Watoga High School cafeteria if its plastic you're after.
---
I bought extra atoms in the xbox store early on not knowing you could earn them...lol
---
the item itself looks like a chip, and you are scrapping legendary gear to get them.. so i used that reasoning for the name
---
It's going to come down to how high your requirements are. If you only need a small advancement on a particular set of items,ie wanting a furious melee weapon with swing speed, or an armor piece with ammo weight reduction, then the probability you'll find something acceptable. A Vampire machete with seing speed? Yeah  that'll do as well.
---
I only need the damn thing for this bs tadpoles badge and hell im about to give up on it.
---
 Its stupid that i cant use photomode to take pictures of the damn rides.
---
Marine Tactical Helmet. Most OP recipe in the game for profits.
---
Dunno but you can get them in the watchtower north of the pumpkin house
---
I found one at solomon's pond in the shack.
---
I don’t see why they wouldn’t be. I think the issue is all of the newly added random encounters are lowering the chances you’ll get the one you are after.
---
The witch and skelly can also spawn at the spot near Treetops, so you can try cycling between the two.
---
I love it I think it’s a good start of making a nice settlement with folks
---
On Xbox there’s been a large influx of TSE laser rifles🤨
---
On ps4.   There doesnt seem to be this option.  Hmm
---
That's actually a good idea cause I've had this problem plenty of times
---
I like teaming up. I just teamed up with a guy to do the revive. We had some problems with the game, but he was a great guy and he helped me out a ton. I gave him some meds, but I had to go after we got it. 
---
I would seriously recommend finding someone on Reddit. It’s easy, and I’d imagine most people are nice.
---
You learn the recipe to craft one after... scrapping junk? I don't know specifically how the recipe is learned, but I just learned it after scrapping a bunch of junk. The Assaultron Circuit Board you need to craft one is a rare-ish drop from Assaultrons, head over to Watoga or someplace and get to work.
---
If you're on PC I'm selling a couple at my vendor's stand. In-game name is Hoon.
---
Yea, you are right its their choice. Just hate running around during queen fights or at WS like I'm suffering from involuntary speech repetition. Studder steppin every 3 feet. Because some guy is busy making aae handmades for lil Tommy an Billy to spend their lunch money on.
---
Sweet. Thanks!!
---
It only works directly after being disconnected to main menu
---
New features = new attack surfaces for exploiters. Someone found a new bug.
---
Oh ok
---
There's literally 3 kinds there... the ones I mentioned, Hydraulic bracers and Tesla Bracers
---
Here is same vendor for one of them:
---
https://imgur.com/cGI2sZx
---
Yeah, really sucks if you need to use the vendor before doing a run and you have limited time to play the game.
---
After a direct DC to main menu, go to Social-&gt; recently played with. I play on PS4 too, have done it on multiple occasions
---
Just some extra info the event only appears at night around 8 to 10 pm so check the pip boy if it does not appear
---
It then comes down to intelligent sorting etc. For any given specific legendary item they are really pretty rare. If you factor in generating date etc there’s not a whole lot to compare to. Say my bloodied explosive pump was generated mid December, its serial could be as simple as BEPS181215001, how many bloodied pumps were dropped that day? i doubt it would be in the hundreds. This process if implemented properly shouldn’t take too much CPU time at all. Mind you this is for legendary items only, probably even for 2 or more star items. Yes they still have the issue with instanced junk items and bullets but that too can be optimized.
---
yup, got my bage today
---
One does not simply get rid of a duplicated item.
---
This is awesome.  Thanks again
---
You sure it wasn’t Super Duper?
---
I put that and the Deathclaw one up last night thinking Bethesda gifted them to players.
---
Hi have been hunting everywhere for the conduit plan are you selling one or no anyone that has it
---
I used to farm that spot for the costumes/plans, still do, the trick-o-treaters npcs' still spawn but not like they used to, very rare. If you need costumes, I can make them for you PC/XB1.
---
This should be stickied.
---
All plans are now in the production area of the bunker for X-01 to include new X-01 Military Paint Plan
---
If I go to McDonald's and there's no ketchup because five minutes ago some guy took his soda cup and filled it to the brim with ketchup to take home, then as I'm sitting there eating my dry fries I'm not going to blame McDonald's for not having a security camera and an armed guard on their condiment counter. I'm going to blame the asshole walking around with a 32 ounce plastic cup of ketchup.
---
Just because you can be a dick doesn't mean you should be a dick, and it doesn't mean that other people won't accurately call you a dick when you act like one.
---
Not you personally, of course. You're not a duper.
---
I have played since Beta.  I have 9 characters on 2 accounts. Levels 100s, 90s, two in the 60s, 3 in the 50s, 9ne in the 30s and one at 9.   All themed and just to build different houses...I STILL HAVENT BOUGHT NEON SIGNS BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE GAME IS OVER!
---
Semi-related; Bashing a yao guai to death with the syringer counts for that hunter challenge.
---
He is awesome! Use to watch him all the time. Love when goes tf off on people or a game. I am in tears laughing. Dudes a nut. 😂
---
Dupers are the true Raiders
---
Fire weapons as a whole need some serious reworking. Flamer ammo costs too much, and the shishkebab is too weak, and doesn't even do burning damage. None of the flaming mods or legendaries with burning effects work with the one and only perk geared towards fire damage which is Friendly Fire.
---
Thanks for the responses. Guess I'll just keep at it. Maybe they'll make the process more transparent at some point.
---
this is what we need in game    great job
---
IMO the flamer should work like fusion cores, 100 fuel per Canister, there can be a mod for a double fuel injector, and a triple fuel injector that loads 2 or 3 canisters in at a time
---
I replied to wrong comment, I'm checking now...
---
Restart your game if it's still there drop it or give it to someone where you dont have multiple of the same items on your account that's what they look for.
---
None of those perks work on your stash though, only on what you're holding.
---
TLDR the title
---
While I agree... it's also fittingly "So Russian", which is where the ballistic knife (according to the Wiki) was initially created in the '70s.
---
In related news, I just read yesterday that apparently the **missiles** on US drones [now have the option to pack a shite-load of.... yep... spring-loaded knife blades](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/dod-cia-developed-flying-ginsu-missile-to-take-out-single-targets/) *(instead of an explosive payload)*, to "minimize collateral damage", and it has been used successfully in strikes against terrorist group leaders. 
---
Though the wording in the article seems a little misleading as it --at least to me-- implies the blades possess the capability to penetrate concrete walls and to me that seems counter-intuitive of limiting collateral damage; however, after getting to the end of the article it seems more likely that it's the Hellfire Missile itself that possesses this penetrating capacity, *not* the payload. Reason I suspect this is because the end of the article seemingly implies that all of the payload was contained inside the vehicle the missile 'detonated' in. The bulk of a car is made up of the "sheet metal" the article mentions the knives being able to penetrate through... So yea *\shrug*\ heh 
---
*\cough*\ Bethesda *^(not that you'd be reading this particular thread)^*... maybe 76's Missile Launcher should also get a similar "shrapnel" capability which converts the missile from 'explosive' to 'ballistic' damage ;)
---
Mascot does, not imposter.
---
I’ve been unable to find them either. Nor the Fujiama scientist. I’ve hopped for long periods, as well. They seemed to have vanished around the time they nerfed the value of the costume
---
Also, do NOT use weapon artisan when repairing.  Just repair it to exactly 100%, bash 5 or 6 enemies, then repair.  rinse repeat
---
I paid 5300, 5000, 4500 and 3500 for my imposter outfits.
---
Hahaha, why thank you!!!
---
Yea, I didn't craft it
---
I actually leave the public area doors open and would rather if they left it open. I have turrets right outside the door and the mobs are generally low level so I'm not stressed of an intruder.
---
That's what really threw me off, at first it seemed pretty reliable. Now... not so much.
---
Yeah but the dupe they just patch was buying it out of multiple terminals at the same time. It seems to me (and im not an expert by any means) that those interactions with the terminals would not be what is cause lag issues. And it seems to me that they might use that as an excuse to cover up their problems with their mechanics
---
Restarted, going to recheck
---
damn.. for you dont know.
---
Imposter too, ive already bought two sets for even less, and ive been selling them for 500 each part at my vending. Check the market sub
---
given that's going to be a stash carry weight of 24,000lbs, no - there's nothing legitimate going on there.
---
A shower? What's this witchcraft you speak of?
---
I think that they added cameras as random container loot now. I have about 10 broken prosnap cameras. Not sure if that'll start the quest though
---
The bush things was an accident damn
---
Atleast you tried
---
Damn I saw him and thought he was just a normal injured mutant and killed him. Now I realize what I missed
---
Raiders398-PS4: Serums priced to move, a few faschnat plans, recipes, and masks left, other random high quality crap to fill your stash box. Main is just to the east of the top of the world on the acid node. Alt is just east of Gauley Mine.
---
Lol. Maybe I should stop sneaking and give the poor thing a heads up?
---
And my first set ever I got for 1.5k back when it first came out
---
Isn’t it the silo hatch in the land between site alpha and sugar cove?
---
Lol, it happens! But hopefully you know now. I like farming legendary stuff. You have to do quest and achievements to get atoms. I'll just be playing kill a ghoul and one will pop up. Like; kill 1000 ghouls. 10 atoms.... like really?! 10 atoms?! Lmao! But I have fun doing it. All that matters.
---
Not that big. You can come look if you like
---
Your buddy selling milk? &gt;.&gt;
---
I’d love some more gas mask variants, maybe a brown or black hood to go with the green, and would absolutely love some Underarmor with hanging cloth, like a trench coat that can go under the armor pieces
---
Also, are you looking for any legendary robot armor?
---
I get the whole wanting to dupe weapons and armor but the mask to me personally is kindve different. It was at one point a sense of pride having something cosmetically exclusive like that from the event but we were gonna get more chances to get them or different ones down the road. Also Bethesda might’ve done that on purpose to kindve track these super exclusive items when duping made a bit of a comeback so they could narrow things down a bit? Anyways, let there be rare items like this it’s a mask not some weapon that lets you one shot everyone it’s just a cosmetic and I thought it was cool with few having them.
---
I gun bash 'em and brace for PVP. No takers yet.
---
Restarted, they are gone.
---
I actually enjoy the atom shop theme because it's chill and kind of reminds me of sims lmao
---
Lol this is so wholesome, I really hope you don’t get banned.
---
I am 95% sure they are under advanced power connectors. I believe the bot in harpers ferry has them if not watoga. They always have all the plans now so it won't take long to find them.
---
"All competitively priced."  Sales pitch as an aside in the larger post.  I love it.  Gamertag?
---
I've been there also but was never aware of the basement until your comment, thanks :P
---
I've never heard someone say "man this game runs real smooth, dont it?!" Lmao! Anything is possible I guess. They f'd up and making it seem that way is very possible. I agree with that.
---
there is. you can tag stuff from the cooking menu/anywhere that requires those food items
---
That would not make any sense, thought it was kinda put in there as an alternative to ws and wes tec. But it could be "just bethesda things..."
---
That being said i went on wed and got goose egged for legendaries when
---
I generally will get at least 1 2-3 star and some 1 stars.
---
Well, it is their fault for...
---
A) Not testing adequately.
---
B) Putting not very experienced people in charge of whole implementations (it's really obvious, and quite hilarious sometimes)  
---
C) Limiting possibilities of modding  
---
D) Trying to control the pace of the game  
---
E) Tracking everything  
---
It's kind of like when a big corporation hires from India to create a transactional webite and you can edit the cart price in the page to 1 dollar and then checkout 1000$ of stuff for 1 dollar. They sure saved on the programming the second a doofus sent out the products anyways!
---
Duping never stopped. The method that was blown up got patched but there were a couple methods that still worked and have been kept on the hush hush. But this new one involved having a character in a 'corrupt' state and a player vending machine. Don't know the specifics.
---
This was when we needed the fast travel mats to return. 
---
I'd like people to spawn on a bridge that the upper level of my house connects onto (and on whose roof the vending machines are located.) Instead people spawn on the ground under the bridge and have to run through my house to find the machines. I don't really want to fill my house with vault boys pointing the way as i've already got the lit arrows on my upper walls where the people are expected to come from.
---
These threads have been here since the launch. It's both sides' fault: dupers' and Bethesda's. It's kinda obvious I think.
---
Don't sell yourself short! Just keep playing with it, trying new things and looking to other players' camps for inspiration. :)
---
I watch a lot of YouTube tutorials nowadays when I get stuck with a build.
---
And old man winter masks...
---
I gotta admit they got me there. I thought it was a greeting lol
---
I have it in my stash (XB1)
---
I have heard that deathclaw hides don't drop off deathclaws but are a rare world drop...
---
That's exactly what I was thinking! I've got a ton more but didn't want to overdue it lol
---
Ugh, that's disgusting, duping? online? Where do you even find those? I mean there are so many definitions of the term duping, how would you even do it correctly? What are the exact steps that would match the term you used?
---
I'll give this a shot thanks!
---
**TL;DR:** Don't hate the game, hate the player.
---
Great job, thanks.
---
Hmm looks like I spent the last 1.5 hrs doing this possum challenge for nothing. Thanks for the info.
---
Right! Sum beaches! 😂
---
It really is isn't it? I got a peak inside while the owner around and there was some sort of alter inside. 
---
I regret not getting a pic
---
Rule 7,no fucking rumors. Either go through the files like the person that proved Watoga robots had been set to not spawn legendaries and provide proof or shove it up your ***. 
---
Every single fucking patch.
---
I found one in a container outside the tattoo parlour
---
Thats dissapointing, hope it's not battle royale battle royale, I wanted something more along the lines of 12v12
---
id rather not rebuild my camp.. so ima stay where i am and offer free acid at my camp
---
Meh, it doesn't bother me. I don't often trade and if they want to play the game that was I couldn't care less.
---
One time I even duped myself. I dropped some junk while my friend was playing, logged off, logged back in as my junk mule, and saw my main was still standing there. It was such a lol moment as I thought some other player came to pick up my junk. My main just stood there for a good five minutes before it disappeared.
---
Idk. I haven't seen anything about 1.5 yet....  Maybe Todd is fucking with you in particular for some reason.
---
Add PvP to the not want to come back/buy cause they sure ruined that.
---
Unfortunately, the naming on stuff is only visible to the user who renamed it.
---
In other words, anything you name and:   
---
\-trade to a player  
---
\-drop on the ground  
---
\-put in a container for someone else  
---
\-sell to a vendor bot  
---
\-put for sale in your own vendor  
---
...then it will only show up to others with the original name (so in this instance: "Combat Knife").
---
Unfortunately, but necessary to prevent unacceptable misuse, like labeling a Baton as "Bitch Be Good Stick" *(yes, I can think of much worse names, but wasn't willing to type it...)*
---
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news :(
---
You find a "broken prosnap deluxe camera" on certain dead bodies that look like tourists. They spawn at certain "landmark" locations. You can repair the camera and craft film at the tinkerer's workbench.
---
RIP CSGO
---
So like camp McClintock?
---
Yeah, that's a no. I like my location for convenience and since I tend to have several neighbors, I know I'm not the only one.
---
Nice try...
---
Pretty sure with the new update relocating your C.A.M.P. is way easier, but this is just a suggestion. This is purely wasteland merchandising, put the products where theyll be seen the most.
---
My slot machine hand is ready
---
Oh man it's 800 now??? I haven't played since it was 400, that's game changing
---
This is very helpful! Thanks!
---
I play games as a completionist so I like to have all the info so I don't miss out on anything.
---
FYI, I'm not seeing Clancy Manor on your Ballistic Fiber locations
---
Nope, I've seen some amazing camps the last few days. Some guy (or gal) managed to build on the Grafton water tower. Most impressive one I've seen yet.
---
I've heard that so I went there and a folksy midwestern mom-bot greeted me and was very pleasant but no events triggered and I haven't seen any yellow flashing hexagons in that area either so idk. Maybe one day.
---
I put mine next to a frequently farmed location. I don't want to server hop looking for a server that has my spot available so I don't build in the most popular areas.

The dont spawn on deathclaws. Only in containers. I tend to find them in scorchbeast piles.
---
Might be a good idea to check the top of the Watoga building where Mayor for a Day plays out for the Cranberry Meatball Grinder's Scorchbeast Meat. There's a bunch of bone piles there that usually have Scorchbeast bones/meat/organs on them. If that doesn't help, Glass Cavern has several Scorchbeast corpses, though I'm not sure they can be searched for more meat.
---
Make a real low level crossbow...then use it to bash enemies.
---
PC but thanks for the offer. I'll just have to visit the Encryptid event and hope someone bites it in the puddle by the cabin.
---
That’s how it was intended to be
---
If it helps I found the skelly mask at freddies and the skelly suit at flatwoods lookout tower or north kanawha lookout cant remember which.
---
Before I gave up on this shitty game I played about thirty or forty levels over the carry limit. It's kind of annoying but definitely more immersive.
---
I have mine set if you want to use the workshop. Don't need no stank in my house thank you very much. I already stink enough!
---
I wonder if I could server hop watoga and sift through some giant piles of guano and find some. Sounds like a fine way to spend a Friday evening
---
For anyone struggling with the questions the answers are here:

---
Its just a suggestion, and also basic merchandising.
---
You need to calm down, I have not seen as many legendaries as before from the burrows. Dont see what your big problem is.
---
Yep, exactly what I said, (wanted price *10/9).
---
Oh okay, thank you.  I know next to nothing about these things.  I just saw the large download and thought, "Wtf???"
---
Btw- Small letters plan =/= signs and letters plan. Just wanted to save you some caps in case
---
Glad i’m not the only one that felt like this 😂
---
Why do you care? In the entirety of my play throughs in both this game and 4 I never touched a flamer, except for challenges. Incase you think it’s my play style, it’s not I used to play TF2 and I have over 400+ hours as pyro which is 200 off from this game.
---
Sure, because you can just magically know if an item is duped or not. Makes perfect sense.
---
The fact that people think its ok to need multiple characters with maxed out cash to pay for a single item shows one of the many ways this game is utterly broken.  And now that beth has added a sales tax its just going to push costs up even more.
---
Love it. I'd give you a buck for it if the ever get the creation club going.
---
Any idea where to find one?
---
You are a disgrace to the enclave. Giving mutants free roam!
---
How am I supposed to get the neon lights? I am doing a new store in my camp and they would be really useful. I am willing to pay any ammount of caps.
---
Sorry to ask but could nuclear material be on a map please I have been making sets of power armor for players at a lower level and the I'm always missing is nuclear material please and thank you and sorry for the trouble
---
I had this happen with random notes in my stash for awhile
---
I'm on PC, know where to find one?
---
Is this still an in-game issue?  I’ve been away for a few months. Just started again this past week or so.
---
Yeah I have been going multiple times and server hopping and havent seen any, wasn't sure if everyone else is seeing the same issue.
---
Think about it like this. That one guy who played 180 hours looking for that one specific weapon. They literally have it and a simple click/button press. There’s no incentive to keep searching for loot after that. 
---
In fact all your purchased gear had to be farmed from someone. 
---
If we are going to make the that easy by selecting what you want on your weapons and armour. Then BGS might as well cater to every laze pinhead and go ahead add lootboxes and p2w items.
---
I can hate both. The player for duping, and the game for being so poorly made that almost every patch reintroduces duping.
---
Found mine randomly searching, but check most raider vendors
---
Theg really need something like the **Clothing Overhaul** Mod from Fallout 4. This alows you to craft gloves and pretty much every article of clothing. Fallout 4 with mods and Creation Club content is still a far superior game than Fallout 76 due to the lack of content comparison.
---
Scorchqueen is alot easier than the new events.
---
If that's the case, then the areas surrounding WS would be better with robot vendors nearby. 
---
And seriously, lots of us have spent a fair amount of time finding the right place for our camps and with being visible on the map now, it's not a big deal to travel or visit them when you're "in the neighborhood" anyway.
---
I have low charisma :P Thanks for the name.
---
It is not lore friendly.
---
It's why I can't go on survival, it's like everybody but me has TSE autos (and/or mutations or something that causes me to inflict no damage).
---
Here are two pictures, not the best quality, will try to do better.

Yes, it has three heads and two tails.
---
There's a video on YouTube where a guy works out the odds of you getting the three star combination you want. He was over 300k to one when I quit watching.
---
If everyone set their camp near vault76 then I guess everyone will need to server hop a lot of time to find a place to set up their camp
---
Moving the camp device changes the spawn, but it seems a bit inconsistent how it determines where to put you
---
You're the second person to say that, I'll probably check it out tomorrow. Is it definitely still there in this patch?
---
Posted links under the main topic.
---
D:
---
Yh same
---
But. When someone sells I'll gotten goods to a pawn shop they dont charge the owners of said pawn shop with recieving stolen good, just confiscate said goods and charge the culprit. Just a thought
---
Ah ok that makes sense. Hopefully it’s fixed soon. Thanks!
---
Find super rare thing legit. Tries to sell it, "yeah I'll give you a cap for it"
---
That’s the one that finally worked for me. Thanks!
---
Yeah no thanks, I’d rather not do that I’m fine with the location I’m set up at.
---
Just take the game you have now and subtract if it’s smaller they condensed the game.  if it’s larger the difference is the size of the new content. Think about it like this you have grass texture they take that-grass texture and add one letter to it now they send that out with every other texture and code and action in the game and in a way replace the game you had just with one letter extra on the grass. I don’t know how to explain it other than they are replacing the game you already had with a the same version just new content. But that’s not technically what’s happening.
---
It's too meta to even be considered lore friendly lol
---
The dead should have mysterious quills on the bodys too.
---
Awesome!
---
The “xo1 ultracite optimized bracers” selected in the photo are modifications for a xo1 power armor but when you put it on the xo1 set it doesn’t say ultracite optimized bracers, the ultracite power armor has optimized bracers but it is “Ultracite Optimized Bracers” only dropped by sbq loot I believe
---
somebody teach me dupe glitch
---
&gt;You might like this game if:
---
&gt;1) You enjoyed the look and feel of previous Fallout games.
---
I'm struggling to read the rest of this because this is like the opposite of why people like FO76. The biggest complaint I've seen is that it's not like the past Fallouts, just like they said about FO4. Plus you have it as a plus if you like playing alone but a minus if you don't like being lonely.
---
 Before this update finding another player wasn't a common thing, like there were weekly posts complaining about it feeling so much like a single player game because you weren't coming across other players often.
---
Like honestly not trying to be rude but this is basically
---
"If you like MMORPGs and the Fallout series then Fallout the MMORPG is perfect for you."
---
There is a lot of cherry picking in this post trying to ignore the negatives in FO76. Like *a lot* of people have been reporting more crashes after the most recent update. You changed it to "A small percentage". There are still bugs from the beta in game. You changed it to "No game is flawless".
---
Here's a much easier way to determine if FO76 is for you.
---
Is it $30? Do you like MMOs? Does repetitiveness not bother you? Then try FO76.
---
Oh I totally get that. Im not demanding everyone move their camp for my convenience. I just know there are player like me that are making Vending their main focus and I thought this would be a good idea. I personally dont fast travel unless its on the opposite side of the map since I forage alot for meds while I travel.
---
This!!!
---
I have ocd.
---
I used to lock my doors because of it.
---
Left then unlocked with player vending and everyone kept leaving the doors open.
---
I just removed them all.
---
No doors anymore.
---
Say it like a normal person, it’s asshole dumbass
---
Life after the snap
---
If the pawn shop knowingly bought items that are stolen then hell yes they will be charged for a crime...
---
So you can't kill other players legendary spawn anymore, that's because nobody travels there any more.
---
"It was the best of times, it was the blurst of times."
---
This post: the definitive answer is here!
---
The definitive answer: maybe
---
That is hilarious
---
why was this stickied? surely someone who cares about this game knows that you have to get the methods out in order to get them patched.
---
I like my location near Top of the World. It cuts down on MY fast travel costs since the most I have to pay for is one half of the map's worth of caps. I'm also more of an incidental trader, acquiring stuff to sell will never be my main reason for playing.
---
I want god rolls but don't have the gear. Played decently at launch but stopped playing as often when the content dried out (and other games were there to play). I did some grinding and got decent stuff but I've wanted an armor piercing .50 cal for ages and I thought this vendor would be a sure way to get one.
---
 I think the point here is that it still keeps the loot *entirely* randomized except for the weapon type and the number of stars. I can totally see myself having to spend 20k legendary points before an armor piercing .50 cal procs; I'd likely just find one from the grind by then which kinda defeats the purpose of the vendor.
---
Now I want to see a fight between a behemoth and a sheepsquatch.
---
Woah man, far out..free ~~acid~~ daytripper?
---
I didn't know about this but the other day I thought to myself... Man, with these vending machines and drink bowls I bet Beth left a loophole somewhere. Of course fuckwits have to find it and exploit it.
---
Not at this time - junk is not possible because it needs to evaluate every item *containing* nuclear material. This is just my first iteration though, so check back I suppose
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/YE9A8m9
---
This is my first picture I took. I died.
---
Or put down a power armour frame and get in - you'll teleport to where you put it. No worries.
---
No sir, just really need the plans to craft them.
---
Look out for the event called "Leader of the Pack" that spawns north-west from the Vault 76 near Tyler County Fairgrounds.
---
Darn I will check back then and will look forward to it and thanks I guess
---
That's not the same at all.
---
1. McDonalds without a doubt has another 20 gallons of ketchup in the back. All you have to do is ask nicely for some. Or buy your own ketchup and avoid the entire condiment station with the general public's un-washed hands all over it.
---
2. Bethesda and other game publishers of always-online games need to assume responsibility for the integrity of their product. It is inexcusable to release this sort of game with poor / no QA.
---
Oh.... crap. I beat the game then?? :O 
---
But seriously... if you have to dupe to buy those plans, it means you're either impatient, or horrible at this game... Why? Because I bought this plan on my now-level 138 character. I have NEVER sold a single item to another player (prior to the Vendor update) since I don't use the 76 For Sale sub, nor Discord, or even in-game voice chat (limited bandwidth and even then, no mic). 
---
Yet despite that fact, I managed to legitimately purchase the plans for the Neon Letters, nevermind plans for all the building types, and a bunch more things. This is on top of the fact that I give away so much excess junk and legendaries to other players *(find stuff in the colored suitcases at train stations or the overseer's stash in Flatwoods? might've been me!)*, as well as scrap every piece of armor I find to learn mods. "Somehow" I've still managed to accumulate more than enough caps in order to enjoy the game. Hell, I even gave 5000 caps to my friend a few days ago so that she could buy some stuff!
---
Want to dupe an awesome item you got to give your friend? Ya know, I'm actually OK with that.  
---
Want to dupe something over-and-over to make a shitload of caps? Then FO76 clearly isn't the game for you. FO3, NV, 4 with their console commands might be more your speed. Hit \~ and type in player.additem cap 10000000000 *^(('cap' isn't actually what you type, I'm just too lazy to go find the ItemID lol))*
---
I had an accidental duping the day just before the update. Idk if that specific thing could be exploitable, but it did happen and it was before the update. So the truth is that under the hood something has never been right. (I've reported the specific incident to Bethesda devs and no place else.)
---
Im not saying everyone. Im just saying those that are focusing 100% on vending. There are also plenty of spaces around vault 76. I dont mean right next  the vault either. Like a 2 mile radius around it.
---
I am glad I'm on the only one. Do you also enter workshop mode at your camp, even though you are at Max budget 🤣
---
Lol, it kind of seems like he's fucking with everyone who plays this game.
---
gonna check it, dont remember it.
---
Good to know I can literally cheat/glitch the game and not have to worry about a permanent ban. 
---
For real though, they need to take some notes on how Overwatch or Rainbow Six handles their cheaters. Or go even more strict sense it's technically a live game and these sorts of things have repercussions outside of a single match.
---
'Log' stay!
---
I got 10x for 30 caps each yesterday, it was wild. Also like 10 Fasnacht masks for 10 caps each, stupid stupid low price.
---
what did you buy and at what cost?
---
I wish the alien blaster was on this list. It might be crap but a 3 star would justify me using it. As it stands it's just waiting in my stash to be displayed when we can do that.
---
‘Log’ pick that up!
---
You can join my game.
---
Ive had sneak 3 for a long time, and as long as you sit still/move slowly, Ive found that enemies can be smelling your breath and not realise your there.
---
Honestly I kind of assumed it was a bug at first as it seemed silly to me, but Ive killed several sheepsquatch without ever leaving Caution.
---
Sneak 3 is 100% worth having imo for stealth builds
---
Yeah, it's been there since beta. Works the same way the junk tagging works.
---
I know... but I built inside of an existing structure so there isnt room too. 😫
---
Nice!
---
He's an angry internet nerd. He has that nerd rage. Likes to scream and act like he has any authority while simultaneously contributing fucking nil to the effort.
---
Ignore him.
---
Yeah wow, I’m pretty shocked by the amount of downvotes I got for saying that. My understanding is that there’s no way to know what’s duped and what isn’t, and now with the new trading it could be easy to quickly pawn off duped stuff to unsuspecting players.
---
Really dude? 🙄
---
Ones I've met have been rather generous, but I definitely don't approve of anyone selling the loot for real money, or using methods that distabalise a whole server!
---
They were also rebanned days later. They had a mass unbanning and then rebanned all those people.
---
I got a furious Flamer it's fun until it last few sec and kill 2 ennemies...   Same for plasma flamer i remember had 300 Cartridges though it was a lot well it was 5 minutes fun of Surface to air event then empty...
---
It's Kotaku. Fuck, of course they're making a big deal about it. It's like all these places have mysteriously never played an online game.
---
I haven’t, I just genuinely assumed that there’s no indication if an item is duped or not.
---
you still have the wing?
---
I think it is, but isn't that just a closed hatch? The challenge says inside, as though you have to do a nuke run but the nearest silo is alpha. I've never heard of a silo being in sugar cove
---
Yeah....and how exactly do you prove that knowing intent in this game? I didnt realize they were handing out certificates of authenticity.
---
This isn't a thread about frankly minor UI glitches. It's about the complicated and harmful duplication glitches.
---
But as for those frankly minor UI glitches, yeah, it's possible they were just negligent. It's also possible that the bugs weren't replicated in their testing, or that they were pushed live to make deadlines because of how minor they were.
---
But in any case, it's unreasonable to expect them to have found this specific exploit.
---
Nope, the ones I made are still there. And they're still available to make as well.
---
Ah ok I didn’t know that. I just started playing again for the first time in like 5 months
---
Never stopped
---
Yep, and I'm not selling enough items at my own camp to make up for the caps I'm spending on goodies and fast travel. It's just so tempting, all those green camp markers...
---
I like the money but yea people seeing my hours of effort helps motivate me to keep improving it. So it annoys me when people lock their camps like I’m going to go in an steal their globe lamp or something, like I can understand locking extractors and such but why make the camp and then make sure no one sees it? Heck I live in the mire one of the rougher neighborhoods and I keep my doors open for people so no excuse for these forest dwellers
---
I thought all the dope glitches got patched a few months ago
---
I hope your customer service is better than Bernard's... Otherwise I'm going to the shop next door run by the dude played by Simon Pegg (forgot his name, even though I rewatched the show a couple of weeks ago)
---
&gt; IPs 
---
can't do that, many IPs are dynamic, as in, a persons IP is can change with time based on whatever their ISP decides, and you typically have to pay extra if you want a static IP, which I think you need if for example hosting a server or such
---
Ah ok, so if you’re hunting the first two effects, and don’t care about the third effect, and have a choice of 2 for the first effect, you have a 0.03 percent chance to find something you want.
---
Still bad. It will take you several weeks/months of pure trade ins to make the item you want.
---
The important part is to have fun ! So just enjoy the game, it doesn't matter which level you are you will always find better weapons after the main story.
---
I will enforce that sqeee... For this is perfect for me. I am about to check it out. Hopefully i can use to this to find what i need in the form of mass levels. My main is a crafter and now with this vending setup i will be making a ton of antibotics and stimpacks. As well as plenty of other drugs.  Not to mention booze too.
---
Sorry, I get a bit to deep into lore, both reading it and think of it
---
Yes I’ve been there several times and it’s lot less legendary enemies maybe 1 if your lucky
---
No problem! It’s a cool story.
---
Does anyone have answers to the tadpole examine there so hard
---
You obviously ment plans right? Because you can't get the costumes from trick or treating encounter. The chance has become even lower because of the new added random encounter. By the way there are three random encounter spawn spot by the Crevasse Dam not one. And more then 15 in the Mire and the Bogg.
---
Next try: sell it to a vendor, then buy it back
---
So many "stealth nerfs" that gamers (of any game) post PSA's about turn out to just be a string of bad luck. For this game in particular a lot are malicious rumors started by people who hate Bethesda and want the game to fail. Less scrupulous gaming sites report on the rumors and fan the flames of gamer outrage for more clicks.
---
But what's the point of duping now if not just to be an asshole? Which such a small cap limit it's not like anything extra gets dumped in escrow.
---
Awesome! Apologies if the request was already made, but can you do stealth boys and hallucigen gas canisters?
---
It's mostly outrage culture doing its things and clickbait titles. However I don't really mind seeing Beth getting shit on, since they reap what they sow.
---
I have a nice little farmhouse near Watoga, which comes with personalized assaultron guards from the local town. In probably 200h of playing with my camp there, I've only had to server hop to put it down once or twice. If we all had a standard location for camps, you would have to hop servers multiple times a day just to put your camp down
---
The only quest reward I would definitely wait to get is All Rise (Mayor for a Day). Most of the others are good but not great.
---
Die
---
Same when I see someone but something I'll fast travel home and shadow them till they leave. They problably think I'm stalking them but I just like to watch them look at my camp
---
You dont put a luxury store next to strip mall stores. 
---
Jk i dont think that would work. 
---
I see alot in the white springs, top of world, harpers ferry triangle. 
---
Why? Central location for cheaper fast travels in savage d, mire, and cranberry bog for higher end content. Where as 76 is already a ft point, so you would just be blowing all your caps to fast travel from 76 area to the above mentioned area content.
---
learn to take a joke
---
Play the story quests
---
I set up near whitespring on the hills near the watch tower and I get a lot of traffic.
---
Is it called green leather hood or just green hood? I found a green hood on that bench near the whitesprings bunker yesterday, almost sold it then I realized I didn't have one yet
---
They are, they just dont drop from deathclaws. SB piles, mutant meat bags and trash cans are your best bet.
---
I found him in the Overseer's Camp "random encounter" point, where the Reenactor and lemonade guy show. I have the audio at very low level, I didn't notice anything special and I finish him. :(
---
Skeleton suit and mask can be found in the game world. The witch hat too, but I'm not aware of any place the witch outfit spawns naturally. Plans for them and the witch outfit/hat can only be found on the random encounters of dead trick or treaters.
---
I personally think they're not being triggered hard enough on duping. Should be harsher on them.
---
Capturing as many workshops as you can and hopping back and forth fending them off.  The travel is free and you get caps , 300 to 500 exp depending on build, the drops from enemies and lots of plans. 
---
If I log in and no pals are around and I dont feel like questing I'll do the workshop grind for a couple hours, I enjoy it.
---
I've seen the scientist post-patch at the spawn near the overseers camp. Haven't seen the trick or treaters for months but I stopped looking for them once I got all their plans.
---
Yeah that was happened to me too. Suddenly I duplicated my US Government Supply Requisition halotapes. Server hopped and they were gone.
---
Expected cringe. Got joy.  
---
Excellent work
---
Totally agree. It's funny cause I read the news article, saw how it worked, got pissed, and came here to see that you had thought of the same compromise that I was thinking up haha (or something similar). 
---
The problem is that you're posting on this sub which is, since this game is dead to the masses, filled with fan-boys to which Beth can do no wrong since they are actually giving us updates (the beauty of setting low bars at launch). Criticisms will often be shut down unless it's about MTX stuff. I agree completely, though. This is just trading one grind into another (and not even really trying to hide it).
---
My base is actually modeled after a barn. Complete with corn and razorgrain for beer and my door is a garage door
---
Tbh the Fire Breathers would a really cool one.
---
Hey man, would you share why you prefer the combat rifle?
---
They are rarely sold but not impossible to find, they are just stupid expensive. I have never have enough caps
---
Thanks a bunch for this tip.  My 15 int crossbow with 200% durability just wasn't going to break any time soon, so hopefully this will help. 
---
Another thing I'm going to try is getting super drunk before I make it to take away some of the Int bonus to it's durability.
---
Not sure, looks like the hood from the assault gas mask
---
Im hopping at charleston for the vendor bot haha. No luck yet but I just killed my 76th cryptid so yay atoms. Are you on ps4?
---
Same here, many, many times over the last few days.  I've seen people randomly drop offline (and I get dumped out of their stores) only to see them or their CAMP reappear a minute later.  Those particular instances look to me like it's not a server crash, but the instability knocking individual people offline is pretty horrible.
---
Decontamination arch shower. I was an idiot and put a switch on it too close to my jukebox.  I can always tell when someone's come by my CAMP, used it, and left it running because of the damned classical music that greets me.
---
Nvm I see it, I'm dumb
---
Fun Fact: Pack Rat 3's weight on some of the Bulk items is not as light as Pack Rat 2's. (Bulk Steel as an example).
---
... Life in a Bethesda game... lol
---
Its because your camp is a sub asset tied to the character, your character needs to load in first before the game can check and place your camp down.

Unpopular opinion. Thanks to whoever had 17 xo1 jet packs and sold me one for 100 caps.

Lol that's a great alarm system

What do you suppose the rng numbers are currently?? Has to be way lower right?
---
I was able to work around the roofing issue by placing the roof first and adding the stairs afterwards. Floors been giving me issues to after the patch tho
---
I usually don't like stuff like that because it's so underwhelming, but the sheepsauatch is genuinely tough as hell to take out. I've seen it kill a landed scorchbeast without even mutating. The way they present the sheepsquatch as this silent assassin actually works and I love it

Need to either use the desktop version of the map, or just use the desktop (or buy a bigger phone!).  I'm thinking about re-purposing an old iPad as a map reader if I decide I need it ;-)

I was in the burrows when a ghoul just walked thru wall at a flatline. No up/down.

Yeah but the Scottish flag matches the Free States color scale. It’d be awkward with a tricolor. I’ll make a tricolor if you want

I’ve been working a lot plus the end of school has kept me busy with activities. So I literally haven’t played in over two months. Approximately when the first Helvetia event occurred. I’m scared to come back because of the amount of learning I’ve got to do

Good call i got a kindle i could use or use my desktop.
---
That’s sounds like some Kill, Laugh, Love right there. Well done!

Hes angry but not wrong. You dont need to throw around buzz words like stealth nerf. It's basically a trigger word around here now as you can see by this articulate fellow above.

Go ahead and buy the neon letters!  You'll be fine.  
---
Your new endgame is buying ALL of the serum \*recipes\* from MODUS :)

The screenshot is from the production vendor in the bunker at White Springs. Pretty sure it's just a typo...
---
They have all 3 for sale in there so I thought I would ask here....
---
It does. Maybe we will get an aerosol geck or something that will temp terraform an area for few. Kinda like a reverse nuke. 
---
It would be a weird thing to have us look for a Geck when we are supposed to be rebuilding as is. Know BGS they’ll find a way to add them in if they need them.

Lol I don’t need commission, I just want to see people enjoy the factions they love and I want to see more rep for the Free States!

Only one

I think waiting is pointless, by the time you hit 50 you should have found better legendaries than the quests offer anyway. 
---
As for leveling, hit up the golf course or west tek or really anywhere that realiably spawns large mobs.
---
 If you do the mayor for a day quest in watoga you'll get the all rise which is a great melee weapon for lvls 30-45 but not so great after that. Once its done the robots are no longer agressive and you can just run around smashing them for 80-100 xp per.
---
I haven't hit possum yet ( quest is bugged and not showing anymore) but I did see my first camp fire tales this morning.... That's across 3 worlds and multiple hours of play
---
Super appreciate it!  I’m looking for the ability to craft the actual arms and legs.  Do you know (or anyone else) if any of those plans work to craft the pieces or just the mods?
---
I’d also like some help with this.
---
Thinking of respec’ing to a heavy weapon build but it would literally take me 20 perk points to just change SPECIALs and then a bunch more points to get the cards I actually want. 
---
I’d like to figure out how to be better at SBQ with a rifle
---
Hmm I went to whitesprings bunker and don't see any benches
---
I’ll get to work!
---
I understand that but it was more of a question. I dont want the game to fail, I like survival games but they always do them on unestablished ips. So this game is one of my favorites because it has "lore"
---
if you had ever played the previous games you'd know there was an experiment in one of the vaults and the super mutants were the result, however they were only released around 200 years later, and the only excuse could be a handful escaped the vault years before 76, however the vault is still over 200-300 miles away. Super mutants never originated in WV, so itd still make no sense out of any of this.
---
Still getting it today, not sure what to do at this point. Guess I'll submit a ticket to Bethesda
---
Like I said, it fits perfectly with the confederate theme but you will always run the risk of people saying it looks like it represents the racist side of it not the ancap side
---
I feel you... I'm No longer able to place down any vegetables since they're always 'floating' apparently xs
---
It's actually Alpha silo, thx Bethesda for misleading description...
---
Apparently it’s a known issue by the team. Some people aren’t able to login to their main character, myself included. I was told to try logging in tomorrow and see if it is fixed.
---
This is a great project my only complaint is on the all Ore map it is very hard to tell the difference between uranium and junk piles color. Otherwise amazing job!
---
A "pacify" it, then loot it, then take a picture. Seems dead creatures, even if a bloody mess, count.
---
You gotta move points around to max a stealth sniper build. You need 15 perception. 3 concentrated fire 3 long shot and the other 9 point for rifleman perks. Ninja only works for melee. So you don’t need that.
---
Try right at sunset and a good server hop. I had two in a row. The cleanup and bug repellent quest have chances to drop it as well.
---
Lol I also made this one if you want to go ancap
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/IXNEV1y
---
Oh, so you're saying the glitch was that it was basically rewarding you doubly? Unlocking the mod for crafting AND giving you a set of plans for said mod?
---
I can barely even tell them apart. No way will I be spending 3 badges on this, you're a gentleman and a scholar OP. I wish you well on your journey to recoup your spent badges.
---
Does this mean there will be less d-bags in adventure mode?
---
Wait... So, was it a duper server crash that caused my friend and I to get DC'd the other night right as we were finishing the RobCo Junior Roboticist Tour?  Now we're both stuck on part 8/8 with no way to complete the tour activity/possum badge :S
---
So what I'm hearing is it's a waiting game
---
\*edit meant to say nodes not ore
---
I'm actually level 69.
---
This is super valuable information though so thank you! 
---
It might take me a few levels to move stuff around but I'll be using this.
---
If I make a video I'll be sure and give you credit!
---
This is great. I’m from Alabama- all of our local commercials are exactly like this haha
---
Agreed. Hilarious, especially the owl-masked spokesman. In literally anything other than Fallout it’d be stupid, but it fits so well here! I’ll have to check it out if we’re on the same server.
---
I heard about him yeah.
---
Having a flag is the opposite of the free states philosophy.  Are you the Enclave?  The BoS?  Stand on your own two feet.  Who needs a flag.
---
Yeah as usual there are a lot of bugs in this DLC.
---
Yup. My issue started last night. I texted with a Beth tech support and nothing worked so it seems there’s nothing we can do for now. Really hoping it’s fixed tomorrow for all of us. I’ve talked to 3-4 people who also have this issue so you’re not alone.
---
According to a video I'm watching of someone using it (showing the stats in the Pipboy beforehand), it has a fire rate of 9.1 shots a second not 540 per second (which is what it says on gamepedia's entry, but that's wrong), same as a 50cal machine gun.  12 seconds would be 109.2 ammo (9.1\*12).  Since you can make an average of 42 (20 base + 16 Ammosmith + 6 Super Duper) ammo per craft now, that's 2.6 crafts of it.  So 26 acid, 13 oil, 5.2 steel.  Still a lot of acid, but not an absolutely ridiculous amount.
---
Wait, what happens if you accidentally dupe
---
IMO diseased ghouls used to be treated as unstarred legendaries but not after patch 9.  No, I have no special information.   Just seems to be my experience.
---
Just ruining the economy by doing this if anyone that dupes is seeing this I’m giving you the finger just learn to play legit 🤷‍♂️
---
Yours is a different color
---
I make rounds to the actual vendor locations not just WS and have been checking out camps for ideas plus shopping...lol  
---
I'm pretty sure there are plans available. If I see them, if they're cheap I can grab them and take a screenshot to not overcharge you.   
---
I haven't looked for them so if you find them in the meantime I'll just use them.   
---
The Deep pocket plans above were drops. I didn't use them since I don't use the robot armor.,
---
The current rng is definitely VASTLY lower because it's the entire loot pool and also depending on the enemy that you kill, there's no guarantee of a max level item.    
---
At least with Purveyor you can limit to melee ranged or armor, and I'm guessing it will be leveled to your character so max level so long as you are 50+  
---
The other unknown is if there's any weighting.  There's anecdotal evidence that certain items are more likely to drop than others, which would make it less likely to get a specific item if that item has a lower weight.
---
Lol, I know.
---
But there's gotta be a way that stops crashing servers. 
---
I was looking through one guys feedback and items sold and he has easily made 10k in the last two months.
---
Like, I wish I had no morals because I hate my job. Hahahah
---
I believe the traveling Responder bot can have the witch outfit to sell, but that and the plans from the trick or treater are the only ways to obtain it that I know of.
---
American "libertarians" -- fascists who can't admit it to themselves.
---
Did you try unplugging it and plugging it back in?
---
The only quest worth waiting until level 50 for is mayor for a day. Ive got hundreds of hours on my character and still haven't found a better super sledge than all rise
---
That was Iwhat happened to me.
---
So that would be:
---
Rifleman 3
---
Expert Rifleman 3
---
Master Rifleman 3
---
Long Shot 3
---
Concentrated Fire 3
---
Is concentrated fire only useful in VATS?
---
The plan for it or the actual mod? Thanks!
---
I don't think it'll ever be illegal, but why Bethesda isn't issuing take down notices to these sellers is beyond me.
---
Thank the lord I'm not alone but this issue shouldn't just appear randomly not allowing people to play sadly
---
Super duper is legitimate. When they say duping, they mean exploiting to force a loophole to generate more of something. For example, if you crafted 1000 ammo *then* used a glitch to double it and double again, that’s duping.
---
Enter and prepare the join the Cult of Mothman, or be destroyed, heretic!
---
Yes, exactly. Now that i saw this post i realized it was a bug. I didn't know where i got the second plan from because i did a lot of treasure hunting and events before i realized.
---
Mine did this bug slso, as soon as I completed one of the objectives it popped back up.
---
It only pops when someone is there.  Just server hop at Adams and you'll get it quick
---
I wish ammo was different for this. I've loved the flamer since fo2 when people should do that little death animation for it. 
---
Why even have that friendly fire perk cars if flamers are this worthless?
---
No worries, that's already been done. You should find it under the section for specific ingredient lists, labelled as Phantom Device.
---
Yes. And every star of concentrated fire increases your damage. I’d definitely use vats for your build. Maybe add points to luck and get better criticals too.
---
I think an Irish themed one would fit better given the English oppression and them overthrowing the English rule and then moving to American being discriminated against and then rising up as some more prominent Americans
---
To add you could release robots into wilderness that repeats the ad as well.
---
I have it on my server currently IGN Bacchuus
---
Yeah it’s pretty frustrating. I was playing last night and served hopped to try and find a charging Tesla Rifle mod at Watoga. When I tried to rejoin I kept getting that message and haven’t been able to login since. If I hear anything else I’ll let you know. 
---
Apparently there was maintenance today and haven’t tried so I might do that.
---
it doesnt show up if you’re not selling anything
---
Yeah but again it doesn’t match the colors and it would just be a tricolor.
---
Theres a place to pick one up... the path of something idk
---
Near it is an archery range (left side past water and the gazebos)
---
Also, doesnt need to break, just used till the repair option comes up
---
I shot like 10 arrows at a tree
---
I want the one found on Mothman cultist corpses!
---
Lucky for You. My two star TSE handmade just disapeared the other day. Customer supports response was that this happens once in a while.... Sad day
---
OP gets disconnected every single day while setting up workshops
---
I mean if there are 5 TSE handmades or something in someone's vendor it's obviously duped. Hence why I said don't buy it. Don't need magic or a Harvard degree to know some things are duped. :)
---
Not winning today I see...
---
on PC?
---
Good idea.
---
I bet they can scan all the shops at once and see if people have 120 tse for sale and then will send out a ban wave
---
&gt; what I've read on here.
---
Where
---
I use to go lay in my bed when the servers were going off for the day.
---
True tho you could try do multiple stars with chains that link them all and have them breaking where they connect
---
Also bloodied build. Your a glass canon that can one shot almost anything while stealthed
---
I have! I have gotten as far as 26 October, but when you get off of the game, or even server hop, the date resets back to the 23rd.
---
This, this is what the game was made for
---
We can also magically create a second Item when crafting with Super Duper. Suspend your disbelief it's a game.
---
&gt;Hell, I even gave 5000 caps to my friend a few days ago so that she could buy some stuff!
---
You're never getting in there...
---
Lmao of course. Of course.
---
Yeah no kidding. I was just curious to see how far people have gotten. I wonder if it’s by player or by server.
---
That kind of cheered me up after a stressful few hours. Definitely one of the best things I’ve seen on this forum in a while. Made me wanna Come on down to Neff’s. Lol.
---
nice, cant wait to feel brave enough to go there
---
You just got a new customer, sir.
---
Me too.  I have a melee charactor so ended up saving all the ammo I picked up until like level 30 and had to clear it out.  Would be nice to be able to sell it.  Can you sell ammo via a camp vendor??
---
I've tried with my high lvl today and nothing just keeps disconnecting
---
I'm all for this but if they get fixed, I remember them being hella buggy, I removed it and part of it stayed and would not be deleted it.
---
Great post!
---
I’m sorry that’s a bit confusing to think of, can you be a bit more specific?
---
I'm really glad to hear that. Hope things work out for you!
---
At least you get to play the game. I got banned until further notice because I moved a lot of items over a 30 day period according to them but that’s because I was literally trading, buying and selling....like they told us to do...because WE are the NPCs lmao
---
I honestly have no sympathy for anyone that plays that game anymore after how they fucked me for doing what Lord Todd said.
---
If you need the robot chest plan, I know there’s a plan location at Camp Venture in the bunk room inside the enclosed area. If you face the kitchen area it’s on the bottom shelf on the left side of the room in the corner. For me it was always torso mods, but I think the torso itself can spawn there
---
I paid money so they should work around my schedule!!!!
---
thank you
---
I found one vendor selling them at 895 caps a peace. I guess somebody bought them because they're not there today. I'd never bought them.
---
'cos nothing says "free states" like defending slavery.
---
I love this analogy but if you need to wipe your butt for free you can poop for free at the store.
---

---
I've had a great time. Maybe he's only fucking with the assholes?
---
If you jump up above the main entrance door to the little wooded hill, there will be an alley to the left leading to the main whitesprings. One of the tables has a nuka bottle and a board game, one of the benches usually has some headwear. It tends to be something common, but I've seen a clean spacesuit helmet there before
---
Been out of the loop on this game for a LONG while, so bare with me here but 1) how does duping affect other players and 2) can Bethesda not patch this out?
---
Thanks. If I can save one person their tokens it was worth it!  :)
---
And I’m not really seeing it as a complete waste. I think the darker color goes better with my outfit, plus it won’t get as dirty. 😂
---
Like on the american flag in fallout individual chains that link to each other breaking where they connect with the other chains to represent the states freedom and rebellion against the federal America/enclave. Though your original flag still looks amazing
---
As was the battle flag of the confederacy.  You think this shit is *accidental*?
---
That is absolutely fantastic!
---
If your on PC I can give it to you. IGN Dr.Patrick_
---
Would it be text to speech for when they announce it?
---
Like:
---
“Hey y’all, want someplace to buy stuff? Then come on down to [TEXT TO SPEECH]’s shop for whatever needs you need!”
---
Just got done taking the screen capture. Yeah it's a lead deposit almost directly south of the federal disposal field workshop. I'll PM you the link  :)
---
Looooove you
---
This makes me about 300 caps a night easy.
---
You can get the plans for them at crevasse dam, asking if you still can. It's a random encounter spawn.
---
I'd love shotgun turrets but I lack the plans and the perks. The missiles work well aside from the obscene friendly fire. X)
---
That was the first place I went for the athletics test. Spent about a half hour failing it and only got as far as the hanging logs part before I gave up and came to Reddit to see if anyone else was raging at that test. That's when I found out were the real tests were and I was so happy.
---
I made exactly that yesterday and started collecting all over again. 😁
---
Same goes for Fat Man and the Possum's Atomicist challenge.
---
Yeah, I was upset when that happened. 
---
On a positive note, I now stock up on some of the stuff beforehand so I'm not competing with other players for spawns when the dailies reset.
---
Yeah my game accidentally crashed last night and upon coming back in, my green icon was gone and I had to put back all my inventory that I was selling. Was pretty bummed. So looks like the same has happened to you.
---
I’d love to see blank billboards that players can rent out while on that particular server.
---
There's more than one Reich, too.  Sensible people might thing before using those symbols and names.
---
ok, and the robot vendor is dead...so probably dont have a big reason to go in there anymore.  but good to know.
---
Just visit Camp Adams at night and it should start, unless it happened already that night. Not a rare event at all.
---
Im getting on in like an hour
---
Yeah i just check on it thats what happened thanks
---
No, I was thinking it would be more like you could record any message you want
---
This is a wonderfully inclusive and conclusively edited post. It will be referred to in the future for sure.
---
My problem is that someone whines about a stealth nerf to legendarys after EVERY patch and so far its only ever been proven once. Every other time people just stir up shit for a few days and then go right back to farming as usual.
---
I used the Greek lettering and metal lettering to label my.vending machines. 
---
One is for plans, maps, mods etc. one ammo, chess aid, and one weapons and armor. 
---
Its worked really well and people have complimented it and thanked me.for saving them time :). I will update with pics in a bit.
---
Mono = one 
---
Rail = rail
---
I learned this the hard way 😂
---
Ah. The only problem I see is people screaming racial slurs into the recording
---
Cool....
---
unfortunately, i am on xbox
---
How long has duping been an issue? Yes people could play the game as designed and not exploit it, but to say it is not Bethesda's fault is exactly why the game is in the state it is. It is their product, if they don't want people to do this it is 100% on them to fix these issues.
---
Which is why I think there should be a report system that would be taken seriously. I very much see where your coming from though.
---
Ah ok ty, I found it. Had a skiing hat tho, wilt have to keep trying
---
That would also be cool
---
They banned the dupers quit blameing them for bethesda ruining a game build...
---
What platform?
---
Just checked, it looks identical. Even has all the tape on the back. It's the assault gas mask without the gas mask part. Mine is just called "green hood" though, and I know I found it on that bench. There might be a different clean variant called green leather hood though, the game has a lot of things like that
---
While your intentions are good, the result tends to be the same. Basically, the jerks that came before you used up all the benefit of the doubt people had, so try not to take the reaction personally, it's not meant personally.
---
Having the same issue. Find a fix yet?
---
ive had to run over two bridges for athlete.  foot bridges.
---
That ones actually way easier than you'd think. Just hang out near the water at the pioneer camp and eventually you'll get attacked by stingwings, bloatflies and blood bugs in rapid succession, outside of the event. Really helps speed things up.
---
In &gt;!the Enclave bunker one of the terminals has an email to the president about a theory that we're trapped in a simulation, and the only way out is to nuke a small town somewhere in China!&lt;
---
Ever figure out a fix for this?
---
what platform?
---
that's what the ammo is for!
---
I'm not justifying it but I think it's more to do with then exploiting ANY game they play and hoping to profit off it. Very doubtful it's an ego thing.
---
The giant one, where cars would drive
---
Next time I'll throw in a question mark
---
Beautiful.
---
&gt; ~~~Even~~~ Only  in the fallout universe video games kill people.
---
Well, I’d say that adds up. Lol
---
From what I hear you get 100 fuel for making a flamer.  Not much better but an option
---
The duper is making the choice to exploit. It doesn't matter how buggy the game is/was. **That person made a conscious choice to violate the TOS**.
---
Stop trying to pretend they're the victim.
---
They set it up along a *broken* bridge.  So, in fairness, there probably wasn't any traffic when the robots set it up.
---
If you check the most recent patch notes I think they mentioned a little previous cryolator and gatling gun weighting.
---
it is a picture of this guy:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Grahm](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Grahm)
---
Thank you for the information. This objective is preventing me to get my backpack. Will try right now. Got really upset due to this bug. Bethesda always breaks something that was properly working.
---
One point that maybe could have worked differently is the amount of scrip daily. But on the other hand people need 1* items for the daily caps also.
---
You could always lower their health with a different weapon then switch to the flammer to finish them off, I did this with the crossbow challenge.
---
The chest is the one I have 😭 but thank you that’s helpful for others!
---
Yeah, that’s a good idea. Another thing that could worry me is if people play copyrighted music, cause then Bethesda would get sued
---
i did this. scrapped all my junk, including the insect parts.  :(  had to say "do not scrap.  do not scrap" to myself the rest of the time.
---
Survival of the fittest!
---
I did this but it negatively impacts my travel costs. Im not a serious vendor but just trying to have fun with it. Theres shops in the area which i think is more appealing to shoppers. As long as you have neighbors vending youll be ok anywhere. Its the lone shops far from everything that may suffer the most from us cheapskates especially if they only have ammo or junk for sale.
---
If all the cats are facing in a circle, how are their butts pointing at your vendor shop?
---
Monopolies &amp; cartels FTW
---
Just make sure to have razorgrain and steel but its easy got it done in a few mins.
---
Whoosh
---
Better to not call it a nerf unless you're certain, with proof, that it's actually been nerfed.
---
My god, that's sophisticated.  In advent (colossal cavern) I had to hit BREAK then save the memory image of my game.
---
bro you know any good dupes?
---
I heard they got rid of that though, who knows?
---
fixed already
---
It's still alot but I can understand why since the recall circuit cost almost 2K.
---
Honestly, Adventure has been thriving with the Vending Machines. Everyone is running around shopping and visiting lol
---
There's always gonna be a few "d-bags" but it's really quite welcoming for the most part. Most PvPers have moved to Survival, especially with the new improvements to Pacifist
---
I both never duped and my main account is still suspended. I expect to never see it again. It's a shitty situation for literally everyone but the dupers. 
---
I had to buy a new account and start from scratch. I never cheated. Bethesda are far from perfect, if they where duping never would've existed to start with.
---
Relevant: http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2935
---
 this needs to be a sticky thread or something
---
no you can't have a positive on the *fallout* subreddit, on this one it's perfectly fine to have a positive opinion
---
Oh ok! If you need arms or legs, I think the plans that spawn at Treetops pull from the arms pool. If you go up until the level where the radstag carcasses are hanging, the plan is on a wooden crate next to a crafting bench. And the leg plans can spawn at Harpers ferry, inside the building with a hole in it that you spawn in front of when fast traveling there. They’re inside the first display case
---
Wow.  Thanks.
---
I saw that too. People selling the Old Man Winter for  **$70**, and more than one person doing it.
---
How comparable...
---
Community gets angry over people exploiting game, obviously get annoyed with those people and call them nasty things on the internet and to simply "stop it". Meanwhile also say it is NOT the developers fault for people exploiting their game and doing next to nothing about it. 
---
But by all means, defend Bethesda with this. I am sure that these people will stop abusing the game, it isn't like people have exploited games for decades now. The ONLY WAY to stop exploits starts with developers and them fixing their games.
---
Still can’t get credit for making a frog habitat.
---
One comment on disconnects, I have had a lot fewer discounts since I started using an ethernet cable connection to my router rather than connecting wirelessly.
---
That’s a good point. I’m not sure about anything to do with copyright legally but maybe there could be a copyright music detector before you upload it and the system would tell you you can’t upload it because of the song.
---
You’re right, they are still extremely overpowered. People shouldn’t be able to have a gun that kills everything in one shot.
---
no, just dark, now it's late spring and it's already sunny at like 4am
---
Well if this IS indeed true, I will certainly keep it in mind if I decide to move!
---
However, beings I made my camp probably over 100 levels ago... I don't quite know where the original spot was :\\ Furthermore, I don't know know which direction they'll face, even if I do base it on roughly the center of the green build-circle. 
---
BUT, at least now I know the hour I spent setting up signs and arrows, moving Razorgrain, all based on where ***I*** was spawning at my camp... have been in vain lol As it explains why despite all of that, people kept going to my cabin's front door (where I have a pressure-plate rigged to function as a doorbell via tone generators). 
---
So on that note: thank you :)
---
That was my initial thought.  I did the same with the syringer challenges, dropping the critters to very low health with my normal weapons, then finishing them off with the bleed-out mod.  I goofed around with an executioner's flamer I had in my stash against a couple bots in Watoga, and the ammo is still crazy hard to maintain, even post buff.  It's incredibly rare to come across just through normal looting and scavenging, too.
---
Yeah, plus I dont know of any children who get merit badges for setting off a nuclear bomb on their home countries soil...
---
I can enjoy the game and be frustrated with it sometimes.  Thankfully, my original question was answered by someone who wasn't actually being an asshole.
---
I installed the Fallout 76 mod for FO4. It wasn't the same but it worked.
---
Can I please borrow it for the challenge?
---
My IGN is same as here.
---
ill msg you on xbox
---
my best legendary cost me like 500 caps at a train station
---
Anti-Armour &amp; + 10% aiming damage black powder rifle, oh yeah!
---
Try Sunnytop Ski Lanes, that one has mines and traps.
---
Yep. Yeah those were my two biggest concerns, cause others like the player radio idea had similar concerns, but I’m sure that Bethesda could work it out
---
Idk what you call somethin then when it goes from 5 to 7 legendaries to 0 to 1 per run.
---
You sure can. I have all types I don't use in my shop. Although all those 40mm grenades take up a ton of space...
---
0.3 caps per bullet... before the economy was completely turned on its head. The cap price of an item is exactly the amount people will pay for it. I'll glady pay 1c-2c for .44 ammo and I'll buy you out. 
---
I have to work everyday. Hunting down ammo on some subreddit/website and then coordinate a sale in game has a price and it's measured in the most important currency any of us have: time.
---
They are. Most of the banned dupers have new accounts already.
---
Did it happen again?
---
bravo !
---
...I just want to spark, a flame in your heart...
---
I do want to set the world on fire though, so there's that
---
#whitepeople 
---
Just loves to twist everything around. I guess some people feel like they are helpless without asking for people for help all the time. It's called being self sufficient, but go get your village to be *YOUR personal camp guard for free lol. I help people all the time and even mark my inventory mostly 1 cap so people dont have to jump through hoops for things and I even message people with tips on how to get more business, but I guess I'm selfish if I dont want to help you with YOUR camp problem. The solution is easy, either you move or you build turrets and learn to sacrifice some of your camp look. Or you can cry about how everyone needs to look after you because you want it all and everyone who just walks by are selfish right? Like I said, #whitepeople
---
Speaking of... what exactly does it take to tame (not just pacify) a deathclaw? Animal Friend III doesn't seem to do anything, and Wasteland Whisperer III only lets me pacify but not tame deathclaws. What am I missing? Is my charisma (3) too low?

I am only trying to put a switched pylon, with a keypad to turn on and off my vending machines, and hide my CAMP location when claiming a workshop. I am trying to put on the floor, of course, but the game insists it is floating. 🤦‍♂️
---
Yeah had to buy it completes my hunting look
---
I have a deathclaw one I put in in front of my camp
---
A while back with that TSE scare I found a lv40 TSE combat shotty at the enclave bunker. Think it cost me 480 caps lmao

thanks man

Something I said when over your head?
---
As, surely, you cannot seriously be thinking I wasn't already aware that the "Neon Signs" being an end-game goal was all in jest... &gt;\_&gt;  
---
If so, /r/Whoosh indeed!
---
not atm sadly
---
The bridge was scary for me, good thing I killed the mobs before. that end part on the railing is something else
---
If you have 5.56, I will take all the bacon and eggs you have.  Wait, I don't think you heard me right.....
---
I started a thread on the various building problems people are experiencing.
---
I'm saying how they could improve the experience. Player vending is to help players.
---
1) it ruins servers and makes it unstable 2) it's already patched as far as I remember
---
I remember 600lb stash. That was also a rough time
---
Some plans that I've gotten so far from the event and the daily's:
---
Campfire tent
---
Scout Bowie knife
---
S'mores 
---
Mounted firefly
---
Just play it like you used to play it before you left (at least in Adventure Mode). If you’ve been gone long (several months) then creating a new character is probably a good idea in order to take in all the new content &amp; features in the game like it was a brand new game. You probably already know about the new modes and most features, and if not then go through all the patch notes.
---
Have fun!

They're not allowed to add Gambling until they re-add "Grandma plays the numbers" back to the radio

Around the time that I got Starched Genes &amp; got Speed Demon &amp; Marsupial along with Chameleon I’d run around in hooded rags &amp; a gas mask with a cultist blade as a weapon.
---
Please don’t use my flag post on a video game to get into a political rant
---
You literally cannot accidentally dupe, trust me lmao.
---
After an update you Fallout76.ini file might not update— for example if you use mods. The updated ini file has the links to new textures and assets. This happens to me every update, and I don’t use mods. I am not near computer but later I can post what your current ini should be
---
&gt; Lucky for You
---
eh, my 5 hazmats got duplicated into 10, not really worth bragging about lol, though the duplicate ones were at full health ¯\\\_(ツ)_\/¯
---
No, because he didn’t mention the the recently-sold products being obsolete and needing replaced in 6 months =D
---
You're just utterly missing the point of why people dupe.
---
Not to get caps to go shopping with. Obviously if they just wanted to play the game and get by they would find caps like  normal players. We dont need to hear how you say the game normally and have plenty of caps. Completely  besides the point. 
---
It's a JOB to these guys. They are fuelling online stores that sell caps for real money. Selling items for real money online. 
---
It's not just impatient players entering a cheat code for some caps to go shopping with. Smh.
---
Every MMo has rooms full of actual employees that just farm shit and if they can, exploit bugs, to pad the massive amounts of caps online stores need.
---
Too bad you are not on PS4 cause I was sold!
---
Not in the UK lol
---
For the love of Todd, can someone PLEASE pin this to the top so we don't have to see this same thing reworded 10 times a day?
---
But i did
---
Yeah seeing it a lot more now after the hotfix they pushed and people are all asking for money.
---
I have played The Burrows since launch and after three days the nerf occurred. In the first days I could find 5 to 7 legendaries. I think this was implemented due to the impact that nuking the area has on spawning more legendaries. For me, the legendaries spawing underground was not planned, but a great side effect.
---
Too much bow chica time, next one is here in October.
---
Make sure you have marsupial/a jetpack to reach the highest boxes, they're usually in there. Or alternatively I'm selling my extras at my shop for 400 caps :) IGN Ember33
---
In the toilet is where I found it
---
I found one in a footlocker directly behind the starting point. It was tucked away next to that little shack. Idk if it's a guaranteed spawn but I felt VERY lucky
---
How much does the capacity mod give
---
Bummer, and there is multiple versions of Sugar Bombs too... some with rads and some without and only some count to cook with.
---
I found one in a green box right where the swimming challenge is done where you have to swim to the buoys - sometimes the fashion assaultron in whitesprings sells it too
---
I agree it would have been useful to have it pinned.
---
Morgantown south of the super duper mart. There’s a small shack with a hot tub with skeletons in it. I found it right in front of the hot tub
---
How is it not Beth’s fault? They don’t know how to fix their fuckin’ bugs haha
---
Title: 
---
Has anybody noticed far less legendaries in the burrows or is it just me?
---
PSA: The Burrows seems to be spawning far less legendaries after patch 9. 
---
Those are just two examples.
---
Thanks :)
---
Jesus I sell most of my flux for 100/1 and cobalt 200/1
---
They said you should be able to tame Deathclaws with level 3 wasteland whisperer
---
I already have marsupial and I'm good.
---
"keep politics out of video games!" says the reddit use posting the in-game anarchist flag
---
I believe it was mention somewhere in the dev notes both of them are no longer tameable...
---
It suxs... dunno as to why 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Oscar worthy commercial right there.
---
I think that is way over the hard carry limit, and since perks dont translate to stash there has to be an issue there
---
I had about 30 post on my trade people try to  tell me " the Gauss explosive still drops " some misguided people out there still who believe cause the patch not didn't say " Tesla or Gauss " so the belief is that it still is available to drop as two shot explosive sadly
---
Good luck, then! Breach and Clear is one of my favorite events, try it again next time you see it and hopefully it will work!
---
There are plenty of viable locations. This one is mine.
---
I’ve seen many destroyed.  Even accidentally took someone else’s shower out when a group I was with was trying to hit someone that was attacking us but we found his teammate’s camp (this was before turrets and stuff were clearly labeled by owner).  Ended up repairing his shower for him because we get bad, and he had had the same thing happen recently before that.
---
So yeah, definitely was a problem for people, even if not your 15 people :p
---
Huzzah! A man of quality!
---
And Bethesda’s too dumb to fix their legacy bugs that resulted in duping in the first place. Don’t hate the player, hate the game company
---
They need to put that in the description.  I bought the backpack thinking I'd see if it was worth going through all the pioneer scout stuff to unlock the rest of it.  I already didn't want to do those quests, wasting five bucks on a skin for an item I can't craft really doesn't make it suck less.
---
I agree it would have been useful; however, the subreddit should be heartened by the fact people want to return to the game.
---
Read this while waiting to reload after a blue screen.
---
+1 to the QE double, that’s my main as well.  But I haggled for two fast melee 3* knives and been having a blast running around stabby stabby stabby:  Furious SS switch blade and a Vamps SS Bowie.
---
Man I feel bad for your walls.
---
Damn are you Osmium friend? Because you’re dense as fuck!
---
Thanks I’ll look for it now
---
Can you do one for hide bundles of various types?
---
Upper floor of the shroud manor. Main bedroom.
---
Will do. It's my favorite too.
---
I tried and there was no option to do so.
---
I think you had the fire rate on the cryolator set to 1 as a placeholder and forgot to change it (since no one in their right mind tries to use a cryolator for damage...). It should be 9.1 according to pics I see of it in the pipboy.
---
As with every MMo there are rooms full of employees in countries all around the world who do  nothing but farm caps and use exploits to stock online stores. 
---
People will crucify me for admitting g this but I dont have any time to game, maybe 8 hours a week tops so I've bought caps online. It was 15 bucks for 10000 caps and it saved me cou tless hours of time and allowed me to get a bit ahead in terms of plans and things. 
---
It's an MMO so it's really just par for the course I dont think it's a huge deal really. The games economy has been wonky from the start and I dont play enough to care if its utterly broken.
---
Every other mmo in history has the same thing going on it's just the way of the world.
---
&gt;I can’t believe no has agreed with you yet. 
---
Thanks very much but, for the record, I am not surprised.   This will sound harsh, but I have to say it. I notice a pattern: those who post threads with legit criticism and that make legit points often seem to get down voted to hell.  And no,  I'm not just talking about me.  I think [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn2m6l/youll_probably_only_be_able_to_purchase_1_of_each/)raises very valid concerns about the upcoming legendary vendor: thus far, it has a big fat zero and 36 percent upvote.
---
The only criticism I've seen here betting upvotes are complaints about repair kits in the atom shop.  They called it a "pay to win mechanic."   Never mind the fact that you can get better repair kids from killing the queen without spending a penny.
---
Another post that will likely earn down votes but I thought it needed to be said so there it is.

I made my camped themed around the responders values. My base has a church, workshop with all the fixings, then I have small farm next to my church with wheat and corn, Behind the church is my moonshine shack. Then my main house has one bedroom and living area before you enter there is a deck with rocking chairs, Coach, banjo and grill. In front of my porch is campfire with chairs and sleeping bags so other players can take a load off or have place to sit or if their waiting to use the  vending machine. If I’m their and your low level I’ll drop stims and radaway with you free of charge to help those low level players push the through harder areas with ease.

As someone who played WoW for years in the early-2000s, I'm fully aware of these practices, and shamefully back in that youth I even purchased Gold once.
---
Did anyone (ie, you) take a moment to consider that perhaps I'm referring only to those who it isn't a 'day job' for? That I'm talking to those who actually do it simply because "they can"?
---
As I can assure you that it was to these individuals I was speaking of; the "you and I" who have chosen to take advantage of this exploiting. Which is the same reason I didn't buy a Marine Helmet (not the Tactical wetsuit hat) from a player vendor yesterday, even though it was only 175 caps and I would've loved to have it. I didn't, to not reward them for the exploitation (or in turn, whomever *they* obtained it from, and so on). 
---
To each their own I suppose. I think it's wrong either way, you think it's no big deal since it's just some person's way to earn a living.
---
lol I guess we should forgive Gun Runners as they may simply be doing it to provide for their family. *(and yes, [/s])*
---
Theres a line between being excited about people coming to the game and 80 posts a week about "Haven't played since the beta, thinking about coming back, any good reason I should?"
---
What type of stairs are you using
---
What if everything was free? Would that improve the experience by helping players? How about if enemies did no damage? Would that improve the experience? Would that help players?
---
That's great to hear haha
---
You can run a shop, but can you arrange soup into a tower?
---
A nickel? Man idk if I could personally take such a risk
