Oh no the big billion dollar bethesda is getting bullied again by the little folks exposing thier lies and poor workmanship. making the game to hacked full of holes to play so they have to implement the final solution isn't bullying its heroic.
---
Since I have it I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs still available. It shows under Fallout 1st in my left side list but not in my ‚Äòfeatured‚Äô list at the top.
---
I have never had anyone be this nice to me when I commented on something and I really appreciate it thank you and love back to you and yours as well fellow vault dweller
---
She had 32k base, but a flat 70% damage resistance. Combine it with the regen at the hallway point and I think it works out to roughly 130k in damage to take her out.
---
I am not saying god roll items should drop all the time but there should be a way to grind out just armor pieces or weapons, like certain events only drop armor and another could only drop just weapons so the odds of getting something aren't so miniscule
---
Omg really! I‚Äôll submit a ticket as my two characters share it and my partner stopped playing because it affected my cap limit. Thanks for telling me. Hopefully Bethesda can fix it for me x
---
I get those video's because I look up camp builds, item locations, mob locations. All one has to do is type in Fallout 76 camp builds, and out of the 25 actual videos showing you how or how others have their camp builds, you will get the other 75 hating on fallout for the camp build budget, then how a patch was supposed to fix something, to nothing at all about camps but about how they hate the game, because of lack of camp budget.
---
I‚Äôve got a ton of Ultracite PA plans if you need, they‚Äôre all priced at about 20 caps each too because I don‚Äôt care about making money off them, just want to share them with whomever needs them. 
---
I‚Äôm on PC as well, feel free to add me-Shiimmy
---
My camp is located in the Savage Divide
---
I just try to be a nice player: engage with others, be courteous, wave a lot, help out lower level players when they get overrun, never one shot if I'm not alone, give out care packages and level appropriate gear/legendaries, point out 3* enemies after tagging, sell everything at reasonable to low prices, thumbs up for good camps, hearts for considerate players, never attack workshops and generally don't be an asshole.
---
The elevators worked fine what the hell are you talking about?
---
A revamp scares the shit out of me but if that revamp includes a way to recover/delete the items that placed themselves inside my pre existing structures walls and roof, sunk too far to into the ground to grab.. then I'm all for it.
---
I agree, but country roads, ring of fire, and that beach boys song don't fit either üòë
---
I agree and I do as well(hence why i said what I said) but being that today reddit has been free of any reports as of yet, and it was 'live' report for 2 hours already on official forums (And I just now noticed it) I am passing info I saw along for those not dipping into both sources of info.

With the hack as it happened not even being whispered by Bethesda until it was already ACTIVE and ABUSED for almost 2 days straight and only spoke up about it as they took servers down, I do not trust 'official Bethesda' statements on this regard and would rather pay attention to other users instead of a 'oh sh!t me timbers, I just became a victim of the exploit that I had no clue was even a thing until AFTER It hit me and I googled up what happened and found it was known about for 2 days BEFORE I got hit'
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Personally, I would have much rather had Bethesda made the info public, even without killing servers to fix, when they found about the exploit, rather than wait until after I (along with countless others) got smacked and had sent tickets in.
---
I'm almost positive it's 15 minutes. I tested it a few times and it's more than 10, but less than 20.
---
It was for all formats
---
I do agree that consistency is good. I also think that these items should be hard to earn.
---
Since NW is still in BETA, it's hard to tell if this is an inconsistency or if this was intentional.
---
Hello friend I too am having a dificulty time with the holidays this year, sadly my daughter and only child took her life in July and it has destroyed me and my family which consisted of myself my wife and my mother. We aren't even celebrating christmas on top of that my land lord passed away and the property has to be sold so I'm stuck trying to find a new place to live and being the owner of a great dane not many places are willing to rent to large dog owners and I don't understand why when my dog is a well mannered animal 100% house broken but small dogs are fine and I've personally seen chihuahua and other small dogs freely use the bathroom indoors my dog wont. I have been having a really hard time with life lately and I don't see any end to this pain, I feel completely hopeless and hollow and have nearly shut down entirely I really don't have any intrest in playing 76 a game I enjoyed now it just feels like everything else just going through the motions. Good luck and I hope you are able to enjoy the holiday in spite of your current situation you deserve it.  Merry christmas.
---
You‚Äôre welcome! Learning to master this end game event has kept me engaged and interested. I love how it brings players together and as a new player it‚Äôs so epic! Some queen killers took me under their wing and taught me so much and it was an amazing experience I just want more people to enjoy it with as little frustration as possible.
---
I never said they should be hard to earn, but people thought the previous items were hard to earn, so they just made it harder
---
Santa doesn‚Äôt like it when you break your promises Beth, naughty girl!
---
You are literally bias: bethesda regularly posts creative photos of pve players and camps on their social media for fallout 76 I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen them post anything pvp related because they are terrified of the backlash from the majority of the playerbase that hate pvp and have asked that bethesda remove and change multiple pvp mechanics making the game less enjoyable for players like myself.The ironic this is that once these players removed camp destruction and slap damage pvpers became more creative to bring chaos into the wasteland and we used the fact that you cant destroy camps to build trap bases, that is called adapting and being creative against a community and devs that want to squash playstyles they dont agree with because they cant handle dealing with pvp players and are unable to follow basic rules that would allow them to avoid pvp entirely. Ie dont take workshops turn on pacifist.
---
Maybe boring isn‚Äôt the right word as its more subjective but grinding out legendary items and following the standard way to play the game just reinforces mediocrity and is against creative more innovative and effective gameplay. Back in the day I made thousands of caps per day killing players before they nerfed it and Id use the caps to buy legendaries that ppl would sell to vendors before scrip was a thing. That was far more effective that selling bull junk or making some things to sell for 1400 caps a day. Bethesda has designed this game to make players buy overprices ultility items to make their gameplay easier like fridges repair kits scrap boxes and if you support this gameplay design and play the game the way they want you to play you are ruining the video game industry fullstop. By stating that its ok for game developers to create mechanics that reward you for using your wallet as opposed to your brain.I have mules with weight reduction armour to prevent the need for a scrap box and mutations to have food with.
---
You are misquoting me most people will he somewhat annoyed if another player kills them it becomes toxics when you cant control you ego and start being abusive over chat because of this. Does my mother deserve to burn alive because I ambushed someone at a workshop? Because Ive been told that. If you don‚Äôt want to be a good sport about it then thats your decision but imo you certainly are less of a person for not being a good sport.
---
You literally ignored everything I said and say time doesn‚Äôt matter? Again which method got the hack patched faster? The reports from youtubers and other sources or the hack going live and people losing their stuff? The vunerability was reported before it was used beth did nothing. In fact modder talkes about things like this being possible on release due to the lack of authentication checks and bethesda denied it. Bethesda is happy to live in denial and not accept responsibilty for the flaws with the game and the players suffer because of it. You cant control what the hackers do you can only control what you do im not blaming the victims just giving them practical advice: what 10min news vids and then you can know when big exploits are coming stay offline because you can‚Äôt trust bethesda to help you their team is a joke. Do you really want to risk losing your items the hope bethesda will restore it exactly the way it was? Sounds better to stay offline. Hackers are shit people but again, you cant control what they do. The only reason they exist is bethesda.
---
Omg I remember this! I love this show this made me genuinely smile thank you lol!
---
I just want to be able to remove trees and shit so random branches clip through my walls.  I‚Äôd be so happy if that happened.
---
Look buddy, if your recent post history is any indication, you're not from around here and I don't think this karma farming routine is working out too well for you, so I suggest you take your username to heart and move on.
---
Griefer =/= hacker. 
---
There‚Äôs a clear difference.
---
What about the advanced (armored) one? Was that ever in the shop, or just granted?
---
Thanks for verying! I've always been paranoid about losing progress especially in online games.
---
Be pretty neat if there was a big update for a decently sized quest in relations to CAMPS. Whole new redesign, ton of new plans for all kinds of objects etc. And a revamped Atomic Shop with more listings, that aren‚Äôt taken away. I understand rare atomic items, but they need to stop ripping all of them away constantly. It‚Äôs no wonder the game cant be supported. Not everyone spends money right away to get it. I would have legit purchased Atoms for some things but they end up being taken off so I miss them.
---
If there‚Äôs an option to join non-crossplat servers I‚Äôm down.
---
Otherwise Im sorry PC players but I‚Äôm not dealing with all that
---
Playing in team with Insprational lvl3 is extra 15%  xp bonus. Combine that with Well rested for extra 5 % + Crannbery Cobbler for another 5% for 30min. If you complete The Path to Enlightenment event that's another extra 5% xp bonus for one hour. It's actually pretty easy to level up fast in this game üòâ
---
all  i want is for them to make "place anywhere" mod from fo4 where you could not just place anywhere but also position stuff and shrink /enlarge it put garbage  all around and make it static... , but yea not going to happen
---
so i'll be happy if they give us at least 25% more budget , so i could at least have 1 camp that is finished before i run out of budget like for example here [https://i.imgur.com/8QFLv3r.png](https://i.imgur.com/8QFLv3r.png) could have been nice, but soooo out of budget
---
I wish they modeled the Mothman in game closer to the statue. I know there are multiple accounts of what it looks like, but this is concrete. I think it looks creepy enough on its own to be a thing.
---
Last night I got ( PC ) after the fix. All was well until I went to a vendor with about 300 plans for sale and a level 2 inside.  As I was approaching to shop this level 2 ran outside in just underwear and started throwing punches. 
---
When I saw  the hacker uniform I jumped server asap.  Don't know if this dick was the real thing or an imposter.
---
I thought just previously I heard a Russian ( voice ).
---
They're supposed to be hard to earn. The problem is that Fallout is full of people who love to collect rare and exclusive items. Those same people don't usually like Nuclear Winter. The Nuclear Winter rewards are not intended for those people, but those people try to earn them anyway. That's why I compared it to the Olympics. No one in their right mind would complain that it's too hard to win a gold medal at the Olympics. Everyone who understands what the Olympics are also understands that it's not meant for everyone to win a gold medal. The same is true for the Nuclear Winter seasonal rewards. They aren't meant for everyone.
---
How does the budget thing work? I can‚Äôt add stuff even when I‚Äôm deleting stuff
---
Got the Nuka Girl pop today myself. Mothman is so cool though, gotta keep my eye out.
---
\_Just\_ a high level enemy, besides deathclaw island I can't think of many.  90-100% spawn rate of a high level enemy?  
---
There's a static deathclaw spawn in the basement of Emmett mountain disposal site.   
---
Quarry x3 and sunrise field spawn mirelurk queens 90% of the time for me.
---
Sack rummaging should be a perk.
---
Are you sure you're deleting and not just storing them? When you are in build menu head all the way left to the stored menu. Delete stuff from there by selecting and scrap it. :) A if you are on xbox
---
Haha 500 hours in and this was helpful!! Completely explains why my TSE Handmade is such a turd in those fights... Love the mention of placement for the non-nuke zone fighting! Especially helpful us Chameleon Armor players that like some Sneak Crits!
---
Nothing is a priority for Bethesda lol
---
It shows as a separate shop item. I think it was there on day one. The riot paint that can apply to either version was the skin that had a cost for 8 hours but was reversed to be free.
---
I get what your saying buy comparing the nuclear winter rewards and the Olympics isn't working, people spend years and years to prepare for the Olympics and if they did it hard enough they win gold and that gold is worth a ton, these nuclear winter rewards are just not comparable especially since it's not on the pro level and those rewards are way cheaper and I'm not saying they should make them easy to earn, even if they changed the way xp works its still gonna be hard for those who want them, were talking about years and years of work for the Olympics compared to a 3 week challenge to earn rewards, now if the rewards were money or a ton of atomic shop points I could see why it would need to be super hard
---
I hope I can still get the advanced one. Don‚Äôt really care about the green riot one, but I like the armored one a lot
---
There are a lot of things they could have done better.  There was much confusion early on over whether or not they were even looking into it, and it wasn't until midday on the 23rd that they even said anything.
---
Personally, I question the wisdom of why they kept the servers up after announcing that they were working on a fix.  I also continue to have serious concerns after this attack, and the Vault 94 issue a few months earlier, why procedures for restoring player inventories haven't improved.  The response people are getting from submitting tickets has apparently been "We're looking into ways to make this right, but it's going to take time."  This should be a very straightforward.  Either you have a backup and you restore that player's character or you don't.  We know for a fact they *can* restore accounts, so why is it apparently still this esoteric and manual process?  Especially if you're not going to make it any easier on yourself by keeping the servers up when you know full well that there's an attack in progress.
---
Are mutations limited time ? Or do you stay with them ?
---
Well they can hurt you. I got one shoted by a guy who I didn't engage in PvP with.
---
GT: ReparablePizza, I‚Äôm only on a couple times a week usually after 6 or 7pm New York time.
---
Honestly it's how it'd go if/when us gamers get stuck in a full dive world lol
---
How about this one?  [https://i.imgur.com/wUkgW7b.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/wUkgW7b.jpg)
---
Yoo, it'd be awesome to get this game on my new pc
---
No pc. But x box has all though quantoms because of the  glitch.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm scraping it, but still says I‚Äôm over budget. I‚Äôm trying to put that bahmir feed or what ever it‚Äôs called
---
Honestly, thos stupid battle royal mode shouldn't have even been added. This is a Fallout game. No CoD, not Halo, not Failtnite, but Fallout. The only three world selections this game should have is Adventure, Survival, and Private. Fallout isn't a competitive game, or a survival wave game  and if they waste time, and money making it into anything but a Fallout game, then it WILL fail....hell it's already failing, so if they don't add more of the shit this game actually needs as a Fallout game,  then it will most certainly die.
---
Or why they haven't simply introduced an auto backup of each character upon disconnect, and weekly(or more often) backups of entire database when they do maintenance.
---
Both those things, while not completely infallible, are no brainier first steps in any kind of networking.
---
It‚Äôs because you‚Äôre signed into your Xbox profile on PC I think. Mine says I‚Äôm playing league of legends all the time until I close my laptop.
---
ok thanks
---
BiAxialSphere00 here on Xbox One! I also play GTA Online as well on the same console
---
Ok dude. A griefer (someone utilizing an exploit to kill passive players) was at my camp causing trouble, right as someone else reported having all his shit stolen. 
---
I am not stating that they are synonyms. I was informing people about what _happened_.
---
It happened to me two times.and reason is closing app during sign inüòësorry to say but your only option is reinstalling the game
---
Cheers, thanks for the info.

Welcome to the community

This. Most times when I run by someone I just give a wave, to which I get one in return, and off we go. Makes me smile every time. Love it so much
---
Agreed.  They aren't availing themselves of some pretty basic functions.
---
Not the first time, nor the last I'm sure.

Literally the only one that I own.  It's ironically more detailed than your typical Funco Pop with how the legs and fuzz are done on it.

Mystery Pick really fizzled on my 3 alternate characters. Hoping for a jolly time when I bring my main on later.
---
On my low level toons my first perk is Pharma Farma. Best beginner perk ever. Stock up on all the stims, chems while your low.
---
Maybe a slower rate of fire and lower recoil..
---
I've wanted to get my friends into this game on pc but it was hard to tell them to buy the game when there was a hack letting people steal your inventory. Now that it's fixed it is not so bad and it would be easier to convince them to join with a free copy :)
---
I was at the main menu when i closed the app last time. However if what you say is true and i do have to redownload this game, i can honestly say I'll never come back. Its not worth the struggle.
---
Free range events spawn 1 or 2 Sheepsqautch.  Every now and then going to Pylon v13 will spawn one of those mutant buhemoths.
---
So PC still 'master race' LOL
---
If you close the app during sign in in anyway possible the game data will corrupt
---
Dang you guys really made the ranger armor super complicated to explain lol. There is 3 variants of ranger armor. We don't have elite ranger armor yet just normal and advanced. There's 1 skin available atm that changes the colors on both normal and advanced. In total there is 4 different variations of the armor but only 2 combinations for either normal or advanced. They're gonna release more skins for the ranger armor like desert camo so that'll up the variations for both normal and advanced to 3 each.
---
It‚Äôs not just your platform. I have about a 5% chance of crashing on pc when I use aid items in my pipboy. Opening presents has been a nightmare.

Are you sure about desert camo, etc? What is the elite variant? Are advanced and the green riot paint still available to get?

Hopefully someone doesn‚Äôt steal it from your inventory!

I've been playing for almost a week now and I was buying stuff from a dudes vending machine, I think he was level 119 irrc, got some 10mm ammo, assaultron blade blueprint, and probably something else. He had a shower out in his base and I had no idea what it did, I asked him and that kinda started our conversation, later on he gave me a level 10 BOS sniper, told me it held a lot of sentimental value as that was a weapon a higher level player gave him when he started the game.

The fallout 76 community is amazing and I'll be sure to keep the tradition going
---
A "PSA" should have all relevant info the first time around but hey tantrum it up, bud. I've yet to see a single case of this happening on PS4 so I think I'm good.
---
GT is MickJayPlays
---
My main is just about to hit L100 so I can help out some, too. :)
---
Add it to the list of things Bethesda will never add to their cash grab game
---
What lore did they break?
---
My Best Experience was the Time where the Energy Weapons got buffed and Anti Armor works on them. I love to play them since Fallout 1. 
---
since i want to do a Fallout Marathon in March with my New PC and i want my Friends to enjoy this with me together cause my other Friends are on PC and my PC is too bad for 76 so im playing right now on the Console and had fun with some People from Fallout Discord did Encryptid together or launching Nukes
---
If Nuclear Winter is easy and doesn't require time and effort to get good enough to win, then why is anyone complaining? I got all of the current rewards the same day they were released. If they take less than a day to earn, what's the big deal?
---
oh boy..
---
I actually really prefer the game's interpretation to this.  The statue looks neat as a monsterous creature, but the in-game Mothman is a perfect blend of scary and cute.
---
You use them to craft that vault power armor
---
lol
---
These actually helped me out a lot, because at the time they were released my internet was so bad it didn‚Äôt let me open the atomic shop, so I would legitimately wait hours for it to open or load, but these forced it open without the need to load it. While they didn‚Äôt look nice, they were at least there to help.
---
You should go read the other 30 or so threads that asked this same question this week. It's been discussed at length, especially after the PC hack.
---
For you it may be easy, but not everyone is amazing or has the time to put in to get good and even the people who do have the time, they might not be able to place high constantly
---
There‚Äôs not many games that are MMORPG based that you can create literal towns with your friends, explore, meet others, fight others, and be a part of an active trading community. A lot of others enjoy the glitching aspect (hacking, duping, etc) and they enjoy running the underground portions of the society and also the underground black market of sorts.
---
Because it's fun? Don't worry so much about what other people like.
---
Good luck!
---
I got the teal t51 armor and the excavator armor! Plus tons of game of thrones ones
---
I tried to click the link but computer crashed. 76 content indeed.
---
What time? You said it's not like the Olympics. The Olympics requires lots of time, effort, and practice to get good. You said Nuclear Winter doesn't. They might not be on exactly the same scale, but I would argue that Nuclear Winter does require time and effort to get good, which is why these rewards aren't easy to earn.
---
Bad Troll back under your bridge.
---
So infinite scrap isn't pay to win? Explain to me how? Without attempting to degrade another person.
---
whether it‚Äôs fun or not and you know what my wife and I miss this game pretty often
---
How the fuck can players let alone Bethesda and Fallout fans still support this greedy company. Like HOW.
---
There are a handful of locations that can spawn legendary Sheepsquatch.
---
There's pics of all the ranger armor in one of the topics here. In total there's 9 variations for ranger armor. 3 for each one. Normal base color, riot paint, desert camo. Look at the link to see the elite armor. It just has alittle more stuff on it compared to advanced and you can look at the desert camo. All the ranger armor and skins will be a permanent thing I think.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dpc0n5/future_fallout_1st_content_spoilers_abound/

I heart u! Lol
---
Don't want to start a Lore-discussion. There are some YouTube videos or article explaining everything. But I have to correct myself. They've rewritten it.
---
I posted multiple times about this in regards to armor since the chance of any one single piece is around 1 in 240,000.  But I managed to complete a full set of Urban Scout Cham / powered / sneak and even got the exact identical roll once in world and once from the purveyor so anything is possible.
---
Surely though you then end up with legendary gear under max level which is arguably much less valuable?
---
its fun to hack and play with friends
---
I don't know why you keep bringing up the rewards not being east to earn because that's not what I'm saying they should be, this isn't really getting anywhere, but this was a good talk, have a nice holidays
---
Does it drop as a present or the paper bag? Have about 150 thinking about helping out all the new 76er‚Äôs out there

Are there still die hard bethesda fan boys still defending the company after all this shit? Like man I‚Äôve got to hand it to you, You have got to be dumb as fuck to endure this type of service.
---
They are used when you craft armor from Vault 94 to make them Legendary.  You consume a module and receive a random effect on that armor.  It doesn't apply to anything else.  Unfortunately.  It would be kind of an interesting system if it did, since it would allow you to create a Legendary of a specific type of weapon or armor.
---
i never said no one can be lucky, just the game is not fair, i have friends they did same events as me, and did it more times than me, yet i recieved the good rewards, i have friends that played months longer than me yet they were never lucky enough to get certain roles to get, the game it a lottery machine of legendary items, but happy you had the luck on your side, and hope you continue playing and i hope you help others with lesser luck
---
Even if you buy from the atomic shop atoms are free from challeneges. I understand you can actually pay but high majority of people i know do challeneges..also im with the first guy theres been so many other posts about this same topic. If people enjoy the game still why does it really matter? You can ask a similar question about so many other topics. Why do you drive a ford instead of a kia? Why ps4 unstead of xb1 or pc? Im curious to why people wanna know what we get out of this to be honest. I mean personally i hate a lot of other games but i dont ask why everyone is playing that game. Honestly it just comes down to We truly enjoy the game and work through the bugs which seems to be a challenge on its own now days but its really that simple for me. I just like the game and the community
---
Literally because I have friends to play with, and there isn't another multiplayer Fallout yet....so yeah.
---
I really want the nuka girl but can't find it anywhere. I got my husband a mole miner and mothman.
---
i just would like special rewards that ones can grind for, because grinding for a sliver of a chance does get very tiring
---

---
Tenderizer does not work, you get no damage bonus from it.  I can dig up the source if you really want it, or just look at the damage numbers when you hit something consecutively with it equipped (they don‚Äôt change lol). Use those charisma points for lone wanderer or bodyguards since you‚Äôre bloodied, every bit of DR helps.
---
I would also get rid of mister sandman and put those points in something else.  Mister sandman only works at night, so only about 1/2 the time you get the buff.  Better off somewhere else IMO. 
---
Very well done otherwise though!
---
To spite people like you
---
This is technically already possible not only in FO4, but also in this game, the Nuclear Winter mode. I don‚Äôt understand the restriction.
---
People seem to forget that most items in fallout are pre-war and because they were in fallout 4 they think it‚Äôs lore breaking because FO4 takes place so much time after FO76. Like people said the new unstoppables costumes were more breaking because they didn‚Äôt realize all of that is pre-war.
---
They will stay with you as long as you don't use a shower or radway, unless you have level 2 Starched Gene's perk equipped. I keep Starched Gene's equipped 100% of the time so that I don't get mutations that I don't want, and keep the mutations I do want.
---
Really dig it
---
This a PC only exploit. You're highly unlikely to ever see any form of code injection exploit on console due to the sheer amount of effort required to pull it off.
---
I forgot about the desert one. Seen it. I‚Äôm wondering, what will I get if I get a one month sub right now?
---
Couldn't you have looked up, like, the hundreds of other times this was asked?
---
Too funny, you  must have been flying the Vertabird that flew into me, in White Springs earlier. Lol. 
---
I was just coming out of the Enclave Bunker, and  a Virtabird crashed  into the wall in front of the entrance. I am not sure if it got shot down, or if  it was on a collision course.  Nonetheless it was kind of messed up. 
---
I wish you and everyone the best, this holiday season!
---
Boredom really on a night, just to level up. The games controls and the way you move is so fluid for me, it feels better than any other game in those terms. I just run about for an hour or two, buying rare stuff in camps and doing events (which are so ridiculously slow to spawn again these days). However, been crashing and lagging a lot over the past week and especially tonight, so I‚Äôve given up completely. I‚Äôll  be back if Wastlelanders comes about. Only if it brings it new camps items and stuff. So much potential for a game like this, but hasn‚Äôt been handled terribly.
---
I like multiplayer PvE shooters. It's not the only one that I play.
---
I've wanted this as an option for a while.
---
Some people used the gas station signage in creative ways to accomplish this, like using a weapon display board or picture frame to hide the gas prices, and then apply letters over it.
---
But how is it fun? It sounds like hell.
---
Ah thanks for that!
---
Btw as an update, for some reason unplugging my ps4 completely worked. Not restarting, shutting down, resetting router or anything. Just unplugging it. Not sure if you come across this yourself again, but on the small off chance it does, i hope it helps. Thanks again for your input
---
Awesome man.glad to hear that
---
I put a lot of power armor plans in my vending machine. For the relatively common t51b I put most of the parts at 2500 caps, for anything T 45 they're 3750 caps, and for T-60 or Raider they're 5,000 caps.  
---
T51b I seem to have a ton of, at least eight spare plans on top of a full set I'm holding for trades
---
I love it coming up with a good idea and getting down voted because some people don't like an unimportant detail.
---
When u fast travel to a base they often take time to load if you are quick enough u can jump into bases
---
Bro best way i found i put mine outside put a building around it no doors make sure you add a roof. When you wanna check it hit build mode and remove a wall loot then put the wall back all problems solved üëç

I‚Äôve been giving starter supplies and a Holiday Gift to every new player that stops by my shop/home.

Yeah ive done that a lot sometimes im standing there and get trapped when everything else loads in...üòê

Thanks for taking the time on such a lengthy post.lawrenceandhen bailed me out on the launching a nuke mission is was obviously not prepared for.the crappy thing is since then I've obtained some badass weapons and probably could have contributed more to the battle.I think this post should somehow be archived where it could be easily accessed for new players that aren't sure how the battles go. Thanks again
---
Fallout 76 should‚Äôve just been you can play with one other person that‚Äôs it. Just COOP. With NPCs and not a holotape ass story.
---
Not this mess.
---
3 words into google..but nah, lets post on reddit, I might get karma!
---
Well that‚Äôs a bummer!
---
He said the room has no door or window. I think he‚Äôs already using that method.
---
That's exactly how mine is set up.
---
I've come across a legendary sheepsquash in between Camp Ventrue and Dabney homestead 2 or 3 times now.
---
I always do this to try scare the camp owners when they‚Äôre in locked parts of their camps.
---
If it‚Äôs an unimportant detail, then why include it as part of your argument? 
---
What you are referring to actually comes across as a pretty important facet of your idea.
---
Considering it's up 3 flights and "hovering", I don't think it's possible they did this.
---
Well, technically, there's Elder Scrolls Online.
---
I suspect Fallout 76 will ultimately just be an offshoot.  It didn't do well enough, and continues to not catch a break, and they probably have little interest revisiting the idea for the next Fallout game.  Whenever that is.  It's hard for me to believe that they'd actually wait until after Starfield and TES6 to release another entry in the franchise.
---
They have not ‚Äòrewritten‚Äô the lore. They have expanded upon it. 
---
Nothing in Fallout 76 has ‚Äòbroken‚Äô or ‚Äòrewritten‚Äô the existing lore. It has added to it. 
---
That‚Äôs a huge difference.
---
I not sure if anyone had this happen today well doing the SBQ event. My Vats kept going at 100% critical for the whole entire event, till Queen died!? Not sure if was a glitch or intended. 
---
Solid advice, hope to see everyone in the bog. 
---
Inaddion I truly wish you, and everyone the best this holiday season.
---
Crap üò• i totally miss read that sorry everyone!
---
I don't know if it still exists, but I seem to recall hearing something about an unintended exploit with Unyielding where you could get the effects to apply more than once.  Maybe you just stumbled into that by accident.
---
Should have been an up to 4 player coop borderlands style where you can either have your lobby open to the public or private and set to invite only. Enemies level up based on how many players are in game.
---
Because you‚Äôre spreading misinformation. 
---
The clothing idea by itself would be fine. Throwing in your ‚Äòlittle dig‚Äô was disingenuous and that‚Äôs why you got that reaction.
---
That was the most intelligent thing I heard today (maybe it just sound like that because English isn't my mother's tongue) but you're right, it was just a minor argument I used to give my post more content. It would be too short without it.
---
Exactly this. Nothing in the lore has been broken by anything in Fallout 76. 
---
Additions and clarifications are not re-writes or lore-breaks.
---
Many posters have opinions on SBQ damage.
---
I have done at least 50 + SBQ events.
---
Meaning i am well placed to give an opinion.
---
I have failed this event with a dozen high level players including myself present.
---
I have also  completed this event with 1 minute to spare,completing it with just 1 other player present.
---
In my opinion successfully completing  SBQ event can be a bit of a Lottery.I think other factors also decide  SBQ damage parameters[.Like](https://outcome.Like) it being harder to complete if there are too many high level players present at .Also if the event is successfully completed a number of times in a short period of [time.It](https://time.It) is certain SBQ will decide not to land,fly off during at least one event.
---
Dude, I just told you what is available.  I even took screenshots of what is available this very minute.  
---
How hard is it to check the image I put up for you, read the caption, and understand that is the basic and advanced ranger outfits?  
---
They are available NOW, as soon as you pay for a Fallout First subscription, you can claim them in the Atomic Shop.  I cannot possible state it simpler.  You're over-complicating this entire situation by making up your own names and preconceptions on the Ranger outfits.  Just go with what the images say.
---
The quest that you had to go and wait for your turn was so awesome, we were 4 friends and we had to wait for 4 different NPCs back then, was so fun.  
---
Also the excavator quest was awesome, i really wanted to do more in that place but there's not anything ;(
---
I sold a ghoul slayer's pipe wrench to a level 1011 player a couple of weeks ago. I figured by the time you get to that level your just looking for silly things to do.
---
Had a weird bug today with my armour, for some reason it stacked my power armor stats on top of my vanguard BoS stats, so outside of PA i had something like 1k DR/ER lol
---
Was sad to see if go once i reloghed tho xd
---
Hey I have a idea what If instead of getting mad at a post and posting a bitchy comment you just downvoted the post and moved on
---
The Behemoth to the West of Twin Lakes is always level 50 and occasionally legendary. He will respawn each time a new toon comes into his proximity. I've camped there for a while and his drop is 15-25 caps, weapons, armor, ammo and junk. I've learned a lot of the mods (weapons and armor) and generally get one or two 300+ cap value guns to sell (nets about 80-100 caps per gun at the vendors). Worth a stop if you see a camp in that area to farm him.
---
Has fo76 ever been marketed as a single player game, and at launch, were you able to play by yourself? The skeleton of its design, and the game it came from, does not change the facts of the marketing intent
---
All these companies try multiplayer and fail but they never give us what we actually asked for. The exact same game with a friend or three
---
I need more fallout pop figures all I have is a nate in combat armor with a nuka cola
---
Adrenaline 1 not 5, the points should go towards endurance, fireproof and adamant skeleton. Your DPS falls down when you die.
---
Four leaf clover instead of grim reapers spirit.
---
You can mod -25% legendary ballistic rifles to use 0 AP per shot. That puts regenerating the AP for shooting out of the question, so you can concentrate on critical hit frequency and actual DPS.
---
If the rifles standard receiver is semi, it's auto receiver will consume 50% less AP. Forceful stock, aligned barrels, and quick reload magazines each reduce the AP cost by 5%. Dot sights is 10% reduction, combined, it's 75% reduction from craftable mods and with 25%-less legendary mod it's flat 0.

---
What am I winning?
---
Explain that to me
---
What do you play on?
---
The private servers are clutch for transferring items between characters, and sometimes its nice to drop a nuke and have all the mobs to yourself, but I still play on public at least 80% of the time.
---
I still refuse to play a game that is all multiplayer. I hate it. I hate that as a solitary gamer I am continually shit on by these companies that put out games with good plot and whatnot except oops, you can't play it unless you're online with other people!
---
I'd play FO76 - if it was single player.
---
I'd play WoW - if it was single player.
---
I don't have the friends or the data cap for online play.
---
SmmothHC. I'll be on most of the day
---
I always give away plans and ballistic ammo for free in my vendors
---
I've never played FO76, but am a huge fan of the series. I first got into Fallout by playing Fallout 3 on Xbox 360 and have played them all since (other than this one). Even though this game has had its issues, and with the current hackers going around, it has been nice to see a positive community remain here. If you have any Xbox keys left, I certainly wouldn't mind jumping in and contributing to the positivity. I'm also interested to see how the Wastelanders expansion goes as well.
---
With new bugesda mess you can buy it from players so find someone and buy it
---
They need to fix the current game, any issues with fo1st,  and any issues with wastelanders before they take on any other tasks. And  I dont see the first two happening anytime soon.
---
I‚Äôm a Free States turned Raider. I do what I want.
---
I‚Äôm low level but I want new friends in this too. My gamer tag is MurdaBoyManny
---
They could implement what Fable 3 did. You can see other players orbs if toggled ON and can join their world.
---
You can?
---
&gt; but I expected more mini-DLC style quests to obtains unique functional items like a collectron.
---
I 100% agree on this. The base model fridge and collectron should have been obtainable via a quest of some sort, and then fill the Atom Shop with assorted skins for those who want them.
---
Also, I would gladly pay some atoms for "voice packs" that would add to his dialogue. It's funny at first, but since there's only like 25 lines it gets old after a while.
---
Yes you can craft ton of them and sell or drop
---
Don‚Äôt tell me how to live my life.
---
I've never got one of those before but I need one now
---
&gt;Personally I find costumes from games set years later 
---
If you're talking about the ranger armor, that was actually prewar gear that was adopted by the NCR, so it's not really a stretch to believe that other riot cops across the country would have similar clothing and equipment.
---
The toxic lakebed just north of the Clarksburg shooting range often spawns a mirelurk queen (but sometimes it's a Snallygaster)
---
Supposedly, the top two rewards don't have the Atomic Shop flag on them.
---
Excuses
---
That‚Äôs the point.
---
GT Swiss4rmyCheese, level 70, about to hit 71
---
Sometimes it loads in weird, with marsupial and strange with friends players can jump super high. There is also a way players can glitch through doors unless that has been patched.
---
It's not that difficult. You can buy them from the players. Doesnt has that atomic icon on them so they can mass produce.
---
When you tell them you still enjoy the game despite its problems.
---
The abuse gets worse.:-)
---
Triggered much.
---
Heavy bos combat or scout
---
I only have one character and have yet to drop a nuke, so none of that really means much to me. I get that it can be great for other people, but for me, public servers are fine. Only advantage private servers might give me is some stability, but stability in a game is something that absolutely should not be pay walled.
---
Market 76 won‚Äôt let you trade those items do you know anyone who would sell it to me.
---
No answer.
---
Fucking shocker....
---
With my hour total I feel like that's where I could be if I prioritized XP buffs and maybe focused more on double XP events and such.
---
Definitely nowhere near 500-1000
---
He's saying different dev's on different games if I recall zenimax was steering the  ship on most of the fallout games we know in love this time Bethesda was like fuck you I can do this myself and decided they wanted to drive the boat and used some shity company they bought out and fucked it up. Feel free to correct me
---
&gt;  A lot of people lost a lot of money because of this, the least you could do is let those players buy all their stuff back for a reasonable price
---
Hi everyone,
---
we fucked up and your stuff is gone. But on the bright side, you can pay us more to get it back! Thank you very much.
---
Sorry, I meant the plans. Finding the actual armor pieces isn't really a problem.
---
See though, what people, in general, were actually asking for was a co-op Fallout. I want to play the game with my friends. I don't want to play with a bunch of random morons like it's Fortnite.
---
I wAnT a SlIgHt AtTeMpT aT lOrE cOnSiStEnCy
---
Bffr what?

they could probably do some rad cult themed stuff, and just not feature any of the children of atom emblems or art
---
OP writes about primarily how great the *community* is, and here comes Hippo name calling and saying he‚Äôs a shill for having an *opinion*. Real nice! Good holiday spirit!
---
Im so sorry handmade
---
Overall a set of Heavy Combat gives the best balance between Damage Resist and Energy Resist, it beats out Scout because the Scout Armor chest piece only has 55 Energy Resist. 
---
The best overall balance including a backpack is a Heavy Combat chest and 4 Heavy Leather limbs with the armor plated backpack. It's the only setup where you have over 300 DR/ER from just gear.
---
Here is a link I use, it has all the values for every type of armor in the game as well as suggestions for different sets. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17NwpXnPBzeT4Gd--3qi-ejEC46--48qtbbQdDyZrGOQ/htmlview
---
Just walk down the hill and find the creator, I spend a lot of time at the creator, it is a random spawn, spawns super mutants, deathclaws, sheepsquatches, fog crawlers etc .. if you spawn into the freak show, turn left and walk thru the forest until you hit the creator .. I don't bother with the freak show too much, but a neat location ..
---
Bloodied faster fire rate what? Handmade, fixer?

At your camp place a wall and use letters to spell what you want. Eventually someone we ill see it and msg u.

Cool. I just need a torso and right arm. If you're on PC I'll come buy one day in the new year.

I get that standard and advanced are currently available to all. I am just unsure about the riot paint, as that was initially limited time. I apologize for the confusion.
---
Soz I might be a bit late to this but my GT is HXCmate. I am always looking for people to play 76 with!

Don't you ultimately play it because you find it fun?

This moth man effigy is located in the basement of a house just above Wilson‚Äôs Auto, in the forest. It‚Äôs a Fast Travel, and easy to find on the map. For whatever reason, you can fit the entire house and the auto shop into your camp placement.
---
Yes, it has been dropping from the scorched Christmas event.
---
Bethesda on ww2: "don't worry,  just a few people were harmed"
---
Good call, it was slow at work the other day and I listened to the whole Chad series.
---
That is awesome!
---
Oh I found the obligatory asshole. I scrolled down looking for them. Really thought we'd luck out on this one.
---
Smaller objects like rocks &amp; trees  can be removed by building something on them. 
---
In my C.A.M.P at The Whitespring, I removed the trees and bushes I didn't like clipping inside. They have been replaced with Jack-o-lanterns and death claw Easter eggs.
---
Good joke bro.its anything except fun
---
It's part of the xmas event, but it still isn't a common drop. You got a great deal on that one.
---
They are not marked at Atomic Shop items so they are sellable/tradeable.
---
It still sounds shitty, I know, but that seems like the most likely thing they would do apart from giving everyone another 500 atoms.
---
Merry Christmas guy.  A shame this brings you no joy.  May your 2020 bring brighter things.
---
MADNESS 
---
Seriously tho. I thought the same thing months ago when they cut the amount of caps you got from player kills in survival. Sweaties were asking what was even the point of playing then and I thought, well, I mean it's a game. Isn't it fun? Isn't that why we're here?
---
Y'all still on this sinking ship?
---
This game should be a learning experience for Bethesda, so that they fully put their focus on "Player 1". This MMO PVP shit along with the completely non-canon content of Fallout 76 needs to be consigned to the garbage can of Fallout history. If the focus had been on (as others have said here) for Co-op it would have been so much better.
---
Just imagine what Fallout 76 could have been if Bethesda had taken the time to add NPC's, scripted quests and a definitive gripping story that could be played solo or as a cooperative experience. Such a missed opportunity, it makes me feel sick when I think about all of the dev time spent on this turd pushing the franchise further in the wrong direction.
---
I had no idea it looked that good. I actually learned about it today when I saw the back of my excavator armor pop
---
The real solution at this point to all this is to just lock the game behind streaming services such as Geforce Now or Stadia. The former already has the game as part of the service.
---
Since you won't have access to new versions of the files and the entire installation of the game becomes a paperweight afterwards, hackers can't find ways to inject inventory stealing tools and NPC spawn tools anymore.
---
I haven't bought it and never will, I'm simply providing advice to people who like to continue to get crapped on by Bethesda. Stop being a sheep and supporting a company who doesn't give two shits about fixing the game for it's player base.
---
Ive never seen a 900+ and ive played 1250 hours.  Im a level 340.  Thats 4 hours a day since launch
---
Still me
---
Same guys, literally the only one I have
---
I can sympathize. I hit the grind during the Halloween stuff and unlocked everything but I just don't have it in me this time around. But I get why they did it, it's supposed to be a prestige thing. But they screwed up and made it so you can just buy the top rewards from another player lol
---
PKOA are one of those that help out regardless
---
Whenever I see a low level or a new one (make sure to confirm they are new by checking trophies) and any low level Legendaries that I've got stored, any spare resources etc that i can spare, I'll give it to them, the amount of Fusion Generators I must've given away, Radiation suits, Rad-X, Radaway, Stims, ammo whatever I've given a lucky player it
---
I'm not even level 100 on my main and it's my only character
---
It's either the Power armor trick or someone went inside while your camp was still loading might be even both.
---
I'd personally love it that was the idea going forward. It would be a good way for people to grind to make caps of things in game.
---
I‚Äôm teaching them valuable life lessons and murdering anyone at a workshop
---
I dono man. I have Instigating Explosive pipe Revolver and lever.  The lever hits 1500 headshot no extra food or drug buffs. The revolver 800ish, even with pistol cards added.
---
You can build camp in NW.......
---
Anyone can place a camp module and use blueprints. Not sure what you mean by weapons tho
---
It's surprisingly easy if you can consistently remember to craft and consume XP boosting aid items and sleep. I have a character close to lvl 500 and 2 characters that are both close to lvl 200. If all of that would have been spent on one character it would be one of those crazy high lvl's people are enamored with.
---
Talk about fucking pathetic.
---
Hahahahaha holy fuck.
---
Good to know.
---
Now to find someone on PS4 who wants 1k
---
With the recent news of hacks I just wanted to laugh at the fateful.
---
The only thing that has happened after fallout 1st, iirc, was the holiday scorch event and santatron. 
---
What is unique about the event is there are so many low level legendaries.
---
Kind of a double edged sword but normally you only find level 30 and above legendary weapon and have to wait to use them. 
---
If you go to the airport, there is a chance you can walk away with numerous legendary weapons and armor.
---
In terms of improvements since FO1st, nothing... It has been so recent, they are probably counting the bits.
---
Was on a team two times with a guy in a row, he could make a camp but he also dumped a bunch of weapons. It was right at the start, i spawned right next to him, he didnt gather anything. I mean it was great, but giving me a 50 cal and treched in a camp, blasting anyone who enters the doorway. It takes the spirit out of the game
---
woah wall of text batman.
---
What social media? I don't see them posting it here? Are you talking about something else?
---
As far as people being mad at you because you killed them you will get no sympathy from me there at all. They may be slinging insults, but that is only because that is all you have left them with. 
---
I don't mind PVP personally, but if all you are doing is ganking random people in a workshop you deserve every word of scorn from those whom you ganked. It wasn't like it was a fair fight anyway, and you know it. 
---
Honestly man, you're exactly the kind of person that is enabling the worst parts of the community. You've espoused that it is the victims fault on more than one occasion, to both excuse your own shitty choices and the actions of the hackers. 
---
I really think you need to step back and think about the morality of the choices you have made instead of blaming people who really want no part in what you have chosen as your own path in the game.
---
3 words. AINT. GONNA. HAPPEN.
---
It would be nice, but the C.A.M.P. system in 76 is already leagued beyond the stock system of Fallout 4 (not talking about mods). So in their eyes they have already done a complete rework. And let's face it, this is Bethesda we are talking about. We definately wont be getting a rework in 76, perhaps in Fallout 5 we will be a better CAMP system and they will improve upon what they have made in 76.
---
ESP is our only option.  üòÅ
---
The development team was the group that decided on this particular course of action. I'm sure there was a memo informing them that the higher ups want something put in to make it easier for people to get to the atomic shop, but this is how they chose to go about it.
---
You returning for something so petty brings far more laughter to others, I guarantee
---
You describe things you want in an online Fallout game...but you refuse to accept the fact that was already have what you're describing. Sort yourself out, bud.  Hey, maybe some people should start making mods for Skyrim. Or maybe someone should make a battle royale game, that would be sweet.
---
Ok.........
---
I confess my tone may have come off harsher than I intended, but those are the same numbers I get with a bloodied explosive pipe-revolver on a VATS head shot as well...  If I chose to buff or activate Crits, it goes even higher.  I suppose it just depends on subjective experience, or maybe build and modding preferences.  Let's both agree to say that we have different results, but neither of us is necessarily wrong.
---
10-4, good buddy.

Me returning during the boring slows of the holiday season after learning Bethesda fucked you again is me flicking your ear. You responding butt-hurt is the joke

I really don't think you're being fair to Jon. He genuinely wants 76 to do well, and he actually plays it quite often. He makes mistakes yes, don't we all?
---
It's not like continuity or canon matters in these games anymore dude. They've stretched it beyond the breaking point so why don't you relax. 
---
Me, I want a Reilly's Rangers pack lol
---
Ok so tell me how to do it too
---
??
---
You cannot sell atom shop items or trade them. NW items are atom shop items.
---
How? Is it a perk? I press select and i cant place a camp? I can build once someone else lays down
---
Too low level to maintain the mutation I think. Starched genes isn't till a lot later.
---
You can drop the beanie and trade it and apparently it‚Äôs the same for winter clothes. My friend gave me like 5 or 6 beanies
---
Get a few non-perishable food items. Don't eat them.
---
Then kill some creatures and cook them (pretty much anything that isn't a robot can be eaten). Survive on this new meat and then eat your non-perishables only if you run out and haven't been able to re-stock on meat.
---
You can also cook soups instead of using meat of you prefer, grow some corn at your CAMP and make some soup. I prefer using meat so that I don't need boiled water.
---
Its ok they will bring it back for 2 hours randomly at double price but only in a bundle with 1500 atoms worth of junk.
---
It‚Äôs not a perk. Maybe your camp is too close to someone else‚Äôs camp but I had no trouble placing camps down
---
Fatalairstrike level 40ish on my new build I play fairly often

I don't have a mic to talk to you. But what kind of weapons do you like?
---
Gamer tag?
---
Are you sure it's not completing and just not showing on the screen ? That happens to me ALL the time. Like I will finish an event, fast travel to another, finish that one, and it will show me the rewards of the first... 
---
I am stuck on the daily Play time. It says to turn in my daily by talking to her and she's just not into it. Not acknowledging I'm done.
---
The actual advice could be don't drink Nukashine haha quite risky to drink that in the wasteland
---
A little under half a year ago i found his one dude and at that point i had learned just about everything they had in the game plans-wise, so i built this one newer guy a full camp free of charge- some of my best work too:) Speaking of which my absolute favorite pastime in the game is designing camps, and I know tons of really neat spots- I‚Äôm on xbox, and if anyone out there wants my help with building camps just let me know! If enough people ask i can try and post some pictures of my previous works!
---
The lore is already wack. Just let a man have his fun.
---
I mean all I've been using is that bolt action rifle. I think it has around 60 damage. Preferable a melee, a close range and a long range weapon would be great.
---
Well shit. I've opened at least 500 gifts and only got one.
---
No, I have the quest marked on my pipboy, and it never goes away, even after I analyzed the sample
---
Stay strong mate! Need anything in game, want to hang out in a private without interaction required just say so I'd be pleased to let you in or anybody that wants to go in a private place but not alone exactly. The feeling of someone else being somehow "close" or there is always good, but sometime Public feels "too much" so there's this middle ground. I'm intrigued about this community I'm going to take a look at it, feel it might be interesting to me :D  
---
Merry christmas to you as well and everybody here.
---
Im ploj122 ingame, keep a lookout for when i‚Äôm on and i‚Äôll gladly play with you! I‚Äôm about lvl 98 or such for frame of reference
---
Well I did spend about 90k caps when it first came out trying to lighten my caps load. It worked lol.
---
Much less rare.
---
Thank you
---
Very grateful
---
Equal trade for an order 9f won to n and shrimp flied lice.
---
It will load players camps in pieces so its possible something like the stairs loaded before the walls.
---
I've had the event pop up again, shortly after completing it. It did what you described to me on the second attempt. There may not have been enough time between your last hunt completion.
---
Please delete this post. Thanks.
---
Lucky bastard
---
Is there a chance one of you sent a nasty pm to someone? If you get comms banned on xbox, it prevents team formation last I had heard.
---
No, it was flatwoods in the middle of the road, i spawned right next to him. He went straight to building and i kept trying to give him a rifle, then he dumped a bunch of weapons. Whatever. Must be a glitch like how people were going underground in morgantown and no one knew what the people were talking about.
---
üíù‚úä thank you, same to you. We arw all in this together
---
Added you but don't rush, we can set a time whenever we're both ready. Thank you.
---
BeThEsDa BaD though
---
(But they seriously need to ban some people, as a sidenote)
---
get a teamate that has that mission to kill the crypted then you will extract the sample from that it will act like nothing happened but it will let you deposit the sample and clear the mission ( i had this same bug ) and found this solution on another post and worked for me
---
Even after selling 3 I‚Äôm still at a loss in caps
---
Damn..
---
Super duper doesn't pop for this. Chemist does craft 2 though instead of one. Large and medium have the chance of cap and scrip..so get medium too. Small is worthless imo. I hit max cap and buy the serum plans usually. They weigh very little and are worth at least 18k each but I sell them at a loss 8 or 9 k usually in my venders. Nice to be able to put so many high priced items in my vender knowing that no one has the caps to buy them : )
---
Bout fihteen minute.
---
I saw a dense robot torso chest plan 500 caps at a player vendor. People don't know how rare these plans have been. But i hope these plans become more available
---
fully agree with your reasoning.. a cap on caps is ridiculous.
---
GT: Mr Hox182
---
I usually hop on every day after work for a bit.
---
Not sure why you were down voted.  I earned the last reward yesterday morning and saw it was traceable.  I didn‚Äôt want to sell them out of principle, but I‚Äôm seeing players selling them from as low as 3k up to 25k each.
---
Yeah my stats on my bloody guy have been through the roof since that armor bug a few weeks ago. Every stat is way more than it should be. I‚Äôm not complaining at all
---
Great advice.. Thanks much.
---
Grab em while you can lol
---
Perfect solution.  I'm going to get moving on this asap!!
---
I'm EST time, i'll add you when I get home! I'm on pretty often and I will be on tonight probably
---
Please add one: Do not join if you are under lv50. You deal no damage while SBQ becomes tougher.
---
Wait why the hell is is in Japanese I forgot how to spell tomahawk so I voiced it
---
This is PS4
---
happened to me a couple times today. not sure how it gets triggered
---
I went to a lower level player‚Äôs CAMP once and dropped a bunch of plans for them. They gave me the thumbs up after taking them, so I then dropped a couple of serums, and they got stoked.
---
Fair point. 10k Tesla it is, then.
---
Thanks friend. Maybe we'll get a new Vegas remaster üí¶üí¶üí¶

GT is ImSomewhatWeird. I work a lot but when I have off I play 76 a ton. I would be more than happy to play with you when possible.
---
6k
---
I'm not in the least bit interested in your opinion, SerratedGoat. You've been on my blocked list since all that ridiculous nonsense went on with the stupid kingdom of Gadlantis horse shit. what a nightmare
---
Not a bad idea, but to be honest I'm still waiting for Brotherhood of Steel and Enclave stuff first. I've been for a year now with the same BoS clan and I'm dying to decor my CAMP with BoS stuff.
---
Try nukacrypt.com
---
VERY NAUGHTY
---
Still better the fo4. Whoever wrote that game must of had a stroke.
---
Really?
---
Well shit. I‚Äôll just craft ‚Äòme and sell them cheap so my PvE fellow dwellers don‚Äôt have to slog through NW just to get it. (Same with the winter coat when I finish unlocking it.)
---
[https://youtu.be/Kddzyds4fGo?t=21](https://youtu.be/Kddzyds4fGo?t=21)
---
As far as I know, you can't.  I believe the picture is misleading.  When I've mentioned it in the past, no one has corrected me and said "Oh, you can do that if you XYZ."
---
So it's just a normal plan?
---
That‚Äôs asinine. I‚Äôm going to sell them for 100 caps each just to floor the market.
---
Wow thank you so much for the write up! Lots of useful info. 1 point into Adrenaline does make quite a bit of sense. 
---
Any feedback on the evasive perk?
---
Nothing :(((
---
I'm pretty sure the ones on Nuka-Crypt right now are the nuke codes, because Bravo's looks different from what I used yesterday and people have launched nukes throughout the day.
---
For whatever reason, Nuka-Crypt's "Week of" text doesn't seem to update when the numbers do.
---
Hey, no problem. I also have a few stim packs I'm gonna give you and I'll mod the stuff I give you also.
---
Nothing :((
---
It could be like GTA5, an offline single player mode like Fallout 4/3/NV and a separate online mode. Worked pretty good for Rockstar.
---
My psn is brandnewzo. I‚Äôll be on at some point tonight!
---
i agree
---
Thank you so much! Just lmk. What level are you?
---
I sit and afk in my base, and when people come to the nearby event, I stop by and hand out gifts. It's really wholesome, and people often give other gifts in return. I love this community.
---
The date is wrong...I used alpha code just a couple of hours ago to complete atom challenge
---
I have a Berserkers Laser Pistol, Exterminators Meathook, Zealots Axe. You can have them all or whatever ones you want.
---
Then why play it?  I don't find that style of gameplay fun, so I don't.  This is a game meant to be fun, if it isn't don't.
---
Yeah so I'mma need details. Until it wasn't??
---
If you have excavator, use that at lucky hole for much higher yields.  And put on scrapper when you break down weapons.
---
Could you translate for non programming savvy folks?
---
Because I like rewards.the only reason
---
Happy cake day, and thanks for the advice, I am trying to get better but I mean I'm already doing pretty well
---
I'd say you're missing a key factor that makes getting a specific set of legendary perks even harder...  Server pools.  Not only do you have frankly insane number of combinations, weighted heavily towards "junk" affects such as bashing damage, You have to be on a server that's even DROPPING all three affects you want on gear at all.

I gave mine I little repaint. I was really happy to find it.

Wow, that's a really great looking Wise Mothman!! Good work!
---
The 25k defiantly is.  3k to save days of playing if it‚Äôs not someone‚Äôs thing seemed reasonable.  I‚Äôm just hoping they let these stay trade-able and give the players who legit earned it a non trade able flow in the dark version.
---
PM sent.
---
This is untrue as the queen does NOT level according to levels of players or number present, any help with the queen is good, be it doing damage, mopping up mobs, revving players etc, the Queen is supposed to a group effort. My $.02

Saimeatlegs is my GT, feel free to add me

Thanks! It has a great sculpt that was kinda lost on the base paint.

That‚Äôs adorable :D

And what about broke folks or people who wouldn't buy from it anyway

I would love to have them all. That'll be amazing. Thank you!
---
Do you know what would be even nicer. If the game wasn‚Äôt shit
---
There yours then, I also have 3 or 4 pieces of legendary armor for you
---
Are you on Xbox? I‚Äôd be happy to buy a hat and outfit
---
Still not giving credit as of 26th dec 2019..
---
It should become a co-op series with an offline mode that people can still freely mod
---
Nice!!
---
Good post and good info! Never been able to completely nail down the amount of damage needed to have 'tagged' the queen for loot, but some informal tests and anecdotal evidence seems to put it at around 1% of her hp. Which would be in the 300-400 range.
---
I think it‚Äôs more to strengthen their end of the year numbers.  By making it so players play an extra 27-100+ NW matches, they can say a much higher amount of matches played for the year, and a much higher amount of time spent overall in that mode.  I got the final reward yesterday morning, and wish I would have known they were trade able .  Even with my average game exp being 500-1100 it still took  a lot of matches.
---
After last week I wonder if there are any new players.
---
I'm level 161, but also play with my son a lot. He's a level 9. Lol. What time will you be on tomorrow?
---
https://youtu.be/FM6OBfb2ROk
---
Not in English but I guess the code is good.
---
I saw one of them yesterday, was heading to Berkley Springs Station and hovered over them and was like wtf but they were gone by the time I loaded in.
---
As a devoted follower of mothman, I really fucking need this.
---
Once you get the reward, it‚Äôs unlocked for all of your characters to craft.  Due to the beanie and coat not getting the atomic shop suffix (which makes things non trade able), they didn‚Äôt get it and can be traded and sold by those that unlocked it.
---
All I want is the goddam travel mat from workshops to be available in personal camps.
---
My camp hangs off a section of monorail line and is accessible via the cliff next to it.
---
Half the time ya spawn in you're either at the bottom of the cliff or clipped inside a rock. 
---
I've moved my little camp projector probably a hundred times trying to fix this but there just isn't a great spot inside the build radius.
---
that's not true, fallout 1st is a priority to them but just barely
---
I hope this kind of post keep me up to date.
---
I hope u find some help, I'm on PC so can't help :(
---
Well I live in Hawaii so idk what the time difference is
---
Wow 161 is crazy. Im only 26 and had the game since release
---
nukacrypt
---
Just want to say this is by far my favorite community ever! Very grateful to be a part of it.
---
Yea, that's what I normally use. But the site isn't updated
---
Damn. What perks do you use with it?
---
the codes worked for me
---
When 76 first came out, you could make obscene amounts of XP by farming glowing ghouls in nuked Whitesprings, and since there wasn't really much else to do as an endgame, that's what we did every night. They ended up lowering the XP gained from those ghouls, but before they did, some of us were already way ahead in levels. These days, taking advantage of double XP weekends is the way to go. Someone posted a guide a few weeks back to show the way they do it.
---
Edit: just found them in another Reddit post. Yes, the site isn't updated for me. It still shows the 17th to 24th for me. I refreshed it like 10 times
---
The CAMP system has some wtf meachics.
---
260, 115, 50 and I have under 800 hours. At launch xp came in by the truckload, it has been heavily nerfed across the board. 1-50 in a weekend was easy just tagging ghouls in whitesprings
---
I actually live in West Virginia, so I'm on east coast time. It's taken a lot of hours, lol. I thought you were lower than 26. The weapons I told you about are level 5. I have a nice Explosive Lever Action I'll give you though to match your level, it's a level 25. Your still more than welcome to have the level 5 ones still too.
---
Is there a way to track hours?  I'd be interested in how much I have.
---
I personally will down a player a lot and tell my team NOT to kill the downed player to try and ‚Äúbait‚Äù the rest of their team out. Getting assist XP would be nice, considering most of the time people will ignore my suggestion just to take the kill XP.
---
DeafGrapes38. I'm a solo guy but if you ever wanna do events or need some help/resources let me know.
---
Thanks everyone, would have thanked earlier.  Thought i got alerts but i guess not.
---
PC, unfortunately
---
My heart goes out to you brother. Sorry my man. Best of luck for the new year.
---
Dang. Gotta keep grinding away I guess lol
---
I gave up on the camp  thing a  few weeks after Beta.   I stick to  a fairly basic design and for me it's just to store and repair stuff.    To people who really care about what your camp looks like and put serious though into it- well I don't know how you do it. 
---
It would drive me insane.
---
Don't tell anyone. Fallout fans will be lurking...
---
You can
---
&gt;Yeah, I don't like rolling around with that perk all the time personally, but I do throw it on when I'm repairing my armor,
---
Cheaper repairs is only half the function of it.  The other half is much slower armor breakage. If you don't run with it equipped then your armor will break fast.  I run with it on at all times, and repair the armor to 200 percent with fix it good and I really don't have any problems.
---
JamsBong007 - play later in the evening on PST, lvl 64 and always share my inspiration card (bonus xp when part of a team)!
---
I enjoy that you have a favorite mole miner
---
You know what, this makes sense. I never think anything through, my apologies for wasting your time with this post
---
I've never launched a Nuke. Can you just use the code and go fire one off?
---
Try to pick a camp spot where it's off the beaten path. Less likely to run into issues there.
---
You need a nuke card still, but don't need the code pieces if you get the codes online
---
Sort of. I've done about 500+ Queen Fights. I do about 10 a day. Give or take 1-2.    
---
I havn't lost a Queen in a long long time.   
---
Part of it though is def a balance as you said. I'm unarmed melee. I need the Queen to land and not in a nuke zone. Dmg numbers show that I'm doing 12k a hit, but I know that with her DR I'm probably doing about 1-2k a hit.  That said, every hit by me, her health goes down visibly by about 1%-3%.   
---
Being bloodied\\unyielding though means I do about 3 times a fight from either radiation or ads.  I need my heavy weapon bros\\gals to hold her aggro for me to do my thing. I need her to be crippled thanks to my snipers taking our her legs and wings.   
---
Its a team sport. I bet my heavy weapon bros\\gals end up doing similar damage numbers when totaled up when compared to my massive hits.   
---
Thats why I love newbs being in the SBQ- the more people taking aggro means the more I am able to smack the Queen herself. 
---
I can solo her, but it takes me about 20 minutes and cuts really close to the timer. Most of the time wasted from her flying off and the other high health builds need me for the burst damage.   
---
Typically, the SBQ on my servers are done in about 4-6 minutes, I'd say 95% of the time. And as I said, I do somewhere around 8-10 Queens a day.
---
Yeah, I spend a few dollars a month on atoms. But no crazy amounts, lol. I'll tell you Point Pleasant is real and one of the coolest places in WV.
---
My handmade lasts forever. My combat shotty breaks like a twig.
---
I'm at about a thousand hours and I've seen a few. :shrug: don't know what to tell you. 
---
There are people who do pretty much nothing but farm events/legendary spawn zones and that gets a lot more XP than people who do a lot of base building and etc.
---
...and to think my character is holding hundreds of those.
---
It is! Good on you for ignoring all the anger from people most of whom have never even played it
---
All three rifleman, mac covert ops, max sneak, and max mister sandman.At night it tops around 2500. Daytime with sneak it still gets 1500-1600
---
Anything that ignores a *good* percentage of incoming damage *before* it hits your armor will be more effective than adding the extra DR/ER to your armor with perks. There's also a formula for working out actual damage dealt based on the Fallout 4 model (which Fallout 76 is supposed to use) so you could even do some calculations yourself ([https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)). 
---
Lone Wanderer 3 or 4 (20% reduction of incoming damage) under Charisma is really good, along with Serendipity 3 (which you already have). Evasive 3 which adds a max of 45 DR/ER isn't that great in comparison.
---
sporadic posts on the sub, could be nerves, could be lies, but the claims are still made and beths willingness to downplay the original situation means its in the realm of possibility. Also the hack can still give items you can't say a grieffer can't find a creative way to cause trouble with that
---
Sure, add me. GT is Rusynlancer. I also run with Fallout 1st.
---
chrisXhorrorshow. I'll be on over the holiday break
---
They're supposed to be locked to your account, but Bethesda messed up. The data miners confirmed that they are indeed Atom-locked by design.
---
I love this!  As much as folks hate, hearing this makes me encouraged that the community spirit that started at launch is still beating strong!
---
Wow since playing the game I've been wanting to travel to west Virginia. Seems beautiful
---
NGL...  I would love this to be a Jukebox option.
---
No problem! There are not many events in this game that bring people together quiet like this and I think this game truly shines through its community. I hope this helps spark some interest and cooperation for newer players and older ones to come together. I really hope Bethesda comes out with more events like these that we can initiate at will.
---
I like having Sundew Grove in the Blast Zone.  Lots of NPC's in their carrying flux precursors (Glowing &amp; Hardened Mass and HRF) and the only place around Watoga you can gather Fluorescent Flux, generally 30-40.  Love fighting the SQB at V9 and then heading over to the Grove.  After cleaning out the Grove head for every man made structure in the Zone and the Fissures to kill more NPCs for  flux precursors.  If there are Ultracite Veins harvest them one by one to bring waves of more NPCs with flux precursors.
---
Word of caution, you need to be fairly high level with good PA, Prime weapons and a fair amount of Rad X, Radaway and healing chems or Nukas.
---
You have to be on same world to invite to team.
---
yes indeed, and merry christmas!
---
It‚Äôs such an interesting concept that continues to become more possible as time goes on I think.
---
Do you have Alpha Codes?
---
Been playing with my brother since launch. Launching our first nuke and killing our first SBQ were extremely gratifying experiences (though they took far longer than either of us had anticipated...)
---
Tentatively excited (oxymoron much?) for Wastelanders!
---
I've been playing for a little over a month and have been amazed at how great the community is! I play on xbox and have seen some toxic online communities, but I've had strangers message me with offers of free items, I find bags of goodies by the vendors all the time, as well as bunches of plans dropped for me when visiting other bases!
---
Yes
---
This. Use a character under level 5 for smallest loot pool.
---
If the only reason you are playing nw is for the outfit, you need to reevaluate your priorities. 
---
I play because it's fun.  If i get an outfit that's well and good.
---
No problem! I hope this saves you time and resources so you can spend more time enjoying the friends you play with or optimizing your builds!
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm not quite sure I have not ran into that vat bug yet.
---
This is all I ever wanted!
---
Holy shit dude, find a new post

VM&gt;HARDWARE&gt;ISP&gt;falloutserver

---
Congratulations
---
Would one of us get a notification if we were comma banned?
---
I wonder if there will be repercussions to having one without earning it?
---
I have posted and credited data miners that have proved that the queen does not stack depending on players present. She is the same every time. What can determine the difference between success and fail is how long she spends in the air and the dps the present players can do. This is why I described the best locations to fight with the tools to use and the mistakes to avoid. Basically fight outside the nuke zone on flat ground while sticking together and avoiding using explosives so she does not attempt to dodge. Do not critical hit her so she does not stagger while in the air to make her land faster and if you can not do the damage to kill her cover the the players that can with crowd control.
---
This is false and I specifically mentioned this misconception.
---
I think you are close but I am not entirely sure the exact % like you. Another poster mentioned around 1500 dmg which feels right for the amount of SBQ events I have done but I cannot be precise.
---
Hackers? More like beta testers -Demure
---
Ah I see, thanks for sharing!
---
It would be difficult to those who don't know the difference between to, too, and two. 2bad4u

Still on?
---
It was in the last hot fix you can no longer repair weapons at workbenches, now it‚Äôs repair kits only....or you can repair them for free from your survival tent via direct deposit to Todd Howard for 300% condition
---
Yea but I move around 15 to 20 times...
---
Well, to answer your question, maybe people play it because they are having fun.
---
I've seen plenty of honest suggestions here get turned into paid crap. Wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if it happened with this.
---
14k is a little overkill, especially as it‚Äôs the last reward and it‚Äôs available while a lot of people are traveling for the holidays.
---
I only got a few matches in once the coat was unlocked, and now I‚Äôm away from home until Friday. I will be able to get the last unlock by the 6th, but it means unnecessary grinding due to losing four days of available play time.
---
You should just try a new world
---
I want an offer option, if I have 10 guns on display I may sell them but want people to be able to offer. Could be caps + script and other items.
---
Well, the entire house is a reference to that movie.
---
I think he finally gave up, no worries.  Thx though.
---
I have a hard time getting this guy to stand on his own. Found he leans best against my Fallout Lunchbox!
---
If you see a giant three story platform camp near V9, please do yourself and everyone a favor and come to the top of the platform. You can fight the Queen and not have to deal with all the ground Scorched.
---
Thats the point.
---
Give me all the vault raid rewards without having to do the raids, too, while they're at it.
---
Yeah theres a specific sequence of events you can do with unyeilding to quantify the stat boosting. This was months ago when I still played but I hear it still works. My stats generally sat around 30-50s using it. With drugs...? Hahah. Bloody unyeilding melee is hilarious dps.
---
Yes, I got at least 5 (maybe more) from around 100 various gifts unwrapping with a below 5 lvl character. When unwrapping using high level i got NONE from over 300 gifts. It just works :)
---
If you are on Xbox and you are launching your first nuke don't be afraid to use the LFG system to get some help. Thee are plenty of chill players on this game that love helping new players. I ,myself don't mind helping either of you want to hmu.
---
I'm not sure about the item limit for the Santa stash, but I clocked one item every 7 minutes.
---
It fixed itself after not playing for about 3-4 hours.
---
Bethesda, in the ocean
---
I had no idea there were FO Funko Pops
---
You can do them solo.
---
Many players prefer to launch nukes solo because it‚Äôs faster and easier
---
To find players to do missions with Discord is a great place
---
It‚Äôs not a physical form o don‚Äôt believe? The robot gave it to me
---
Good call. I hopped worlds, and even though it took forever for the door to even be selectable, it eventually loaded and let me in. Weird.
---
I have a mutant melee build so i cant tank mobs.  I do bring a heavy gun but i still somehow just get killed. Maybe its the shitty level scaling and im just unlucky?
---
Most likely band-aided like everything else.
---
Thanks, the first form (DMV-AT-21C) was provided by the terminal, then acquired the postmarked letter and now tasked with acquiring this new form.
---
I also got it cheap (5 caps) from someone dumping all their plans at that price.  I don't know if they missed it or just didn't care.
---
So you google the form name and followed the instructions and what happened?
---
I just sneak in and one shot every ghoul where they stand.  Walk right through the whole golf club.
---
IGN is WhiteRabbitTales. I'm down in Watoga
---
The restrictions are in place, and won't be lifted, because we will be getting sandboxing NPCs in our camps. It is all to prevent Generic Settler from rotating in place while saying "Need something?"
---
one word: modders
---
"We would like to apologize" dude, this folks spent hundreds of hours grinding for that gear and now it's gone. That's how you're going to react? Just apologizing for not giving a client a decent product? This is crazy. Your lack of respect for this old community it's an example about how you do things.  You couldn't even accept refunding when your game started sinking. Never going to buy anything from Bethesda again.
---
Another good way to avoid the golf club ghouls is to get them to follow you into the tennis court. Then you can jump over the net in the middle to avoid them, while still shooting or meleeing them. I've cleared it solo during a nuke zone, on a low level character (25-35) that way (It took a long time though)
---
You insert the sample then go back to the terminal and hit enter the password ( I think - been a little while ) and I find it completes. Something like that.
---
There is a printer next to each of the robots. I think that's what you're looking for.
---
You know what would be nice? A decent building system....

10 items max, I believe. So, you gotta check like once every hourish. Remember to lock it too, porch pirates exist in Appalachia.
---
Mmm. Yes. This pleases me. I share in agreement to this post.

---
What platform are you on?  Love a chance to buy a winter coat and not grind out that 14k xp.
---
And using it all the time takes away from the effectiveness of your character in a fight.
---
It‚Äôs a trade off.
---
Personally I don‚Äôt use it at all as my armour pretty much never degrades because I‚Äôm a stealth commando.
---
You can play FO76 solo in a private world.
---
My character is still level 15 how do I make it so i have all the perks before level 50 it a stealth bloddy comando build
---
I'm broke bro, and I wouldn't get enough from the $100 price tag to justify trying to work it in somehow.
---
No thanks.
---
I love FO76 but if they want more online fallout games it should be done by a studio separate to the team that works on single player fallout.
---
Also...they really need better writers because their plot lines in recent games have sucked balls and lacked any depth.
---
It‚Äôs rare but I just sold mine for 5k so it‚Äôs pretty valuable
---
To be fair, most of the anger is rightly justified from people who *have* played it, and blaming complaints on external agitators is pretty biased.
---
You can't. You have to level up.
---
Agree
---
Price wise- you can get more value by buying other titles
---
I have been server hopping too to see if that would change it, but still no Holiday Scorched.
---
I was on an hour ago and was still getting them, they do seem a bit less common than at the start, but I think it's just random.
---
Ok found it! So the DMV bot says the form can be collected from the courthouse, however I found it in the DMV building, first door on the left when looking down the hallway with the horseman statue behind you. 
---
Mystery solved!
---
I also saw a decline, but now I‚Äôm not seeing them at all, is there a sort of counter or limit to how many can spawn?
---
What're you talking about?
---
The main complaints rn are issues that would only be seen by people actively playing.
---
You must not have had any items stolen yet if you feel that way
---
When I was a low level I would do as you said, look around and see if there are enough players above lv 150. I would look for 5-7 just in case. I would then message the highest lv person directly just to give them a heads up that I was trying to drop. If they didn‚Äôt respond I would find a server with a better population of high levels.
---
It's a shame, because the general plot of 76 is fairly interesting (or at least the way it starts, anyway, it looked promising). It could have made a really good single player game with online support.
---
This is exactly why I love and encourage everyone no matter their level to show up. Every time she lands a wave will spawn. The more players present the more time I have to hit her until the wave inevitably makes its way to me, hitting me and showing the SBQ my presence.
---
Just post on here that your LFG. You‚Äôll definitely find some people!
---
As has been said go back to flatwoods.
---
There are: 
---
- crops for vegetables
---
- Brahmin for Brahmin milk (the poor mans radaway), meat, and hide (for leather).
---
- a river to spam the hell out the store water key and boil it so you have plenty to drink.
---
- Workbenches all around to use.
---
- medical supplies in a few boxes you can loot for stimpaks.  (Though the airport is better for that BUT the airport has low level scorched to deal with).
---
Only had this happen to me once with a molerat. I hate how they spawn so far away and it takes forever to finally show the markers. The airport is the worse
---
I need a guide so I can get all the perks I have a learning disability and I don't want to.mess up like my other level 50 because i could not get all of the perks
---
the event ends on the 31st i believe
---
Main points for me:
---
Bandolier is pretty useless with a commando in my experience.
---
Take that second point of strength and put it in charisma, then get 1 rank of strong back.
---
Change your endurance to fireproof 1
---
Get rid of tenderiser and get lone wanderer rank 4
---
Drop critical savvy and grim reapers sprint.
---
Add in starched genes and 1 rank of class freak.Ôøº
---
Get four leaf clover.
---
For me, my current build he SPECIAL of 1, 14, 1, 4, 6, 15, 15.
---
I may take a point out of luck or agility and move it to perception when I get the third rank of master commando (I was a stealth sniper).
---
That‚Äôs what I thought too
---
Get an explosive shotgun and put 2 points in enforcer. You can cripple everything before you even hit 50.
---
That tower will ruin any and all SBQ fights, as she won't be able to land. Besides, the ground mobs provide bonus Adrenaline damage... you WANT them to spawn.
---
**Please don't EVER build that tower again**, as it has caused us to fail the first SBQ fight in a very, very long time (500+ kills).
---
Would be cool if each new mode had a vault/origin backstory as well. Like how vault 51 was for a BR experiment, I‚Äôm sure they can make a similar area with a backstory for horde mode for instance.
---
I‚Äôm BunniFruFru on Xbox. Mostly play after work, a few evenings a week.
---
How many turrets do you have? Turrets are the largest consumer of budget and are for the most part more then a couple or 3 are over kill as frankly you just don‚Äôt need that many to kill the stuff that come into your camp. Granted not everyone kills the stuff when they come to visit your vendor but if everyone did that there‚Äôs no need for more then a spotlight and a missile turret.
---
I‚Äôve already encountered couple of assholes, I‚Äôm building my camps and they show up and just start shooting me
---
And it's STILL happening today...
---
Never implied you were working for bethesda just used your own experience to shift the conversation back to them.
---
By hacking the system with cheat engine they found out that password were saved in simple text format.
---
Also the whole time they were speaking with bethesda reps so it's not like they were lonewolfing it. They were banned by another division of beth because apparently they don't talk. It's like your roommate calling the cops while you agreed to let them test your house security.
---
Yeah they're everywhere, bored high level guys mostly.....
---
if really low level stuff(1-5) try putting in that corpse next(slightly to the left, near the steps) to vault 76.
---
Can also just drop it as a paper bag in perfect view of the vault upon exiting, but it will evaporate after a few minutes.
---
I've locked the terminal and the hopper, yet sometimes when I've logged on it's reset to just collecting junk, so it's always a good thing to check...
---
the numbers i have are from a perfect world IF there was no push towards crap roles but i do not have those types of numbers, these states i came up with were just so people can have small idea how hard it can be to get items they want, i have couple thousand hours in game and i have never had a piece of armor i needed for my build drop, all my good items i had drop were weapons which i was forced to trade for armor pieces.
---
This was to show not everyone is capable of such luck though, why duping is such a problem in this game, and why people buy in game items off ebay as there is no actual grind to it, and that this game is nothing but pure luck
---
I saw several tonight, so it's still going on. It seems like they lowered the holiday scorched spawn rate when they increased the santatron gift rate. I haven't seen nearly as many since then, far too long to just be poor RNG luck.
---
&gt;grimskillator
---
Whereabouts are you located? Maybe a 76er who lives nearby could recommend a place that would be affordable &amp; allow dogs.   
---
I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm not the best with words in situations like these, but it's overwhelming when life dumps a bunch of things that would be really difficult to handle individually all at the same time :(
---
How does somebody "member" something? You seem to do it a lot and are crying about us not doing it.
---
Hmm. Complete opposite interaction for me. I keep running into high level players who kill me for my workshop just to farm the santatron gift machine.
---
Someone went around and stole from over 500 players items. By this point im sure many more have been affected.
---
Fake news about what I'm fucking pissed
---
Because that would require shutting down all the servers, and tbh I don't know what Bethesda's doing at this point.
---
They were nearly unobtainable before the event as the drop chance is so tiny from forest events or maps(?). Once you hit a certain level forest events are just mundane and dull so the grind to get the plan isn't even that engaging. That being said, I never obtained it in 2k hours until yesterday when I purchased it from a vending machine for 50 caps. Merry Christmas to me.
---
It used to be extremely rare because it only dropped from certain events and then with a very low percentage. Thus it was very valuable to players who wanted to learn all the plans and I suppose to the occasional oddball who wanted to be able to craft tomahawks. 
---
Now its value has plummeted because of the presents. I see them in PVMs for 2-3k occasionally.
---
Thanks heaps, if it says iron does it extract as steel scrap?
---
What do you want us to do??
---
Invest in Bobby pins, it will be the next secondary currency one day.
---
help me grind some armor
---
Howd you get scammed?
---
we did a trade and they said to drop first and i was foolish enough to do it because i had known the person for a while and trusted them
---
Try getting some decent armor from vendors for cheap. Then try launching a queen. Good way to get started again. Also the santas drop legendaries so go to GC and game them. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get some decent pieces
---
It's beautiful
---
That sucks man...if you were on PC id help you out.  You sure they fucked you over or were they just disconnected on accident?
---
I was just going to say this exactly.
---
Yes pls, this is needed @bethesda
---
again there is that luck on getting item roles, it shouldnt be that way, in my opinion items should be grindable, but what makes it even worse is the fact that there are roles out there that completely breaky weapons like 250 damage resist which seems to spawn a good bit, which bethesda cannot fix, and just refuse to remove broken perks in which you have much better odds at getting 1 out of 6,776 to get just the 250 damage resist that breaks half the perks on a weapon, the odds of rolling a broken item a year after it comes out should never be that high of a chance
---
The armour sure,  but combined with the Western duster? Cops countrywide weren't going round dressed as cowboy stormtroopers....
---
Go to the official Bethesda forums where there have always been people acting like this game is the best thing they've ever player. The make excuses like it's their job. They're either a little messed up in the head, are financially invested in the company, know someone who works for the company or play one game every few years and don't know any better. Either way, they're clueless.
---
It must be item types and not stacks. I just took 13 fertilizer, along with 6 small gifts, 2 large, and 1 medium (as well as a lot of other random crap out).
---
Maybe there were 10 different types, though.
---
Indeed, nephew Hirschi!
---
Awesome! Well, since my post, I got a new one from Santatron, so I guess I'll try to sell it.
---
The 250 DR while reloading was, allegedly, fixed two patches ago. I'm using it on a handmade and so far no issues.
---
This is cool af
---
If you go look at the update they actually rolled back the fix on that as there fix ended up breaking armor pieces and people were losing damage resistance of there armor pieces after the reload

---
The holiday scorched event ended
---
If you are however crouching with a weapon it for some reason doesnt break the first perks so if you do a sneak/stealth build with the 250 damage resist you wouldnt necessarily notice it but standing up it breaks handful the first perks including vampire and bloodied
---
Oooh. Ok, that's good to know. Mines instigating explosive, that's probably why it's not giving me any trouble.
---
Just a heads up, 2x Lvl 3 Hvy Gun perks = 40% yes? You could get the same with 5 pts spent(2x Lvl 1 + 1x Lvl 3) and still have 1 pt left to increase damage further or spend elsewhere. First lvl of each Hvy Gun perk is 10% so you want 1 of each before buying a Lvl2 for only 5% more.
---
Was a low level who had accidentally fast travelled to the mire,was walking in the dark jungle, while it was already night and there was sounds, scary ones. I was already frightened to the hell and back, there i suddenlly saw an alien, standing on top of a hill, looking into my eyes. All of a sudden he pointed his hands at me, I paniced, running away while crying " aaaaaaah why did I come here". My unplanned running, took me to a high way in the mire. The alien had finally lost my track, relaxing me a bit, though i was still jogging, struggling to get out of the mire, to get rid of all the high ranked enemies. There I saw a movement, " did everyone see that " me said to me. I went closer, " holy freaking bottle of nuka cola " said I when I saw the gigantic animal coming out of the van...... what happened next? I was running away, screaming " please! I need help " there comes two heroes in power armors. " don't worry brother we got you " said the stranger with a free states logo on his chest. They got that creature. They gave me a few stimpaks and a handmade so I can protect myself. That day I joined the free states, and I made a C.A.M.P. in the mire, watching everything and keeping everyone safe.
---
The event has ended
---
Taming albinos isn't possible unfortunately.
---
put in a bug report, and maybe you'll get something for it. I had it happen to me, hackers are actively trying to destroy the game because...I don't know, their mommies didn't love them enough, I guess?
---
Yeah will do
---
It shouldn‚Äôt end until the 31st?
---
I wonder when they changed that.
---
Agree... except when one happens to be a 3\* legendary, that one somehow dies fast and the missle turrets just flip and flop his body somewhere so u can't find him :D
---
Aww, chucks!
---
Get all the ultracite (or just a few),  then fast travel out and go back in. Find a vein that you had already looted but is graphically there but you can't collect it. Spam the pick up button until mobs spawn. Doesn't work well with 1 person, works really well the more people you have in team. If you come back and none of the ultracite you collected has falsely respawned, leave and come back until it does. Dying also helps. Your goal is to get those falsely respawned ultracite to appear then you are golden.
---
Goddammit
---
It happened late on Sunday, and Bethesda took the PC servers down on Monday and fixed the exploit.
---
The robbery was fault of Bethesda, their lack of security and bad code writing. So it's their responsibility to restore all missing items to players. Your idea is nice but may be abused by players who haven't been robbed.
---
Legendary spawns are non-existent at my camp, to the best of my knowledge.  I live not far from Hemlock holes.  Grafton Monster is a frequent spawn and he's pretty low level but the turrets don't do shit to him. Or super mutants. Or rad rats. Or rad toads.
---
I'm hoarding all the "usually rare" plans until well after the event...because they'll go back up in value when the glut's past.
---
i found out that heavy laser turrets are capable of killing something (as long as you have 10 of those and they decide to take a break from shooting santatron and actually defend) üòÖ
---
I know so the prove will be necessary.  
---
Just consider this possibilty before U trow it into trash.
---
Feel that pain lmao
---
No, it's til the 31st.
---
maybe someone with reputation on this forum can also help. I can onrganize a list of itmes.
---
Edit: Nukacrypt codes are valid it just says the wrong week on the site.
---
They are not able to "punish" us, so please don't give Bethesda, your mother, any more money. Please don't enable them any more.
---
there is no lvl scaling in v94 amount and lvl of enemies is the same for solo player lvl 10 entering v94 and full team of lvl 300+
---
GT?
---
I am a solo player, no audio input device is installed.
---
Yeah.... Good luck with that.
---
Holy crap you are a Bethesda shill. What's new.
---
that's correct and limit is weight based after reaching 10 lbs he will stop, quantity can vary as gifts are super light but junk can be quite heavy. From my experience santatron can keep going for about 2 hours on average
---
I love this game, I haven't touched fallout since fallout 4 which was unplayable for me due to controls on PC being really shitty. But the entertainment value is high with the monthly "mishaps" by Bethesda and their inability to handle what seems to be the same issue over and over (hacks). One would think they would learn to manage these issues after a few times? Fallout 76 is probably the best game I didn't buy!
---
Sometimes if feels like camp defenses exist just to break so we will have to keep grinding for materials to repair them.
---
Extremely satisfying taking down  the SBQ? Maybe read up some more.
---
Downvoted.
---
Being able to use wallpaper without every darn thing on the wall being stored (including power conduits on the outside!) would be helpful.  I couldn't figure out why everything was dark when my windmill was not destroyed, then figured out the conduits on the outside went poof!
---
I'm parked near the station with the legendary vender girl/moleminer (forgot name) and I often get ghouls, super mutants, toads, etc attacking, and maybe 25-30% of the time have a legendary in the pack. Weirdly enough it always seems that one legendary becomes squishy as all fuq the second you notice him(the turrets could be pelting him for 5 minutes straight, and you realize that something isn't dying fast, so u go look)
---
the second u notice its a leg, u start toward it and poof it dies and its corpse is flung away(and in the mire there are enough trees and other junk to 'hide' corpses well, assuming they don't just drop though the ground and vanish, which ALSO happens often enough to be a 'thing')
---
On the topic of the turrets, I try to keep a mix (IE: 1 missile, 1 hvy laser, 1 MKII machine gun @ 4 separate corners with good lines of fire and no blind spots, with one more shotgun turret inside next to the gen powering it all) so that you cover most possible resistance types.
---
unfortunately it's working as intended üòî, you suppose to meet in main menu form team and then join private server if you want your session to be private. alternatively when joining your private server you can switch to all friends and then everyone from your friend list can join you freely
---
YEET
---
No, no, just no. Running around with other peeps might be fun and all, but it's often immersion breaking (dudes with skirts fighting deathclaws, everyone jumping 20ft in the air because of some invisible mutation, etc etc). And the world is just too empty without proper npcs. They made such a big gorgeous WV that feels like missed potential most of the time. If only this was a singleplayer game set just before the scorched plague wiped everyone out...
---
This pretty swell of you (And anyone who joins)
---
I got robbed, but after a day (and one super kind person) I have been able to recover most of what I lost(I'm still on the loss end of the scale, but I'm able to 'play' again, so I am fine)
---
Wish I could help out some, but other than a couple 'meh' tier 3\* legendaries (IE: too good to script, but not fitting for my build or good enough to be considered by anyone using tip top gear), there isn't alot I could offer.
---
First of all, I never bought it, it was a gift from a friend because I wanted the cosmetics and a private world. I never asked to be griefed just for have a month sub. I'm not pay 100$ for that yearly shit.
---
You should not have sold me fo76 under false premises. Now I hate you with a passion. The Liars. You fucked me good without my say. Imagine what I think of you, now. Now I hate you - and I will have my revenge. Regards++
---
No it hasn‚Äôt ended. I just ran into several holiday Scorched.
---
You dont need any materials to fix items in your camp. Just pick up your camp and put it back down, all it costs is the caps.
---
Oh boy.
---
You can't see the irony in fo76 trying to legally go after someone?
---
If you paid attention there are some raiders who did not murder randoms
---
I assume you work with fo76 with your statements. Can I have my money back, before I sue you?
---
That‚Äôs not true. When they applied the fix they shut down pc servers only.
---
Wait a minute!!! Positivity?!! That is not permitted on this subreddit!!! 
---
Please delete this post and start whinging about something immediately!!! 
---
Jks - as many issues as this game has, I love it. Have been playing since January and still enjoying it and look forward to logging on most days.
---
For whatever reason, its not currently possible to transfer items onto the responder corpse near vault 76
---
Pc users should get an xb1. No worries about hardware drivers or bluescreens.
---
Anybody want a free mounted mothman/SBQ plan, now that we're done with the hacking? PC
---
Fox is the only one now legally allowed in cananda for being so untruthful. So I'd say they are by far the worst.
---
nice try bethesda
---
using weapons to cripple wings or slowing down with cryolator sometimes works sometimes wont. any more specific info on how to do it right? ps4
---
I usually build free CAMPs from the ground up for any player who accepts my help.
---
I got 5 tonight so far without even really hunting them
---
Or he just likes the game? You do realise people have different tastes? No reason to be a rude cunt because someone is having fun
---
Why would I want that? Dupes are just more rampant on Xbox than on pc. The hacks have been patched. So why jump to a console with more issues than current pc?
---
Like how do they do this? I'm not trying to hack or anything but I'm genuinely wondering how they manage that
---
There are some who are fascinated but gold painted shit and others who see beyond the paint.

Santa is a babe! Is Santa going to release a pin-up calendar for 2020?

Im gonna leave this here: [https://ibb.co/L9bHwSP](https://ibb.co/L9bHwSP)

That's when you only add in the lowest possible rank of turret for players (Mk1)
---
One of those balance ideas that seemed good on paper
---
The spot I placed my camp, The only enemies are low level ghouls which die in one hit. Have you tried other areas?
---
Right?!! I've had no plans in above 500 caps! May need to fix that!!! ü§≠
---
I get this. One char, my sneaky rifleman can go a week without repairs. So I thought, meh, must be overexagerated a bit and made a melee build. My. God. I went through more ballistic fiber in one day than I did in the previous month. I was having to repair gear every hour. I wasn't used to *actually* being hit.
---
Eventually, just gave up repairing it and am running around in busted, trashy armor.
---
Some level 434 yesterday on ps4 was dropping the beanie a s fur lined jacket to everyone he came across! Made for a fun day!
---
Its already fixed since 23 December
---
The range on them is awful, yet somehow my shotgun turrets aggro a flying scorchbeast.
---
The only mildly satisfying thing is littering my crop fields with punji boards, thats my corn newbs so stay away
---
Cannot equip other headwear with it
---
.... no, no they arent. I have 2 turrets pointing at my local spawn point, a heavy laser and a missle, and nothing gets near my base except for the occasional molerat that sneaks by. You are not doing it right and should consider using common sense instead of trying to evenly disperse your turrets and making them look pretty.
---
Old news now. It's been patched for a few days
---
Dont u need spotlights for better turret accuracy real question.
---
Lol got pipi in your eyes bitch?
---
I wouldn't follow anyone. I have played as a solo and an escorted character. Finding the wasteland alone is a much more enjoyable experience or with another low level player rather than being led by a higher level and leveling up fast. Over the next few days find an area with scorch and farm for early legendary items. Decide on your Character build early if you can and research your end game build. Have fun out there. Bugs can be frustrating and fun. Just enjoy the environment. PS put your character in passive mode...
---
I was getting annoyed so put down about 10 turrets. My camp is in an area where level 5 scorched appear. Every time I come back all 10 turrets are broken. Level 255. Pretty ridiculous.
---
go ....
---
shut your bitch ass up and go to sleep, it's past your bedtime
---
Go to places that arent hit often.
---
I just woke up it's 11am here dumb troll
---
Yes. There was a guy before insulting me that they don't exist at that time. I love it when people aren't able to understand a thing a straight up down vote.
---
then take your bitch ass in the kitchen and eat breakfast mommy made you and get off reddit LMAO
---
imagine actually trying to play a game inside of a VM. being that its virtualized, all of your interrupts would be fucked because they have to pass through the hypervisor layer before making it to bare metal. You need specific hardware designed for virtualization and im not just talking about "lol i7 with VT-d". timers would be shit unless your hypervisor is able to pass signals fast enough from hardware instead of virtualizing the timer as well. you'd be interfacing through some kind of spice/vnc server so all 3d optimizations wont work. the only way to get a modern, highly resource intensive game like fo76 to run in a vm is with specially picked hardware with good IOMMU support intended to run VMs so that you can manage GPU passthrough, and because the game is running off of physical hardware, you can still ban based on the GPU's HWID. 
---
tldr: HWID banning is effective and no one is going to go though the effort of understanding the internals of windows hyperv or linux kvm kernel modules just so that they can cheat at a videogame
---
[proof that i know what im talking about.](https://highguard.net/setting-up-a-windows-gaming-vm-using-gpu-pass-through-on-linux/) im not even done with this yet and im like 40 hours in.
---
Should see the Lever Action then, that thing breaks like after what? 70-100 bullets?
---
Hey Todd
---
when your only insult is "dumb" and "bitch" on the internet you really don't sound like you're 33, if the first thing you do when you wake up is look at a subreddit for a dead game you need to reevaluate your life, it sounds sad af LMAO go do something productive with your morning you waste of oxygen ü§¶
---
I too got the Mothman and also an Assaultron Funko from the bearded fella.. (Who didn't half clatter about and his voice sounded a tad metallic..)

Micrrostransactions started happening as soon as they made a mobile game. This was inevitable.

I got a notification that you replied to my comment dumb troll bitch. Your just here to molest people. Please die
---
Level 2 turrets are easier on the budget and seem to do a better job in my opinion. my current base set up is ten level 2s on a 4 foundation wide movable base. they are all closely grouped and seemed to do the same damage output as a player. I even put it down at the queen fight sometimes to help with the adds and conserve ammo.
---
Lol, I had both in my camp for 10 caps a pop. I literally had one person clear a vending machine. I imagine he is marking them up to absorbent prices. If somebody asks me to make them I'll do it for free.
---
I remember when I felt like that a year ago. It quickly gets worse after that first launch.
---
You took mentats or something it will wear off
---
I think you took some berry mentats?
---
Very useless. 1 Super Mutant took out all my turrets by being far away enough were my turrets could reach him. I just watched with disappointment and then said F these useless turrets. I rather repair a wall than repair a turret anyway
---
I didnt pay for it myself, a friend got it for me as a gift. I enjoy it and wanted it for the private world , the cosmetics, and the loot box. I happen to have loaded up inventory and desperately wanted to make space. So yeah.
---
Yeh, it's the community that makes that game I think.
---
The writer is writing late news and publishing it after it was patched. Lolz...
---
Haven't played FO76 Yet, hopefully I get lucky!
---
Nice, I got one just like that in Point Pleasant a few months back.
---
The spawn rate reduced drastically. Now its very rare and when u hear the bells. U will see everyone rushing and killing the legendary quickly
---
The mirelurk kings in there are brutal if you're unprepared.
---
&gt;"What are you pulling from my post that I enjoy seeing people get hacked? If you look at my comments I call out that hackers are shitty as well. The point of this shows that Bethesda should t have let this happen in the first place. Your beginning arguments aren‚Äôt even valid, they are straw man. Not dissing the game itself as I enjoyed it for a while, I just can‚Äôt enjoy a game when the company itself starts to neglect its player base and then it gets to a point like we are at. You can‚Äôt praise Bethesda for fixing a problem that shouldn‚Äôt have happened in the first place. Look at my previous comments, I don‚Äôt hate the game I hate the way Bethesda has treated it and it‚Äôs players"  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I think I replied to the wrong person in this case. looking at our entire conversation it seems misplaced. no idea who I was supposed to be responding too lol.
---
Awesome:) yeah, by Solomon's I meant that behemoth near Solomon's pond and twin lakes. It's quite fun to one shot the Swan copy-paste
---
ah I see you figured out the issue already. to save someone a jump screen they are

launched 6 times today on these codes they are valid.
---
have a very bad bug, crashing on ALL crafting or detail view by now, lags and delay when crafting was there from beginning. 
---
started a 2nd char and noticed significant increase in speed, loading and no more second long delays when crafting.
---
food for thought.
---
Me too. Totally in-love with it. Looting and scrapping. Changing camp. Go on a rampage and take out different kind of enemies with different kind of weapons. I‚Äôm trying with a shotgun and perfect storm right now. But when 15 legendary gouls come my way I just have to do a real heavy weapon combined with alot of explosives.
---
For me, i just drop it in front of them. Some will just walk away... if so, then means they does not want help. Let them be.
---
I wish melee weapons could do that instead of hitting one enemy at a time.
---
You have something that highlights living targets.  Like mentats or the power armour helmet mod.
---
I LOVE how it seems everyone who has ever been fired for incompetence somehow got a job at Bethesda lol. I have never seen a company where every single employee is a complete failure LOL
---
Bethesda don‚Äôt care about you or your opinions on this game. They just want your money.
---
Are you fucking kidding me?
---
Since when should checking social media be a requirement to play safely? Would it be that hard to give an in game warning? They do it easily enough every fucking time I log in, when the objective is selling me shit.
---
And how is it not their fault when they released an unfinished product with a B grade engine for online? They also charge you for the option of playing alone when it should be a feature from the start. They never warned the players about any subscription system to unlock features. That's kind of important when you sell s game to people who could very well not be able to afford it.
---
Their response is also disgusting. It has been shown that they knew about this before it went public. The reasonable thing to do would be to close servers down and fix it. Now a poor joe who gets home from work to play some fallout 76 lost a big part of his accomplishments from a year of his free time. All because some idiots decided to fuck around with people. And all because bethesda could not be fucking bothered to warn players. Or close servers. Fuck it, right? People should go to social media before playing because it is so hard to issue in game warnings that are not about the latest color of socks you can buy or the damn subscription to play the game without being robbed.
---
What in the god damn are you talking about?
---
Sorry I'm on ps4!!!
---
I think it works as protection from air born diseases already. You can wear urban scout masks with it though. Has a really sweet look.
---
Dont ask dont get, no harm in asking for a rework on something thats desperately in need of one, if they say they want to support this game indefinitely then its going to need a rework at some point.  
---
They reworked a lot of the event system and more changes are coming with that
---
I mean i said it in both the title and in the post itself "after wastelanders" which very heavily implies that they do what need to be done eith wastelanders first
---
&gt; Juicehead has a video of a Atom shop skinned dagger being stolen and equipped by the hacker with his atom shop skin still on the dagger.
---
Exactly.  They stole a dagger with a skin on.  They didn't steal the plan for the skin, which is what you bought from the atom shop.
---
&gt; What exactly are they wrong about when they say "they can steal your atomic shop items as well"? Seeing as they literally can steal the item with the skin and equip it without ever buying the skin themselves.
---
Since they don't know the plan they can't craft new daggers with the skin, but you can.  It's clear that they haven't stolen what you bought from the shop, they've stolen something made using the plan you bought.
---
&gt; That sure seems like "stealing atomic shop items" to me.
---
Because you're using a (deliberately?) confusing phrase "atomic shop items" to muddy the waters and bump up the outrage.
---
There is no need to exaggerate the bad effects of this hack, if someone stole my  Junkies FFR +1PER .50cal that would be 1000 times worse than someone stealing my camo T51b PA.  I could get the PA back in a day but it took me over 1000 hours of play to get the .50cal.
---
A revent could incude an "undo last" function if you mibe something and cant get it back or place something that goes somewhere you can no longer get it
---
Strange how there was an mg42 mod for fallout 4 that was miles better. It did decent damage, had a full set of customisation and had a nice reload that was realistic. As for scopes yes it should be possible but Bethesda are lazy (again the mod let you do that), honestly don't feel the mg42 is worth using in 76
---
All wrong answers. Berry mentats doesn't affect you. You are glowing pink because someone shot you with a vox syringer. It wil last untill you log out.
---
No they didnt, the buttons to activate the elevators would soawn about 30 metres above them meaning there was no way to use it, it was a bug that was the bane of my existance in fo4 and all but stopped me using them, i will find youtube videos on this since you seem to think im lying
---
Look at my posts you absolute gargoyle, im not a "bethesda bad" person i simply stated a fact, if you cant understand that thats on you
---
I've had this issue ongoing for months. Submitted a bug report as well.
---
As far as i know this happens when someone else killed the cryptid you were hunting but you took the tissue sample anyway. The final stage of the quest cannot complete and ends up being blank.
---
Hopefully this will get patched sometime...
---
u/gnarlygaster response is so good I couldn't add to it to make it better.
---
Honestly just build a floating house if you can, traps can work on dogs or ghouls in a pinch but anything with range is likely to kill off expensive turrets quite easily. It's a shame really
---
I know how rare they were but the market was completely destroyed buy this event. I sell a metal dense for 250 in my shop and it's there for over a week.
---
I'll be honest I like the game for the crazy stuff that I've seen because of it, technically a bad game but the number of insane encounters I've had could make a small book or something.
---
Still prefer New Vegas
---
Due to the fact that the majority of visitors to my CAMP, before they go to my vending machine, will try to get to the collection box of the Santatron. (Sneaky little thieves! We hates em all!) I have now redesigned my CAMP and have fully enclosed the Santatron, I do have a door on the inside that gives me access to the collection box.  
---
Enclosing the Santatron does not seem to affect it's gathering, well the RNG based item generation in the collection box, and no sneaky thieveses stealing my holiday gifts.
---
&gt;pounding him
---
heh
---
its the pram one i cant get it removed
---
Level 1 turrets do fine west of Charleston station. Granted everything is always low level.
---
Put them on a foundation facing your base.
---
Pram? If you mean the hacked aid item theni'm not sorry ,you'll glow forever.
---
Submit a support ticket Bethesda is working on restoring items.
---
Got some level 1 turrets on and next to wrecked cars so when a creature appears they shoot the cars - big explosion and everything is dead üòÑ
---
Does it come with a scum bar an a three headed monkey?
---
Hell of s questline but a funny one - got me struggling as well. After all it wasn‚Äôt bugged but the online resources including the Bethesda website makes you think you ran into a bug.
---
You can wear it with Glasses or face masks, but not other helmets.
---
I feel like he made a subjective comment about his experience. He doesn‚Äôt have to read up on shit lol
---
i did it with 2chars. just wont work. Also Beckley. I got abandoned Bog Town as well that will not work.
---
More power to ya ma dude ya should hit peps up about doing some co op plenty of chill fellas to help ya.
---
It‚Äôs so frustrating!
---
I don't know if it still works, but a way to get around the bug a while ago was to make a new character and go there. Some locations not checking off on one character might on another. But the challenge is account wide so it would count towards the goal.
---
Honestly I don't see power armour as being worth it in this game, with the right perks and some decent Marine gear you can push the DR system as far as it can go while avoiding the downsides if PA
---
Farming the whitespring can be safely done at around level 30 even, at least that is when I started to do it
---
When push comes to shove you can just sit safely and bait the ghouls to the open, even better with marsupial and movement perks
---
incoming class action lawsuit
---
PM sent
---
invest 2points in exterminator perk and they wont bother you again. they were my nemesis, now its those damn chinese robots that hide in the grass from vats
---
I tried spotlights, for some reason they seem to loose power whenever you fast travel away and go dark. Not broken, they just stop working. I gave up using them, imho they are bugged/broken.
---
I had a camp around there. Do you appear is the middle of the water when you fast travel back? Back when the loading times were significantly worse I would phase with a couple hundred rads every time.
---
[https://youtu.be/FpXVAMmo2WM?t=62](https://youtu.be/FpXVAMmo2WM?t=62)  
---
Here you go trog
---
Same here. Today I created a character especially to get this challange done, but this new character also couldn't discover Beckeley :( I also have missing abandoned  Bog Town, so RIP my 80 atoms. 
---
I was looking in the internet for some way to complete it, and first reddit posts mentioning this bug were from a YEAR ago.
---
Cmon Bethesda, I can't believe you can't fix such a small bug for over a year...
---
IDK, man, who has recently stripped thousands of people off their inventories using hacks then?
---
GT: captive scholar
---
I‚Äôm new to the game, lvl 21 atm and looking for anyone to play with and help me learn.
---
I got Fallout 1st because I just was diggin‚Äô the game so hard so I have Private Worlds.
---
Stay strong brothers and sisters. I know that having deppresion is very hard. Have Happy Holidays!  Keep positive stay close to the ones who really love you and care about you. It has helped me alot in hard times. Take care. Peace
---
I mean I'll list some problems I guess
---
Weapon balancing is pretty bad
---
The repair system sucks 
---
Teleporting enemies (lag mostly)
---
Random hostilities with whitespring bots
---
The large number of glitch abusers on launch hasn't helped 
---
Pay to win aspects, the fact that fallout first exists especially
---
Initial launch was awful, many would argue it still is
---
Some features (camps) not working
---
Performance issues 
---
Graphical issues 
---
Connection issues 
---
Lack of story and... the fallout feel I suppose
---
Disliking this game isn't illogical, it feels rushed and poorly made although I'll admit talk of certain updates is tempting me back, if only for a little bit.
---
Not everyone is on reddit 24/7; casual players might not have even known what happened...
---
If that's the case then where are all these duped items because I'm not seeing them. Also, no duped dev room items available on the Xbox or the prydwen flying around or Preston Garvey.
---
Out of curiosity, what platform did you play it on? I never had an issue
---
at least we are not alone :) good luck
---
When is the last time you played? The game crashes on ps4 for me sometimes but otherwise they have really improved it
---
See I agree with you 100% but I'm stuck between lonewander/bodyguard vs. tenderizer. I'm only planning to have 3 points in Charisma.
---
Call me crazy, but I've had my camp in 4 separate places now without defense and nothing attacks them. I swear turrets attract mobs. Have you tried just having no defense?
---
All for this budüëç camp building is the true endgame
---
PC
---
Shortly after they added the sheepsquatch I think, it crashed a couple of times but I still felt that a lot of the issues were in the game so I lost interest again
---
I would like items in displays to NOT count towards CAMP budgets OR inventory weight.
---
Not only do turrets NOT do anything, enemies will spawn in the center of your base. I've had mine locked up while I was maintaining my weapons and armor and a ghoul just decided it would spawn on top of my generator.
---
I feel like if they do decide to make another online fallout game (which I also think they should, I find the game a lot more fun with friends and doesn‚Äôt make the world feel as desolate), they should make it so that there is an online story and a solo story, a bit like RDR2. There are some people that prefer fallout as a solo game, so there can be a solo mode with maybe a different story that links to the online story in some way. Probably wouldn‚Äôt happen though with Bethesda‚Äôs current engine, but I think that it would be fun and adds more play time
---
I dont know, im not interested in hacking Fallout76 or rob other players items.
---
I don't know if that is possible either but that would be awesome. I would have to go junkies...but it would make my toon jittery...lol
---
My turrets shoot my stuff and eachother........Anyone got that problem too. I started Fallout 76 I'm low lvl lol.
---
Heh heh
---
One of the first few events I was apart of resulted in me getting in the mothman mask which I wear quite often, ironically the first time I ever saw the mothman was at my camp a few days ago and I killed him. I probably should have pacified him huh
---
Haven't had the issue, have you tried jumping servers?
---
Anymore when I log in most if not ALL of my missile shooters do NOTHING. A handful of my machine guns wanna target the Santatron robot. I have had mobs come to my camp and only a small fraction of my defenses fight it... the rest do nothing or are more interested in fighting my own camp.
---
Yes! This.
---
Hope you're planning to launch another one soon, I need flux like it's nobody's business .lol
---
That's the only time I ever used a stealth boy. That cave was insane at a lower level. I think I might go try it now, I haven't been back
---
Can some one confirm this? If something is broken in my camp all I have to do it move my camp like 1 inch and then it's all repaired? This would've save a ton of resources for me
---
No
---
It's very fun game. I'm excited for wastelander update.
---
Silver extracts as scrap as well, not ore.
---
Another thing to be added for 2500 atoms in its own bundle I guess. Good idea tho
---
Sure as hell hope not... I'm not paying for that shit.
---
This is even worse. I built in some wrecked houses, and monsters just spawned inside my base. Every. Time. I. Fast. Travelled.
---
The Scrapbox should've been free for everyone, I wouldn't care if they made it free and gave nothing at all in it's place. Personally, I think they should've made most of the perks of 1st free to everyone, aside from the private server since those actually cost money to run. It would've made a hell of a lot more sense if 1st was a private server subscription, and maybe doubled the atoms you get from daily/weekly challenges.
---
No, PC exploit only
---
I agree with you completely!
---
Same here but only with abandoned bog town.  Been debating creating a third character to see if the old adage third time's a charm will come into play but just haven't bothered.
---
I've had missile turrets fail to kill dogs and molerats!
---
Absolutely
---
what would be a good addiction debuff?
---
1/3 slower fire/swing or sprinting speed halved, any creative ideas? :)
---
Failnite?
---
While true, if you have a large build camp you have to replace everything, and the more often you move it in a short amount of time, the more caps it will cost!
---
Yes it really does work this way. If your camp is fairly complicated its unikely you can place the blueprint though.
---
Sorry to hear you are having problems. I have a pretty cool setup on a lead node close to sunshine station and I'm using 4 turrets and they are stopping everything that comes close to my camp. My turrets basically killed a lvl 30 Death Claw yesterday by themselves . So I was actually happy about the defense. Ive built a base against a mountain on a cliff. I've built walls around the two exposed sides and put a missle turret on each side. The only way to my camp is from either side the front entrances or falling from off of a cliff into my base. If you can find a mountain to build your base against you can limit the amount of materials you need as your back wall of the base will be mountain. Then you will have a bunch of budget saved to add more turrets and strategically place them so that enemies can't hit them while they can hit the enemies. I find having a v shape building allows multiple turrets to cover multiple angles in this format. This is custom for the location tho so you wouldnt want to constantly move your base as it might be a bad design for another location. If you're on PS4 I can show you my base later today so you can check some design tips to improve your defense.
---
It‚Äôs a great game, you can tell a lot of love went into the map design and the lore. It‚Äôs a shame everything has to get rushed so much and obviously the higher ups are just focused on time and money
---
LW for solo, for teams it‚Äôs actually strange in numbers and magnetic personality. You should be able to share magnetic personality in two-people team, and in 4 people team each member of the team who has magnetic personality shared should be able to share level 3 cards. Poof, bonus 9 points to your SPECIAL when teamed
---
Not yet, but it is still a highly requested feature.
---
There was a bug/feature a while ago where you could place crops in side a camp fire so you could plant them on the roof. Don't know if it's patched out tho.
---
This is so true. Wouldn‚Äôt seem impossible to have cause they all ready exist ingame anyway
---
But you have to restock your vending machine, as well as any displays. What a massive time sink!
---
Yeah camp defenses (and the camp system in general) need some love. I would suggest wiring your missile turrets directly and/or with more than one power source so they don't lose power as easily. Have them raised but not visible from a distance since rifle enemies can hit them unopposed. Heavy turrets are good too since they don't require a power source.
---
To be honest I rarely use any kind of defense since enemies usually only spawn if there's a player nearby (and they'll kill them). If they damage your camp it typically only costs a few wood/steel while camp defenses themselves ironically cost a fortune to fix.
---
There was an even better one were you could plant 3-4 on a small rug, it looked so much neater than the campfire!
---
How do you sew the guns he has?
---
Good to know thanks!
---
What's pram? I haven't heard of a hacked aid item.
---
Yea probably so huh. My camp is definitely complicated that's fur sure
---
Dang, didn't know that. Gonna try this later
---
yeah, only reason i am in here is that you actually grow a set of extra skin that protects you form the toxic spit from the Milurk Kings in game üòÇü§£
---
I think this was patched, I have it done for two of my camps, but not all of them! I found the flower shaped rug was the easiest ot do it with, but it worked on all of them!
---
&gt; NW started well but now it's totally unplayable because of cheaters 
---
Adventure, for pc, risking to go follow‚Ä¶ :(
---
I feel like I'd heard camp system changes were on the "to-do" list. There's a lot of QoL stuff and camp object additions/improvements that could be made. There definitely needs to be more diverse/complicated electrical components as there isn't a very high level of complexity available currently. Think type Minecraft machinery.
---
So nice seeing new players feel the same as i have since pre beta, you have so much fun coming to you :)
---
That's what I always told myself. Why have missile turrets when scorch are always pretty far away sniping my camp all day with a pistol. Very annoying. He can be in plain sight and the turret will just sit there doing nothing. And even if you have that very flat part that looks sandy almost near the whitesprings super mutants can just keep on shooting it all day while theres no obstacles in the way whatsoever. I think the turrets probably need a even better buff where if something is kinda far away and the camp is in danger by the enemy it should be able to shoot it. Either that or invest in adding a sniper turret..
---
Make The Greenhouse Great Again!
---
You'd still have all the objects, you'd have to junk the blueprint and place them all again though :(
---
All turrets, weapons, and armor (power armor especially) need a balance pass. My pipe pistols on my crit build can kill groups faster than "heavy" explosive weapons like the fat man and missile launcher can on my heavy weapons build.
---
I've been blowing up anyone's camps lol
---
Maybe a new chem but definitely not Jet.
---
They nerfed middle turrets into oblivion. There was an update awhile ago on survival where turrets would kill you in one or two shots. Well raiders complained and they were nerfed. I've tried just about everything I can think of to make turrets somewhat effect by mixing them hiding them trying Shotgun Lazer you name it they are all useless.
---
Yeah well the contraptions DLC in FO4 was cool and added a load of stuff like that, would be nice to see all that stuff make a return in FO76
---
I was hoping they remove the mediocre restrictions like "Item is Floating" Intersects existing object", "Item needs Support", etc.
---
As of yet Bethesda has not stated how people will be compensated and no compensation has been given.
---
Yeah that i mean when i say it needs an overhaul, i have never seen anyone say they like or approve of that, it adds nothing to the game and would make everyone happier to see it gone
---
Lmao
---
You have any unstoppables 5 mags for sale? I pay 1k each
---
'Kay
---
I don't know what a pram is as well.  But there is a hacked aid item that is like a syringer ammo and makes you glow pink for 9999 days.
---
Solution, build only in the forest lol.
---
So someone can shoot you and make you glow forever? Or is this something you take like chems
---
With this happening over the holidays it my take a minute.
---
They should've just left a lot alone with survival, then again they got a lot to work on PVP wise
---
I‚Äôve tried to set it up but it just won‚Äôt function properly. Only lets me press A
---
I usually spam the place button and move slightly eventually it will place the item.
---
Another thing that needs attention asap is the CAMP budget. The game has never had a raise in the overall budget ever since BETA.
---
Next time, go with a team. ;)
---
Good to know. Saved me a fruitless effort then lol
---
How do you expect to prove who are real victims?
---
They're still bugged, you need to reconnect them everytime its annoying
---
Yup that's a nope from me then. Gonna stay put as long as I have to so I don't have to do that again. Took me like 5 hours lol
---
Do you get better rewards?
---
I would love an increase but i understand why they havent dont it, ive built hugevsettlements of FO4 and it causes lots of crashes, lag ect...  
---
Increasing the budget would do the same here since they have to take into account the max number of items *possible* in an area, so the max number of camps as close together as possible all built to max budget
---
Afraid not I‚Äôm finishing my own collection first but if I get any duplicates you‚Äôll be the first to know
---
I'm in exactly the same position. I've been all over Beckley on two characters.. still not showing....
---
Please do!
---
I'm just trying to make sure my Hunters does get the buff like zealots. Thanks!
---
Novice is just for you to get aquatinted with the raid. Regular and Expert are the one with good rewards.
---
Why waste ultracite ammo in the vault?
---
It might still work, just harder to pull off, it always too a slight hill to work, might need a steeper one now! the same trick let you place water purifiers onto rugs too!
---
Have you reported the person and provide video proof?
---
:)
---
Its a display glitch. Next time look at you XP under stats in your pipboy. Go and do Queen of the hunt and complete it.
---
Then look at your XP to next level under stats, the bar should have moved slightly to grearly depending on your current level.
---
Im lvl 266 so it doesnt move a lot after completing this but its noticeable.
---
Same here..
---
It says to press R to switch between all friends and team, but which is it set on? Is it set on the one it's showing? It makes me feel like you need to press R to switch TO friends or team.
---
I just hate how some people have giant mansions filled to the brim with decorations and I have basicallt 3 turrets, a bungelow and 4 vendors and im at max budget.
---
A top requested feature since the beta days. But not going to happen, how do you prevent items that are meant for the ground but not garden plots work? Previously you could place garden items and concrete foundations on campfires because of the dirt. They could just ignore people who complain about immersion and let us build how we want especially since we have floating camps already but we going to need some serious support.
---
Side note I want garden plots too.
---
I've had the same experience.  I had turrets for a week and was repairing them nearly every time I fast traveled to my base.  Without them I just need to repair crops and a wall or two maybe once a week.
---
I wait til I'm on a hot server, too. Last night was a good one.
---
Instigating explosive single action revolver and a piece of unyeilding +1 strength combat armor from the queen. Time to hit up the purveyor. 
---
Got a TSE handmade, suppressers explosive combat shotgun, zealots the fixer with crit damage.
---
Had about 600 scrip and came away with some really good guns. I just bought the two and three star options. Not the mystery pick.
---
Same here. We can form an alliance team. :)
---
At least let us stash useless randomly received perk cards somewhere to declusterfuck the list
---
Its pretty easy
---
Hey, at least that armor has AP refresh )))) and reduced falling damage, you can jump down from the Grafton dam escaping from those nasty lvl 10 super mutants )))
---
Seriously though, having read about the effort it takes and the reward it gives I'm not even going to give it a try, at least for now.
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I've got a ton of flux to spare. I'll usually bring my TS lmg and my Furious. 50, both primed, into the vault.
---
You know well they would do that. Without mod support for this game they have to do it all themselves(Bethesda) and they are clearly too incompetent to code given the situations from how poorly this game runs even on Gaming PCs or the random crashes, heck I still get glitched out from reviving after dieing near end of Queen(goodbye loot) or any Public event fight and its been darn well over a year for Bethesda to make this game release level of quality I expected.
---
Enough with these "Enough already" posts, lol.
---
So you can‚Äôt even jump to death after this event, lol.
---
You're right didn't work well solo, but it did spawn a lot more often than my other technique with only one ghost piece of ore.
---
 I'll just stick to other places,l.Thanks
---
Light Wood Laminate, here I come!
---
Yeah, you are suppose to survive on order to continue!
---
Same same, and I just can‚Äôt be arsed to make a second character for that.
---
They were exactly the same in FO4.
---
Pram is a stroller
---
Could explain why my rifle build im working on with 1 unyeild piece had my perception at 21 when its at 12.
---
the one that says next to r it's what you are currently on
---
According to /u/eckserah, one of the well known data miners:
---
&gt; Okay so let's get a few things straight.
---
&gt;
---
&gt; * #1) The hack IS NOT BACK. So far there have been 2 posts about it one of which was removed due to Rule 7 of the reddit. This was someone who heard someone else say that someone took their stuff. If there was an entire group of people at SBQ who lost all their stuff more than 1 person would have come to here or reddit or a discord to talk about it.
---
&gt; * #2) The previous hack is entirely patched. They made it so that the FROM for the items has to be the character that is actually sending the message verified using authentication tokens.
---
&gt; * #3) The previous hack COULD NOT ACCESS PLAYERS STASH. It used the stash of the character using the hack to put the items into. No one is able to access another person's stash.
---
&gt; * #4) While I am 100% certain that the hack is not back I will still go and check every possible method I can think of.
---
&gt; Due to the recent hack people are paranoid and are blaming everything on it even though it IS fixed. Remember people losing items from the vault raids? It does actually happen. If anyone has lost or thinks they have lost items you need to make a support ticket in order for them to find out what happened.
---

Light wood laminate! Light wood laminate!
---
My friend got shot w/ stringer, started glowing. Effect was gone on relog.
---
Bethesda "We went over this already, your not needing to repair stuff enough so we nerfed White Knight for a reason so your request is denied!"

That‚Äôs wrong - the tower I run queens on (not built by me BUT I can verify what has been asserted earlier on this comment) is extremely successful. The queen lands every time on it, and I‚Äôve never seen it fail.  This isn‚Äôt the tower that ‚Äúcaused you to fail‚Äù.  I saw a dozen or so today alone.
---
they said in the latest update in this sub that if you were affected you should submit a ticket to customer support. it kinda implies that the tech support would compensate them what else would they support them with
---
The best is when your camp is fully repaired and took 0 damage in the 6 hours you were playing. And you log out, then the next day when you log in. Bam, stuff is destroyed. (Rolls eyes) whats up  wit dat?!
---
Nice one!
---
I thought solo gameplay was a thing this community wanted, nows its "next time go with a team"? Anyway Im good I dont need a team. Then I gotta carry them
---
because its easier to get ultracite 308 rounds
---
I bought mine for 10k *sobs*
---
Blueprint your vending machines before moving. I put mine on a simple two foundation layout and blueprint them, when you move your camp scrap the automatically made blueprints and then go to the one you made and sit it down, all of your items will still be in your machine and still priced. This doesn't work for display though.
---
Which would you say has the best ratio of time to clear the area to number of spawns?
---
Personally I would love PVE mode that would allow me and group to go event running nonstop, too many servers with no one running them like when Public Events were first released.
---
I live near Blacksburg Va. The closest landmark would be Va. Tech college. Thank you for the kind words

I painted my urban forest, and this combo is sweet looking.

---
i don't like missile turrets, apart from blinding me they are not doing anything useful
---
Im all for a limited time reward  for 10 1st place ranks. But dont think that will keep bush bastards completely out. I've seen plenty of them get to the end and win too.
---
I would much rather it be a recipe you could gather materials for. No need to bring micro transactions into it. Make it expensive to make but doable. Silos are solvable. Nukes can be farmed solo. Can make it require stabilized flux to make it tedious and give some explanation on why you are suddenly way different than you were. Drinking nuked materials would undoubtedly mess you up. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind a cool down on it too. Already have four characters above 50 so it‚Äôs not super needed but would be nice to not have to constantly level a new character to be decent with different builds.
---
Only correct answer in this thread. It's not just queen of the hunt doing this, it's all daily quests. You get rewards etc, they just don't display.
---
I'm pretty sure it's just an issue with the floating damage numbers. Tenderizer modifies the damage taken by enemies, not your damage output.  The numbers seem to show your raw output before enemy damage resistance is factored in.
---
I use them since they are on the roof of my buildings, that way they can cover great distance without getting hindered by any of my camp stuff like purifiers and the like
---
Yes please! Can I add you?
---
No, at least i didnt get anything. Not even a response to my ticket.
---
Never walk through an activated decontamination shower arch without Strarched Genes. It will remove mutations.
---
yeah pharma pharma and can do are really nice perks at any level - I like running a 3 star version of one or the other when I playing around then swapping it to bloody mess when I go to events or vault raids as a kind of dual purpose use of those 3 points 
---
not a fan of scrounger though its nice but I don't feel its really as useful as it should be - I wish scrounger gave me parts for bullets instead of the bullets so I could make the ammo I needed instead of just some random bullets I probably don't need
---
Only way that happened is if you were in a workshop or someone in your team was hostile to them or had a bounty on your head.
---
I use missile turrets and they seem to work fine and kill everything before they can cause much harm. I'm always coming back to my camp and finding meat piles scattered about that I can loot. 
---
I have my missle turrets and 2 spotlights all hooked up to a terminal and the  terminal is powered directly from the generator. Once powered up I go into the terminal and set the spotlight to target hostiles. 
---
The turrets will lock onto stuff and start firing before I even know anything is out there when I'm at my camp working on stuff.
---
For me using the spotlight and terminal makes a huge difference.
---
It kind of looks like the liberty prime skin, no?
---
I teamed a level 4 and dumped him like 200 units of wood and gave him access to the food packaging workshop.
---
the heavy laser turrets work pretty well if you pair them with the search lights as the search light extends the range and accuracy of the turrets near it - I use a heavy laser and shotgun turret for a one 2 punch with a spot light between them and they pretty much keep my base safe from the giant frogs who like to raid me (I hate those freaking egg mines....)
---
Bet you can, by buying the fallout first edition! :D
---
I have mixed feelings on that, as a FO1 subscriber that would be great, but damn that makes resource collection super easy mode.  I can already sense the backlash.
---
They say they want to help the community by improving the game, okay.
---
They add stuff we ask for and ask atoms for it, they implement a much needed bigger junk stash and ask for a monthly subscription.
---
We need a bigger camp budget, we need a better turret targeting matrix since most turrets just plain up ignore stuff. What? Will they implement Fallout 2nd next time.
---
It only affected a small few number of players, there really is no need to compensate anyone, can just farm the materials again /s
---
I really do hope everyone (and from what i can see its alot of players not just a small few as per Bethesdas statement suggests) gets a generous compensation package
---
I saw one response that a user claimed was from Bethesda.  It basically amounted to "We want to make this right, but it's going to take some time."  No specific details were provided.
---
I think 5 of each flux and some strangler blooms would be difficult enough to stop people from doing it constantly but easy enough to be achievable daily if you wanted.
---
And i would like a bigger stash without having to pay monthly.
---
Neither will happen
---
Cant u store and replace turrets with the same effect
---
I mean while they are above ground, tanking missiles to the face!
---
You can, but not when they're destroyed. The game will force you to repair it.
---
Do you use the AGI perk that reduces durability loss? I have it and barely have to repair my armor it seems.
---
One must assume it's quite easy to add, because it's accidentally been done before with rugs and campfires and is probably just a tag of some kind.  And despite this, we've had that greenhouse that doesn't, you know, actually function as a greenhouse.  Or any attempt to add planter boxes.  So, that leads me to wonder why it hasn't been done.  My only guess is that someone is *really* adamant about making sure crops are vulnerable to enemies, and they refuse to sacrifice this sacred cow for some reason.
---
Would love to see a rework, tired of item can't be deleted and being forced to replace my camp and spend caps to do so.
---
Sorry guys, I fell asleep when I put the kids to bed so never gave it away. Giving it another shot tonight.
---
At this point I think most p2w concerns have gone out the window. Besides, it would be pay to convenience anyway.
---
No silly, Fallout 1st will have reduced atoms or more likely they will just charge more for it so expect no Fallout 2nd and get ready to open your wallet to get the new utility freezer chest(in game files already but maybe nothing comes of it like how mailboxes never were released).
---
And it started working again?
---
35k please tell me you are kidding
---
It‚Äôs the holidays dude. There be very minimal staffing, as Bethesda are people too that would like to enjoy the holidays with family and friends.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt expect too much too soon at least till next Monday after the weekend.
---
It still suxs this situation happen on PC tho. But people are gonna have to be a bit patience.
---
Personally I havent seen anything you can juy in this game that would constitute "winning" in any way. It's all just okay for convenience.
---
The whole idea of fallout 76 is that youre always in short supply of at least something. Constantly maintaining weapons and armor with expensive costs. Constantly topping up your tedious food and drink meters and constantly grinding the same locations and missions to get more scrap
---
I tried selling those for 5 caps and nobody even bought them then. Sold 2 once. Finally dumped them all at a train station because they were just wasting vendor space
---
I wrote in my first post.
---
What does this even have to do with fallout 76 and this topic then? Can i hust say "inflatable boat"when someone ask me something?
---
What platform? I may have one...have to check.
---
Responding to someone saying they did not know what a pram was.
---
What they need to do is add more stuff and ask less in return. They gave us a piece of junk, we made it a game because of the community. What they do right now, might as well put up a sign saying "This is Bethesda, send us money so we can try and improve this game while asking for more money."
---
Rockstar sells Shark Cards, Bethesda sells Cosmetics. Gta is a great game, Fallout 76 sucks in comparison. 
---
Right now they plan on adding free Dlc to the game, but at the cost of what? A poorly developed game. I bet they'll ask for budget improvement at the price of a new subscription.
---
It may or may not be implemented similarly (if at all) in FO76, but in ESO, you can buy attribute and skill respec separately for 700 crowns each (the value of 1 crown is about equal to that of 1 atom), and these features can also be paid for with the in-game currency at rededication shrines, the price then essentially scales with the player's level, or more precisely the total number of points they already have. I suspect this kind of item could be added with Wastelanders, there would likely be demand for it anyway because of the balance changes, maybe implemented similarly to the repair kits (get a few for free at first, then either buy it with atoms, or it drops as a - possibly RNG based - reward for difficult end game events).
---
I carry a gamma gun and shoot it at my feet. Pretty handy!
---
Equal to last week. Confirmed Charlie works.
---
actually there were definitely over 1000 people affected as someone could run around and hack lots of people in just an hour. and even if it did affect a small number of people, the hack was able to take items purchased with real money, so those people definitely do need their money back.
---
The problem is twofold.
---
The first is that even if you use spotlights to extend their range, the distance your turrets can detect and shoot enemies is shorter than the enemies that attack them.  So, you get this Scorched or Super Mutant that just hangs out on the periphery, happily plinking away at your succulents and Fasnacht decorations all day long.
---
The second is that enemies also seem to a get an extremely generous grace period before turrets engage them, often allowing them to get right next to the turret before the turret even starts firing, and then it never fires because it gets confused.
---
And Scorchbeasts?  I moved back to the Forest after my CAMP of several months was besieged by Scorchbeasts twice in one day.  There's no dealing with those if you aren't physically there to stop them.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_Wiki
---
Maybe if things were getting carried over into NW then there could be some actual p2w.
---
Sorry my first statement saying its only a small few was me taking the piss, sorry thought that was clear, i was just taking the piss outta Bethesda claiming it was a small few
---
I'm level 150? 160? 158 i think. Eh idk. But i'm always up if you need some help, my Eugene and i are always up to kick some ass. When i can get on anyway
---
Well thanks for the thought-out response, but like I said; some friends think that. It wasn‚Äôt an attack on your almighty Bethesda lol
---
Knowing Bethesda its not
---
imagine a fan defending betheseda
---
Region lock that shit, no one gives a fuck about Russians.
---
Depends on your play style. But if someone is frustrated with constantly repairing armor they may want to look into using this perk card full time is just my suggestion.
---
I live in the forest area so what I end up getting is ghouls, robots, scorched, mole rats or dogs. And they always attack my freaking crops. I'd love to put down a turret or two but they're freaking useless and take up too much budget.
---
More to the point, you *should* practice the raids solo on novice so you can get familiar enough with them to handle the timer with a group. I'm in a similar boat to you, I've finished one of them with another player who carried me through and showed me the ropes and have tried all three a few times solo, but never completed by myself. After I get back from the holidays, I'm planning on just refining my build on doing them and trying to run them every night until I get good enough at them to find a group. If you are looking for someone to run them with you at some point, just send me a dm, my IGN is Ludvillain.
---
Play on console
---
Extractors give 14 per hour. A super mutant with an assault rifle gives 16. How many super mutants can you kill in an hour? If the answer is more than one, you have outgrown extractors.
---
Extractors are worthless, especially in your camp, they just bring in enemies. If you are not on a node, not only do you not take up space with the extractor, but turrets too. So save half your camp budget, and give them up.
---
I'm not sure, since I've never been. It could also just be the typical bugfest that is a Bethesda game lol.
---
Try that same setup in the mire or bog
---

Y'know, Failnite. That shitty game that Fallout 76 tried to copy with the BR mode, so they could cash in on a fad that mostly only 9 year olds play.
---
I love how there's a video of a guy robbing over 500 people with said hack,and by the time of that post,Bethesda was still "investigating" it. Comedy gold.
---
sadly yeah they do
---
The problem I have is my generator is inside my camp enemies spawn in there so my turrets have no chance of shooting them
---
Yes and no. I mean if I leave a workshop undefended usually it gets ran over by mobs eventually. I would assume that if there were permanent workshops, that if I went to work for 12 hours, that the mobs would take over and production would stop
---
There are many items that were available in Fo4 and are already in-use somewhere in Fo76 that we could really need or simply want for our camps but we've seen the asinine decisions by Bethesda for that kind of stuff so I wouldn't get my hopes too high for the moment
---
Popular game bad
---
That's a big "If"
---
More than one person plays this game. Some stuff is solo, some for groups. please dont ask to take away the only real group content because you personally dont like teams.
---
Go look on eBay...
---
Survival only needed a few balancing tweaks to be perfect, I don't know shit about coding, but I've done pvp in games for about 23 years now, and for a Fallout game, while balancing silly perks, and gear is a small challenge, it's not impossible. If they had buffed a few legendary effects,  swapped a few on weapons to go from major, to minor, and vice versa, the legendary effects would have been solid. Then just unnerf the armor repair perks they destroyed to sell repair kits, and tweak the chems, and caps dropped to be slightly lower, and raise the exp for kills, and it would have become the go to for pvp, and leveling.
---
Ah ty for the explanation.
---
You can pay money to get an unarguable advantage.
---
Sure the advantage is usually tiny ( like the repairkits, scrapkits or collectron ), but anything that gives you an advantage in exchange for money is ''pay 2 win''.
---
The fact that Bethesda decided to completely scrap the idea that Fo76 was going to be competitive in any way kinda removes any such problems though. If they introduce shit that give an advantage in NW that would still be p2w though.
---
No, bad game bad. Game that's only popular because it's free, so all the kids play it is fad. I've seen better games, that were more popular die, amd.be forgotten than that shitshow, and once the next fad rolls up, no one will know what Failnite is.
---
Thx for that appreciated
---
Why not?
---
How would that retcon jet? it's not like the effects of jet have been consistent between the games.
---
Unless you are one of the people who believe jet is a post-war creation of Myron, even though Anne Bishop from fallout 2 was addicted to jet before Myron was even born.
---
FO76 was planned to be the "future" Fallout games for a long time, with content updates gradually expanding it over the years. The next mainline release would likely be single player again, but it is most probably a very long way off in any case: first, BGS needs to finish and release Starfield first (I guess at least a year or two), then TES VI (another ~4 years), and only then maybe a Fallout 5 after a few more years. In other words, the best to hope for is that 76 can still be evolved into a reasonable successful title, despite the difficulties so far - the point of the online, live service model is not to have to make completely new games frequently, but rather to build on an existing one for years.
---
And people ask me why I Sneak in CAMPs lmao
---
&gt;Exactly. They stole a dagger with a skin on. They didn't steal the plan for the skin, which is what you bought from the atom shop.
---
Where did he say anything about a plan? Wtf are you even on about?
---
&gt;Since they don't know the plan they can't craft new daggers with the skin, but you can. It's clear that they haven't stolen what you bought from the shop, they've stolen something made using the plan you bought.
---
Again, where dods he say anything about plans?!? Nowhere did he say anything about plans. Why are you making up things to get angry about?
---
&gt;Because you're using a (deliberately?) confusing phrase "atomic shop items" to muddy the waters and bump up the outrage.
---
What? I'm doing nothing of the sort... Are you drunk or just so itching for an argument you're making shit up.
---
If you're talking about juicehead he only mentions atomic shop items in passing more as a warning than clickbait. Lots of people considered atomic skinned items completely character bound. So you're now getting upset someone was trying to warn other players.
---
&lt;Minutemen.
---
Maybe, I assume they would not collect while not logged in, I can't imagine the instance would just keep running.  A lot will depend on the implementation really.

you'll find a lot of information on these sites. some of it might be a little outdated but you should get the idea. if you are on pc and need further advice / help with a quest hit me up. i might not be online today though
---
Yepp. Especially with the armored ranger outfit. Lol
---
How old are you? Lol its a perfectly fine and inoffensive game that its popular with children, it just sounds like you are hating because its popular.
---
This is entirely incorrect, I was getting rewards from the queen at lvl 26. All effort helps. Be it low or high level players. The key is dealing enough dmg to get the loot but even if you don't you are still contributing to the fight and will get that much needed xp to soon deal massive damage to her. 
---
I've played since launch and know every strategy in the book.
---
things like this make me not-so-sad to have 76 installed on my PC but not launched since November
---
Part of code you can decipher to launch a nuke   This one to alpha silo.  You also have Bravo and Charlie silos
---
I ended up scrapping my missile turrets because no matter where I placed them on my roof, they‚Äôd somehow never notice an enemy and never fire on them. It was getting stupid, so I decided I‚Äôd just handle enemies myself rather than waste camp budget.
---
When I first started I couldn't mark a few locations off so between two new alt characters I was able to discover a few other locations. Beth released a patch about 5 months ago that fixed most of the discover locations but abandon bog town seems to have been missed in it because one of my team mates has used 5 characters and it still won't register that he has been there.
---
It's patched out. Haven't been able to do it for months now.
---
Yeah a few people have mentioned abandoned bog town. Just checked mine and yep, it‚Äôs not picked up that I‚Äôve been there either. Sucks.
---
I would love it. I would have soooo many hours to put into building them all up. It would be great.
---
Would certainly count as pay to win, so probably wouldn't be that popular. But at the same time, resource collecting is quite simple once you know what to do, so realistically it would mostly be a chance for 1st subscribers to create their own kingdom.

---
Yeah I dont have anybody to do raids with either (also honestly I mainly just prefer playing solo, but thats not an option if I want the cool rewards from Vault 94...) so I get how you feel. :/ Not to mention the raid was more annoying and frustrating than fun the last time I tried to solo it
---
Recently my turrets haven‚Äôt even been firing at enemies after even being shot at ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
---
Usually on land at the start of my bridge!
---
That sounds fun enough. Encourages two nukes if you can't find enough of each color flux in one area. Time consuming but not super difficult. I like it. Makes it more of a conscious effort rather than a whim. 
---
I like the idea of a gather-able item from the world being part of it. Doesn't just have to be drop a nuke and hunt items. Maybe even make it a multistage thing using a color flux and a world gathered plant item to make a part, then each of the parts come together to make the respec serum. Is it time consuming and tedious? Yes. That's the idea. Your build is supposed to carry some weight with how you play, and I'm perfectly alright with it being an adventure to change it up. 
---
Besides, three days after it was launched they would be for sale on everyone's camps anyway for ridiculous amounts of caps.
---
Does it give you an advantage over other players in a competitive sense? No? No pay to win. It's all okay for convenience as I said. Scrap kits, repair kits, collectilrons, ect cant be used against other players.
---
Look up how to activate the Enclave quest line and dive into that if you're interested in launching your own nukes. Some players enjoy launching nukes, some don't.
---
The whole point of the game is the gathering of resources to use for end-game tasks.
---
Less time spent gathering resources = you getting to spend more time on the end-game tasks, as such you have an advantage. Is it a large difference? No. Is it still a difference? Yes.
---
This is total bullshit. I have played the game since launch and know every strategy of fighting the queen. The "tower" is actually a huge helipad for the queen. I helped the dude build his first and placement was off a bit so he moved it. Not much but he found the sweet spot and I can verify she lands EVERY time as long as we all stick together on top of the platform. Sometimes there are randoms who chase her off into the nuke zone who would actually see it work if they would just come to the platform. *Heavy gunners should run "one gun army" when she lands it suppresses her so she stays down longer and gives melee attackers longer to deal massive amounts of damage.  *the waves of scorched that spawns in will stay on the ground and be there when the queen is dead so you can mop them up later. * The platform works 200% of the time and I, along with all my friends can and do prove it night after night. Queen after queen. It is a proven fact.
---
I had that exact problem. New base, I placed 4 level-2 turrets at the top of a slope where attackers approach, and 2 of the 4 starting shooting each other. I tried moving a few around in the hope of "resetting" them, but the problem continued.
---
I then scrapped 2 of them, and the problem went away. And, to my delight, the 2 seemed powerful enough to take care of the odd ghoul or super-mutant.
---
Agreed.   I no longer defend my CAMP.   I sit in a spot at white spring where local robots patrol. They take less budget and written pretty much as well.
---
The store option is replaced by the repair choice.
---
This happens way too often. Someone said searchlights extend the range, but I can‚Äôt confirm or by how much. Plus that‚Äôs kinda lame to need an extra non-turret just to make them useful.
---
Secret Service or a new Enclave PA
---
To the best of my knowledge, mods only spawn at your camp when someone is there, and 90% of the community will defend your camp for you.  
---
I dont think ive ever made turrets at any of my camps and i have very rarely ever had to repair anything in them
---
I don't see why people would think anything other than submitting a ticket to support would get them any sort of results. If you don't submit a formal complaint you have zero chance of getting a formal response. Just coming to Reddit to rant about how you got robbed and demanding compensation may feel good but it will get you as much as ranting on Reddit about how an electronic device you own just failed and expecting a warranty response. They have no way of knowing what happened to your account if you don't submit a ticket from that account. It doesn't guarantee compensation or reimbursement but NOT submitting a ticket WILL guarantee that you will most likely get nothing.
---
Next time I swap locations I'll give it a go. But I guess out there or would definitely get overwhelmed in the wrong location
---
This, elevators, and roofs
---
Apparently one or two handed is the way to go. But then I can't have a good shotgun build üòê
---
Workshops should be taken off the pvp.
---
Assholes?  You'd paint the community by one dickhead's actions?
---
I‚Äôve played with the idea of removing all turrets, and between cheap repair and less budget impact, it‚Äôs great. However.....mobs have completely destroyed my vendors on occasion and, not that I was probably going to make any, but I hate to miss a sale.
---
Did they lower xp as well?
---
Honestly, I‚Äôd be happy if I could just repair my camp to 100% at any time instead of waiting for things to break. I don‚Äôt swing by too incredibly often and I hate seeing thing at a sliver of health but can‚Äôt do anything about it.
---
Yeah you would be right if what you‚Äôre talking about is the case. But it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs the entire department overseeing fallout 76 that‚Äôs the problem. Not one or two devs. As well as the gaming community and an IT job are miles apart, on one hand you have a triple AAA STUDIO that should be providing its player/fan base actually finished games. While on another you have a single department (IT) that is there to help deal with problems that arise in the company/customers. Yo can‚Äôt compare the two to being the same. The dev team, marketing team, support team, etc. are all a working part of the game. But most importantly it‚Äôs a company you‚Äôre getting a faulty product from. Rather than sitting on your ass and smiling like nothings wrong, you show Bethesda that you want change, rather than spend your money, you show them you want change, sure play the game, that‚Äôs not the problem. The problem is the players get complacent. That‚Äôs when studios do this. When players don‚Äôt hold them accountable. An IT job is completely different scenarios, unless you just want to talk about the support department. The devs already Dread working on it because they know how many game breaking bugs there are.
---
These two types of enemies are why I like to keep an exterminator and a troubleshooter weapon. Coincidentally my best weapon is an exterminator meat hook so I just chew through mirelurks to begin with. Never actually thought about grabbing the perk. I should do that just to laugh at the kings and queens and farm the little guys for dinner.
---
I miss having a place to track mission progress (like a diary or log, stating what has been done) with the respective tapes, notes and special items indexed by mission.
---
After a while it kinda gets hard to remember what belonged to where...
---
Personally that sounds more like, and dont take this the wrong way, you need to improve your build or gear.  
---
To overcome a problem requires you to adapt to the problem, if not, thats the only thing the team is bringing to the table, is other people better adapted to that particular situation
---
i dont play 76 im just wondering
---
You have an interesting perception of time. Private servers are just starting their third month and their list of ideas they plan for the future of private servers didn't come until after the first month. So what you're calling 'ages ago' has really only been about a month ago. Patience grasshopper. It will come when it comes, if they can make it work.
---
Yes nuke zone

Trust me you don't need PA to dodge the rads

fallout has tought me to save water , water is life
---
Yeah, they only patch the bugs we like.
---
There is probably already some kind of internal road map for 2020, this is implied by what was said in the summer interviews (E3 and QuakeCon). If not anything else, smaller bits of content that have been delayed or cut (such as Vault 96, and whatever does not make it into Wastelanders at launch) could be finished and released over the year. Similarly to how work in progress content for Wild Appalachia and Vault 94 was already found in the files in November 2018.
---
The bigger question is whether there would be another bigger (Wastelanders sized) content drop in late 2020 or early 2021. As much as some people here seem to be hoping for that to happen, I do not think the company intends to give up on the game easily (they know how profitable ESO is, and that there is at least like a decade until the next mainline Fallout), but it is yet to be seen what the Wastelanders update is like, and if it is successful.
---
Yikes! Didn't consider that. I have the plans. Maybe try to mod it to heavy combat first, then BoS?
---
You don‚Äôt play fallout 76 yet decide to make comments such as 
---
‚Äú imagine defending Bethesda ‚Äú

I‚Äôve got a bunch of T45 and T51 and T60 plans for sale.  Including a fully equipped T60 torso with stealth boy.   Since I equipped my BOS VII torso with stealth boy I‚Äôm trying to move the other one. Look me up on PS4 if interested
---
I don‚Äôt think you can do that. Heavy is what the queen drops for rewards.
---
You can't change the type of piece, if it drops light then it'll be light sadly
---
I'm wondering the same thing.
---
Triangle foundations and floors, please!
---
Rust and Conan Exiles have these, and it really opens up tons of possibilities when building. 
---
If these ever get added, I'd finally move to the Mire and build a lighthouse in the swamp.
---
50 xp. I love getting duplicates during events. :-)
---
Not exactly. It's a same if you ask me.
---
They don't. And they are not that big. Like the blue glowing one.
---
The only part of my camp that mobs can access are my vendors, copper extractor, and water purifier. I have one missile turret and two heavies. 
---
Mobs never go after my resource collectors. They love to demolish my turrets and vendors. Between super mutants attacking out of range and scorched and DOGS attacking up close, my turrets don‚Äôt stand a chance. Seriously, the dogs typically come in threes. My camp can kill two, usually,  then the turrets break while there‚Äôs one dog left to eat my vendors. 
---
Land is flat and all turrets have clear shot of everything. Very lame.
---
Is this any use to you, not sure I understand the question, sorry https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4sA-lJt2lV5r4NjkGNgyVUGNwjRMLN-ishup58v_Qs/edit#gid=
---
It loads faster, I switch between the 2 and I definitely see a difference
---
That's disappointing to hear. I'm sure their instanced on the same server hardware, i was just hoping without people dropping in and out constantly maybe i could feel a little less delay &amp; random choppiness for no apparent reason.
---
Oh well, 72 resistance isn't shabby, and I'm picking up a perk point. Dropping 30 resistance isn't too bad.
---
Build a vending machine, your camp becomes basically imortal
---
Okay, i think its a misunderstanding. I never had any problem with my private server,  thats why i said its a same. Its smooth and good to play on it.
---
Hey dude. I'm the guy with the platform. She lands every time. I've likely killed between 2k and 3k queens at this point. I can kill her myself in about 20 seconds. The platform works. The hordes spawn.
---
Thx, I'll give them a miss  if they don't snap. You saved me 700 Atoms :D
---
pixelblondie just replied &amp; said they do not
---
Sounds like you aren't using spotlights
---
If you check out YouTube,  Angry Turtle has a video of a solo run and he tends to ignore a lot of the mobs,  the key is to know where the pipes are
---
Legs break super fast if you like to jump off cliffs too. Not just talking about power armor here. Bird Bones, Goat Legs and fall damage reduction armor piece(s). You can literally leap from the tallest buildings and walk away like it's nothing when you have them on. It's funny because I have healing factor as well, and my buddy jumped behind me in power armor to pick me up when I died and by the time he hit, I had already healed back to full health and was laughing watching him slam into the ground like a 2 ton weight.
---
I wonder if they intended for them to snap together ü§î
---
Please don‚Äôt tell me you ran it in ‚Äúnovice‚Äù difficulty.
---
The other thing he does is cripple the ghouls so they Don‚Äôt   respawn
---
That overdew sundrew grove has a tendency to spawn 3* legendaries. It's always worth taking a run in there after its been nuked.
---
Oh. Depending on the time of day, i just noticed a smooth experience in a public adventure early in the AM, but i was lagging and chopping all over the place in the early evening. Just wish it could feel a bit smoother all the time.
---
sadly, i can confirm.
---
Not nearly as easily as slapping on some xo1.
---
From when I played random low levels always seemed to want to pick a fight with me for some reason, possibly because I was eating corpses and they mistook me for a ghoul?
---
Either way I would eat them alive
---
Less lag as well picking things up etc.
---
The restrictions on the CAMP are so aggravating I spend a lot less time on mine than I normally would.  Shame, because it could be the most fun.  I mean, remember what a complete mess it was, undocumented and weird, in FO4 at start, then people made masterpieces there.  
---
My best experience with CAMPs now is seeing the wonderful stuff people do with theirs.
---
Was deployed overseas
---
No they don‚Äôt but I believe they should
---
Ive heard from friends that gun fu works in private servers. No lag on switch between targets.  I play PC public servers and I have a tiny lag on switches.  Other than this I do not really have FPS problems or lag on PC.
---
Run zealot stuff for the queen. Hunters has no extra effect.
---
It was already patched.
---
I find the cryolator is actually more of a hindrance than a help.
---
Just adding that yes, that is what they are for but unless you like making a pain in the ass for yourself, go to the nukacrypt website and look up the codes for the week. That way you don't have to find and decipher the codes yourself.
---
Aahhhhh nuts. Lol. See what I mean, so many different answers. I'll hafta swap out my prime Hunters for a Zealors then just to be safe I guess.
---
Fantastic! Thank you!
---
Huh....I hadn‚Äôt thought about doing that. Sounds useful, although it would also mean switching weapons and using ammo when I need to drop to 20%. Might lose some time that way. Whatever the case, I‚Äôll give this a test run cause now I‚Äôm curious!
---
I use PS4 there is an app that you can use to connect to the game via a tablet out phone, I just fire up a few workshops, then do whatever I have to do.. had the ammo factory and Charleston running for around 8 hours yesterday.  Just need to keep an eye in what‚Äôs happening and nudge the controller occasions,my
---
If you've got the atoms, grab the Thanksgiving display shelf before it leaves the shop.  Fits 8 items instead of 6, and there's no dirty glass
---
1 week.
---
Does the player that picks the lock not become wanted?
---
If you've got the atoms, grab the Thanksgiving display shelf before it leaves the shop.  Fits 8 items instead of 6, and there's no dirty glass.
---
What kind of weapons are you specced for and are you on PSN? between myself and the dudes I run with we can probably come up with zealots replacements for you.
---
Cool
---
You could do it on a campfire or rug, but sadly it‚Äôs been patched.
---
Massive difference, but I have only had it since the hack a few days ago. Way better, not perfect but 100% on even a relatively empty public server
---
i'll check it out, thanks, but i hope i will get to try it with an experienced team :)
---
One dick created the hack. A multitude of assholes downloaded it.
---
MERRY MOTHMAS
---
Luckly im in the forest but it sucks when a scorched with a pipe pustol destroys my walls.
---
Or even the mole rats destroying my VERY small garden I have.
---
so, i shoot them in the knee? :P
---
On Xbox. I'm a non auto rifleman with VATs. Have a Hunters Handmade I use for queen fights. 
---
My strategy is clip her wings woth an AA Lever I have so she'll land for everyone. Go on mob control with my plasma rifles. Then when clear use my prime Handmade to sneak headshot queen and keep clipping limbs best i can.  I try to keep adds clear for the melee people in the bunch. And my buddy who uses heavy guns dealing a lot of damage. Then my finisher is an executioner plasma rifle ffr.
---
At least you didn't get a drill...it now hangs proudly on my wall along with the three star rolling pin I also got from a vault raid run.
---
thanks
---
Let's put it this way: 200 DR is feasible without wearing any armour at all, so nothing but a rad suit will technically suffice in a nuke zone. Armour with lead lining or the rad resistance legendary effect combined with radx or (preferably) radshield will have the same or better DR than X01
---
A full set of legendary or better is preferable to power armour for most builds, especially punching weapon users
---
Difference is not ‚Äòmassive‚Äô for me but it is huge for playing the raid. Expect normal game crashes though, as not every stutter/drop is due to network
---
Could i get your specs/settings? I have an 8700K @ 5ghz, GTX 1080 and 32GB of ram, and i'll randomly get FPS dips from 60-45 while not doing anything crazy. 
---
The biggest issue i have is just the delay i feel when i'm shooting something. Like i'll hit a scorched, and .5-1 second later his head pops off or whatever. Just pulls me out of it.
---
They never worked. Real pieces of shit. I think of them as decoration: if they go with the style of your camp, use some. Some of them look good.
---
I had rubberbanding happening earlier today, so I decided to join a public server for a bit so I could start a fresh private server. It is stable and has faster response for the most part.
---
It‚Äôs pronounced:
---
Mhmhmrmhmhmrrgggmmmmurrrggghhhhrrrrhhhrrr
---
May have to give it a shot myself then. Don't have any friends playing and i'm still learning so i'm playing Solo 99% of the time anyways.
---
They do. This guy had his buddy with him to kill him and take the bounty and make him no longer wanted. I'm guessing they probably were splitting the gifts they were stealing.
---
Who‚Äôs ready for 500 Atoms?
---
Yeah man I just started couple days ago, been playing when I‚Äôm home from work, I‚Äôm also lvl 21.
---
My GT: captive scholar
---
Xbox?
---
The plan is a drop from the SBQ, you‚Äôd probably have better luck finding someone to mod them for you. What platform are you on?
---
I had one of my standard turret shooting the santatron
---
Thanks dude üëç
---
Yep.. nothing beats a good kneecapping
---
Wow I care so much
---
I have no budget for turrets with my current build, but I've had very few issues. Granted I'm in a low-level area (by Charleston Fire Station) but it is easy to repair when things get damaged
---
This\^\^\^  
---
If you prepare for a double XP weekend by stocking up on INT and XP boosting items (Cranberry Relish, INT and Leader Bobbleheads, Berry Mentats and Brain Bombs), and use a full Unyielding Armor set for the INT boost, and then dedicate yourself to leveling up all 4 days of the weekend while running an efficient route, you can easily gain over 100 levels in one double XP weekend... I recently went up 103 levels (198 to 301) on the last weekend.
---
I'm in heaven. No griefers, I just wander &amp; can properly look at stuff because I'm not so focused on weight management (because of the the scrapbox). It is much more immersive. I capture workshops &amp; keep them for the first time.
---
I bought a month, I never intended to keep it. I just wanted to be safe from the hack over Christmas. But I fell in love with the game in a way that I hadn't before.
---
That mirelurk king sound still makes me panic on my level 168 character. If you don't like those suckers quickly, they'll demolish you.
---
I see what you did there lol
---
Some higher level perk cards give 100xp as well, but most are 50.
---
Bummer. I have a 3* zealots ffr handmade I could give you.
---
Keep shredding queens, my dude!
---
Yeah!
---
Sounds like we encountered a failed copycat tower indeed
---
It has, but it‚Äôs all been explained. The BoS is the only thing close to lore breaking and it‚Äôs clearly explained in the lore. They‚Äôve retconed a fuck ton of stuff, but they did the same thing in 4 and that games canon.
---
I have no defence and while I get spawns every time I log in or a friend fast travels to my base for the first time - I don‚Äôt get the horde wave attacks that others seem to get. 
---
I  semi-convinced that the amount of defence level you have increases the amount of mob aggression and spawns in a bit of a holdover from fallout 4.
---
I had some rubber-banding the other day myself.   Which was weird.  Was playing on 1 toon everything was fine.  Switched toons and came back to rubber-banding.
---
Why don't you wear the Excavator suit to battles with high end enemies?
---
So you admit that its lay for convenience... that's basically all you just said. You dont get anything other than saved time.
---
As far as I know, almost all FO1st will tell you "It's like a different game", you can as well check some videos about it, since some if not all laggy stuff comes from public servers - camps.
---
I see it as a trade off to be honest, each turret takes up @6% of the camp budget, so you are using ~18% of your camp budget to not have to repair a wall or garden every once and a while, the crops also take up a lot of space compared to other items, I personally would rather have a camp almost twice as big and just have to repair a wall here and there instead of having a few turrets (which IMO dont really help anyway)
---
Ugh I dont want to start the math!
---
&gt; I capture workshops &amp; keep them for the first time.
---
Sorry still learning. What do you mean by this? There is stuff to capture?
---
They need to change the distance at which enemies can detect your camp as well, it‚Äôs so annoying getting your camp slowly disassembled by a scorched with the longest range pipe pistol in the game
---
One thing to keep in mind is that if they rollback a account that got bandit-robbed it *might* also rollback your items. 
---
I will defer to anyone who knows better of course - but - if it‚Äôs an overwrite from a previous backup and not a record merge *(which could be trickier at scale)* it has the chance to overwrite. 
---
I really want to help a friend out but until he/she hers from BGS it‚Äôs tough to say whether I will add to the pain.
---
Makes me miss my carpet corn
---
saved time is still an advantage you know.
---
Or would killing something in half the time not be an advantage as it is also just ''saved time''?
---
Right on!! Thanks
---
Gt: algaris
---
Tjay would be higher damage so it's not comparable
---
Looks like a X01 with some Liberty Prime assets + Scout mask, and yeah, I said Liberty Prime since Liberty Prime is fat as fck all around. 
---
Let's just wait for release, Bethesda will have a hard time releasing a full "new" PA since almost all cool designs were taken by F4 modders (That's fine), but right now, if the full armor has that mask.. big no for me.
---
sunBroCourier
---
I'm still learning the basics of the game but some down to play 
---
I may or may not have a mic depending if my wife is asleep, she's an exceptionally light sleeper
---
This explains it better than me. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Workshop_(Fallout_76)
---
You defeat the enemies then pay 25 caps or something to take the workshop. You can set up extractors to mine resources like lead &amp; acid. Periodically the enemies take over &amp; so you fight again &amp; each time you get xp &amp; &amp; a plan &amp; stimpaks &amp; resources &amp; stuff.
---
You can also set up a Santatron in each workshop so you can quadruple or more your gifts
---
Did people who got hacked got their item back ?
---
I will when they give me a product I can no longer enjoy. 
---
I held blizzard accountable for making me regrind pvp gear every single  season. I lived in the battle grounds I hated arena, you had to have the gear earned in arena in order to be competitive in battlegrounds though. I didn't care about anything else in their game I was bored with everything else. so I stopped subscribing and uninstalled. I complained a little first on the forums etc but I was ignored. at the end of the day all you can do to hold a gaming company "accountable" is stop playing their game. but I like 76. they are offering a product I enjoy. the hacking douchebaggery just comes with any game thats online if I ever get fed up and cant find fun in the game any more I will tell them and uninstall and hold them accountable. as it stands right now I still love the hell out of the game overall despite its many glaring faults. I love cheeseburgers too. not the best food for your body but I will stab a mofo over a good cheeseburger. kinda the same with 76, I know its not optimised by a long shot its just so delicious I put up with it anyway. and bacon; so bad for you; but damn its bacon man.
---
My turrets seem to be friends with the Super mutants across the riverbed taking potshots at my camp, but are pros at annihilating approaching cats
---
I think you mean calibrated shocks
---
Cranberry Glade still won‚Äôt work for me on multiple characters. Despite it being my go to tame spot
---
are you referring to calibrated shocks? it took me forever to find and learn that plan
---
I'm paadomo on PS4, I am only like level 11 now and new to 76, but I'm trying to make some friends in the game as well.
---
They added the mothman cult instead.
---
I agree with you and zanar
---
I actually seem to crash more often in private sessions.
---
im guessing because it has the weakest Damage and energy resist of most other power armors, even if the carry weight bonus is useful to say the least
---
Console Master Race
---
Seems like I do. Not all the time though.
---
LMAO I didn't even notice the pun I made until you mentioned it
---
Camp restrictions were made with the least amount of fun in mind, they make things look ugly, don't add to realism, are frusterating and the rulea are inconsistant but highly enforced and make the camp system janky.  The clipping of items is also often stupid.
---
They looked at modders of FO4 settlements and said "Nope, none of that plz"
---
It took a lot of outcry to get wallpaper.
---
Great spreadsheet! Thanks.
---
Thanks for that ..That‚Äôs given me something to think about .. I‚Äôve been on a lead resource for months and been thinking of abandoning it. 
---
I get a nice steady 14 lead an hour but a daily run to Charleston and Flatwoods gets me about 10 hours worth.. if I go to the penitentiary as well I can get over 200 lead.
---
Also 14 lead an hour is nothing compared to the amount of rounds I use in that hour..
---
I‚Äôd probably do better moving my camp to an area with water and selling purified water.
---
well look whos taking their video games seriously aka not having enough attention aka u
---
 Still a lot easier to jump in x01.
---
Get out of here.
---
The brahmin feed takes up a lot of budget since it's a resource :(
---
oh sweet!
---
Yea, im not a huge fan of Scrounger. I usually only use a couple of weapon types (melee build). Thats to hit queens or just regular SB. Phamra at the beginning though is my jam. And if you get a ton extra you can vendor them to the people or to a bot.
---
That's probably a good guess but I'd still like to hear OP's reasons :-P I haven't noticed any real difference between using an XO1 and an excavator suit at SBQ battles, and I'm curious to hear more about the options they've explored
---
The best "defense" is turning off your vendors. No one can fast travel to or find your camp. No one has any caps right now anyway lol, wrapping paper caps sink.
---
It happens to me everytime I spam an item (Food or water, mentats, etc). It just crash the game if I click them too fast. 
---
It's kinda annoying but seems like they can't fix that, or dont care bout it.
---
Except for the quests that require another player. Zenimax already learned that lesson, and changed some ESO quests that required, for example, multiple people to stand on multiple switches.
---
You're a natural!
---
Scrap lever actions to learn it.
---
That would just be following the lead of sensical battle royals. Nuclear Winter needs to crave out its own nonsensical path
---
You have to build and scrap other lever rifles to learn the mods. There is no plan for the Suppressor.
---
I wish they were so easy to come across. üòâ
---
It doesn't have as good of resistances I would guess
---
You should copy and paste your detailed response, but make it bold.
---
From what I‚Äôve read they can still add items to your inventory though, some of which can trigger a ban from the old item duping glitch days
---
Ok, does it matter if I craft the most basic lever and scrap often.
---
Buy the plan and make them to scrap.
---
True ... thank you for updating
---
In 6 months time when they get back to me asking for more details again I will 100% do that xD
---
Yeah that would be a pain in the ass
---
Sorry about newb question. Do any specific robot vendors do this plan or just search player vendors.
---
Ok: I'd still rather hear OP's reasons, even if your guess is accurate (I put a higher value on first-hand accounts and personal experiences than I do speculation, lol)
---
Its for later on, as others have said. The end of the main quest (currently). You collect 8 code pieces for the silo you want to launch a nuke form and need to decypher the code... or cheat and look up the code online. Either way it‚Äôs end game content.
---
It's been about a year since I've played, but at least back then, the game basically forced you to choose between having any defenses and being a CAMP that wasn't basically just a shack. Budget either needs to be raised or defense budget cost needs to be lowered drastically.
---
You've never speced somone and see what guns they use without picking anything up?
---
We leave it open so she doesnt glitch out and stop landing, like she has a tendency to do over by Drop Site. That gives the melee players their chance at bopping her as well.
---
It does not matter. Build the lowest and then turn around and scrap them. You will start to learn the mods.
---
Yeah I kinda gave up on it as well.  Like you said, the missile turrets seem to do shit for damage, and even on my roof I constantly get enemies that just waltz up to the walls and then the turrets stop firing.  I come back to a hole in the wall, luckily my base is a large inner room and I put an interior turret on top of something in the middle of the room, and I set my power up on the third floor.  
---
The wacky thing though is the enemy spawns seem just random, they come from directions that aren't near any enemy camps or locations.
---
Also the worst is the random scorched or super mutant plinking away with a rifle in the woods while the turrets stay silent.  
---
It's basically been a mess this whole time.  You go from completely useless normal turrets to still useless high end turrets.
---
Thanks for your help, appreciated üëçüëç
---
I'm pretty sure the robots sell it. It's called Lever Gun.
---
Then why are you here?
---
The BoS began around 2082. Maxson actually broke from the government and military prior to the war. There is no ‚Äòbreaking‚Äô of lore by adding in the new information that Maxson made contact with Taggerdy. 
---
Adding in new information isn‚Äôt ‚Äòretconning‚Äô. 
---
Star Wars Ep V added in new in new information about Luke Skywalker‚Äôs parentage. That‚Äôs not a retcon; that‚Äôs new information. 
---
A retcon would be something like changing Barbara Gordon from being James Gordon‚Äôs daughter to his niece instead. 
---
Retcons can break lore. New information doesn‚Äôt do that automatically.
---
Guess I was lucky then. Took me "only"  one and a half month to get my lost scrap replaced. With ALOT of fighting forward and backwards telling me that I didn't lose anything while they at the same time couldn't explain to me why my stash had no junk. :/
---
Yes, but off hand I don't recall.  Maybe the one in Harper's ferry or Watoga.  Pretty sure one in WS has it, think every plan is now available there.
---
Loads faster for me. My C.A.M.P. pops in way faster and I don't experience many crashes. I only really go on public now a days just to shop.
---
My camp is up on the mountains far from any spawn points except for a fissure site. Whenever the resident scorchbeast comes near, it is shot out of the sky pretty effectively with only two missile turrets. Maybe they are more for flying enemies?
---
Honestly I play alone mostly due to my time constraints of playing. But I do rock on the psn so if you wanna add me cool, I‚Äôm always down to vaults and Dungeons when I have the time available. I will admit I am still in the ‚ÄúI need this, and this, and this... wait... wasn‚Äôt this room full of scrap when I started???‚Äù Player mindset lol
---
glowstick66
---
That's actually kind of hilarious that you mentioned dropping a base for the queen fight.  I've never thought of having a small enough one where you could just do that.
---
You know those atom shop purchases can just be crafted again right? For free
---
I hit 597 last night.  Not impossible.
---
And you think this behaviour would only occur in FO76?  Or you think this would happen on other games?
---
Ok it took you getting to level 200 to safely do this that hardly sounds easy, slipping into a rad suit is cheaper than x01 and it doesn't effect mutations at all
---
I'm actually the one that discovered that method some months ago (or at least I was the first to youtube and post about it). Unfortunately, last I checked it only "kind of" worked and didn't fit many plants as neatly. You could do the same thing with planters and a few other camp objects, not just rugs but it mostly stopped working when they patched the stacked foundations sadly.
---
If you have or can unlock the perk super duper, make sure to equip it first for a chance at 2 guns for the materials price of one.
---
My missile turret kills something always... my freaking brahmin! all the time. I have to store it, log out, and put it up again.
---
I used those codes again with success.
---
They have already stated that the main character you started on after a certain patch will not be able to complete the areas that didn't complete. You have to have made a character after patch 11, i believe, in order for it to clear. I had the same issue with Grafton Dam. Tried two different characters made at different times. After the patch, made a new toon and boom. Used her for all my incompletes. Location, disease, and mob kills.
---
You can‚Äôt submit them anywhere. When you get a duplicate card it is consumed and you get a ticket and XP for them. With your tickets you can go into your perks and select ‚Äúshow unowned cards‚Äù and purchase cards with your tickets.
---
What exactly was the issue? I‚Äôve only had to contact them once and my issue was resolved in 24 hours, admittedly it was an easy thing to address
---
I've not come across that one yet but will keep an eye out.
---
Why the hell should it be easy to just waltz  in and wreck someone's base when they have invested time and resources into fortifying it? It shouldn't. In fact is should be pretty much impossible. Same goes for workshops.  If a player has put the resources into building up turrets, anyone who contests the place should be turned into a meat pile in seconds.
---
I don't use the silver one often so I wasn't really paying attention. Thanks for the correction.
---
Poor rewards has been a thing forever, hasn't it?  Weren't we getting a stimpak and 4 crossbow bolts from SBQ for the longest time?  If the rotating arrows of doom went away that is.
---
Its a luck perk but I'm not sure at what level it unlocks.  Google should have the answer for you though.
---
They've seemed more useful as alarms, and maybe trackers. When I'm working on stuff they let me know when there's something that needs killing. I can follow the bullet trails to find what needs killing. Loot, scrap, get back to work.
---
Is the hack still active?Like not patched?
---
Could also be when they dropped down some of those holiday patches and such it messed up the fix they did for the challenges. I would report it to them, just so they will know.
---
\*\*Does mothman worship dance and waves hands in the air\*\*
---
Please don‚Äôt ask for bad stuff like this. 
---
Take a moment and reflect on how much this would divide and piss off an already incredibly sensitive player base. 
---
It‚Äôs some real monkeys paw shit my friend. 
---
**Pay for your skins and gaudy camp objects all you want. Support the Devs and Art team that way.**
---
# Stop asking for core mechanics to be monetized. 
---
*It‚Äôs fairly classist and ignorant tbh.*
---
For latency, I get less lag.  I can experience the difference while I'm getting dirty water from water sources.
---
No and you get a limit not based on camp budget. Pretty pissed about the purchase.
---
Personally I'm worried that the compensation will be just a dump of Purveyor scrip and/or a few hundred Atoms. This would end up killing everybody that was a victim of the hacking train wreck.
---
It's typically one of the last mods that unlocks from crafting so you better have a good stock of screws and such.  If you are on PC I could do it for you at some point in the meantime until you unlock it yourself if you are going to go that route.
---
* certain glasses - not all of them work
---
Wait did they patch out the pickpocket hack?
---
when will the +250 damage resistance when reloading bug be fixed ??? didn't the money-hungry beings of bugthesda want to fixxen it 3 weeks ago?
---
Ok thanks I thought there was a terminal or something
---
I honestly don't give a damn if it's true or not.    Defenses should work. Period. And that is what we call  a workaround. People use workarounds because something is broken. It should not be broken to begin with.
---
Yeah I gave up on having a nice base after like 2 weeks of gameplay and just made a utility box. Fuck making something nice only for the game to cheese it away from you every time you leave for 10 minutes.
---
As always it‚Äôs kinda a giant tease with those screenshots. 
---
It‚Äôs annoying as hell but so far they have no qualms about teasing content or functionality that we do not have. 
---
IMHO I believe it‚Äôs because the atoms shop team works off of the latest internal Wastelanders build to pose and take screenshots and therefore a bigger sandbox / more toys then we have atm.
---
I submitted a ticket yesterday, Christmas day, and got a response in less than an hour. I replied and got another response in less than an hour again and was able to resolve my issue. I guess I got lucky it sounds.
---
But if they say that the cryolator is the overseer‚Äôs personal experiment and in this game they‚Äôre everywhere.
---
They sometimes screw up.

Enjoy the fruits üçâ while it lasts

Problem with the rad offers no DR/ER.  Big difference. X01 is 370 RR, not 200.
---
What you are talking about is a workaround, which is only needed because something is broken and not working like it's  supposed to.  Well its shouldn't be broken to begin with.
---
I've found it at the Lewisburg station vendor.
---
Agreed
---
Actually I think all floor units should snap to other floor units including "foundations." Upper floors only snap today to stairs which is weird and buggy. Roofs only snap to one side of walls which is also a pain. Lots of improvement opportunities here.
---
thx for answering :)
---
That is sucky
---
Imagine how many times I saw people claiming Bethesda to be the WORST company of this year. 
---
Meanwhile, they fix a hack between 24 hours, can we talk about VALVE with CSGO? \^\^
---
Nope! All in your pipboy :)
---
Rule 9
---
Nope. Just bored with you now.
---
You lost your temper, not me.
---
I'm a camp builder, this is a way of keeping your machines stocked while moving. I'm sure this is working like it's supposed to.
---
Nope
---
if its a bug with crates and skins nobody should really care

I found them really helpful submitted Monday fixed by Wednesday very apologetic and understanding. üëç
---
I'd like it to not be impossible to take a work shop but yeah I agree if someone spent the time and resources to build it up it should be at the very least difficult. Balance is the biggest problem I've had with 76 since the beginning. And I only see it getting easier and easier as time goes on.
---
Super Duper is a lv 50 skill iirc. It was the first perk I wanted to max when I hit lv 50 on any of my characters.
---
okay i will be on later today, as its hard to get on from work.. also let me get few things for u and hope it helps :)
---
Lmao. Good luck being a worthless narc.
---
Do you know if Bethesda bans for the use of any mods? Because I've really been wanting to try out the perk loadout mod, but I'm not willing to lose my account lol
---
Tell me rule 9 when your xbox or ps4 community gets there stuff taken bud.

The plan is sold by Vendor Bot Chad at Camden Park.

It‚Äôs also a small row boat

Thank you for naming and shaming the scum

I don't think the engine could handle a World War Z style horde.
---
It‚Äôs an actual drop for Christmas but still pretty rare. That‚Äôs a great deal. I haven‚Äôt got one yet myself
---
&gt;budget 
---
issue is with that, they should of make it less more  budget  when comes to turrets, where it does not count at all.. having  turrets could help and yet should be use lot then taking to much room
---
I doubt they are. Sorry Mack. I fee yah.
---
When you try do plop down your fully assembled camp in a new location, the camp is impossible to place 90 percent of the time.  You have to disassemble everything and when you do that, your vending machine is no longer stocked.  So no, it doesn't work at all.
---
Just making sure the event that took place a day ago doesnt happen again.
---
Does this work? I have this quest bugged on my main for many months and would like to complete it for my chance at the shielded casual plan. Very frustrating.
---
I love how you PR guys at Bethesda are trying to save your ass by downplaying it with this ‚Äúaffected a few players‚Äù bs. The exploit is so remarkably simple that it looks like the guys in the demo vids are just running around with the command on a macro, so they can spam it at anyone they wish. And after that post where someone was encouraging people to by Fallout First to use a private server, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this was some sort of money grubbing thing from inside Bethesda itself.
---
If you don‚Äôt want to take time to actually defend your camp, put it in a noob zone like the forest
---
Well I don't have a desire to pay for skins (like in fortnite) nor do I care to pay for 1st to build elaborate camps (although I appreciate those that do).  I have my first character and a mule that could really benefit from a respec and it would support the game monetarily.  Not sure how that is classist.
---
I wasn't specifically talking to or about you but it speaks volumes at how fragile you're being that you went straight into calling me names over both of your replies to my comment. I'm not interested in anything you send me because it couldn't be clearer from that what kind of redditor you are.
---
Workshops are the perfect reason for PVP in this game.

PS4 but thanks for kind offer

In other news, rain is wet.

Lmaooooo you can‚Äôt sue anybody because your wittle items went away. It‚Äôs a video game. Try to calm down.

Helps if you post your platform. Have a few I run v94 with on ps4.

That is very kind if you don't mind?

Sure what‚Äôs your psn?

I surprise myself at times lol

I agree lol

When you receive a duplicate, it automatically turns into overseer tickets. 1 for per red card, and 4 per golden card. When you look at your perk cards in NW, the number of overseer tickets you have is in the bottom right corner. When you scroll through the unused perks at the nottom, there should be options to "show unowned cards", and another to "purchase card" displayed at the very bottom (different commands based on platform). Prices of cards range from 3 - 10 overseer tickets per card.

You?

My friends and I have noticed that enemy spawns happen faster on private worlds. More enemies appear than on public worlds, so events like AWOL Armaments are more difficult. The private world experience will put your team to the test since you don‚Äôt have any random high level players joining up with you in events. Launch prep for missile silos is way more challenging since a ton of robots load in to fight. Sometimes on public worlds we‚Äôre just waiting In the control room for a robot to come in. I still prefer public worlds, but there are some wonderful things about the private worlds. I did Mischief Night with only my friends on a Private World and it was just awesome.
---
If it's overly complicated it will be difficult to impossible to put down as a blueprint. I was simply telling the person I responded to a way to keep their machines stocked. Have a nice day.
---
It doesn't matter what location out there, a single cave cricket will end your turrets.
---
Camp defenses really need a buff to cope in the higher level areas.
---
Have pmd you
---
The spotlight helps, I've found.  I've got a CAMP that's built on a narrow ledge, so there's only two approaches that mobs can take, and the combination of a spotlight and a handful of turrets is pretty effective.
---
I prefer commando especially for boss fights, but rifleman is fine.  I would recommend a semiauto Bloodied Handmade, The fixer or combat rifle for times when multiple enemies get close.  Also ditch the TS lever for A bloodied or Instigating when you can.
---
hey, if you just do it 4 more days in a row you'll be able to craft a piece of armor that will likely be useless as well!
---
I play on PS4 too. My issue is I was never into build or anything so don‚Äôt really have one.
---
Lol what a joke, and people are still praising bugthesda after that ? Even on wow back in the early days if someone deleted your character you could asked and they'll always have backup, same with every bit of item or gold that could have been transferred to nay other acc
---
I guess it really depends on what you're asking.
---
I'm gonna buy 5/18ths of the white paint version of the Power Armor!
---
Calibrated Shocks has a very low drop chance from Scorched Earth
---
I have 10 missile turrets. They'll eventually kill a single ghoul once it's gotten into melee range. After that they like to gang up on the pylon THAT POWERS THEM.
---
I've only had one, recent experience, and the support person texted me just a few minutes after I opened the ticket. After a short text conversation, they said they would resolve it, and sent an email confirmation.  All told, 10-15 minutes from start to finish?
---
It sucks you had such a problem, maybe the type of issue?
---
Lol either you just deleted your comment swearing at me or automod just did. Which ever it was: you just proved my point above. I've no interest in taking anything you say seriously. Merry Christmas.
---
I'm SevenBKM on Xbox 180 something on Adventure and 25 on NW. Might play an hour or two after work on weekdays, but mostly play on Weekends.
---
online or offline, i just hope they stick with the real-time VATs system. Older fallouts feel painfully slow now when every kill takes longer than a fraction of a second
---
Nope, just walking around and got one shoted.
---
The player base is full of useless shits who cant find friends from normal people.
---
Hard to say.  It makes sense that the blue neon letters snap because they look like they were intended to flow together, but at the same time, then can be a pain to place because of this.  Some of the more interesting uses of these pink letters, or the light bulb letters before them, are being able to make words look "b^(o)u^(n)c^(y)."
---
Do they count towards the limited "lights" budget then, instead of items? Hrm, was debating if I should get them, as all of the other christmas stuff sucks.
---
Plenty that did though
---
Unless you‚Äôre near a resource node, pack up and move to the forest. The only trouble spot I have at my camp there is enemies spawning right behind my garage where my generator is. They‚Äôd try to break the wall to get to it, but that all stopped once I put down a single shotgun turret.
---
The amount of help and responses within an hour is superb.

Don't go on Reddit much until now.

Thanks all üëç

Auto mod must have, you say the comment wasnt aimed at me but it obviously was or you wouldnt have said it, I just gave evidence and you were too much of a child to admit you were wrong

Forgotten what?

The rest of this post, apparently.

Similar yes, no buying stuff off walls tho

sorry I hit post but accident.  I edited, thank you

yeah I derped up

Yep

&gt;Marxist-Leninist

I mean you kinda deserve it
---
They've been vague about it. If you look at the modding site they try to answer this question. Bethesda doesn't support their use but doesn't oppose it either. They say mods aren't supported and may cause instability in the game. However. I've never ran into issues using them.
---
I don't recall anyone getting banned on here for it.
---
&gt; After that they like to gang up on the pylon THAT POWERS THEM.
---
Exactly!  Enemies just waltz right up to the pylon and wipe it out, thus cutting off your defenses.  If defenses worked properly, they'd be turned to a pile of ash before they got anywhere near the pylon.
---
I get lvl 1 spawns at my camp and that's okay, but a naked player shrugs off every defense I have.
---
*The cost of turrets to the budget makes having them useless.*

The cost of having this game makes having this game useless.

So even console isn‚Äôt safe

My opinion= worthy of harassment. NO.

 The enemies aren't targeting the pylons. The turrets are targeting the pylons.

Bethesda nerfed this and all related perks almost 8 months ago, and then started selling repair kits.

They are NOT going to change anything. They're going to completely ignore your post, and hope that you just spend money on repair kits.

Nah I think you got exactly what you earned

I don't seem to have the problem as badly as I used to, but the process is still fundamentally broken.  If someone tries to friend you, and you know who they are, manually entering their name in the search box will accept the request.  If you don't, you can check Recents for anyone with a dot next to their name.

we rewards are good its just to hard for you whats why you are spending so much

No prob. Make sure you mod it up for even more rads

haha nice!

As long as it makes you jittery, I'm on board.

How good is the handmade vs the lever action? (I've been looking for a bloodied version/ instigating with no luck for either handmade or lever)

Also thank you :)

They made armor break down faster, then nerfed all perks that reduced armor wear. Then they put Armor repair kits on the atomic shop.

They made food spoil insanely fast, then nerfed all perks that preserved food. Then they put working refrigerators on the atomic shop.

This kind of "create a problem, sell the solution" design model for an online game isn't just 'naughty' - its absolutely shitty.

i work 2nd shift but play after work in the early am EST, i look you up if you're on

I'm not sure, all I know is I couldn't spell out more than 4 words

Exactly. I just dropped a bomb so they are good. At least the alpha code is.

Ha. The only thing I got wrong was bothering to think you might be capable of more than name calling. Now I'm a child too. Add it to the collection.
---
Btw you're being really rude and shitty on the internet, which is pretty pathetic on a forum about a computer game we all play. When I said Bethesda bad? That wasn't about you and im not saying that because you think it's somehow hard to say. Not everything is about you but yeah whatever. Got any more names to call me?

Game sucks. Community has only no life losers
---
I‚Äôve worn L45 excavator in SBQ multiple times.
---
Also had it on a couple days ago when a 3\* L88, 2\* L80, and a plain L80 Triple teamed me at my camp.
---
Numbers may be low, but the PA is quite useful
---
Yes, I have all the other PA suits, but like OP, am overencumbered frequently-  at L161, have spent most of the last 115 levels in Excavator.
---
thank you, unfortunately it doesn't work for me.  good hunting out there though
---
Yes better performance. Vats actually works well, raids are more responsive, and load times are faster. Still experience fps drop when starting combat but its a lot less but thats more to poor coding where even gaming computers have a hard time maintaining FPS for this poorly coded mess.
---
So the Vault 111 Overseer thinking he was the first one to ever think of the idea, even though the cryogenic technology **existed pre-war**, means no one else anywhere could have thought of the same thing?
---
Yeah, no.  A character thinking they had an original &amp; unique idea and then finding out later that isn‚Äôt the truth isn‚Äôt broken lore. Hell, that‚Äôs happened in real life.
---
They wouldn't have been there for over 2 hours if they hadn't

Just an old piece of a quest that was so boring and time consuming that players as a whole decided to cheat and just post the answers every week online.

There is no good shotgun build, unfortunately.

don't chastise me for spreading "paranoia" but rumor has it that's how you steal from other players now.

Incorrect as support team isn't as bad as you say as that would imply they have a support team and its not an automated system doing all the work.

Tf did you read?ü§£
---
That's some level!
---
I‚Äôd like them to allow us to drop the BOS rocket turrets at our bases.
---
How is paying to respec - *something you can do by just leveling up* - better then paying for a private server?
---
Paying for F1st doesn‚Äôt allow you to build an elaborate camp anymore then anyone else. 
---
I have the exact same frustrating limitations you do. 
---
To be fair - Yeah I kinda over did it on the classist remark but seriously asking for core levelling mechanics to touched by BGS‚Äôs already very aggressive monetization overlords is a dangerous game imho. 
---
**Why would they stop with just a paid respec option?**
---
*Once the door is open with this company - it‚Äôs open for good - as we‚Äôve seen so far.*
---
**The last thing we need right now or in the new future is any sort of paid / premium perks or remotely paid levelling mechanics.**
---
Let them work out the legendary perk cards before we start asking for them to be worth $.
---
Damage numbers already take into account her DR and her 70% damage reduction. Also, after you are capable of certain amount of damage (around 6,500 IIRC), the DR is completely ignored. So if you hit for 10k it doesn't matter if the enemy has 50 DR or 500 DR.
---
That said I'm skeptical that the damage numbers shown on the screen are the actual damage that she takes. Particularly she seems to not take full crit damage. I've hit her for 10k and it takes down 1/10 of her health bar. I've also hit her for 30k and it takes down 1/10 of her health bar. No rhyme or reason. I suspect that lag plays a factor. 
---
Agree with everything else. SBQ is a team sport and it's really fun to farm with a group.
---
‚Ä¢ Weapon balancing is pretty bad and I agree, there is no reason for a player to use a rifle is the same amount of damage can be done with an smg or lmg. People one shot things.
---
‚Ä¢Could you elaborate on the repair system part?
---
‚Ä¢Yeah teleporting enemies have happened a couple of times but not too often to where I would be upset.
---
‚Ä¢ Random hostilities? Thats strange, did you ever happen to damage one by accident? But of course it could always be a bug.
---
‚Ä¢ On PS4 so I don‚Äôt really run into glitch abusers but at the same time I wouldn‚Äôt know.
---
‚Ä¢ Pay to win aspects are eh, as your not really winning anything plus they don‚Äôt add to damage or affect your character. Other than the fridge and collection they are more so quality of life improvements. The repair kits and other stuff really don‚Äôt matter if you have the right perks, plus you can get better versions if you help kill the Scorch Beast Queen. FO1st is a quality of life improver as you only really save caps with your CAMP. The only thing that is sorta pay to win would be private servers as you get all the benefits of having the world all to yourself.
---
‚Ä¢ Yeah the initial launch was awful.
---
‚Ä¢ I wouldn‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt have FO1st
---
‚Ä¢ Yes
---
‚Ä¢ The story is weird I agree. There is one it‚Äôs just not on par with 3, NV, or 4. There is a story but it involves having to search for holotapes and reading a crap ton of terminals to understand each faction and what happened.
---
Also make sure your intelligence is the highest you can get it through SPECIAL, chems, armors when scrapping them, it'll increase your chance of mod unlock
---
Really curious what SIL means in this context. I've only ever heard it as sister-in-law or son-in-law, but I can't figure out how you'd have a male or 11 year old version of those.
---
Rad suit grants radiation immunity
---
Ghouls do at Max 100 damage per hit in a nuke zone, so 100 DR gives 50% protection and 1000 DR gives 78% protection. (My 250 DR grants 64%)
---
The perks you've mentioned give 45% and 20% respectively 
---
Factoring in perks and based on 100 DR a whitespring ghoul should only be doing about 5 damage or so, less with chems included.
---
The difference between a rad suit and a full X01 is only about 2 damage per hit at best with the perks you've mentioned (at 15 STR and 5 END you can get 110 DR just from perks, extra with scaly skin mutation)
---
Unless I've made a massive resistance miscalculation I can't see a reason to use bulky power armour, other than the carry weight and fun factor. 
---
Then again this is just the heavy vs light armour argument all over again..
---
Would give me something new to do in the game. I like it in principle, but would probably get bored.
---
They are slightly different beasts.  LA has high per shot damage while the handmade has much better dps due to firerate.  I prefer the handmade myself.  I started out a semi auto rifleman with a mix of LA and handmade, eventually switched to bloody commando with Handmades and a Fixer.
---
Calm down.
---
Not much help for you but yeah. 
---
They do disappear.
---
This math doesn't seem correct. By my math you need to earn like 27k XP?
---
Sure it works.
---
I give stuff away all the time im assuming u were a low level they attract high level people looking to troll
---
the extractor gives ore for whatever type of deposit You place it on - coal, iron, acid, etc.
---
The exception is for junk pile. Those give misc items that when looted in the wild, are considered  junk.
---
If you loot a mineral deposit (or node) without placing an extractor, you wil get ore, which combined with acid at a chem station, smelts to the appropriate scrap material.
---
Might be worth you giving fallout 4 a try also
---
Which silo is that?
---
I have the same 3 entry level turrets in my camp that I built at the start and nothing more. Grant it I don‚Äôt live in a very threatening place, but it just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. They‚Äôre bugged or broken half the time anyway
---
Agreed it is a slippery slope.  So what is the FO1st benefit.  I saw just some monthly  atoms an unlimited junk to craft. Not something I  would spend on. Just looking for something that I would that may not be P2W.
---
If they chase after you and they're low lvl run them towards one of the packs of ghouls at the golf club or the bungalows.
---
I had to move my camp into the low level side of the map just so my missiles would actually kill things, I'd be ok with it but the level 3 scorched still snipe with pipe revolvers from the next state over
---
Excavator only affects how much material you get when looting open veins and deposits.
---
If there is an extractor in place, excavator makes no difference in the yield.

---
1* 2-3k though I did snag one for 1.5 once.  They just don't turn up in vendors all that often for me.  For now use the best weapons you find and just keep looking it is a grind.
---
Just clicked on a thread asking if Bethesda fixed the hack.
---
Yes they did it.
---
Another commented if the things stolen were returned. 
---
"No" another one replied
---
The codes are good to go. The date is wrong.
---
Basically you either have to use repair kits or a large volume of material to fix a gun, which is fair, but you can't break a gun for spare parts like in NV. Jury rigger was my go to perk but this game doesn't even come close. I also feel that it would be better if guns started to jam or act up like in NV as a warning that they were close to breaking
---
Yeah the WS bots are sometimes just hostile, it happened to a friend the first time they entered. Not sure why but definitely didn't attack them.
---
Found a fair few material dupers in my time and even one bobblehead duper that nearly killed me while I wasn't in combat but that was a while ago.
---
It'll take a little bit to switch to commando, since I'll need to get the perk cards but I'll keep checking vendors just in case :)
---
Thanks alot
---
Sound for reloading a gatling gun while in power armor in 3rd person is still missing since launch...
---
Easier planting and a way to display PA without camp budget are the only things I want from the building aspect. My camps look awful, and I‚Äôm fine with that. However since gardening would be one of the few things we‚Äôd reasonably be able to organize, that would be great.
---
Thanks a lot
---
It's a massive time saver when you have all 4 machines going at max capacity.
---
You said you are bad at aiming guns. Did anyone show you, or did you figure out on your own, how to use VATS? It aims at the enemies for you, so you don't have to worry about your bad aim.
---
Haha...I really don‚Äôt know what I was thinking.  He‚Äôs just my stepson.  Maybe I was tired from my Santa Duties the night prior üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è!
---
It would definitely be nice to see the defenses and/or AI get some attention. I'd like to see a "lure" type item (like a scorchbeast lure without the dogwhistling) to get the baddies to a certain spot for the attention they crave.
---
In the meantime, I tend to place CAMP in locations with clear LOS to spawns, put lots of light around my CAMP (doesn't have to be spotlight) and prefer locations with low-level mobs. Another option is to drop your CAMP below LOS using terrain, or minimize avenues of approach. Yet another option is to build in existing structures (personal favorite.)
---
I've also had success putting decorations/junk around useful items to delay mobs.
---
Additionally, it can help to pay attention to what the mobs focus on (it's often the same items, for me. YMMV.)  So, if for some reason every mob wants to kill my Moo-moo, I ensure my turrets are positioned to focus them down while they're busy, or leave a scarecrow or something as bait and create a killzone. 
---
Again, not challenging OP's statement that the AI could use some love; merely a "here are some things I've done in the meantime" to help players who may be struggling.
---
Thanks! I just drop a nuke and it works
---
It‚Äôs a good thing you have about 3:15 before scorched earth starts, since it takes that long to change the perks for it.
---
Don't worry as you level up, you will be stronger and more familiar ... there are some hostile parts of the map, you in the pretty part of the map, stay in the middle of the map for now, venturing east or north will become harder, but all in good time. I would suggest doing melee and grabbing a good pickaxe or fireaxe and running. Hooking up with someone depending on your platform to show you the ropes.
---
So yes it feels like you useless but you have to remember you a low level, grab an empty PA frame, it will increase your strength. I will send you a video I made for new players to get you started and talk about the basics.
---
What platform/level are you on? If you're on CB1 I'll make ya some level-specific armor and wapons to help ya out
---
Let me clarify for you:
---
*(This is explicit not a sales pitch just a clear list of what it is)*
---
-	monthly atoms - 1450? (Effectively what the atom/costume bundles were before)
---
-	private servers for you and 8 friends atm. *(Modding &amp; persistence to come which is what I want (am a f4 modder)*
---
-	the survival tent - allows a secondary ‚Äúfast travel point‚Äù and access to your stash when you place it - neat 100% convenience I can live without 
---
-	the ‚Äúinfamous‚Äù scrapbox. - allows for unlimited *storage* of materials outside of your stash. It does not give you any materials. Definitely releases pressure on your stash. You can pay for one month fill it up and then just drain it until you want to sub again. 
---
If your looking to level your mule or move items in bulk - can‚Äôt help but feel the private server might be a decent choice for a little bit.
---
I  feel like you have confused me with the OP, I haven't mentioned any perks.
---
:D for most(or maybe just many) of us, the giving itself is a 'gift' - Plenty of people get a rush of feel-good just when someone accepts a gift we gave. It means much more than a thank you (or a return gift, or money, or any other kind of compensation) just to know the given item(s) were needed and used and appreciated.
---
Also, try melee. Go full out on end/str and smash things for a while (can always swap stuff around @ lv 50+ to try guns again later) - you will not have to worry so much about aiming, and with that much end, you won't be in much danger (also stuff obediently comes right up to you so you can turn them into hamburger)
---
Enjoy the game, fallout is a type of genre in of its own(like sims is a genre of its own) - I play both, and love both, but they are defiantly very different things with little crossover.
---
Also welcome to the game, hope you enjoy your time here.
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah, all gone. Get calibrated shocks, unless you already have them...in which case start walking lol
---
if they are updated anywhere they will be posted on there first
---
The programming is just poor. 
---
Good thing the AI programming is so much worse your camp rarely gets destroyed.
---
Yeah I get it know. I also wish the repair system was better, I even at one point suggested the exact same thing that you said. So yeah I agree, it‚Äôs not very good.
---
There is no hurry, I didn't until level 100 when I hade  dozens of unused level ups.  SemiAuto is completely viable.
---
Lightwood laminate, lightwood laminate, lightwood laminate!
---
I may try it fora bit at some point, thanks.
---
Def! Luckily mine are modded up, and I (weirdly) have 3 different varieties of bloodied Gamma guns on hand. I actually need to unload a couple, ha.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a single santa scorched since morning. are they gone already too? üòµ
---
Fuck the bag yeah he‚Äôs right Fuck the bag!
---
You must be new here.
---
Was wondering the same thing. Also haven't seen any holiday scorched all morning either.
---
You wouldn't last 5 minutes in the Mojave 
---
I'll be honest 4 and 76 are an easy start to the fallout series, personally I prefer New Vegas but that can be... Harsh to a new player. Most people are quite nice and you can find a fair few guides on the internet, food is easy in this game since rice and dirty water can be cooked into a decent food (south east along the river has plenty)
---
They're still out there, I'm playing now and just had one spawn for me.  Just getting started, so can't tell if they rate is the same.
---
That hack was able to be done at a range, so closeness wouldn‚Äôt matter.
---
But, every day new shit comes out so I‚Äôd stat away regardless.
---
IDK, just wonder towards some hungry ghouls and they should back off sharpish
---
The part that really made me wanna punch the person in charge at Bethesda was the whole, ‚Äúwe have reports people MIGHT have been affected.‚Äù Then went on to confirm they did, but don‚Äôt worry, 500+ people is a very minor amount
---
Thanks I need to look harder then!
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, was there not a way to fix this problem? Because if there was then it's fine and it's not a game breaking bug
---
Santatron is not liked by my lasers either. Dude can't catch a break.
---
Thought i read in itv it ended 26, but the nw event goes past new years.
---
assuming the rumor is true, now it's based on the interface and requires a trade window to be open.
---
Take your time. Explore every nook and cranny.  Don't worry about in the main storyline.  Most importantly have fun!
---
Go complete a scorched earth event if you have no caps. 
---
I personally wouldn't sell them for less then daily cap limit. 
---
[https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Event:\_Scorched\_Earth](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Event:_Scorched_Earth)
---
CAMP Budgeting is way off. Two razor grain to a wall. And my turrets still attack each other. (Xbox)
---
Thank you for the advice
---
If it took 2 hours on Novice, he‚Äôs not getting anywhere with Regular, and especially not Expert
---
Thx for that :)
---
True... but you need to start some wear. With a little practice and more teammates, he will get there
---
The lead extractor doesn't give ore for lead it gives scrap lead
---
Lmao this is the edgiest comment I‚Äôve seen all day
---
Hmm I personally wouldn't want to mess with a bloodied one, might be too unpredictable. Good luck!
---
this question has been asked 5 times today, im sure you could have found them by a simple search
---
Ah right, blocker and lone wanderer, I was basing it on that. With those perks PA levels of DR aren't needed, enabling free movement and punching weapons
---
Had 3 pop up around Drop site 9 a short while ago so they are still out there
---
Well, I checked just now and the gift wrap is still there for me, and I killed a holiday Scorched at Camden Park not too long ago.
---
I've been looking for one as well, but before you make the decision to do it look at the components it takes to craft it. If you don't mind chasing those items down every time it gets broke, the no big deal
---
Not to be the stick in the mud but honestly has it done any good yet? Even the guy who did the PC hacks (or at least some of them) posted evidence of it on YouTube but he was still playing not 10 hours ago
---
To bad its gonna be monitized. If not they will sell the large plots and then give the smaller one for free. And then its gonna take up alot of camp space.
---
Other sub
---
Well if I kill myself then I‚Äôll know, ha. Could be useful in case my health ends up super high though. I‚Äôll test it and see üëç
---
Can you provide the platform details?  Location and grid size?  I have tried this,  and she won't land on the one I built. I can solo her in less than 30 seconds when she lands, but getting her to land is the killer. If this platform is the key,  then I would like to know more about it.
---
It was patched, but apparently there is another one where people can buy anything for 1 cap. I got hit by that one.
---
This game isn‚Äôt on steam...
---
I might have to buy a handful then
---
Had mine since August and I've never had to repair it but then my camp is in the forest.
---
I'll ask the same. Can you provide more detail about the platform?  Location,  grid size,  height,  construction. I too can solo her in 20 seconds,  but getting her to land is the challenge. I too have run thousands of queens and never seen a platform used.
---
Not to my knowledge there isnt, it would need to be fixed before they try outting them in FO76, remember the issues caused when the kever action rifle bug came to FO76 from FO4
---
I love your "New-Vault-Dweller" story!   You're wonderful, and I hope you stay with us!
---
Something that might help is that there is a Voice Chat system, you can check it under Settings---&gt;Audio.  The default might be Auto, and if you want to take part just hook up a mic or wear a headset (even the cheap $15 Logitechs work decently well).  A lot of people just set for Area as well, but Auto should switch back and forth between Area talk and Team talk.  
---
I really do hope you continue to explore, learn, and thrive here in the Wasteland with us!  Good luck!
---
Stop playing the victim and looking for pity you fuckin idiot
---
Some people love this game, others hate it and havent even played it. I'd suggest playing it for an hour or 2 and you decide. I tried it again but it's not for me but I did get my money's worth
---
They added a passive mode at some point preventing this from happening, and if your camp has a vending machine other players can't harm it directly.
---
If trolling is your concern you might want to play again
---
I‚Äôm gonna be the downvoted guy in this thread for sure, but I honestly hope they retcon this game out of existence. They pulled so many strings and rewrote so much lore to create a story that‚Äôs ‚Äúmeh‚Äù at best and awful at worst. Ultracite feels like a lazy write in and the Scorchbeasts were the most unimaginative enemies, being literal copy-pasted Skyrim dragons (this isn‚Äôt an opinion, the code in game is literal copy-pasted the same code for dragons in Skyrim, yet somehow even buggier)
---
What vendor
---
No paper for me either and I've checked 6 vendors.
---
In my server, there is no wrapping paper and the Santa‚Äôs are gone. Looks like it ended around 9am pst.
---
Nope. You signed a waiver when signing their TOS.
---
Here are some early game tips tho I've been trotting out for over a year:
---
1. Use throwing knives! They are simple to craft (you just need steel scrap and a weapons bench) and they hit like a truck at lower levels, much harder than the ranged weapons you'll likely have. I carried them religiously until my chars were in their level 20s.
---
2. Consider leveling up endurance early, and leveling the Lead Belly perk. You don't have access to a lot of the really baller perks until you're higher level so you don't have to worry much about "wasting" perks or special points early on. Lead Belly at max means you take no radiation from food and drink. It's not that managing rads is particularly difficult, even early on. But the diseases Rad X and Radaway leave you susceptible to CAN be hard to manage. Just one less thing to worry about hopefully.
---
3. Do the responder quests early. Great source of XP and supplies, and some of the weapons and gear you get are very useful early on. Somerset Special for example punches way above its weight class due to its armor piercing effect, and Silver lining is a good chest piece that buffs your endurance. The anti-scorch training pistol is also very handy early on, but if you can hack it (some of the combat is kinda difficult, at least it was for me on my first playthrough) try to complete the Cold Case quest in Toxic Valley (talk to the robo nanny at Wavy Williard's.) It's the water park marked by a big alligator on your map). Doing so unlocks perfect storm, a 10 mm SMG that is a horrendous ammo pig but does a considerable amount of fire damage on top of high damage per second. 
---
4. Remember to scrap all your junk at a workbench before storing, and don't pick up heavy ammo like missiles or mini-nukes unless you are for sure going to use them. That stuff takes up a lot of inventory and stash space. 
---
Good luck! I hope you continue to enjoy the game
---
It initially ended the 26th but they extended it to the 31st.
---
No gift wrap at any vendors for me either.
---
R&amp;G Station.
---
"a few players losing items "
---
LMAO
---
Definitely. Love my lever action, but it doesn't last.
---
My camp is at a pond with mirelurks in them when I spawn, the missile turrets do an amazing job for me personally
---
In addition... I always thought it was dumb that turrets apparently need spotlights, but you don't get a spotlight plan right away.
---
You'll get used to it. :) I prefer as my first perk to go Luck, and get Pharma Farma. Hit the spacebar when you loot those chem bags/first aid/mirrors. PF will give you a chance to hit those extra chems that could save your life. Scrounger is ok if your going guns. My main is melee so I don't have it equipped but if your new/going gun it might help out. If you get way too many chems, vendor them or sell them to a bot. With PF you will get more. \*Over 200 stims, I have to vendor all the time. If you don't have a group. Lone Wanderer Perk is good. Always remember the circle at Vault tec for any new toons or alts. You walk out the door, GO RIGHT! There is a body besides the vault. Free gun and ammo. Go down, kill the liberators, loot and search everything, continue down, kill more liberators and loot. Look along the wall by the military trucks. Ammo. Check the pipes under the street. Body with ammo. Chem box. Start to head rightish down. There is a campsite that might contain libs, or scorched, or ghouls. But more ammo, two guns on the ground and food. From there go left to the Moonshiners Shack, kill loot, if you go up some from there, there is two dead bodies and some ammo. After your done looting the shack, go up back to the vault and then head out to the left, follow the other road, loot another body and follow the road.
---
Unless this is something where it's going to vanish the next time I relog, which wouldn't surprise me.
---
I had same issue myself turret went insane attack Graham and then he went in rampage and destroying my base till I was able to store the turret. Since that day I refuse to use turrets I‚Äôll let the wild life attack my base least it keeps everyone safe.
---
 I put my CAMPs in nice places. Even my mire CAMP only gets attacked once in a while by Scorched. My low level turrets and some walls work fine.
---
 If you want to be where you need heavy defences, that's up to you.
---
Well did not see any others so I‚Äôm sorry for the inconvenience
---
Just enjoy the game. You shouldn‚Äôt let others influence your opinion of it. Bethesda dropped the ball with 76 and people are forever going to talk shit about it. Whining on Reddit about evil YouTubers isn‚Äôt changing that.
---
Yeh that‚Äôs what I plan on doing
---
Thank you for this. I thought I was going crazy looking for it. Very annoying.
---
K cool thanks
---
Bandolier and KEEP ALL AMMO
---
All they have to do is change it so mobs don't attack objects and so many problems would go away. 
---
If I am in my camp, OK, come at me. *Me.*
---
If my camp is empty... why the hell is a dog trying to destroy a bookcase? 
---
If mobs are going to attack objects at least have it make some sense. Maybe some mobs want to raid some kinds of plants. Maybe ghouls want the sweet radiation in your fusion generator. Now you have to think about your camp layout and goals more. They could, like, make it into a *game.* Instead it is meaningless chaos.
---
That‚Äôs weird in PS4 got gifts today and wrapping was available.. have you tried server hopping ?
---
Whaaaat? I really thought all of it would be available until the 31st. :/
---
Way better on lag. Spawn rates are better (not timing out, I'm guessing). You still get occasional stutter, but 150% better than public.
---
Just ran 5 sites ( including big bend with a muzzleloader, it's a must tryl) and no joy.  O well it was a great event no complaints by me.
---
I‚Äôm confused
---
I've tweeted about this alot also. It would be cool if they added in planter boxes with plants in then already so the whole thing would count as 1 item instead each plant counted as different items.
---
I would trade the entire idea of building my own camp where I want it if I could travel to some kind of pre-made, instanced camp... a special location like Vault 76... just give me all the damn workbenches and a purified water source and a bed and leave me alone while I am in there.
---
Ahh man that sucks. Bethesda giveth and taketh away
---
Incredible. So that's been a bug for over a year now?
---
No I have gone back within 5-10 minutes and all workshops persist.
---
She's a giant bat.  Bats don't really have long tails.
---
Yes, my private server is  more stable than Adventure mode. 
---
For all things. 
---
Faster load times, faster loot times, faster response rate, faster everything.
---
Agreed on the raid part. We used to fail the one where you have to vote with cards almost every time we ran expert, sometimes standard. The cards took up to 5 seconds to swipe, 30+ seconds for a door to open, its like everything in the vault slowed down except the timer. -.-
---
The scorchbeasts/queen are heavily mutated bats! And bats don't have tails (to my knowledge) :D
---
I think she's a bat mutation,  so i don't think she had a tail.   There are no silly questions.
---
I dont think I have ever thought about it, weirdly tho thats where I shoot her a lot. I gonna say its her ass and there is no tail but I could be wrong.
---
P.S. tell him to get you a PS4
---
Do you have the flux to craft it? I haven't built one in a while, but IIRC it takes something like 20 pieces of flux in various colors. The plan won't do you much good if you can't assemble it.
---
Remove turrets 
---
Install punji sticks
---
???
---
Profit
---
I just popped into WS, and they were all available for purchase.  Server hop a bit, maybe someone bought them before you got there.
---
All the inputs from the clients (game running on the player's device ie not trusted) must be validated and resolved on the server (running at Bethesda ie trusted).
---
Here the state of the game (the inventory of players) can be directly updated by the players, which should NEVER be the case.
---
What you do normally is expose a minimal interface (here for instance a "rob attempt" command) which is accepted or rejected by the server (with a cooldown of course).
---
Try checking another vendor and see if they‚Äôre there
---
Yeah minecraft PC has sweeping edge enchantment or something. That would be awesome in this game.
---
I took mine down all I had was regular machine gun turrents and they kept shooting at each other and my junk collectors they were helping at all and I live in point pleasant so the enemies are easy low levels got more extra build space now
---
I just checked on 2 different servers. Unless someone cleaned out both of them, including all the low quality wrap, they're gone from the game.
---
They tweeted that they have extended the Santa scorched until the 31st but there‚Äôs mixed reports where some people are still able to buy wrapping paper and some aren‚Äôt.
---
The event was supposed to end on the 31st. But once again Bethesda eff up
---
They do but they‚Äôre very short
---
I am not sure it is 1.5k threshold. A few months back, my first couple SBQ fights I did there was absolutely no way I was doing that much damage. I was using a nonlegendary minigun without my perks set right into a build. I was plinking off 1 dmage per round. She was 3/4 of the way dead too. I went thru about 1k rounds and probably about 60 percent of them hit her.
---
I still got to loot her and still got to complete the scortched earth even. I ended up getting a pretty badass explosive shotgun, and two bits of 3* marine armor. Maybe it had to do with the amount of hits you make?
---
I killed one 2 minutes ago ..
---
But then why can we use all other atom shop items in workshops?
---
Bats don‚Äôt have very long tails at all so she may not have one at all and if she does it‚Äôs going to be small
---
They just forgot to extend the event timer
---
I was buying them this morning &amp; killing Santa Scorched....but after the daily challenges renewed I stopped seeing them. Then went to a private world &amp; went to all the scorched locations...Zero Santa's....
---
According to the patch notes the holiday gifts went through 12pm est on the 26th.
---
Advice?  Just starting shooting and griefing others.  Good things will happen I swear!!
---
I have reported some players with video proofs and haven't seen them since. So perhaps it does any good.
---
If you are afraid it'll break or get broken,  put it in a protected room or store it until you can.   I usually have mine in an upper level in my camp.   Also,  be sure to use the contractor perk card to reduce the flux it takes to build it...
---
Wrong choise of a first game, but if you are here you might as well enjoybas much as you can. What platform are you on?
---
According to the website it‚Äôs the 31st.
---
Yep... a thousand things they needed to fix and the one glitch that helps us gets patched...
---
Lol thanks too everyone.... wheew I was  feeling crazy lol....  And I love this game wish I was better at controlling it...
---
I now think that turrets or any kind of defensive camp structures actually attracts more hostile mobs to your camp. 
---
I got rid of my turrets a few weeks back after they went haywire and since then my camp very rarely gets attacked by anything.
---
Don't switch worlds or go to a private world. As long as your in the world you're in you're good....at least that's how it was for me. Second I jumped servers all the Santa's we gone.
---
Lately my turrets have been attacking each other.
---
Don't worry, I also was totally a virgin to this kind of games, especially in multiplayers. I got panic from the first other player I encountered and I tried to kill it with an improvised weapon, a shovel or something. This player was high level and didn't get what I was doing because it didn't make any sense :-D It was before the pacifist mode was on per default and I actually killed the other player with my shovel! With the time I got accustomed to these new things and I still play a lot and have a lot of fun. So have fun yourself in this cool world!
---
We have one for my boys..... noone shares lol......
---
Honey beasts (big fuck off bees that can spawn in whitespring and a few places) seem to be a good source, as well as random legendary drops of course
---
You can purchase blueprints as well
---
I can make combat armour for you, pro as marine too
---
ok. i see.
---
It looks like a mashup of armors with the scout head, but not anything new.
---
Yup, my Santatron no longer gives gifts. Bethesda forgot to extend the event &lt;facepalm&gt;
---
yes but it is the mod, i am not looking for- not the gun...but the mods for it, they should spawn in world- just q to find out where :-)
---
Figures.  Looks like it is done.  Everyone is gone for the holidays. Maybe they'll reintroduce them in 2020, like when they made up for ending NW Halloween awards early.
---
Nope.  You wrote; "The company is at fault for providing a game that is too easy to circumvent but they ultimately are not the ones choosing to do an asshole thing."
---
The "asshole thing" was releasing a game to the public they knew were full of security flaws.  Again, ultimately, the company bares the responsibility.
---
5.56 is the best alternate currency.
---
Acid/Lead is better crafted into 5.56 for trading purposes. 
---
Rarely will you find someone who wants bulk lead or acid, as most of us keep these stockpiled.
---
I swear ive seen that name somewhere, think i was at your camp, gt: AirTurtle88691
---
*You put it in your ass and carry it around for five years.*
---
Yep.  Shocked!
---
Caps 5.56 Stealthboys in that order.
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Yes, I paid for the monthly subscription (because let's face it. Am I really going to be playing this game still in a year?) 
---
They took the money out of my account this morning. So I logged in, only to find no Atoms, No Holiday Scorched, no giftwrap.
---
Because it is not a PVP game
---
Sorry to hear about that but if you drop an item (do a bullet or something) after doing something, it will force a save.
---
Well it was
---
I don't think I've ever seen enclave specific mods. Can't you use regular plasma gun mods?
---
True for the wrapping paper, but I still get gifts from my santatron and still get to kill santa scorched
---
It tends to be item specific when the atom shop lockout breaks. 
---
I imagine there‚Äôs a currently unavoidable way for players to blueprint wallpapers and replace them and that‚Äôs why the outright locked it out. 
---
I imagine with Wastelanders or whatever the upstream version is this will get fixed but for now it screams dev protection workaround
---
Because buy atom store stuff pls
---
Mistyharmony385 
---
I am usually on during the weekend in the morning, CST US, lvl 54, sniper.  Love exploring and building.  Currently camped near Blackbear Loadge.
---
Level up go to the gold club a shoot through the window. Lvl 50 is when the game starts. I followed high levels around shooting at their enemies. I got to level 50 in 2 days during double xp
---
I forgot about that, I‚Äôd prefer if the next single player Fallout had real time VATS.
---
Jesus, this sub triggers quick.
---
Very much so.
---
The bad press is just that, bad press and is usually super exagerated. 
---
The game has some issues, but all Bethesda games do.  It's still alot of fun. 
---
Most people will go weeks or months without even experiencing the "bugs" that most youtubers complain about.
---
3 characters, 3 CAMPS, Zero turrets....they do not do anything and take up budget
---
Thanks.  No, I'm not worried about trolling. There's an a-hole in every game.  I just took a break that lasted longer than anticipated, and now I'm wondering with all I've missed (and being low level)  is it still fun for people who aren't high level and loaded with legendary loot and coin?  
---
I was in Destiny 2 for some time then had to break for surgery.  By the time I got back into it I struggled to find anyone to join because everyone had so far surpassed where I was in the game.  Hoping this isn't the same.
---
I know was wondering if anyone else got it? Apparently it‚Äôs was a creator
---
Thank you.
---
Didn't know that, thanks for the tip! :)
---
You can get/find plans to make Marine and Combat Armor. Any legendary variant will come from a drop, player vending, or the Purveyor.
---
They used to randomly spawn in world, sadly not anymore...
---
I might have seen you drop this base at a SBQ fight, I remember seeing a player do it a few months ago, (this was before FO1st and everyone sitting on top of their tents), it was pretty much a multi-level platform and everyone loved it- if it was or wasn't you, still a great idea, thanks for helping others!
---
Just asking...Never played any other FO games before 76...I would assume that they were not PVP as they were single player games&gt;  Is that correct?  If so, why would you think that FO76 would be a PVP game?  This is a serious question...If no other FO games were PVP then why would you expect this one to be?
---
I saw wrapping paper and a Santa scorched like 20 minutes ago
---
Until Bethesda gets a new Engine, they dont HAVE a future in gaming.
---
It‚Äôs been modified since launch.
---
Other players could still do slap damage and damage your camp. 
---
Now pacifist mode gives you 100% protection from other players.
---
I would hope it would function like our c.a.m.p. does now. We log off and it's gone with us, as soon as we go back in it materializes. 
---
Workshops could do the same thing.
---
nooo. I wasn't able to play yesterday, and I have 12k caps burning a hole in pocket
---
The vendors only have 1 of each paper, when someone buys them, they're gone until the vendors reset.  That's the way they work.
---
I've been on 4 servers, all had paper.  I just bought 10, and I'm hopping to get more now.  I haven't seen a server without the papers yet.
---
Because you would assume from the Fallout universe that there would be conflict among humans in West Virginia.
---
Yes other fallout games didn‚Äôt have PvP but they did have People VS People. 
---
This is the first game that is multiplayer, with the only fallout game having other players in it, clearly they want us to align with factions, it would only make sense to have PvP elements in the game. Survival servers I thought preformed pretty well and satisfied a lot of people.
---
Not to mention the assassins prefix for legendary gear, but that‚Äôs almost too literal.
---
I just bought 10, and saw them on other servers.  I'm hopping now to burn some caps, they aren't gone yet.
---
Tested this out, went to NW to finish the daily challenge, returned to adventure and the second scorch spawn had holiday scorched among them, 2 in fact.
---
An inside the vault last week said that the Christmas event will be extended until December 31. I havent checked yet on xbox though.
---
I have seen a mod, so they do exists
---
You can also build the wreath from NW at friends camps, but not the gifts or tree.
---
Very much so, I‚Äôve been playing since beta and I love this game. Wastelanders will be releasing around February so now is a great time to play through the main story and get a good feel for it. Build up a solid character and get ready for then.
---
100% agree with yah bud. Now we just need to wait 6 months for Bethesda to respond.
---
You dont need defences if you build on top of the mountain &lt;insert overused meme&gt;
---
Gotcha. I know the mod plans don‚Äôt exist but I didn‚Äôt realize they were out in the wild.
---
Yup. That too.
---
When I started playing there _weren't_ spawns in that zone at all.
---
Is this the SS No Budget?  I took a few screenies when I saw that camp a couple weeks ago.
---
Novice rewards need to be better. Been asking for months. I think all they did was increase the stims rewarded at the end.
---
And even then the rewards aren't great.
---
Along with the handy links here, I also suggest this video playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7pGJQV-jlzD17YNNbt103xp0PkkUCoPU](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7pGJQV-jlzD17YNNbt103xp0PkkUCoPU)   
---
Not too long ago I had the same question as you after having only played FO4, and really wanted to dig into the lore. He does it in a fantastic immersive way imo, and has a really smooth voice.
---
No kidding.  I just posted a few places that I'm still seeing scorched and wraps, guy told me to stop server hopping...  ?!?
---
Got 15 large wraps just now, and have killed a few santa scorched.  Haven't seen presents in the gift-o-tron yet, but haven't been online all that much.
---
Not sure what's going on then. A lot of people are reporting it. I've been to 3 servers and went to a lot of the locations....not getting anything.
---
Weird I seen a few Holiday Scorched this morning. I didn't see wrapping paper mind you.
---
I got a phoone for freeee flalala lalala us cellular
---
How‚Äôs the pvp?
---
Oh, sounds like a plan. I run out of stims incredibly fast. A cowboy dude gave me 40 packs and it's gone! I'll definitely go and try my luck with the luck perks. Xx
---
This does not actually work and was removed from the game a few patches ago. Even before it was removed it didn't actually do anything.
---
Dude grow up. They are semi rare cosmetics from an event which didn‚Äôt work properly so yes there‚Äôs gonna be new masks just those we saw last year and didn‚Äôt obtain. Also when it comes to seasonal events I don‚Äôt mind it being the same as last year because we don‚Äôt see it often.
---
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be able to kill people in the game once wastelanders comes out. That said, it would be nice if they offered a mode that allowed all pvp (besides nuclear winter). That way those who want it could go there.
---
No, they're instanced for each player. IF there was only 1 per vendor there's no way you would have ever seen them available at high traffic spots like the WS train station, but I was able to buy one or two every time I landed on a new server.
---
well at least your turrets didn't attack each other
---
r/entitledredditors
---
Thanks friend. Appreciate it.
---
Beckley itself is bugged in the challenges and has been reported as a bug already
---
https://i.imgur.com/7oCgpLI.png
---
Just hopped servers to get these, every vendor in WS had them (the faction ones).  Took the screen shot at 2 eastern just after finishing.
---
Don‚Äôt like it? don‚Äôt use it. Simple af
---
Congrats on giving Bethesda more money because of their poor programing.
---
Thanks....And great answer....If there is such a large community for this then why don't people start up small groups and initiate it?  I see messages and posts about it but it seems like no one ever shows up for it.  Or maybe it is just a small percentage that want PVP?  I am not sure...never did survival or NW so I am not sure if I am good at it or not....I played only Halo series until this game and was pretty good but not sure how it may translate...NW seems like it would be similar to Big Team Battle in Halo....
---
I've been playing since it came out. I've never once had any game breaking bugs or any poor experiences besides being griefed once. If you can find it on sale buy it.
---
Was it the inventory management ease that hooked you?
---
Imagine spending money on another persons forum post
---
I'm hoping this gets fixed soon. :( Because of real life family and personal emergencies and then the holidays, I missed the vast bulk of this event. Only got like, idk, 15 presents overall? I was hoping to go a little crazy with my play time over the next few days to make up for it.
---
Really?  I thought Santatron was awesome!
---
Yeah, first first-person game... I think I'm getting a bit better at controlling it. My first few hours made me a bit drunk... I'll be running and then suddenly be looking at the sky and then the ground and sorta behind me. I'm better now. Really. :)
---
Cooking it Fallout seems to be the only skill I'm good at. Haha
---
Don't know what to tell you.  I just bought 20 papers off 4 server hops, and was killing santa scorched earlier.  I haven't seen anything different excdept my tron hasn't coughed up any gifts yet out of about 6 items or so.  Still too early to tell there though.
---
For the love of gardening and all that is horticultural, please give us garden plots!
---
They should fix the infinitesimally small drop rate of the rare masks, but as far as everything else is concerned, I'd leave it.  Fasnacht stuff is highly versatile and looks fine no matter what the season.  Players who weren't around last March could only get the rewards from player vending, and they don't come up that often.  So, yes, they deserve a chance to get their own.
---
Sure man, been playing since beta and haven‚Äôt rly had much of a problem with glitches and bugs. People are generally nice or just ignore you in game and the drama seems very hyped up. Plus if you get the game on CD keys it‚Äôs super cheap
---
I've server hopped about 5 times, checked random vendors from WS to Sutton. Its gone.
---
I was watching someone fight the scotch queen and they were using a green blazer gun and it look hella powerful do you know what that is
---
That is how I imagine it would work.
---
No, if they make it online they will fuck it up, again. Not to mention that they would monetize it out of the arse too.
---
The DMV is in the same building as the courthouse now, they sort of rearranged the capital building a patch or two ago. Form can be found in a box next to a terminal down the hall from the DMV area.
---
Or melee swing speed
---
I would say buy it to play it.  It got a lot of hate because there were a lot of bugs at launch and it was not what so many were expecting it to be, but it really is a good game especially now that most of the major bugs are fixed.
---
What system?  Doesn't seem to have changed on PC.
---
No but after the event ppl who only got the free collectron can only collect junk with it, which needs emptying quite a bit and doesn't collect nearly as much. If you bought the collectron however you can choose either scrap or junk.
---
Ah, thank you. Xx
---
So that's what I heard the other night! There was a guy constantly saying "Anja, I see you!". Kinda freaked me out... Like how does Mutant know my name? So, just another player. Haha. I'll go buy a headset. Mwa
---
Unacceptable with a digital transaction. Take the money. Give the service. If I purchase Atoms it's immediate. If I purchase a 1st subscription fresh, it's immediate. Same thing with Xbox Gamepass. it's immediate. I probably wouldn't have noticed, or cared if they didn't fuck up the "extended event" or allow their community to have their inventories taken. It's just part of the snowball.
---
They actually do have a support team. The quickness of which something gets dealt with corresponds to how hard it is to deal with
---
Oh well, it's fun. PC.
---
If it is something you think you will rely on, invest points into the agility stat.  The agility perk Action boy/girl will make it refill more quickly, and just having points in agility will make it last longer.  Also the charisma perk lone wanderer will help it fill up faster and reduce the amount of damage you take.  Lone wanderer is a slightly different perk card than most others though where you need 2 points to equip the lowest level.
---
 Those 2 perks are a must have for quite a few builds.  Also make sure to play a musical instrument whenever you can and you get a bonus for one hour that makes your action points refill quicker.  Recommend building an instrument and a bed in your camp as soon as you can and always make sure you sleep and play an instrument before heading out.  Sleeping will give you extra xp points.
---
Gatling Laser most likely. 
---
It looks neat, but its one of the weaker  heavies.  
---
Pretty lights.  Lacks in damage output.
---
Nah the issue here isn't actually with Bethesda it's with digital River who they do all the money processing through.
---
Anything Bloodied. 
---
Junkies is also comming of age right now as a viable alternative (full health builds like this one)
---
You're right but you can only collect junk after the event with the santatron. Only ppl who bought the collectron can choose scrap or junk.
---
PS4. I wonder if they forgot to extend it on this platform
---
You might find yourself liking it non-ironically. If you can get it on sale, give it a whirl, lots of new content coming in Spring.
---
Before you pose yourself let me give you some tips on how to play fallout 76. If the game is launched, on Xbox, hit the middle button and return home. Click on fallout 76 from "games and apps" then press start. Your almost there. You should see an option to uninstall. Click that and let it do it's thing. Once uninstalled, send this comment to every single player in recent players. Then, just then you might only wait a few years for a real fallout game that works.
---
Haha, yeah... I think experienced players hang out around the vault just to check out what stupid things newbies do!
---
Killing with a shovel... Brutal. Xx
---
PC might be good but console doesn‚Äôt appear to be working
---
Yes I would rather fight the wendigo.
---
If someone gives you vintage nukashine- drink it right away. It‚Äôll give you the full fallout experience!
---
I don't think it should be removed, but I think that, like Berserker, the fact that it underperforms baseline numbers when the player goes against its requirements is stupid.
---
Yes, very true, especially with one of the DLC‚Äôs, you could begin the game with numerous solid weapons and other useful items.
---
You gotta go back in there for one of the raider quests
---
Lierally just came off after a couple of hours did the Glassed caverns and prime got 5 large 3 normal and 20 small just before I logged off my Santatron gave me 1 large and 2 small. on PC. hope this helps.
---
Lots of ppl role play for fun. I have an alt vampire who only hunts at night, so for him nocturnal is better.
---
For rose?
---
Eh, with some of the lighter/ 90rw versions a full health build might benefit from 1 weapon for situational use, but over all I agree.  At least remove the daytime penalty.
---
What platform? I still get gifts from Santa's placed in workshops like 10 minutes ago on PC?
---
dude why would you waste your money on the game when the real content is right here on the sub. I swear I decided not a shell a cent when this was announced as a multiplayer only title but dear me the amount of "content" the devs and the mostly this community has provided is just insane. Stick around here my friend things will get much much better people watching this dumpster fire grow bigger and bigger. I mean ever since the fallout 1st fiasco I knew that there was no limit to how low beth will stoop and so far my expectations have been spot on. Special thanks to the sub and the people who bought this game because we all know that none of this would have been possible without you guys
---
Add me, same ign as here. Ill probably be in game soo enough. Watch out for the cheaters tho. That is what i have to say, im having fun as well but it is bitter from time to time.
---
They're gone on XB. Wanted to spend the last of my NW earnings.
---
That would be SO surprising!  ^^/s
---
So just so I understand this - you had pacifist on - and it bypassed slap damage - and the max damage cap - and pvp caps - and about 4 other safe guards since I run a stealth sniper who can one shot a lvl 80ish death claw and yet somehow can't do what your saying in pvp - and you just got 1 shot 
---
welp either A he was cheating or B....
---
You forgot to mention just how bad the AI of all turrets are when it comes to how aware they are of the world around them. I live in the forest and my rocket turrets combined with a spotlight very often fail to even notice level 3 molerats ; let's not even get to enemies standing a mile downrange peppering your base.
---
Looks like it might be that, have to check around more.
---
Nope, should be removed, Beserker's actually serves a purpose and is much more useful in comparison on every level.
---
What system are you on? I have a theory (I actually just posted a thread) that it might be system related. I've been playing on xbox for several hours this morning, and haven't seen any holiday stuff since the daily challenge timer reset. Even on a private server there was no gift wrap, so it can't be chalked up to other players buying it.
---
PC checking in, no issues here.  Not sure about the tron, but the rest is working fine.  Wrap and santa scorched are still around.
---
Posted on that thread.  It's a definitely possibility.
---
I have 2 primary builds a combat engineer (who doubles as a medic) in power armor and a RP rifleman who is themed behind the whole scavenger vibe and it pretty much doesn't help me with anything and I use a lot of ammo
---
Well, the event needs a fix for the jerks who place power armor on the bot paths first.
---
Did nothing. Oh well, such is life.
---
Bulk scrap before putting it in your scrap box
---
PS4 central US time no Santa scorched or wrapping paper for the last couple of hours. Probably since 11 am here (2.5 hours ago)
---
Even if you don't have video proof report them every match so the data can be reviewed on the backend
---
They count as lights.
---
Yup
---
Mine still collects ok. Get 2-3 gifts at least every 20mins.
---
Fuckin trash fam
---
have some self respect man. Is this really what you payed for?
---
Honestly they just need to add harvestable potted plants and planters. Instead of just having dirt only varieties add some pre potted ones as well. It wouldn't be as nice as creating your own but it would work. Also would be a nice time to add versions of all the other harvestable items that you can't currently grow
---
Git gud, casul
---
Oh wait... Wrong game, sorry.
---
Well Im half way through the syringer quest üòÖ
---
That was part of it, it allows me to concentrate more on the lore. To explore the game seems fresh again. I'm a woman &amp; had dealt with griefers a lot. This feels so freeing. Everything seems less rushed &amp; calmer, more fun.
---
üòÜ good luck with that
---
Weird! I stopped producing gifts around noon eastern (2.5 hours ago) I wonder if only some servers are affected.
---
No matter which way you cut it from. It's dumb. It may be a 3rd party company. But it's still on Bethesda for using Digital River for processing. Especially because this is the only service I've noticed it on. If they were doing one thing right, I wouldn't have noticed. But again, it's the snowball with everything.
---
PC appears to be good I guess you guys have been through a lot lately so that‚Äôs good for a change lol
---
While items can be added they will not flag you for a ban. Anything like this is reviewed manually to make sure that the character in question actually is the culprit
---
Went on yesterday and one of my turrets was bugged and just shot at mu bases for ages
---
Bloodied Power attack meathook. This weapon Allows you to use unarmed cards and  one handed perk cards at the same time. Only really necessary against end game bosses like the SBQ or the alpha animals in project paradise but it smacks harder then anything in the entire game.
---
I got most of the commons. Would like to try to get some uncommon again. I think a plan for temporary uncommon masks would be cool though. Could use the decay mechanics from food on the mask in theory.
---
It is currently being worked on. The malicious people who released and used the hack did it at a time that they knew most of the office would be gone for the holidays. Any other time things would be taken care of in a quicker manner.
---
Personnally I'm quite happy with the game. Played since beta and have easily got ¬£70 of entertainment over the last year..
---
I've gotten mods as reward for dropped connection event. They just aren't common. You're more likely to get a pre-modded e.plasma as a reward instead.
---
PC EU, event ended after with daily challanges reset
---
Ps4 tried 3 different servers, no gift wrap or Santa scorched.  Hadn't seen any gift drops from the santatron either :/
---
I dont see why you're being so combative. I was just saying some new seasonal stuff would be cool as well.
---
Your welcome to experience it for yourself, friend. Add me hawkeye20085 if your on playstation
---
Your material is bad and you should feel bad!
---
Seen a 1004 lvl at whitespring event months ago.
---
I started F76 in March 2019, my first Fallout game ever, buddy convinced me to have a try.
---
Lvl 400 now with 900hours.. playing as a Commando build rusher (Battlefield 1 style). I somehow regret missing half a year after it was released
---
PS4, eastern time (US). no holiday scorched, no wrapping paper, no santatron gifts when I went to play the game (around 1PM).
---
Don't buy it for that. Much better options.
---
Yes she gave them money, and it brought her happiness. Is there poor programming on their part, sure, but the game is enjoyable by yourself if that what you want. I never wanted an MMO, so I bought fallout 1st. 
---
Did you want a fallout MMO or fallout 5?
---
If you aren't going to buy/play the game then why the fuck are you posting on a sub reddit meant for the game?
---
Yeah I'm looking at some gift wrap at the Sutton station right now, just signed on too.
---
Nonexistent, nobody PVPs anymore. If they do, most of the time the trolls are the ones with god-tier weapons who built themselves JUST to kill people.
---
While personally I scrip all nocturnal items as well, I think your answer sums up what any game is supposed to be. Limiting options to just bloodied or junkies because those are the ‚Äúbest‚Äù would ruin what I remember from fallout 3. You could play how you wanted to.
---
I rarely see anyone using shotguns, but does that mean they should be removed?  
---
Ultimately some people have fun role playing in a role playing game.
---
Dont buy it to be a drama queen. 
---
Buy it because its a fun game. 
---
Bethesda pissed a few people off who also happen to be really loud in exagerated protest of issues that are not really issues for most people.
---
Most of the negative buzz you see these days is created and produced by people who do not even play the game.  They read buzz from other people and put their own personal spin on it.  There were a few diehard fallout fans that expected a different experience, and they have been trying to destroy bethesda since day 1.   This is the hype you are probably seeing.
---
Plastic Forks and Plates are a go-to for gathering the plastic you will need later on!   Good instincts!
---
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
---
Erm, works for me on private worlds.  Santatron collects ok, am finding scorched No probs and can buy wrap. It does state event ends 31 Dec, and that seems to be the case for me.
---
It felt lonely the first time you experienced the world with no players. It was eerie and the world seemed so much bigger. Don't forget to plop your tent down in a good secondary travel spot.
---
Has anyone submitted a ticket for this?  Might help with the visibility.
---
That was kinda the point. After the fallout 1st thing the devs realized that the community will let itself get abused more and more and there is really no limit to this kind of behavior. I mean what if they just decide that the fallout 1st membership from 2020 will be  200 or 400 bucks? Will that shock you? Will it really surprise you? 
---
To the people that are still playing this steaming shit pile abortion of a game, they will eat it up and then go out of their way to defend bethesda. And bethesda knows this. 
---
This is why the hackers had to take matters into their own hands and i guess try to put some sense into these people although i have zero hope for anyone who STILL plays this......i dont even know what the fuck this is even its certainly not a game
---
That was fun I found a ghoulified yao gui to test it out on at site alpha. Little tip you can go in and out of the building I ran inside shot it and it will come to the door then it cant come in so it will leave then just step out start shooting and wait for it to get close before going back inside lol.
---
I haven't participated in Faschnacht event because I play this game since 2 months, but I'd love to. From youtube videos it looked fun, I also don't have all Faschnacht camp plans :(
---
Nocturnal rolling pin.
---
Wrong. All still working.
---
Unfortunately,  xbox
---
Same here.
---
I thought you could store and place them back in and the buttons were fixed
---
Looted a gift on PC like five minutes ago and 3x smalls in my santa-box.   
---
Sounds like bethesda screwed Xbox.   
---
Sad to hear you won't be getting gifts from santa-tron after this...I figured that would be a sweet little left-over easteregg, but of course bethesda can't do \_nice\_ things for the community.
---
I love the game. I have a lv200 melee lv 100 commando a lv 50 commando and two mules. There‚Äôs so much stuff to do in the game it‚Äôs crazy and the player trading is a lot of fun.
---
Shotgun user here. Don't you diss my sugar daddy Enforcer. üò©üëåüçÜüí¶üí¶üí¶
---
I've played for less than a year, I really like the game, but it does have a lot of combat flaws. Scaling and respawning enemies are probably the biggest flaws, especially with high level players nearby.
---
Even at low 40s I haven't been able to complete Keys to the Past because of the high level mirelurks in Wendigo cave.
---
Well bethesda seems to think otherwise - they launched not one but TWO pvp modes in a year . One is gone now , but that does change the fact that Bethesda wanted pvp to be part of this game .
---
Also , Todd said they wanted "drama" before release :)
---
I keep getting a fright when I hear noises. Thinking there is a player behind me. I had avoided other players for so long I think it will take a while for it to sink in that the private world is exactly that... private.
---
I got mine almost instant. Sub renewed, I logged into game few hours later (so it may have taken 2hrs or so), and my atoms were there.
---
The PvP is gear oriented not skill. It can be fun but lots of stealth boys and vats. If you want a competitive PvP experience this is not the game but I have spent and enjoyed a good chunk of time doing it.
---
Hah, I have to find budget for letters now you clever bastard :P
---
Ps4 Pacific Northwest was Santa scorched and gifts in santatron at 7:00 a.m.
---
I actually had that happen to me multiple times. I ended up just stopping playing for a while
---
Affirmative üòá
---
If you're still a low level, yeah definitely I don't think many would argue how engaging and fun the game is when it's all new with so much to do and explore...  for me it's been tough deciding if it's even worth coming back to put the effort in without fallout 1st. I log in, see that it's going to be 30 minutes of picking and dumping stuff I need and want from my stash, only to be instantly full and right back to stash management simulator after 15 mins of clearing one area, then log back out. I've been giving it a try, but... Eh. That part is just time consuming and not fun. I think I'll just pop my head in when wastelanders come out to check out the new content.
---
Use rifleman perks
---
The nuke codes on nuka crypt are actually correct as I'm the one who pulls them to be updated on the site.
---
I hope not, I missed out on this event.
---
two words. Rabid fanboyism.
---
Bummer. I missed a lot of the event early on and only got to play it for two days. Oh well
---
Mine do that. Sometimes if I look at them, the ccx words above them are red like they are an enemy.  I'm waiting for them to start attacking me when I go home.
---
Si
---
They are now, today. When I tried about 11 PM est, last night it was still showing the ones from Dec 17-24. I refreshed and reloaded the page multiple times, and it was still the same. I tried one anyway, and it didn't work. I checked today, and the dates and codes were changed.
---
I was wondering about this as well, I'm on Xbox too and haven't seen sight of a Santa Scorched or had any gifts from my Santatron since I went online at roughly 5pm (GMT)
---
There's actually a few players who have very high DPS Nocturnal builds.  While I myself dislike the trait because of the time limitation, I think it'd be very unfair to just gimp the folks that have invested time and effort into their builds.  If you dislike the items so much, just give them away, but trying to control other players' experiences is just... well, selfish.
---
The codes haven't changed from yesterday as I pulled them 2 days ago
---
I think you'll find this build will put out much more damage. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3d64b8b&amp;d=l71lu2pk2pl2pp2pd2el2c72a72i12i92sg2ic4e82l12p00lt2a04&amp;w=&amp;m=c9f86i3&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
It's still not min/maxed, but it'll wreck stuff faster than the build you had outlined. Lemme know if you have any questions about why I changed things.
---
Surprised more people don't point this out. All Ghouls were "accidentally" on the boss mob EXP table. You could get 3-4 levels just going through Watoga HS event. I have 2x 300 chars. If I had actually tried to level early on instead of playing casual and had one char I would probably be level 800-1000 right now. No exploits needed.
---
happened to me a week ago, first one went crazy and started attacking the others then all of them went mad and I had to scrap them
---
Perhaps for the same reason all trolls come to the subreddit ... we enjoy it!
---
If there was no penalty they would be solid
---
Where do you get the information that search lights improve range and accuracy of turrets near it. That sounds like conjecture.
---
Lol, no I‚Äôm not against them. I keep a combat shotgun that does extra damage against bugs and mirelurks. I‚Äôm just saying it would be silly to start limiting things to just what a lot of people use all the time. I see nothing wrong with shotguns, nocturnal prefixes, or anything else in the game.
---
On Xbox, haven‚Äôt seen any holiday scorched or paper available (SantaTron also isn‚Äôt collecting gifts). From what I‚Äôve read it seems to be working on PC, but not consoles.
---
Oh. I stored them and brought them back out. They were fine till I server hopped. Then they started blasting away again. The thing is I really need them where I'm located so I'm constantly fixing stuff when I get back to camp.
---
yong/head subscriber base in a nutshell.
---
I guess there was something wrong with my connection. I tried 2 different sites, and both were the same for me, not updated.
---
Maybe they should remove your definition of a good roll from the game so you realise how shitty that makes you, let people have fun with their rolls and legendary effects. It‚Äôs not all about you.
---
Seconded for the rabid fangirls.
---
Nope. Not on my end.  Checked several servers and restarted the game twice.
---
You can use ctrl+f5 on pc to refresh a page while also cleaning the pages cache alowkng it to update
---
1. I normally only experience trade menu bugs and a crash every couple days.
---
2. They need money to make the dlc everyone gets for free though the prices can get ridiculous.
---
3. Yup holiday event not work properly for a lot of people after extension 
---
4. This was fixed a day or 2 ago
---
5. A lot of people still.play it because they enjoy the game, I love being able to play fallout with friends, just wish they would've done 4 player co-op instead.
---
That‚Äôs why I built an unbreakable base.
---
The entire social menu is fucked and needs a rework.
---
I am in the toxic area where the lead and scrap nodes can be harvested at the same time and also need them but as soon as they shoot some enemies (mostly deers) they just go crazy. Didn't play since then because I'm with my family rn but gonna see in few day when I'm back
---
Two words: internet outrage.
---
Look OP no ones gonna sell you on this game. Some of us like it in spite of the issues its had. Some people dont. You decide if you let the internet away you one way or the other, that's fine. 
---
But posts like these serve no purpose. Either try it or dont.
---
I'm sort of just running around. How do you get other missions apart from the main quest?
---
to give a proper explanation: This isn't a private world like one you'd expect from say...Conan Exiles, it's still Bethesda's server, the only difference is that no other players can join (except friends)
---
Yes, generally speaking performance feels better across the board. 
---
Mind you that's only with me, solo, vs 24 people or whatever can exist on an adventure mode server
---
In two days! Impressive.
---
I think the sneaky route is better for me... So definitely shooting through windows from now on! Thanks!
---
I have never repeated this before and it is not a joke
---
Yes, there were and are many bugs and glitches, but that‚Äôs normal for any Fallout game in my experience.
---
If by micro transactions you mean the atom shop, then yes, you can buy outfits and decorations. But they do not help you in the game at all. If you mean 1st, well you get a scrap ox with unlimited storage, and a tent. Once again, those may improve game quality of life, but they do not give you any weapons or armor.
---
The hacking was on pc, so I don‚Äôt really have any experience there. 
---
Why are people playing this game?  It‚Äôs fun. We like it.
---
There are also no holiday scorched anymore. Looks like this needs a hotfix....
---
Also Xbox, no more Scorched, Gifts or Paper
---
I was initially against Fallout 1st (being poor) and not relishing the idea of paywall content. But after seeing a few friends get hit by the inventory hack, I bought 1 month of 1st. Can't afford it beyond this month but I'm enjoying it so far. I got to free up 3 Junk Mules by moving Junk to my mains Scrap Box. The outfits are pretty cool too.
---
That‚Äôs was during double xp and I went to events that attracts higher level players.
---
You can begin in our community here by not trying to start a fight. 
---
Your post is only here to start a fight. 
---
You can either listen to the very small minority of haters that have been trying to destroy the game since its inception, or you can listen to the thousands of players who enjoy the game enough to log in every day to experience the joy of the wasteland. 
---
Either way, take your angst somewhere else.
---
yut, ya got that right.
---
Haven't played FO76 in a while myself, but you could add me as well, same name as here :D But I'll try my best if you need any help with the game :)
---
If this game is as bad as some would say it would definitely not be worth playing but since it or any game could not possibly be perfect it comes down to what do you want to do? Play fallout76 or something else either way there will be people on both sides yelling how bad or good or in some cases OK the game is . . why rely on someone's opinion on whether you will enjoy the game try for yourself and see.

Whitesprings golf club house. With marsupial, up onto the canopy of the back entrance. Kill all enemies thru the windows. I usually Melee to save on ammo.
---
i have 2 rockets they mostly kill rats, but my one turret seems to not like my Santatron, this has been normal for a while and always is enemy for me
---
On Xbox, on a private server, have Santartrons at my camp &amp; 7 claimed workshops. No presents in 2 hours, and no holiday Scorched anywhere. No wrapping paper at the vendors either. üò≠
---
Thanks! I've noticed quite a lot of detail... Like how the skeletons almost tells a story of how they died. Kinda morbid... But sometimes a bit funny.
---
Thank you for this post. I been wandering around for like an hour and not seeing a single santa scorched.
---
Mine do it intermittently, I noticed the one that usually started first, so I scrapped that one. I've got super mutants, scorched, mole miners, and sometimes 2 scorched beasts in my area so I had 9 missle turrets. If it wasn't for my vending machines going down when the generator blows, i wouldn't worry much about it. But when the generator goes, no one will see my camp on the map.
---
Anyone else remember how Bethesda said they‚Äôd be more clear with when events end following the Halloween NW events?
---
I would love the idea to have planters inside of my camp. There is a watchtower in the bog that has these mini planters with crops in them. Please add this item! FYI if they do it will most likely be an atomic shop item
---
Yep in the ash heap it has a chance to spawn. May need to server hop it‚Äôs a fairly rare event.
---
Oh, I thought that was how it's supposed to be.
---
Oh well....
---
500+ players supposedly hacked by one person in a very short period of time (less than 24 hours) Major disaster right there.
---
Now hold on, ESO has been revamped perfectly since the launch, which I was a beta player of, and much has been made enjoyable IMO. At least there you have an enormous world to explore and just as many quest lines to pursue. Linking with friends is a hell of a lot easier than 76 with guilds and you can actually play with them. 76 was what I would compare it to the Point Lookout dlc just larger. It was rushed and it showed. I got whatever I could get out of it, minus fancy camp designing cuz I didn‚Äôt buy this to spend hours making a house and I‚Äôve deleted the launcher and moved on. I highly doubt I‚Äôll be back for the NPC thing cuz they‚Äôll be other great titles coming out the same time(FF7 remake, CyberPunk 2077, etc...)
---
Unfortunately you and your wife will have to be patient until at least after the holidays. Bethesda is on a short staff right now so can't do much
---
[There's already a post about this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/efy89b/hey_bethesda_the_holiday_scorched_event_ends_the/)
---
Looks normal to me. Wait until you see the ghosting in the Mire.
---
Also he was online not even 12 hours ago. They haven‚Äôt done anything to him despite video evidence
---
I'm going to list what keeps me in this game.
---
1. Survival mode
---
2. The world space
---
3. The best community of any survival game
---
4. Camp building
---
When it comes down to what I have listed Fallout 76 far surpasses any previous Fallout ever made in the listed regards. (With the exception of the community point.) If you don't care about anything I have listed and want something with a story foremost then this is not the game for you. As someone who lives in low level zones and helps new players I can't tell you how many times new players tell me how they actually ended up loving the game after trying it.
---
Could be server dependant, aka results may vary.
---
That‚Äôs means they should have given you the atoms points each month, if not that‚Äôs misleading the consumer.
---
I‚Äôm genuinely not trying to troll. Just understand if I should get into this game
---
You have to be a certain lvl to wear them. I believe combat armor is min lvl20. Cant remember marine lvl.
---
I continue to play because I enjoy it.. 
---
want to tell me what car I should drive or that my choice of beer is wrong?
---
Care to tell me what problems I should be having?  
---
Crashing? Maybe once a week, 
---
Paid $60 for it got over 500 hours into it.
---
Paid $60 for RDR2.. played for 3 hours 
---
Paid $50 for outer worlds.. got about 40 hours of gameplay..
---
Which do you think was the better buy?
---
Cut off what?
---
Switch to swing speed- you‚Äôll do more damage faster
---
I still have 10+ copies of every mask, multiples of every plan, and berets out the yin-yang. I don't need any more.
---
Explore the map. You'll discover new locations which sometimes give you a new side mission or daily mission.  Also talk to any robots which aren't trying to kill you and read notes/listen to holotapes. Also loot bodies you find laying around in the world.  Before long you will have too many missions to even know where to start.
---
[There's already a post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/efy89b/hey_bethesda_the_holiday_scorched_event_ends_the/).
---
As someone who has played alot of 76 since b.e.t a I'd say go into your Pip-Boy(arm computer) and go to the junk tab and mark screws and springs to help you find them. They are some of the more scarce junk items and you need them for quite a few things. So marking them will let you know what has them in them. Also if you find any guns that you dont need scrap them down at the nearest bench for parts.
---
Holiday scorched event and got rid of wrapping paper
---
Just to follow up, got a gift in the tron just now, so that hasn't been turned off.
---
[There's already a post about this issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/efy89b/hey_bethesda_the_holiday_scorched_event_ends_the/).
---
I mean the posts I listed are the top on the sub right now. Not trying to start a fight just want to know why y‚Äôall are still playing
---
It was a really fun event so I hope they keep most of the aspects the same but widen the loot pool and maybe add new things
---
I'm on PC. Oooh, I think managed to make it to level 10 eventually, but just because I accidentally happened onto an event and got points from completing a quest that other completed. The other points are from cooking, scrapping and wandering.
---
Very sweet of you, thanks! I got some stuff from other players, but can only start using them from level 15...
---
I know it's crazy stong
---
(Ps4 user)
---
Everything seems faster for me, the load time when. You dont have first is about 3-5 minutes for me, but with first its easily cut in half. I have noticed less rubber banding too, loading in white springs building, etc. The bugs are still there in full effect, but for me, the servers are much more stable.
---
Oh no more holiday scorched, I‚Äôm sure they said the 31st
---
Huh, I actually did receive one. But why does this feel like a trap???
---
I dont see any pixel, even when zooming
---
Not sure if it was emphasized enough- better not to try to shoot at her while in the air at all. This makes her more reluctant to land. And also explosives are not only useless but quite often harmful since they screw up other players‚Äô audio/video and make general high load on computing/rendering of the scene .
---
Dang missed whole event.  Was bout to just log in too.
---
Awesome, nifty tip. Thamks!
---
I meant mmo instead of borderlands style fallout. Everytime I said I wanted online skyrim/fallout I meant skyrim/fallout with 4 people, campaign stuff.
---
So you're glad that people who enjoy and choose to play this game are getting fucked over by hackers?
---
Cool cool.
---
What system? Currently on PC and getting Holiday Scorched and gift wrap in vendors.
---
I mean my post was genuinely listing 5 of the top 20 posts on the sub, I made no judgement just listed what I saw. 
---
Y‚Äôall the ones getting argumentative. I genuinely want to know if this game is worth it cus based on the posts and problems a year later it doesn‚Äôt look like it to me.
---
Perhaps I can screenshot some pics. It is literally just north of v9. When you stand on the southern most edge of the platform and look down your almost directly above v9s north fence.
---
They did say that but after today‚Äôs new challenge update came everything is gone I guess they don‚Äôt know what day it is
---
LOL this guy has more faith in Bethesda than what is warranted. It would not surprise me to see the event rolled out exactly as it was with a slight tweak to the RNG.
---
Its all been taken by the remote inventory hack, he doesnt have anymore to sell
---
Read my edit.
---
Also if you dont want to worry about getting diseases from food or water I'd look into the food perks under Endurance. It's a bit of ease of mind knowing if you are dying of thirst you can just chug the nearest bog water without worry.
---
I'm on PC (might be different on consoles), but nothing changed here, still going strong.
---
I kill the queen in a minute if it stays on the ground. Dps will over take power attack but there is no monster with a health pool large enough for that to happen. You can gain swing speed through martial artist but cannot gain that 40% damage boost any other way besides that prefix.
---
do you believe everything you read on the internet?
---
Do you think Vice and Dangerous Minds are also solid respectable news sources. 
---
Do you really think that eating tide pods is good for you?
---
Just go away, we dont want your cynical kind.  You made your decision before you ever posted.  The language used in your post states as much, and the rest of us who arnt buying into the overinflated egos of youtube haters see right through  you.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm on Xbox that‚Äôs probably why, still doesn‚Äôt really make any sense though but that‚Äôs Bethesda
---
I made a specific section about shooting her in the head interrupting her landing animation. You should probably read the post.
---
Ah, will do...thanks.
---
I'm just at the beach for a couple of days. On vacation, but when I get back I'll add you. Xx
---
Thats not exactly bug free though is it, thats a temp fix until it happens again, providing of course the game lets you snap them back to where they were, which on my builds was never an option
---
you are tryign to troll, the language and scope of your post is exactly how a troll would phrase this.
---
No I did not have pacifist turned on. You still receive damage by players even if pacifist is on. My guess he was exploiting or cheating, but this did happen when I was only lvl 13 or something like that.
---
That is a good point.  There are always ways of making the game harder on yourself.
---
I have a load of firecracker berries around my camp... every time they go off a little piece of me dies!
---
I got it for a month last month and renewed without hesitation..it means I can focus on the game and the resource management aspect to it. Plus when I do a resource run I know the stuff will be there
---
Ive only got my one owl mask left and 5-6 to each of the other commons. Running a bit low on the plans, but still have most of plans but am missing extras of a few.
---
I am really hoping to pick up the C.A.M.P. plans from last year! I haven't been lucky enough to find any of the plans through player vending. I do understand where you're coming from and I hope they're able to expand the event this year!
---
Sweet of you, thanks.
---
I'll add you when I get back from my mini holiday. :)
---
Was not in a team. Had no friends to play with at the time.
---
Thanks man the only comment that didn‚Äôt get personally offended for me pointing out the top posts. 
---
This was the response I was looking for!
---
PC doesn't seem to have a problem, and I'm hearing mixed comments on PS4.  Time for a ticket maybe?
---
Having permanent workshops would be awesome. But I wouldn‚Äôt recommend having anymore than around 4.
---
The amount of defend missions you have to attend to is noticeable and can be distracting from other activities. 
---
Each workshop added after this only exasperates the problem. 
---
I took all the workshops one time and literally by the time I cleared one defend and went to the next. The defend at the previous workshop had fired up. It was mayhem just endlessly hoping from one workshop to another!
---
If someone came to your community asking if they should join and you automatically assume he‚Äôs a troll for pointing out the top posts in your community I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not looking well lol
---
Yup! Same with partial cores on gatling lasers. Little annoyances like that kill me.
---
The things people complain about on this sub is ridiculous.  In short, you think you deserve more because you made it more difficult on yourself by going at it solo.  The actual rewards are in Standard and Expert mode. Novice is pretty much just a practice mode.
---
Good. I hope there's even more. The more post the better. Let Bethesda see they messed up
---
What platform are those of you still getting them and the wrapping paper on? I'm PS4 and nothing.
---
im over here still waiting for my 600 vault steel
---
Right, but I meant not only head but general shooting at her in the air.
---
They‚Äôre the top posts lmfao. You guys upvoted them not me. No need to get angry. Just curious why people are playing and whether I should too
---
They better not remove the nw holiday rewards early
---
Well, you can either play the game with your friend, or you can look for excuses not to spend time with your friend. 
---
Than you should even need to ask shows the strength of your character.
---
Bye felicia.
---
One day you will all realize you should've quit at launch.
---
def was not just 1, the one recorded it but we def dont know how many actually used it.
---
No.
---
Flooding this subreddit with repeat posts about the same issue does nothing to help. It doesn't force Bethesda's hand, it doesn't make them more likely to address the issue. One post is already on the front page of the subreddit.
---
All repeat posts do is make more work for the mods.
---
I buy up all the 5.56 and .45 I find and then use it to hunt down legendary weapons which I then try to sell or convert to scrip
---
The drops are nothing special. I‚Äôve seen mounted plans for as low as 50 to 100 caps in camp vendors.
---
I just sold a nocturnal fixer for 12500 caps last night. Guy is a full noc build.
---
OMFG Bethesda is too incompetent to do even that right without any issues.
---
Lol the turrets instead of defending the camp they destroy your stuff..
---
That's weird, I just was on making armor for my son (new player &amp; character) checked my santatron and there were gifts in there.  I haven't been on since last night.  Maybe they were from last night.
---
The common ones are cheap, but some of the rarer ones fetch prices in excess of 10k.
---
I agree.  I just don‚Äôt like it equipped all the time for my play style.
---
In the first 4-6 months the game came out is was pretty much essential because armour broke so fast otherwise, mostly from that damn scorch beast poison attack that just tore it to shreds.
---
They patch the good ones out but can‚Äôt patch any other bugs lol
---
Ummm I hang out with this friend IRL, work out, bike, eat. 
---
We just don‚Äôt play many games together and fallout is one of the few genres we overlap on. 
---
Thanks for the personal attack though. Truly strength of character
---
This was there attempt at an endgame and it failed. We need better rewards and solo options
---
I just looted a nocturnal explosive .50cal today, gonna use it to kill the queen later.
---
What system? From what I understand PS4 and PC still have gifts.
---
Does the wrapping paper Exist in your Inventory?
---
Yh sorry man just getting annoyed with people wantin all this new stuff when the games strugglin as it is. I just love this damn game and feel like both Bethesda and it‚Äôs community are damaging it
---
I can confirm, it's still there for me after a relog at Watoga Station too.  I'm on PC.  This could be a platform-specific phenomenon.
---
I am ps4 btw... If that has any ramifications
---
It was my favorite event besides mischief night and I miss it. It was always cute to watch people "march" With the robots and act silly.
---
I‚Äôd like to see them rework it. Currently it‚Äôs lower damage during the day, and progressively higher the later at night it gets. That makes it pretty pointless compared to other effects. 
---
However, if it would simply be an extra 50% at night‚Äî6pm to 6am like Mr. Sandman‚Äîit would be pretty cool for stealth builds.
---
Facts. Consoles don‚Äôt get an extension because they didn‚Äôt have a player base in hiding due to a hack
---
Yeah they would shoot my Brahmin and collectron so I got rid of them
---
Only PC gets the extension
---
Well that is the first I have heard about that. I have near seen her do her stagger animation when shooting her wings I will have to test this to see.
---
*laughs evily in finding the game fun*
---
Use melee weapons instead of guns as much as possible.  I am TERRIBLE at shooting from the hip so I use melee weapons for the  most part.  Just look in the direction of the enemy when they are close and start spamming your trigger/combat button.  Also, if you do want to use a gun, use VATS (left shoulder button here on Xbox).  This will auto-aim you and allow you to keep firing as long as you have AP (action points...bottom right of screen).
---
Also, follow the main storyline to tell you where you should be.  Stick around the Forest for a while, then head up to the airport and up to Toxic Valley.  But stick around the Forest for as long as you want.  There's lots to do and lots of junk to pick up to help you build your CAMP, weapons, and armor!
---
That's not what I'm saying. I "dont think I deserve more because I soloed the raid". I think WE ALL deserve better rewards period. IMO It's just not worth it
---
It‚Äôs only on PC cause you didn‚Äôt have hackers.
---
They announced the extension in the article before the hack appeared...
---
I was expecting to get leather at least
---
I agree, 
---
     Camp defenses are in need of revamping.
---
I had my camp near the flooded tail yard, noticed a number of scorch beasts off in the distance so I thought missle turrets and set out five spread across the perimeter of my camp on towers.
---
     One of the beasts, with his bat like head and radiation trail following, took notice of my incursion into his space, but I felt confident.
---
     As he approached all five were engaging the massive winged nightmare, the health bar barely moved.  Soon he had wrecked the turrets, burnt holes in various parts of the shelter and broken the lead extractor.
---
Not working for me, just awesome
---
You believe whatever you want, Keith.  Doesn't change the facts which I pointed out earlier in the thread.
---
PC only for the extension
---
I believe Bethesda fixed it the day after the tool was released. Granted that means the bug was around for a week. But it should be fine now.
---
It was supposed to be for all platforms.
---
What do you think would be an appropriate reward for completing a raid on Standard or Expert?
---
On Xbox I just checked my Santa trons after a 2 hour soak and have nothing. Will maybe try a fresh server later. Kind of a bummer, was hoping to farm more gifts
---
They never said it was for all platforms.
---
I just used the rug glitch with corn the other day and it worked great.
---
No, I'm on PS4. The event is not still going on. No 'festive' scorched in the wild and no wrapping paper in the vendors. Bethesda forgot to leave the event in the 'On' position.
---
Don't look at a sheepsquatch the wrong way.
---
That's BS. The end date was announced before the hack happened.
---
I didn‚Äôt have any. I made all my gifts and opened them last night.
---
1200+ hours on PC, none of that has been an issue in any way for me.  I know it's a thing, but it's not something I've ever run across.
---
That said, nuclear winter/battle royale is rife with cheaters (but I don't play that), and I switched to a low level for a day when the last exploit was going around, just to be safe.
---
Before it was released, not before it was threatened
---
If they didn't specify, then it was supposed to be for all platforms.
---
And did they state it was for PC only at that point?
---
They announced the extension well before the PC hack happened. The reason was that it‚Äôs the days between Xmas and New Year‚Äôs that people have time off to play, not the week before. They should fix the event so that everyone gets it as originally planned. 
---
I‚Äôd have no problem with an additional extension for PC players in light of the hack, but I also don‚Äôt see why any PC players should be offended if that were to go to everyone.  Console players getting an extra few days of fun doesn‚Äôt affect anyone‚Äôs experience on PC.
---
Hmm idk. I see posts from both, some say it still works, some say it doesn't. I am in private world.
---
True but its still funny
---
Solo run on Novice takes me 20 -30 minutes and hardly any bullets because im melee mostly. Sorry this took you 2 hours so many stims and ammo but you can do it more efficiently than this with just a bit of the right gear and knowing what your doing.
---
Well at least it'll be added
---
If there were threats on a hack I‚Äôd assume that, that platform would be the one who gets the event extended
---
Good to hear!
---
Have you considered an exciting career in melee combat?
---
What‚Äôs the crash Santa going for?
---
Avoid materialistic pursuits; just go have fun and don't worry too much about an imaginary market. Appalachia is a wasteland, and as such should be wasted in kind.
---
It was announced before the hacks
---
Yeah that's what I'm thinking maybe. I'm in UK, don't know if other ppl in the US are affected differently.
---
Watch out, the downvoting warrios can hear the negativity from miles away
---
Ah. Gotcha.
---
I have one listed at about 7-8K (not in game right now), but haven't sold any.  I did sell a mothman for a bit over 10K
---
They announced the extension back on 12/17 in their Inside the Vault article. Well before erectban released the inventory hack
---
Yawn!
---
Yeah I was just able to buy on mine (I'm on PC) but my hubby couldn't (he's on PS4). I wonder if that makes any difference?
---
I loved it too. It is also one of my favoutes
---
They cannot fix that
---
**citation needed*
---
Scaling can be a bit ridiculous. If there is a high level player nearby or just walked through the area, they can spawn level 60+ enemies.
---
Another time I wiped out about ten level 30 Super Mutants, then they all almost instantly respawned at level 40+ when a high level player entered the same area. I was killed almost instantly.
---
This is a great question honestly, I don't know
---
Looks like PC only. Consoles seem to be out of the event, at least for now.
---
I can confirm that as of writing at 3:24pm EST 
---
I am looking at gift wrap in a robot vendor (whitesprings trainstation) on PC.
---
That is specific to wrapping paper, this is about the whole event.
---
They did not, but that‚Äôs what I mean a Bethesda fuck up.
---
Same here.  Seems like PC is fine on this one, just the console players who are affected.
---
True. I‚Äôd buy it if I‚Äôm being honest with you
---
That is specific to the wrapping paper. This is the whole event, specific to the 'festive' scorched in the wild. Thank you for adding the link, however. Was going to add that to the list.
---
It's not legal to hack foreigh entities in Russia. But hacking is not a kind of crime which is persecuted unconditionally. So the police will not persecute hackers if there is no complaint from the victim. 
---
I think it's too much hassle for Bethesda, which has no Russian branch, to initiate a case in Russia, as well as in many other countries.

I played a long time as a semi auto sneak sniper build.. found only one point in each rifleman perk to be fine, rather have 3 points in concentrated fire. I don‚Äôt think ‚Äòlong shot‚Äô is necessary. 
---
I would not use ‚Äòpack rat‚Äô, rather put points in luck or agility. I never found that I was short of stimpaks or radaway, so to me these are wasted points in intelligence... same with thru hiker, especially if you have points in cannibal for satisfying hunger. 
---
I like vats so 3 points in ‚Äògung ho‚Äô is a must, it‚Äôs a great perk, adrenaline is also good but after a certain point in the game 90% of enemies can be one shotted so damage cards can be replaced with others.

This was my build as a lever action sneak sniper, bloodied:

Jesus Christ that would be infuriating.
---
Would love a screenshot
---
This is untrue. All platforms were supposed to get the extension
---
I like to eat ham and jam and spam alot, I like to push the pram alot.
---
Nice! I‚Äôm missing the mothman and icicle lights. Was hoping to trade out for a set. I grinder pretty hard and have 8-9 each of the more common ones. Also lots of prime plans. No luck with icicle lights tho.
---
Seeing how people on console are whining about the event being over meanwhile on PC I‚Äôm still finding scorched and gifts. It only makes sense PC would get it
---
Then why are consoles apparently not getting event items while they‚Äôre still on PC?
---
Did they?
---
I feel your pain. I'm only lvl 31 at this point and I still scream when something jumps out at me. It's ok though. Things get better! Feel free to add me (name is the same) if you're on pc. :)
---
Those turrets hate the Santatron
---
I found sometimes depending on your level, melee works better, and then others guns do. You will learn quick melee is much more powerful in this game. It is generally hard until you get to level 10-15. Once you at level 15, you should be able to handle yourself, so don't worry, just realize you got to level up and you will be fine .. takes a while.
---
It‚Äôs another screw up from Bethesda. It was announced back on 12/17 the event would be extended.
---
&gt; Next was a post about micro transactions.... looked up the premiere video of todd Howard saying ‚Äúno micro transactions‚Äù. I definitely lol‚Äôd at this one.
---
He never said that.
---
&gt; I guess what I‚Äôm trying to figure out is why y‚Äôall are playing? 
---
You seem to have your mind made up about this game, so why are YOU here?
---
&gt; What makes this game‚Äôs massive flaws and lies worth the time and money investment.
---
It is still fun.
---
The half staircase would also be nice.
---
All of them.
---
It is your phrasing. You decided to pick out the worst posts and laugh about them without even knowing any of their context, like the inventory exploit, which has been fixed already. Your whole posts comes off as mocking rather than wanting honest answers.
---
If you're genuinely interested, here is my list of things to do in FO76:  
---
1. Make a build I am comfortable with playing.  
---
2. Make that build as strong as possible without being a glass cannon.  
---
3. Set your own goal mindset while playing/exploring.  
---
4. Collect all plans/recipes on all 5 characters.  
---
5. Do dailies and weekly challenges for the free atoms.  
---
6. Help all player whenever wherever (my responder tag is not just for show).  
---
7. Brew all kinds of alcohol (whiskey works best for me so I have \~250 units in each character).  
---
And so on ...  
---
But these are the things that lead me to clock over a thousand hours in the game (shame NW are not counted).  
---
I got my worth out of my money, without experiencing a lot of the problems reported here.
---
Yeah...the Santa were suppose to still be here but nope, they're gone! Totally disappointed bc I missed a lot.
---
Looks normal to me. Is your video card failing?
---
Fwiw, I sold a Santa for 5k within an hour of putting it in the machine. Either you're overpriced, or someone got a deal from me üòÇ
---
And it's fun again.
---
You pointed out no facts.
---
You came here to shitpost, I hurt your feelings.
---
Please go cry some more.
---
I encourage you to not stop dropping acid. In fact, you should stop by my camp and buy all of my acid for your acid dropping pleasure. The burning sensation will go away..
---
It's not my job to look at every little post made to see if something already has been discussed. I will post about what I want when I want &amp; as many times as I want. I could care less if someone. gets butthurt because of it. Block me if seeing multiple post hurts your tender little heart.
---
No, they're just dumb.
---
Thank you so much!  I've participated in a couple of these fights, and mostly concentrated on staying out of the 'experts' (aka high levels who clearly know what they are doing) way, and trying to kill off enemies that are attacking them on the ground while they are focused on the Queen.  I may not have the right weapons to do the damage to actually get any rewards from the Queen, but I like participating anyway.
---
If you dont like it then piss off.
---
And judging from the amount of people responding it looks like they too have not see the other post &amp; I'm happy to get this out there &amp; make others aware of the issue.
---
I figure the santa stuff will get less popular over time, so I'm probably high since is hasn't sold.  The icicle lights will probably stay popular a while, and the heads will stay up there a ways.
---
What the hell are you talking about? I'm on xbox and it literally says in the News feed, that comes up every time you start the game, that the event is going until the 31st.
---
You piss of idiot
---
Dont start flame threads. Go play fortnite
---
I agree it would be difficult. They'd have to completely change the route.
---
Why are you called Shepard when you sound like a üêë? One game being bad doesn't mean FO76 gets a free pass.

You're assigning intent when there's nothing to back that up.

I'm not saying you're wrong, but until someone explains the situation, it's just guesswork.

It was painstakenly hard to do Faschnat due to my low level (lvl 25ish) at the time and the people dropping nukes on the event.
---
&gt;It's not my job to look at every little post made to see if something already has been discussed.
---
All you had to do was look at the first couple posts on the front page of the subreddit. It would've taken less time than actually making this post took.
---
&gt;I could care less if someone. gets butthurt because of it. Block me if seeing multiple post hurts your tender little heart.
---
Why is it that users like you always get so pissy?
---
Bye Felicia
---
Gather and make food as much as possible.  Use that to heal outside of combat.  Save the stimpaks for emergencies during combat.
---
Yet you waste your valuable time posting on reddit.... makes total sense to me.
---
Sounds like you are doing exactly what you need to do. Showing up and helping with crowd control! Do your best to get in the necessary damage to get loot off the SBQ. This is a great way to build up repair kits and flux for prime ammo and mods, serums, or power armor mods.
---
Oh man, NV had great weapons some of my favorites were fricken pistols.  That Gun was one of my favorites. I wish 76 had the same weapon build versatility.  Not that you cannot do a pistol build, it's just never going to be super strong end game.
---
Greatest Fallout weapon of all time though was Bozar in Fallout 2. That is just pure undisputable fact.  I think it got added into NV in the gunrunners add-on, but it wasn't the same sadly.
---
And ALSO then just DMd me saying "go fuck yourself imbreed". WOW. Get help man. Fast.
---
FWIW, the crafted presents, at least the largest one, seems to be a *much* better source of plans, at least most of them.  I frequently get 2-3 plans on top of the junk and cash.
---
I haven't gotten the plasma grenade (but did get the mine).  I have gotten 8 icicles.  I've probably spent 60-70K on plans though, in addition to grinding a lot.
---
Appears so for those not on PC
---
I cleared Big Bend 3x today and go no Holiday Scorched.
---
I checked Whitesprings Station for Wrapping Paper and I found no wrapping paper.
---
Usually about 200 looking for group posts at any given time- Really good for jumping in to end game events when you‚Äôre high level. From what I understand the other platforms‚Äô social features could really benefit from an LFG-type system
---
Ahh awesome, there are currently some hackers going rampant soo take your time on the beach. Its not really beach time here.
---
Idk, maybe we should get items based on factions actually in this game first?
---
Yeah they heard PC was getting robbed so they figure hey let's spread this holiday cheer to everyone
---
My defenses work pretty well, to the point that I rarely even get to shoot attacking mobs. But it took quite a bit of tweaking of positioning and implementing a "bait" system. Some key factors - 
---
1- Location: My camp is on the highest point in it's area, surrounded on two sides by cliff drops. It's back from the cliff far enough that neither I nor my visitors spawn off the edge, but doesn't leave much room for mobs. It also has some terrain drops in the direction that mobs CAN spawn, and an open area surrounded by trees that limits mob line of sight a bit.  Basically, it funnels the mobs such that they come at my base from one direction, and one at a time. (every once in a while, I'll hear mobs trying to shoot me from the bottom of the cliff... it makes for some fun grenade fishing)
---
2- Turret Placement: My turrets on on the roof of a 2-3 story multi-level structure, with a few on "shelves" (single square wire floor sections) built into the exterior wall one level down. I have 3 missile turrets, 6 heavy laser turrets and one Heavy MG turret (covering a blind spot where wiring was tricky). 2 of the missile turrets and 3 of the lasers on covering the "main" mob approach from the highest part of my base. The rest are lower and covering side angles and blind spots. Not that you are doing this, but since I see this occasionally, I should mention - NO TURRETS ON THE GROUND. Those are just mole rat food\*. Using a foundation is also a bad idea, in that naked foundations essentially function as free stairs on all sides  for both you and any mobs. Get the turrets off the ground, and fence or wall off the entrance to that spot. (there is no path to my 3rd floor gun roof platform without marsupial). 
---
3- Bait:  \* Did I mention "Mole Rat Food"? I literally do this. I figured out where most of my mobs spawn, and then placed a single tato plant (doesn't matter which crop) at the edge of my build area, in clear line of sight of my turrets. The critter type mobs go straight for the tato. While it still takes a second for Turrets to wake, they rarely even let my plant get damaged. You can also do this with just a random piece of fence (mobs seem to hate fences almost as much as they hate tatos... ). 
---
So far this has been very successful. I generally don't even bother leaving my crafting station when I hear my turrets fire, as even the high level mutants that occasionally wander through seem to die pretty quick. Only thing that gives me any trouble is wolves, and they still die, just closer to my door/brahmin than I'd like. ;)
---
Because users like you seem to think it's their job to tell others what they should &amp; shouldnt do on Reddit...who cares if people post multiple times about the same subject. You see it as a bad thing &amp; I see it as a positive. If there's an issue with the game the more its discussed the more likely it will get resolved. When legendary effects were being broke because of reloading guns the Reddit feed was flooded with those posts &amp; Bethesda got on that quick. Its good for the community when we collectively emraise awareness....not when we let one person post about it while the rest sit back and hope.
---
Me, too!  I have such FOMO on all the fun rewards folks got last time around - hopefully those will be available for us, and some fun new things for those who played last time around, too.
---
It‚Äôs in servers on PC. Sorry about your luck
---
I agree. The large handmade gifts were the way to go. I did get some decent ones from the many santatrons I put down as well.  Dang, 8 icicle plans! I also got the plasma mine but no grenade.
---
I spent the morning taking workshops on my private server, setting up santatrons at all of them, and they weren't producing any gifts.... what've waste of time... üòì
---
I don't know the values, but it seems pretty decent if you combine it with the sneak attack bonus from Mister Sandman. With Covert Operative you get an extra 3.75x the damage.
---
Doesn't work during the day? Just swap to something else.
---
Chad is the best.
---
Its lvl 35, so you wont get endgame pricing. 
---
You might be able to pull 2k for it.  Limb damage is pretty useless.  Effectively, this is a 1\* weapon.
---
You may be able to get 1k from somebody who wants it for a mule or just really desperate for a bloody 50 cal but generally not very sought after roll. You‚Äôd get better results if you posted this to a certain market sub that I can‚Äôt talk about.
---
same. tried all 3 plants today, fully restored to 100%. still not working
---
if i recon it's the first time stuff is broken on consoles and working on pc
---
True.
---
Strength: I'd switch out Pack Rat for Traveling Pharmacy, since you're mostly likely to hold onto chems longer than junk. You could probably keep Blocker in the event your enemy gets too close.
---
Endurance: Unless your dead set with being a cannibal I'd replace it with Good Doggy and rank 2 Cola Nut. Especially rank 2 Cola Nut, since it also triples the effects like ap gain.
---
Perception: I'd switch out Long Shot for at least rank 1 Concentrated Fire to help with close encounters, unless you can reliably aim at close range or hip shot fire accurately. If you use grenades the remaining two could either be for rank 2 Grenadier or rank 1 Grenadier and rank 1 Fire in the Hole should you have issues with grenade trajectory. If not I'd move two points into Agility for rank 1 Born Survivor and rank 1 Adrenaline.
---
Luck: I'd replace Grim Reaper's Sprint with Bloody Mess for more a consistent damage boost.
---
Idk why you‚Äôre getting downvoted, you‚Äôre literally just making a suggestion lol
---
Wallace in Harpers Ferry tends to have good stuff for sale in addition to Chad, the Watoga station, and Phoenix (middle of Watoga). If you have not frequented Harpers Ferry much, just be warned, high level Super Mutants can spawn there and be a pain (also ghouls or scorched but they are far less painful). Wallace is hanging out in the middle-ish, easy to get to.
---
I semi-agree and semi-don't on this one.... I'm of two minds, I think.
---
I'm just like you- I primarily play solo all the time, and would love the ability to be able to do things by myself.  I'm not really that great of a gamer, but I still love to play-- but I really hesitate playing in groups because I'm concerned about holding folks back who actually ARE good at gaming. I think I get embarrassed honestly!  Also, I can have a weird playing schedule, so coordinating times can be tough.
---
That said, I would love to find a group of similar folks on PS4 who maybe are primarily solo players but who are interested in joining up for things - and who don't mind players like me tagging along.
---
she's rockin' a nub...a scorched nub
---
Same tbh
---
&gt;Because users like you seem to think it's their job to tell others what they should &amp; shouldnt do on Reddit...
---
What I'm trying to *explain* to you is that repeat posts are a waste of time. You can keep making them if you'd like, but they aren't going to help and are only going to make people less likely to come to this subreddit as every time they do they just see a front page with 10 posts about the same issue.
---
&gt;If there's an issue with the game the more its discussed the more likely it will get resolved.
---
And you can discuss it in the already existing post about the issue. As I already explained, flooding the subreddit with repeat posts about an issue that's on the front page does nothing to increase the chances of Bethesda addressing it. That's just not how it works.
---
And given that the various duplicate posts about this issue that have cropped up since the first one I linked to have been removed by the mods (including yours)...well, it seems the people who run this subreddit agree with my stance.
---
Payback for all the console guys who laughed at PC guys getting hacked.
---
Yes hence why I said 1 more week of solo farming presents... Omg I'm so upset I loved this event. It suited my playstyle and my repetitive farming style
---
Vault-Tec Agricultural Centre has at least 2 hoes inside.
---
Start that Harem!
---
They must not be cause my two missile turrets and two machine turrets melt everything short of SB's. Never seen Derpclaws by my camp though. I also once had an open layout camp with two machine turrets on each corner in the swamp area and never died cause they'd melt everything.
---
Xbox EST.

It appears to be all consoles

Holy shit I just drank a carp tonof  punch bowl and it most likely was filled with nukashine and now I'm going all over the map

Okay bait, execution could be better.

Aww did I hurt your feelings?

Lol! 
---
You so poor that you cant even get a PS plus üòÇ
---
I want to thank all of you for the help. I‚Äôm QuickRing learning that most people who play this game are quick to help and very friendly!
---
\*Cough\*RULE9\*Cough\*
---
ok so the inventory bug is currently fixed?  I could purchase it today and play without fear of that big?
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
The atomic shop atoms and items are above reasonable. You can manage just fine without spending real money.
---
There are numerous walkthroughs and help guides posted on youtube and reddit and discord. There's heaps of gameplay and the quests seem impossible to complete. I am not going to lie to you, you will die.
---
I have already seen and reported him for uncivil content.
---
Hopefully the Mods have done their diligence on this guy.
---
Just report him and have his posts removed.
---
How the hell can you solo this raid? As soon as I enter the Vault door, the game crashes.
---
Thx so much for answering. What is the event's name? I have duckduckgo-ed the whatsit out of this &amp; can find no reference to it anywhere. Is it under daily's or side events or something else do you know?
---
This is not a witch hunt. its a warning.
---
I came across a camp in which access to the Santatron was strategically positioned to where a passerby could not access or reach the slot thingy to steal from and my mind was totally blown. It wasn't like it was some intricate design, but just so simple and the only way to get to it is for her to stash away his/her walls. It was brilliant. I decided to do the same since my lock has been picked multiple times.
---
I found a holiday scorched when I was on a about 6 hours ago, but haven't been on since  (on Xbox)
---
his first post has already been removed by mods.
---
I will turn my Santatron into Chadwick the Pimptron, brb.
---
The Bloody and Limb Damage are good traits but the level being 35 will hold you back.  If you go to the other subreddit that cannot be named, you might be able to find a favorable trade.  The highest cap price i can see it going is between 1500 to 2500 being very generous.
---
The exploit has been patched.  No guarantees that something else doesn't come up at some point, but you can say the same thing for any game.
---
And honestly, you'll be a couple hundred hours in before you'll have gear that can't be replaced easily, so even if something popped up tomorrow, you'd be safe for quite a while.
---
Said fuck it and bought it . It‚Äôll be downloaded tonight can‚Äôt wait to see wassup wit it
---
I agree that workshops make PvP interesting in this game but it is very frustrating when I‚Äôm trying to farm some lead just to get murdered by two lv100+ with legendary weapons.
---
They couldn‚Äôt possibly have made a mistake...
---
Lmao that's funny........
---
I don't think this particular hack was very prolific. In general there is a lot of cheating on the PC version, especially in Nuclear Winter. They haven't fixed these issues yet. If you don't care about pvp then it's likely fine to play but these issues continually popping up is still pretty concerning.
---
Mods are pretty good about these things here.  I've reported a few posts that got removed pretty fast.
---
I used to joke about there being 1 active mod here, but I really don't think that's the case, at least not any more.
---
We already have responder, raider and free states and Moth an cult items in the shop, enclave ones are leaked and I think there enough BoS items through vanilla aswell. (I'm a big fan of BoS tho and won't be mad if they bring more ;)) Not fitting to our topic but I would like some kinda faction based pvp or some kind of faction war like in for Honor.
---
Dude I looked at the top 10 posts on hot. 6 of those are complaints lmfao. And those are all the highest upvoted. 
---
The inventory exploit is a huge huge huge bug and I don‚Äôt think I need any other context than knowing that some players legitimately got dicked and lost hours of their invested time and there is no way to directly fix that. The bug being patched doesn‚Äôt fix the problem.
---
Fucking hell Bethesda. I planned on taking over every workshop today to farm presents. Guess I'll go play Overwatch now.
---
Game companies tend to not give specifics until they are sure they can meet them
---
Just played for about an hour. Took 3 workshops and no gifts from santatrons. Point pleasant and Helvetia always guaranteed 2-3 Santa scorched and had non. Hopefully it was just a bogus server
---
I know that not everyone‚Äôs a fan of fallout 1st but at the very least it would be nice if they increase the budget for camp building in private worlds where we can build a town.
---
Xbox
---
Spotted this eventually thanks.
---
Yes it was added with gun runners 
---
Honestly is saddens me that fallout 76 damage isn't based on bullet calliber or at least somewhat like in NV, I mean they even removed 7.62 ammo from the game. Why?
---
I'm still seeing gift wrap on servers on PC at 3 PM central.
---
Xbox and no I have not seen anything for the last 5 hours, I mentioned this on the 76 Twitter page and Bethesda jumped on me and wanted me to submit a ticket
---
My recommendation is for you to try it yourself and form your *own* opinion.
---
This has been a bug for over a year now. Unfortunately no fix in sight
---
Moderation seems to have gotten  much better since the fallout first debacle. 
---
They are probably the  hardest working mods on reddit right now, and still trying to put out all the fires the haters are starting.
---
lol wow Bethesda
---
I heard a new code for the hack was released and that it is still possible to lose all your stuff so be careful and stick with the private servers if you can for now
---
I was all set to farm santa scorched.  Bethesda said nope :(
---
If it was green it was the rare Ultracite Gatling Laser, which is VERY powerful and does crazy DPS.
---
&gt; The inventory exploit is a huge huge huge bug and I don‚Äôt think I need any other context than knowing that some players legitimately got dicked and lost hours of their invested time and there is no way to directly fix that.
---
And fixed too, but facts dont matter to you. Some people are SOL, sure, but the problem that caused it is fixed. You made up your mind, so go away already.
---
I was ready to farm santa scorched.  :(
---
The year 2002 called and they want their joke back. Also to Bethesda: the year 2002 called and they want their engine back.
---
And he just jumps out the corner at you. 
---
Sneak+covert operative+vats crits+fixer does well against this cave
---
Good advice.  I enjoy the vending, trading and interactions it brings to base.  I need to remember to just get out there and explore more.
---
It is, otherwise there would be content, hence their attempts at promoting griefing, PvP and other engagements. But the wrong community had a higher say and now we ended up with a shadow of what it could‚Äôve been with events such as monster mash and the removal of others which should not have happened, like survival and the battle that never was (which never was).
---
Yup. Me too!
---
My normal basic turrets do a good job of killing the level 50 glowing mongrels that live out the back of my camp.
---
They also do a decent job against the golf club ghouls if someone runs to my camp for safety (it‚Äôs a decent hike but not too far).
---
That said there I had to put a few concrete half walls (fences) around my base in select places to stop the mongrels eating their way in through the walls...they seem attracted to fences first.
---
Yeah, I took over workshops today and realized that the Santa protection wasn‚Äôt dropping gifts.
---
Yes, they seemed to have screwed up the event timer for console players. This is effecting both PS4 and Xbox. Hopefully fixed soon but who knows with the holidays and vacations
---
No problemo. Thank's for not being a dick about it (as others have)!
---
I had read that too. Just wanted to hear it from an active member. Appreciate the info.
---
Karma for all the douchebag console users sarcastically spouting off "master race" comments in every thread during the hacking problems last week.
---
Read again, if you're capable.
---
PS4 and although only played about an hour no Santa scorched and no santatron gifts from 3 workshops. Didn‚Äôt try vendors so can‚Äôt confirm that. From reading some of the comments here and other posts seems like a console problem. Maybe this is Bethesda‚Äôs way of making up for the hacking fiasco. Or they simply screwed up. Either way I though I had a few more days and was looking to plow through some scorched this weekend to try and get the rest of the mount plans. Oh well guess I‚Äôll find players selling them for hopefully cheap caps.
---
There have been a couple of virtually complete new game updates since the beta.
---
Im still able to get the wrapping paper and stuff tho
---
Yeah just came to see what's up killed like 100 and nothing looked at their Instagram it said 31st and now it seems it not just me.
---
Generally speaking yes. I still think they have the date but are just waiting until everyone‚Äôs back from the holidays to announce it.
---
Survey says piss off
---
Seems like it was a temporary issue.
---
I was aware it was fixed when I posted. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it happened or the fact that people are SOL. 
---
That‚Äôs not a sure, whatever. That‚Äôs pretty indicative that I shouldn‚Äôt get into this game considering those players potentially lost 100s of hours of invested time without a fix giving them their inventories back. 
---
I will go away cus I‚Äôd rather not get involved in a community of toxic and rabid fanboys who don‚Äôt even care about each other much less new players trying to enter. Deuces m8
---
I don't think it's been changed but it used to be o be that if you scoped in on a SB while she's hovering over the field, you can see that 'area' plopping out Scorched and other goodies.  It's definitely an 'outtie hole', you eyes didn't deceive you.
---
Try turning off depth of field in the graphic options.
---
I was so disappointed when I realized it ended because I didn‚Äôt manage to get the plasma grenade plan! But then I found it in a vendor for 750 caps! I was thrilled (and really surprised).
---
i wouldn't go too deep, figure out what suits you... melee, gun, heavy gun, pa melee, pa heavy gun, stealth, look through some builds. Some require mutations, which you would need luck to keep the mutations *they come later in levels though* i would say 3 for Pharma Farma is good, if nothing else. And just remember whenever you hit a box, hit that space bar. It might take it a few secs to pop, but when you hear that chime its like your birthday. I regret not wiping my main toon, just because i have learned so much since playing her... but im attached. I do have alts though that I go through like candy, trying different things, different farming methods. Good luck, have fun and take your time. :) It can be a fun game, as long as you don't rush it.
---
Googling the game size only shoes 50 GBs though?
---
It‚Äôs like people feeding EA on there crappy games. But on the other hands karma against Bethesda is well deserved
---
I have a camp near Flatwoods and my Heavy Machinegun Turrets (the second tier ones) can't even kill a level 1 Mr Farmhand. They miss every shot until the Farmhand destroys it.
---
VATS heavy build is a must if you‚Äôre not that great at normal gunplay.
---
I‚Äôm good at normal gunplay but VATS is so much easier.
---
I stealth sniper or commando is probably the easiest introduction to the game as you have less chance of being killed.
---
So high agility, high perception, and high luck, for VATS stealth builds.
---
Alternatively.  Pick up a mini gun, get in some power armour and fire away.
---
FFS. Was looking forward to a weekend of scorch slaying. Would it be possible for them not to screw something up. I know,  rhetorical question.
---
What time zone are you in? I'll probably be headed home soon and can guide you through a standard run. I'll add you when I get home and see what's up. In game: greywhispers.
---
The beta files and the game files are different for some reason. When I got the game I had both the full game and the beta game downloaded. The beta did nothing even with the full game installed
---
Nah man, I think I‚Äôm good on that. Based on the fact the majority of commenters on this post were so negative and automatically assumed I was a troll for pointing out the top posts on the sub rather than trying to give a legitimate opinion.
---
combat engineer sounds interesting, i have a rifleman/cowboy type, but I only need certain bullets and scrounger doesnt really give me the bullets i need.
---
I'm on Xbox and the last time there was a big update it was in the region of 70 gigs. Hopefully you get it working :)
---
I spend just over an hour and nothing
---
So they were able to patch the hack so players could no longer steal from another player's inventory. It's not completely fixed because you can still put things in other people's inventories using the same hack.
---
Can‚Äôt miss with good material...ü§™
---
My camp has a massive load of enemy‚Äôs spawn as soon as I load in and they wipe them out but my buds have problems with them being shot at from far away
---
Call Beth and explain the ‚Äúanykey‚Äùconundrum to them üòÇü§£
---
Oh alright thanks for the info!
---
Get the perk fireproof in endurance it will help a lot with explosions, grenades and scorchbeast attacks
---
There's a bunch of posts that say that the files wouldn't be different but i'll take your word for it, thanks for the help!
---
That's terrible advice.  Even before the Scaro Box was released, everyone knew that most junk should NOT be bulked.  Only Aluminum and Lead benefited in the days of storing Junk in the Stash box.  Everything else is wasting valuable plastic.  If you have the FO First Scrapbox, then there's no need to bulk at all.
---
Additionally, in the tweet they did not specify any system, just that they were extending the event. I'm sorry you were down voted, I did not understand exactly what you meant at first.
---
Yes it was brutal but having played fallout 4 before I thought he was an enemy! I felt very sorry for the player but also thankful that he didn't take revenge on me poor newby üòÇ
---
The thing I hate the most is that the defenses are not on if you're not there so if a random monster is up there it can attack without the turrets doing anything
---
It's a TRAP!!
---
I still have both on my xbox. But idk
---
Ok so while you can‚Äôt lose all your stuff you could have a tonne of duped items dumped in your stash and get Todd‚Äôs mighty banhammer (which is what Im gonna call my 3* bloodied super sledge when I find it finally) for having them
---
I have been here since the beta, Sure my places get attacked but a couple of cheap ass turrets take care of the low level threats.
---
 My CAMP up North I just took down, suffered zero damage in the three weeks it was there. Low level Muties were the worst visitor and they just died. 
---
 My high level in the Mire barely notices the attacks from the locals and wandering Muties etc. Fences and his corn on one side gets trashed. The rest suffers minimal damage.
---
 I have never felt the need to take Defence Perks, and who has extra?
---
It‚Äôs because of the endless abuse many of us have received for simply enjoying the game, *despite* it‚Äôs issues. Whether you realized it or not,  you came across trollish in your original post. I don‚Äôt think we trusted your intentions at the beginning. But again, why go off anyone‚Äôs opinion? Try the game yourself. Make up your own mind. There was free trial just a week ago. Too bad you missed it.
---
We‚Äôve been hacked!
---
"Only use 1st to criticize on 76". I'm sorry what? The majority of criticisms this game gets is much more then just the 1st subscription. By the sound of your comment it makes it seem as though there is no legitimate criticism besides the 1st subscription, which is just untrue.
---
I agree, since its only yourself and your friends you have to worry about, you wontbbe lagging ut random peoples games
---
I agree tbh.
---
If you do novice on solo you should get similiar rewards to the next difficulty level up to a person in a team of 4.
---
It needs to scale based on more than the difficulty level of the raid, but the size of the team as well.
---
I'm on PC.  I just bought papers from all the vendors at WS, and my Santa is still bringing gifts as of this writing.
---
I'm a fairly newb gamer, but my impression is that PC gamers are considered superior to us lowly console folks generally... so you wouldn't have caught me making that kind of comment!
---
Merry Christmas, I appreciate your post. I will always have a love for fallout 76. It's literally fallout with the boys. who cares about no npc's. its all about the experience.
---
The game isnt so good... I bought the game on his lunch and played it for a month. The content wasnt so good but if u rly need a new game it will give you that 30h (difficult to find a game that gives a 30h of gameplay)
---
I think as soon as they got rid of the whole top three on the map get highlighted thing survival was perfect. Only other tweak would have been a pacifist mode a la GTA to avoid the train station issues. 
---
Survival had gone by the time I hit the PC version but I liked it on XB1 after the changes. I think no camp flags no player flags either on map or HUD at any time, a choice for pacifist mode, no fast travel and harder enemies. 
---
I‚Äôd love a no fast travel version, I‚Äôve stopped doing it for a bit and the game is completely different.
---
I loved survival in FO4. If I was going for a quest I‚Äôd have to stock ADA with enough supplies to Last the journey and fusion cores/ammo. It made random encounters awesome.
---
If you to novice you have all the time in the world to complete an event that is ONLY difficult because of the reduced time you get in the harder modes. This is not comparable at all to each other in the least.
---
Your amazing... I just jumped up like a crazy person. Because he didn't get it when it first came out, not sure if that has anything to do with this or if he just  not gotten that close. He's good and I've seen her beat a lot. Like I said though, I'm usually just watching the screen, watching things behind him and around him lol.... Thank you, sounds silly but, I feel a lot better.....
---
I came to say this. Why is OC surprised at getting shitty shit?
---
It's weird as the Elder Scrolls Online holiday event lasts until the 2nd of January!
---
It is a hoard event the appear randomly throughout the map. It is not a daily event of a side event it gives you a three Star legendary cricket as the boss.
---
Any time I go into a new area/on a new quest in a tough area, I always stop and look at the menu to see if there are high level players in the vicinity. If so, I don't even bother and put it off until later when the area is clear- because I know that given Murphy's Law, I'm about to get one-shotted by some random high level ghoul that spawns in. :D
---
If you're on PC, add me to your Friends List.  My name in game is Coxinga.  I will craft you a full set or armor, some new weapons, and help you get a power armor chassis and some starter pieces.  I can also teach you about the mechanics of the game, or help you figure out a playstyle you're comfortable with.
---
Appears to be a console thing, almost everyone on consoles is saying they're gone (with a PS4 exception or two), but everyone on PC is reporting it's still all active.
---
Clever, creative, I like it!
---
Get in line, my friend.
---
And you can watch reviews on the game... But the newest one are the honest one... The game didnt got love on the first 3 months... Being honest with you he dosnt get love at all... bethesda fuc* us up here
---
But they added paddle ball. Surely that makes up for it lol!!
---
Would say I agree but it‚Äôs outlasted PUBG, and it‚Äôs popularity is at such a point especially with kids that parents took to mass hysteria when the black hole event happened. 
---
I don‚Äôt get on with fortnite never could probably never will but as a game it‚Äôs done well and hits its niche perfectly. 
---
And their marketing is pretty spot on if not borderline suspect üòÖ
---
It hasn't been extended on Xbox either but PC players have confirmed they are still getting Santa scorched and gifts from santa and are able to buy wrapping paper.
---
See what you did there
---
Yes, there are more things you can get then you can use all at once in your camp.  There has to be a limit to how much you can put out.
---
Reading other posts Xbox is also having the same issue. PC seems to be ok. I have PS4 so I‚Äôm just relaying what I‚Äôve read.
---
So... first off, where are you coming from, and secondly. I started by saying that the game had flaws. What im saying is that using only Fallout 1st to hate on that game only means that you dont know what youre talking about.
---
I dont get it
---
Now there‚Äôs 2 the more the better
---
Ok, kiddo, answer my 3 questions and I'll answer yours (it's been 2 days and you can't answer me directly, so I'll be kind and assume your busy, and not an idiot).
---
1. Where did I advocate Fallout 76 in this thread?
---
2. Where did I deny Bethesda's faults in this thread?
---
3. Are you still crying?
---
No but the legendarys were nice
---
I didn‚Äôt get it either until I found it in a vendor for 150. Some people must have just got a bunch to let them go for cheap
---
Except there's not because the mods are removing duplicates.
---
Hey, thank you again SO much for not only handing over your Blade (for free!) but then dropping ALLLLLLL that amazing loot for me. It was totally unexpected, and very much appreciated.  If there's ever anything I can help you out with in game, let me know!  Hope I see you around the wasteland sometime, and I'll force you to take that photo with me... :D
---
This is pretty obvious, but it still mainly depends on your internet. The private server helps regardless, but the main cause of lag, for me at least, is internet connection. When I play at home on private servers, I have absolutely zero lag, but when I play at my girlfriend's house, on slower internet, I get stutters and lag spikes even in a private server, since it's still an online game.
---
This is why I believe ammo is losing value as a currency. With scrap being able to be stored infinitely and weightless, clans or tight knit groups can pool into one scrap box with only 1 player paying for fo1st. Speculation of course, but I myself carry so much ammo on my main that it is becoming my biggest hiderance as far as weight goes, even with bandier, ordinance express, and batteries included.
---
The first words were 
---
"As a player i didnt like it,the game wasnt ready for the world... But if you really want to you can buy it, its your money. (The first was the other half)
---
The battle that never was, was removed because it was glitchy af
---
I've been on for over 5 hours, I have multiple Santatrons running, and I've not seen a single gift. No holiday scorched have appeared either.
---
Yes I agree but atleast Make the limit a bit higher?
---
It's full of vital nutrients.
---
I was the second to post about it
---
how tall is she and how long can she last
---
It a thinker....
---
&gt; I do know that when heart of the swamp pops you have a good chance to grab the blooms but have even seen them bloom when it‚Äôs not
---
Heart of the Swamp itself doesn't do anything. Many times I've gone hunting while it's on to no effect. Even at one point thinking it's "site" dependent.
---
Verdant Season is currently at 100% trigger, BUT on a small (Very Small) sample size.
---
I Just don't get why mobs feel the need to attack inanimate objects in the first place.. I get that it's a "survival aspect" but c'mon. I can sorta understand molerats and such attacking things that make sounds (like Tremors/graboids)...but not super mutants and robots attacking the walls or your couch..
---
On PS4 also and nothing.
---
I found two at a farm the other day!  I was so tempted to grab them and out them into display cases at my camp, with lit letters and arrow signs pointing "Dirty Ho's Inside!" 
---
But my better judgement and sensible adult mind got the better of me...
---
I have only noticed heart of the swamp not have them bloom once in my experience that‚Äôs why I think it has to do this night time in game more then events. I never knew verdant season helped at all. Do you go to the event itself or back to that river next to the dyer factory?
---
Got lots of santa scorched all day today and wrapping paper on every vendor thus far ...
---
Something like this:  [https://nukesdragons.com/](https://nukesdragons.com/)  ?
---
*hits escape*
---
No, don't add deadlines and stress to Dev team, let them get it done right.
---
Console
---
Bethesda messed up &amp; ended it early for console players....
---
A really good way to circumvent that problem is to just not buy more shit for your Pretty Princess Dress Up Wasteland Castle.
---
Easier said than done lol the temptation will always be there
---
Read what? You know shit works better as fertilizer, not facts?
---
Speaking of facts:
---
Where did I advocate for 76 in this thread? I don't think I did.
---
Where did I defend Bethesda? Nope, another blank.
---
But shhh, don't worry. I still love you.
---
She has 75 percent damage resistance to explosives.
---
Another post said they scrapped and rebuilt theirs and it started giving again.
---
I‚Äôve been seeing A LOT less Santa‚Äôs within the past few days
---
Someone pissed in your cornflakes this morning? ü§î
---
Yeah, thanks, this is a lot more compact than the other one I had :)
---
And on PC?
---
Out of 100(ish) various plans, I still have multiples of everything but the donut and hanging ribbons. I still have 5 berets on my mule.
---
Did daddy tell you to delete that other comment?  Awww poor baby.  If someone does not criticise an obviously flawed product or service, then they are advocating and furthet encouraging its bad practices.  End of story.
---
Or they're like me and don't know what stuff goes for so they just put a price to get it gone. Any plans ive gotten from the event I've put in my vender for 75caps. The only exception was a mounted mothman, which I sold for 2k, about 20 minutes later I saw them going for 5-8k on the trade sub
---
I would agree except that we were already told that the goal date for Wastelanders was this past November, now not only is it delayed but all we get is a 3 months window when they might be releasing it. I'm not saying give us a date but I would love to at the very least know what month it's coming out. This close to roll out it should be easy to give a 30 day time frame. Other game companies give the release month half a year before launch fairly often.
---
And this is why my main has a camp where it's never attacked.
---
I guess I should have specified, I used the small rectangular rug not the round flowery one.
---
Most of the responses I've seen say PC players weren't effected...I'm on PS4 &amp; the event seems over for me. No presents, Santa's, or wrapping papers.
---
A friend of mine who is a serious trader told me his friend demonstrated on him today the hack still works so to me it would be unwise to just ignore his warnings.
---
It‚Äôs working on PC
---
umm ya stealth and hiding is part of the game, hopping around like jack rabbits out in the open is the most stupid thing ever and no skill to it at all. There is no stealth because I have seen animals flat out ignore player hopping around like tards and go for the person hiding, sometimes the game even spawns them next to you. I was playing today and planted a mine by a entrance hole in the wall in Morgantown. I could hear the other team approach. The game spawns a bloater fly right in  front of me for no reason giving away my position and chance to kill them. They however had no skill or plan and just came in and shot me. No skill involved to win. But hey they jump around a lot. Also should not be multiple spawns, I killed the Grafton monster twice in a game. How dumb is that. They spawned him a second time on a random cliff where I was, of course they did not spawn him next to the whole team of 4 above me who again with no skill easily spotted me then as I had to defend myself. There is no skill involved for most of the winners. Hell I even won a game once and did not have to kill anyone. Now that took skill.
---
Do people buy the plan and resell or actually craft the grenades? I ate the plan when i got it but regretted it immediately, since I always have too many grenades and end up unloading them to vendor bots all the time üò≠
---
Hard Crash!
---
I was able to find paper and get present from the Santa-Troy this morning around 11am central, but saw NO holiday scorched
---
I made use of those ones for moving the Water Purifier, hadn't yet succeeded getting any plants on those yet though. Good to hear that it still works!
---
I had a team not 3 hours ago, have a go at me for shooting at her while in the air. 
---
"claiming" that she is less likely to land. Which outside a potential staggering issue, goes against everything I've heard.
---
My camp has had zero turrets and zero defensive items for months. My camp  rarely gets attacked. Those that do attack it meet a swift end by my pet deathclaw. I also live in Forest region, so worst enemy I get is a couple level 5 muties, small horde of level 3 mongrels, level 1 ghouls or level 1-6 scorched....All of which are no issue for Angel.
---
Recently though, since putting down my Santatron, I've noticed an increase in mole rats recently. They only go for the Santatron, as they spawn right beside it. .I also noticed the odd mole rat attacking my camp(Sometimes 6+ in a row, after killing each one), the second I put down generators....like, I don't even have time to exit build mode before they were attacking them, so I've hidden my generators inside my roof and it's been a non issue since.
---
IMO, for defensive purposes, the only worthy pets are a deathclaw or megasloth....I've had my deathclaw for over 4 months and have had no issues, aside from randos shooting at her (which is a non issue, since I'm in pacifist mode, so she can't be harmed by players).
---
No gift wrap on XB1 tried 5 servers so far
---
You all should play FROM Software games because you all love being punished.
---
umm no the animals don't kill me so its not on me but it is on the developers that it gives away my position. I should be able to play fairly the way I want. Not with the game constantly spawning animals out of the thin blue air next to me. I had the grafton monster spawn on a cliff where I was and not above where the other team was of four sitting comfortably. Stealth is supposed to be part of the game too so let it be and stop screwing players over.
---
Yeah but they should just be dirt floor pieces this time so you can snap them or planters
---
Not broken on PS4, broken everywhere instead. Haven't ran into one either for last few hours.
---
Tbh a lot of it is preference and experience. Some perks are good for all builds, some perks are situational, some builds rely heavily on specific perks. It'd be easier to let people know your playstyle and ask for a direction to go. Some people like to go for full damage output while others like myself go for the most versatility in a build. I have a heavy gunner build which is also my main crafter. I have a stealth rifleman. And I also have a berserker just for fun. Each has a niche set of perks but each are also very flexible when swapping perks. Heavy gunner is a support class and team often so he has a lot of team oriented perks and mutations. Rifle guy is solo most of the time so solo perks as well as lockpick and other utility perks. Zerker is just a weird class and very hard to manage, not recommended for beginners.
---
Look bro this is not like you‚Äôre investing in a company for retirement, it literally only cost less than a meal for two. Give it a go and see for yourself, no need for endless thinking and rethinking imho.
---
That's fine. Another event stopped before the end date. I'm sure their way of fixing it will be adding a weekend of the event sometime around the next holiday. I'm sure they'll be an Easter event. Can't wait to get Christmas presents in April.
---
Lol, nah man, it's not like that. I definitely prefer PC but the platform you play games on doesn't make you better or worse than anyone else. And the vast majority of PC gamers who talk about the PC master race thing are doing it with their tongues planted firmly in cheek.
---
Regardless of how you play games, we're still talking about games here. No one should take it too seriously.
---
that's not a bad idea, I hate crossbows but ya they might be good for the smaller animals like dogs and such. I mainly don't take them because of weight and I horde a lot of weapons so I have options. I love the shotguns inside tight areas in buildings. Works well as it should for that. I also take cores from power armor so nobody can use them..lol...just to be a dick. Atleast until they kill me and find the armor suit again I took them from.
---
I appreciated him saying don't give them ideas for this exact reason.. lol (and yeah wouldn't surprise me either.)
---
Console?  Probably bugged, seems OK on PC but not on consoles.
---
I'll offer 100 caps for the night........... hehehe
---
Some players just price stuff decently all the time, seeing no reason to gouge other players that struggle with RNG frustration.
---
They won't even if they are given a full year to develop it. This is Bethesda.
---
Serious question: If I had no knowledge of 76, would I advocating it?
---
But, thanks for the answer, I appreciate it.
---
Means an actual discussion can now be had, if you still want one?
---
Or, passive-aggresive insults are fun too.
---
Personally I have never seen her stagger from shots anywhere but her head. Crippling her wings forces her to land and you can visually see her rear her head back from head shots so to me there is not enough evidence to justify that any shots to her body would keep her from landing. I would need to see this for myself. There are perk cards that give the chance to stagger in the description so that would make sense but you have to assume the player has them equipped.
---
Bethesda messed up &amp; ended event early on console.....üòî
---
All I wanted was that damned Wendigo. I thought I had more time :'(
---
Where's my Tab?
---
You got an up vote from me +karma
---
I just checked literally a few minutes ago, [screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/f4Khbpa)  was taken at 4:57pm EST at Charleston Station
---
It wasn't just a high chance for limb damage; *all melee weapons* were dropping with it, plus only agility or reduced weight for the third star. They quickly pulled the bugged version, and it's been patched for the current mystery pick.
---
Yeah... If you wanna remove all ure clothes just wait a cheater and he will do it for you free
---
Damn I thought they did fix this, social menu has actually been working for me lately
---
I did the same. I've been running from Santatron to Santatron and picking up coal and shit. Thanks, Bethesda.
---
Yes with my dense chest I take basically 0 damage from explosions and SB screams
---
Agreed! The thing that I think of is from fonv where you could craft the gecko armor, you need gecko skin to make it.
---
No, you‚Äôre the only one struggling with CAMP budget
---
This response right here..is joyous.
---
Also, deal.
---
Saddly it remains as effective as .38 special so maybe
---
Well then, she can say hello to my Zealot‚Äôs FFR Primed Auto Handmade....
---
Relog, it's back for me on XB
---
If you want a tab, son, you have to order somthing!
---
Awesome thabk you
---
Wait, you can adult on this game?
---
Sweet thanks
---
I just hit my first holiday gift now. maybe they flipped a switch. I have no idea how this stuff works. but now at 4:02 central time, I've received my first gift.
---
On console, relog. All of the wrap and scorched are back after I reloaded the game.
---
Consoles fucked, sorry mate.
---
Ok, thanks!
---
I killed two Santa scorched on Xbox One this morning. When did the cut-off happen?
---
38 inches, should last awhile as long as you keep her out of the rain and clean her handle every so often.
---
I saw a level 1017 at Westek a few weeks ago.
---
I'm on PS4. I loaded up my lvl 155, hopped a couple servers, no Santa Scorched, no wrapping paper, no Santatron gifts. Switched over to a lvl 3 alt that I just made a couple days ago, ran into Grahm next to Overseer's Camp. He's selling wrapping paper. Haven't gone to a scorched location yet, since I've only discovered a few places. Doesn't make sense.
---
What a surprise, Bethesda screwing up again.
---
While testing Heart of the swamp I went to various locations, none were consistent and only Dyer spawned at all.
---
On my Verdant Season tests, Dyer has spawned every time. But as mentioned, sample size is small. Other locations have not spawned.
---
So, at the moment, the only that appears to work each time is Dyer, during Verdant season.  
---
In regards to night time. that is also no true, I have seen videos and also experienced it myself that they can spawn during daylight (again, no event present)
---
Yes. It's also fun to see someone get in, takena few slow steps, het out, and die before they know I was watching them.
---
I quit using camp defenses in January, you should give it a try
---
If you're on XB1 I'll sell you the icicle lights np
---
Facts are only called "shit" by fanboys.  Thought you were being real smart there didn't ya mate.   See my previous reply for the answers to your two questions.  I must say, for someone who was so bored with me, you seem to be commenting quite a bit.  That doesn't make me a troll.  That means you truly believe in your stance, and that is strangely admirable.  It's just a pity your stance is the result of corporate brainwashing.
---
 If areas have more enemies spawns, then defenses should counter them. It is a fault of the game design, not the fault of player.
---
I think the Scorched event really hurt ammo by creating a cap sink and basically removing a lot of the stored caps from the game across all systems.  After the first day I saw many people trying to sell their 5.56 for less than 1:1 cap ratio.  (Meaning 10k 5.56 for 8k Caps). Before the event no one wanted caps...now most don‚Äôt want the ammo lol.
---
Wendigo is from an in game quest.  Read a CH monthly where you find boomer as I recall to start it.
---
I sell it for 10 caps per seems to sell well at that rate
---
It is safe currently. Anyone saying otherwise is fear mongering
---
Same issue on Xbox.  So much for farming gifts
---
You are just not a big fan of explosives. I can never have enough. And with the right parks it doesn't way much at all.
---
Shhh!   it's a secret!
---
This is an argument that blames the player and ignores the fact that defenses simply don't work.
---
On this they should make it hourly like mischief night and not random.
---
If I see punji boards at a camp I'm taking everything I can from that camp
---
PC or console?
---
you cant spawn the event by yourself anymore. you have to wait until it pops up on your server (you'll get a notification)
---
Oh god it doesnt sound like fun that the challenges are the fastest way they will take forever
---
But ty
---
Exactly! And it would add more incentive for people contemplating getting Fallout 1st.
---
If i was low and had the caps, I'd buy at that value.
---
I could easily see a big outcry from it though which is the only downside
---
500 caps
---
Yeah that  sounds very typical.
---
And here I thought we were making progress...
---
Until now, you've only called me a fan boy, without saying why, and I called you a troll for shitposting.
---
So, again, you want a discussion or an insult match?
---
Only if meat week was going on
---
 you want them both
---
Facts
---
I noticed this as well from a long break. Let me know if you find a solution.
---
Turrets still depend on cards but defense is still a joke my turrets don't even attack until I do most of the time and I still have the dome turrets or ceiling mounted tesla traps
---
Take the core and leave a mine hehe
---
Both? I find rank 3 of fireproof is more than enough for pve so if dense chest is equal to that then i think im good with one or the other
---
How would I get it?
---
it just turned back on for me on xbox.  Just fyi.
---
The incompetence Bethesda has displayed since the launch of this game is staggering both in terms of quality and quantity. Big fuck ups, little fuck ups, all fuck ups in between. This is on the smaller end but still a fuck up.
---
Right....
---
yeah the challenges are very "grindy" and take some time but they are doable. i got my backpack mod exclusively from doing the challenges since the event was bugged at the time and didn't award any badges at all. just do the event whenever you see it and you should be fine
---
Not only that, they've already been caught doing shilly shit like that. Don't forget the 5 star reviews they had on their nukadark rum before it even released. Then once called out they all disappeared.
---
Xbox here.  
---
I have ran into Santa scorched, but low lv. At least the presents aren't lv based(till opening).
---
I seen little amounts of wrapping paper in vendors, but not a lot.
---
I have never received a gift in my collector bot.
---
Power armor is  pretty good for PVE at least.  Not great for PVP but power armor does a good enough job  against super mutants, scorched etc.  My missile turrets completely ignore super mutants and barely put a dent in most low level enemies. Camp defenses in PVE suck even worse than power armor in PVP.
---
You cannot trigger it. Gotta wait for it to appear.
---
good to hear it's good for you though
---
I ordered an RC, not a Tab, nobody wants that diet soda crap.
---
I finally got another present out of santatron. Had nothing for hours before that. XB1
---
Actually had someone at work ask this in all seriousness...
---
You get that from the Sunken Church I think it's called. Gotta go down the rabbit hole to the end where you fight the Wendigo and you get the plans.
---
They're still your crops! Kill them all!
---
It‚Äôs fixed. At least on PS4
---
when i started playing, the game was using the integrated intel-hd graphics instead of the dedicated graphics card. Other than that i have no idea, your specs are more than enough to run the game
---
Dude the entire legendary system needs to be taken down to the studs and refurbished. We're still living in Bethesda's failed in-game economy, where god level stuff was supposed to be incredibly rare. Things like nocturnal were supposed to serve as useful tools to bridge to when you get something better. Thanks to an inability to keep a lid on duping however, the god roll stuff is much, much easier to get and lesser prefixes have almost no value except as scrip. 
---
If it were up to be, it wouldn't ever be in the game.
---
I do this too
---
Don't think they did, I'm still getting scorched. Wonder how dumb rumors like this get started lol. I even uploaded a vid to youtube about it
---
I can confirm legendary scorched at least from a private server
---
Not sure why you‚Äôre spreading misinformation. It‚Äôs fixed now btw, at least on PS4
---
Woot woot!
---
Mmmmmm RrrrrrCcccc Colaaaaa ü§§
---
The assholr thing is to abuse an exploit to make people miserable. Just cause the company made it easy to do so doesn‚Äôt mean people should do so or excuse them for doing so.
---
I like that because it encourages PVP. Feel free to pick my locks, just don‚Äôt be surprised if i kill ya
---
Bethesda fucked something up? What are the chances?!?!?

I stated a fact, if you want to append fake shit and inaccurate intentions to my statement, that is on you. Try not using defenses, you will be okay.
---
You selling? What platform?
---
Actually, there are no known active Adventure mode exploits on the PC at the present time. So we're back to business as normal so to speak.
---
I just picked up a small gift from the santatron ps4 UK. Haven't had one in a couple of hours but one dropped. No Christmas scorch though. Maybe still a chance of a mega Slough head...
---
How do you get plans with gift wrap?
---
PC is way more fucked than console ever will be though my guy
---
If I do, its in my vendor, and wont be accessible till I get home from work in 4 hours.
---
XB1
---
You are welcome to stop by tonight to check.
---
do the cores actually weigh anything in NW..i dont remember
---
Ctrl-alt-delete?
---
How were you going to farm presents, if you dont mind sharing?
---
I‚Äôll stop by and check it out.
---
I prefer pneumatic chest, what with the new 5+ second back to back staggers available out in the wild. I use Fireproof 2 or 3 on my characters. What endurance perks are you wanting to use otherwise out of curiosity?
---
Yeah I really would have preferred dropping all the magic bullshit and really putting an emphasis on crafting. You'd still be in a loot grind but it would be a lot more satisfying than what we've got
---
I just logged on (PS4) and all the vendors  have holiday paper. Seems fine.
---
 Sure it is. I like the CAMPs on the edge of the Nuke Zone near Watoga and some of them are seriously dangerous. Good design.
---
 I put mine where I don't have to defend it much as I have no need for one that is producing much at all. I just build mine in nice places and take Workshops for my materials.
---
 Its not the game design, the place is supposed to be dangerous. If you choose to build where its especially dangerous you are gonna take serious attacks. As I said the Nuke Zone CAMPs seem to survive just fine, what are you doing wrong?
---
I can't see any other posts with this info yet
---
Eh because it's dead and gone. Unfortunate, because some of my favorite times were playing in Survival servers. I'm no PvP ace but the thrill of possibly being attacked at any moment was amazing
---
No, so I always just hold onto them for the whole round
---
What for real after the update?(I'm assuming there was an update today already at work sorry.)
---
Take over every workshop on a private server and plop down a santatron at each one. I only had 4 workshops going a few days ago and had over 100 presents in about 6 hours.
---
So they took the wrapping paper away damn it I knew I should have started buying earlier...
---
this has recently been happening to me, and yes I played NW first. 
---
I have been workign to get the christmas rewards. happenes quite frequently now. 
---
Stinks because I also spent atoms during these rewardsa dn atom shop purchases :( 
---
maybe I will try a ticket
---
Nice.  Did you have to defend the santatron?
---
Ok so is wrapping paper coming back to vendors or is it gone forever?
---
If I don‚Äôt open these gifts will they disappear from my inventory?
---
If I found more than one I would have grabbed them to sell. But I didn‚Äôt have it yet so I used it. I try to get any plans I don‚Äôt currently have
---
I dont find that staggers bother me much with my build but i will consider that, thank you. My plan was to move the points out of endurance into something more useful bit I'm not sure where yet. Since you can't have any star at 0, I'll prob leave rank 1 fireproof on
---
I stopped using defences.  Too much budget.  No real purpose.
---
Easy to fix my CAMP.   Mobs never destroy more than a couple things if you place your CAMP away from high traffic locations (once players leave an area, the mobs disappear - they are instanced to the players active in an area).
---
Eliminates frustration.  Enough of that (frustration) with the RNG systems of the game.
---
I can't fine holiday scorched anywhere today....on xbox.
---
Yeah can confirm on PS4 as well barbatron are back to give gift and just found a couple around
---
I thought I had read that they were completely broken. I‚Äôd like more info too.
---
I was super hoping one of the vault raids was just going to be endless swarms of glowing ones attacking the party that dared the entrance, but no...
---
Someone said their wrapping paper disappeared from their inventory. Does anyone know if the gifts will disappear from inventory after the event? I‚Äôve been holding onto mine.
---
The most optimistic outcome will be that players who submit a ticket successfully stand a chance for some form of remediation. BGS has not shared what that compensation will be. To the best of my knowledge they have not commuted to restoring any player owned equipment that may or may not have been stolen. One thing is fairly certain, no ticket means no service.
---
&gt;  Too much budget. No real purpose.
---
Which is the fault of the game design, not the people building them.
---
All good.  Hold up just a sec though, you're getting slightly ahead of yourself.  Having no knowledge of something is everyone's starting point.  Moving forward from that point, it's never been easier to make an informed decision about whether a product or service is good or whether it's simply companies screwing consumers with no lube.  So the information is definitely out there.  To that end, and given that FO76 has been out for a while now, people should at least have an understanding of its status and the kind of path it has taken.  In the case of FO76, it's been never-ending controversy and it's all been the result of Bethesda themselves.  Calling out Bethesda is the only way to try and stop this from happening again.  Honestly, I am here for the future benefit of whomever plays Bethesda releases.  How people interpret my posts and comments...I can't control that.
---
You're playing 76, what did you expect?
---
This would be really lore breaking. It is bad enough that the gamma gun and radium rifle are in the game.
---
I never had issues with it getting destroyed, I put up a bunch of turrets around it and if I had a defense I just waited until it was taken over, so when I did the event to retake the workshop I only had to deal with one wave of enemies. Sometimes I didn't even retake it, just collected and left again. The Santatron itself might even be invulnerable, I haven't seen a health bar for it, just the camp object.
---
I remember long ago, I had thought of a build that was strength heavy, and would let me do melee, power armor, shotguns, or heavy weapons as I  chose.  Is that still good?
---
Not necessarily. People who didn't submit tickets about losing just still got compensation if they did actually lose junk. A rollback of those players to right before it happened or as close to that as they can would be the best bet.
---
Fair enough, but don't be surprised if you get killed trying
---
No update. I've been private server all day and they just stopped working from about 12-5.  Working again now.
---
I get the feeling that even if you told the truth in a nice way they still would have downvoted the shit outta you.
---
You are not wrong though.
---
I know. I wrote the same post yesterday saying even though it's lore breaking it would be cool. Got down voted to hell, so I made a new one.

Where i'm coming from is that you are trying to downplay criticism, by making it sound like a large majority of criticism directed towards 76 is mainly due to fallout 1st, which is just incorrect. The game has been criticized sense its release a year ago and fallout 1st is just another check on the list. I'd also like to say, i'm not trying to tell you to not like the game.
---
It absolutely matters and should continue to matter.
---
When i posted this, everyone was hating on the game because of fallout 1st. Also i never said you tried to push me into not liking the game.
---
I tried to play fallout 4 again and man it just feels dead to me without other people.
---
Either fallout 76 needs to last forever or they pur at least small part multiplayer in every game or its going to just feel dead to me.
---
Yeah that's correct about manual blueprinting. I must have never done it manually I so I didn't know it doesn't work the same.
---
Was I also incorrect about storing being the only way to shut off a machine? I think that part was right. You can shut the vendor icon off but the machines still work don't they?
---
Only Bethesda (and my drunk uncle) could fuck up Christmas.
---
Can confirm! SantaTron just started collecting gifts!
---
Considering they are selling real freestates gear in their merch shop I am pretty sure it is here to stay.
---
First off, let's not throw around bigoted terms. There are a lot of people who are not as mentally capable with legitimate medical conditions. You can talk like an adult and avoid risking being banned for hate speech. I suspect you're more likely to double down on your use of bigoted terms, but I just thought I'd throw it out there for you.
---
I'll say it again: most players in this game do not understand how stealth works. A lot of people have theories and guesses about how it works, but they can never get their theories to work. The stealth mechanic has already been datamined, but people continue to cling to false beliefs. You know how you can tell if a theory is wrong? By testing it and not being able to repeat it consistently.
---
There is VERY little stealth in Nuclear Winter, that much is true. However, I routinely use the NW Scorchbeast to find enemies for me by using my understanding of stealth mechanics to make myself invisible to the Scorchbeast. Some people speculate that the SB goes after the highest level player; that is incorrect. Some people speculate that the SB goes after the player with the highest kill count; that is incorrect. The SB goes after the most VISIBLE player in its immediate vicinity. Visibility is determined by the use or lack of use of the stealth mechanics.
---
If the Scorchbeast can't see me, it goes after a player that it can see. If the Scorchbeast can't see anyone, it goes after other NPCs or it will endlessly circle the skies until it can see something. If the Scorchbeast attacks another player, great. I know exactly where to get my next kill. If the Scorchbeast attacks an NPC or doesn't attack at all, that's also great. It means that other players are equally invisible. I either need to encourage the other players to abandon their stealth or just find them the hard way. Either way, the Scorchbeast gives me data that I can use to my advantage.
---
The same is true with other NPCs. Most of the top players in the game watch the NPCs for clues about other players. If a Radscorpion suddenly tenses up, it has briefly spotted either another NPC or a player. If it then relaxes, it has "lost track" of the NPC or other player. However, if it starts running to attack, I can follow its path to see what it's attacking. Often, it's a player hiding in a bush who didn't realize that something as small as rotating 30 degrees to either direction is enough to alert every human and NPC enemy in the area.
---
Regarding enemy spawns, yes. As the player count in a server decreases, NPC spawns increasingly target players. NPCs WILL spawn on top of you, regardless of how invisible you are. I've played a couple of rounds where I was running through the fire, picking off human enemies, only to have NPCs spawn as far as 30 feet into the fire with me. This is 100% consistent with the concept of Battle Royale - the point of the game isn't to sit in a bush for as long as you can. Both the ring of fire and the NPCs exist with the primary purpose of preventing camping. Their intent is to push players closer and closer, until only 1 team survives. The reason it's so upsetting to you is that you are trying to use a gameplay style (bush camping) in a game mode that is incompatible with bush camping. The game wants you to MOVE, and you are trying to STAY. Staying in place is essentially 1 step above running into the fire at the start of each round. Obviously, the game makes running into the fire pointless. Some people don't get the hint about bush camping though. That's partially Bethesda's fault for the way they award XP based on survival longevity.
---
Regarding "no skill" players who jump around a lot. You're sort of right. Jumping around a lot SHOULDN'T help anyone. After all, moving UP and DOWN is no more effective than moving LEFT and RIGHT or FORWARD and BACKWARD. Can you shoot someone moving in a straight line? Can you shoot something moving left and right? Then you should be able to shoot someone moving up and down. If you can't shoot someone who is simply moving, then the lack of skill would be on your part. Your job is to shoot the enemy. The enemy's job is to not be shot by you. The more skilled player is the one who accomplishes those jobs.

---
The original event calendar says it ends december 26th guys.
---
While the rewards in this game seem pretty lackluster, and I hate the lottery system of scrip, it's not really fair to list the sacrifices you made for this bad drop and portray that as a meaningful part of the equation. The content was designed for 4 players, not 1, so if you spent nearly 3 hours, 50 stims, and all the rest, that's kind of... your own choice? Cause it wasn't designed for that. It's like if you tried to solo a raid in WoW and then complained when your tier gear didn't drop. xD
---
I'm on Xbox and scrapped my santa-tron earlier, saw it mentioned earlier  Just checked and there was a gift of each size in there.
---
Took a while but a small holiday gift appeared in my Santatron earlier.
---
I mean, there are a few known active Adventure mode exploits on the PC at the present time. Just not the theft hack.
---
&gt;A rollback of those players to right before it happened or as close to that as they can would be the best bet.
---
Absolutely this would be best for most but I find it unlikely that BGS has the tools to identify accounts on the PC that have been exploited. They have after all made repeated statements since the beta that they can't selectively restore inventories. The junk episode you reference was also claimed by BGS to be just a cosmetic UI issue and for some that was probably true. When the fixed the UI issue the inventory was "restored." I have read threads were 1st subscribers did not receive a rollback and instead were awarded bulk Atom shop items as compensation.
---
Yeah, I just wish that PA had legendary effects, or more mods, or both.
---
How much? Not sure what they‚Äôre going for. All I got was the Santa crash (not what I was looking for).
---
I have wrapping paper available to me, but then again I haven't even looked for it until now. I'm so low on caps I haven't been checking for it today.
---
Switch servers- it‚Äôs working now for me on PS4.
---
Yeah, since there is no ping monitor in game its kinda hard to pinpoint that, but I'm on fiber and get 20ms-40ms in most servers east coast and central, and like 40-60 west coast.
---
They couldn't put anything in my stash, if I cant they cant..lol
---
Yes there is an auto prime receiver.
---
yeah, no point in spending time dropping them if theyr weightless
---
 You killed a Level 30 Grafton Monster with Gatling Gun? My non melee guy uses a 44 for bigger trash, and my melee guy would just knife him.
---
 What level are you?
---
That is not an "article," it's a random person commenting on the internet. It's not an official statement from Bethesda.
---
Yeah, there aren't a lot of great Endurance perks. I thought maybe you were keeping the special stat # the same. You might try Sunkissed 1, I have that one on several characters or Cannibal 1 is nice to keep from carrying foods around.
---
It‚Äôs fixed. I switched servers and I have gifts again, wrapping paper and vendors, and Santa scorched.
---
What e1 else said, also dont forget your repeatables.
---
It's your light limit, you can have up to 50 of them. The limit was implemented so Bethesda could reduce the budget cost of lights-- they used to be about 4 units each, now they're 2 each. It was actually a positive change (though of course the budget still sucks).
---
That's not even the point, PC Master race so touchy about winning that argument you gotta pick a fight where one isn't XD
---
It sounds like nonsense, kind of like saying that if you raise your luck you get better drops from the purveyor. I don't think there's any truth to it.
---
Don't worry you might lose all your inventory when you do this as well
---
Well it's not a rumor for me or my friends as we have zero Santa scorched, presents, or wrapping paper...and judging from the numerous posts we're not alone. Just because the bug or glitch or whatever it was didn't effect you doesn't mean it didn't happen. That huge legendary glitch that happened recently never effected me..not once did I just assume everyone else was lying....only idiots think like that. But....recent posts have said Bethesda might have corrected it...so good news for everyone if true.
---
I just ran into a couple of Xmas scorched st Morgantown airport myself.
---
If reddit allowed more then 2 pinned post I think this would be a cool idea
---
People can no longer STEAL things from your inventory. They can still ADD things to your inventory. I haven't seen any reports of this happening. There is a lot of SPECULATION that someone could add illegitimate items to your inventory and get you banned, but simply reporting the issue to Bethesda and dropping the items would seem to be an easy work-around for this, just off the top of my head.
---
Turns out to be alt+tabbing causing the problem, if you alt+tab during ANY loading screen at all the game will load all blurry and a mess of pixels, reloading the game completely and not using alt+tab fixed the problem.
---
Is it? I'm scared to log on and check
---
They were removed, probably due to a lack of interest and possibly also to use them as private servers (pure speculation). 
---
PVP is not a big hit in this game. I don't expect much development to happen for it in the future and I wouldn't be surprise if Nuclear Winter was also pulled while still in beta. It's mostly just a generic waste of time.
---
Lol..... qq
---
it's probably related to high refresh monitor and fo76 build in vsync. I did a video about most common performance issues in the past it should help you: 
---
https://youtu.be/VMkq9XdC8lY
---
basically you should open pref.ini and look for ippresentinterval and change value to 0
---
As the Collectrons say... "ERROR"
---
Just found a Santa outside Watoga, fixed?
---
I think we should debate it for another year. :) /s
---
 I'm not familiar with sunkissed what does that do? Thanks for the suggestions.
---
It‚Äôs fixed
---
The big nuka cola billboard I have takes TONS of budget, maybe the equivalent for 2-4 turrets? It‚Äôs ridiculous
---
That's totally fair, and I really do appreciate the fact that we can talk straight about this.
---
For my part, I'll admit I'm a 76 fanboy, not a Bethesda one.
---
I like the idea of 76, and similar games, and I agree that Bethesda has done some irreparable damage to the franchise with their handling of this game.
---
Saying that, maybe you're right...
---
Bethesda won't listen to those who dislike Fallout, and they probably won't listen to those who do.
---
Those of us who do play and enjoy it, we're the ones who have the best chance to make a difference, but that won't happen while we keep quiet and just hope they won't break anything else, or take the game away from us like a naughty child.
---
Sadly, I don't believe anything will change, money makes the world go round, and there will always be those who'll pay, but that doesn't mean I have to be one of them.
---
I'm glad we got to have this chat, thanks.
---
lol Yeah but they fixed the issue with console not spawning scorched apparently, when I logged in I got Santas just fine. Sorry for the fucked PC comment. I know you guys can't help that Bethesda can't deal with hacks proactively
---
As others have pointed out, I noticed a definite improvement for load times and interactions. So in that sense I think it's a notable improvement. However, they're not really the 'ideal 76', as there is still lag, and I sometimes still go into absolute slideshows when in certain areas. 
---
Bottom line for me, private server will improve your experience (assuming you're OK with no other players), but it will not at all make the game the optimized, smooth experience that you probably want. That's not likely to come without a lot more general game improvements from Bethesda.
---
Dang I'm glad I didnt get that one lol
---
It has two ranks, During the day it will slowly get rid of Rads on your character, Second rank works a bit faster. It's a nice passive method to remove rads, and only works between 6am and 6pm. Obviously not for Bloodied builds tho :)
---
I just stand in front of the golf club's door with my Instigating faster swing speed Super Sledge and take the damn ghouls one by one. Even back when I just had an All-Rise, I used to do this, there's no point in wasting ammo there, tbh
---
Yep, these issues don't seem to have that much to do with your specs. 
---
Most common suggestions I've seen:
---
1. Remove or significantly reduce shadows and godrays (best done through ini file)
---
2. Go windowed mode rather than fullscreen
---
3. Change ippresentinterval to 0 in the pref.ini file
---
Fallout fans are so inconsistent on whether they want stuff to be canon. It‚Äôs annoying that they can‚Äôt make new stuff instead of saying they need to add the old shit, it ends up making the game worse and takes away from the creativity that makes these games what they are.

It never was

Clean American flag comes from Pioneer quests

Greek Letters were part of the nukashine quest, I think they come from Biv's daily. (someone correct me here if I am wrong)  I got them when the event was new, so i might be remembering wrong.

It is :)

Wait is the fasnacht event happening again? I would love that. I didn‚Äôt get to participate last time and I would love to get my hands on some plans
---
Same. Distant thunder near watoga.
---
Sorry, i use the wronf word
---
I always wonder why this isn't a thing yet, as you can sell them for roughly 1c each to vendor bots and it doesn't weight anything. I never use them but always carry 100 on me and put everything extra for sale for 1c each on my vendor in case any low level needs it, but even for 1c each and my camp being on the Forest near Flatwoods, these things simply doesn't move.
---
I definitely don't have anywhere close to 50 lights. Unless you count each individual icicle as it's own light.

Seems you‚Äôre a tad too sensitive.

Gift Wrap is back in vendors. Jesus Christ Bethesda get your shit together.

The Greek Letters is definitely from Biv. I think you get it for his second or third quest.

No one really did anything with workshops for ages until Santatrons.  So they're not used, because it's an invite to die rook someone who doesn't even want the workshop.   A hunter/hunted opt-in would allow proper use of workshops and let the hungry eat one another.
---
The vault is supposed to be difficult.  It would be kinda ridiculous if you could breeze through it on your first try.  
---
Novice really isn‚Äôt worth running unless you‚Äôre really familiar with Dead In The Water and use it to collect a guaranteed three star item at the end of 15-20 minutes of work.  There‚Äôs a single and two star miniboss to collect along the way if you want.
---
To me, the strangler power armor is well worth learning DitW for.  That raid is pretty quick once you learn how to do it.
---
&gt; it seems to "run out" quite quickly.
---
True.  So...You need to put 3 points into "Action Boy/Girl" it's in Agility.  You might also consider "Lone Wanderer" in Charisma if you're playing out of a group.
---
You should put a number of points in Agility, as that's where your action points come from.
---
And the modifications you have to your weapon determine the action point cost of VATS.
---
So basically any shmuck can console command it? lol they really need some people that know what they're doing over there
---
Sitting at the vendor on ps4 right now and wrapping paper is still here. Been seeing santas all day today. Had no idea people were having issues until I saw this post.
---
Cause it didn't say shitty shit on the can.
---
Not sure what everyone is going on about. Wrapping paper is in vendor for me (ps4) and have been killing Santa scorched all day, last one was just a few mins ago. Still dropping gifts and legendaries
---
Zomg ir hates you, soooooo sensitive it tickles my pickle
---
It literally deters me from playing not being able to add to my camp. I don't even have a structure and I'm still strapped for budget (obsessive decoration disorder), it's almost pointless me buying anything from the ATOM shop that is camp related.
---
You'll have to log off and back on. Servers had to reset. 
---
Santatron seems to need to be scrapped and rebuilt.  
---
Combination worked for me of public and private servers XB1.
---
I'm very skeptical about the range being increased without some evidence.
---
10-15 is pretty normal. If I‚Äôm crafting serums, I‚Äôll buy at that price if I‚Äôm short on time. It‚Äôs easy to farm if you can kill SB‚Äôs or run the Glassed Cavern.
---
I'm playing right now on xbox, everything is turned back on. It was scheduled to be turned off on the 26th, but it is bow extended till the 31st. Just restart the game and it will be fixed. Happy Hunting
---
We already have/had the reddish/orangey carpet, and there is/was the green astroturf.
---
We still need more, though.
---
To be fair the posts that get pinned here are rarely of any value
---
Have you seen their orange carpet... no thx.  I could go for some marble, different wood, laminate flooring
---
True
---
Do the tappole challenges
---
Same here normally after I do queen runs I'm full with ultracite I sell them for 9-10 caps otherwise if I ever need ultracite  I just go to glasses cavern myself aswell
---
Public Salt Announcement
---
If you're me, you get it everytime you do his quest
---
The point he‚Äôs making is that defenses should do something more than just cost points and resources
---
in fact theres currently only 1 post pinned
---
Next time try #OkBoomer
---
"wow im so original"
---
Fast travel mat first please
---
More frustrating yet, is when all your turrets go hostile on your own camp.
---
If you're in a group, and the leader completes a quest,the group gets a bonus reward but only the leader gets the quest specific rewards.
---
If anybody else in the group completes a quest, only they receive the quest specific rewards.
---
It's a genuine question
---
I set large gifts at 1500 caps in my vending,  sometimes bought then all today. Regulars 1200 and small 700. All gone.
---
What games are you playing?
---
Yes, it took me so long to realize they were just being destroyed by bugs in two hits, and i was just wasting scrap repairing them
---
I've taken the tests, they dont give me badges
---
Yeah absolutely üëç
---
Why do you feel you have to ask his question? Just  curios?
---
Like, ever game? Fallout new vegas (still haven't finished it), Faster than light, Minecraft, Terraria, The Last of us, and Sims 2 and 4
---
There‚Äôs already 3 floor patterns that all suck, as well as multiple rug floor decor in the atomic shop.
---
Might also work on your spelling while you‚Äôre at it.
---
Fair point..... I‚Äôm sick of fast traveling to a CAMP then ending up stuck to the outside of the CAMP building before falling off a cliff...... aaaaaarrrrrgggghhh!!!
---
Why are you playing these games
---
*this and yes.
---
I was just curious.
---
I ain't here to judge the way you get enjoyment or anythin' I just come across a news about fallout 76 every few days and was a bit intrigued.
---
I did that as well and all of them collected gifts.
---
I don't know I think most of them believe it 100% now
---
Yeah, I don't get the Boomer joke.
---
Am... Am I a Boomer?
---
I play it to harass and hack players
---
Because they are games that are made by people who genuinely enjoy making games and are not filled with bugs and doesn't fuck up every few days
---
Yeah I know, like you say they all suck whereas there are actually some nice wallpapers so I‚Äôm sure they could add in nice carpets too. I use the laminated wood in my CAMP but would love to put a plush carpet on the bedroom area floor  üòä
---
So you play them only because they're made by people you like?
---
People are saying it got turned back on but I wasn't playing when people said it turned off for them lol I even uploaded a vid to dispute it
---
Need more mosaic
---
"because they are not filled with bugs and doesn't fuck up every few days"
---
I also play indie games mase by unknown people I'm neutral towards.
---
It‚Äôs a rip in our parents generation...well, mine anyway
---
funny how players against fallout 1st never tried it and complain about it, but once they get the subscription....
---
No, I sold mine in vending for a lot of caps.
---
Been playing for most of the day, haven't had an issues, quit bitching and spreading false info.
---
They always use the same filter, which ruins it. Even on the whitesprings carpet in the atomic shop they added that stupid shag filter instead of using the same texture they used for the carpet that is in the game.
---
I would take this post to the subreddit that cannot be named.
---
Probably wont get much, shotguns are a dying breed.
---
You know, a lot of games are not filled with bugs.
---
Why do you play the ones you listed?
---
It was having issues earlier today, but its been fixed.
---
You know we have requested that since day one they‚Äôve done a lot of good in this game gave us a lot of stuff we asked for but still haven‚Äôt got that
---
Wow dude. Hostile much? It‚Äôs a FACT it was screwed when the event timers reset and it‚Äôs a FACT it is now fixed. Calm down
---
But you‚Äôre definitely right about the carpet also yes we did have the orange shag carpet and the Astroturf
---
I play because I like the trading system, no other fallout or game in general lets you be a wasteland trader. The community is also really cool. Plus aside from the lack of usual conversation simulator elements of Fallout which will be added later, I think it's a really good survival simulator
---
Well because I haven't finished them yet. And some of the games I listed are sandboxes which doesn't have an ending.
---
But you still haven't answered my question, why do you play fallout 76? I get that you enjoy it I'm not judging you for that, but I don't really understand how you still tolerate a company that really doesn't care.
---
Great! You're the only one who answered my question straightforwardly.
---
The cursed boi
---
Also I sold mine for 1.7k caps so, hopefully that's good ?
---
You just literally answered your own question.
---
I have donut and hanging ribbons on my mule
---
I enjoy it.

---
Does anyone know if we‚Äôll still be able to use the wrapping paper after the 31st? Also, will the gifts still be there (without opening them, of course)?
---
Its fun
---
GD it now I want a barber protectron for my camp!
---
Ohhh, no! I was curious about something and wanted an answer. And when that was ignored I asked again! Woe is me
---
Assuming this question is in good faith:
---
I like the idea of it. An open world, online game where I can mess about with friends, without a forced subscription, and I'm curious as to what else might get added or even used in future installments in the series.
---
Assuming this question isn't in good faith:
---
"I'm not being forced to play this game against my will. plz s3nd help."
---
It was not ignored, it was removed my moderators. 
---
This should have been a clue that this type of question is an issue for this subreddit.  
---
Most likely it was removed for being an uncivil post.  Usually these types of questions cause people to fight, so they get removed rather quickly.
---
Ohhhhhhhh here comeses the spellering po-lease
---
Dude you are really fun. I'm glad I get to meet atleast 1 idiot a day. Thank you for the satisfaction
---
I've got a few of them, I can only guess htey drop from enclave events. Usually Dropped Connection Events. I've been doing them to get the Enclave plasma pistols to just scrap and learn the plans.
---
I don‚Äôt even play this anymore and this is unacceptable.
---
Yes, except for anyone that posts a thread on Reddit asking if they fixed it without using the search option, for you it‚Äôs way worse now. 
---
Now hackers can upload and email all your porn to your mom or boss. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry, someone should have told you.
---
are you looking to start a fight.  Because everything  you have said thus far is indicitive of someone wanting to start a fight.
---
Fooled me twice, can't get fooled again!
---
Yeah, I played from WotLK to Cata, dropped it when Mists hit. Been playing FF14 for a while, but decided to unsub for a while.
---
DayZ, that's the main game I play for a similar experience to 76, although it's buggy as hell, it's one of the few games that gives me that feeling.
---
Terraria was one of my favourite games before I had the internet, since there was more choice than Minecraft in gear and designing bases.
---
There was also the white plush carpet (on display at my camp, third floor, XB1)
---
Same for me on Xbox. No wrapping paper at vendors for several hours and no Scorchy Clauses during that time - but my Santatron was still working.
---
All fixed now on Xbox.
---
Welcome to the game! I strongly suggest scrapping EVERYTHING early game.
---
my google news feed works pretty well. It's seems to revel in Bethesda misery.
---
Like the post-war baby boomers?
---
I got the reference (I think), just not the intention, thanks for letting me know.
---
I must have missed that one, thanks for pointing it out.
---
Good work! Kinda tired of actual misinformation spreading around.
---
Has this been fixed?
---
Thats the aim of the game boiii, when you‚Äôre a high enough level with good gear mobs just aren‚Äôt threatening. I‚Äôm a ps4 player and am super stoked for rust coming out next year.
